4/11/2022,"Households in England and Wales will no longer have to pay to get rid of waste created by DIY activities under new plans set out by the government on Monday. At the moment, some local authorities are allowed to charge for the removal of waste such as plasterboard, bath units and bricks, but the proposed changes outlined in a technical consultation would stop this. The move, which is part of a fresh attempt to crack down on fly-tipping, could save consumers up to £10 per individual item, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said. The government banned backdoor charges for individuals disposing of household rubbish at waste centres in 2015. However, about a third of local authorities still charge for certain types of DIY waste, applying rules to residents designed for construction waste. The environment minister Jo Churchill said: “When it comes to fly-tipping, enough is enough. These appalling incidents cost us £392m a year and it is time to put a stop to them. I want to make sure that recycling and the correct disposal of rubbish is free, accessible and easy for householders. No one should be tempted to fly-tip or turn to waste criminals and rogue operators.” Local authorities handled 1.13m fly-tipping incidents in 2020-21, during the Covid-19 pandemic, up 16% on the year before. New council grants totalling £450,000 will be awarded to selected authorities to help them fund a range of projects to catch fly-tippers in action or deter them from dumping waste in the first place. Projects include the use of covert and overt CCTV cameras at hotspot locations; educational programmes to influence behaviour change; and a “no bags on the street” policy to prevent rubbish collections outside business premises. Buckinghamshire council also plans to use artificial intelligence at fly-tipping hotspots, such as rapid deployment cameras and automatic number-plate recognition. These tools link the vehicles of fly-tipping suspects to the disposed-of items in real time, allowing investigating officers to track down culprits quickly. The other councils set to receive the grant are Durham, Newham, Eastleigh Borough, Stevenage, Winchester, Dover, Thanet, Telford and Wrekin, and Basingstoke and Deane. The government is also considering measures to make manufacturers of the most-dumped items – such as furniture and mattresses – responsible for the costs of disposing of waste created by their products. Jacob Hayler, the executive director of the Environmental Services Association (ESA), said he was pleased by the range of measures announced by the government to deter “this deeply antisocial, criminal behaviour”. He said: “In addition to helping individuals recycle their household waste materials at HWRCs [household waste and recycling centres], of particular importance is stopping this material from falling into the hands of organised waste criminals, leading to larger-scale fly-tipping, which is why the ESA also strongly supports digital waste-tracking and reform of the licensing regime for carriers, brokers and dealers of waste material.” Digital waste-tracking involves those handling rubbish recording information from the point the waste is produced to the stage it is disposed of, recycled or reused. It is hoped this will make it easier for regulators to detect illegal waste activity. Marcus Gover, the chief executive of the sustainability charity Wrap, said: “Minimising waste is central to this, and the introductions of grants to reduce fly-tipping across England and Wales are necessary to help prevent the continual environmental cost of this illegal activity.”",News/Environment,DIY waste disposal will no longer incur charge under new plans,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/11/diy-waste-disposal-charges-england-wales-fly-tipping
4/11/2022,"This weekend’s Easter getaway could be the busiest on the UK’s roads in at least eight years as engineering works look set to disrupt rail travel, the RAC has said. An estimated 21.5 million leisure trips will be made by car between Good Friday and Easter Monday, the motoring organisation predicts. That is the most since the organisation began tracking motorists’ Easter plans in 2014. The busiest single day on the roads over the bank holiday weekend is expected to be Good Friday. The west coast railway line will be shut throughout the Easter weekend between London Euston and Milton Keynes Central due to upgrades of the existing line and HS2 work, posing a headache for Liverpool and Manchester City fans travelling down for the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley on Saturday. Customers planning journeys between Euston and Scotland are advised to travel either side of the long weekend. On the roads, the traffic information provider Inrix highlighted several likely congestion hotspots. These include: The M6 north between junction 26 (Orrell interchange, Greater Manchester) and junction 36 (the Lake District). The M25 clockwise from junction 8 (Reigate Hill interchange, Surrey) to junction 16 (Denham interchange, Buckinghamshire). The A303 near Stonehenge, Wiltshire. Drivers wanting to avoid as much congestion as possible are urged to set off before 9am or delay their journeys until after 7.30pm. The RAC traffic spokesperson Rod Dennis said: “After two years of relatively quiet Easter bank holidays on the roads, our research suggests a return to traffic levels that are much more typical of this time of year. It’s very possible this weekend could turn out to be one of the busiest for leisure journeys for many years. “Add in the impact of disruption on the rail network and one of the biggest fixtures of the sporting calendar taking place this weekend, and you have all the ingredients needed for problems on the roads. Traffic volumes will likely be even higher if some warm spring sunshine makes an appearance.” In addition to traffic jams motorists also face the most expensive Easter on record when it comes to fuel prices. Latest government figures show the average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts on 4 April was 161.9p, with diesel at 176p. Some petrol stations in parts of the south and Midlands have been experiencing fuel shortages after the clean energy campaign group Just Stop Oil blockaded oil terminals. Disruption is also expected across other modes of transport over the Easter weekend. Several airlines and airports are struggling to cope with staff sickness and shortages, with thousands of flights cancelled by easyJet and British Airways in recent weeks. Manchester airport is advising departing passengers to expect delays of up to 90 minutes. Large traffic queues are likely to continue on roads in Kent due to a shortage of cross-Channel sailings caused by the suspension of operations by P&O Ferries after it sacked nearly 800 workers. The company hopes to resume services this week pending regulatory approval.",News/UK news,RAC warns of busiest Easter on UK roads in at least eight years,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/rac-warns-busiest-easter-uk-roads
4/11/2022,"Rory McIlroy’s wild celebrations were of a man who had just completed a career grand slam. Instead, Scottie Scheffler comfortably withstood one of the finest rounds in Augusta National’s fabled history to etch his name into folklore as a world No 1 who has won the Masters. Scheffler stood on the 18th tee with a five-shot lead in the 86th staging of this event. The stuff of dreams. A subsequent, messy double bogey mattered not a jot. McIlroy’s race had looked run as he played from bunker to bunker on the tournament’s 72nd hole. Instead, the Northern Irishman holed out from the sand. The subsequent delirium of McIlroy and the galleries will linger as a moment for the ages. His 64 matched the lowest final round recorded in the Masters. His second place represents a career high in this major. Yet this was Scheffler’s day; just as it has been Scheffler’s year. What Scheffler may lack in personality he makes up for with iron accuracy that defies what pressure should do to even professional golfers. There is always a moment. For Scheffler it arrived at Flowering Peach, Augusta’s 3rd hole. Cameron Smith, looking to become the only player other than Tiger Woods to win the Players Championship and Masters in the same year, had reduced Scheffler’s three-stroke lead by two thirds inside two holes. Scheffler had found trouble on the 3rd, from where he could only leave an approach short of the green. What followed was like a heavyweight boxer’s blow to Smith and further proof that everything Scheffler touches in professional context, for the time being at least, turns to gold. Scheffler’s chip was racing at such a pace that it may just have stayed on the green if not hitting the flag and tumbling to the bottom of the cup for a birdie three. As Smith made a bogey, the world No 1’s advantage was three once more. Smith was never to get any closer to Scheffler, who won his maiden major championship by three at 10 under par. His closing round was of 71. As Smith wilted – his aspirations of Masters glory were ended by finding water from the tee at the 12th – McIlroy came charging through the field like a man possessed. McIlroy had been 13 adrift of Scheffler at one point on Saturday afternoon. He started round four 10 shy of the lead. McIlroy reached the turn in 32 and delivered a birdie at the 10th before punching the air at the time of his eagle on 13. Pars at the 15th and 16th looked ominous for the four-time major winner but fireworks were reserved for the last. Scheffler outplayed the field but McIlroy will take obvious heart from what he produced in round four. Scheffler’s birdie at the 14th owed everything to a wonderful approach shot. With McIlroy perched in front of a television and Smith no longer a threat, Scheffler knew he could play the final four holes in three over and still win. Which would have been boring, of course. The 25-year-old made a birdie at the 15th, the final demonstration of a grip he was unwilling to loosen. Scheffler carried his fair share of luck – he would call it providence – en route to victory but that tends to happen when a golfer is amid this kind of run. It won’t always be this way for Scheffler, it just feels otherwise at the moment. Collin Morikawa, playing in McIlroy’s company, also holed out from sand on the last. McIlroy cheered that one as well. Morikawa’s 67 was sufficient for fourth at four under. Shane Lowry’s 69 meant he tied Smith for third, one shot ahead of the Open champion. Justin Thomas’s 73 left him at one under. Will Zalatoris, second in the Masters 12 months ago, further emphasised course specialism with a 67 that vaulted him to three under. Zalatoris therefore finished in a share of sixth. He will be back in 2023. Much earlier, having finished at the foot of the remaining 52-man field, Tyrrell Hatton had publicly gone where few men do by expressing disquiet about the Masters venue. “You can hit good shots here and not get any reward for it,” Hatton said. “It’s unfair at times. I don’t agree with that. If you hit a good shot, you should end up near the hole. Not then short-sided into a bunker because of the slopes that they’ve created and stuff. I don’t think it’s a fair test at times, and when you hit good shots and you’re not rewarded for it, it shows. I haven’t enjoyed it.” Hatton’s membership invite remains stuck in the post. For Scheffler, happier times. To be precise: $2.7m, a Green Jacket and fourth victory of 2022. It is astonishing to think that before the first of them, the Phoenix Open in February, Scheffler had not prevailed on the PGA Tour. He has been utterly relentless since.

4/11/2022,"Chris Bailey, the lead singer of legendary Australian band the Saints, has died. The band announced his death on Facebook on Monday. “It is with great pain in our hearts that we have to inform you about the passing of Chris Bailey, singer and songwriter of The Saints, on April the 9th 2022,” the statement said. “Chris lived a life of poetry and music and stranded on a Saturday night.” Bailey was born in Nanyuki, Kenya, to Irish parents in 1957 and lived the first seven years of his life in Belfast before his family emigrated to Australia. They lived in Inala in Brisbane and he met bandmates Ed Kuepper and Ivor Hay at Corinda state high school. They originally named their band Kid Galahad and the Eternals, changing the name to the Saints in 1974. R.I.P. Chris Bailey who sang perhaps the greatest punk single of alltime https://t.co/UXNZCxbojk The group had their first hit with (I’m) Stranded in 1976 and released their first LP with the same name in 1977. They went on to release 13 more records. Bailey was the only member to be with the band its entire run. The Saints were the core of the Australian punk scene in the 1970s and (I’m) Stranded is regarded as one of the most influential punk songs of all time. In a promotional video for the single’s UK re-release, the INXS frontman, Michael Hutchence, credited the Brisbane band for creating the sound that led to the rapid rise of the Sex Pistols. Bailey was remembered on Monday as “a co-creator of punk music”. Just three days ago, Chris's former bandmate Ed Kuepper posted this new HQ video of The Saints' Paddington Town Hall show in April 1977. Yeah, punk rock in 1977. But they'd been playing for four years by then. They invented it themselves. https://t.co/uES0mbU7gN Another legend down. This one a co-creator of punk music.
