3/7/2022,"Great Britain have won another two medals in the 2022 Beijing Winter Paralympics. In difficult conditions, Menna Fitzpatrick claimed bronze in the women’s super combined visually impaired class, adding to the silver that she won with guide Gary Smith in the Super-G on Sunday. Slovakia’s Henrieta Farkašová won her 11th Paralympics gold in the event, with Zhu Daqing of China taking silver as the hosts continued to dominate the medals table. Britain’s Millie Knight just missed out on the medals in fourth place. The slalom stage of Monday’s combined events was delayed by half an hour, and saw a series of crashes affecting favourites across the events, including in the men’s super combined visually impaired class, where Neil Simpson, guided by his brother Andrew, finished on the podium with a bronze medal. A crash by leader Hyacinthe Deleplace of France on the final slalom run of the competition left Italy’s Giacomo Bertagnolli the winner, and the British brothers in third. Canada’s three-time defending champion Brian McKeever won the gruelling long-distance cross-country visually impaired event again to claim the 14th Winter Paralympic gold medal of a glittering career. It is the 42-year-old’s sixth appearance at a Winter Paralympics. Ukraine’s Oksana Shyshkova won her second gold of these Games with victory in the women’s equivalent. She finished nearly a minute ahead of the rest of the competitors. Natalie Wilkie of Canada made it a double celebration for the Canadians with gold in the women’s cross-country standing long-distance. France’s Cécile Hernandez had to win a court battle over her classification in order to be able to compete in Beijing after the International Paralympic Committee removed her LL1 class from these Games, and she has been rewarded with a gold medal in the LL2 snowboard cross. China took a clean sweep of the podium in the men’s SB-UL event, with Ji Lijia taking the gold. World and Paralympic champion Matti Suur-Hamari of Finland successfully defended his men’s SB-LL2 title won in Pyeongchang. Britain’s wheelchair curlers won their first match in Beijing, with a 15-1 rout of Switzerland in the morning session at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. They sit joint third in the round robin standings. China continue to dominate the medal table, having taken seven golds, eight silver and ten bronze medals in the first three days of sport. The combined total of 25 medals is more than double the next nearest nation, Canada, who have taken 12 medals so far. Ukraine continue to sit second in the medal table. Chinese President Xi Jinping has thanked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and its president Thomas Bach for their role in awarding and helping host the Games, saying that China has delivered on its promise of a “simple, safe and splendid” event. The IOC was widely criticised for giving China the right to host with its human rights record, and in the wake of the treatment of tennis player Peng Shuai. The US and UK were among nations who staged a diplomatic boycott of last month’s Winter Olympics.",Sport/Sport,Fitzpatrick and Simpson add two more Winter Paralympics medals for GB,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/07/menna-fitzpatrick-neil-simpson-add-two-more-british-winter-paralympics-medals
3/7/2022,"As the world scrambles to counter the threat posed by Vladimir Putin, you might think the last thing we need is more inertia. But while that one definition of that word is “a tendency to do nothing”, it also refers to a process that could play a pivotal role in removing fossil fuels from the UK electricity grid, making the country less reliant on gas supplies, including those from Russia. The National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) is announcing a “trail-blazing” greener way of generating inertia, that if all goes to plan should also reduce carbon emissions, rein in household bills and recoup the £336m investment funding it. In this context, the word refers to the tendency in physics for objects to continue in a state of rest or motion, unless another force acts on them. A spinning top exhibits inertia, in that it will keep spinning until friction with the ground eventually causes it to stop. In the electricity system, inertia is crucial in maintaining a stable electrical frequency on the grid, keeping the lights on. In August 2019, more than one million people across the UK were plunged into darkness during one of the worst power blackouts in more than a decade, after the frequency of the grid fell from its usual 50Hz to 48.88Hz. That unprecedented loss of power generation was caused by a lightning strike, but outages can happen for other reasons too, causing a sudden shortfall that knocks the system’s frequency off kilter. As things stand, the grid system usually balances itself automatically thanks to the inertia held in massive spinning turbines at coal and gas power stations – much like a spinning top, but 19.5 metres (64ft) long and made of 300 tonnes of steel and aluminium. They respond instantaneously to a power outage happening elsewhere, spinning ever so slightly slower to offset the disruption and keep the system stable. However, these giant turbines are not a feature of wind or solar power generation, meaning that as the UK aims to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2025 as part of efforts to hit net zero, inertia needs to come from somewhere else. The solution, according to National Grid ESO, whose job it is keeps the electricity network in check, is a series of green turbines created to mimic the effect of their cousins at carbon-emitting fossil fuel plants. With only a small amount of energy fed into them, they can spin at the required rate of 3000RPM, the speed that ensures synchronicity with the 50hz Grid system. The result, in theory, is a solution to the problem of creating inertia in an increasingly wind- and solar-powered electricity system, allowing for a faster push away from fossil fuels that emit carbon and line the pockets of countries such as Russia. In a deployment that puts the UK at the forefront of grid decarbonisation, 2022 is the year these green turbines begin to make their impact. Two got up and running at Keith Greener Grid Park, in Moray, Scotland in late December last year, with four more coming on stream this year. Rassau in south Wales went live last month, a fourth will start spinning at Killingholme in Lincolnshire within weeks, followed by Grain in Kent and Lister Drive in Liverpool this summer. “Building a green system with enough inertia is an engineering challenge for system operators worldwide and we’re the first to be solving it,” says the head of networks at National Grid ESO, Julian Leslie. The ESO believes that it has solved the inertia problem in a way that should make electricity generation cheaper, as well as greener. It has spent £328m on six years of inertia services from the green turbines, set against the £456m it would normally pay, a saving of £21m a year on the portion of electricity bills accounted for by operation of the grid. In addition, a further £7.5m has been spent on a pioneering “sonar” tool, which the grid refers to as the world’s first “ultracapacitor”, based on Teesside. It will send out pulses of energy into the electricity system, precisely measuring the effect on inertia of tiny factors like people using washing machines or vacuum cleaners, in order to ensure grid stability. “It’s a phenomenal thing that nobody has ever done before,” says Leslie. Looking ahead, the next stage in the evolution of this process could be even smarter, with inertia produced not by spinning turbines but by little black boxes, called grid forming inverters, that replicate the laws of physics. The use of these, another world first, could be included in contracts due to be announced in the coming months.",News/Business,Onward inertia! The secret source for keeping the lights on and greening the grid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/onward-inertia-the-secret-source-for-keeping-the-lights-on-and-greening-the-grid
3/7/2022,"In the first of his many bestselling novels, If Only They Could Talk, the newly qualified veterinary surgeon James Herriot arrives in Yorkshire fresh out of Glasgow University. There, the whey-faced and extremely wet‑behind‑the‑ears rookie begins his new life as an assistant in the practice owned by his new boss, Siegfried Farnon. After a couple of weeks going about his business under the hawk-eyed supervision of his extremely eccentric but avuncular employer, Herriot is finally handed the responsibility of working in and around the village of Darrowby on his own. The locals – many of them harbouring deeply entrenched views of how their pets and livestock should be treated – greet his methods and very presence with deep suspicion and mistrust. “I had arrived in the Dales, I felt, at a bad time,” wrote Herriot. “The farmers, after a generation of neglect, had seen the coming of a prophet, the wonderful new vet, Mr Farnon. He appeared like a comet, trailing new ideas in his wake. He was able, energetic and charming and they received him as a maiden would a lover. And now, at the height of the honeymoon, I had to push my way in on the act, and I just wasn’t wanted.” While anyone who has read Herriot’s wonderful canon will be aware he gradually earned the approval and grudging respect of his clientele, it was difficult not to think of his early travails upon hearing that Jesse Marsch had been given the almost impossible task of filling Marcelo Bielsa’s boots in another part of Yorkshire. Everyone old enough to have seen Live Aid remembers Queen’s iconic performance, but significantly fewer can recall the name of the poor sod who was after them on the bill at Wembley. The good news for Marsch is that David Bowie was no slouch either but, like Herriot before him, the American will have to get used to the looks of thinly veiled disappointment of Yorkshire locals upon seeing his arrival unaccompanied each match day on the Elland Road pasture they call home. “Usually they looked past me hopefully,” wrote Herriot. “And some even went and peered into the car to see if the man they really wanted was hiding in there.” To say Bielsa was held in high regard by Leeds United fans who were understandably wary at the time of his appointment would be putting it mildly. Unlike his predecessors, in the wake of his dismissal, he surfed out of the club’s Thorp Arch training ground on a tidal wave of love tinged with what appeared to be genuine grief. And while many are the Leeds fans who accepted results were not good enough and something had to change, there are plenty more who would have mourned relegation from the Premier League with far less sadness than that prompted by the removal of their benevolent dictator. So, Jesse. No pressure; let’s see you follow that. After Saturday’s encouraging, far-from-ignominious defeat at the hands of Leicester, the good news for sceptical Leeds fans is that for all his peculiar foibles – the ability to speak fluent English and a reluctance to sit on upturned buckets – their new manager’s football philosophy and that of his much-loved predecessor do not seem wildly disparate. “We always talk about solidarity, mentality, how you feel in a good team,” said Marsch in an episode of Jeder.Mann – This Is Salzburg, a behind-the-scenes peek at RB Salzburg’s maiden foray into the Champions League group stages, after 11 consecutive failures to qualify, with the American in charge. “I think that’s even more important than results. How many coaches in Europe would say that? Just the craziest one! Just the craziest one but that’s important to me.” Just the craziest one? Not quite. Those characteristics were also conspicuously important to El Loco, as was the focus on intensity, the Protestant work ethic, the togetherness, bravery and compassion espoused by Marsch throughout what amounted to a series of extended adverts for Red Bull. “The character of the team is always the most important thing,” he said, while remaining acutely aware that for all the enthusiasm and togetherness he fostered among the young players in his charge – Erling Haaland, Patson Daka, Takumi Minamino and Enock Mwepu among others – were inherently selfish and using their time at RB Salzburg as a springboard to catapult them on to greater things. In the opening episode of Jeder.Mann, the newly appointed Marsch admits he is acutely aware of the low expectations Salzburg’s fans have of him, given his lack of any great managerial pedigree and the inherent mistrust most Europeans seem to harbour for coaches from America. “We have a saying in English, in America ‘chip on your shoulder’,” he said. “It means I have to prove myself to everyone who doubts me. I have to prove I am good. That’s always in my mind.” It is a notion that will have once again been uppermost in Marsch’s mind when he agreed to take the Leeds job, even if his coaching history and the performance of his players against Leicester suggest he is likely to replicate the high press and high-octane intensity Bielsa invariably demanded. Early evidence suggests he will also work hard to close defensive floodgates that did not so much leak as haemorrhage goals in the final games of the Argentinian’s regime.“I don’t have to be Marcelo Bielsa,” said Marsch at his unveiling. “I’ve said I’ve followed Marcelo’s career and watched him closely, and respect and learned from things he’s done. I am different, I am my own person and I have my own ways.” They are words that will have been greeted with frosty scepticism by pessimistic, mourning Leeds fans but in time and with more performances like Saturday’s one suspects they may eventually thaw.",Sport/Football,"Jesse Marsch, James Herriot and all sceptics great and small in Leeds | Barry Glendenning",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/07/jesse-marsch-james-herriot-and-all-sceptics-great-and-small-in-leeds
3/7/2022,"I’m one of the fortunate people who is yet to test positive for Covid. This is despite the fact that I work with live replicating Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid) for my research, teach face-to-face at university, and have school-age children. My fully vaccinated healthy friends of the same age were not so lucky, and some have suffered from more than one case of Covid in the past couple of years. What does this reveal about my immune system? First, we have to consider a number of scenarios. There is a very small chance that I have never come into contact with the virus. But given the duration of the pandemic, and the number of highly transmissible variants, this is unlikely. Then there is the chance that I have come into contact with Sars-CoV-2, but it was cleared from my body quickly before it developed into the disease Covid (abortive infection). At the start of the pandemic, and before I was vaccinated, I could have caught the virus but I could have been one of the small number of people who did not display symptoms and therefore did not test for it. Some people may clear the virus quickly because they have pre-existing antibodies and memory immune cells that recognise the virus. These could be cross-reactive memory T-cells generated previously to fight similar coronaviruses that cause the common cold. There is evidence of higher prevalence of endemic (non-Covid) coronavirus infections in the young and reduced cross-reactive T-cell presence in older people. When vaccines became available, I received my first and second doses, along with a booster shot. Vaccines work by introducing our immune system to the virus spike protein, and setting off an early arsenal of specific antibodies and T-cells. These leave memory cells behind, which can persist for years and spring into action to prevent reinfection. Although Covid vaccines still protect from severe disease, each time there is a new variant we scientists frantically search for any evidence of vaccine escape in real-life data. We can’t predict vaccine escape because we are not observing stepwise virus evolution, where emerging strains add new mutations to their predecessors; the now-prevalent Omicron variant has few similarities with Delta, which was spread widely last year. Natural infection does not offer long-term protection, and the more potent vaccine-induced immunity needs a booster to protect against variants. As a result, if I had previously caught but coped well with one variant, I am not convinced that I would be immune to the next one. Indeed, people report different symptoms after different rounds of infection, some doing better, some worse in later infections. There is also a possibility that different immune systems respond differently to the virus. For Sars-CoV-2 to infect, the spike protein on the surface of the virus needs to stick to specific proteins on the target cells, like the ACE2 protein. Is it possible that those resistant to infection have different levels of ACE2 than others? Age-related ACE2 expression in the lungs of children compared with adults may partly explain why children often show milder infection. It is also possible that some of us may have rare types of ACE2 that the coronavirus spike cannot stick to. Differences in protein expression between people are known as polymorphisms, and they are valuable to discover. People that have a rare genetic polymorphism for CCR5 protein have been immune to HIV infection. To support this theory, recent genetic analyses have revealed that rare types of ACE2 may influence susceptibility to Covid. Additionally, studies in healthcare workers who consistently remained negative for Covid showed the presence of pre-existing T-cells that recognise peptides – the chain of molecules that make up a protein – from less variable parts of the virus than the spike protein (which, under pressure from our immune response, mutates frequently to evade our antibodies). This work suggests that it would be wise to not rely on spike-targeting vaccines if we want to induce immunity to new variants, and we should think about incorporating more parts of the virus that don’t change over time (“evolutionarily conserved proteins”) into our vaccine design. While we are still learning about what may be causing Covid resistance, we can’t be sure why someone like me hasn’t yet tested positive. But what I do know is that because of the likelihood of emerging variants, there is no guarantee that I won’t develop Covid still. Even if you’ve been lucky so far, don’t take your chances.

3/7/2022,"After 35 minutes, a free-flowing Manchester derby ground to a halt so that a supporter could receive medical attention. The players took the opportunity for a drinks break. Pep Guardiola seized the moment and gave João Cancelo a dressing-down: a proper Pep talk. It was animated, intense, cartoonish, and very Guardiola. Ralf Rangnick spoke to his team too, but in his usual measured way – managerial rather than inspirational. He had tried to play Guardiola at his own game, which was bold. “I see your false nine,” he seemed to say, “and I raise you … two false nines!” Manchester United were trying to out-pass Manchester City, which is like trying to out-press Liverpool. A depleted United made a decent fist of it in the first half, even though Kevin De Bruyne was running through his greatest hits. But whatever Guardiola said at half time lifted City to another level. United fell apart and Guardiola, whose record in home derbies is curiously patchy, was rewarded with his biggest win over them. Tim de Lisle Match report: Manchester City 4-1 Manchester United Whatever happened to Marcus Rashford? He used to love a Manchester derby, feeling it in his bones as a Wythenshawe boy, running rings round Martín Demichelis. If Ralf Rangnick had known about that, Rashford might have got a start on Sunday. As it was, he was left on the bench, even though all United’s other strikers were indisposed: Cristiano Ronaldo injured, Mason Greenwood unavailable, Anthony Martial loaned out, Edinson Cavani fussing about his fitness. The obvious move was to rehabilitate Rashford and back him to turn a corner. Instead Rangnick showed so little faith in him that he fielded two false nines, Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba, plus his preferred wingers in Jadon Sancho and Anthony Elanga. Sancho rose to the challenge, Elanga wilted and by the time Rashford appeared, the game was up. He had one chance to show his pace and his class, but as so often in recent weeks he dithered and ran into traffic. Rangnick, who had talked about Rashford as if he was a beginner, may need to remind him how good he can be. TdL When Ollie Watkins confessed that Philippe Coutinho thinks too quickly for him and that he can find himself fooled by his new teammate’s movement, one of the Brazilian’s former colleagues could surely empathise. Steven Gerrard jokingly attributed his 2015 decision to leave Liverpool to Coutinho. “He was one of the reasons I called it a day and went to America,” he said. “In most training sessions, he was too quick for me. He is the reason I have six screws in my left groin and I am probably on my way to a new hip.” If it explains why Coutinho was too good for Southampton, it underlines why Gerrard wants a special talent in his side to help propel Villa to another level. “All good teams have these type of players, game-changers who the opposition are really concerned about before a ball is kicked,” he said. “Phil has that status.” Richard Jolly Match report: Aston Villa 4-0 Southampton As one of Eddie Howe’s managerial predecessors at Newcastle once put it, “possession can be overrated”. Alan Pardew’s point appeared vindicated as, despite Brighton enjoying 68% of possession, they lost a fourth straight league game. In contrast, Howe’s team have won five of their last six and are unbeaten in eight. Steve Bruce’s successor has transformed certain players almost beyond recognition. Ryan Fraser – the scorer of one goal and creator of the other – is a reborn winger while Fabian Schär, who headed the second goal and has formed a solid partnership with the outstanding Dan Burn, no longer looks a liability and Joelinton is a big hit as a reinvented midfielder. It speaks volumes that Bruno Guimarães, Howe’s marquee January signing from Lyon, was restricted to a tantalisingly promising late cameo from the bench. Louise Taylor Match report: Newcastle 2-1 Brighton The return of Reece James after two months out is a bittersweet moment for Chelsea. Sweet because of his importance to Thomas Tuchel’s system: his energy and movement, dribbling and finishing, as displayed in the 4-0 win against Burnley. Bitter because, as Tuchel put it, “once he plays you see what you missed”. It’s no exaggeration to posit that Chelsea might still be in the title race but for his absences: of the four games against Liverpool and Manchester City, he missed two, went off injured in one and was sent off at Anfield with Chelsea 1-0 up. Chelsea won none of those games. Jonathan Liew  Match report: Burnley 0-4 Chelsea As Brendan Rodgers’s key players trickle back from injury, it is increasingly difficult to ignore the emergence of the latest homegrown Leicester player to seize his chance. Harvey Barnes’s sleek finish was the difference against Leeds on Saturday but Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, who joined the club aged eight, put in another all-action display and his manager believes the 23-year-old midfielder, who excelled on loan at Luton last season after a spell at Blackpool, has the makings of a future captain. “He’s a real throwback for me,” Rodgers said. “He is one that can get up and down, but also put his foot in – he loves a tackle. I think at some point he’ll be a skipper here. He leads, he inspires, he’ll give a voice – he’ll say what he thinks. But he is very respectful, very humble, and is a great ambassador for the club and for the academy.” Ben Fisher Match report: Leicester 1-0 Leeds United The attacking riches of the Premier League’s top two enthral but defensive pedigree has also shaped the destination of recent titles and may do so again. Liverpool’s title defence eroded without Virgil van Dijk and company last season; the year before, Manchester City were unable to keep pace with Jürgen Klopp’s champions after losing Aymeric Laporte. Collectively, Liverpool struggled to contain West Ham and Michail Antonio in particular yet individual contributions from Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson, Ibrahima Konaté and Naby Keïta were critical to securing a fortunate, invaluable win. “If the organisation is wrong for a moment it doesn’t mean you can’t defend the situation in other ways,” as Klopp put it. Alexander-Arnold broke his own record by registering a 16th assist of the season, with a potential 20 games still to play. “He knows where the dangerous situations are in the opposition box,” said his manager. “It is also very helpful when you work together for a long time because the strikers know what to expect.” Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 1-0 West Ham United Bukayo Saka’s levels just get higher and higher. He has more direct goal involvements this season – 13 – than any top-flight player under 21 and recorded two of them with a goal and assist against Watford. Saka is still a young player and that is evident in his freshness; there is a cleanness and clarity to his play, though, that would befit a top footballer many years older. Mikel Arteta believes his experience from Euro 2020, when he missed a key penalty in the final and took awful abuse on social media, has made him stronger. “I think so,” he said. “I think experiences like that mark your career. And what you learn from those difficult moments is much more probably than if you had scored that goal.” Saka has gone on to score and set up plenty more; he is the driving force in a vibrant side that has a return to the big time in its grasp. Nick Ames  Match report: Watford 2-3 Arsenal The headlines were beckoning Christian Eriksen, making his first start for Brentford at Norwich, but nobody told Ivan Toney. After getting back in the groove by scoring three times in his previous four games, he scored three times in half an hour. A crisp tap-in at the far post after a corner, two ice-cold penalties – both slotted to Tim Krul’s right – and Toney had not just the match ball but Brentford’s first-ever hat-trick in the top flight. Norwich registered more shots (15 to Brentford’s 10) and possession (59%) but Brentford were far more efficient thanks to Eriksen’s effortless corners and Toney’s fine finishing. After a drought in December, Toney now has 11 goals from 27 Premier League appearances. A year and a half ago, Brentford paid £6m for Toney. He is worth a fair bit more now. Tim de Lisle Match report: Norwich 1-3 Brentford Wilfried Zaha has long been renowned for his mercurial creative skills but, at 29, he is now proving he can combine craft with graft. The Ivory Coast winger, due to face England at Wembley this month, scored his ninth Premier League goal of the season, from the penalty spot, to seal Saturday’s superb 2-0 win at Wolves after making the first for Jean-Philippe Mateta. But it was his tracking and pressing that showed how much he has developed under Patrick Vieira this season. “He’s in a good period,” the Palace manager said. “He was fantastic out of possession. We played well and he was part of the team that defended well.” When asked whether Zaha’s temperament had improved, Vieira replied: “I don’t want that to change, because that’s part of who he is, and we need this kind of passion.” Peter Lansley Match report: Wolves 0-2 Crystal Palace",Sport/Football,Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action
3/7/2022,"It was one of those surreal moments when light entertainment mugs history. Vladimir Putin crooned the song Blueberry Hill at a children’s charity benefit in St Petersburg in 2010, as a crowd of celebrities – including Sharon Stone, Kevin Costner, Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn, Gérard Depardieu, Vincent Cassel and Monica Bellucci – clapped along like they were in kindergarten. When the politician reeled off the opening line – “I found my thrill” – thoughts of the Georgian invasion or the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko didn’t seem to be urgently popping into anyone’s head. Knowing what we know now, the spectacle plays more like Dr Evil’s rendition of Just the Two of Us – but far less funny. In 2022, after Putin’s ruthless assault on Ukraine, the guests present that day must feel very naive, perhaps even ashamed – but they are not the only western celebs who cosied up to Putin. In defence of this bunch, they had been booked to appear by Samuel Aroutiounian, a New Yorker who specialised in bringing Hollywood talent to Russia and later said that he had been unaware Putin would be appearing. Now, as big names from Angelina Jolie to Sean Penn and Mark Ruffalo issue their support for besieged Ukraine, Hollywood must be cringing at the days when a public appearance with Putin wasn’t beyond the pale. In the mid-00s, he had merely nibbled at a few former Soviet provinces and seen off the odd dissident – events that didn’t trouble most Entertainment Weekly readers. Russia was an important emerging film market, and firmly on the celebrity junket circuit. So Jean-Claude Van Damme, in 2007, could happily buff the president’s macho credentials at a St Petersburg MMA event, while Leonardo DiCaprio purred at his fellow feline lover during a big-cat conservation summit in 2010. His hegemony firmly established by then, Putin already had a domestic entertainment machine working hard in his favour. Channel One – descendant of the Soviet-era state TV station RTO – had produced Night Watch and Day Watch, two aspiring global blockbusters that put a manichaean gloss on the chaotic post-communist Russia that Putin had quelled in the early 21st century. “Dark means freedom and light means responsibility – and, in real life, Putin, for sure, is a light one,” said director Timur Bekmambetov at the time. “He is trying to fix everything, make everything organised. But it’s very bad for freedom.” Perhaps the succession of jingoistic military films the Russian cinema industry was also starting to churn out – which included 2005’s 9th Company, 2008’s Admiral and 2013’s Stalingrad – were a true bellwether of his actual allegiance. But Putin – lambasted for his aggressions in Chechnya and Georgia, and with suspicions swirling around state agencies after the killings of Litvinenko and Anna Politkovskaya – was sorely in need of international legitimacy. Photo ops with big stars and the implied entry into the VIP area of global mass entertainment helped normalise his rogue state in the eyes of the world. Or so he assumed. By 2014, when Putin had annexed Crimea and by which time it was obvious he wasn’t going to surrender the leadership any time soon, Hollywood was starting to run shy. Talking to Time magazine, Blueberry Hill mastermind Aroutiounian said of the A-list: “They’re much more concerned about not killing their careers. [In the current political climate] they don’t know what will happen to them when they come back home. They will take a lot of heat.” With his inscrutable air, machiavellian geopolitical schemes and his critics’ habit of dying in outlandish assassinations, Putin was increasingly resembling a cartoonish arch-villain of the Blofeld ilk. His foreign military intelligence agency was even called GRU, like the Despicable Me baddie. But there remained a coterie of film-world refuseniks who were unbothered by his growing pariah status: not just Depardieu, but Mickey Rourke, Steven Seagal and director Oliver Stone. In fact, this set of leathery iconoclasts and libertarians seemed to actively embrace it. Three of them fell into the useful-idiot camp. Depardieu took Russian citizenship, and its refreshing 13% flat tax rate, in 2013, after criticising the French government over its levying plans. On friendly terms with Putin, he called Russia “a great democracy” in an open letter. At a Latvian film festival in 2014, Depardieu was sufficiently high on great sentiments to declare Ukraine “part of Russia”. Cue tanks rolling across the border in 2022 and the sound of tarte à l’humble being scoffed: “I am against this fratricidal war,” he said. “I say, ‘Stop the weapons and negotiate.’” Rourke, meanwhile, was unfazed by Putin’s Crimea incursion and judged him “a real gentleman” while buying a T-shirt with the leader’s face on it at a Moscow department store in 2014. “I met him a couple of times and he was a very cool regular guy, looked me right in the eye,” he told Sky News. It’s easy to assume this was some kind of edgelord publicity stunt from the one-time hellraiser, but he offered up his Russian girlfriend as the real reason: “It’s all about family. I don’t give a fuck about the politics. That’s not my department.” Seagal doesn’t even try to play that get-out-of-jail-free card. Granted Russian citizenship in 2016, he had already called Putin’s Crimea annexation “very reasonable” and lauded the president as “one of the world’s greatest living leaders”. With his old pal now trashing the rest of Ukraine, he’s only dialled down his support one notch: “I look at Russia and Ukraine as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other,” he told Fox News. You can see why – in a kind of Botoxed 21st-century version of the Hollywood Ten – three over-the-hill blowhard actors might identify and want to shack up with the Russian president. Stone’s case is more complicated. He had already made documentaries about Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez, so with his past proclivity for revolutionary figureheads, Putin was a logical next candidate. The director’s four-hour 2017 series, The Putin Interviews, undoubtedly indulges the leader but in doing so it draws him out in all his bland cynicism. It also picks its moments to challenge him: on Chechnya, on Russian “democracy”, on election interference. It’s not hard to understand what Stone got out of discussing realpolitik with his country’s adversary. The bigger question is how Putin benefited from this arrangement. Could the series, in continually insisting on the equivalence between US and Russian expansionism, have been part of his broader disinformation strategy? To throw a tantalising bone to sympathetic liberal anti-imperialists to distract them from his real endeavour during the period: radicalising the US and Europe’s nativist right wing. At least Stone’s dalliance with Putin gave us an opportunity to sit and watch the surface of the man – even if it didn’t quite get at what lay beyond. In one remarkable vignette, the director gets the autocrat to sit for his first viewing of Dr Strangelove. As the climactic mushroom-cloud montage plays out, Putin seems faintly amused by this depiction of mutually assured destruction: “Nothing has changed.” Maybe that’s what the Moscow celebrity train has helped obscure all along – for Putin, it has always really been about a colder, harsher reality.",Arts/Film,Putin’s Hollywood pals – the stars who snuggled up to the Russian dictator,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/putin-hollywood-pals-leonardo-dicaprio-steven-seagal-depardieu-rourke-stars-snuggled-up-russian-dictator
3/7/2022,"The Australian Defence Force has defended the speed of its response to flooded communities in northern New South Wales, after locals in Lismore resorted to crowdfunding helicopters to drop off supplies to isolated residents. As of Monday there were 637 ADF personnel on the ground in northern NSW, including in liaison and planning roles, with another 656 due to arrive by Tuesday evening. There were 1,358 ADF personnel deployed in southern Queensland. Major general David Thomae said the army had been on the ground in Lismore since 27 February, and had provided air support to flood affected regions in both states since the 25 February, when federal government activated the commonwealth disaster plan which allows the ADF to be deployed. But some locals have criticised the ADF’s efforts. A video appearing to show ADF personnel being filmed unloading a trailer was widely shared on social media, leading to criticism that the army had prioritised a photo opportunity over rendering assistance. Asked if they could have done more, Thomae told reporters on Monday: “I think we have done all that we can within the conditions we have been faced with.” “It is great to see other community members supporting their own community,” he said. “It is not just an ADF response, it is the local government and local emergency services who were working very hard over the last week. We support them. “If local communities are supporting their own community, I think that is a great thing.” Thomae said the ADF had rescued 113 people from flood waters and conducted helicopter missions to rescue 79 people from roofs. “I am very sorry for all of those people who have felt that they haven’t been supported,” he said. “I empathise completely with their plight.” He defended the speed of the ADF response, saying they had moved in “as soon as weather and conditions allowed”. “We have to operate in a safe matter,” he said. “If our aircraft cannot safely operate to get into those locations because of the conditions last week, then that explains part of what you are asking.” Thomae said the ADF was not able to respond to the flood crisis until the commonwealth disaster plan was enacted on 25 February, and its initial response was a force of 150 officers kept on standby during summer to respond to national disasters. The deputy Labor leader, Richard Marles, who travelled to Lismore on Monday, accused the federal government of failing to provide leadership in coordinating the disaster response. “It’s not enough to treat this as just a normal disaster and business as usual,” Marles said. “This is a catastrophe on a huge scale which demands national leadership and coordination right now, which is missing. Normal responses aren’t going to cut it.” Labor MP Justine Elliot, whose electorate of Richmond takes in the Byron and Mullumbimby areas, said federal and state governments had failed the area “at every step of the way”. “People on the ground are doing an incredible job, but they should have had a coordinated disaster plan in place,” she said. “We had poor volunteers in dinghies, we had people coordinating on my Facebook page to rescue people from caravans. It’s heartbreaking.” Elliot said the situation in Mullumbimby, where some people have been cut off without access to essential services due to floods and landslides, was a “humanitarian crisis”. The ADF response to that town was “just not happening,” she said. “There’s hardly anyone on the ground. “We keep getting told ‘they’ll be here tomorrow’, but it’s been the community that has stepped up with food, water, rescuing people, hiring helicopters. The community has been doing what the army and government should be doing.” Federal agriculture minister David Littleproud defended the deployment of defence personnel, saying the federal government would “only send the ADF in when we’re requested by the states.” “ADF personnel aren’t trained in the immediate response” the former emergency management minister told Sky News. “They aren’t trained the way SES people are. And so if we send them in too early they can get in the road.” Neil James, the executive director for independent defence watchdog the Australian Defence Association, said the heavy reliance of the ADF in civilian roles since 2019 had created a perception that the army was “an inexhaustible source of people that you can pump into wherever you need it”. “That’s just not true, the ADF is quite overstretched,” James said. The ADF were tasked to respond to the 2019-2020 bushfires and in various parts of the pandemic response, from hotel quarantine, to enforcing lockdown orders in Melbourne, to assisting in health departments and aged care. But responding to domestic emergencies is not the ADF’s core responsibility, despite legislation passed in 2020 to streamline the process to call them in to assist. And most resources in Australia are stationed in the far north, making deployment any further south than Townsville a lengthy process. “There’s this naive belief in parts of the community that if you have a problem, the defence force will turn up immediately to help,” James said. “There’s also this belief that everyone in the defence force is capable of doing everything, but they have not been trained for everything.”",News/Australia news,ADF defends floods response after Lismore residents organise helicopters for supply drops,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/07/adf-defends-floods-response-after-lismore-residents-organise-helicopters-for-supply-drops
3/7/2022,"Street artist Basil Matsika paints murals of local musicians and daily life in the streets of Mbare, one of Zimbabwe’s oldest townships, in the capital Harare. With his brush and paint jar, he says he communicates deep sentiments of hope amid the overwhelming landscape of poverty. While many see Mbare as a crime-ridden neighbourhood, Matsika, 40, chooses to see beauty in the grimy, patched walls of the Matapi flats, which have become his canvas for his giant murals. He starts by sketching the image with a pencil before applying paint. It takes a day or two to complete his murals, covering up some of the more crude writings on the walls. “We normally replace vulgar graffiti from the walls by painting murals of our local heroes,” says Matsika. “To protect the children and the community from being exposed to obscene language, I paint. I choose to bring out something beautiful from what the society regards as filthy,” says Matsika, adding that his art is meant to protect the history of Mbare. “We always want to promote good themes in our art because, as you know, Mbare is known for bad things.” Matsika says the history of Mbare is intertwined with music. The township prides itself on raising famous Zimdancehall stars, so he often paints musicians. “These are our local heroes. They have put Mbare on the map and, in return, I have painted murals for posterity. This will teach our children that we have great people among us,” he says. “This is like our own museum. We are documenting our own history: 100 years from now, they will know that there was a particular artist who came out of this community.” From footballers to musicians and actors, Mbare continues to defy the odds of poverty to produce national heroes, some of whom are depicted in murals along the muddy Matapi Road. Mbare arts manager Abraham Chimweta says: “Passersby never miss an opportunity to pose for a picture here and this makes me very proud that our art is being appreciated. Even people from the suburbs come here to take photos beside their favourite artists.” At Jeskas Corner, a popular food spot, children play while a group of young men plays cards, nervously looking out for the police. The area has become the city’s home of graffiti and around them the murals tell a story of Mbare, with well-known dancehall artists painted on every wall. Zimdancehall, an adaptation of Jamaican dancehall, is music that resonates with daily struggles. The infectious lyrics – often a lament of life’s challenges, losses, and social ills, such as the rising drug problems – have become the soundtrack for Zimbabwean life here. The murals include a portrait of the late Zimdancehall star, Soul Jah Love, who came from these streets and was declared a national hero after his death, last year. “Our artists will for ever live among us. His spirit lives on through this art. There is no other honour we can bestow on him,” says Chimweta. Other Zimdancehall stars honoured here include Seh Calaz and Killer T, while Bob Marley, Haile Selassie and Zimbabwe’s late former president, Robert Mugabe, also feature. Mbare has inspired works by overseas artists, too. As part of the Harare international festival of arts in 2010, Dutch artist Roy Valk painted a mural of two happy sisters at Matapi flats. Matsika says he has had his fair share of brushes with the local authorities. “When I started, the council was always on my tail. They said I had broken bylaws on graffiti, but I explained that it was a community project and helping to keep the flats. I am glad they understood,” he says. “I do this because I love our art. I never get paid for this; I use my own materials. But it has unlocked many doors to my next paycheque. I am now being called to do murals for business centres, studios and in private spaces,” Matsika says. He dreams of opening studios and buying scaffolding to create bigger murals. “We are constrained because of lack of capacity. I need scaffolds because, right now, I cannot do lofty paintings,” he says. Matsika is also paints abstract works on canvas and hopes the local gallery will showcase his work. “On canvas, I express myself better and can literally bring any theme to life. Our story in Mbare needs to be told,” he says.
