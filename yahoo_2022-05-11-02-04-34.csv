5/11/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Dennis Gartman says U.S. stocks are and will be in a bear market until a one-day “violent, downward movement” signals that prices have reached bottom.

Be less long. Try to be as conservative as one can be,” Gartman said. “He or she who loses the least shall be the winner.” People are still comfortable buying price dips in stocks, and until they give up on that approach and the market delivers a “three or four or 5% decline in one day and another washout, I’ll have to stay bearish,” he said. The traditional definition of a bear market is a drop of 20%. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index is down about 25% this year, while the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has fallen around 16%. Its biggest one-day decline in 2022 was -3.63% on April 29. Reduced Exposure Gartman, the former publisher of the influential “The Gartman Letter,” has been bearish for months. In January, he said stocks could face a decline of as much as 15% in 2022, and he reduced the equity portion of the university’s endowment by a range of 12% to 15% on Dec. 31. “Last February, I actually moved us out of 3% of our equities and moved us into 3% gold,” he said. “I’m comfortable with doing that.” The main reason for stocks’ declines, a phenomenon hitting markets globally, is central banks’ shift from very easy monetary policy to tightening to cool the hottest inflation in decades, he said. “It’s predicated upon the fact that the monetary authorities, especially here in the U.S., that have been so expansionary for such a long period of time are now being contractionary,” he said. “And they’re going to remain contractionary, trying to fight against the inflationary pressures that they themselves have engendered through their own expansionary policies over the course of the past near-decade.” The Federal Reserve last week raised overnight lending rates for the second time this year, the latest a half-point increase, and has made clear its intention to tighten policy further to tame inflation. Gartman in the past has said he was wrong about a bear market in 2021, when the S&P index rose about 27%. But this year, he said, the market will continue to see declines and volatility. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, sometimes referred to as the fear index, “has not been that high yet,” said Gartman. “It’s up in the 30s. We’ll get it up into the 40s.

5/11/2022,"A short-seller known for uncovering the Nikola Motor fraud has bet against Twitter, warning publicly that Elon Musk has “all the cards” to renegotiate a lower price. In a statement on Monday, Hindenburg Research concluded the deal’s $1-billion breakup fee was not a sufficient enough deterrent given the heady cocktail of poor first-quarter results and inflated user numbers for the social media platform, as well as an ongoing market crash in tech stocks. That gives the Tesla CEO an opening to pressure Twitter’s board into accepting more favorable terms by threatening to abandon the bid entirely and let the share tank, Hindenburg said. “We believe that if Elon Musk’s bid for Twitter disappeared tomorrow, Twitter’s equity would fall by 50% from current levels,” it wrote, adding it was now actively shorting the social media company. “Consequently, we see a significant risk that the deal gets repriced lower.” https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1523693971842957312?s=20u0026t=aMKYhNZlVECrEKqgrFBnZA The centibillionaire responded with a cryptic non-statement that revealed little as to whether he disagreed with the underlying analysis: “Interesting,” he posted via Twitter. “Don’t forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!” Hindenburg Research is probably best known for blowing the whistle on Nikola Motor CEO Trevor Milton’s fraudulent attempt to pass off his hydrogen fuel cell truck rolling downhill as being driven by his own proprietary propulsion technology. Milton is now awaiting trial on criminal charges he lied to investors. Thanks to Musk’s Twitter bid, approved unanimously by the board late last month and announced by chairman Bret Taylor, its stock has succeeded in largely decoupling itself from the broader tech market. The share price is now essentially little more than a barometer of investor confidence in Musk’s deal going through at the $54.20 offer. Twitter has climbed 22% since April 1, before news broke of Musk’s 9.2% stake purchase, to finish Monday’s session at $47.96. While that indicates the market still sees a material execution risk for the deal, it has proved far more resilient than the broader tech sector. This outperformance is not because of strong fundamentals, but solely down to the existence of Musk’s bid propping up the price. By comparison, the Nasdaq Composite has lost nearly a fifth of its value over the same period of time. Pricing a similar drop into the $44 billion offer would mean Musk could lower the cost of the deal by a good $7 billion after paying the breakup fee. Even a conservative 10% reduction to the bid price to reflect prevailing market conditions would still save him billions. https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1518664847768006656?s=20u0026t=ofgvijuNsWr8VrM2ldhlBA Considering that the current deal would encumber Twitter’s balance sheet with some $13 billion in debt, or nearly nine times its annual underlying cash earnings (Ebitda), Hindenburg Research argued a lower price with a less aggressive financing profile would furthermore put the acquisition on more solid financial footing. “The heavy debt load would make it more challenging to pursue Musk’s goal of reducing Twitter’s reliance on advertising, which currently comprises the vast majority of its revenue,” it wrote. Importantly, Musk is also not the only one fronting capital for the deal—and therefore not the only one calling the shots either. In order to avoid liquidating any more of his Tesla stake or pledging too many shares as collateral, he recently enlisted help from Wall Street whales to finance the deal with over $7 billion of their own money. Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, as well as crypto exchange Binance were just a few to be tempted by heady growth targets such as a fivefold increase in Twitter’s annual revenue by 2028. These investors would likely advocate more favorable terms should they see any opening to extract meaningful concessions, according to Hindenburg Research. Since the Tesla CEO’s current offer was “vastly superior to alternatives,” the short-seller warned there was little alternative for Twitter’s board than to accept any revised terms—a situation that presents a key risk to existing shareholders. “Musk has incredible leverage to renegotiate should he choose to,” Hindenburg Research concluded.

5/11/2022,"What to make of the markets right now? Last week brought more losses in what’s been a volatile year for stocks. The five straight weeks of market declines marked the longest such streak in over a decade. More ominously, they came in along with a number of other disturbing data points. The April jobs numbers, released on Friday, came to 428,000 jobs added for the month, superficially strong and well above the 391,000 expected. But the labor remains depressed, and the total number of workers, even after a year of strong gains, is still 1.2 million below its pre-pandemic peak. Worse, the 5.5% wage gains in April, the fifth month in a row that wages grew more than 5%, did not keep pace with the 8.5% annualized inflation rate. Workers are getting paid more, but are still falling behind. On top of that, the high inflation rate has spurred the Fed to start boosting interest rates. The last increase, of 0.5%, was the largest increase in more than two decades, and is already being reflected in higher bond yields (the 10-year Treasury note is above 3%) and increasing mortgage rates. For investors, however, conditions are pointing toward bargain hunting – finding the stocks that are running cheap but with the potential for high returns in the long term. With that in mind, we’ve used the data at TipRanks to pull up three stocks that are showing 50% or greater losses for the year so far – but that also show Strong Buy ratings from the Street and the potential to double or more in the coming year. Here’s the lowdown. Kornit Digital (KRNT) We’ll start with a tech firm in the textile industry. Kornit bills itself as a global digital printing company, specializing in high-speed, industrial-grade ink jet printers, along with pigments and chemical products, for the garment, apparel, home goods, and decorating sectors. The company’s machines are capable of printing complex designs directly onto finished textiles, allowing fabric workers to call up patterned textiles on demand. This frees up inventory space and eliminates redundancies, important considerations for Kornit’s customer base. One number will suffice to show the scale of Kornit’s work and niche: there are more than 150 million garment designs printed every year on Kornit machines. The company coordinates this work through 5 global offices in New Jersey, Miami, Dusseldorf, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. The company will report its 1Q22 financial results this Wednesday, May 11, but we can get a good feel for its current situation by looking back at the previous quarters. In the second half of 2021, Kornit saw solid revenue numbers, with the Q4 figure of $87.5 million being a company quarterly record. The full-year top line for 2021 was $322 million, up 67% year-over-year. The company was profitable, with a 2-cent GAAP earnings per diluted share in the quarter, and 13 cents for the full year. Despite these positive metrics, the company’s stock is down 58% so far this year. However, 5-star analyst James Ricchiuti, from Needham, doesn’t flinch from Kornit’s recent share price losses. In fact, he rates the stock a Buy, along with a $155 price target. The figure implies shares will be valued ~141% higher in a year’s time. (To watch Ricchiuti’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Ricchiuti writes: “We believe the long-term secular drivers that underpin our positive investment thesis on Kornit are intact... We believe business remains healthy, notwithstanding increased macro uncertainty. We still foresee strong tailwinds in KRNT's business in 2022 and 2023, driven by positive momentum with its largest customers, the growing near-shoring trend and emphasis on sustainability by apparel makers, along with a rich new-product pipeline."" Overall, with 7 recent positive reviews on file, Kornit’s stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating from the Wall Street analyst corps. The shares are selling for $64.19 and their $151.71 average price target implies a one-year upside potential of ~136%. (See KRNT stock analysis on TipRanks) Bill.com Holdings (BILL) The second beaten-down stock we’ll look at is Bill.com, a provider of cloud-based software solutions for the accounting and paperwork issues that threaten to overwhelm the small business world. The company’s cloud platform makes it possible for customers to automate day-to-day processes in billing, invoicing, receiving payments, and making payments, the constant bookkeeping tasks that eat up so much time for small entrepreneurs. Bill.com is popular among its target customer base of small and medium businesses, as evidenced by the company’s strong revenue growth in recent quarters. Earlier this month, the company released its financial results for fiscal 3Q22, and showed powerful year-over-year revenue growth of 179%, to hit a total of $166.9 million for the quarterly top line. Of that total, subscription fees grew 78% to reach $52.2 million, while transaction fees expanded by 286% to reach $113.3 million. Even though the financials were, on the surface, solid, the stock fell by a third after the release. Investors were somewhat spooked by a slowdown in revenue growth. Quarter-over-quarter, the top line expanded only 6.6%, a far cry from the 34% q/q growth in fiscal 2Q22. And looking forward, the company gave fiscal Q4 guidance in the range of $182.3 million to $183.3 million, which even at the high end would be q/q growth of less than 10%. To date this year, the stock is down 51%. Nevertheless, Canaccord’s 5-star analyst Joseph Vafi remains bullish. He writes of this company: “While no one knows the future of the macro right now, we see BILL as being relatively well positioned against the current backdrop, except for its standout valuation, which has clearly already come in materially. With over 70% organic and 179% growth overall in FQ3, no one can say the BILL model does not continue to work on what is a huge, long tail in small businesses that need help with their financial back offices. Also, with 80+% gross margins and a powerful 1-2 punch business model of SaaS subscription and payment volume based revenue, BILL remains the model to beat in SMB payments, in our view."" Along with these upbeat comments, Vafi gives BILL a Buy rating and a $250 price target, implying an upside of ~107% over the next 12 months. (To watch Vafi’s track record, click here) Wall Street would tend to agree with this bullish outlook – as shown by the 12 to 1 breakdown in recent reviews, favoring Buys over Holds and supporting a Strong Buy consensus view. The stock is currently trading at $121 and its 240.83 average target suggests an upside of 99% from that level. (See BILL stock forecast on TipRanks) DermTech (DMTK) Last but not least is DermTech, a leader in the field of molecular dermatology. Specifically, DermTech is developing and commercializing new diagnostic technologies for the early detection of melanoma. This is a common skin cancer, dangerous in itself and made more so by its propensity to metastasize into other areas of the body. Early detection of the disease is the key to successful treatment, and this is where DermTech is stepping in. The company has developed an adhesive patch melanoma test, which can take a non-invasive skin biopsy for medical testing. The company operates its own genetic testing lab where skin samples can be examined. And best of all, the DermTech test can be done by the patient, at home, rather than in a physician’s office. Like the other stocks here, DermTech shows a combination of sound revenues and falling share price. In its 1Q22 report, the company announced a quarterly top line of $3.7 million, up 47% year-over-year. The gain was driven by a 61% increase in assay revenue, which in its own turn was boosted by a 53% y/y increase in billable sample volume, to 14,730 for the quarter. The company did see a quarterly net loss of $1.01 per share – although it ended the quarter with a positive cash holding of $202.1 million. The stock has fallen, however, by 51% so far this year. Analyst Sung Ji Nam, of investment firm BTIG, sees the fall in share price as an opportunity to get in on this stock. ""DMTK remains well-positioned to more than double its revenues in 2022, barring additional significant COVID-related healthcare disruptions in the U.S. for the remainder of the year. Key growth drivers for 2022 and 2023 include the meaningful sales force expansion in 2021 that is expected to drive test volume growth, and DMTK's focus on test ASP improvement through further Medicare segment penetration, appeals management and further expansion of third party payor coverage,"" Ji Nam noted. In line with these bullish comments, Ji Nam sets a Buy rating on the stock and her $38 price target indicates potential for robust growth of ~393% ahead. (To watch Ji Nam's track record, click here) Overall, this small-cap stock has only 4 recent analyst reviews – but they are unanimously bullish, for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $7.71 and have an average price target of $30.33, suggesting a 293% one-year upside potential.

5/11/2022,"There's a bond that pays a 9.62% interest rate and is guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Investors should keep some limitations and conditions in mind before investing, but as inflation has topped 8% since March 2022, this could be an attractive option for the fixed-income portion of your portfolio.

 What Are iBonds? Known as the Series I Savings Bonds, or iBonds for short, the Treasury created them in 1998 as a way to help savers deal with inflation. They come in durations that range from one year to 30 years. This bond has two rates: a fixed rate, which is always zero, and an inflation rate, which is linked to the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The interest earned every six months is added to the value of the bond's principal. Also, in May and November, the Treasury adjusts this bond's inflation rate in line with the latest CPI-U reading. Together the interest rate and the inflation adjustment on the iBonds, which are sold at face value, are called the ""composite rate."" The composite rate on a this kind of bond can never fall below zero, even in the rare event that deflation would otherwise drag a bond's composite rate into negative numbers. Pros of iBonds There are several aspects of these bonds that make them attractive: They currently have one of the highest rates of interest available. From May 2022 through October 2022 these bonds pay 9.62% interest. That's hard to ignore when the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate bond index has paid a negative 9.4% rate so far in 2022. Series I Savings Bonds are not subject to state or local taxes. They have the security of a U.S. government guarantee. Series I Savings Bonds are easy to buy. You can buy up to $10,000 worth of them online. You also can buy an additional $5,000 of paper bonds using your federal income tax refund. Potential Drawbacks of iBonds These bonds carry a few conditions and limitations that may dampen their appeal to some fixed-income investors. For one thing, their future returns can decline since they are pegged to the CPI-U. Only U.S. citizens, legal residents or civilian employees of the U.S. government (regardless of citizenship or residency) may buy iBonds. There's no market for your iBond. Finally, iBonds also carry these deadlines: Within one year of purchase: You cannot cash the bond. Within one year and five years of purchase: You can cash the bond, but you'll forfeit the previous three months' interest payments. This is known as early redemption. Five years or longer: If you want to avoid a penalty, you have to wait at least five years. After 30 years of purchase: The bond ceases to pay interest and so becomes vulnerable to inflation. Why Other High-Yielding Bonds Are Less Attractive (Right Now) A Series I Savings Bond is an exception to the caution currently being voiced by financial experts about other higher-yield bonds. Charles Schwab, for example, says credit spreads, the difference in rates between corporate bonds and government bonds of similar duration, are small. Corporate bonds pay more than government bonds to reward investors for taking the risk of lending to a private enterprise that could default. But currently the difference in rates between the two is still too small to justify buying the higher-yielding corporate bonds. Schwab also notes that corporate profit growth is slowing, citing inflation, supply chain issues and borrowing costs. ""Rising borrowing costs via higher interest payments can eat into corporate profits,"" the firm said. ""Meanwhile, wage gains are good for consumers, but can be a pain point for corporations, as it's another input cost on the rise."" Finally, the yield curve is not looking favorable for high-yield bonds – except iBonds. The yield curve is a curve on a graph that tracks the yield of bonds of various durations. Normally, shorter duration bonds yield less longer duration bonds, and high-yield bond total returns relative to Treasurys have been strongest when the yield curve is steep (long duration bonds paying more than short duration bonds). However, as of May 2022, the yield on 2-year and 10-year government bonds was very close, and in fact the previous month the 2-year actually exceeded the 10-year, which is called an inversion. That strains the profitability of high-yield bond issuers like banks. Bottom Line Series I Savings Bonds are a powerful anchor to windward, financially speaking. They are low-risk savings bonds issued by the U.S. government that pay a very high interest rate. Through October 2022 they were paying a lofty 9.62%. You may purchase these either electronically via TreasuryDirect (up to $10,000) or you can use your IRS tax refund to buy paper Series I bonds (up to $5,000). By combining electronic and paper purchases, you can buy up to $15,000 of Series I bonds each year. Keep in mind that there is no secondary market for them.

5/11/2022,"A series of headwinds have inflamed worries lately, as investors try to find a path through geopolitical turmoil and the threat of recession in the mid-term. Worse are the stubborn inflationary pressures, rising prices that show no signs of slowing down. Taken all together, these factors are straining the economy and have pushed the S&P 500 well into correction territory this year, down by 15% so far. All of this has investors moving heavily into defensive stocks. Watching the market conditions for financial firm Morningstar, manager research analyst Ryan Jackson gets down to the bottom line: “Investors want safety, they want security, and they want to go somewhere where they feel like their money is going to be a little more protected, even in a turbulent environment.” When markets and futures are uncertain, and volatility is high, the logical portfolio move is into high-yield dividend payers. These are the classic defensive plays, giving investors a dual path toward returns, from both the share appreciation and the dividend payments. Bearing this in mind, we used the TipRanks’ database to zero-in on two stocks that are showing high dividend yields – on the order of 8% or more. Each stock also holds a Strong Buy consensus rating; let’s see what makes them so attractive to Wall Street’s analysts. Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) First up is Arbor Realty Trust, a mortgage lender working with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to provide loan funding. The company also offers financing for developers putting up multifamily residences – the type of project that Arbor Realty Trust focuses on. The main part of the company’s business is mortgage lending for apartment projects and commercial properties. Arbor’s business has been solid in recent quarters, and the company beat the EPS forecast in 1Q22 by a wide margin. GAAP EPS came in at 55 cents, compared to the estimate of 45 cents. The company supported that earnings beat with 17% portfolio growth, and $2.83 billion in loan originations. The company’s sound financial results support a high dividend, of 38 cents per common share. This payment, declared early this month, was up 1 cent from the previous quarter, and marked the eighth quarter in a row of sequential dividend increases. The company has bumped up the dividend by 27% over the past two years. At the current level, the dividend payment annualizes to $1.52 and gives a yield of 8.7%. Covering this stock for Piper Sandler, analyst Crispin Love sees plenty of potential for investors to grab onto. He writes: “Given macro uncertainty and volatility in the markets, we are pointing investors to names that can perform best in these uncertain times and we believe Arbor fits the bill given its historical performance, diversified revenue streams, and tailwinds in the multifamily bridge space. Multifamily bridge has been a popular space in recent quarters given strong demand and pristine credit quality and Arbor has a competitive advantage in this space given its history and performance across multiple cycles."" ""While we expect interest rate volatility in 2022 and some pressure to earnings, we believe the dividend is safe given the payout ratio and our expectation that ABR will continue to comfortably cover the dividend with core earnings,” Love added. All of the above makes it clear why Love is now standing with the bulls. The analyst rates ABR an Overweight (i.e. Buy) while his $20 price target implies an upside of ~17% for the year ahead. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~26% potential total return profile. (To watch Love’s track record, click here) Judging by the consensus breakdown, opinions are anything but mixed. With 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that ABR is a Strong Buy. At $21.67, the average price target implies ~28% upside potential from current levels. (See ABR stock forecast on TipRanks) Redwood Trust (RWT) The second dividend stock we’ll look at is Redwood Trust, another name in the long roster of real estate investment trusts (REITs), a class of company known as dividend champions. Redwood works in residential real estate, investing in a combination of mortgage-backed securities, prime jumbo residential loans, and multifamily securities. Those latter are Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae loans backed by the Federal government. During the recent first quarter of 2022, Redwood reported the deployment of $128 million worth of capital in new investments. The company also funded $920 million worth of business purpose loans, and distributed $2.5 billion worth of jumbo residential loans. These activities, combined with past quarters’ ongoing loan activity, generated a GAAP income of 24 cents per diluted share. While down sequentially from 4Q21, the Q1 EPS was nearly triple the year-ago value. That income in 1Q22 was enough – and to spare – to cover the 23-cent regular share dividend declared for the quarter. The payment is the second in a row at this level, but the company has raised the dividend 5 times since the June payment of 2020. At the current rate, the dividend of 23 cents annualizes to 92 cents per common share and gives a strong dividend of 9.1%. In addition, Redwood has been moving to expand its lending portfolio. The most recent such move, in April of this year, was the acquisition agreement with Riverbend Funding. The acquisition adds Riverbend’s private mortgage lending to Redwood’s business purpose mortgage platform. The acquisition, for an undisclosed amount, is expected to close by the middle of this year. In an in-depth review of this stock, 5-star analyst Stephen Laws, from investment firm Raymond James, points out that the company’s earnings missed the estimates – but adds, “Originations remained strong in 1Q, and the Riverbend acquisition expands the business purpose lending platform... We expect RWT to maintain the quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share in 2022 and pay a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share in 2023... We believe shares should trade at a premium to book value given the strength in the operating business, dividend growth, our expectation of continued book value growth, and the internal management structure.” In line with these comments, Laws puts a Strong Buy rating on RWT shares, and backs that with a $16 price target, suggesting an upside of 61% in the next 12 months. (To watch Laws’ track record, click here) Overall, Redwood’s 7 recent analyst reviews break down 7 to 1 in favor of Buys over Holds, giving the stock its Strong Buy consensus rating – and showing that Wall Street is clearly aligned with the bullish view here. The shares are trading for $9.91 and the $13.50 average price target points toward a 36% one-year upside.

5/11/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- There’s a crypto refrain when prices crash precipitously like this: The selloff is washing out the short term-focused non-believers, known as weak hands, strengthening the industry in its wake. Most Read from Bloomberg Marcos Jr. Leads With 61% of Votes Counted: Philippines Update Stocks Sink to 13-Month Low as U.S. Curve Steepens: Markets Wrap Day Trader Army Loses All the Money It Made in Meme-Stock Era Russian Envoy to Poland Hit With Red Paint in War Protest Dictator’s Son Marcos Wins by Landslide in Philippine Vote It’s a glib way to think of all those who had joined the market as Bitcoin’s price rose to an all-time high at the end of last year -- including institutions and small-time at-home investors, many of whom are deeply underwater on their investments now. A measure called MVRV -- which divides market value by the average purchase price -- shows that short-term holders, on average, purchased Bitcoin at around $47,500. Another gauge, called the spent-output-profit ratio (SOPR), indicates those kind of investors are selling at a loss right now, according to an analysis by Genesis Global that uses Glassnode data. And it’s not just those who have held the coin for a few months. More than half of traders who held crypto at the end of 2021 had gotten in that year, crypto-firm Grayscale Investments said at the time. Bitcoin’s average price in 2021 hovered around $47,300. It was near $32,000 on Monday in New York trading. “Absolutely a ton of people are down,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive of FRNT Financial Inc. “Anyone who bought BTC for the first time in 2021 is down.” Crypto fans have long argued that digital assets would hold up well during turbulent times. Many had said Bitcoin would prove to be a good inflation hedge thanks to its limited supply. It was also supposed to hold up better amid economic and geopolitical crises because it’s not tied to any government and has no centralized authority. Instead, digital-asset investors are suffering through an environment that’s put a lot of risky assets through the wringer this year. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are raising interest rates to combat inflation just as the economic backdrop is softening. In this environment, Bitcoin, the largest digital asset by market value, has been cut in half since its November record. It’s seen five straight weeks of declines and just one positive day out of the last 11 sessions, including Monday’s. “Cryptocurrencies are risk assets,” said David Spika, president and chief investment officer of GuideStone Capital Management. “‘This should be a good inflation hedge.’ Wrong. It is a speculative asset that is not going to perform well in an environment like this.” During its downfall, Bitcoin has largely moved in tandem with other riskier assets, analysts have noted. Its correlation to tech stocks has been particularly pronounced, with both the coin and the Nasdaq 100 reaching highs in November. The 90-day correlation coefficient of Bitcoin and the tech gauge now stands above 0.68, the highest such reading in Bloomberg data going back to 2010. A coefficient of 1 means the assets are moving in lockstep, while minus-1 would show they’re moving in opposite directions. “Anyone who bought tech stocks over the past year is underwater, too, and I group them together,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. To be sure, short-term investors aren’t all necessarily retail -- a lot of institutional players also started to dabble in crypto in recent years. Still, the crypto craze had caught the eye of a lot of at-home traders who had been stuck at home during the pandemic and who deployed money into a market that went up in 2020 and 2021. In addition, the average purchase price is just that -- an average -- meaning that Bitcoin reaching that level again doesn’t necessitate all those investors break even once more, said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis. “It’s likely that more will be, since short-term holders are more prone to panic-selling, and so the average purchase price is likely to drop fast,” she said. As to what it would take for Bitcoin to reclaim its old highs is anyones guess. In the meantime, many are projecting that the coin, and other cryptos, will come out on the other end stronger. The shakeout will leave behind long-term HODLers who aren’t scared enough to offload their holdings. Famed investor Marc Cuban thew in his two cents, tweeting that crypto is going through the same lull the early internet went through. Still, the Fed is dead-set on bringing inflation down through a series of interest-rate hikes, and Bitcoin, and other riskier assets, could meander along all year in this tighter-monetary-policy environment. “Bitcoin is under tremendous sell pressure,” said Steven McClurg, CIO at Valkyrie Investments. “Barring an extraordinary event, it wouldn’t surprise me for us touch $25,000 before we start to see some form of stability. That said, we are more likely to see sideways trading through to the fourth quarter than we are to see a rally carry us through the summer.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Major League Soccer Threatens to Replace the NHL as One of the Big Four U.S. Sports China’s Massive Community-Buying Industry Is Collapsing Germany Comes to Grips With Its Hard-Power Role in Europe Business Travel Rebounds as Execs Choose (Real) Face Time Over Zoom Putting an End to Heart Attacks by Editing Human DNA ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•19 hours ago,Bitcoin Washout Is Leaving Mom-and-Pop Buyers Holding the Bag,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-washout-leaving-mom-pop-220000088.html

5/11/2022,"U.S. stocks have had a rough start to the year after a standout 2021—and if history is any guide for what’s to come, things could get even worse from here. The S&P 500, which returned nearly 27% to investors last year, has been dragged down more than 15% year to date by rising interest rates, geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation, and a number of other bearish factors. The big question on most investors’ minds: How much further will stocks drop? Bank of America’s chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett has looked backward, and he has a hibernation outlook. Based on historical bear market trends, he said, there could be months of pain ahead. “In the last 19 bear markets, the average peak to trough decline has been 37% with an average duration of 289 days. If history were to repeat then today’s bear market ends in October 2022 with the S&P at 3000,” Bank of America Research analysts wrote in a Sunday note. If that bears out, it means the S&P 500 still has another roughly 25% downturn ahead of it from current levels. Hartnett noted that in the past 25 years, the NYSE composite has always fallen significantly below its 100-week moving average during bear markets, but this year the index is trading just barely below that level, which could mean more downside lies ahead. While about half of the stocks in tech-heavy Nasdaq are down 50% or more from their peaks, and many speculative assets in the cryptocurrency space have seen sharp drawdowns in recent weeks, Hartnett argues Wall Street will spend much of the year working through an “inflation shock,” a “rates shock,” and a “recession shock” that will lead to negative returns and increased volatility. The “good news is bear markets are quicker than bull markets,” he said. The investment strategist added that while many investors have sought protection in commodities since the start of the year, he believes these holdings should be sold moving forward “given recession risk.” Hartnett isn’t bullish on the tech space, either, arguing that more speculative tech stocks will remain in a bear market for the next two years, even if the S&P 500 bottoms out. A floor does not equal a new bull market for tech stocks, he said. The investment strategist isn’t alone in calling for stocks to fall amid a U.S. recession either. From billionaire investors to top investment banks, recession fears are spreading on Wall Street. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase and one of the most powerful voices in finance, argued there’s only a 33% chance the Federal Reserve can ensure a “soft landing” for the U.S. economy—in which rising inflation is tamed, but a recession is avoided—in an interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday. And Deutsche Bank said in April that it believes a “major” recession will come by 2023. Even former Fed officials have begun sounding the alarm, with former Fed Chair Randal Quarles saying in an interview last week that a recession is likely, “given the intensity of inflation.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com",Business/Fortune•yesterday,"If history repeats itself, the bear market has 6 months of pain ahead, Bank of America’s chief strategist says",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/history-repeats-itself-bear-market-163227152.html
