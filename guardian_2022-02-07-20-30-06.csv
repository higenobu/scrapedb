2/7/2022,"The lunchtime shop-bought sandwich was dealt a heavy blow by Covid, as city centres emptied and trips out were limited. The return to the office and the lifting of lockdown restrictions have propelled it back on to the menu for millions of workers but the cost of living crisis, plus the fact that many people feel they saved a fortune on lunches, snacks and coffees during the pandemic, mean lots of us are looking for ways to make our money go further.  With that in mind, Guardian Money this week carried out a survey of lunchtime meal deals (typically a sandwich or salad, etc, a drink and a snack) from some of the main high street chains. We were keen to find out the answer to these questions: What’s the most you can get for your money if you choose the most expensive items permitted? Which retailer offers the biggest potential saving? And because it’s important to have a lunch to look forward to, how do some of the bestsellers rate taste-wise? The answer to the savings question, according to our (nonscientific) survey, is Tesco, where buying items through its meal deal resulted in paying 55% less for them than getting them separately. (It is possible Boots may be able to beat that as its meal deal is cheaper in most locations outside London.) In monetary terms, Boots was the winner, with a £4.21 saving. Tesco has kept its meal deal pegged at £3 for almost 10 years, during which time most if not all of its rivals have increased the headline cost. For example, Sainsbury’s put up its lunchtime meal deal price from £3 to £3.50 in May 2021 (although it says it is offering more than three times as many choices as it was before the price change). As of 19 January, the government no longer asked people in England to work from home if possible. That prompted millions to head for the office again – and triggered an immediate increase in people buying sandwiches, salads and the like. Meanwhile, the easing of restrictions on travel means more people are grabbing some food from a shop before they catch their train or plane. Waitrose says its sandwich sales leapt 91% during the week beginning Monday 24 January, and that it also saw strong demand for sushi. A spokesperson says the retailer is also noticing a growing trend in people “upgrading” their homemade sandwiches – in terms of what they are putting in them and the bread they are using. Some on tight budgets will have no choice but to continue bringing in their own sandwiches or something in a plastic container. Meanwhile, some would rather hand their cash to an independent sandwich bar or cafe. But many will welcome the opportunity to take a lunchtime stroll and pick up a meal deal from one of the big chains. The maximum saving you can achieve is actually slightly bigger than when Guardian Money last took a close look at pricing almost seven years ago. That was in June 2015, and on that occasion, Boots was the winner with a 53% saving. Of course, some will argue that if individual items are overpriced in the first place, then these deals aren’t nearly as good as they might first appear. What’s not in doubt is that the lunchtime meal industry is a highly competitive sector, which may be helping to keep retailers on their toes. The latest player to muscle in on the market is Amazon, courtesy of the Amazon Fresh food stores it is rolling out. At the one in London’s East End that we visited this week, it was offering a meal deal where, if you bought a main (options included a sandwich, wrap, salad or sushi tray), you could add a snack plus a drink for £1 extra. The range was comparable to what is on offer at other retailers, although perhaps with a few more “high-end” options. Meanwhile, in the last couple of years a lot more vegetarian and vegan mains have been launched – from vegan BLT sandwiches to falafel wraps – plus more healthy snack options such as olives and fruit pots, and items tailored to people on specific diets. However, purely in terms of getting the most bang for your meal deal buck, meat-based sandwiches, subs and wraps typically offer the best value. Look for things such as triple packs of sandwiches and sushi trays. We also found that sandwiches for people on a gluten-free diet were often quite pricey – perhaps £2.80 or £3 – but available as part of a deal. On the drinks front, coconut water and smoothies from companies such as Naked and Innocent are good to grab as part of a meal deal because they can cost £2-£3 each when bought individually. Most people probably reach for crisps as their snack but there are usually higher-priced options such as yoghurt and granola pots or protein bars. So what are the UK’s favourite meal deal items? According to Tesco, they include a chicken, bacon and stuffing sandwich, a 500ml bottle of regular Coca-Cola and a bag of McCoy’s flame grilled steak crisps. Boots says its most popular items are a chicken sandwich, Walkers Max paprika crisps and Coca-Cola. It remains to be seen how supermarkets and other retailers will respond to the latest wave of food and drink price inflation, which was running at more than 4% in December. Crisps and soft drinks – key components of many a meal deal – are two products that have shot up in price. A note on our findings: this was a snapshot survey carried out in various parts of London over two days this week. For each retailer, we visited two outlets. Products on offer and stock availability will vary by location and at different times of the day. Cost of meal deal £3 in all stores. Most expensive combination we could find £6.70: a gluten-free chicken and bacon mayonnaise sandwich (£2.80), Vita Coco coconut water (£2.75) and a Graze lemon flapjack (£1.15). Saving £3.70, or 55%. Observations There are apparently more than 10m possible combinations. These include a good number of items from Tesco’s Plant Chef range, including plant-based takes on traditionally meaty old favourites. Cost of meal deal £3.50 in all its stores (it says prices may vary in some petrol station locations). Most expensive combination we could find £7.40: a deep-filled BLT sandwich (£3), a Ginsters Cornish pasty (£1.50) and a Luhv Skin cold-pressed drink (£2.90). Saving £3.90, or 53%. Observations Top tip: if you buy a Ginsters pasty or slice as your snack today, you could have it tomorrow – thereby sorting out two lunches for the price of one. We were impressed with the Re:Nourish vegan soups range, as they looked classy, with interesting flavours. Students who are Totum or Young Scot cardholders can get a further 10% off. Cost of meal deal £3.39 outside London, £3.99 in London and at airports. Most expensive combination we could find £8.20: a chicken sandwich triple pack (£3.35), a Naked Green Machine drink (£2.60) and a Trek Power choc orange protein bar (£2.25). Saving £4.21 in our test, or 51%. Observations Lots of choice and plenty of vegan options. But in the two shops we visited, it wasn’t always clear which items were included in and excluded from the meal deal, and what they cost individually. Cost of meal deal £3.50 in all stores. Most expensive combination we could find £7.15: a gluten-free cheese and tomato sandwich (£3), an Emmi Mr Big iced coffee (£2.50) and a Nomadic yoghurt and oat clusters with chocolate pot (£1.65). Saving £3.65, or 51%. Observations Hot food, as well as hot drinks, are now included – things such as a southern fried chicken breast fillet or steak and potato slice. Breakfast and bakery items such as croissants, porridge and doughnuts have also been added, making it a meals deal. Cost of meal deal £5 (only available in franchise stores). Most expensive combination we could find £7/£7.40. The reason for the two figures is that one store had space on its shelves for a reduced fat hummus and carrot snack costing £1.55 but there were none left, so we couldn’t buy one and had to choose another snack costing 40p less. We bought a chicken honey mustard pasta salad (£4), a bottle of Coca-Cola (£1.85) and an almond, blueberry and cranberry bar (£1.15). Saving £2/£2.40, or 29%/32%. Observations Lunchtime meal deals are only available in its franchise stores at rail stations, BP garages and in hospitals. You will not find them in M&S’s main outlets – a spokesperson told us the company had not offered lunchtime meal deals in these “for a number of years”. M&S says prawn mayo is still its top-selling sandwich. A bargain lunch and the chance to help the planet are an attractive combination to a Guardian Money editor, so when I noticed that the food waste app Too Good to Go had added lunch to the menu, I was quickly reaching for my debit card. I often find myself in the Pret a Manger near the Guardian office at around 2pm, so when the coffee and sandwich chain popped up on the app last autumn, it seemed too good to be true. The offer that day was £12 worth of hot food for £4 – I booked and paid in the evening and started to look forward to my lunch the next day. Would it be mac and cheese? Maybe a wrap? The prospect of the “magic bag” I had ordered kept me going that morning. It was an unseasonably warm day, so no one was buying soup. I wouldn’t have bought soup given the choice. I wen to pick up my bag and headed back to the office. In it, I discovered three pots of soup – all different flavours – and two warm croissants, one with cheese and tomato and one with ham. It wasn’t what I’d have selected but pleased several colleagues and seemed reasonable value. Last week I thought I’d try the app again – it was more like soup weather, and I was back in the office after several weeks eating fairly boring cheese sandwiches at home. I went to Pret and paid the same and got three pots of soup – all chicken and rice. And that was it. It was very pleasant soup – the colleagues I gave the other two pots to agreed – but I’d say that, for me, it added up to a false economy. I asked other people if they’d used Too Good to Go for lunch. Several reported having had better luck than me – lunch boxes from independent cafes for £2.50, good salads from Chop’d. The best buys seemed to be food picked up at the end of the day and eaten the next, rather than the lunchtime offers. One person said they had picked up a Costa bag one Sunday and been living off the tuna melts ever since after freezing them. Near home and work there are a handful of outlets offering collection around lunchtime, including independent bakeries as well as some chains. The choice is much broader if you are able to collect at the end of the day, and it seems like you get a better selection of food. If you’re up for a lunchtime lottery – and have colleagues who like soup – the app is well worth a punt.

2/7/2022,"The Manchester City manager, Gareth Taylor, said his team deserved a point from Sunday’s 1-0 defeat to Chelsea. Perhaps they did and had Chelsea conceded there would have been few complaints with the final outcome. However, while City upped the ante in the later stages the home team did not at any point look rattled. This was a controlled Chelsea performance. One which denied potent wingers Lauren Hemp and Jess Park room and stopped the final pass reaching Khadija Shaw and, later, her replacement Ellen White. “I think we were diligent out of possession. Our defensive strategy was brilliant,” said Emma Hayes. “Our ability in the first half to take Man City to the spaces we wanted them to be in worked really, really well. Second half I made a change in terms of where I wanted them to go. I didn’t want [Alex] Greenwood on the ball as much.” Yes, City had spells of control, but these were managed spells, with Chelsea almost urging the visitors to come at them.

They fired Jean-Luc Vasseur last week, the second manager to be shown the door this season. And by exiling the former Lyon man they have probably ended any chance of success. Whoever is brought in – the former Scotland manager Shelley Kerr is among the rumoured replacements – to fill his shoes will not have enough time to bed in before the end of the season. They are 19 points off the top of the table and 14 outside of Champions League qualification spots.

Anyway, here’s Manchester United’s Alessia Russo. The attacker has scored four goals this season and they’ve all come against the big teams – Chelsea, Arsenal (twice) and Manchester City. So, when her team faced off against the league leaders Arsenal on Saturday, it came as no surprise she got her side’s goal. Russo was a menace to deal with from the onset, especially for Arsenal’s left-sided defender Katie McCabe, who was faced the full brunt of the United forward’s prowess and was eventually sent off for two yellow card offences. Russo nodded United ahead from Katie Zelem’s pinpoint corner for the opener – a set-piece move that their manager, Marc Skinner, called “brilliant”. Arsenal equalised late in the game through Stina Blackstenius but Russo’s efforts meant the leaders dropped two crucial points in the title run-in.

But those discussions have stopped and for good reason. Hope Powell’s side lost 4-0 to Tottenham on Sunday, extending their winless run to seven league matches for the first time. They have scored just one goal in that period. “We were below par even though we had a lot of the ball,” Powell said after the latest defeat. “We didn’t create enough. The goals were disappointing. If you become easy to beat, you’re going to lose the game.” She is not wrong. Spurs, on the other hand, continue to push for the third Champions League spot and are just a point behind Manchester United. SR Emma Hayes and Gareth Taylor call for expansion of WSL A disastrous afternoon for Birmingham City may have gone a long way towards sealing their relegation fate as Leicester, the team they lost to, are now five points above them at the foot of the table. Birmingham were the architects of their own demise as goalkeeper Emily Ramsey was shown a red card in the 26th minute for bringing down Jess Sigsworth. It had been a fairly even match until that point but Sigsworth scored the resulting penalty and Leicester went on to win the game 2-1. It’ll be a tough task for Birmingham to stay up now with Leicester finding form. Last season the Blues ended with 14 points from 22 matches (0.64 points per game) to narrowly avoid relegation. This time around they have four from 14 games (0.29). It is not looking good.

It wasn’t the prettiest strike, with Villa’s keeper Hannah Hampton bundling the ball to the floor after a corner. A flurry of players tried to gain possession but Stringer got the decisive touch. It is a fine line between hero and villain though and Stringer nearly got sent off.

2/7/2022,"To this day, only footsoldiers have paid a price for the riot at the Capitol last January 6th. Politicians who spurred them on, praised them afterwards, and now incite further hatred with hallucinatory talk of “political prisoners” have remained smugly immune. This could change in one case: Republican Congressman Madison Cawthorn, who was on the mall that fateful day, implored Trumpists to “fight,” and is now seeking re-election in North Carolina. His candidacy is being challenged on the basis of the 14th Amendment. Passed after the Civil War, it disqualifies from holding office anyone who has sworn allegiance to the Constitution and then engages in insurrection.  Other democracies are comfortable not just with restricting individual rights to run for office, but with banning entire parties suspected of undermining democracy. Americans, by contrast, have been inclined to leave things to sort themselves out in the political process. But here drastic measures are justified: citizens in a democracy have to accept being governed by politicians they disagree with; they don’t have to put up with politicians who start insurrections when things don’t go their way. Disqualification could have a salutary effect on the Republican Party as such; and it might provide a model for banning Trump from holding office again – something that was on the table during the 2021 impeachment and endorsed by seven Republican senators at the time. In North Carolina, citizens can challenge a candidate to prove they meet qualifications for Congress. Unlike the House Committee investigating the events of January 6th, the board on elections could force a sitting member of Congress to testify about the role he played before, during, and after the insurrection. In the end, his fate could resemble that of many Confederates after the Civil War: not necessarily criminal punishment, but exclusion from exercising power. Many American constitutional lawyers feel ambivalent about an approach known elsewhere as “militant democracy”: measures to restrict the rights of people posing a threat to democracy but who have – unlike terrorists, for instance – not done anything criminal. Courts in Germany, Spain, and South Korea ban entire political parties; in the US, even at the height of McCarthyism, the Communist Party was not prohibited. Why, skeptics might ask, not have faith in politics instead of democracies doing something that looks pretty undemocratic? After all, if the people themselves are not able to see dangers to democracy for what they are, democracy might be lost anyway. That’s not where worries stop. If you go down the path of prohibitions, for example, what would prevent Republicans from McCarthy-style retaliation against figures like AOC? After all, they could argue, she’s a socialist, capitalism’s the American way, and hence she’s obviously engaged in overthrowing our political system. This is not paranoia: in Indiana, Republicans are pushing a school bill which would declare socialism incompatible with the principles on which the US was founded. As a matter of principle, it seems inconsistent to oppose felon disenfranchisement and yet demand rights restrictions for office-seekers. People ought to be punished for actual criminal behavior, but why also deny them a role in our process of self-government? After all, no democracy should create situations where some people look like second-class citizens not enjoying full use of political freedoms. Such worries must be taken seriously. A democracy that is trigger-happy about taking individuals or entire groups out of the political game is probably not as democratic as it sees itself to begin with. (In Europe, for example, Turkey holds the record in party bans – and these bans have often been aimed at legitimate advocates for the Kurdish minority.) But ultimately these worries do not weaken the case for disqualifying pro-insurrectionist Republicans. Constitutional requirements are not something that can be dispensed with ad hoc: you either meet the age, residency, and citizenship requirements for Congress or you don’t. What matters is that the process ascertaining what Cawthorn said and did is fair. True, anyone disqualified will style themselves a martyr – further proof of Democrats’ tyranny! They will wallow in the culture of victimhood which, in a typical form of projection, the far right always attributes to left-wing proponents of identity politics. Of course, the far right itself relentlessly pushes people to indulge the fantasy of being a persecuted minority: as a result, insurrectionists do not regard themselves as aggressors at all, but as merely engaged in self-defense and saving the Republic. Since this game is being played no matter what, there are hardly prudential considerations to go easy on pro-insurrection politicians. Plus, if disqualified figures feel that a great injustice was done, they can appeal to Congress, which, with a “two-thirds majority in each House,” can decide to lift restrictions, for instance if politicians stop lying that January 6th was a tourist outing for patriots. Unlike in the case of so many felons, this not a political life sentence. Of course, there is always a predictable chorus of pundits and politicians lamenting that all this will further “deepen our divisions.” But they should ask themselves whether such disqualifications and demarcations are not the kind of thing that a normal center-right party would not undertake itself: because the Republican Party has become a Trump personality cult, it might actually be in the interest of those too afraid to speak out against the cult to outsource the necessary boundary-drawing to what Cawthorn himself dismisses as “state bureaucrats.” After all, to paraphrase Lyndon Johnson, even strident left-wingers have an interest in a democratic rightwing party that is inside the tent pissing out rather than an anti-democratic, violence-prone one pissing in. Those crying that disqualifications re-open political wounds and delay national “healing” – often a demand pushed by rightwingers to distract from their complicity in the assault on the Capitol – have to realize that the issue will not go away. Other figures will be challenged as well, and, of course, Trump himself, if he tries to get on state ballots in 2024. Whether a heavily right-leaning US supreme court will uphold disqualifications is a very open question indeed – but there is every reason to try enforcing them.

2/7/2022,"Olivia Colman has been named actress of the year by the London Critics’ Circle film awards for her lead role in the Elena Ferrante adaptation The Lost Daughter, in sharp contrast to the Bafta film awards’ failure to nominate her for its equivalent prize. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, The Lost Daughter is about an academic (played by Colman) on holiday in Greece who becomes involved with another family when their young daughter goes missing. Colman has already been nominated for a string of awards for the role, including the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild, and is expected to be nominated for the best actress Oscar when they are announced on Tuesday.  Jane Campion’s western The Power of the Dog, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst, is also emerging as an awards-season powerhouse, and came away with four prizes from the London Critics’: film of the year, director of the year for Campion, actor of the year for Cumberbatch, and supporting actor of the year for Kodi Smit-McPhee.

2/7/2022,"While former Miami Dolphin Coach Brian Flores’ lawsuits against the NFL dominate the news, his story is an old one that’s as American as football. The former coach’s allegations of league-wide racial discrimination and team interviews with minority candidates conducted in bad faith, sets the NFL’s nearly 20-year-old Rooney Rule – which was adopted in 2002 to address the virtual exclusion of minorities from leadership roles – in stark relief. The rule requires teams to interview minority candidates for coaching and other front-office jobs. However, in the nearly 20 years since the rule was conceived, the number of Black coaches increased from one in a single season to a high of eight in 2011, but today again stands at one.  Such is the history of a league, and a country, for which two steps forward and two steps back, is a well-choreographed dance. It evokes the short-lived racial progress during Reconstruction following the Civil War, and then the century-long backlash in the form of lynching, voter suppression through literacy tests and poll taxes and other flagrantly discriminatory laws targeting Blacks. The same fits and starts continue to zig-zag through history, seen more recently in the election of Barack Obama followed by the rise of Donald Trump and white nationalism and current efforts to curtail the minority vote and the teaching of the nation’s fraught racial history. The NFL is merely a microcosm of America. “Victories are hard won and defeats happen overnight,” says Cyrus Mehri, the civil rights lawyer who in 2002, along with the late Johnnie Cochran, conceived the Rooney Rule after back-to-back firings of two Black coaches with winning records. The coaches, Dennis Green of the Minnesota Vikings and Tony Dungy of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, had been among the five African American head coaches in the league’s entire eighty-year history. Their firings – the second reported on the Martin Luther King holiday in 2002 – inspired the lawyers to commission a study of the win and loss records of NFL coaches by race over the course of 15 years. Their report, Black Coaches in the National Football League: Superior Performance, Inferior Opportunities, found that year after year qualified Blacks were overlooked for coaching opportunities and that the handful who were hired were more likely to inherit underachieving teams. Black coaches were also more likely to be fired than white coaches with inferior records. The numbers revealed that Black coaches, on average, won more games per season and led their teams to the playoffs 67% of the time, compared to 39% for white coaches. “The cruel counterpart to the superior performance of black coaches in the NFL is inferior hiring opportunities,” it said. The report findings in a league whose players were nearly 70% Black, but that had not hired its first Black coach until 1989, were hard to ignore. In December 2002, the league’s 32 teams, led by Pittsburgh Steelers President Dan Rooney, unanimously adopted a rule requiring the consideration of minorities for leadership roles. The so-called Rooney Rule initially held promise and was credited with moving the needle in a league long resistant to change. But nearly two decades later hope for many has faded to disillusionment. Although many critics say the Rooney Rule has failed diversity, Mehri believes the NFL has failed the rule by neglecting to consistently enforce it. In 2003 the NFL initially signaled to teams that the rule was to be taken seriously when it levied a $200,000 fine – the largest in NFL history – against the Detroit Lions for hiring a white coach without interviewing minority candidates. But over time, suspicions of sham interviews of minority candidates mounted, culminating in 2018 when Mehri says the Oakland Raiders’ flagrant violation of the rule went unpunished – causing one of its pillars to collapse. The NFL denied the rule had been violated but agreed to close some of the loopholes by requiring teams to only interview minority candidates with the requisite experience for the job. Mehri still sees the league’s failure to enforce in 2018 as a turning point. “It was a missed opportunity,” insists Mehri. “You either enforce it or you destroy it.” History shows that the effectiveness of any measure aimed at racial progress is commensurate with demonstrated commitment to the cause. And without leadership, oversight, and enforcement any hard-won gains can be swiftly erased.

2/7/2022,"Good morning. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, believes he can deliver “a historic solution” to the Ukraine crisis ahead of his arrival in Moscow for talks with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.  After a flurry of diplomatic activity that included talks with the US president, Joe Biden, this weekend and three phone calls with Putin, Macron will land in Moscow on Monday seeking a “de-escalation” of the tense standoff on Ukraine’s eastern borders. Russia has denied planning to invade Ukraine but has tens of thousands of troops near its neighbour’s borders, prompting the US to order about 3,000 extra troops to bolster Nato’s eastern flank in Poland and Romania. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Sunday that an invasion could take place “as soon as tomorrow”. Why does Sullivan believe this? The White House believes Moscow has assembled at least 70% of the firepower it needs to give Vladimir Putin the option of a major military operation by mid-February. What else is planned for today? While Macron is in Moscow, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will be in Washington for talks with Biden, aiming to narrow differences between the US and German approach to the crisis. What has Germany done differently? The German government has refused to act on Kyiv’s calls for arms and has been vague over the future of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. Donald Trump’s incendiary call at a Texas rally for his backers to ready massive protests against “radical, vicious, racist prosecutors” could constitute obstruction of justice or other crimes and backfire legally on Trump, say former federal prosecutors. Trump’s barbed attack was seen as carping against separate federal and state investigations into his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results and his real estate empire. Trump’s rant that his followers should launch the “biggest protests” ever in three cities should prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal” by criminally charging him for his efforts to overturn Biden’s 2020 victory, or for business tax fraud, came at a 30 January rally in Texas where he repeated falsehoods that the election was rigged. Legal experts were astonished at Trump’s strong hints that he would pardon many of those charged for attacking the Capitol on 6 January last year in hopes of thwarting Biden’s certification by Congress if he runs and wins a second term in 2024. Spotify’s chief executive officer Daniel Ek says he “strongly” condemns racial slurs and other comments made by popular US podcaster Joe Rogan, but will not be removing him from the platform. Ek’s comments, sent in a letter to staff seen by Reuters, come on the heels of Rogan issuing an apology for the second time in a week, the latest for using racial slurs after a montage video surfaced showing him repeatedly using the N-word. Ek said it was Rogan’s decision to remove a number of past episodes from The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, following discussions with the music streaming platform and his own reflections on some of the content in the show, including the usage of racially insensitive language. Ek reiterated his stand on Spotify’s content moderation policies and said that he believes the company should have clear boundaries around the content being published. The company should take actions when they are crossed, but he cautioned that cancelling voices is a slippery slope. What else did he say? “While I strongly condemn what Joe has said ... I want to make one point very clear – I do not believe that silencing Joe is the answer,” he said. Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai has given her first interview to an independent media organisation since she alleged on Weibo that a senior Chinese official had coerced her into sex, saying it was an “enormous misunderstanding”. The tennis star was accompanied by a Chinese official who also acted as translator. Navy officials on Sunday identified a Seal candidate who died after an intense training session known as Hell Week, and promised to investigate the episode that left a second sailor in hospital. Kyle Mullen, 24, of New Jersey, died in hospital on Friday night, the officials said, giving no cause of death. Scientists and politicians “probably killed hundreds of thousands of people” by damaging the reputation of the AstraZeneca vaccine, according to an Oxford scientist who worked on the jab. Prof John Bell said: “They have damaged the reputation of the vaccine in a way that echoes around the rest of the world.” The mayor of Canada’s capital declared a state of emergency on Sunday and a former US ambassador to Canada said groups in the US must stop interfering in the domestic affairs of America’s neighbour as protesters opposed to Covid-19 restrictions continued to paralyse Ottawa’s downtown. The number of Americans dying while homeless has surged dramatically in the past five years, an exclusive analysis by the Guardian in conjunction with an academic expert at the University of Washington has shown. An examination of 20 US urban areas found the number of deaths among people living without housing shot up by 77% in the five years ending in 2020. Untreated disease, violence, exposure, overdoses and car strikes are all added hazards of living on the streets. Huddled together on foldout chairs, facing down a table laden with muffins, pretzels and a stuffed toy pig are members of Kutztown’s Banned Book Club, which meets every two weeks to read and discuss literature that conservatives across the country are working to ban from school libraries. The book club members, all aged between 13 and 16, are gathered at a time of crisis. In the past year the book-banning movement has already seen works that mostly address race or LGBTQ issues removed from libraries in Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wyoming and Pennsylvania. The supply chain crisis over the last year has caused quite a splash for the book publishing industry – literally. In early January, a large shipping vessel coming from Taiwan was stalled in the mid-Atlantic, its arrival into the port of New York delayed by port congestion. Intemperate weather – huge waves and powerful ocean winds – knocked 60 containers overboard. Another 89 containers were damaged as the ship rolled in the waves. Containers full of books at the bottom of the ocean are just one problem for an industry facing a host of shortages More than a third of the American population is currently experiencing rapid, above-average rates of temperature increase, with 499 counties already breaching 1.5C (2.7F) of heating, a Guardian review of climate data shows. The US as a whole has heated up over the past century due to the release of planet-warming gases from burning fossil fuels but though the climate crisis is convulsing the US, it is doing so unevenly. Hotspots of extreme warming have emerged. The Chinese streaming platform Tencent Video has restored the original ending to the film Fight Club after it amended the Chinese edition to tell viewers police had “rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals”, prompting a widespread backlash. The wholesale reversal of the anti-capitalist, anarchist denouement to the 1999 hit film, which stars Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter, made international headlines last month.

2/7/2022,"After a difficult day at work in February 2009, Stefan went to a popular gay bar in London with a friend. “It was around the time of the economic crisis and I was a junior lawyer. We’d just had to let lots of new recruits go,” he says. While there, he spotted a “cute guy” in the smoking area. “I really liked the look of him and asked my friend to give him my number,” he says. It wasn’t the first time the two men had seen each other. Sebastien, who had been working in financial services in London since 2006, had spotted Stefan on a night out two years earlier. “I was so shy and just coming out at the time, so I didn’t speak to him,” he says. “I remembered him instantly, though, and told the friend I was with that he was ‘the man of my life’.” Sebastien still felt too shy to approach Stefan, so he was delighted when his friend passed on the phone number. “My cheeks flushed and I was so excited,” he says. “I sent him a text the next day. It took me ages to write because I didn’t want to mess it up.”  They went on a date that Friday night to a French bar, followed by a Spanish restaurant. “Sebastien is French and it was his favourite bar,” says Stefan. “We hit it off straight away. We had the same interests, the same values and the same taste in music.” Although Sebastien was “too nervous” to eat much on the date, he was pleased when Stefan offered to finish his leftovers. “It meant he enjoyed his food as much as me,” he laughs. He was also impressed by all the travelling that Stefan had done. “I had always wanted to discover the world. When I told him I was thinking about leaving London to go travelling, he said: ‘I’ll go with you.’” Over the next few weeks, they continued to enjoy date nights and soon became a couple. In 2011, they moved into a shared flat in Acton, west London. “We started doing small trips to Europe, but knew we wanted more,” says Stefan. After a trip to Thailand in 2012 to get diving certificates, it became clear to them both that a gap year was on the cards. They began saving and by 2014 they were ready to quit their jobs and leave the country. “We started with the Trans-Siberian railway through Russia and spent almost two years travelling across Asia,” says Stefan. They set up a blog called Nomadic Boys to document their travels, which has become a full-time job for both of them. “When we started out, we wondered whether there might be an issue with any countries that have anti-gay laws. We were very careful,” says Stefan. “But after a while, we began to relax and we were welcomed by gay communities everywhere.” They married in 2018 in Ealing, west London, with plans for a bigger wedding celebration in 2020, but the pandemic put that on hold, as well as their travels. The couple settled temporarily in Cyprus, where Stefan has family. “We are so used to being with each other in confined spaces that the lockdowns weren’t too much of a challenge,” he says. This year, they hope to travel again, starting with Iceland and South Africa. “I’ve been with Seb for 13 years and he always finds a way to make me burst out laughing,” says Stefan. “Every day is different and it’s always exciting. He fills me with joy when I’m with him and I feel like I’m at my greatest as a person.” Sebastien appreciates his partner’s honesty and positivity. “He would never lie or say anything bad and he’s the sweetest person you will ever meet,” he says. “I’ll be thinking about what could go wrong and he’ll always be looking at how to make it better. That’s what I love about him.” Want to share your story?

2/7/2022,"Gennaro Fabbri had a plan. He would stop selling chairs and find a small shop with a vinaia (wine cellar) that could be converted into a distillery for the production of liquori and syrups. He found what he was looking for in the main piazza of a small town called Portomaggiore in the province of Ferrara, in Emilia-Romagna. Helped by a loan from his brother, Antonio, Gennaro made the necessary alterations to the old grocery shop and gave it a new name, Premiata Distilleria G Fabbri. The year was 1905. One of the first products was a liqueur called 1° Maggio, named for 1 May, Labour Day. The yellow liquer came in a flask-like bottle labelled with an picture of two workers shaking hands, beside them a sickle and a hammer, and behind them the rising sun. 1° Maggio was a well-priced, everyman’s drink celebrating the dawn of a new century. It was followed by an amaro called Carducci and, soon after that, Virov, a yolk-yellow zabaione-like drink made from egg and marsala. Success was swift and, by the early 1920s, Gennaro had taken on a small factory in Bologna.  Rachele Buriani was, by all accounts, every bit as visionary as her husband, Gennaro. It’s a good story: Rachele picked wild sour cherries called amarena that grew in orchards near Bologna, cooked them in copper pans with sugar until sciroppate (meaning “cooked in syrup”), then persuaded her husband that the future was cherries on a larger scale. It’s a neat origin story for Fabbri, too (the distillery was already well established, but never let a date get in the way of a good story). The couple shared a vision to make products with a broad and democratic appeal, and with a dynamic aesthetic that stood out. Virov, for example, came with a set of matching yellow cups that provided a playful way to serve the drink and served as a reminder never to be without a bottle. And all this at a time when the futurist movement, with its themes of motion, speed and technology, had momentum. Rachele and Gennaro were no doubt in tune with the new interpretations and explosive energy in sculpture, painting, music and architecture, ceramics and gastronomy. The futurist sculptor and ceramicist Riccardo Gatti was commissioned to design the curved, blue-and-white jar for what would become Fabbri’s signature product: deep-purple amarena cherries in syrup that give you ruby lips. The Fabbri story continues, wonderfully, with a pirate and gelato and five generations. But I am going to stop here, with the jar of cherries sitting on the shelf. And, of course, you can use any cherries in syrup for this week’s recipe, which is a combination of Elizabeth David’s flourless chocolate cake, a torta caprese, Margot Henderson’s brownies and a black forest gateau. Keep all these in mind when you bake (cautiously); it should have a creped top and fudge-like heart. Rachele, Gennaro and Riccardo Gatti got it right. They created a jar that serves many purposes: it contains the cherries, it’s lovely to serve from and it’s such a beautiful object that you can’t possibly throw it away, so it becomes part of your life as a decoration, vase or pencil pot, forever hinting that another pot of cherries would be nice. The cake is also nice. So nice, in fact, that if all else fails, I might find a small shop with a wine cellar that could be converted into a bakery.

2/7/2022,"Paul Collingwood has been appointed the interim head coach for England’s forthcoming three-Test tour of West Indies. Collingwood, who took charge of England’s squad for their T20 series in the Caribbean last month, takes over on a temporary basis from Chris Silverwood, who was sacked last week following England’s dismal 4-0 defeat in the Ashes.  “I am genuinely excited to be leading the Test team for the tour of the Caribbean. I can’t wait to get started,” said Collingwood. “Having a challenging Test series against the West Indies straight off the back of the Ashes disappointment gives us a chance from now to reset and rebuild. “Playing Test matches for England is the highest accolade in the game. My objective is to give players clarity, direction and encouragement for them to start building something special.” The squad for the West Indies tour is set to be named on Tuesday, with England still reeling from their chastening experience in Australia. Silverwood, the batting coach Graham Thorpe and the England team director Ashley Giles have all departed in the aftermath, though Joe Root has remained as captain and Collingwood will provide some coaching continuity. “I have spoken to Joe Root and Ben Stokes, and both are excited and passionate to take the team forward in this new cycle,” said Collingwood. “Although they know it won’t be easy, they have the desire and bravery to do things differently to ensure the team can prosper. We have an opportunity to get back on track.”",Sport/Sport,Paul Collingwood appointed England interim head coach for West Indies tour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/paul-collingwood-appointed-england-interim-head-coach-for-west-indies-tour
2/7/2022,"An Ode to Himself Where dost thou careless lie,Buried in ease and sloth?Knowledge that sleeps doth die;And this security,It is the common mothThat eats on wits and arts, and oft destroys them both.  Are all th’ Aonian springsDried up? lies Thespia waste?Doth Clarius’ harp want strings,That not a nymph now sings?Or droop they as disgrac’d,To see their seats and bowers by chatt’ring pies defac’d? If hence thy silence be,As ’tis too just a cause,Let this thought quicken thee:Minds that are great and freeShould not on fortune pause;’Tis crown enough to virtue still, her own applause. What though the greedy fryBe taken with false baitesOf worded balladry,And think it poesy?They die with their conceits,And only piteous scorn upon their folly waits. Then take in hand thy lyre,Strike in thy proper strain,With Japhet’s line aspireSol’s chariot for new fire,To give the world again;Who aided him will thee, the issue of Jove’s brain. And since our dainty ageCannot endure reproof,Make not thyself a pageTo that strumpet, the stage,But sing high and aloof,Safe from the wolf’s black jaw and the dull ass’s hoof. Ben Jonson wrote two odes to himself, both of them expanded varieties of the Horatian ode, and both declaring his disenchantment with the theatre. I’ve chosen the succinct and elegant An Ode to Himself, but the other poem, Ode to Himself (“Come leave the loathed stage”) is very much worth a look. It’s thought to have been occasioned by the failure of his play The New Inn in 1629. I haven’t been able to find a composition date for An Ode to Himself. It could be a more polished, less vitriolic response to the same disappointment, but isn’t necessarily. Notwithstanding the success of his humours-inspired comedy writing, Jonson suffered various setbacks during his theatrical career. For example, he completed Thomas Nashe’s unfinished satire The Isle of Dogs, only to see the play suppressed for al­leged sedition, and to receive a short jail sentence (a case of the “dainty age” being unable to “endure reproof”, perhaps). His tragedies were criticised for being overly reliant on classical models, and he was ridiculed for collecting and publishing the plays as “Workes”. While Jonson’s odes seem clearly to express intense personal sentiments, neither should be read as a permanent valediction to the stage. Despite the focus on poetry and criticism in later life, Jonson wrote four more plays, performed during the reign of Charles I. Two unfinished scripts were found among his papers at his death. The first stanza of An Ode to Himself considers the wider implications of succumbing to “ease and sloth”: “Knowledge that sleeps doth die”. It doesn’t seem that his failure has plunged the speaker into depression, or not admittedly, but that he understands his continued stubborn “security” (confidence) in his own worth will be a threat if it allows stasis. And so in the next stanza he rhetorically questions the extinction of his sources of inspiration, referring to Aonia and Thespia, places associated with the muses, and to Clarius, site of the temple of Apollo. The “chatt’ring pies” originate from the myth in which the nine daughters of King Pierus are turned into magpies for daring to challenge the nine muses. Jonson awards himself the realms of tragedy (Thespia) as well as those of poetry and music. His Ode continues on its gracefully majestic path of self-encouragement, pausing only to demote the youthful competitors, the “greedy fry”, flattered by the false praise of their inferior work. Japhet (stanza 5) is Prometheus, and the “issue of Jove’s brain”, Minerva. With both wisdom and the fire of inspiration, how can the author fail? The last stanza suggests that it’s the response to the satirical writing that has prompted his disappointment, and that his wish is to attain a “higher”, non-worldly form of artistic expression. It’s fortunate that his talent overcame the prescription. While his tragedies are now generally forgotten, his verse still sings, insured against the critical wolves and asses by its human warmth as well as its formal excellence.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: An Ode to Himself by Ben Jonson,https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/feb/07/poem-of-the-week-an-ode-to-himself-by-ben-jonson
2/7/2022,"The government is facing a legal challenge over its newly updated shooting licences for England, which classify game birds as livestock and so allow wild birds to be shot to protect them. Campaigners have said the licences give an unfair advantage to gamekeepers, as they allow the birds to be defined as livestock when shooters want to kill other birds to protect them, but are otherwise considered wild birds so the estate owners are not liable for any damage the game birds cause.  This year, Natural England declared that when receiving any food and shelter from landowners, birds such as pheasant and partridge count as livestock. They now give explicit permission for shooters to kill carrion crows, jackdaws, magpies and rooks to protect the game birds. General licences give broad permissions to shoot certain species of wild birds to protect livestock, aid conservation, and preserve health and public safety. They are permissive licences, meaning users do not need to apply for them but they must comply with their terms and conditions when undertaking licensed acts. Wild Justice, the campaign group run by Mark Avery, Chris Packham and Dr Ruth Tingay, has started a legal challenge against this clarification of the rules. It claims the new definition of livestock is unlawful as it is significantly wider than that used in the Wildlife and Countryside Act. The licence says: “‘Livestock’ is as defined in section 27(1) of the 1981 Act). For the purpose of this licence, this expression also includes gamebirds kept in an enclosure or which are free roaming but remain significantly dependent on the provision of food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival. This does not include supplementary feeding.” But Section 27(1) Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (the “1981 Act”) defines “livestock” as any animal that is kept: “(a) for the provision of food, wool, skins or fur;(b) for the purpose of its use in the carrying on of any agricultural activity; or(c) for the provision or improvement of shooting or fishing;” Its legal letter to Defra says: “Accordingly (as seen by the word ‘also’), footnote 7 seeks to apply – for the purposes of GL42 – a definition of ‘livestock’ which is wider than that defined in section 27(1) of the 1981 Act.” Wild Justice added: “We are unaware of evidence that the species listed on the general licence do cause serious damage to gamebirds at this stage of their lives. Any damage should be capable of being reduced by netting release pens. “If, extremely rarely, any such damage occurs, then lethal control is obtainable through application for a specific licence.” This group has previously brought successful challenges against the legislation and in 2019 managed to get it suspended. Wild Justice has since managed to secure changes including removing all gull species, and the places the licences can be used no longer include sites of special scientific interest and other nature reserves. Wild Justice said: “Any licence authorising killing of wildlife should be clear about when it can be used. Defra’s general licence 42 fails that test. In any case, why is Defra fiddling with definitions of livestock while wildlife declines?”",News/Environment,Ministers face legal challenge over rules for shooting wild birds,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/07/ministers-face-legal-challenge-over-rules-for-shooting-wild-birds-licences
2/7/2022,"UK house prices reached a record high in January according to Halifax, but the lender warned growth is likely to slow “considerably” this year as household finances come under increasing pressure. The price of the average UK home reached a record high of £276,759 in January, up £24,500 over the year, and £37,500 higher than two years ago. However, house price growth slowed to just 0.3% in January, the smallest monthly increase since June last year, in a sign that the pandemic-fuelled boom could be fading.  “While the limited supply of new housing stock to the market will continue to provide some support to house prices, it remains likely that the rate of house price growth will slow considerably over the next year,” said Russell Galley, a managing director at Halifax. Halifax, which has previously said that the housing market “defied expectations” last year, said affordability remains at historically low levels as price rises continue to outstrip growth in earnings. Last week, the Bank of England raised interest rates for the second time in three months, as it sought to temper inflation, which is running at a 30-year high of 5.4%, with analysts expecting further rises later this year. Homeowners are also facing a dramatic increase in living costs, including higher energy and food bills, rising phone and broadband charges, and increased national insurance payments from April. “This situation is expected to become more acute in the short term as household budgets face even greater pressure from an increase in the cost of living and rising interest rates begin to feed through to mortgage rates,” said Galley. “Despite record levels of first-time buyers stepping on to the ladder last year, younger generations still face significant barriers to homeownership as deposit requirements remain challenging.” In the final four months of last year house price growth ran at more than 1% each month, before January’s dip, said Halifax. House prices remain 9.7% up in average compared with January last year. “Deposits will be key to the level of house price inflation this year,” said Anthony Codling, the chief executive of the property data site Twindig. “Those with a big deposit will be able to rise above the living and mortgage cost rises, those without will not unfortunately. The deposit poor will also find it harder to save as living costs rise.” Halifax said Wales had the strongest start to the year of any nation or region, with annual house price inflation of 13.9% compared with last January, to an average of £205,253. Northern Ireland house prices rose by an average of 10.2% to £170,982, while Scotland was up 8.9% year on year to £192,698, a dip on December. In England, the north-west was once again the best-performing region, up 12% year on year to £213,200, with the second highest annual growth rate in the UK. London remains the weakest-performing region with annual growth of 4.5% in January, a third monthly increase double the rate recorded in December and the strongest performance in a year. The annual rate of growth in average UK house prices was unchanged in January at 9.7%.",Lifestyle/Money,UK house prices reach new record but cost of living crisis threatens growth,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/07/uk-house-prices-reach-new-record-but-cost-of-living-crisis-threatens-growth
