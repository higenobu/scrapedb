12/10/2021,"Chicago’s police department is reportedly telling its commanders to familiarize themselves with a plan to shut down the city’s central business district ahead of potential unrest this weekend. The drastic measure -- mentioned in a new internal memo circulating amongst staff -- is just an option on the table at this point, according to WLS. Last weekend, violence plagued Chicago’s Loop neighborhood and officers have been ordered this week to cancel upcoming days off ""to address current crime patterns."" ""In the event of civil unrest and looting, area deputy chiefs and commanders should identify mobilization points,"" the memo reportedly reads, noting that brass should designate special patrols to retail corridors. CHICAGO POLICE CANCEL DAYS OFF FOR OFFICERS FOLLOWING VIOLENT WEEKEND Another part of the memo, titled Central Business District Emergency Closure Procedures, explains how the Loop and Magnificent Mile areas could be closed, WLS reports, similar to what was done during rioting and looting that occurred in 2020. The station says commanders are being told to review the shutdown plan. In the 2020 demonstrations, some of which took place right after the death of George Floyd, the Chicago Police Department raised several bridges that connect downtown areas to the city's north and west sides so that protesters could not cross. In this past weekend’s unrest in the Loop neighborhood, two teens ages 12 and 15 were reported shot, dozens of young people flooded the area, fights broke out, police made 21 arrests of youths, a police officer suffered a broken arm, another officer was injured, and a convenience store owner was punched in the face. A Chicago bus driver also landed in the hospital after he was beaten on the streets that night in the same area, resulting in a 15-year-old boy being arrested. The social media account likely responsible for pulling together the unruly crowd is now planning a second event for this Saturday, according to CWB Chicago.

12/10/2021,"Travelers who ""wanna get away"" will have a new option on Southwest Airlines next year. In a presentation to investors Wednesday, the airline announced that it will introduce a ""new fare product"" midway through 2022. The fares will appear in a fourth column alongside Southwest's current Wanna Get Away, Anytime and Business Select offerings. Details are still under wraps, but Southwest Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Watterson said it will be above the airline's lowest priced Wanna Get Away category and offer enhanced attributes ""customers will happily pay a little bit more"" for. He stressed that the new product will not take anything away from other fares but offer something more. It will be available across all channels for business or leisure. Southwest also announced a new co-brand loyalty agreement with Chase, which is expected to contribute to the airlines' profitability. Details were not revealed on that either. ►Couple surprised luggage overweight: Their dog snuck in a boot ►Banking fees: Chase adds tools to help customers avoid overdraft fees – but it's not eliminating them No new destinations were announced for next year. Watterson said Southwest was probably done with new airports for a while. Instead, the airline plans to focus on maturing the 18 new markets it has added since 2020 as well as its Hawaii service. Outgoing CEO Gary Kelly said restoring the frequency of flights to existing destinations is the immediate priority. The airline on Wednesday announced new nonstop routes between Austin, Texas and Tulsa, Oklahoma; San Antonio, Texas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Syracuse New York and Tampa, Florida, with service set to begin in late April. He noted the airline has not stopped service to any of its destinations amid the pandemic. Kelly said he's confident incoming CEO Bob Jordan will take the airline to even greater heights when he retires in February. Kelly will continue to serve as chairman. ►'Truly the best job in our industry': American Airlines CEO Doug Parker announces retirement ►Cheap tickets, tiny airports: What it's like to fly new budget airline Avelo Jordan, who is currently an executive vice president, said he's already taken over day-to-day operations. He called the new role a joy he doesn't take for granted and thanked Kelly, who he called a mentor, sponsor and friend for 34 years. While Jordan said he expects 2022 to still be choppy and a time for rebuilding, he said Southwest remains committed to the vision of being ""the world's most loved, most efficient, and most profitable airline."" “While there are things to work on, as you've seen, we are not reinventing the company,” Jordan said. “There's no doubt the pandemic has been hard. … I'm happy that we are emerging but we are positioned as a company to emerge even better coming out of the pandemic.” ►'Unacceptable': Southwest Airlines investigating pilot who brought politics onto plane Heads of the company acknowledged that new COVID-19 waves and variants make predictions difficult, but Executive Vice President and CFO Tammy Romo said so far, they've not seen ""material impact from the latest COVID wave"" in bookings. Barring unforeseen circumstances, Romo said Southwest expects to report a profit in its fourth quarter and throughout 2022. The airline also expects to add at least 8,000 jobs next year.

12/10/2021,"Sen. Lindsey Graham said the GOP had been ""shot in the back"" over a deal to raise the debt ceiling. The deal between Senate leaders allows Democrats to raise the debt ceiling with a party-line vote. Graham reportedly told his colleagues that Trump would be ""engaged on this issue."" Sen. Lindsey Graham on Wednesday launched a blistering attack on GOP congressional leaders, saying at a closed-door party lunch that they'd put Republicans in a position to get ""shot in the back"" over a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling, The Hill reported. Congress is doing procedural jujitsu to lift the US's borrowing cap for already accrued debts in order to prevent the country from defaulting on its debts and triggering a global financial crisis. After months of pledging that no Republicans would help Democrats raise the ceiling, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell brokered a deal with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to enable Senate Democrats to do so with a party-line vote. Such machinations are needed because the upper chamber is divided between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, with Vice President Kamala Harris as a tiebreaker. A senator who attended the lunch told The Hill that Graham said the deal ""led them on a charge up a hill and they were getting shot in the back."" Other senators in the room told the news outlet that while it wasn't clear whether Graham was specifically blaming McConnell, the South Carolina Republican disapproved of McConnell's handling of the standoff. The senator who was at the lunch also told The Hill that Graham, an ally and confidant of former President Donald Trump, said that ""the president is going to be engaged on this issue"" when it comes time for the 2022 midterm elections and that those who supported McConnell's deal would face Trump's wrath. ""I think this is a mistake, but we'll see what happens,"" Graham told reporters after the lunch, according to The Hill. ""We've been telling our Republican base for four months, '[Democrats] are spending money by themselves, they should raise the debt ceiling by themselves through reconciliation.'"" Trump has railed against McConnell for paving the way for Democrats to raise the cap, insulting the Republican leader as a ""Broken Old Crow"" and excoriating him for not using the debt ceiling as leverage to block Democrats' $1.75 trillion social-spending package. ""And we have a thing called the debt ceiling, and this morning I hear he gave it up,"" Trump said in an interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Wednesday. ""He gave it up for practically nothing. He could have used the debt-ceiling card. As an example, he did a couple of things. He gave them a two-month extension to get their act together, and they got their act together."" Trump added: ""The debt ceiling is psychological. This is not psychological. This is fact. This will destroy our country, the fabric of the country as we know it."" A bill that the House passed on Tuesday would create a one-time exemption to the Senate filibuster to allow for a simple-majority vote on raising the debt ceiling. The bill also contains a provision that would postpone scheduled cuts to Medicare. The measure, which the Senate is set to take up on Thursday on a compressed timeline for debate, requires at least 10 Republicans' votes to pass. If the Senate passes the bill and President Joe Biden signs it into law, it would pave the way for Democrats to raise the debt ceiling on their own in a second bill.

12/10/2021,"MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) — A DNA match has helped cold case investigators solve the killing of a San Francisco Bay Area waitress whose body was found in a restaurant's basement bathroom 25 years ago, authorities said Thursday. A murder charge was filed by prosecutors against prison inmate Danny Lamont Hamilton, alleging he drowned Priscilla Lewis during an attempted rape and burglary at a restaurant in the city of Crockett on September 24, 1996, said a statement from the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office. The case went unsolved for decades after investigators interviewed dozens of people, submitted numerous pieces of evidence for analysis and executed several search warrants, the statement said. Detectives last year submitted additional evidence to a DNA crime lab and a match came back that linked Hamilton to the crime, the statement said. He is serving a life sentence at a state prison near San Diego after being convicted of sexual assault charges unrelated to Lewis’ death, authorities said. It was not known whether he has a lawyer who could speak on his behalf. Troy Kinslow, a cousin of Lewis who grew up with her in the nearby town of Port Costa, said her slaying haunted him for years. “I was across the street, at the bar drinking and had seen her on the break,” Kinslow said. “And the next morning I went to the store to get something to drink and a friend said, ‘you heard about her?’” He said he urged detectives three years ago to reexamine the case. “They told me, ‘you have been on us.’ My thousands of texts and calls got them fired up,” he said. Kinslow added: “It's been a long process and it's been very tiring emotionally and physically but I never gave up.”",U.S./Associated Press,DNA match solves case of California waitress killed in 1996,https://news.yahoo.com/dna-match-solves-case-california-020822067.html
