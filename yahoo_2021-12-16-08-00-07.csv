12/16/2021,"Omicron multiplies 70 times faster in the airways than delta yet replicates 10 times more slowly in the lungs, which may explain why it is very transmissible but less severe, scientists have said. Researchers at the University of Hong Kong studied how quickly the virus replicates in bronchial and lung tissue in the lab. They discovered that the virus was capable of replicating far faster in the bronchus - the tubes that attach the windpipe to the lungs - with more infection present after just 24 hours than delta produced after two days. However, the research showed the virus struggled to reproduce efficiently in lung tissue, which may explain why people are experiencing cold-like symptoms, but few cases are progressing to serious disease. Dr Michael Chan Chi-wai, the principal investigator, said the research may suggest omicron is less severe, but warned that a very transmissible variant could lead to more deaths, even if it was milder. “It is important to note that the severity of disease in humans is not determined only by virus replication but also by the host immune response to the infection, which may lead to dysregulation of the innate immune system, such as a cytokine storm,” said Dr Chan. “It is also noted that, by infecting many more people, a very infectious virus may cause more severe disease and death even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic. “Therefore, taken together with our recent studies showing that the omicron variant can partially escape immunity from vaccines and past infection, the overall threat from the omicron variant is likely to be very significant.” On Wednesday, Dr Meaghan Kall, an epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said that care homes and hospital wards were seeing 50 to 80 per cent of people infected - levels not seen since before the vaccination programme began. But she added: “They are mostly asymptomatic and mild infections. I remain optimistic about omicron being milder. “I think there’s cause for concern, but it hinges on how vaccines hold up against severe disease. And we don’t have much solid evidence on that.” So far, despite a surge in cases, there have currently been just 11 people admitted to hospital with confirmed omicron, five suspected cases and just one death. Commenting on the Hong Kong study, Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases researcher from the University of St Andrews, said: “For those asking whether this is good or bad news, simple answer: I don’t know. While omicron may infect the lung cells less efficiently, a higher viral load may worsen immune response. “The only thing I am sure of is that omicron will spread so quickly through the population, making it likely impossible to contain even with the most stringent measures and giving us very little time over the next few weeks. So get your vaccines and boosters.” In South Africa, which has seen a large wave of omicron, there have also been far fewer deaths than previous waves. The first major real-world study into the new variant published by South African scientists earlier this week found the variant is likely to be 23 per cent less severe than delta with vaccines still offering good protection A study of more than 78,000 omicron cases in South Africa recorded between November 15 and December 7, also found that the Pfizer jab still offers 70 per cent protection against hospitalisation after two doses. The research showed that compared with the first Wuhan strain, the virus led to 29 per cent fewer admissions to hospital, with 23 per cent fewer hospital admissions compared to delta. Far fewer people also needed intensive care from omicron, with just five per cent of cases admitted to intensive care units compared with 22 per cent of delta patients.",Health/The Telegraph,Omicron spreads 70 times faster in airways than delta but 10 times slower in lungs,https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-spreads-70-times-faster-184454061.html
12/16/2021,"Rep. Liz Cheney has made multiple references to a criminal statute discussing Trump in recent days. Cheney raised a law against ""corruptly"" obstructing or impeding an official congressional proceeding. Her comments came days after a judge upheld the use of that statute against January 6 defendants. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell offered a stern caveat in February after voting to acquit Donald Trump at the conclusion of his second impeachment trial: The former president, McConnell said then, was ""still liable for everything he did while he was in office as an ordinary citizen."" ""He didn't get away with anything yet,"" the Kentucky Republican added. On the other side of the Capitol, another well-known Republican lawmaker is now getting way more specific about the potential legal consequences awaiting Trump over his role in inciting the deadly January 6 attack that halted the official certification of the 2020 presidential election. In recent days, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming has drawn attention with public remarks that directly addressed Trump's potential criminal culpability in connection with the Capitol siege. Cheney, the Republican vice chair of the House committee investigating January 6, called attention to a federal statute making it illegal to obstruct an official proceeding. The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney spoke up about Trump's legal liability as the panel took steps to hold his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in contempt of Congress for ceasing cooperation with lawmakers' probe. ""Mr. Meadows' testimony will bear on a key question in front of this Committee: Did Donald Trump, through action or inaction, corruptly seek to obstruct or impede Congress's official proceeding to count electoral votes?"" Cheney said. ""Mr. Meadows' testimony will inform our legislative judgments on those issues."" In those remarks, legal experts saw a clear reference to a charge the the Justice Department has already brought against hundreds of January 6 defendants: ""corruptly obstructing an official proceeding."" It is the statute that could be relevant for any prosecution of Trump if evidence emerges that he planned or was aware of the violence that unfolded on January 6. ""It all depends on the facts. If the people who stormed the Capitol can be prosecuted for obstructing a congressional proceeding, if he played a role in that, then he's equally liable — whether it's instigating it, aiding and abetting it, planning it,"" said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and now a professor at the George Washington University Law School. ""But they have to show he had some kind of role as opposed to: He sees it happen, sits back and enjoys it, but doesn't do anything. They have to show that he played some role in causing it, not that the riot went out of control and he just gleefully watched it happen,"" Eliason added. Cheney isn't exactly pulling from thin air with her reference to the federal criminal code. Just days before her most recent remarks, a federal judge in Washington, DC, upheld the Justice Department's use of the obstruction of congressional proceedings charge in a key January 6 case. Judge Dabney Friedrich, a Trump appointee on the US District Court for the District of Columbia, rejected arguments from two Capitol riot defendants that Congress' certification of now-President Joe Biden's electoral victory wasn't an ""official proceeding"" for the purposes of the statute. The judge also dismissed assertions that the term ""corruptly"" was unconstitutionally vague in the statute and that the two defendants' conduct didn't ""obstruct, influence, and impede"" the proceedings of January 6. Cheney mentioned the statute Monday after rattling off texts in which Fox News anchors, lawmakers and even the then-president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., expressed alarm to Meadows over the Capitol attack and urged him to persuade Trump to have the angry mob stand down. The texts underscored how, on January 6, Trump allies viewed the sitting president as an authority figure singularly capable of putting an end to an attack that overwhelmed police and left five people dead. On Twitter, former US attorneys were struck by Cheney's clear reference to a criminal statute in discussing the House select panel's interest in Trump. ""They were his to command. Cheney raising the notion that by failing to stop them, Trump impeded Congress (could be a crime),"" wrote Joyce Vance, a former US attorney in northern Alabama. ""Wow. @Liz_Cheney going straight to possible criminal culpability by Trump as reason they need Meadows's testimony. They are not messing around,"" wrote Harry Litman, who served in the Obama administration as the top federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania. But in an interview, Eliason said the texts recited by Cheney — however damning in the court of public opinion — fall short of the threshold necessary to make a case against Trump. ""The idea that people thought he could stop it, and he didn't act or act quickly, I don't think that alone establishes criminal liability for what happened,"" said Eliason, who once oversaw the public corruption unit within the federal prosecutor's office in Washington, DC, which reviews congressional referrals. At the same time, Eliason acknowledged additional evidence that isn't yet public could still come out that changes the whole ballgame for the former president. ""If there was more suggesting he had more of an active role in encouraging it to happen,"" he said, ""potentially the charge applies to him just like it applies to anyone who broke in.""

 President Biden will nominate Caroline Kennedy and former figure skater Michelle Kwan to ambassadorships as part of a slate of diplomatic picks, the White House announced Wednesday. Biden announced his intent to nominate Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy, to serve as ambassador to Australia. Kwan is Biden's pick for ambassador to Belize. Kennedy, 64, previously served as ambassador to Japan during the Obama administration. She helped organize the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, including a visit by then-President Obama to Hiroshima. Kennedy was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Rising Sun in November for her work on the U.S.-Japan alliance. ""I look forward to collaborating with the Government of Australia to strengthen our alliance, improve global health and increase vaccine access during this terrible pandemic and to address the urgent climate crisis,"" Kennedy said of her potential confirmation in a statement through the White House. ""I am excited to get to know the Australian people, learn about their fascinating country and share with them what I love most about America."" If confirmed, she will serve in Australia at a time when the Biden administration has sought to revitalize the Quad alliance with Australia, India and Japan. Biden also announced he would nominate Kwan, 41, for ambassador to Belize. Kwan is the most decorated figure skater in U.S. history, having won two Olympic medals and five world championships. Since her career on the ice, Kwan has worked as an envoy for the Department of State, and she is currently a board member of Special Olympics International. ""I am honored to be nominated by President Biden to serve as ambassador to Belize, and if confirmed, I will be very proud to serve my country,"" Kwan said in a statement provided by the White House. ""Belize is full of incredible history and culture, and has been a tremendous partner to the United States. I look forward to working with the Belizean government on economic issues, to put an end to this pandemic, and to address regional migration."" The Senate has confirmed key ambassador nominees for the Biden administration, including those serving in Mexico and at NATO. But Republican senators have slow-walked or outright blocked confirmation efforts for numerous Biden nominees, prompting concerns from White House officials and Democrats.

12/16/2021,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Amid a severe drought, California regulators on Wednesday voted to advance what could be the state's first major new water storage project in decades, despite warnings from tribal and environmental groups that it would hasten the extinction of multiple species of salmon. The vote by the California Water Commission ensured that the Sites Reservoir project will remain eligible for about $800 million in taxpayer money, representing about 20% of the project's roughly $4 billion price tag. The reservoir is one of seven water storage projects scheduled to receive funding from a voter-approved bond in 2014. Most of the money would go to expanding existing reservoirs or building water recycling programs. But the Sites Reservoir is different because it would flood a valley in California’s coast range mountains to create a new lake that supporters estimate would be enough to supply 3 million households per year when filled to capacity. California has not built a major new reservoir since 1979. Since then, multiple droughts have strained the state's water supply and renewed calls for more ways to capture and store water from the state's major rivers and streams. “The Sites Reservoir project is not going to solve all of our problems,” said Jerry Brown, executive director of the Sites Reservoir Authority, and who is not related to the former Califonria governor with the same name. “If we do absolutely nothing, I can guarantee you things will get worse."" The California Water Commission on Wednesday said the project is feasible, meaning it has met all of the requirements to remain eligible for public funding. There are still many steps ahead for the project to receive the public funding, approval by the Water Commission before the end of the year was required for the project to maintain its eligibility. Environmental and tribal groups complained that the Water Commission acted prematurely in saying the project was feasible, especially since environmental reviews required by state and federal law have not been completed. Most of California's major reservoirs are connected to rivers and rely on gravity to fill them with water that comes from snowmelt in the mountains. The Sites Reservoir would have water pumped to it from the nearby Sacramento River. The idea behind the reservoir is to take water from the river only when it has extra water to give, such as during large storms like one last October that set a single-day Sacramento rainfall record. Environmental groups say that doesn't make sense because all of water in the rivers has a significant purpose. “There is no such thing as excess water in the environment,” said Steve Evans, rivers director for the California Wilderness Coalition. “That water is needed for fisheries and water quality in downstream ecosystems and every time you take it out of the system you are having an environmental impact.”",U.S./Associated Press,"Amid drought, California advances big new reservoir project",https://news.yahoo.com/amid-drought-california-advances-big-215532204.html
