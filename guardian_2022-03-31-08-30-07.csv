3/31/2022,"New Zealand’s glaciers are becoming “smaller and more skeletal” due to the effects of climate change and scientists predict many could disappear within a decade. An annual end-of-summer survey that records the snowline of more than 50 South Island glaciers has revealed continued loss of snow and ice. Every year, the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa), the Victoria University of Wellington and the conservation department gather thousands of aerial photographs of the glaciers to measure the altitude of the snowline and see how much of the previous winter’s snow has remained covering each glacier. That snowline, also known as the equilibrium line altitude (ELA), allows scientists to evaluate the glacier’s health. If the glacier size has decreased, then the line will be higher, because less winter snow remains. “We were expecting the snowlines to be high because of the warm weather we’ve had and sadly, our instincts were confirmed,” said Dr Andrew Lorrey, a principal scientist at Niwa. New Zealand’s glaciers had lost mass most years over the past decade, said Dr Lauren Vargo from Victoria University. “But what was more striking to me is how much smaller and more skeletal so many of the glaciers are becoming.” The country is experiencing more frequent temperature extremes, four to five times more extreme than would be expected in a climate with no long-term warming, Niwa reported in January, while 2021 was New Zealand’s hottest year on record. Last week, Antarctica recorded temperatures more than 40C warmer than seasonal norms. Gregor Macara, a Niwa climate scientist, said this year’s survey showed a noticeable difference from the previous years. “The snowline elevations this year were high, meaning much of the winter snows had melted, leaving a lot of glacial ice exposed. It appears to be yet another poor year for our ice, continuing the trend from recent years, and it is disheartening to see the ongoing decline.” The long-term aerial survey began in 1977, giving a visual timeline of how much glaciers have retreated. Since the survey began, the global climate has warmed by about 1.1C and Niwa estimates that more than a third of the ice volume has been lost from the Southern Alps. “What we’re seeing is a clear retreat, which is no doubt thanks to climate change. In a decade, we predict that many of our beloved and important glaciers will be gone,” Lorrey said. The ramifications are significant. Glaciers are an important store of fresh water, their seasonal melt into rivers supporting irrigation of farmland and hydropower schemes, and acting as a buffer against drought. The disappearing ice also contributes to rising sea levels. “This will have far reaching impacts, such as altering our beautiful landscape, affecting the livelihoods of people who rely on these natural wonders for tourism, and flow on effects from decreased meltwater during periods of drought,” Lorrey said. “It also emphasises the urgency of slowing climate change because the impacts are going to become increasingly costly and hard to avoid.”",News/Environment,"Many of New Zealand’s glaciers could disappear in a decade, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/many-of-new-zealands-glaciers-could-disappear-in-a-decade-scientists-warn
3/31/2022,"Football Australia has opted for short-term stability after giving its backing to the under fire Socceroos coach, Graham Arnold, who will remain in charge of the national team until the end of the 2022 World Cup qualification campaign. The vote of confidence comes despite a woeful recent run of results that has put his team’s chances of reaching the tournament in Qatar in the balance. FA on Thursday confirmed Arnold will remain in his position for the upcoming Asian confederation playoff against UAE on 7 June, and the potential intercontinental playoff with Peru that would follow the week after. FA said it would continue to work closely with Arnold ahead of the crucial game in Doha, where the Socceroos will attempt to arrest a run of two defeats and a draw, and a total of just six points claimed from their last seven qualifying matches. “The board of Football Australia believed it was important that we provided a stable environment and to get on with planning for the play-off phase given the very short turn-around,” said FA chair Chris Nikou. “By confirming that Graham will remain head coach of the Socceroos until the completion of our Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022 campaign, it enables Graham, his support staff and the playing group to move forward with certainty, and without delay, to ensure the best possible preparation for the next phase of qualification.” Australia’s hopes of automatically qualifying for the 2022 World Cup were ended with a 2-0 home defeat to Japan last week, rendering their final Group B match against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday a dead rubber. An experimental side fell 1-0 in Jeddah, leaving the Socceroos with a record of four wins, three draws and three losses from the third stage of Asian qualifying, and prompting speculation about Arnold’s future. The Saudis and Japan claimed the two direct qualification spots available. FA chief executive James Johnson said Arnold had the governing body’s full support and that the coach still has the opportunity to “finish the job he was appointed to in 2018 and see through his commitment to the national team”. “As we have done throughout the campaign, we will work closely with Graham to ensure the team has the necessary resources, support and the approach required to achieve the best possible outcome and ultimately qualification to our fifth consecutive Fifth World Cup.”",Sport/Football,Graham Arnold avoids axe as Football Australia gives backing to Socceroos coach,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/31/graham-arnold-avoids-axe-as-football-australia-gives-backing-to-socceroos-coach
3/31/2022,"Union leaders have accused the government of relying on “badly flawed” evidence to justify its plans for all schools in England to join academy trusts. The National Education Union (NEU) met the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, on Wednesday to challenge him over evidence used to support the government’s drive for full academisation by 2030, announced in the schools white paper earlier this week. Describing it as a “con job”, the NEU said the evidence cited in the government’s supporting document, The case for a fully trust-led system, published alongside the white paper on Monday, was “extremely weak” and potentially “misleading”. Academies are state-funded schools with higher degrees of autonomy in governance, use of resources and curriculum. The government said it wants all schools to either have become academies or be in the process of joining a multi-academy trust (Mat) by 2030, to “help transform underperforming schools and deliver the best possible outcomes for children”. The NEU said, however, there was no evidence to support the government’s claims. On the contrary, it said its own analysis of Ofsted judgments indicated that schools that join Mats are less likely to improve and more likely to fall back. According to the union’s research, local authority-maintained primary schools previously judged outstanding by Ofsted are more likely to retain that rating when re-inspected than other types of schools – 30% compared with just 7% of primaries in Mats. “Shockingly”, if an outstanding primary school in a Mat is transferred to another Mat in a process known as re-brokering, 0% retain their outstanding status, while only 12% of good or better local authority-maintained primary schools fall to less than good at their next inspection, compared with 35% of primaries in Mats. The Department for Education (DfE) roundly rejected the NEU’s criticisms. “The claims made are incorrect and based upon selective data, misrepresenting our published evidence. “We have a decade of evidence that academy trusts can transform underperforming schools. More than seven out of 10 schools that have become academies due to underperformance now have a good or outstanding Ofsted rating, compared to about one in 10 of the local authority-maintained schools they replaced,” a spokesperson said. “We want all schools to be part of a strong academy trust so they can benefit from the trust’s support in everything from teacher training, curriculum, financial planning and inclusivity towards children with additional needs, to excellent behaviour and attendance cultures.” But Kevin Courtney, NEU joint general secretary, said the union’s analysis made a nonsense of the government’s drive towards full academisation in the name of raising standards. “It demonstrates that there is no compelling reason for a school to join a trust. It also provides strong evidence against the re-brokering of schools from one Mat to another. “Nadhim Zahawi says he wants to be driven by evidence. He must respond to this evidence and must pause this ideological drive. Teachers and parents want the government to focus their efforts on supporting schools to improve and what works and to drop their ideological obsession with marketisation.” The NEU also accused the DfE of “systematically misreporting” Ofsted ratings for many schools when building its case for academy trusts, claiming outstanding judgments for schools in Mats that were awarded when those schools were council maintained. The union accused the DfE of using small samples in order to produce higher results for schools in Mats, and of failing to report information about pupil premium – additional funding for the most disadvantaged children – for these samples in a way that was “highly misleading”. Previous research by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) and others found little difference between attainment outcomes of academies and local authority-maintained schools. EPI’s head of analysis, Jon Andrews, said: “The ambition to move all schools into multi-academy trusts may be a necessary tidying up of the school landscape that has been left to fragment for over a decade, but it is not a silver bullet to improvement or equity. “If the government is going to argue that full academisation is going to lead to an improvement in standards then we need a much better understanding of what it is that the highest performing trusts are doing that sets them apart from the rest.”",News/Education,Education union criticises ‘badly flawed’ evidence behind academy drive,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/31/education-union-criticises-badly-flawed-evidence-behind-academy-drive
3/31/2022,"The UK video games market hit a new record of £7.16bn last year as the pandemic continued to fuel an unprecedented boom in home entertainment, with gamers rushing to stock up on new consoles and virtual reality kit even as overall sales of games fell. Lockdown conditions have made gaming one of the biggest pandemic winners with the value of the UK market now a third higher than in 2019 before the coronavirus crisis hit and worth more than the music and video streaming markets combined. The amount spent by gaming fans – on everything from new consoles, software and mobile games to themed events, toys and magazines – rose 1.9% year on year beating expectations that the market would slide following the gaming gold rush at the height of the pandemic in 2020. The overall market rose despite a 6.3% fall in the sale of video game software to £4.28bn, with the most popular titles including Electronic Arts’ Fifa 22, Activision Blizzard’s Call of Duty: Vanguard and Take-Two Interactive’s Grand Theft Auto V. “The important story here is how much of the lockdown related boost seen in 2020 has been successfully retained during 2021’s ‘year of correction’,” said Steven Bailey, a senior analyst at Omdia. The attractiveness of the gaming market – which is worth almost £1.8bn annually more than 2019 – has sparked a wave of consolidation with US and Chinese gaming companies splashing out more than £2bn on British video games makers over the last two years. The growth in the market last year was underpinned by continued strong demand from gamers for new consoles, the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and more recently the Nintendo Switch OLED edition, which grew by a third to £1.13bn. There was also significant growth in virtual reality hardware, such as headsets, with sales up 42% to £183m as gamers increasingly embrace new technologies. Revenue from mobile games maintained its pandemic lockdown level remaining flat at £1.46bn while licensed toys and merchandise grew 34% to £159m, largely thanks to the popularity of Pokemon. “The UK is a nation that loves its video games and we should be proud of the positive contribution that this sector makes to the economy, our culture and to wider society,” said Jo Twist, the chief executive of the UK gaming body Ukie, which publishes the annual report. The lockdown boom in video games has sparked a wave of consolidation with the success of British games makers making the UK a prime target of foreign buyers with deep pockets. In December 2020, California-based EA paid £945m for Southam, England-based Codemasters, the maker of the Formula One series of racing games. Six months later China’s Tencent paid £919m for the Sheffield-based, London-listed video games developer Sumo Group. And in March last year, Epic, the maker of the global hit Fortnite, acquired the UK-based Mediatonic, the creator of the lockdown smash hit Fall Guys. In January, Microsoft crowned the latest round of consolidation with a $70bn (£53bn) deal to buy Activision Blizzard, the publisher of mega franchises including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, in its biggest-ever deal and the largest-ever takeover in the tech and gaming sectors.

3/31/2022,"Is there a gap in the market for an ensemble TV show about comedians’ lives? At least since Seinfeld, there has been no shortage of telly shows about standup, tangentially or otherwise, from Louie to Hacks, and from I’m Dying Up Here to the Netflix hit The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. And yet, Standing Up – also on Netflix – feels fresh to me: its characters are engaging, its insights into the standup life are sometimes schematic but faithful to the unglamorous yet folk-heroic reality. The twist – and maybe the source of its freshness – is that Standing Up (AKA Drôle) is from France, whose standup scene is younger and more distinctively diverse than its UK and US equivalents. I wrote about this last year, quoting a joke by the Franco-Ivorian act Shirley Souagnon: “Do you know the difference between theatre and standup? The colour.” Standing Up – created by the showrunner of the terrific Call My Agent!, Fanny Herrero – focuses on the ups-and-downs of four standups, centring around titular comedy club Le Drôle. There’s French-Algerian Nezir, living in the banlieues with his disabled dad, struggling to make ends meet. There’s Aïssatou, who is Black, and on the threshold of stardom after a video goes viral, even as her intimate standup throws her personal relationships into disarray. Add into the mix washed-up Bling, the son of Vietnamese immigrants, who runs the club but whose standup career is in freefall, and rookie Apolline, concealing comedy ambitions from her well-heeled family, and you have enough narrative plates spinning to easily sustain this enjoyable six-part show. The point, of course, is to show how these characters’ standup interacts with their hectic lives. On one level, that’s about sweet Nezir and simpering Apolline seducing one another through comedy. On another, it’s about Bling’s midlife panic expressing itself through the misanthropy of his jokes. Standing Up also enacts the scorched-earth effects of comedy on a performer’s family – rather too starkly for my tastes, as Aïssatou’s husband gets the hump at being the butt (in more ways than one) of her most notorious joke. What I can’t promise is that those standup routines will have you clutching your aching sides. I found the cast, who are actors, perfectly convincing as standups. (Actual standups – including Souagnon – feature in the writing team and in background roles.) But we only ever see snippets of their acts, which in any case are in French. We have to take it on trust when Aïssatou’s “sketch” about fingering her husband’s anus goes viral. Out of context and on our screens, it’s not hilarious. But that’s not what the show’s trying to do. Its interest in standup – and this is instructive of how the artform is now considered, at least in dramatic terms – is in its relationship to the artists’ personal lives. “What I found interesting,” Herrero has said, “is that standups are able to reveal things about themselves in their acts that they wouldn’t in their everyday lives.” We see it in Mrs Maisel, and we see it here: the standup stage as a place where performers immediately refashion real-life incident into comedy. It’s a fantasy version of an artform in which the route from real-world experiences into effective comedy is seldom a straight line. It’s also a trope that fetishises authenticity and elevates one particular brand of standup (personal, confessional), forgetting that comedy is as broad as the human imagination. No place here for prop comics, one-liner merchants, surrealists, anti-comics, character comics – or any of the myriad other ways that a solo performer can make audiences laugh. But I get it: those kinds of comedy are harder to dramatise. They don’t let you see characters working out their emotional issues and developing their authentic voice in public, in-the-moment – which in storytelling terms is inherently satisfying. That’s certainly the case here, in a show that’s winningly fond of its characters, and makes something quietly heroic of their determination to get onstage at the end of every fraught day, to raise a smile and tell their truths. It is insightful too, into the trade-offs that standups (particularly those, perhaps, from marginalised backgrounds) can face as the mainstream beckons. Or into the taboo around joke thievery, which is especially sharp in a standup culture recently rocked by a plagiarism row. Four episodes in, it’s got me hooked, and has burnished my faith in the democratic romance of club comedy. Standing Up is on Netflix",Arts/Stage,C’est Drôle!

3/31/2022,"Across social media, internet forums and some climate science denier blogs, there has been furious cutting-and-pasting of chunks of common text attacking the environmental credentials of electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines. About 200 tonnes of the “Earth’s crust” needs to be mined for each electric vehicle battery, and 11 tonnes of brine are needed just for the lithium, claims the text, which also says solar panels and wind turbine blades can’t be recycled. Some claims are made definitively and without context, and don’t try to compare electric vehicle batteries to the fossil fuelled cars they are replacing. Solar panels can be recycled and fully recyclable turbine blades are now being produced. The former resources minister and Queensland senator Matt Canavan was another to share some of the text that sat above a picture of a hollowed-out landscape. It took a few seconds to discover the scary but irrelevant image was of a diamond mine in Canada. That’s a picture of a diamond mine in Canada. https://t.co/hOrPW4EV8c On Facebook, some posts using extracts are being marked with a label saying “Missing context. Independent fact-checkers say this information could mislead people.” One fact check site categorises one post as a “scare tactic” containing only partial truths. An Australian climate “sceptics” group posted a version of the essay the extracts come from earlier this year. Prof Peter Newman, a sustainability expert at Curtin University and a senior author of an upcoming UN climate assessment on mitigation, said the numbers related to the resources needed to produce electric vehicle batteries were “nonsense” because they referred to the early days of lithium battery development. Newman told Temperature Check the claims around brine and lithium were “based on the fears associated with brine extraction in the Andes’s countries, especially Chile, and human slavery in the Democratic Republic of the Congo over Cobalt.” But he said lithium extraction was moving away from brine to a mineral called spodumene, with Western Australia now its biggest producer. That mining, Newman said, was “ethical and sustainable.” The WA government says the state now produces 49% of the world’s lithium – meaning that at least half of the world’s supply comes without processing salty brine in places like Chile. Commenting more generally, Newman said “rumours about critical minerals” had been spreading for too long. “Their time is up. The world is replacing oil with sunshine made possible because of the dramatically successful Lithium Ion battery. “Compare [this] with the numbers on air pollution deaths at 10,000 a day, the wars created over oil and the climate change impacts.” But what are the origins of the text extracts? Versions have appeared on Facebook and LinkedIn, many crediting the work to a different writer – including the version promoted by Canavan. But it appears those versions were taken from an essay written last November by a US-based writer. Temperature Check asked the writer where he had sourced his facts. He said he “tried to find at least two credible sources for each of the things I claim” and said “all of the statements are readily available on the internet.” His work was “designed to be fun to read and to get people thinking”, he said. It’s worth saying here that most people appreciate any new purchase – whether that’s a fossil-fuelled car or an e-bike – has an environmental cost and that raw materials have to be mined. But electric cars are not permanently tied to fossil fuel production and the associated greenhouse gas emissions in the same way that internal combustion engines are; Australia’s motor vehicles burn 33bn litres of fuel every year. Calling all kids and millennials. The veteran News Corp Australia columnist Piers Akerman had a message for you this week. Climate activists have turned you into “ill-informed, unintelligent snowflakes” in a country with a “group think mentality”. Akerman told his Sunday Telegraph readers the Black Summer bushfires were not unprecedented or the “biggest recorded in history” and the ongoing floods “were not the worst in history in terms of life lost”. Using deaths as a measure of the severity of a flood rather than, say, the actual river heights or record-breaking rainfall will no doubt be of great comfort to people mourning their own losses in their communities while trying to rebuild their lives in places like Gympie, Brisbane, Lismore, Ballina and Sydney. On bushfires, we have to be careful with the term “unprecedented” and Akerman, of course, doesn’t appeared to be bothered. But studies of the Black Summer bushfires have found the wide-scale destruction along the east coast in the Eucalypt-dominated forests were indeed unprecedented in terms of where they happened and their scale. The effects of global heating on the risk of more frequent bushfires has been known for decades. CSIRO research says before 2002 there was only one megafire in 90 years of records, but there had been three since then. Last year the scientists wrote: “Since 2001 winter fires have soared five-fold compared to 1988–2001 and autumn fires threefold. Overall, fires in the cooler months of March to August are growing exponentially at 14% a year.” Take that, snowflakes. The former Tony Abbott chief of staff, Peta Credlin, attacked Labor’s proposed climate policy – announced months ago – in her column this week, repeating another Canavan claim that Gladstone’s aluminium plant would face a $54m annual bill by 2050 under an Albanese government. Canavan’s claim is based on the idea that Rio Tinto – which majority owns Gladstone’s two alumina refineries and runs the town’s smelter – would have to buy carbon credits under Labor’s plan to stay under a proposed emissions cap. Leaving aside the assumption from Canavan and Credlin that Labor is apparently about to enter three decades of government, perhaps the pair should have checked the figure with Rio Tinto? The company said publicly in October it has a target to cut direct emissions in half by 2030 “supported by around $7.5bn of direct investments to lower emissions between 2022 and 2030.” Jakob Stausholm, Rio Tinto’s chief executive, said the company was looking at using renewable energy to power its operations, and said “a decade down the road we cannot continue using coal-fired power for aluminium smelters.” If Rio Tinto makes anything like the progress on emissions its policies claim, then Canavan’s claimed $54m bill disappears. Unless you’ve been living under a solar panel for the last few months, it has been hard to miss the Morrison government’s $31m marketing campaign, Making Positive Energy. “We’ve already put solar panels here, here, and there,” says the voiceover, while a giant animated finger points to the roofs of businesses, homes and a huge solar plant. “In fact, more than one in four homes has solar.” Yesterday the UK-based pro-renewables thinktank Ember released its annual report looking at changes to the way electricity is generated around the world. The report found much truth to the idea that Australia’s uptake of solar and also wind has been among the fastest in the world in recent years. According to the report, Australia gets 12% of its electricity from solar – now the highest proportion of any major country (meaning a nation with at least 3 million people). Between 2019 and 2021, the report says the share of wind and solar for Australia’s electricity generation jumped from 13% to 22%. So is the federal government right to be taking credit for this renewables surge in its marketing campaign? Ember’s David Jones, the global program lead, said Australia’s renewable’s growth “has been driven from the bottom up.” “This is very different from many countries where national governments lead the charge. It’s very refreshing to see so many people embracing homegrown solar, even as the national government continues to push for more oil and gas”.",News/Environment,A cut-and-paste attack on electric vehicle batteries and renewables is spanning the globe.

3/31/2022,"The news of Bruce Willis’s retirement on health grounds brings its own special kind of sadness. Admittedly, he has been booking some dodgy films in the last year or so – I recently sat through a pretty sorry action thriller called Out of Death with Bruce in his comfort zone as the retired cop who has to take on a terrifying situation. But even there, Willis’s coolly amiable, faintly contemptuous, always battle-ready presence sprinkled a little much-needed vinegar in the blandness. And so often in so many different kinds of film, Bruce Willis has been the wild card – or, actually, the trump card.He has been the archetypal super-testosterone male-pattern baldness hombre, the guy who made wearing a vest – not a t-shirt, a vest – look iconic. Despite being the rebel with bullshit-detector on high alert, Bruce has often been cast as the authority figure. (When I first read PJ O’Rourke libertarian screed Republican Party Reptile, I thought of Willis.) For all of us, he will always be the legendary maverick warrior-cop John McClane in Die Hard saving his estranged wife in a high-rise office block on Christmas (perhaps saving Christmas itself) with that bizarre battle-cry: “Yippee-kai-ay, motherfucker!” and putting the all-American smackdown on loathsome Euro-Brit terrorist bad guys like Alan Rickman and Jeremy Irons.But what a superbly subtle, gentle performance as child psychologist Dr Malcolm Crowe in M Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense, deeply troubled by the state of his marriage and grappling with the most worrying case of his career – the kid played by Haley Joel Osment who makes an eerie claim to certain visions. Somehow, the film’s whiplash final twist does not diminish Willis who maintains a plain-speaking humorous dignity throughout. In Wes Anderson’s comedy Moonrise Kingdom he plays another cop, the quietly spoken small town officer Captain Sharp who has to deputise kids in the local scout troop for the search party when two young lovers go missing. It’s such a lovely, gentle performance – maybe my absolute favourite of his. But for sheer impact, it can’t match his Butch Coolidge in Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction: the punchy prizefighter with the troubled childhood memories who contrives to kill the hitman sent to kill him for winning a fight he’d been bribed to throw – and then rescues the guy who wants to kill him from an awful fate. Willis, the grizzle-haired tough guy with a sense of humour, is the only actor who could have carried off this supremely bizarre role and even endow it with sympathy and even underdog charm. It’s so sad for all of us that Willis will not take any more movie roles. It’s like seeing a great sports star suddenly getting an injury or a sandwich shop deciding to withdraw one of its tastiest flavours. All we can do is wish all the best to Bruce and his family for a happy retirement.",Arts/Film,"Soft, gentle and always battle-ready: Bruce Willis is an action star to stir the heart",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/30/bruce-willis-retire-aphasia-die-hard
