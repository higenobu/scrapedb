2/16/2022,"At least four people have died and 17 are missing after a Spanish fishing boat sank in bitterly cold seas off the north-east coast of Canada early on Tuesday morning. Spain’s maritime rescue service said an international operation was under way to locate the crew of the Villa de Pitanxo, a boat from the north-western Galicia region that went down 280 miles (450km) off the Newfoundland coast.  The service said three people had been rescued and four bodies had been found in a life raft, adding that the search operation was being hindered by wind, rough seas and reduced visibility. “An air and sea operation has been launched to rescue the 24 crew members of the Villa de Pitanxo fishing vessel, a 50-metre-long fishing boat that operates from Marín, in Pontevedra,” it said. “The crew is made up of 16 Spaniards, five Peruvians and three Ghanaians.” A plane, two helicopters and four boats are combing the area for survivors. Canadian rescuers said they were optimistic, despite the bad weather. “The fact that we have already found three survivors in a life raft gives us that hope that others were able to either get into their survival suits, get into life rafts and get off the vessel,” Brian Owens, of Canada’s Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, told AFP. The centre added: “The search continues for the remaining crew and we hold out hope that we will find them. We will update as soon as more information becomes available.” It said the Villa de Pitanxo sent out a distress signal just after midnight local time on Tuesday. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the government was in constant contact with the rescue services. “We’re following the search and rescue effort for the crew of the Galician boat that sank off Newfoundland with worry and concern,” Sánchez tweeted. “All my love to their families.” Alberto Núñez Feijóo, the regional president of Galicia, also said his thoughts were with the families of the crew. “We’re following the terrible news that has reached us from Canada of the sinking of the Villa de Pitanxo, a boat from Marín,” he said, adding that the regional government was ready to do whatever it could to help.",News/World news,Four dead and 17 missing as Spanish fishing boat sinks off Canada,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/dead-and-missing-as-spanish-fishing-boat-sinks-off-canada
2/16/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel celebrated Super Bowl Sunday, “AKA cryptocurrency awareness day”, on Monday evening, a day after the LA Rams topped the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20. “It’s all crypto now, even the half-time show – Bloods versus the Cryptos,” he joked, referring to plethora of advertisements for cryptocurrencies.  “It was crypto and Peacock [NBC’s streaming platform] all day long,” he continued. “There were more ads for Peacock than there are living peacocks on the planet Earth.” Kimmel also praised the half-time show performance, a medley of 90s and early 2000s hip-hop hits by Dr Dre, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J Blige and Kendrick Lamar. “You know a musical performance is cool when every 45 seconds your mother asks, ‘Who is that?’” said Kimmel. “They’re going to be talking about this one on Fox News for many years to come.” And in other news, after days of events on manufactured snow, the Winter Olympics postponed women’s downhill, delayed giant slalom and women’s slopestyle events this weekend because of actual snowfall in Beijing. “That’s right, snow disrupted the Winter Olympics,” said Kimmel. “This is like water disrupting a swim meet – it doesn’t make sense.” “Everyone’s still talking about the amazing half-time show starring Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg,” said Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show. “Two legends of hardcore gangsta rap, or as the kids call them today: Martha Stewart’s friend and the headphones guy.” “But as always, the star of the game was the commercials, and this year a ton of them were pushing crypto,” he continued. Coinbase aired a spot with a floating magenta QR code, Larry David shilled for FTX, and a crypto.com ad featured LeBron James advising his younger self to learn more about the site. “If he really wants to look out for young LeBron, tell him to avoid Space Jam 2,” Colbert joked. The Monday after the Super Bowl is traditionally one of the least productive workdays of the year, but “that queasy feeling might not be from the queso you ate last night,” Colbert said. “It could be because US officials are warning that Putin could invade Ukraine at any time. “That’s not the kind of will-he-or-won’t-he that I look forward to on Valentine’s Day,” Colbert noted. And on The Daily Show, Trevor Noah scrapped plans for commentary on the Super Bowl and Ukraine in favor of an extended interview with the singer India Arie, in what he described as “truly one of my favorite conversations with a human being that I ever thought I could have”. Last week, the singer announced that she would remove her music from Spotify in protest of the platform’s financial support of podcast host Joe Rogan, because she objected to his “language around race”. She also posted a compilation of clips to her Instagram account of Rogan, who is also under fire for promoting vaccine misinformation on his popular podcast, using the N-word more than 20 times. Rogan subsequently issued an apology, calling the compilation “the most regretful and shameful thing that I’ve ever had to talk about publicly”. Noah had previously devoted a 15-minute segment to the controversy around Rogan’s apology and continued support on Spotify, in which he concluded Rogan was “using racism to be entertaining”. Arie delineated between “conscious” and “unconscious” racism, offering “forgiveness” for the latter, and also arrived at the conclusion that for Joe Rogan, “he is being consciously racist”. “I think he was saying it because it got a rise out of people,” she said. “That’s why he would say it. He knew that it was inappropriate. And I think the fact that he did it repeatedly and was conscious and knew, I think that is being racist.” Arie said she was initially inclined to give Rogan the benefit of the doubt with his apology, since “he tried”, but “when I go deeper and ask myself what I really think from my commitment to truth that I’ve made this last year, what I really think is that he was being consciously racist and it makes me wonder what he talks like behind closed doors”. “I don’t think being a racist makes you a bad person, necessarily,” she later added. “It makes you a person who was raised in our society. But when does it cross over into being a bad person, or being harmful? “You have racist thoughts that you can institute with power, and that’s racism,” she said. “And so if you’re Joe Rogan and you have this huge listening audience, by you doing that, you embolden them to do that. And now we’re in trouble as a society.” Noah expounded on this view, and wondered aloud if society could cultivate compassion for redemption. “I think we should all be able to critique, criticize, talk shit and still live in a world where you go, even thought you fucked up I still don’t want you to be ostracized into a world that will encourage that behavior only,” he said. “Maybe that’s how I see it.” “That’s how I see it, too,” Arie responded, though she doubted Rogan “fully understands what he did there”. The singer noted the barrage of racial slurs from his fans in her DMs. “Joe Rogan needs to do more than just go, ‘Oh yeah, I’m sorry,’” she said. “If you want to really lead your listeners down a new path, then lead them! To the point where they don’t feel that is the right language to come in my DMs and call me an ‘N-word’ in defense of him.”",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on the Super Bowl: ‘Cryptocurrency awareness day’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/15/jimmy-kimmel-super-bowl-cryptocurrency-late-night
2/16/2022,"A 300ft wind turbine has been blown over in a south Wales valley as the UK braces for more dangerous stormy weather and high winds later this week. Residents of the village of Gilfach Goch, near Bridgend, were woken at 6.50am on Monday when the £20m turbine – double the height of Nelson’s Column – snapped apart and crashed into the valley below.  The crumpling of its blades was described as sounding like “thunder and lightning” by some who heard it crash down from the 10-turbine Pant y Wal windfarm. Lydia Stephens said: “A wind turbine fell over in the windfarm on my village this morning and I thought it was thunder and lighting but how the hell does a wind turbine fall over? “Apparently it was creaking and banging all night before it collapsed and one woman thought it was her neighbour’s tumble dryer.” The windfarm, which opened in 2013, generates enough power for 18,000 homes. Villagers are calling on officials to inspect the remaining nine turbines, with further high winds expected across the UK this week. The Labour councillor Aurfron Roberts said: “The whole village is surrounded by turbines, we have so many projects going on on the hills around her. I’m just glad they are up on the hillside and away from people in case something like this happens. “I hope this means owners will be extra vigilant and take care. It’s probably just a really unfortunate accident but it’s lucky no one was hurt.” A spokesperson for the wind turbine’s manufacturer, Nordex, said “all necessary safety measures have been implemented” following the collapse and that the cause remained under investigation. Motorists were warned to consider cancelling planned journeys this week as two storms approached the UK. Storm Dudley will hit the north from Wednesday night until Thursday, followed by Storm Eunice, with strong winds and even snow expected on Friday. “We’re encouraging drivers to check the latest weather and travel conditions before setting off on journeys and consider if their journey is necessary and can be delayed until conditions improve,” said the National Highways head of road safety, Jeremy Phillips. “If you do intend to travel, then plan your journey and take extra care, allowing more time.” The Met Office has issued amber weather warnings for Wednesday evening for strong winds, covering southern Scotland, northern England and part of Northern Ireland. Storm Eunice could bring heavy rain and possible snowfall on high ground from the Midlands northwards, the Met Office said. It added that high winds were likely to create blizzard conditions. Its chief meteorologist, Paul Gundersen, said: “An active jet stream is driving low-pressure systems across the country, both of which are likely to cause some disruption and national severe weather warnings have been issued.” Storm Dudley is expected to bring gales of up to 90mph to some coastal areas and hills in Scotland, while Storm Eunice will hit central areas of the UK on Friday with further strong winds expected.",News/UK news,Wind turbine blown over in Wales with more storms expected for UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/storms-uk-weather-wind-turbine-blown-over-wales
2/16/2022,"First we see him leaning against a wall, arms folded, a working man with pen and paper tucked into the breast pocket of his checked shirt. Then he is kneeling, removing his cap, one hand resting on a Bible as he raises the other and swears a solemn oath.  This is Wharlest Jackson, long dead and long denied justice, but preserved forever on film at the moment he takes a stand against the Ku Klux Klan. Not long after joining a Black armed resistance group in Natchez, Mississippi, the 37-year-old will be murdered with impunity. Jackson is among dozens of forgotten victims of Jim Crow violence whose cold cases are being rediscovered, reinvestigated and retold after half a century. The process does not necessarily deliver justice or end the pain of descendants. But it does contribute, as the title of a new film puts it, to an American Reckoning. “As film-makers, I think we are extracting the truth from the graves of these people,” co-director Yoruba Richen says via Zoom from New York. “One thing that we can do is put their stories out there and, as much as we can, have the full story told.” Drawing on rare vérité footage shot more than 50 years ago, the documentary offers an unusually intimate glimpse of the civil rights era in the deep south. Film of young African Americans throwing a football, playing in an abandoned car and riding bikes and horses makes for a vivid contrast with the horror of the white-robed Klan, said to have a bigger per-capita presence in Natchez than anywhere else. A white supremacist is seen giving a bellicose speech above a giant Confederate battle flag, symbol of the slave-owning south during the civil war. He tells the crowd: “This is your America! This is your land! We are not going to be run out of our own country by a bunch of cannibals and savages.” Among the film’s interviewees is Debra Taylor, daughter of Klan member Sonny Taylor, who recalls: “He beat us all for talking to any Black. We were not allowed. He thought we should send them back to Africa or kill them off.” Medgar Evers, field secretary of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest civil rights organisation in the country) in Mississippi, was assassinated in 1963. Two years later George Metcalfe, president of the NAACP’s Natchez chapter, was severely injured by a car bomb. Protests ensued but there was little hope of protection from a police department that included Klan members in its ranks. American Reckoning shows how Black people formed armed self-defence groups such as the Deacons for Defense and Justice. Richen, 49, who is African American, says: “I hope that people will understand that the Black freedom struggle involved many different strategies and wasn’t just reduced to the non-violent when you’re-attacked-don’t-attack-back, but that we did defend our communities and had to because of white terrorism.” The archival footage from 1965 and 1967 – much of it never broadcast before – came from film-makers Ed Pincus and David Neuman and was made available through the Amistad Research Center. Richen and co-director Brad Lichtenstein were thrilled to discover the material including Jackson, the focal point of their narrative. Lichtenstein recalled: “Yoruba and I both virtual high-fived and celebrated when we saw Wharlest Jackson walk in to the swearing-in ceremony.” It was about 8pm on 27 February 1967 when Jackson’s pick-up truck exploded as he was driving home from the Armstrong Tire & Rubber Company, where he had recently gained a promotion. The father of five, treasurer of the local NAACP chapter, suffered extensive damage to the lower-half of his torso and died at the scene. The FBI concluded that the bomb or other explosive device was placed under the driver’s seat area on the outside of the frame of the truck. But the culprit was never identified or arrested. American Reckoning begins with footage of Jackson’s funeral. One mourner comments: “They’ve been killing us here for 400 years.” Another voice is heard: “Wake up, white people, before it’s too late.” Lichtenstein, 53, who is white, explains: “We open with that because the whole point of calling this American Reckoning is to say that there isn’t anything exceptional about this era. “What is still with us, besides lots of violence that’s racially motivated, is white denial. Part of the controversy in this country about critical race theory is an extension of that denial – we’re not teaching history that makes people feel uncomfortable as much as we know it’s the truth.” Speaking by phone while driving in Mississippi, Lichtenstein continues: “I was just in a room of about 50 or 60 people, about two-thirds white, in Natchez. Just now is Natchez starting to reckon with this past, starting to put up memorials, starting to teach about it.” The film also shows the late activist and congressman John Lewis leading a federal government effort to investigate civil rights-era cold cases. The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act was signed into law in 2008. This prompted newspaper journalist Stanley Nelson to investigate allegations that a Ku Klux Klan offshoot, known as the Silver Dollar Group, was involved in Jackson’s murder. But although the late Raleigh “Red” Glover, leader of the Silver Dollar Group, is the prime suspect, the FBI closed the case without an official verdict. The film shows Jackson’s son, Wharlest Jr, and daughter, Denise, hurt and tearful as they realise they will never get definitive answers. They are not alone. Of more than 150 cases opened under the Till Act , all but 25 have been closed, and the justice department has not yet brought a single indictment. Richen, whose past credits include The Killing of Breonna Taylor, says: “This film and this story shows the limits of the justice system, especially for cases where most of the people have passed on. They’re not going to get anybody in jail for these crimes but I think it can be a way to talk about what is justice. “One of the things that we learned in making this film is that Congressman Lewis wanted a bigger bill. He wanted a truth and reconciliation-type bill, in the realm of what South Africa did after apartheid, that would bring stories to light. But it wasn’t something that was politically viable at the time.” She adds: “It opens up a conversation of what justice can be for these families, of reparations, of truth and reconciliation. Now we’re having a conversation about reparations, which a few years ago was a fringe idea. These things take time and can be very slow but I do think this can be a way to begin that conversation.” The Mississippi state flag incorporated the Confederate battle emblem for 126 years. It was finally removed in 2020. Lichtenstein reflects: “If we don’t address racist violence and white supremacist violence in this country right now, 50 years from now we’re going to be talking about the cold cases of 2022. You listen to the words that people were saying in 1965 in the footage and there really isn’t much difference between then and now. “The protest movements, the same kinds of demands: we really haven’t changed that much as a country. People tend to sensationalise the violence back then because the KKK wore hoods and burned crosses but today we have plenty of white militia groups and just everyday people in a system that continues to terrorise Black communities in this country. “The reason we called it American Reckoning is in part, to call up that relationship between the past and the present.” America Reckoning is available on PBS from 16 February with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,American Reckoning: shining a light on civil rights-era cold cases,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/15/american-reckoning-film-shines-light-civil-rights-era-cold-cases

2/16/2022,"The sight of a magnificent white-tailed eagle has once again become common for those lucky enough to live in the flight path of those recently introduced to the Isle of Wight. Thousands of Britons have seen and heard the giant two-metre wings beating overhead, and seen the cruel-beaked birds dramatically dive for fish. For us, living in a nature-depleted country, seeing such a large predator in the wild takes the breath away. White-tailed eagles were driven to extinction in Britain in the early 20th century, and persecution by landowners was the leading cause. Shot at and poisoned by those hoping to protect their game birds, Britain’s largest bird of prey didn’t stand a chance.  Yet thanks to the work of conservationists, these raptors are now frequently spotted in the skies above the Isle of Wight and Scotland – and sometimes even further afield. It’s the result of years of breeding programmes and negotiations with the Scottish and English governments. But the tragedy that originally robbed us of perhaps our most awesome airborne predator looks as though it could repeat itself. Two of these giants have now been found dead on estates in Dorset and Sussex. While the cause of death has not been established, the multi-agency police investigation suggests that foul play could have been involved. Currently, officers are conducting toxicology reports, suggesting they believe the eagles could have been poisoned. Sadly, this is all too common. In 2020 there were 137 confirmed incidents of raptor persecution, according to RSPB figures. However, these are only instances where a body is found quickly enough to determine the cause of death. Many more tagged birds of prey simply disappear, never to be seen again. A 2019 study found that of 58 hen harriers tagged over 10 years, 72% were either “confirmed to have been illegally killed or disappeared suddenly with no evidence of a tag malfunction.” Gamekeepers have previously been found to be behind the poisoning of our raptors, as they prey on grouse and other birds stocked by estates for shooting parties. A bird of prey soaring above a shoot also makes the birds scatter, disappointing those who have paid to kill them. After a series of poisonings of rare white-tailed eagles on grouse estates in Scotland, the Scottish government took action, suspending general shooting licences in the hope it would reduce these crimes. But sources at the Home Office have told me it is very difficult to secure prosecutions for the crime of taking an endangered bird out of the sky. And for many of the Conservative MPs who represent constituencies full of shooting estates and the homes of the landed gentry, wildlife crime is not a priority. Chris Loder, MP for West Dorset, has said that eagles are not welcome in his constituency and suggested that the police shouldn’t even be investigating their deaths. He said: “Dorset is not the place for eagles to be reintroduced. I’m not challenging government for more money for Dorset so it goes on this. I don’t condone this at all, but I want Dorset police to focus on county lines rather than spend time and resources on this.” The local wildlife crime team pointed out to their representative that county lines gangs are not in their jurisdiction, that they work overtime to help Britain’s wildlife, and that wildlife crime is often linked to other serious crimes, including gun offences. What message is Loder sending to those who want to kill wildlife in west Dorset? The MP has essentially given them a free pass, and signalled that eagles are not welcome in the skies above his constituency. And, despite what Loder says, eagles were not reintroduced specifically to Dorset; rather they flew out of the constituencies of wildlife-friendly MPs into those represented by the likes of Loder. His constituents could benefit from the eagles if they were to be reintroduced – a study found that those released on the Isle of Mull in Scotland brought millions to the economy, as people travelled to see the birds and spent money in local businesses. But his attitude perhaps comes as no surprise. Of the 10 biggest landowners in Dorset, eight are country estate owners, and many of these host shoots. This is not to say they had anything directly to do with the raptor deaths, but it perhaps shows why the MP is likely to consider the traditional concerns of the landed gentry over the right of everyday British people to enjoy wildlife. The problem is, there is no way to meaningfully help these birds recover and properly repopulate in the UK if there are no real consequences for those who kill them. Unless those who own estates are properly held to account for poisoned birds found on their land – perhaps having their shooting licences suspended until they can get a handle on crimes occurring under their noses – this will likely keep happening. There are few things that make me shake with anger more than the idea of a rare and magnificent bird curling up to die, a burning stomach full of poison, never to fly again. But even those who do not feel so strongly about this matter should take issue with the fact that criminals are getting away with destroying our wildlife and the country’s natural legacy, and we are seemingly powerless to stop it. Until those who own estates are held to account for what happens on their land, I am afraid history may repeat itself and we may once again see our largest bird of prey silently slip into extinction.

2/16/2022,"Written by Julian Fellowes, who brought us Downton Abbey and recent series The Gilded Age, and directed by Michael Engler, who worked on both the aforementioned, this based-extremely-loosely-on-fact costume drama adapted from a novel by Laura Moriarty should hit the sweet spot for fans of Fellowes’ particular variety of saucy-soapy period pieces. Like so much of Fellowes’ work, it effectively flatters the viewer by assuming he or she must be familiar with certain historical figures (in this case, early cinema star Louise Brooks) and then appears to dish the dirt on them through the eyes of a character from another class or at least different social sphere. Here, that parallax view is from the perspective of Norma – played by Lady Grantham herself, Elizabeth McGovern, taking a lead role for a change. When first met in 1922 in Wichita, Kansas, Norma seems like a nice, churchgoing lady of a certain age, respectably married to a lawyer (Campbell Scott) and mother of two practically grownup sons. When she hears that local pianist Myra Brooks (Victoria Hill) is in search of a chaperone to accompany her precocious but exceedingly talented teenage daughter Louise (Haley Lu Richardson) to New York to attend a prestigious dance school, Norma mysteriously jumps at the chance. Turns out she has a good reason: she was actually raised in an orphanage there for a short while before being adopted by kindly midwestern farmers, and now wants to find her birth parents.  However, Louise is a bit of a handful, as anyone who knows a bit about the real Louise Brooks would be aware. Beyond the plot frame of the film, she went on to become a actor in such films as Pandora’s Box (1929), as well as a hot mess later in life, but at this stage she’s just a headstrong, naturally unconventional kid with incandescent talent and huge ambition. Turns out the chaperoning gig is harder than it looks; Louise is forever sneaking off to do whatever she wants. Richardson has a super-silky, immaculately-cut black bob to fill in playing a character as iconic as Brooks; otherwise she is about 80% there in terms of charisma and dancing skills, and around 70% when it comes to the sex appeal and feral intelligence – but in truth it would be a challenge for anyone. McGovern holds her own gracefully, especially when Norma discovers a side to herself she didn’t know was there when she meets a handsome German handyman (Géza Röhrig) at her old orphanage, a sensitive arthouse stud-monkey if ever there was one. All the corny romance stuff is about as intrinsic to the film’s soft appeal as the scrupulously well-made frocks, encompassing late Edwardian lace and flapper-style dropwaist numbers, and dozens of well-turned cloche hats.  The Chaperone is released on 21 February on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Chaperone review – dishing dirt in well-turned hats and hair,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/15/the-chaperone-review-julian-fellowes-louise-brooks
2/16/2022,"The footballer Emiliano Sala was put under pressure to complete his multimillion-pound transfer to the Premier League before he died in a plane crash as he headed to his new club, an inquest jury has been told. Sala’s mother, Mercedes Taffarel, said the weeks before the private plane he was in crashed into the Channel as he travelled from Nantes in France to join Cardiff City seemed “very intense”.  “Cardiff put on a lot of pressure on him to complete the sale quickly, but Nantes asked for more money and Emi felt in the middle of the dispute,” she said. “Emi was in some doubt to go ahead with the move. Finally, the sale was agreed, not because of his performances as a player at Nantes, which were very good, but because Nantes needed the money.” The Argentina-born striker was joining the then Premier League club from the French Ligue 1 side Nantes in a £15m deal. Dorset coroner’s court heard that the 28-year-old died when the plane crashed close to Guernsey on 21 January 2019. The body of the pilot, David Ibbotson, has never been found. On the first day of the inquest, Sala’s mother told the court that her son’s dream since childhood in Argentina had been to become a professional footballer. When she first took him to play, the family could not afford to buy him football boots so he trained in trainers, but he loved the game and thrived. In a written statement, Taffarel said his goalscoring exploits in France led to calls for him to be called up to Argentina’s national team. “He appreciated the Nantes club and the fans very much,” she said. “An offer came in from Cardiff City in December 2018. It is true to say that Emi was very happy when he eventually accepted the idea of the move as he had the chance to play in the Premier League. “He felt it was the right time to move clubs and to another league. It seemed to him that the Nantes management was also pushing his exit from the club because they were going through some financial problems. Emi’s transfer was the most expensive in history of the club and that also helped to push forward his transfer, even though the team coach didn’t want him to leave the club.” Taffarel said she spoke to her son regularly, and when she did not hear from him on the day of the flight she assumed he had gone to bed early after arriving in Wales. The following day she learned that the plane was missing. Relatives travelled to Guernsey. “In the cold weather we walked on those islands calling his name, hoping to hear from him,” she said. Taffarel spoke of the family’s trauma when the official search was eventually called off. “It was extremely distressing. We didn’t hesitate to hire a private team to continue.” The plane was located with Sala’s body inside. She said: “No one can bring Emi back to us, but we ask for justice so that Emi can rest in peace and give us a little bit of peace of mind knowing that we did everything we could so similar deaths are prevented in the future.” The inquest, which is taking place at the town hall in Bournemouth, is due to last about five weeks.",Sport/Football,"Emiliano Sala was put under pressure before plane crash death, inquest hears",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/emiliano-sala-under-pressure-before-plane-crash-inquest-hears
2/16/2022,"My grandfather Brian Bennett, who has died aged 84, was an old-fashioned socialist. His socialism was built not on books and theories, but on the sacrifices and struggle of making a better life for his family. Growing up hungry was something that he carried with him for life, whether in never letting anybody in his company leave a crumb on their plate or giving anyone who needed it a lift home, a hot meal or the last tenner in his wallet. All his life Brian lived within a few miles of Atherton, where he was born into the dire poverty of a Lancashire mining village in the 1930s. Even by the standards of the time, his childhood was not an easy one. His mother, Nancy (nee Farrimond), died when he was seven, and rheumatic fever almost killed him before he reached his teens. But it was that illness that saved Brian from following his father, Tom, and his brothers, Tom and Jack, down the pit when he left the local school. Instead, he got a job with the Royal London, cycling round the small towns and villages that had grown out of the coalfields between Bolton and Leigh collecting insurance premiums.  Brian met Margaret Lambert when she was working in the offices of Lancashire United Transport. They married in 1961 and moved into a two-up two-down in Atherton. It was their hard graft – with Margaret taking office jobs doing payroll – that sent their children, Dawn and Martin, off to university, later followed by their grandchildren. An infectious sense of humour and a warmth filled every room that Brian entered. He played the lottery each week but lived as though he already had the winning ticket in his pocket, walking down the street with a twinkle in his eye, whistling a tune and cracking jokes. He taught us that life is always better outside with the sun on your face and the wind in your hair; that there is no day that cannot be improved by a cup of tea and a long walk; that an afternoon whiled away at the cricket is the height of human progress. He worked to live and took early retirement at 60 to dedicate his later years to his family, becoming a father figure to me and my sisters, Alice and Clare, after our own father left. Brian’s life’s work was marked by the quiet dignity and daily declaration of love that is the building of a life for your family and then being able to share it with them and watch them enjoy it.

2/16/2022,"A Black Lives Matter group in south Wales has closed down after revelations that a covert police unit attempted to recruit one of its members to be an informant. The Swansea BLM group said it had decided to dissolve itself for a number of reasons, including the attempted recruitment by the police and threats to its members’ physical and mental safety from far-right activists.  Lowri Davies, one of the group’s main organisers, exposed a covert police operation to persuade her to become an informant last year by secretly recording the approach. It was the first public evidence that the police have sought to enlist a mole within the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK. On Tuesday, Davies said the attempt by South Wales police to recruit her had had “a massive impact” on the group, leading to members drifting away. She said supporters were too scared to join, adding: “It felt like we were fighting against the odds.” In a statement, BLM Swansea said: “While we have found that our organisation has done some important work, we have been subject to an attempt of infiltration at the hands of South Wales police” and harassment by far-right activists who have visited the homes of supporters and published its members’ personal information online. The group added: “Swansea has proven to be a tricky place to mobilise, and we have found it difficult to find volunteers and a considerable amount of our members left (understandably so) when South Wales police attempted their infiltration.” “We’ve had a great year and a half of organising but it’s time to dissolve our organisation, a decision which has been further cemented by the lack of community within organising spaces.” The group, which had about seven core members and hundreds of supporters online, was set up after the murder of George Floyd in the US by a white police officer in 2020. The group supported local campaigns against alleged police brutality and racism. Last March, Davies, a Swansea University law student, secretly recorded calls from one of the covert police officers seeking to persuade her to become an informant. She shared the recording with the Guardian to raise awareness of what she says were “distressing” techniques used to try to manipulate her into supplying information to the police. South Wales police said they neither confirmed nor denied any specific details, adding: “A complaint was received which refers to contact made by a covert officer. This is currently being investigated and therefore it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.” The Network for Police Monitoring, a civil liberties group, said: “Police attempts to recruit informers in activist groups is about disruption as much as gathering intelligence and it takes its toll on campaigners’ morale.”",News/UK news,British BLM group closes down after police infiltration attempt,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/swansea-black-lives-matter-british-blm-group-closes-down-after-police-infiltration-attempt
2/16/2022,"Pam & Tommy, the Hulu series on the story behind the most infamous sex tape of the 1990s, is disconcertingly fun. The eight-part series created by Robert Siegel, half of which has aired, is front-loaded with 90s iconography and zany gags designed to provoke online discussion. There’s the brain-scrambling transformations of actors Lily James and Sebastian Stan into mid-90s rock it-couple Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee, and a mulleted Seth Rogen as Rand Gauthier, the stiffed carpenter who pulls off an impressive heist of the couple’s safe, played for suspense. There’s nostalgic needle drops from Nine Inch Nails to Fatboy Slim, a conversation between a high Tommy and his animatronic penis, and plenty of sex, drugs, videotapes and characters asking, with winking naivety, what the world wide web is.  It’s a confusing, often entertaining watch, one that wants to have its fun and interrogate it, too, at best a heady blend of screwball comedy, madcap romance, expensive nostalgia and serious retrospective of a public scandal in which a woman’s privacy was invaded, her intimate moments exploited and judged without her consent. But there’s one detail that, for me, turns this whole palate sour: the real Pamela Anderson did not want this story retold. While Stan has confirmed that he spoke with Lee, who has praised his portrayal, Anderson did not respond to producers’ overtures. She has not spoken publicly about the series, but sources have expressed her discontent and disappointment in multiple outlets. Anderson’s reticence looms over everything. In one standout scene from the fourth episode, time ceases to pass as Pam overhears Baywatch crew watching the tape and realizes that it’s her voice, that it’s her tape, that strangers are watching her private video. James’s performance of paralyzing dread is excellent, her slow-burn horror palpable, chilling. But, for me, it’s inseparable from the off-screen context. Are we not repeating that horror now? Pam & Tommy recreates parts of the tape, has actors mimic Anderson and Lee’s sex noises, includes montages of them having cartoonishly vigorous sex, uses prosthetics to imitate their famous anatomies. It’s deliberately uncomfortable to watch, and while there’s a lot going on here, much of it interesting and admirable, not all discomfort is productive. No amount of impersonation, or sympathetic portrayals in which Pam clearly recognizes the biases against her, can get me past the fact that a show about consent exists without the consent of one of its central subjects. It’s not without trying; the show’s sympathies clearly lie with Anderson, especially in later episodes yet to air that depict how the slut-shaming fallout from the tape’s (illegal!) release was particularly hellacious for her. The showrunners and cast have been straightforward about their desire to do right by her – “We particularly wanted to let Pamela Anderson know that this portrayal was very much a positive thing and that we cared a great deal about her and wanted her to know that the show loves her,” showrunner DV DeVincentis told Entertainment Weekly of attempts to work with her. “We didn’t get a response, but considering what she’s been through and the time that we were reaching out, that was understandable.” I get that. TV is a collaborative project that shouldn’t necessarily hinge on the feelings of one person. Nor is a subject’s narrative control and participation necessarily the best recipe for clarity, honesty, even empathy – see: most pop-star documentaries, which essentially function as long-form PR, such as Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana. But Anderson’s lack of interest in revisiting a foundational public trauma, one that reportedly remains “very painful” for her, undermines the whole project. It invades every scene, particularly in the mid-season stretch in which Pam and Tommy begin to realize the extent of the tape’s dispersal. It turns otherwise potent, provocative material – on the boundaries of privacy, the unforgiving binds of sex appeal, the double standards of public exposure – a shade queasy. Hulu could tell this story with or without Anderson’s permission or cooperation because it obtained the rights to the 2014 Rolling Stone article by Amanda Chicago Lewis about the story behind the theft of the tape by Gauthier – a relatively long example of the viral article to streaming content pipeline that, by 2022, is at full gush. Contemporaneous to Pam & Tommy, which adapts a mid-2010s gonzo retelling of a 90s nostalgia trap, is Inventing Anna, the Shonda Rhimes series on the viral article by Jessica Pressler about faux heiress Anna Delvey, which premiered last week on Netflix; Super Pumped, the Showtime series on Uber, based on reporting by Mike Isaac; and The Dropout, a series starring Amanda Seyfried as Silicon Valley fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. On the film side, there’s 2019’s Hustlers, also based on a Jessica Pressler article about savvy strippers in recession-era New York, and last year’s Zola, based on a viral 2014 tweet-thread-cum-story by A’Ziah “Zola” King. But Pam & Tommy, as a depiction of how Anderson’s trauma was dismissed or compounded by those around her, including Lee, at the time of the tape’s theft and release, has more in common with feminist retrospectives on how the “post-feminist” media and mores of the 90s and 2000s treated public-facing women: documentaries re-examining the harsh media lacerations of Britney Spears, Janet Jackson and Lorena Bobbitt, the Showtime hit Yellowjackets, and most strikingly Impeachment: American Crime Story. Monica Lewinsky served as a producer on the FX series, advising the portrayal of her character, played by Beanie Feldstein. It’s fair to ask if this show should exist in the first place, if there are limits for a media retrospective, even revision, packaged as entertainment. To be fair, Pam & Tommy is partly undercut by its release format – the first three episodes, which orbit around Gauthier as a pathetic, sympathetically put-upon figure and retell Anderson and Lee’s pairing as a romp, belie a more considerate and skewering back half of the season yet to air. A brutal deposition scene in the sixth episode, directed by A Teacher’s Hannah Fidell, in which old, white, male lawyers prod her memories for sport (“Was that exciting for you and your husband?” one asks of the tape) is particularly squirm-inducing, evocative and devastating. But this insight is ultimately shortchanged by its provenance, the knowledge that the person at hand again didn’t invite this public scrutiny. “I feel so violated,” says Pam in the fourth episode, hands over her face, tape now in the hands of the nascent internet. Pam & Tommy, for all its hijinks, remains clear-eyed on just how traumatic and unfair that violation was. But without Anderson, the cycle of attention – this series, this piece, our watching it – also seems to extend it.",Arts/Television & radio,Exploiting the exploited: the problem with Pam & Tommy,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/15/pam-and-tommy-hulu-series-pamela-anderson-consent
