4/25/2022,"On the campaign trail in Denain, one of the poorest towns in France, Emmanuel Macron walked into a crowd of voters to “take the pulse of the nation” and a woman pushed forward to sum up the mood. “We’re living in misery,” she said. Others shouted: “This country doesn’t work” and “We’ve had enough”. When one father described not managing to make ends meet, Macron said: “That’s what I’m fighting for.” The man shot back: “That’s not the impression I have.” Macron, a young, former banker, who had loosened labour laws and promised the biggest overhaul of the French welfare state since the war, was lauded internationally for making France a “star economic performer” of the pandemic era – growth had bounced back faster than expected from the Covid crisis, unemployment was at its lowest level for more than a decade, and government caps on gas and electricity prices kept French prices from rising as fast as those in European neighbours. But, as Macron got up close to voters in town squares across France in the past two weeks – keen to compensate for a persistent image as haughty and cut off from everyday concerns – he realised that the cost of living crisis and people’s very real fears of making ends meet would play a greater role than he had anticipated in the campaign. His economic statistics on paper did not match everyone’s felt experience on the ground. Six months earlier, the far right’s Marine Le Pen had foreseen that workers on low and middle incomes felt they weren’t being heard or understood. She styled herself as “the candidate of a France that is suffering” and went under the radar across the countryside to listen to them. In the final two weeks of the campaign, Macron tried to catch up by shaking hands and explaining his economic record, arguing that this was the first election in decades in which France’s mass unemployment was not the central theme, because he had boosted job creation. But he found, by his own admission, “people who don’t feel they’re being taken into consideration, who feel resentment … who feel humiliated or looked down upon”. He said: “I try to listen in an objective way.” He accepted that if he were to win re-election, things must be done “more simply, more directly”. He said: “We have to reconcile the working class with politicians.” During the campaign, Macron conceded that if the French far right had risen to its highest ever levels in the presidential first round – with Le Pen and the newcomer TV pundit Éric Zemmour taking more than 30% – it was because he himself “had not managed to calm a certain anger”. That anger will certainly be one of the main challenges in the next five year presidential term. The gilets jaunes anti-government protests in 2018 and 2019 had shown that people’s sense of injustice could spontaneously erupt into a large scale and long running protest movement that was not contained by traditional trade unions or defined by political voting patterns, but which pushed people to demonstrate every Saturday for months on end. Some in Macron’s government had initially felt this year’s election would play out along the lines of moderation, “reason” and science versus the “hatred and division” of populists. But it became clear in the final weeks of the presidential campaign that “rationality” was not enough: there needed to be an emotional connection to people’s everyday lives. Le Pen attacked Macron as “power without empathy”. His brilliance at number-crunching and his professorial explanations of the efficiency of his policies were seen by some as technocratic abstraction. Macron accepted in the final days of the campaign that only getting level to French people’s lived experience and emotional feeling would work. “I’m very conscious of the precariousness, of the fragility, that you can lose everything,” he said of people who were struggling. Macron said he had picked up on the signs of “trauma” in a society where more than 140,000 lives were lost to Covid, and where voters’ main worries were making ends meet, followed by the war in Ukraine and concerns about the climate crisis. “It’s the first time that even children have stopped me in crowds to ask me about the war in Ukraine,” he said, shocked, in the final days before the vote. A 72-year-old former elected official in a village in the Oise, where a majority had voted Le Pen, said: “People’s mood can be summed up in one word: uncertainty. Uncertainty over health, over part-time job contracts, over how much you’ll be overdrawn by the end of the month. Uncertainty over the prospect of nuclear war, and the planet burning.” Against this backdrop of doubt towards the political class, Macron accepted that the country was fractured and divided. The immediate challenge is how a sense of unity can begin to be knitted back together and what form the parliament will take in June. Analysts now carve French politics into three blocs. Macron is holding together a broad centrist bloc, which five years ago spread from voters on the social-democratic left to the centre right, and this time moved more to the right to take voters from Nicolas Sarkozy’s old party of government. Then there is a far-right bloc – including not just Le Pen but the newcomer Zemmour, whose inflammatory anti-immigration rhetoric and warnings of society at war have left a lasting trace on the political debate. Finally, there is a bloc on the more radical left, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, which is increasingly tapping into concerns over ecology and the environment. But signs of disillusionment with politics persist, including the millions of voters who did not turn out at the ballot box. Analysis by the academics William Genieys and Saïd Darviche found that more than 61% of French voters chose candidates in the first round whose message was “anti-elite” – including theLe Pen and Mélenchon, and many smaller figures, who had all argued that traditional political elites were stopping equality and hampering real democracy. Macron argued that he could unite France “in the important moments”, such as the Covid crisis. He promised a new method of politics to take broader points of view into account. On the last day of the campaign, he promised “to find a path and the reasons to make us live as a nation united”. His political opponents said they would hold him to the challenge.",News/World news,Macron’s appeal to unity succeeds but far right makes strong showing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/macrons-appeal-to-unity-succeeds-but-far-right-makes-strong-showing
4/25/2022,"Outside Zaporizhzhia there are several lines of deep trenches, ringed by sandbags, armed men, and more sandbags and armed men. But life in the city is surprisingly normal – even busy – for wartime Ukraine. As the only large city in south-east Ukraine under Ukrainian control, Zaporizhzhia has become a destination for the hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russian occupation. With 70% of the wider Zaporizhzhia region under Russian military control, there are fears, however, that Moscow’s forces will attempt to take it. Ukrainian reinforcements are moving towards the city and active fighting has begun in earnest. Ukrainian soldiers told the Guardian they had recently retreated from one town in the Zaporizhzhia region. Villages and towns about an hour’s drive from the city that were visited by journalists three weeks ago are no longer safe, according to the regional military administration. “You can see for yourself people are out, going to work – the city is prepared but it won’t come to that,” said Ivan Ariefiev, the press secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, at one of a series of war-related training courses being offered to the city’s teachers and journalists. Attenders, who are then expected to train the wider community, were taught how to load a gun, administer first aid and do a basic medical evaluation. Despite the proximity of Russian troops, Ariefiev said, the regional military command was confident it could keep Russian forces at bay. “No one is being evacuated from the city itself,” said Ariefiev. “It’s only the evacuees from the south who are leaving for other places.” In the newly dug maze of trenches outside Zaporizhzhia, the Guardian heard frequent incoming shells that soldiers said were landing 3km to 5km away. The group of soldiers who dug the trenches said they hoped these lines of defence would never be used and that Ukrainian soldiers farther south would withstand the attacks. The soldiers who were not on the frontlines said they had a fraction of the medical and protective equipment they needed. For the whole platoon, they had just six tourniquets – a first aid essential that prevents blood loss. When asked if they thought the Russians would advance soon, they would only say they expected to fight. “We just need arms from our western comrades and we’ll do it. The [Russians] have too much old Soviet equipment,” the platoon commander said. “In case you hadn’t noticed, they reached Kharkiv, Kyiv, encircled Sumy and Chernihiv – four huge regions – and we kicked them out. They were considered a powerful army, but we pissed on them.” The previous day there had been a double rocket strike by Russian forces. The city has been hit infrequently compared with other eastern Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or towns in the Donbas. Some of the eight people wounded by the rocket attack were rushed to Zaporizhzhia military hospital, which occasionally takes civilians as well as soldiers. According to the military press secretary for the hospital, Nikita, a former IT manager who joined up days after the invasion, none of the rocket strikes hit their targets, instead been caught by anti-aircraft systems, lessening the impact. “If they had hit as intended, we would have seen many, many more wounded,” Nikita said. The head surgeon at the hospital said they were coping with the wounded but were working 24/7. He said he had been home only twice since the war started, and had been called back in almost immediately. Despite the relative safety the city’s defences offer, some of those who have arrived from Russian-occupied areas want to return home. The Guardian met one woman among a crowd of people in a car park on the outskirts of the city normally used to receive convoys from Russian-occupied territory. Iryna was part of a group of about 400 people who wanted to return to Berdyansk, a city in southern Zaporizhzhia takenby Russian forces at the beginning of March. “We’re Ukrainians, we want to be part of Ukraine, but you have to understand my mother is bedridden and almost out of insulin,” Iryna said. “I came here last week to buy Pampers and medicine [for her] because in Berdyansk there’s nothing.” But the Ukrainian authorities said they could not let the group leave Zaporizhzhia because of heavy fighting on the roads. Iryna rang her husband, Vitaly, who had stayed in Berdyansk. He said over the phone that Iryna’s mother had a matter of days left to live. For six days in a row the Berdyansk residents – who have clubbed together in the hope that it will make their passage safer – have come to the car park from the temporary accommodation offered to evacuees and waited for permission to leave. The drivers of the coaches and minibuses are themselves from Berdyansk, and have helped to evacuate people from there and from neighbouring cities including Mariupol. They too are eager to leave as they plan to pick more up evacuees at the other end. “I don’t care if it’s dangerous, just let us go,” Iryna said to a representative of the Ukrainian military, who was surrounded by other women, a few of whom also said they were going back to look after bedridden relatives. The military representative told the women that she could not risk letting them travel because of shelling on the roads. A family with small children from near Volnovakha, a city in the Donetsk region also under Russian occupation, said they were hitching a lift with the Berdyansk convoy and planned to find other transport from there to take them home, another 150km away. “We’ve run out of money. Of course we don’t want to live under occupation, but we can’t sleep in a shelter any more,” said Vlad, holding his three-year-old son in his arms. He said they had been in Zaporizhzhia for a week. “It would cost us 300 hryvnia (£8) a night to rent a flat. That’s not realistic.” He added: “The volunteers have been just super but there’s no work here. At least there we have a small allotment and we’ll be with our parents.” *Some names have been changed to protect people who may travel into areas Russian occupied areas of Ukraine.",News/World news,Fortress Zaporizhzhia prepares to fight as war closes in ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/fortress-zaporizhzhia-prepares-to-fight-as-war-closes-in
4/25/2022,"Labor has hit back at Peter Dutton’s claim that the only way to “preserve peace is to prepare for war”, suggesting the Coalition’s actions fall short of its words. The defence minister made the comments on Anzac Day morning, warning that “people like Hitler” are not “consigned to history” and Australia must do more to stand up to China’s aggression in the region. China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands has injected national security as a central issue of the federal election campaign, with Labor declaring it the worst foreign policy failure since the second world war. On Monday, Scott Morrison said that Australia shares the same “red line” as the US and that a Chinese base in the south Pacific would be unacceptable, but did not spell out what Australia would do if this occurred. The prime minister told the Anzac Day service in Darwin that an “arc of autocracy” is challenging the international rules-based order, citing war in Europe and “coercion” in the Indo-Pacific region. Dutton told Channel Nine’s Today the comments reflect “the reality of our time”, and the past sacrifices of the Anzacs in conflicts will not “see us through to eternity without conflict in our region”. “We have to be realistic that people like Hitler and others aren’t just a figment of our imagination or that they’re consigned to history. “We have, [in Russian] president Putin at the moment, somebody who is willing to kill women and children. That’s happening in the year 2022.” Without wanting to “overegg” the threat, Dutton claimed that China was “on a very deliberate course at the moment”. “We have to stand up with countries to stare down any act of aggression … to make sure we can keep peace in our region and for our country.” “The only way you can preserve peace is to prepare for war and be strong as a country. Not to be on bended knee and be weak.” Responding to suggestions that the claim was provocative, Dutton said it was “the lesson of history” and believing past sacrifices were enough would cause us to “repeat the mistakes of history”. “We’re in a period very similar to the 1930s now and I think there were a lot of people in the 1930s who wish they had spoken up much earlier into the decade.” Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, responded that “we certainly need to prepare, but we have not seen the preparation under this government”. “Words are one thing, action is another,” he told reporters in Darwin. “This is a government which beats its chest. “When it comes to actually delivering, and doing what needs to be done, it’s a government which repeatedly fails.” Marles cited the fact Australia has had six defence ministers in nine years and argued that failures in management of procuring submarines had opened up a 20-year capability gap. “This is a government which repeatedly fails as it has in its management of relationships in the Pacific, as it has in terms of the [sale of the] Darwin port.” In September, the Coalition announced a $90bn defence pact with the US and UK to include purchase of nuclear submarines. The decision to tear up a contract to buy conventional submarines from France’s Naval Group at a cost of up to $5.5bn prompted concerns of a capability gap with Collins-class submarines to be in use until 2050. On Monday Labor announced if elected it would spend $520m to boost veterans’ support, including clearing a backlog of 60,000 unresolved claims for payments. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, told Radio National that Labor had “grave concerns” if China established a naval base in Solomon Islands. O’Connor said Morrison’s “post-facto rhetoric” about red lines was a “reactive” approach when what was needed was “better investment, better engagement in the region”. “Given the change in tone and rhetoric used by the prime minister … We will seek a briefing from the prime minister.” Dutton’s comments on Monday echo a controversial speech last Anzac day by the secretary of the home affairs department, Michael Pezzullo, warning that “the drums of war beat … [at] times more loudly and ever closer”. Pezzullo suggested Australia must be prepared to “send off, yet again, our warriors to fight the nation’s wars” if it cannot secure peace. In 2019, the Liberal MP and then chair of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, Andrew Hastie, compared the west’s attitude to China to France’s inadequate defences against Nazi Germany.",News/Australia news,‘We have not seen the preparation’: Labor attacks Coalition after Dutton’s declaration on war,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/25/we-have-not-seen-the-preparation-labor-attacks-coalition-after-peter-duttons-declaration-on-war
4/25/2022,"Russian forces continued heavy shelling of Ukrainian cities on Sunday as people in both countries observed Orthodox Easter and the US secretaries of state and defence made their first visit to Kyiv since the invasion. Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin arrived in Kyiv and were holding talks with the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Zelenskiy, said on Sunday in a social media video. Ukrainian officials plan to tell Blinken and Austin of the immediate need for more weapons, including anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, Zelenskiy aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday. The request will come as the conflict ratchets up. The Russian military reported hitting 423 Ukrainian targets overnight, including fortified positions and troop concentrations, while its warplanes destroyed 26 Ukrainian military sites, including an explosives factory and several artillery depots. Most of the Easter fighting focused on the eastern Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are concentrated and where Moscow-backed separatists controlled some territory before the war. “The Russian army continued to actively shell peaceful cities in Ukraine and kill civilians,” said Lyudmila Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament’s human rights ombudsman. She said Russian strikes killed four civilians in the Donetsk region and eight in the Luhansk region. “Three people working in a garden in Zaporizhzhia were killed by Russian artillery on Saturday,” Denisova said. According to Ukraine’s national police, two girls aged five and 14 died in shelling in the town of Ocheretyne, part of the industrial region. Russia’s forces continued to strike the city of Kharkiv, injuring three police officers and one woman, while artillery killed two men in the village of Slatyne, in Kharkiv region. Moscow’s forces launched fresh airstrikes on a Mariupol steel plant where up to 1,000 civilians are holed up along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine’s 36th marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker posted on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments. “We are taking casualties, the situation is critical … we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it’s a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines … the situation is rapidly worsening,” Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant. The UN’s Ukraine crisis coordinator, Amin Awad, called for an “immediate stop” to fighting in Mariupol to allow the evacuation of trapped civilians from the battered city. “The lives of tens of thousands, including women, children and older people, are at stake in Mariupol,” Awad said. “We need a pause in fighting right now to save lives.” An adviser to the Ukrainian president said on Sunday that Ukraine had invited Russia to talks near the Mariupol steel plant. “We invited Russians to hold a special round of talks on the spot right next to the walls of Azovstal,” said Oleksiy Arestovych. Earlier in the day, Kyiv had called for a truce in battered Mariupol for Orthodox Easter, celebrated in both Russia and Ukraine. Even as fighting raged across the country, a military position in the eastern town of Lyman, on the frontline, took time to observe a solemn Easter, trading the usual patriotic salutation of “Glory to Ukraine!” for the ritual “Christ has risen!”. “Truly risen!” came the reply. In the town’s small Orthodox church, about 50 civilians braved possible mortar fire to gather to pray from dawn. Ukrainians meanwhile shared tributes to a journalist, Valeria Glodan, and her three-month-old daughter who were among eight people killed in missile attacks on the southern port of Odesa on Saturday. Glodan had posted on Instagram immediately before the invasion of her joy at the arrival of her baby girl. “These were the best 40 weeks ever,” she wrote on Twitter 11 weeks ago. “Our girl is one month old now. Daddy got her first flowers. It’s a whole new level of happiness.” On Sunday her husband, Yury Glodan, shared a heartbreaking tribute to his wife and daughter. “My dear ones, the kingdom of heaven! You are in our hearts,” he wrote on social media. Zelenskiy spoke angrily about the death of the baby during a press conference on Saturday night in a Kyiv underground metro station. “Try to grasp it,” he said. “The war started when the child was a month old. These are pure bastards. They are monsters. It’s horrifying. They don’t care.” A future war crimes tribunal would mete out justice against Russia’s leaders, he added. Zelenskiy announced he would meet the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, in Kyiv on Sunday. The White House declined to comment. It would be the first high-level US trip to Kyiv since the war began 24 February. The visit by Blinken and Austin will come at a symbolic moment, as the war enters its third month, and with fierce battles continuing in the country’s east. Zelenskiy aide Igor Zhovkva told NBC News on Sunday that Ukrainian officials intended to tell Blinken and Austin of the immediate need for more weapons, including anti-missile systems, anti-aircraft systems, armoured vehicles and tanks, The United States and Nato allies have shown growing readiness to supply heavier equipment and more advanced weapons systems. Britain has promised to send military vehicles and is considering supplying British tanks to Poland to free up Warsaw’s Russian-designed T-72s for Ukraine. Zelenskiy gave little detail about the logistics but said he expected concrete results – “not just presents or some kind of cakes, we are expecting specific things and specific weapons”. On Sunday in a video message from Kyiv’s ancient St Sophia Cathedral, Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, highlighted the significance of Easter, the highest point in the Orthodox calendar. “The great holiday today gives us great hope and unwavering faith that light will overcome darkness, good will overcome evil, life will overcome death, and therefore Ukraine will surely win,” he said.
