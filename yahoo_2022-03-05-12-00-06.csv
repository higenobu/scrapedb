3/5/2022,"A man charged with hate crimes after allegedly assaulting seven Asian women in Manhattan on Sunday has struggled with mental health issues for years, according to his mother.

Steven Zajonc, 28, was arrested on Wednesday evening in connection with the unprovoked assaults, which all took place in a span of just two hours. Police said he punched, elbowed or shoved his victims, two of whom were hospitalized.

He was charged with seven counts of assault and attempted assault, which have all been classified as hate crimes. He was also charged with seven counts of aggravated harassment and harassment.

Zajonc, who is believed to be homeless, is originally from New York. But he lived in Florida with his mother up until 2020, when they parted ways following a “domestic incident”.
 


On Thursday, Zajonc’s mother spoke with local news program “8 On Your Side” and revealed that her son has battled mental health issues for several years. Court records reportedly show that she herself had petitioned a no-contact order against him in 2020 after he “threatened to kill” her.

While he lived in Florida, Zajonc was committed under the state’s Mental Health Act multiple times, his mother said. The law, also known as the Baker Act, allows people who pose a risk of harm themselves or others to be held involuntarily at an approved treatment facility for up to 72 hours.

Zajonc is also an Army vet, having served as a private between February 2015 and March 2016, according to the Daily Mail. A spokesperson told the outlet, however, that he was never deployed, and it is unknown why he left the military.

Zajonc’s mother believes her son was having an “episode” during Sunday’s attacks. It remains unknown why he targeted Asian women, but his mother claimed that he appreciated Asian culture and had wanted to learn how to speak Japanese.

Zajonc’s youngest victim was a 19-year-old college student. He allegedly elbowed her in the face at around 7:05 p.m. near Union Square East and East 17th Street.

The victim, who was still bleeding from her mouth by Tuesday, told PIX11 that she felt “helpless” after the assault.

“I think it’s terrible, he should be arrested,” she said.

Sunday’s assault spree came less than a week after 61-year-old Guiying Ma died as a result of another anti-Asian attack last November. Ma was the fourth Asian victim in New York City to have died as a result of a violent attack in the last two months, following Yao Pan Ma, Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee.

Zajonc’s mother told “8 On Your Side” that her son would never hurt anyone “in his right mind.” She said she would like to send her deepest apologies to his victims.

3/5/2022,"Ukrainian women are being raped by Russian soldiers, it has been claimed. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, spoke of “numerous cases” of sexual violence in the week since Vladimir Putin launched an all-out assault. Kuleba welcomed a call to create a special tribunal to punish Putin, but added it was “difficult” to talk about international law amid the country’s current suffering. “When bombs fall on your cities, when soldiers rape women in the occupied cities – and we have numerous cases of, unfortunately, when Russian soldiers rape women in Ukrainian cities – it’s difficult of course to speak about the efficiency of the international law,"" Kuleba told an online event organised by the Chatham House think-tank. “This is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us to make sure that, in the end, eventually, all those who made this war possible will be brought to justice and the Russian Federation, as a country that committed an act of aggression, will also be held accountable for its deeds.” Kuleba's claims have not been independently verified. Read more: The Kremlin ordered 400 Russian mercenaries in Kyiv to hunt and kill Ukraine's president, report says Putin's forces have made a limited progress in the eight days since they breached Ukrainian borders, and captured only one Ukrainian city – the southern Dnipro River port of Kherson. Instead of a swift invasion, Putin is now personally responsible for over a million refugees who have fled Ukraine into their neighbouring European countries. Those who have already left make up around 2% of the population. The United Nations have estimated as many as four million people will eventually have to flee their homes. Before launching his invasion, Putin claimed to be doing it to ""denazify"" Ukraine. In the days since he has launched an all out assault on the Ukrainian people and their homes, bombing cities, hospitals and Holocaust memorials as he tries to beat them into submission. Watch: Russia seizes Europe's largest nuclear power plant after attack on Ukraine The Ukrainians have put up a fiercer fight than Putin anticipated, making his force's advances slower and losses heavier. On Wednesday, Russia admitted for the first time admitted its soldiers had been killed, saying in a statement 498 of its troops had died. The UK has the death toll will be “considerably higher” than figures released by the Kremlin. Ukraine claims over 9,000 Russian troops have died since the invasion began, although this figure is unverified. In other developments: Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has said Russia is using cluster bombs in Ukraine. ""We have seen the use of cluster bombs and we have seen reports of use of other types of weapons which would be in violation of international law,"" he told reporters in Brussels. Stoltenberg further warned that ""the worst is yet to come"" in the conflict. Ukraine's demands for a no-fly zone were once again rejected by Nato allies, citing fears the move could spiral into all-out war between Russia and the West. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if allies wouldn't meet his request to protect his nation's air space, they should instead provide Kyiv with more war planes. A huge fire was put out at a nuclear power plant in southeast Ukraine after it was seized by Russian forces. No damage was done to reactors at the Zaporozhzhia plant after a projectile hit a nearby building, UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi said. Boris Johnson accused Putin of “directly threatening the safety of all of Europe” after the attack on the plant. Russia's parliament passed a low imposing jail sentences of up to 15 years for people who spread ""fake information"" about the country's armed forces. The laws give the Russian state enhanced powers to crack down on dissenters. Russia's communications watchdog also restricted access to several foreign news organisations' websites, including the BBC and Deutsche Welle.",News/Yahoo News UK,"Russian soldiers are raping our women, Ukraine's foreign minister warns",https://news.yahoo.com/invading-russian-soldiers-are-raping-women-in-ukraine-foreign-minister-warns-130724653.html
