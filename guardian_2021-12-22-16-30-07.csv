12/22/2021,"Scott Morrison insists it’s not necessary for the states to introduce mask mandates in response to a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, despite health advice recommending they be compulsory in indoor settings.  Speaking after a national cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the prime minister instead said it was “highly recommended” to wear masks indoors, urging Australians to use common sense and to reduce their risk of spreading Covid to their loved ones over Christmas. Health advice circulated to state and territory leaders late last week made the case for mandating masks in all indoor settings, including retail, entertainment facilities, and hospitality when not eating and drinking. “Implementation of mask wearing measures should occur prior to Omicron case escalation to have maximum benefit,” said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) advice. But after the unscheduled meeting with states and territory leaders Morrison called for a “greater level of self-regulation” as he brushed off the idea of explicitly calling on the states and territories to mandate masks. The premiers would make their own decisions about how best to promote mask usage, Morrison said, adding that some leaders “like to use mandates” and others “rely on the individual responsibility to achieve that”. The emphasis on personal responsibility echoes the language used by the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, who has defended the decision to recently relax mask mandates. NSW reported a record high 3,763 new Covid cases on Wednesday, and Victoria 1,503. “What matters is that people wear them, not whether people get fined,” Morrison said. Morrison urged Australians to “think of the person sitting on the other side of the table” and to wear a mask in indoor settings. “Think of the person you’re going to meet this weekend. Think of Christmas Day where you’ll see elderly relatives, and wear a mask. It’s pretty simple. And so I would encourage you to do exactly that, as the medical advice has highlighted.” Standing alongside Morrison at the media conference, the chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said he wanted to be “very clear” that masks worked to reduce the spread of Covid-19. “They do protect yourself, they do protect others,” Kelly told reporters. When pressed on the specific health advice he had provided, Kelly said: “The health advice is wear a mask.” In his post-national cabinet press conference, Morrison urged states and territories to stop requiring negative PCR tests for interstate travel, blaming it for unnecessarily extending Covid-19 testing queues and wait times. He also said the national cabinet would meet again in two weeks. He said they would all work on a common definition of casual contacts, and isolation and testing requirements, to try to end “different rules in different places”. There was no change to the interval for booster shots, which has already been reduced from six months to five months, despite calls from some premiers to further shorten the gap. Morrison said he would rely on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) on that issue. “That will be determined by the immunisation experts and no one else.” He said the focus of the booster program was vulnerable Australians, but he said also flagged further advice on “prioritisation”, including younger age groups. “We know that the Omicron variant moves very quickly amongst young people, and so we’ll be taking more advice on those issues.” The prime minister said the federal government would increase payments to GPs and pharmacists by $10 a jab, to provide an added incentive to continue the vaccination rollout over the summer period. He called on state and territories to reinstate vaccination hubs that were closed in recent months. The national vaccination coordinator, Lt Gen John Frewen, said Australia was on track to start the vaccination of five- to 11-year-old children from 10 January as planned. Morrison said Australians had “worked very hard” this year and were looking forward to Christmas. “My main message is to stay calm, get your booster, follow the common sense behavioural measures,” he said. “One of the things we agreed today is we’re not going back to lockdowns, we do not want to go back to lockdowns.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison insists mask mandates not needed despite health advice to make them compulsory indoors,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/22/scott-morrison-insists-mask-mandates-not-needed-despite-health-advice-to-make-them-compulsory-indoors
12/22/2021,"A £14 own-label champagne from Aldi has become a hit in the UK and is second only to Moët & Chandon in sales as shoppers seek luxury but without the hefty price tag. Veuve Monsigny, available only at the discounter, has overtaken Lanson, one of France’s most storied names, according to figures from the data firm IRI.  Veuve Monsigny is made for Aldi by the French producer Philizot & Fils. The company, run by the married couple Stéphane and Virginie Philizot, is based in Champagne’s Marne valley and has had to expand rapidly to keep up with demand. Christmas week is the biggest of the year for food retailers as Britons stock up to tide them over the holidays. But with inflation at a 10-year high, many households will be trying to save money by shopping around. Britons spend about £400m a year on champagne but prices are up sharply as producers have been hit hard by production problems as well as the delivery issues that have bedevilled the whole retail supply chain. The price of champagne increased 8% in the three months to September, according to Wine and Spirit Trade Association figures. Even Aldi, which vies to be the cheapest grocer in town has not been immune, as at £13.99, a bottle of Veuve Monsigny costs £1 more than last Christmas. Veuve Monsigny has won a number of accolades over the years, including a bronze award at the International Wine Challenge, where it was described as having a “floral palate, fresh with little development but beautiful balance and restraint”. Julie Ashfield, Aldi’s managing director of buying, said it was extremely proud of the champagne that was “up there with the best bubbles available”. In its annual champagne taste test, the consumer group Which? ranked offerings from Waitrose, Tesco and Marks & Spencer above the likes of Moët and Lanson – and Aldi. Lisa Barber, the group’s home products and services editor, said the results showed supermarket champagne brands could “more than hold their own against the famous champagne houses, delivering excellent quality and great value for money”. However, Aldi’s bubbly was overlooked by the judges who instead singled out Lidl’s Veuve Delattre Brut as the “great value pick”. At just £12 a bottle, they praised its “subtle, complex aromas, fresh acidity and clean, fruity taste”.",News/Business,Aldi’s £14 champagne becomes UK bestseller after Moët & Chandon,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/aldi-champagne-uk-best-seller-moet-chandon-veuve-monsigny-luxury
12/22/2021,"Christmas was always such a magical time for me when I was young, and the beginning of December 1970, filled with excitement and anticipation, was no different. I was six and though I had already figured out there was no Santa, I didn’t quite understand how presents materialised in the pillowcase annually hung from the post of my upper bunk bed. My parents were adamant about Santa’s existence, but my friends and older brothers had confirmed the awful, heart-wrenching, nihilistic truth of my suspicions. There were a lot of other existential questions in my mind that year. What was death? Did people seriously spend eternity in a box buried underground? What if they woke up? At school, the alternative of an eternity in heaven was presented by our overtly Christian teacher and, on balance, heaven definitely sounded preferable to an afterlife of maggot-ridden decomposition. The caveat of complete faith and devotion to a bearded man who floated on a cloud seemed a small price to pay for everlasting bliss. God even looked a lot like Santa, only his beard was more straggly and his suit less fun. Maybe God delivered the presents. Sorted. Roll on Christmas.  Then came the curve ball. I remember, that December, looking at a photograph in my mum and dad’s bedroom. I stared in shock. I asked who was in the picture. “That’s Rabindranath Tagore,” replied my mum. “He wrote plays, songs and poems.” My mouth dropped open at this tall, white-bearded figure, who the great pandit-ji Ravi Shankar would later in life tell me “looked like the sun”. “How many people out there have this look?” I wondered. “There’s God, Santa and now this dude. All with huge beards and a wise grin.” It was disconcerting. Which one delivered the presents? That December my mum also started explaining Hinduism to me. I know it was then because I remember what I was practising on the piano. Suddenly, there were lots more gods, but the beards varied hugely. Many had no beards at all. There were also goddesses, which confused me because the only female I’d heard of in Christianity ran around naked in a garden, tempting a man to follow her, with an apple. Also, with Hinduism you were cremated after death, which seemed altogether less boring. I told my mum we were being presented with an alternative perspective at school, of eternal damnation or heavenly bliss as opposed to the less intimidating magical stories of Krishna and Ganesh at home. She said that Hinduism accepted all other faiths and everything was really about being a good person. That helped a lot, because I’d heard Santa only gave presents to kids who were good. So even if there was no Santa, whoever was going to give me the presents felt my moral fibre was important. Everything seemed to tie up. Roll on Christmas. That year I could not wait to see the TV animation of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I’d watched it the year before and it was the most magical thing I’d ever seen. I loved Rudolph. I could already play the theme tune on the piano, and Rudolph himself was simply fantastic. Then it came, and I was so disappointed and unmoved. Rudolph had lost his magic. If there was no Santa, I realised, then Rudolph couldn’t possibly be real or meaningful. Just like the Lone Ranger was fiction too. People were making this stuff up. How deep did the lies go? Christmas finally came and I waited up in bed the whole night. Who should I expect? Could I be wrong about Santa? Was he real after all? Or would I be visited by some other bloke with a longer, more flowing beard? Or should I expect someone blue with eight arms and an elephant trunk? I’d seen one of those on the living room wall and I’d been told that was also God. Definitely not the one Miss Churchill talked about in class though. Hmm. So, early on Christmas morning, when Dad ran giggling into the room and slapped a pillowcase full of gifts on my bed, I just shouted: “Dad? What are you doing?” Belief is such a strange thing, I learned that Christmas. If we want to believe something, we seem to ignore reality till we have no choice. I do miss that magical world though … the world before dad ran into my room with no beard or extra arms … before I discovered the lies you hear as an adult are far less innocent and well-meaning than those accompanied by marvellous, warm, cosy dreams.

12/22/2021,"A jovial chorus of voices was fast approaching, punctuated by the excited yelps from an accompanying dog. “Beautiful morning for it, how far you walking?” came the call from the man at the front. Yet my party of 16 did not answer. The two people nearest to him moved awkwardly aside, as he became increasingly inquisitive. Then our leader – Abigail Rowe – approached him, clasping a sign that read: “We are on a silent pilgrimage. We mean no disrespect”.  Almost at once he voluntarily lowered his voice to a whisper and bade us good luck, then wandered on with his friends, now also in silence, too. I was an hour into an eight-mile silent pilgrimage with the ever-innovative British Pilgrimage Trust (which was set up in 2014 with the aim of bringing back spiritual journeys to Britain almost 500 years after Henry VIII banned them during the reformation). This latest offering ­– a one-day pilgrimage between the small church at Stoughton, in rural West Sussex, to the historic cathedral in the centre of Chichester – was offered to give anyone, regardless of their religion or lack thereof (they very much tout their “bring your own beliefs” motto), chance for quiet contemplation in the chaotic run-up to Christmas. For me, as a mother of a 14-month-old, the silence was a treat, but I was quickly discovering that the hardest part was not being able to chat to passing walkers – which is something of a sacrilegious offence between hikers. The 15 other souls who joined me had come from as far as Mexico (via London), the Isle of Wight and Hampshire – with a few locals thrown in for good measure. Their reasons for taking part ranged from thinking of loved ones who had recently died or were seriously ill, to coming to terms with a health diagnosis and trying to make peace with a religion that had scorned them for their sexuality. Then there were those who, like me, were in no way religious and simply wanted some peace in the outdoors. No matter what the reason, our guide Abigail, trustee of the BPT, asked us to think of an intention or subject we wanted time to consider and pick up an object to carry with us to remind us of it along the way. I wasn’t sure whether to think of something big – the recent loss of a friend – or something small, such as what should I do with my hair now it’s growing out post-lockdown? But I did decide to use the spiky husk of a beech nut as a symbolic reminder, which I placed in my pocket. Abigail read the poem Leisure, by WH Davies, after which the Stoughton rector, Lindsay Yates, offered us a pilgrim blessing. Then, without a word, we were off. At first it felt like a bit of a novelty – big grins on everyone’s faces as a cyclist called hello. But soon we were on an uphill footpath where we all seemed to fall into a rhythm. I began to notice sounds more than ever – the birds singing, the wind rustling the leaves, the popping sound walking boots make on stones. Even in silence there was still a rich soundtrack. I was still not really contemplating anything deeper than whether I could pull off a Rachel cut in the year 2022 when we passed the first chatty group just before the Downs at Kingley Vale on the (fittingly named) Devil’s Humps – a trio of burial mounds. Here more passersby were shown Abigail’s sign and reacted much the same, with a contemplative silence. We began descending the hillside to a path that took us to one of the oldest yew trees in Britain. It would have been tempting to talk about these ancient specimens, about how they were used as gathering places by druids, worshipped by pagans, used to make longbows for battle by the church and – these particular ones – believed to hold the deceased souls of the Viking soldiers who were defeated here, but instead we all just stood and admired them in quiet reverie. Here a few people gave the improvised sign to indicate a toilet stop (a necessary bit of sign language quickly learned to ensure no one got left behind), before we walked on to West Stoke Church, where we ate lunch in the glow of candlelight. From there it was a march towards Chichester, first along a minor roadside, then a pleasant diversion into Brandy Hole Copse, a small, wild woodland on the outskirts of the city. My thoughts kept wandering as freely as my feet. Though now it was more about my surroundings: pondering the type of fungi growing on a felled branch, or questioning the whereabouts of some particular noisy bluetits. When we emerged on the Centurion Way – the old Roman road that would take us to our destination – I thought of the many who had walked this way before us and what their reasons might have been. Then I placed my hand in my pocket and felt the prickles of the beech nut husk. It was then I thought about my friend. No great revelations came, but I did feel I finally had earned the time to linger with my thoughts – and my friend – for a while, and for that last half-hour I felt oddly at peace with the world. We soon arrived at Bishop’s Palace Gardens, where the wild woods were replaced with the manicured gardens of the cathedral, and the tweets of woodland birds became the raucous cries of gulls. It was here, standing on the top of the old city walls, that we were to let get of our objects. I smiled for the friend I’d had the privilege to know and now, like the beech nut, had lost to the darkening light. Moments later we entered the cathedral where the choir were singing a Christmas carol, which we were invited to join in with. Suddenly, 16 new voices began to emerge from our small crowd in unison. I looked to my fellow pilgrims and thought how odd it was to have spent six hours with a group of people without really getting to know any of them at all. Yet without a word being spoken, we had all learned something collectively – that no matter how chaotic it gets, silence is there waiting. All we have to do is stop talking, start walking and listen. The trip was provided by the British Pilgrimage Trust, which offers a range of pilgrimages throughout the year from single to multi-day options. The next silent pilgrimages are from Chidham to Chichester on 15 January and 14 April 2022 (with the latter including a swim in the sea), £40pp, or £35 each if booking for two",Lifestyle/Travel,"Silent hike, holy hike: a thoughtful country walk in Sussex to ease the soul",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2021/dec/22/silent-hike-holy-hike-a-thoughtful-country-walk-in-sussex-to-ease-the-soul
12/22/2021,"We are due to fly to Tenerife for a family holiday on 29 December. It was rolled over from last year. I have two children, aged nine and 12. The Spanish government requires all children of 12 and over to be fully vaccinated, but the UK government has not permitted 12- to 15-year-olds to receive a second jab. Consequently, my 12-year-old only received one dose. Do we need to cancel this holiday?KL, London Young people aged 12 to 15 have found themselves in a legal limbo when it comes to international travel. They were, until recently, too young to qualify for a second jab in the UK, so count as unvaccinated by countries which insist arrivals are double-dosed, but too old to be exempt from international vaccine requirements. This means they are barred from Germany, Malta and Canada, as well as Spain. Ski trips to Austria or Italy are a no-go since, although they would be allowed across the border, they are banned from public spaces, including ski lifts, while in France and Portugal they must take lateral flow tests to enter any tourist attractions. Given that this is your second attempt to take the holiday, the timings have been especially unlucky.  Spain’s new rules came into force on 1 December in response to the arrival of Omicron, and will have flung the plans of many families into disarray. At the same time, the UK government announced that 12- to 15-year-olds can now receive a second jab and, as of last week, those who have received both doses can get an NHS Covid pass letter for international travel. This will have come too late for you. The second jab has to be at least 12 weeks after the first and, given that vaccines for your son’s age group were not available until late September, and Spain requires the second dose to have been taken at least 14 days before arrival in the country, there was a tiny window for compliance. I fear you’d better try to postpone the holiday again, although there’s no guarantee you’ll get your money back. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk. Include an address and phone number.

12/22/2021,"‘When I was a child in Afghanistan I loved to watch my uncle play chess. Now I have joined the local club here.” Samir is grinning as he talks about settling into life on England’s south coast. “I’m very happy here, just being with my family, going for walks to look at the Christmas lights. It’s really beautiful.” After arriving in Greece alone two years ago, when he was just 16, and spending many months homeless and terrified in the port city of Patras, Samir recently made a journey that most refugees can only dream about. He said goodbye to the friends he had made in a camp for unaccompanied minors – other teenagers from Somalia, Iraq and Palestine – and travelled safely and legally to join his father and sister in the UK.  There were no lorries or dinghies involved; he was given a plane ticket and arrived at Heathrow. “My sister came to meet me and she was so excited that she wanted to take me straight to London to show me Oxford Street, but I was too tired,” he says. “So we just went to an Afghan restaurant. That was so good after such a long time, to eat real Afghan food again.” But for the lawyers and campaigners who fought for months to bring him here, Samir’s happiness is bittersweet. He is one of the last unaccompanied young refugees to arrive in the UK under the EU family reunion laws that ended with Brexit. “These are the final cases,” says Beth Gardiner-Smith, head of the child refugee charity Safe Passage. “We have one or two more children transferring to family here from France in the next couple of weeks, but these are the last young people coming through our Greek office.” After the Home Office admitted in 2018 it was planning to end family reunion when the UK left the EU after Brexit, there was a scramble by lawyers and families to complete applications by the deadline of 31 December 2020. The children who managed to achieve that are now here, but the door has been slammed shut behind them. For Gardiner-Smith, it is painful to see a safe route to the UK shut down just as the tragic cost of illegal journeys is becoming increasingly evident in the Channel. “It’s just such a waste of all the work we did showing that this route works,” says Gardiner-Smith. “It is so frustrating. The need is still there, children are still asking for our help in Greece, we are seeing lots of young Afghans arriving who have family in the UK. “We want to help them but we only have the very restrictive British immigration rules. Children can’t join uncles or aunts or siblings – these are the majority of our cases. Even joining a parent will be very difficult. “We are already seeing children get tired of the legal route and vanish to make their own way to the UK.” Safe Passage was set up in 2015 when the refugee crisis saw thousands of children travelling through Europe during the Syrian war. In France, lawyers found children living alone in the Calais camp and fought in British courts for them to join family in the UK. Since then, hundreds of children have safely joined uncles, aunts and cousins in Britain. Mohamed is another one of the final arrivals. He is living in the Midlands now and celebrating his 18th birthday this week with his aunt after a difficult few years that saw the Home Office refuse him family reunion three times. “I love England – it is so safe and organised. I was living for years in a refugee camp in Iran after my family fled the Taliban in Afghanistan. Iran wanted to send us back to Afghanistan but we stayed, living in hiding. “I left on my own and reached Greece, which was a very bad place for refugees. I met a social worker who said there is a group called Safe Passage [who] will help you,” says Mohamed. “They did – they helped my aunt, we found a solicitor and after refusing me three times, finally I got the evidence I needed. It was unbelievable to come here on the plane; it was like being born again. I am so grateful. “I wish I had the power to help the friends I have left living in tents in Greece; some have been there for many years and they are so afraid.” Like many of the children who applied for a family reunion visa, his case suffered multiple delays as the Home Office requested he provide more and more evidence. “I was refused three times, they didn’t believe me because I was missing documents and information,” he says. “I was so sad. “I couldn’t focus on anything, my aunt was in the UK and I was alone in Lesbos and Athens, but friends helped get money so a lawyer could get me a DNA test. Finally, I’m here.” Even when it was available to families, those granted a right to remain under the EU reunion process faced long delays. In cases highlighted by the Guardian, children were left living alone in dangerous conditions despite having the legal right to be in the UK. But without it, the future is bleak for unaccompanied minors stranded in Europe. While Samir finally celebrates being with his sister, his thoughts are with the people he left behind. There are more than 2,000 unaccompanied minors living in Greece, many of them without a safe place to stay. “I thought I was young to be travelling alone,” he says. “But when I got to Greece there were so many children and some were much younger than me. I was homeless for the first six months – it was very scary. “When I did get a place in a shelter for underage boys, there was one small boy there, just 13 years old. He had family here in the UK – two uncles – but nobody with him. I was a year and five months in the camp and every time a new boy got his family reunion and left – to Holland, to Germany – this boy was crying. When I left, he cried. I wish someone could help him.” Samir’s father is in Afghanistan now, desperately trying to get permission to bring his wife and their other children to the UK. Even though he is now a British citizen, he is finding it difficult to get permission for them to travel. Gardiner-Smith says her team are trying to help children in an increasingly difficult atmosphere in Greece. “The Greek government introduced hostile legislation, similar to what the UK government is trying to bring in. If you have come through Turkey then most asylum seekers are deemed inadmissible. “Although it doesn’t apply to under 15s, a lot of our unaccompanied minors are between 15 and 17 and their support is cut off.” The immigration bill now going through parliament will, she fears, make things worse in Greece as well, and she is working with a handful of supportive politicians in an effort to get provision for family reunion increased. “There will be two tiers of asylum seekers and those who arrived irregularly will be deprived of the right to family reunion,” Gardiner-Smith says. “We know what this means realistically – it means more people getting into small boats to try to join their families here.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘The need is still there’: last young refugees arrive in UK as family reunion route closes,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/dec/22/last-young-refugees-arrive-in-uk-as-family-reunion-route-closes
