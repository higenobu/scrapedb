3/31/2022,"A family in hiding in Afghanistan who are eligible for sanctuary in the UK but are unable to escape because they can’t get biometrics done in their home country have taken their case to the high court. The case highlights the differential treatment given to those fleeing conflict in Ukraine and Afghanistan over biometrics requirements. When Russia invaded Ukraine the Home Office initially said Ukrainians applying for visas had to provide their biometrics – unique facial data held on a chip in passports – before being able to come to the UK. However, after public outcry this requirement was relaxed in mid-March and Ukrainians with passports were permitted to do their visa applications entirely online and get biometrics done after reaching the UK. But the Home Office has not relaxed the rules for Afghans eligible to come to the UK. The family bringing the legal challenge consists of a father who is a British citizen, his wife and the couple’s five children, aged between seven and 17. They were unable to be airlifted out of Kabul last August due to a lack of space on evacuation flights. It is thought that many more families in the same situation are in hiding in Afghanistan. The father was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK in 2010, and later British citizenship. He lives and works in the UK and spends part of the year in Afghanistan with his wife and children. He was with his family when the Taliban took control of Afghanistan last August. He made the difficult decision to leave his family in hiding in January of this year in Afghanistan and return to the UK alone because he believed that as a British citizen he would put his wife and children’s lives at greater risk if the Taliban found them. As a British passport holder it was possible for him to get a flight out of Afghanistan to the UK. The family members still in Afghanistan are in a catch-22 situation of not being able to come to the UK until biometrics have been done, but not being able to get biometrics done as there are no British visa processing centres open in Afghanistan. Chris Buttler QC, acting for the family, said that the same rules should be applied to Afghans as have been applied to Ukrainians. The nearest place the family could get biometrics done is at a visa office in Pakistan, 300 miles from where they are. The journey would be a dangerous one, passing through many Taliban checkpoints en route. “The secretary of state has imposed an impossible condition on them applying,” Buttler told the court on Wednesday. The home secretary’s rationale for insisting on biometrics being done before family members of British citizens can come to the UK is to protect national security and immigration control. Representing the home secretary, David Blundell QC told the court that the situation on the ground in Afghanistan at the time that the Taliban took over was extremely difficult. He said the wife and children bringing the case along with the husband and father did not fit into any of the special evacuation categories. Blundell said it was an unimaginably difficult situation for the family and an extraordinarily difficult situation for the government at the time of the Taliban takeover.

3/31/2022,"In the week that saw the lifting of almost all pandemic restrictions in Wales, it’s a playfully bold proposition to stage a show about the emancipatory and healing possibilities of a plague. In Dance to the Bone by Eleanor Yates and Oliver Hoare, the plague is a dancing one. A mass hysteria that seemingly compelled hundreds of citizens of Strasbourg in 1518 to dance is suddenly resurgent in contemporary South Wales. Joanna Bevan (Yasemin Özdemir) works at the Insurance4U call centre where she is failing to reach her customer conversion targets. She is grieving the recent death of her grandmother – still present on a voicemail greeting – which is causing further familial tensions. The offer of transfiguration and reconciliation comes in the form of the mephistophelian St Vitus (Hoare), the patron saint of dancers.Co-directed by Joe Murphy and Matthew Holmquist, this is sleekly produced and staged gig theatre, performed by a small cast of onstage actor musicians. The ensemble work is lovely, and witnessing the dexterity of actors who can also play instruments (and sing and dance) is always a particular theatrical thrill. The songs possess an intoxicating and assured swagger, and the dancing choreographed by Krystal S Lowe possesses an undercurrent of horror despite expressive lyricism. On Simin Ma’s set, lit by Andy Pike, it feels like we’re in a sacred space: stained glass windows on one side, and God as a DJ on the other.But the beats of the drama are not as spirited as the music, nor as invigorating as the dance. It aims for the transcendental, hinting at the fleshy hedonism of an illicit rave and of healing through transformation, but is slightly mired by a narrative that is more mundane and less persuasive. This isn’t helped by the fact that much of the dramatic tension pivots on the use of the hackneyed trope where the Welsh language is rendered exotic, meaningful only as an incantation of strange earthy mysticism rather than a language in which people live their lives.But even if I was not quite swept off my feet, there is still much here to tempt the soul.

3/31/2022,"Let’s say you’re the president of the United States. You’re coordinating with a team of shady lawyers, elected officials, and political extremists to pull off a coup at the nation’s Capitol. And let’s just assume – in this hypothetical scenario – that you don’t want there to be a record of your highly incriminating calls. You’d probably want to use a burner phone. Investigators are now asking whether this matches what happened in the White House on 6 January 2021. The Washington Post and CBS News reported on Tuesday that a House investigation had found a seven-hour-and-37-minute gap in Donald Trump’s official call logs that day, during which hundreds of his supporters unleashed a deadly rampage at the US Capitol. Trump has pleaded ignorance, claiming in a statement to the outlets: “I have no idea what a burner phone is, to the best of my knowledge I have never even heard the term.” But the president’s former national security adviser John Bolton has disputed this, saying Trump used the phrase several times, in discussions about how to avoid having calls scrutinized. Either way, it’s important that all of us – including the president – understand what a burner phone is and does. A burner phone is a simple idea: a disposable phone, typically purchased prepaid and without a contract, that someone buys to make calls or send messages over a short period of time before “burning” the phone. Who uses them? In the popular imagination, burner phones are associated with crime. As Detective Carlton Lassiter quipped in the American sitcom Psych: “The only people who use these are low-life criminals, like drug dealers, terrorists, and people with subpar credit.” Breaking Bad’s antihero drug lord Walter White frequently uses cheap flip phones to make calls before snapping them in half. And in The Wire, Bernard, a drug hustler, visits convenience stores to buy prepaid phones for the rest of his organization. But burner phones are also used by activists protesting police brutality, Hong Kongers trying to evade Covid rules, cheating spouses, teenagers defying their parents and tourists avoiding roaming charges abroad. In short, we live in a time when mobile phones are so cheap and easy to get that anyone can use burners. Jake Moore, a cybersecurity expert and former police forensics officer in the UK, told the Guardian that burner phones can be “very difficult” for law enforcement to trace. Keeping a phone “clean” starts with keeping it disconnected from the internet. Expert users never carry the burner phone and their primary phones with them at the same time. “Your phone is a tracking device,” said the security expert. “If you are moving around with a burner phone and you’ve still got your other phone with you, then law enforcement can do some triangulation on where you were.” A burner phone can also be revealed by the people it contacts. “If a burner phone is speaking and contacting another phone, that other phone will have call records that connect the two,” said Moore. To maximize secrecy, the people you’re contacting should also use burner phones. According to the former cop, the most important burner phone principle is to discard it and replace it constantly. But not everyone remembers to do this. When he was a police officer, “often we would find a ton of these burner phones in a property”, he said. While snapping a flip phone looks cool on TV, properly “burning” a phone requires destroying the sim card, said Moore. Some people go to more dangerous lengths, including microwaving phones. There are some software alternatives to burner phones: the smartphone app Burner generates new phone numbers for users, and Signal is an example of a strongly encrypted messaging app. But while using these apps, “your phone is still emitting lots of data, especially location,” said Moore. “So it’s not a complete burner way of doing things.” So if someone were using a burner phone to orchestrate a coup from the White House, could law enforcement triangulate the user? While it might be possible from a technical standpoint, the greater barriers might be legal ones. “You’ve got to have a warrant to get that information on that particular person, which isn’t easy to do from a threat actor point of view, because they would have to go to prove why they need it through the courts, to the telecom provider, to get that information.” For the user, the biggest obstacle to burner phones is that they’re a huge hassle. Early in his term, Trump turned down a more secure phone, preferring to hang on to his favorite old Android phone. It wouldn’t necessarily be easy for the US president to keep switching burner phones, either. “You’re starting to kill the convenience,” said Moore. “You’re going to have to tell your nearest and dearest of the new number each time. But how can you trust it? If I get a message from Donald Trump saying this is Donald Trump’s new burner phone number, I’m going to suspect that it’s not.”",News/US news,Trump claims ignorance of ‘burner phones’.

3/31/2022,"The creators of Rossgram call it Russia’s answer to Instagram. Its critics call it “absolute shit”. As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, opportunistic developers have rolled out a suite of locally made social networks to replace services such as Instagram that have been blocked by the government, or YouTube, which is under growing pressure. Many appear to be hasty imitations or include obvious attempts at surveilling ordinary Russians, as the Kremlin tries to censor news about the war and further clamp down on dissent under the country’s president, Vladimir Putin. “We are very sad that many good and popular services for different reasons are halting their work in Russia”, wrote the creators of Grustnogram, which translates roughly as Sadgram, a parody (but working) social network where Russians can post black-and-white selfies to lament Russia’s growing online isolation and “grieve together”. “We are even sadder about what absolute shit is sometimes being offered up as substitutes”, the creators wrote. Already, some Russian state media and government agencies have begun moving their videos to RuTube, a YouTube alternative owned by the state-run Gazprom-Media. Even before the outbreak of the war, Russian authorities had been offering money to Russian influencers to switch over to the platform, a recent investigation showed. Uploads are reviewed by moderators before going on the site, but Russians who sign up through a government website that includes passport data can be “authorised”. NashStore, a Russian replacement for Google Play that takes the Mir payment system, a local alternative to Visa and Mastercard, is reportedly due to launch on May 9, the Victory Day holiday that has become the main patriotic holiday under Putin. The standard-bearer for the domestics apps is Rossgram, which was announced shortly after Russia declared Instagram’s creator, Meta, an extremist organisation earlier this month. Instead of releasing a fully usable site this week, the Russian developers instead gave a short preview. It looked a lot like Instagram, including a similar colour scheme, icons and other trademark features. That may fly in Russia now, where the government on Wednesday announced that it would begin to ignore copyright restrictions in a policy it calls “parallel imports” that essentially legalises intellectual piracy. “The goal of this mechanism is to satisfy the demand for [intellectual] goods”, said Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister. “Until now, we couldn’t sell [them] on the territory of our country without the agreement of the copyright holder.” The list of products, which will probably include films, television shows and video games, will be drawn up by a Russian government agency. The policy essentially reverses decades of efforts to crack down on bootleg movies and other content available in underground shops or on social networks like VKontakte, which had boasted of its efforts to remove illegal uploads in recent years. Putin on Wednesday also ordered government agencies to cease orders of foreign operating systems, which will include popular products from Microsoft, in the “interests of securing the technological independence and safety of Russia’s critical information infrastructure”. Russian government offices were ordered to stop using foreign operating systems by 2025. For now, however, some Russian officials and even agencies like the Ministry of Defence have continued to use applications like Facebook despite the official decision banning Meta, its parent company. Alexander Tokarev, the creator of Grustnogram, said that he was inspired to create the service after watching to roll out of Rossgram. Altogether, it took four people working for seven days around their normal jobs to put together the site, he said. “The idea came to mind when I saw Rossgram”, he told a local news site. “It was so embarrassing and ridiculous that I had an irresistible desire to make a response. This, of course, is primarily a statement. Because no one needs a Russian analogue [for Instagram] – it’s absurd.”",News/Media,‘Embarrassing’: Russia scrambles to copy banned social media platforms,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/30/russia-banned-social-media-platforms-rossgram
3/31/2022,"Joe Biden received a second booster vaccination against Covid on Wednesday and pleaded with Congress to approve more funding to fight any new wave of the virus, while asserting that although the pandemic is not over: “Covid-19 no longer controls our lives.” Speaking at the White House, the US president launched a new government website that he called a “one-stop shop” for accurate coronavirus information, covid.gov. And he told the public: “We’re now at a new moment in this pandemic. It does not mean that Covid-19 is over. It means that Covid-19 no longer controls our lives.” ‘It does not mean that COVID-19 is over, it means that COVID-19 no longer controls our lives’ — On Wednesday, Pres. Biden provided an update on his admin’s response to the pandemic, which now includes https://t.co/LDEdMq9eOg, a ‘one-stop shop’ website full of resources pic.twitter.com/qfsgvGzV9r “The bottom line, no longer will Americans have to scour the internet to find vaccines, treatments, tests or masks,” he added. Then Biden swiftly turned his remarks towards asking Congress for more money to continue the effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic. “Just as we’ve reached a critical turning point in this fight, Congress has to provide the funding America needs to continue to fight Covid-19,” he said. “This isn’t partisan, it’s medicine,” he added, warning that without the $22.5bn his administration is asking for, monoclonal antibody therapies to treat Covid will begin to run out by the end of May and preventive therapies for the immunocompromised will be exhausted by the fall. As for vaccines, he said: “If Congress fails to act we won’t have the supply we need this fall to ensure the shots are available free and easily accessible for all Americans.” Calling on politicians to act in unity, Biden talked up his record after taking over the presidency with Covid-19 omnipresent. “I’m gonna remind you, I took office about 14 months ago, the pandemic was raging, the economy was reeling, the deficit was soaring. Most schools were closed,” he said. “We didn’t have enough vaccines. The unemployment claims were sky high. And then we got to work and we delivered enough vaccines for every American months ahead of schedule, effective treatments, at-home tests that are free and accessible. Over 99% of our schools are open again.” The Biden administration’s response to the pandemic, however, stalled in several key areas, particularly after the spread of the Omicron variant in late 2021. He concluded the event by taking a second booster shot – authorized for Americans over 50 on Tuesday – live on TV and refusing to answer the questions he was being peppered with as he rolled up his sleeve and was injected about his telephone call that morning with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “It didn’t hurt a bit,” Biden said of the shot, apologizing if the sight of a needle going into his arm had “discouraged” anybody from taking the vaccine.",News/US news,Biden receives second Covid booster as he pleads with Congress for funding,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/joe-biden-second-covid-booster-congress-funding
3/31/2022,"In hindsight, it probably was not the best of ideas to throw a boozy party for most of his MPs the night before prime minister’s questions, even if he had strong-armed someone else into picking up the tab. Because the Boris Johnson that turned up in the chamber gave the appearance of either being out of his head on a combination of quaaludes and psychedelics or still desperately hungover. Either way, what we got was the Suspect at his most incoherent self. Not that this seemed to bother any of the Tory backbenchers who appear supremely unworried both by the cost of living crisis or proof of criminality inside No 10. And by the fact that their leader can give effusive support to Tory MP Jamie Wallis, who had just revealed he had gender dysphoria, the day after he had opened his dinner party speech with a trans joke. No disconnect there. They happily cheered whatever lies Boris chose to tell. And there were plenty of them. From the Tories having reduced the tax burden to Labour being hellbent on taking the UK back into both lockdown and the EU. Keir Starmer was also having a bad day. His questions lacked their usual focus and Johnson was able to get away more easily than usual without answering anything directly. Time and again, the Labour leader was unable to pin the greased piglet down. He could not even really make Partygate count, despite the Suspect continuing to insist that no lockdown rules had been broken in No 10. No matter that the police have issued 20 fixed penalty notices and counting. The closest anyone got to unsettling Johnson was Labour’s Sarah Champion when she asked him how he slept at night. The answer being that he gets pissed at parties. Or by himself. It was more of the same when the Suspect appeared before the liaison committee – the parliamentary supergroup of select committee chairs – midway through the afternoon, only rather more soporific. The hangover hadn’t gone away and it was all Johnson could do not to doze off. The effect was clearly contagious. Most of the committee chairs were also struggling to stay awake and the session was catatonically dull. For a brief moment at the start, things had looked rather more promising when committee chair Clive Betts – deputising for Bernard Jenkin who had Covid: a loss to comedy if nothing else, as no one takes himself more seriously than Bernie – ripped up the schedule and allowed Pete Wishart and Catherine McKinnell to ask questions on Partygate. So were you one of the 20 to receive a fixed penalty notice, Wishart enquired. The Suspect toyed with the toddler haircut and forced one eye half open. “I’m sure you would know if I were,” he mumbled. After that it was all downhill. Wishart continued to rattle through his questions. Could any prime minister survive being busted and found guilty? Was breaking the ministerial code a resigning matter? Would he accept that issuing FPNs were proof that criminality had taken place? Could he explain why his answers on parties had changed from “They never took place” to “I was outraged that other people had been to lockdown parties” to “I didn’t realise I was breaking the law”? To every question, the Suspect pleaded the 5th amendment. “No comment,” he said repeatedly. It was like an episode of Line of Duty. Johnson could not possibly say anything because he did not know how much dirt the police had on him. So it was best to say nothing for fear of further incriminating himself. He would be very happy to come back to the liaison committee at a later date when the police had convicted him. Or not. He didn’t sound like a man who was overly concerned one way or another. No one really expected him to tell the truth – even Dominic Raab, the deputy prime minister, was now admitting Johnson could only tell the truth “to the best of his ability”. Which was a very low bar. The point was further made when McKinnell asked how he felt about a petition calling for lying to the commons to be made a criminal offence. The Suspect shook his head. He tried to tell the truth, he said. But he just could not prevent the lies from spewing out of his mouth. He had already forgotten the lies he had told during PMQs. And he was definitely not responsible for any future lies that he would tell that afternoon. Like saying to Stephen Timms that he had corrected a previous lie about the employment figures. Or that he would just lapse into fantasy about how there were now 1.3 million people fewer in absolute poverty. Which just so happened to be the exact number of people thinktanks had predicted would be tipped into absolute poverty as a result of his government’s tax hikes. The rest of the session was devoted to Ukraine and the cost of living and proved to be spectacularly unrevealing. The highlights were Bill Wiggin, who has just come back from an expenses paid trip to Qatar, asking for more visas for, er, Qataris and Neil Parish wanging on for a full minute and a half about fertiliser. It was comedy gold. The Suspect tried to look interested and ended up promising both men the earth. As he had with all the other select committee chairs. Then that’s how Johnson operates. It’s classic Boris. Drag everyone down to your level. Keep the waters as muddy as possible. That way no one can see your own shit.",News/Politics,The Suspect staggers through PMQs as backbenchers cheer whatever lies he tells | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/the-suspect-staggers-through-pmqs-as-backbenchers-cheer-whatever-lies-he-tells
3/31/2022,"The trans woman cyclist Emily Bridges has been blocked from participating in the British National Omnium Championship on Saturday after cycling’s governing body, the UCI, ruled she was ineligible. Bridges – who set a national junior men’s record over 25 miles in 2018 – had been due to compete against several British Olympians, including Dame Laura Kenny, in her first race in the women’s category. However the UCI ruled the 21-year-old, who began hormone therapy last year to reduce her testosterone levels, was currently not compliant with its regulations as she is still registered as a male cyclist – and therefore cannot compete as a woman until her male UCI ID expires. The UCI’s decision came amid a growing backlash from within the sport, with the Guardian understanding that a number of female riders were talking about boycotting the event in Derby because they felt that Bridges, who was on the Great Britain Academy programme as a male rider until being dropped in 2020, had an unfair advantage. It is understood those riders were also supported by many in the performance team at British Cycling. In a statement confirming the news, British Cycling said Bridges was “disappointed” with UCI’s decision. “We have been in close discussions with the UCI regarding Emily’s participation this weekend and have also engaged closely with Emily and her family regarding her transition and involvement in elite competitions,” they said. “We acknowledge the decision of the UCI with regards to Emily’s participation, however we fully recognise her disappointment with today’s decision.” In a notable change in approach, British Cycling called for a “coalition” to address transgender and non‑binary participation in elite sports – and stressed that fairness was “essential”. In a statement it said: “Transgender and non-binary inclusion is bigger than one race and one athlete – it is a challenge for all elite sports. We believe all participants within our sport deserve more clarity and understanding around participation in elite competitions and we will continue to work with the UCI on both Emily’s case and the wider situation with regards to this issue. “We also understand that in elite sports the concept of fairness is essential. For this reason, British Cycling is today calling for a coalition to share, learn and understand more about how we can achieve fairness in a way that maintains the dignity and respect of all athletes. Across sports, far more needs to be done, collectively, before any long-term conclusions can be drawn.” However, a comprehensive review of the science, conducted by the five British sports councils (SCEG) last September, said that it was possible to draw conclusions based on the latest research. The SCEG said the science showed there were “retained differences in strength, stamina and physique between the average woman compared with the average transgender woman or non-binary person registered male at birth”. It also told sports that as a result there was no easy way to balance safety, fairness and trans inclusivity – and that they would have to prioritise which to favour.",Sport/Sport,Trans cyclist Emily Bridges banned from racing at British meeting after UCI ruling,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/30/trans-cyclist-emily-bridges-banned-from-racing-at-british-meeting-after-uci-ruling
