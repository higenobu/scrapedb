12/31/2021,"Schools and businesses will suffer next if widespread shortages of Covid tests continue, after staffing difficulties in hospitals and care homes. With the government’s website indicating no availability for PCR tests at walk-in services or by home delivery, and pharmacies continuing to struggle to meet demand for lateral flow test (LFT) kits, sector leaders say the shortages will have knock-on effects once the UK emerges from the holiday period.  Transport: train operators struggling to stay on track Train services have been disrupted by staff shortages caused by Covid. Great Western Railway said: “With rising numbers of staff unavailable to work because of positive Covid tests and having to self-isolate, we have taken steps to maintain service levels across the network. Unfortunately, this includes planned cancellations designed to minimise the impact on as many customers as possible.” West Midlands Railway said the Omicron variant was having “a significant impact” on its workforce. ScotRail said its services would be disrupted until 28 January because of a shortage of train crew, and services could be cancelled or changed at short notice. A shortage of staff has led Southern to halt services to and from London Victoria for two weeks. The routes had already been suspended this week due to engineering works, and the staffing problems mean the suspension will continue until 10 January at the earliest. Schools: test shortages have potential to delay start of term The Department for Education announced in November that secondary schools in England would need to test all pupils twice on site before they can return to the classroom. Schools have been given flexibility over when to carry out the tests, with many expected to spread out returns over the latter half of next week. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Schools and colleges are able to order lateral flow device test kits through an online ordering system … These orders are due to be delivered in the week commencing 3 January, and we have not been notified by the government of any issues affecting supply.” Several headteachers who spoke to the Guardian said they had stockpiled enough kits to test pupils, but feared that shortages of tests for teachers and other essential school staff such as caterers were likely to be a bigger problem. Care homes: slow results making staffing issues worse Some care homes have stopped allowing in visitors because of staff shortages, which have been affected by lengthening delays in getting results from walk-in tests. Care home staff are required to have two lateral flow tests and a PCR test each week. Nadra Ahmed, the chair of the National Care Association, said care homes were reporting delays of four days in getting PCR results, meaning the results were out of date before they arrived. “Agency nurses are not turning up, managers are having to work day shifts and night shifts just to keep the service covered – it has been horrendous. We continue to support families visiting where it is safe but some providers have had to close to visitors because they don’t have the staff to support safe visiting,” Ahmed said. Vaccinated residents who leave a home temporarily have to be tested for the following 10 days after they return, meaning availability of tests is crucial. NHS: call for tests to be reserved for staff NHS staff are required to take twice weekly tests but are not given access to lateral flow tests from their institutions and must seek their own, after a change in guidance over the summer. The surge in demand has hit NHS staff’s access to LFTs, leading to fears of staff shortages. Unison, one of the main unions representing health workers, said NHS leaders needed to “up the pressure” on the government to reserve tests for NHS staff if stocks were low. Helga Pile, Unison’s deputy head of health, said: “NHS workers are under enough pressure as it is without the additional worry of obtaining tests.” The call for priority testing for NHS staff has been supported by the Royal College of Nursing, NHS Providers and the British Medical Association, after reports that NHS trusts are reporting high numbers of absences related to Covid. Hospitality: tests needed for celebrations to go ahead A lack of tests in England could mean the efforts of restaurants, clubs and pubs to host New Year’s Eve celebrations are in vain, industry representatives said. With Boris Johnson and ministers telling the public that they needed a test before safely partying on 31 December, the hospitality sector said bookings remained at about half of that seen in a normal year. A lack of test kits could lead to that figure falling further. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: “We need to make sure people have access to tests so they can continue to come to work as well as partying.”",News/World news,"Covid test shortages will affect staffing in schools and businesses, leaders warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/covid-test-shortages-will-affect-staffing-in-schools-and-businesses-leaders-warn
12/31/2021,"The viability of thousands of small businesses is at risk as escalating energy costs take their toll on companies just as they try to recover from Covid restrictions, according to a stark warning from their federation. Small businesses, which employ almost 13 million people in the UK, are expected to feel the brunt of crippling energy costs in the coming weeks as firms begin to strike new fixed-term deals amid record high energy market prices across Europe.  The UK’s micro businesses, which employ fewer than 10 people each but a total of 4.2 million employees across the country, are “in trouble” due to the national energy crisis ignited by record energy market prices, according to a warning from the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). A survey by the group found that energy costs are the biggest concern facing its members and warned that they could pose an “existential threat” to firms that have already been dealt a blow by Covid restrictions. “This is a cruel pincer,” said Craig Beaumont, at the FSB. “It will lead to some businesses realising they cannot continue as is, either [by] trying to slash costs or, the last thing they want to do, lose people. Or they could have to give up altogether, shutting the business down and letting everyone go.” The looming risk to millions working in the small business sector threatens to compound a “cost of living catastrophe” in the spring, driven by stalling wages and rising tax and energy bills, which could make 2022 the “year of the squeeze”, according to the Resolution Foundation. The FSB is expected to reveal next week that almost half of its members consider energy bills to be the biggest potential “disruptor” to their businesses, over and above supply chain concerns and worries about the cost of fuel, which have reached record highs after a rebound in the global market price for oil. “It is micro businesses which are the ones in trouble. Many small businesses tend to buy their energy via fixed rate deals but when these end they face much higher charges,” Beaumont said. “For some, energy costs could prove to be an existential threat, particularly for the fragile end of the small business sector which is emerging from Covid-19 restrictions,” he said. “Anecdotally, we’ve found that energy bills are the main reason why some small businesses have remained closed and kept staff working from home. It is one of the only ways they can protect their finances against these costs.” Senior officials from the business department, the Treasury, No 10 and the energy regulator have met energy companies in a series of emergency talks over recent weeks in an attempt to avert a national energy crisis which could drive the average home energy bill to £2,000 a year by next April. The regulator, Ofgem, put forward a proposal on Thursday to help smooth the cost of recent energy supplier collapses which might otherwise add about £100 a year to the average energy bill. A spokesperson said the cost of its safety net had protected the credit balances of more than 4m households after the collapse of their supplier. However, the same protection is not offered to small businesses. “Small companies don’t have the commercial clout of larger firms which are able to negotiate competitive longer-term energy tariffs with a supplier, but they don’t qualify for the same regulated protections which are offered to households either,” Beaumont said. Senior industry sources said energy companies have argued in favour of a £20bn Treasury-backed fund, which could provide loans, repayable over a number of years, to help suppliers meet their costs without sudden hikes to home energy bills next year. There have also been calls to remove the 5% VAT charge from energy bills and move some policy costs into general taxation. The FSB is understood to have asked the government to extend many of the protections offered to households to help safeguard small businesses too. A spokesperson for the business department said it was “in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups” to explore how small businesses can be supported to manage the impact of rising global prices. Ofgem declined to comment.",News/Business,Energy costs and Covid pose ‘existential threat’ to UK’s small businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/30/energy-costs-and-covid-pose-existential-threat-to-uks-small-businesses
12/31/2021,"The South Africa wicketkeeper-batter Quinton de Kock has retired from Test cricket with immediate effect.  The shock announcement from the 29-year-old came on the day the Proteas suffered a 113-run defeat to India in the first Test at Centurion and comes during a controversial year for the player, who apologised after refusing to take a knee during the World Twenty20 tournament. De Kock said he wanted to spend more time with his family – with his wife expecting the birth of their first-born child in the coming days – but the decision was still a surprise given CSA had agreed to give him time off for the rest of the three-match Test series to attend the birth. “This is not a decision that I have come to very easily,” De Kock said in a statement. “I have taken a lot of time to think about what my future looks like and what needs to take priority in my life now that Sasha and I are about to welcome our first child into this world and look to grow our family beyond that. My family is everything to me and I want to have the time and space to be able to be with them during this new and exciting chapter of our lives. “I love Test cricket and I love representing my country and all that it comes with. I’ve enjoyed the ups and the downs, the celebrations and even the disappointments, but now I’ve found something that I love even more. “In life, you can buy almost everything except for time, and right now, it’s time to do right by the people that mean the most to me. “I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has been a part of my Test cricket journey from the very beginning. To my coaches, teammates, the various management teams and my family and friends – I couldn’t have shown up as I did without your support. “This is not the end of my career as a Protea, I’m fully committed to white-ball cricket and representing my country to the best of my ability for the foreseeable future.” The left-hander leaves the Test arena having played 54 matches with an average of almost 39, having scored 3,300 runs. He also scored six centuries and 22 half-centuries during that time after having made his Test debut in 2014. De Kock will be sorely missed behind the stumps, however, with 232 dismissals, including 221 catches and 11 stumpings.",Sport/Sport,South Africa wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock retires from Test cricket,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/south-africa-wicketkeeper-quinton-de-kock-retires-from-test-cricket
12/31/2021,"During a long, combative career in US political life, Harry Reid, who has died aged 82, made his most telling contribution as Democrat majority leader in the Senate. There, in 2010, he pushed through and then vigorously defended President Barack Obama’s groundbreaking healthcare reforms. Given the huge strength of Republican feeling against “Obamacare”, the president needed a streetfighter to drive his measures through to the statute book – and Reid was the man for the job. Quietly spoken but toughened by a hard early life and years spent swimming in the shark-infested waters of Nevada politics, he fought through the deeply polarised atmosphere that surrounded Obama’s health reforms to shepherd the Affordable Care Act through the Democrat-controlled Senate.  Just as importantly, he defended that landmark piece of legislation – which aimed to extend health insurance to more than 30 million uninsured people – against repeated attempts at derailment by a Republican-controlled House of Representatives. In particular, he orchestrated Senate resistance to House amendments that would have emasculated Obamacare, and in 2013 brokered a deal that ended a partial government shutdown engineered by Republicans in protest at the legislation. Obamacare aside, in Washington Reid was a centrist Democrat, and for the liberal wing of the party far less dependable than his firebrand counterpart in the House, Nancy Pelosi. He was opposed to abortion, supported the 1991 Gulf war, and at first backed George W Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, although in 2007 he came out against the second conflict there. He also raised more than a few hackles when he observed that Obama had been helped in his presidential campaign because he was “light-skinned”. But Reid survived that problem, as he survived so many others on the road to his elevated position in the Senate, and Obama acknowledged the early encouragement that Reid had given to his presidential aspirations. To the Democrats, he was a usefully blunt, outspoken scrapper who was happy to tackle the Republicans head on – and was prepared to publicly call Bush a “liar” and a “loser”. Although a pragmatist, he would not cut deals with the Republican leadership on what he saw as vital issues. “I know my limitations,” he once said. “I haven’t gotten where I am by my good looks, my aesthetic ability, my great brain or my oratorical skills.” Reid’s strengths were his sheer energy and political shrewdness, honed during a long rise to the top from difficult beginnings. He was born in Searchlight, Nevada, a tiny, searingly hot former gold-mining town in the Mojave desert, in a shack that had no toilet or hot water. Until the 1950s, Searchlight was best known for a notorious brothel called the El Rey, where it was said that Reid’s mother, Inez (nee Jaynes), did the laundry. His father, Harry Sr, was a miner and an alcoholic; in 1972 he shot himself. There was no high school in Searchlight, so Reid had to stay with relatives 40 miles away in Henderson, outside Las Vegas, where he went to high school at Basic Academy. His lucky break came there in the burly shape of Mike O’Callaghan, the school’s football and boxing coach. Young Reid was tough: he boxed as a middleweight and played on the football team. “I’d rather dance than fight, but I know how to fight,” he said later. An ambitious young man, he graduated from Utah State University, where he became a Mormon. He went to Washington DC and found a job with the US Capitol police, who are charged with protecting Congress, while he worked for a law degree at George Washington University. From there he returned to Nevada to become a prosecutor and, shortly after his father’s suicide, married Landra Gould, the daughter of Jewish immigrants. He soon became involved in Democratic politics, first in Henderson and then statewide. By 1968 he was a member of the state assembly and in 1970 was asked by his high school mentor, O’Callaghan, to run with him. O’Callaghan was elected governor of the state and Reid became his lieutenant governor. In 1974 he ran for the Senate, but was narrowly beaten by Ronald Reagan’s friend Paul Laxalt. In 1975 he stood, again unsuccessfully, for mayor of Las Vegas, a city dominated by gambling, tourism and entertainment. From 1977 to 1981 he was chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission, a job that was to be the making of him. When he was offered a bribe of $12,000 by Jack Gordon, the Las Vegas gambling and prostitution operator, Reid tipped off the FBI. At the moment when Gordon produced the money, FBI agents rushed in; he was sentenced to six months in prison. In 1981, a bomb was found under Reid’s car, which he always blamed on Gordon’s heavies. After that, the more respectable elements of the US gambling industry supported Reid, although his opponents repeatedly tried to tar him with suggestions of ethical violations. In 1982 he was elected to the House of Representatives from the Las Vegas district, and served there until 1986, when he entered the Senate for the first time. He was re-elected easily in 1992, but six years later was nearly beaten in a high-spending campaign that his Republican opponent, John Ensign, a man with casino connections, freely conceded was “nasty”. Nonetheless, Reid and Ensign eventually became good friends as Nevada’s two senators. By 2004, when Reid’s time for re-election came around again, Nevada’s population had grown so fast that many of his constituents had never heard of their senior senator. So Reid raised a lot of money for a campaign to make himself known. He became the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate in 2005 after Tom Daschle failed to be re-elected, and after the 2006 election – when the Democrats benefited from the unpopularity of the Iraq war and the mishandling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina – he was confirmed as the Democrats’ majority leader, serving in that role until 2015. He retired from the Senate as minority leader by not seeking re-election in 2016, following injuries in an accident with exercise equipment in his home. In 2018 he revealed that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Reid was known in Washington for his terse manner. In a tribute to him in 2019, Obama joked: “Even when I was president, he would hang up on me.” Shortly before his death, Las Vegas’s airport was renamed after him. Reid is survived by Landra and by their four sons and one daughter.

12/31/2021,"As people across the UK prepare to ring in the new year, one thing that will be missing for many is a Covid lateral flow test. Town-centre pharmacies’ stocks have been wiped out as people seek assurance before attending parties or meeting vulnerable relatives.  While it’s not unusual for shopping centres to be busy between Christmas and new year, with shoppers hitting the sales and enjoying festive markets, the most sought-after products are proving to be the tests. On Thursday the Guardian visited four chemists in Kingston upon Thames, a busy shopping hub in south-west London, and found that three were out of stock and the fourth had one kit left. Staff advised customers to come back tomorrow, with test kits also unavailable to order online. The NHS website allows users to search for tests by postcode but none of the recommended pharmacies in Kingston upon Thames had any in stock. Boxes of 20 LFTs were available at a council-run testing facility. Some shoppers told the Guardian it was the only place they had been able to pick up tests. “I’ve tried three different pharmacies in the high street where I live over the past couple of weeks and they’ve been all out,” said Sally Arnold, from Surbiton. “It’s also going to be make it tricky for people going back to work if you can’t get hold of them, as we have to go in to the office.” Her friend Lisa Sanders, also from Surbiton, said: “I ordered some about a week ago and I’m still waiting for them to be delivered – every time I look on the app it says ‘sorry, no deliveries’. “I think people are trying to be responsible and to do the right thing but if you can’t get hold of tests then what can you do? I was lucky, I saw my sister over Christmas in a different part of the country and she is able to get them and gave me a box, but you just can’t get them anywhere round here.” A member of staff at the facility, who wished to remain anonymous, said LFTs had been available at the testing site throughout the year but footfall had “shot up” since the Omicron variant led to a sharp rise in recorded cases. Ministers have been urging people to test before socialising, and the surge in demand has outstripped supply. Beverley Bairstow, from Kingston, said she had come straight to the council facility after hearing about shortages at pharmacies closer to where she lives. She said: “I didn’t even bother trying anywhere else because I heard they haven’t got them. We try to keep some in the house but now we have run out and were told our local chemist doesn’t have any left. We did also try online but there weren’t any available either. When we saw there were some here, we thought: great, at last.” Francesca Rowland said she had stocked up on tests for friends and family as well as herself. “I haven’t been able to get any tests before today, and because I work in a school I need to be doing them every day,” she said. “It’s not been easy because we can’t order online now, but luckily I knew this was here.” Lutz Amechi, from Kingston, said: “My belief is the only way we will get through this is constant, frequent testing, so we test every second day at home.”",News/World news,‘People are trying to be responsible’ – but there are no lateral flow tests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/people-are-trying-to-be-responsible-but-there-are-no-lateral-flow-tests
