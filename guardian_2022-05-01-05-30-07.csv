5/1/2022,"Destigmatising mental illness is an ongoing campaign. Is it helped by Khloé Kardashian on TV popping beta-blockers that she gets from her mum? No. Let me remind readers upfront and outright that beta-blockers are not candy, and you should never take any medication not recommended by a doctor - especially ones whose side-effects can include nightmares, vomiting and heart failure. Maybe Khloé Kardashian has seen a doctor, in which case we shouldn’t be concerned that there’s Kris Jenner, on their show, handing out the meds like E at a 90s rave. “Oh, I love those!” Khloé says, and quaffs. “I know. They’re really great!” responds her mum. Casualising medication doesn’t destigmatise mental illness, but honestly examining its context really does. Kardashian tells a friend her anxiety’s due to the scrutiny of her body in public and on social media. It affects her self-esteem, confidence and the way she views herself. The valuable lesson here is Khloé Kardashian’s problems aren’t even special. They’re screamingly common. Her estimated $40m net worth easily funds the appearance enhancements of a basic makeup bag, which a recent piece from Mamamia showed set far less well-known women back from $400-$800 each. I tremble to think what – as a 47-year-old woman – my own investment in this area has cost. I’ve hardly experienced the mass assessment of a Kardashian, but I’ve internalised the micro-scrutinies provoked by the occasional public appearance, and they’ve had a material effect. Alas, “I’m not rich enough to be pretty,” sighed a friend when a recent group chat of media-adjacent types got into pricey recommendations for eye-cream. Khloé Kardashian is rich enough to be all kinds of pretty. Yet “I think it’s gotten to the point that it’s literally safer to stay at home”, she says, of the self-consciousness that has her scooping up the pills. Cosmetic procedures now constitute an annual billion-dollar industry in Australia: 90% of procedures are for women. In 2021, the Australian beauty market turned over 22 times that, with women spending an individual $3,600 on beauty every year. What does it say that you can literally beautify to Kardashian levels and still be made paranoid about how you look? I mean, apart from “levels of depression and anxiety for women are growing globally” – something which probably should be said more often. A recent article appeared in The Atlantic about a sadness epidemic swallowing American teens, particularly girls. It traced its beginnings to 2012 – the year when the number of Americans with mobile-social-media-capable smartphones went over 50%. The writer explained that girls have an intense sensitivity to peer judgment, which social media “seems to hijack”. Only teenagers? A 2018 study showed women in general were less likely to be happy with their bodies if they spent more than an hour on social media a day. Kardashian mentions its “deteriorating” effects on her by name. So why do we all keep going back there? Social media usage has been stable for the past five years, despite women’s widespread experience of bullying and “heckling” Kardashian describes. We know why; social media is our public square, to avoid it is to shun society. Worth more analysis is how that digital square is built from visual content that implies society doesn’t change – when people do. Philosopher Susan Sontag described photographs as memento mori. By slicing out moments and freezing them, she wrote, “all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt.” Once, a metaphor for that relentless melt was in the physical properties of photographs themselves. They’d fade, crack, pick up creases and stains. Their shapes and borders were subject to fashion, just as clothes and hairstyles in them pinned their contents to a specific point in time. But photographs are no longer artefacts of a deteriorating past. Digital photos represent an eternal visual present. Bullying only works when it names a weakness its victim can already feel. Heavy tradition encourages women’s self-esteem to be based in how we look – so how strong could even a Kardashian be, when the most obvious sign of time’s passage is on the body that you live in, ageing and changing while its visual world does not? Our flaws can be scrutinised to the pixel. Digital photography turns living women into the Picture of Dorian Gray. This week, 78-year-old model Lauren Hutton appeared shirtless on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar. Tempering any celebrations – OMG! She’s even got wrinkles! – was Hutton’s line in an accompanying interview, about her career. “I was about to become 30,” she says, “and I knew I was about to expire”. No wonder we’re spending up big on the eye-cream; even supermodel Hutton’s had botox. There’s an existential terror to beauty. I’d block it out if I could. Wouldn’t you?",Opinion/Opinion,"As Khloé Kardashian appears to know, there’s an existential terror to beauty | Van Badham",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/as-khloe-kardashian-appears-to-know-theres-an-existential-terror-to-beauty
5/1/2022,"When Sharee McCammon and her partner set out for Sydney on a road trip the price of petrol in cities along the east coast had spiked to more than $2 a litre. But the couple made the 2,751km journey from their home in Huonville, south of Hobart, for the total fuel cost of $43.38. “We were invited to a wedding in Sydney, my niece’s wedding,” McCammon says. “And we thought we would do a test if our very short-range, relatively cheap, second-hand EV was up to the trip. “The idea was to make a road trip, so we took our time. We wanted to see little towns, have lunch and things along the way.” It was almost three years since the prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested electric vehicles would “end the weekend” because they would not “get you out to your favourite camping spot” among other things. For McCammon, 55, the purchase of a 2016 Nissan Leaf second hand from the Good Car Company for $24,990 saved the road trip. The drive between Sydney and Melbourne cost just $12.74 one way, and $13.86 return for a total of $26.60, compared with the $150 or more it would have cost one-way in a petrol-fuelled car at the time. The Tasmanian legs of the journey in the Leaf accounted for the remaining $16.78 of the total cost. The trip took the couple, who belong to a coalition of social and environmental groups called the Tasmanian Climate Collective, on the overnight ferry from Devonport, up through Melbourne to Wangaratta. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning From there they drove to Yass, and then on to Goulburn and Sydney, where they stayed a week before making the return trip. The couple charged their vehicle several times along the way. McCammon, a self-confessed “data nerd”, says the average recharge time was between eight and 20 minutes, which they used for driving breaks, lunch and dinner. “It’s not enough time to get a coffee,” she says. “We took our little camp stove and we never got to finish our cup of tea before the car was ready. “It’s important to note that this is one of the smaller range EVs you can buy. Most new EVs might only need one charge to or from Sydney to Melbourne.” The PM might have attempted to walk back his rhetoric on electric vehicles but his government has done little to support uptake despite consumer price index figures for the March quarter showing transport costs have risen 13%. Behyad Jafari, from the Electric Vehicle Council, says electric vehicles represent an era of accessible road transport, yet they have not received much attention in the current federal election. “Electric vehicles today can do all the things the average driver wants them to do and they do it in a way that makes it fun to drive,” Jafari says. “Right now it’s as close as you’ll get to free transport. “The need now is to ensure that opportunity becomes available to more and more people.” Jafari says while Labor has “taken positive steps” in going into the election with a policy to reduce the cost of electric vehicles, the Coalition has done little during its term in government. “In the past decade the Coalition has been abysmal in addressing this issue and that continues throughout the election.” EVs make up roughly 2% of new cars sold in Australia, compared to around 20% in the UK and Europe.",News/Environment,‘As close as you’ll get to free’: Tasmanian couple take road trip to Sydney in electric car for $43.38,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/01/as-close-as-youll-get-to-free-tasmanian-couple-take-road-trip-to-sydney-in-electric-car-for-4338
5/1/2022,"Regardless of who wins the federal election on 21 May, the real winners of the campaign so far are sports facilities in marginal seats. An analysis of data from Guardian Australia’s pork-o-meter shows sport-related promises dominate the announcements from both parties, accounting for one-third of Labor’s seat-specific announcements so far and 15% of the Coalition’s announcements. This makes it the most common announcement category for Labor, and the second most common for the Coalition after infrastructure. The “sport” category covers any promise relating to sports facilities, infrastructure, team funding, and so on. There have been more than 260 funding announcements of this nature made by the two parties. The majority of these announcements are in marginal seats, with 70% of the Coalition’s sport-related announcements benefiting a marginal electorate. Labor’s promises are similarly skewed, with 53% going towards close seats. Lyons and Corangamite top the list for marginal electorates, with five promises each from both major parties. In Lyons, the Tasmanian electorate held by Labor’s Brian Mitchell on a margin of 5.2%, both parties have made commitments to upgrade the facilities of the same two football clubs: Launceston City FC and Brighton Storm. But the Coalition is slightly ahead on the scoreboard, committing $500,000 more to Launceston City’s Prospect Vale Park than Labor, with both parties pledging $2.3m to Brighton’s Seymour Street precinct. In the regional Victorian electorate of Corangamite, held by Labor’s Libby Coker on an ultra-thin 1.1% margin, the parties are not going toe-to-toe on any announcements for the same facilities, but have still committed almost $25m between them in funding. The Coalition has stumped up the largest commitment in the electorate, a $20m plunge for an indoor pool in Drysdale. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Across the country, the funding announcements have ranged from $25m to $20,000. They have often come with an intangible benefit to the candidate or MP announcing them: the opportunity for colour and movement that may be compelling enough to get them on the TV news. Although it does not always go according to plan (like when Scott Morrison copped a basketball to the face during a funding announcement earlier in the campaign). Miraculously, none of those sporting funding commitments have been made for Kardinia Park, the home of the AFL’s Geelong Football Club, in the electorate of Corio, just outside Corangamite. The stadium has become colloquially known as Pork Barrel Park because of its long history of attracting government funding. Several announcements have been made to improve women’s facilities, in a bid to shatter the so-called “grass ceiling” preventing more women and girls from participating in sport. The next most common announcement category after sport was “community”, covering promises relating to parks, playgrounds, community halls and the like. Community-related promises account for 21% of Labor’s announcements and 14% of the Coalition’s. The Coalition has promised $320,000 in federal funding for a dog park in the marginal Melbourne seat of La Trobe, which includes “nice landscaping”, and an off-leash park area. In many cases, community and sporting announcements have a considerable cross-over, such as when the Coalition promised $1.25m for a new community hub in the town of Torquay which would support a men’s shed, community garden and Lions, Rotary and tennis clubs.",News/Australia news,"Sport tops parties’ election spending promises in marginal seats, pork-o-meter reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2022/may/01/sport-tops-parties-election-spending-promises-in-marginal-seats-pork-o-meter-reveals
5/1/2022,"Vulnerable Australians are missing out on adequate healthcare because the Medicare rebate is failing to keep up with the costs of providing services, leading to a critical GP shortage, community health organisations say. Not-for-profit community health organisation Cohealth has not been able to operate its street doctor service in Sydney’s CBD – which provides a GP to people sleeping rough – for more than nine months, because it cannot find a doctor to work there. Cohealth nurse Vaan Phongsavan has been left to carry out the program. She now sees people in the CBD homelessness clinic instead of out on the road with the organisation’s bus. “It was working well but the funding was basically grant money … [so] I have been working alone and the bus no longer runs, I see patients in the clinics,” Phongsavan said. Last month, a patient came in with a very painful infected abscess in his mouth. Phongsavan spent hours trying to find a bulk-billing GP that would see him. Cohealth had no free spaces and the closest bulk-billing clinic with a spare appointment charged $35 for an initial consult – money the man did not have. Phongsavan eventually found the patient an appointment with a dental hospital but does not know if he received treatment. She said most of the people she sees could benefit from also seeing a GP – to write scripts, perform cervical screenings or do a full checkup. “Our clients are complex. In a 15-minute appointment you are not going to get very far,” she said. “A lot of mainstream services can’t afford to do this because it is time-consuming and it’s expensive.” The waitlist to see a Cohealth GP is long, and the struggle to recruit more doctors is driven by the massive pay disparity between public and private health models in Australia. Cohealth chief executive, Nicole Bartholomeusz, said the pay on offer to work in community health is about one-third of what a GP in a private practice or hospital would receive. The current Medicare fee-for-service funding model is geared to high volume, short, transactional appointments, and is unsuitable for community health primary care, she said. It does not stretch far enough to meet the complex needs of vulnerable patients. “Without good doctors working in community health, vulnerable clients are at risk of missing out on the kind of integrated care that they need,” Bartholomeusz said. To deliver its service, Cohealth runs its GP programs at a “significant” loss – with the organisation covering the cost, she said. “While Medicare remains a fundamental part of Australia’s universal health care system, it needs to be enhanced to support those most in need,” Bartholomeusz said. Cohealth is not the only organisation struggling to employ doctors. ​​Total Care Medical clinic is a bulk-billing practice in Frankston. Director, Lucina Wilk, said after losing four doctors across the pandemic, she had so far not been able to fill the positions. “I’m down to one doctor and I have 6,000 active patients. I have a database of 30,000,” Wilk said. “For clinics like mine, this is devastating.” For a standard consultation, bulk-billing doctors receive about $38 from Medicare – but a doctor in a private practice will make about $85 for the same session, she said. “There are no doctors – just no doctors. I am constantly advertising to get doctors. I’ve gone to about six recruitment agencies.” To be able to afford to run the clinic, Wilk has started to charge private fees for some services – but wishes she didn’t have to. “It’s a very, very tricky situation.” From 2020 to 2021, just 67.6% of all GP patients had their consultation bulk-billed, according to the Productivity Commission’s Report on Government Services 2022. For many, access to community healthcare is life-saving. Indi Shanmugam, 57, was stabbed after a No Room For Racism rally in Melbourne in 2015. The wound caused a bacterial infection that spread to his spine. “In the C7 [vertebra] near my neck they had to sever the nerve and put a metal plate in,” Shanmugam said. “I lost everything below my chest. I couldn’t feel my legs.” He was in hospital for a year before being discharged into an aged care facility. He started seeing Cohealth GP Dr Paul MacCartney regularly, who put him on a program to deal with his drug dependency and helped him get on to the NDIS and into independent housing. Shanmugam said if it wasn’t for the Medicare rebate he would have to fork out thousands each year for his bills – which he just would not be able to afford. “I can afford to live a comfortable life with just the pension that I am on now.” Australian Medical Association vice president, Chris Moy, said there was “no bloody way … not a hope in hell” that community health services could continue under the current financial model. The organisation has launched its Modernise Medicare campaign this election to demand extra funding for longer consultations, including after hours, and to provide more holistic care with pharmacists, dietitians and other allied health workers. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Neither Labor nor the Coalition has announced plans to increase GP Medicare rebates – and much of the election focus so far has been on whether Senator Anne Ruston, who would be health minister if the Coalition is re-elected, wants to privatise Medicare – a policy she publicly supported in 2015 before it was scrapped by the Coalition. “The current rebate for a standard consultation – it’s $38,” Moy said. “It’s about the same as a men’s haircut, for a 20-minute consultation. “The AMA’s position is we need to shift the funding model to favour practices that give high-quality care and are willing to go [the] extra mile and support their patients.” He said both parties were letting down the public. “You have the LNP government which has totally betrayed the sector by saying [the AMA’s plan] is the right thing to do, but are sending it to another committee – and Labor, who claim to be the friend of Medicare, but we haven’t seen anything substantial from.”",News/Australia news,Vulnerable Australians missing out on healthcare as insufficient Medicare rebate drives GP shortage,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/vulnerable-australians-missing-out-on-healthcare-as-insufficient-medicare-rebate-drives-gp-shortage
5/1/2022,"Veronica Nelson was jailed three times in the last 12 months of her life, but had never been sentenced to a period of imprisonment as an adult. The Yorta Yorta, Gunditjmara, Dja Dja Wurrung and Wiradjuri woman died in custody while on remand for shoplifting offences on 2 January 2020. She had spent 80 days on remand in the previous 12 months awaiting bail for shoplifting offences – the same offences for which she was remanded in custody again on 30 December 2019, three days before her death. At the Melbourne coroner’s court this week, an inquest into the 37-year-old’s death has been examining the circumstances surrounding her bail hearing on 31 December 2019. It has also been examining Victoria’s bail laws, which the court heard have had a significant impact on the ability of Aboriginal women who are before the court on minor offences to be granted bail. The evidence so far has detailed how police errors, a lack of legal representation and a change to bail laws contributed to putting Nelson behind bars. Nelson was arrested outside Southern Cross station at 3.35pm on 30 December and taken to the Melbourne West police station. She was arrested on two outstanding warrants relating to failing to attend the Koori court in Shepparton to be sentenced for shoplifting charges. Police had also issued three whereabouts notices, seeking to interview her in relation to further shoplifting incidents alleged to have occurred in October and November 2019. The remand form to be presented before the magistrate was completed by senior constable Rebecca Gauci. Under cross-examination from Rishi Nathwani, the lawyer representing Nelson’s mother, Aunty Donna Nelson, Gauci admitted that the form was “riddled with mistakes”. Gauci had checked the box suggesting that granting Nelson bail would pose “unacceptable risk” to the safety and welfare of others. She told Nathwani she ticked that box because Nelson was stealing to “fund her lifestyle” and drug addiction, and there was a risk that she could respond violently if “confronted by a staff member who wants to protect their property”. But she agreed, under questioning from Nathwani that there was no evidence of Nelson ever acting in a violent or even confrontational manner. “So there’s never once been a suggestion … [that] she’s ever assaulted or threatened the welfare of anyone?” Nathwani asked. “No,” Gauci replied. Gauci agreed with Nathwani’s statement that the box “shouldn’t have been ticked” and that the form she prepared was “a document riddled with mistakes”. Under Victorian law, police must notify the Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service (VALS) when an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person is taken into custody. That notification was made about 4pm on 30 December 2019. VALS records, put before the court, say that they called the police station at 4.27pm and were told that Nelson was currently being interviewed by police and did not want to speak to anyone from the VALS. Gauci’s notes put the time of first call at 4.07pm, but also say that Nelson did not want to speak to VALS. VALS says they made a total of four attempts to contact Nelson between 4.27pm and midnight. They did not get through. Nelson was taken to the Melbourne custody centre, the cells underneath the Melbourne magistrates court, at 7pm, arriving too late for her bail application to be heard that night. She spoke to a duty lawyer for Victorian Legal Aid, Peter Schumpeter, who then contacted Nelson’s lawyer, Jill Prior. Prior is the principal legal officer of the Law and Advocacy Centre for Women and had acted for Nelson since December 2018, when she was on remand on shoplifting charges. The next morning, on 31 December 2019, Prior had a phone conversation with a barrister named Tass Antos and briefed him to represent Nelson in her bail application. Antos spoke to Nelson in the cells. But when her bail application was called, Nelson represented herself and was denied bail. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Prior told the inquest she was of the view that Antos would be appearing for Nelson on behalf of the Law and Advocacy Centre for Women, and would be paid by them – either via a grant of legal aid or, if legal aid were not granted, by Prior herself. She said she had listened to an audio recording of the bail hearing, which was played before the inquest, and that there were “glaring absences of information” concerning Nelson’s health. Antos told the inquest on Thursday that he had not represented many Aboriginal people in his career. He repeatedly said he could not recall details of the hearing or the conversations he had with Prior around the hearing, but said to the best of his memory there may have been “high hurdles to getting bail”. He agreed under cross-examination that he may have offered Nelson the option of representing herself so as not to jeopardise a future bail application. Gauci told the inquest that police opposed bail because Nelson’s offending met the threshold for the “exceptional circumstances” test in the Victorian bail act. It puts the onus on an accused person to show that compelling reasons or exceptional circumstances exist for them to be granted bail. It previously applied only to very serious offences, like murder, but the act was changed in 2018 to broaden the circumstances for which this test can be applied Nelson met the “exceptional circumstances” test because she was accused of having breached bail and having committed an indictable offence while on bail. Prior said that the change to the act had created a “dire landscape” for the granting of bail because the lowering of the threshold for the exceptional circumstances test meant that people were being remanded in custody for offences that would not ordinarily carry a sentence of imprisonment. “The categorisation of bail thresholds as exceptional circumstances in my experience is almost the norm,” Prior told the inquest. “The very vast majority of our clients would present with an exceptional circumstances threshold. All of our clients are women. At least 40% are Aboriginal women – the vast number of those clients are presenting with offences that could be categorised as less serious offences. Not offences against the person; property offences, breaching offences.” On Tuesday, Sharon Lacy, the counsel assisting the coroner, said that 61.4% of all Aboriginal women held in Victorian prisons as of 1 June 2021, were held on remand. “Like Veronica, over three-fifths of Aboriginal women in custody at any given time are waiting for their matter to be heard,” Lacy said, in her opening address to the court. “They may never receive a prison sentence but are held in prison on remand. This inquest will consider what mechanisms are involved in making this so.” The inquest continues.",News/Australia news,"Police errors, no legal representation and strict bail laws: why was Veronica Nelson behind bars when she died?

5/1/2022,"Flood victims in New South Wales’ northern rivers say they are still struggling to find accommodation, as some are kicked out of caravan parks to make way for tourists. Linda Barney, 69, and her husband, Bob, lost everything in the floods. Their house in Coraki is destroyed and they are not sure when they will be able to return to it. The couple have been staying at the Big4 caravan park in Casino, but on Wednesday were given 24 hours’ notice that they had to leave. “I went to the reception at three in the afternoon, I had not heard from the disaster accommodation people, but they had told me we had two more blocks of four weeks there,” Barney said. “The receptionist said we had to leave at 10am. She said ‘we’ve booked you out, we’ve had internet bookings from people who want to stay.’ “With less than 24 hours’ notice me and my husband were going to be homeless … we were under the belief we were there for another eight weeks.” Her husband, Bob Barney, 75, has emphysema so needs to be close to his doctors in Casino. The Big4 was their third accommodation in two months. They slept on two church pews pulled together at the rescue centre, before moving to Yamba for four weeks. Guardian Australia contacted Big4 for comment but did not receive a reply. Panicked, Linda Barney went to the recovery centre, which managed to get them a three-week spot in the Discovery Park, but she said the situation rattled the couple. “I was shocked,” she said. “[Permanent] accommodation just doesn’t exist.” On Thursday, the NSW government set up the first temporary accommodation site in the area, at Wollongbar, which will house up to 200 people. But industry insiders say it will take another three-to-six months to build the next sites, and in the meantime, people are living in limbo. Chief executive officer of Northern Rivers Community Gateway Jenni Beetson-Mortimer said they had dealt with several clients now who were kicked out of short-term accommodation. “We have had clients who have been asked to move for other people,” Beetson-Mortimer said. “There are [also] people who have now been getting eviction notices. They’re being asked to move on but there’s nothing else to go to. That’s a challenge for them.” She said other people were living with friends, couch-surfing, in garages or in tents. “There are thousands,” she said. “In north and south Lismore you’re looking at thousands of people who need relocation.” People can’t get rental properties locally – and they don’t know where to go, or how long they can stay if they can find something. “We are seeing people who are really traumatised,” Beetson-Mortimer said. Antoinette O’Brien considers herself lucky. That’s despite the fact the artist lost her home, studio and most of her work in the floods. She has been living in a caravan on a property just outside Lismore – but doesn’t know how long she will be able to stay there. “Where I am right now, is so fortunate,” she said. “But I have absolutely no idea how long I can be here.” Her son’s father, who she co-parents with, also lost everything. They’ve been trying to find him stable accommodation – an impossible task. “There are flooded houses and there are flooded houses, with good airing. You walk into some, and even though you’re desperate for a space, some places are so wet that it’s just not safe at all,” she said. “[Before the floods] we lived in the only affordable housing we could find, we can’t pay twice that. How is that an option?” Strummers has put her name down for one of the 2,000 temporary pod homes announced by the state government, but is worried about the location – she wants to be able to put it where she needs to live. In announcing the pods, the minister for flood recovery, Steph Cooke, said the NSW government was doing everything possible to find housing solutions for flood-affected communities. “Housing is one of the greatest challenges we face in the wake of the unprecedented flooding. Our priority is for everyone affected by this disaster to have access to safe housing while they rebuild and recover,” Cooke said. She said the pods would be a medium-term housing solution for the community. “Once the Wollongbar site is established and the connection of utilities is complete it will be handed over to housing provider, North Coast Community Housing, with the first accommodation to be allocated by early May.” North Coast Community Housing CEO John McKenna said there were currently 650 people on the waiting list for pods, but it was expected to grow. “The government has committed to setting up 2,000 median terms responses,” he said. But the pods are only part of the solution, he said, with the floods exacerbating the housing crisis in the area. “The first step was for emergency accommodation for people displaced, then temporary midterm accommodation for two to three years for people while their properties are repaired. “The third part is long term – what do we do? There was a housing crisis long before the floods.”",News/Australia news,NSW flood victims kicked out of caravan parks to make way for tourists,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/nsw-flood-victims-kicked-out-of-caravan-parks-to-make-way-for-tourists
5/1/2022,"Kaylene Milner was first drawn to knitwear as a fashion student, where she taught herself the basics after finding her course largely sidestepped the practice. “I just really liked how tactile it was, with minimal waste,” she says. “As a young designer you don’t have access to as much of the textile industry … but with knitwear you can create your own fabrics.” After graduating, Milner started her label Wah-Wah Australia to tap into her love of punk rock and knits, which had been inspired by an old photo of Dinosaur Jr frontman Jay Mascis with his high school band Deep Wound. “He’s wearing a hand-knitted Deep Wound sweater that his mother made him, I just thought it was so charming and ridiculous.” A musician herself, Milner’s early collaborations with Australian punk bands the Hard Ons and the Meanies soon led to a “full circle” moment when Dinosaur Jr contacted her. “They got in touch with me, which was amazing and kind of surreal. I don’t know if [Mascis] realises that he’s the inspiration for the brand. Or how small it was at that point – I was literally living in a sharehouse, sitting on my bed designing, with a cupboard in my room that was my stockroom.” Another big break came in 2019, when the ensuing Dinosaur Jr jumper was worn by former Mighty Boosh star Noel Fielding on The Great British Bake Off. Now, her knits pop up all over television and the internet, proudly worn by Courtney Barnett, Taika Waititi, Ben Lee and Tony Armstrong, featuring designs from Sonic Youth, Devo and Silverchair, and visual artists such as Kaylene Whiskey, Aretha Brown, Reg Mombassa and Fielding himself. Glynis Johns, curator at the Powerhouse Museum, says knitwear holds a storied and often democratic place in Australian fashion history. “There was a tradition of really fine home knitting in Australia, which came out of the Great Depression when clothing was hard to get. But you could get the yarns and rework old yarns, unpick old jumpers and redo them, and there were lots of patterns available.” Australia’s undisputed queen of colourful knitwear, Jenny Kee, tapped into this decentralised network of home knitters to realise her vision in the 1970s. “Because Jenny doesn’t knit, she did a callout and drew people who had those skills and could knit pieces in their own homes,” Jones says. “She wanted to make something very Australian, using Australian wool, featuring Australian motifs to create this lovely winter season of knitwear. The first pieces were quite simple – she’d found a zipper-front vintage cardigan in a Vinnies shop, and used that as the basis for her design.” While Kee has recently launched a new children’s line revisiting her early kangaroo-and-koala-covered work some of her original designs are finding a second life. Hunter Valley-based Etsy seller Bec Grant started her online store Retro Colour Pop a few years ago. After initially selling a variety of vintage wares, the Kath and Kim fan soon pivoted to jumpers. “I found that the jumpers were going as soon as I’d put them in my shop,” she says. Stocking everything from Ken Dones and Coogi knockoffs to Kath Day Knight’s wattle-shouldered triumph, the former primary school teacher says her store’s traffic stats show most shoppers make a beeline for original Kee pieces – which can sell for between $1,500 and $5,000. “It’s people from all over – mostly Australia – that I’m selling to – but Kath and Kim is huge in the US as well.” “When I was at school if someone came to you and said ‘that jumper is ugly’, you would be mortified,” Grant says. But these days “it’s part of the appeal” and “a cool compliment”. Many of Grant’s listings evoke a sunny, uncomplicated vision of Australia typical of the 1970s and 80s: full of native flora and fauna, bright colours, postcard landmarks and the occasional boomerang. It’s a canon that invites some unpicking in 2022: one hand-knitted, unlabelled piece celebrates the 1988 Bicentennial, but in her item description Grant reframes 1888 simply as “the year that Australia was invaded”. Some of Wah-Wah’s output also counters that legacy, from a fundraising collaboration with Gumbaynggirr artist Aretha Brown that asks us to: “Know y/our history, decolonise y/our future”, to one of Milner’s most popular pieces featuring the work of Yankunytjatjara artist Kaylene Whiskey. “As soon as it launched it really resonated with people,” Milner says of Whiskey’s jumper, which mixes cockatoos and boomerangs with her idols Cher, Dolly Parton and Wonder Woman. “There’s a sense of celebration: of her culture, of her friends and family in Indulkana, and her love of pop culture.” Milner’s collaboration with Mombassa, another icon of Australian art and fashion, also has a thread of activism, with its “Sweater enthusiasts for climate action” message raising money for Firesticks Alliance and the Climate Council. “It’s a loud sweater and it’s a message that needs to be loud.” While Milner still runs her business from home, her 100% Australian merino pieces are made offshore. Many local manufacturers focus primarily on corporate wear and school uniforms, she says. But according to Jones, some recent developments suggest there’s a future in the home-spun approach of yesteryear. “During lockdown, fashion design students didn’t have access to the schools and all their facilities,” Jones says. “UTS … actually supplied their students with a domestic knitting machine, so a lot of the work from the graduates last year [was] … done on knitting machines – it was really gorgeous.” Milner was also impressed: “I think we’re going to see some really exciting knitwear coming out of Australia.” Whatever the future holds, Grant says despite the threat of moths and accidental shrinkage, people seem to cherish and preserve their knits, whether designer, daggy or both. That care ensures they can be brought out again and again, when taste and weather permit. For Milner, such longevity is the dream: “I hope people can bring my garments out of their wardrobe in 30 years’ time and pass them on to their children.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Daggy, daggy, cool: the loud jumper is back",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/30/daggy-daggy-cool-the-loud-jumper-is-back
5/1/2022,"The Liberal National party’s decision to direct Queensland voters to place One Nation second on their Senate ballots could be “the deciding factor” that sees Pauline Hanson re-elected, experts say. It is a strategic move which political opponents have seized on as one which could alienate moderate voters within the party and see a backlash against Liberals in marginal seats. The electoral analyst Ben Raue said that of six Senate spots up for grabs in Queensland at this election, Labor would probably win two, the Greens one and the LNP at least two. That could see the Liberal senator Amanda Stoker, United Australia party’s Clive Palmer, the Liberal Democrats’ Campbell Newman and Hanson competing for the final spot. Should the LNP win more than enough votes to elect two Senate candidates, but not quite enough to land three, Raue said their voters’ preferences could be decisive. “If they fall in that sweet spot, those preferences could be the deciding factor,” he said. One Nation made headlines on Thursday when the minor party announced it would target “left-leaning Liberals” by directing preferences away from the likes of Bridget Archer in the ultra-marginal Tasmanian seat of Bass. Scott Morrison was in the marginal north Queensland seat of Leichhardt that morning, when he was asked if that ploy could snuff out his chances of winning a majority government by unseating the area’s socially progressive MP, Warren Entsch. “I think there’s further information to come on that, particularly in relation to Queensland,” Morrison said. Later that day, One Nation confirmed it would not be targeting Entsch and made no mention of any Queenslanders on its preference hitlist. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Coalition has also released its how-to-vote cards, directing voters to list One Nation second, UAP third and Liberal Democrats fourth. Raue said this recommendation was more significant than any from One Nation, whose voters do not like to take directions. In contrast, Liberal voters were “probably the most loyal” and the party had the volunteers and resources to hand out enough cards on election day to make an impact. “Major party conservative voters, Liberal voters, are the most disciplined when it comes to following how-to-vote cards,” Raue said. “So if this is a deal, they [One Nation] have got the better end of the deal.” However, it was a move which he said could see a backlash against moderate Liberal MPs, such as Trevor Evans in the marginal seat of Brisbane and Julian Simmonds in nearby Ryan. Simmonds holds Ryan by a margin of 6%. It’s a seat that the Greens see as a two-horse race between Simmonds and their candidate, Elizabeth Watson-Brown. The incumbent is recommending voters preference his Greens challenger last, below candidates from UAP, One Nation and Liberal Democrats. “I don’t think it is gonna go down well here in Ryan,” Watson-Brown said. “The sense we are getting is that there is a whole lot of people, traditional Liberal voters, who are fed up with them, fed up with the conservative lines they are pushing and absolutely fed up with their inaction on climate change.” Comment has been sought from Simmonds and Evans.

Nelson said she was “disappointed, but not surprised” by the LNP’s Senate how-to-vote card. “It’s pure mathematics, they would rather have [Hanson] in the Senate,” she said. “It’s all about Morrison’s style of attempted leadership, which is all about control.” Nelson said she now described herself as politically independent after the LNP had “lurched to the right” and been “cannibalised by extremists”. She supported her local MP in the seat of Blair, Labor’s Shayne Neumann, because of “his decency” and said other former LNP voters also couldn’t support the Morrison government. “It’s about bad behaviour,” she said. “It’s a bit like sending them to the sin bin.” The Liberal Democrats president, John Humphreys, said he believed the LNP was being “vengeful” in not directing preferences to Newman, the former Queensland premier who was at one stage “one of the most senior Liberal figures in the country”. “We were disappointed the LNP put Campbell behind Pauline and Clive on their Senate ticket, especially since polling shows that Campbell is more popular among LNP voters than any of their own state MPs,” Humphreys said. The Queensland Conservation Council director, Dave Copeman, said the move was a sign the LNP had not “moved beyond the climate wars”. He said One Nation members had been “dismissive of climate science” and had promoted “conspiracy theories”, and that the election needed to deliver a parliament committed to net zero and climate action. “Business knows this, the community knows this, but our politics seems to be stuck in the climate wars, and One Nation is the worst example of that,” he said.",News/Australia news,LNP preferences could be ‘deciding factor’ for One Nation in Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/lnp-preferences-could-be-deciding-factor-for-one-nation-in-queensland
5/1/2022,"Like a cornered thug lashing out, Boris Johnson hides his weakness by pretending to be strong. In every respect that matters his administration isn’t a government but a taxpayer-subsidised rabble without intelligence or purpose. The prime minister himself staggers from crisis to crisis as drunks roll round a pub. To steady himself he throws out crowd-pleasing punches: dumping refugees in Rwanda, tearing up solemn agreements with the European Union, privatising Channel 4. His stunts have a one-sidedness that deserves more attention. The only crowd Johnson wants to please is the mob to his right. At the last election, 13,966,454 people voted Conservative. Many were moderate, educated people in commuter towns and relatively prosperous suburbs. Fear of Jeremy Corbyn and the feeling that the Conservatives were the party that could best manage the economy gave the Tories their votes. In his moment of crisis, Johnson is taking their support for granted – assuming, that is, he thinks about them at all. I doubt he does because the one constituency that matters to him now is Tory MPs. If he can persuade them that he will survive a vote of no confidence, and there is thus no point in demanding a leadership election, he will see off a rebellion and live to blight another day. As Conservative MPs are now more rightwing than ever – further to the right even than the party membership – there’s no mileage in appealing to the centre ground. Johnson would commit political suicide if he tried to be reasonable. The only other bloc he would die rather than alienate is the rightwing press. Read the Mail, Sun, Telegraph and Express, and the network of online sites that have abandoned journalism for power-worship, and you will struggle to find a liberal conservative viewpoint. The right is the only place from where opinion can flow. The Tory press is Johnson’s world. Writing comment pieces for its editors was the only skill he mastered. He does not just need their approval, he wants it, craves it, as we all want the blessing of our bubbles. Dominic Cummings revealed that Johnson had told him that the Telegraph was his “real boss”. Despite stiff competition, this could be the most demeaning sentence uttered by a British prime minister. To finish the catalogue of Johnson’s failings – I accept that there are many more but my space is limited – Robert Harris once used a John le Carré line to describe Jacob Rees-Mogg: “He’s a barmaid’s idea of a gentleman.” Johnson has a posh boy’s idea of the working class. He thinks they are a little bit racist and a little bit stupid and care more about culture wars than the crushing price of food and fuel. I think and hope that he’s wrong, but time will tell. What, though, of another side of the Tory coalition? The professional people, who follow procedures and ethical standards and expect others to do the same. They are the men and women who make much of this country work. Keir Starmer doesn’t frighten them because he is one of them, while the Liberal Democrats might have been designed to receive their votes. And vote they do and they know enough about politics to know how to vote tactically, particularly now the Tories no longer appear to care for them. “Johnson doesn’t offer my constituents anything,” a senior Conservative from a southern seat told me. “He just sucks up to his friends in the rightwing media.” David Gauke, the former MP and justice secretary Johnson purged from the Conservatives for refusing to agree to a hard Brexit, said he could see his corner of Hertfordshire and large parts of southern England turning away from the Conservatives. Liberal graduate couples moving in to escape the punishing house costs of London were transforming the home counties. I am told that Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, fears Johnson will lose him his seat in my home town of Altrincham. When I was a boy, Altrincham was one of the most Conservative areas in the north: the place where suburban Manchester met the north Cheshire gin-and-Jag belt. Now even the golf clubs don’t tolerate racism and, Corbyn notwithstanding, the Conservative majority was down to 6,000 at the last election. Labour could take the seat now he’s gone. I’m not pretending that middle-class small “c” conservatives are crypto-socialists. They might deplore the brutality and vulgarity of the Johnson government and wish their fellow citizens had never fallen for the Brexit debacle, but they voted Tory for the same reason their predecessors voted Tory: not out of love but because they thought the Conservatives kept taxes low. Twelve years of Conservative rule have given them the heaviest tax burden since the 1940s. A government that has wrenched us out of the EU cannot make the economy work and so must demand we pay more for less. Or they thought that the Conservatives would allow middle-class income to grow. During 12 years of Conservative rule, average disposable income has barely risen. Millions have not had a real pay rise for a decade. Or they believed the Conservatives when they said that, if you worked hard and showed talent and drive, the Tories would see to it that you were rewarded. After 12 years of Conservative rule, we have a social system closer to feudalism than meritocracy. Parental wealth always mattered, of course; the class system did not arise from nowhere in the 2010s. But in much of the UK it is now the decisive factor. The poorer they are, the slimmer the chances of the young and middle aged buying a home become. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies said, the size of the family inheritance you receive will probably mean more than anything you can achieve by your own efforts. No wonder Johnson is waging cultural battles. After the failure of austerity and Brexit, they are all the Conservatives have left. Like generals, politicians and political commentators fight the last war. Because of the Tory success in capturing white working-class votes in 2019, they obsess about “the red wall”. At some point in the 2020s, you will hear the shuddering noise of gears being yanked into reverse. Those same politicians and commentators will ask what the hell made the Conservative party of all parties believe it could ignore its core constituency and treat the respectable middle class as if they were “the left behind”.  Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The red wall? Boris Johnson should worry more about Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells | Nick Cohen,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/30/the-red-wall-boris-johnson-should-worry-more-about-disgusted-of-tunbridge-wells
5/1/2022,"The Liberal party is being challenged by independents in a swathe of mostly inner-city seats. With polls suggesting independents are a chance to win normally blue-ribbon seats such as Wentworth, North Sydney, Kooyong, Goldstein and Curtin, the counterattack has been fierce. But what do Liberals mean when they label their opponents “fake independents” – and is it a fair criticism? Prof Graeme Orr, a politics expert at the University of Queensland, says an independent is a candidate “not endorsed by a registered party”. Parties must be governed by a constitution, endorse candidates, have 1,500 registered member and use their name on the ballot. Although historically independents tended to be breakaways from political parties, recently independents have had success organising without prior party affiliation. Cathy McGowan won the seat of Indi in 2013 and was succeeded by MP Helen Haines, using a community organising model of conversations around kitchen tables that became the “voices of” movement. Zali Steggall won Wentworth from former prime minister Tony Abbott in 2019, ushering in a new wave of “teal independents”, who take their name from the distinctive blue-green colour used by many of them in their advertising, targeting progressive Liberal-held seats. The Liberals have seized on everything from independents’ financial backers to their voting record, past party membership and refusal to say who they would make prime minister to argue they are “fake independents”. On Thursday Scott Morrison told Sky News: They’re anti-Liberal … I mean, they’re not running against the Labor party. They’re only running against the Liberal party. And some of them used to be members of the Labor party. They make no secret of that. This is an anti-Liberal party funded by big money with Simon Holmes à Court. Climate 200 is a fundraising vehicle convened by businessman and activist Simon Holmes à Court, which aims to raise at least $20m for community candidates running for more action on climate change and integrity issues. Holmes à Court has rejected suggestions the candidates are “in cahoots” or under any form of direction from Climate 200. He told the National Press Club: They are truly independent, and we have no influence in what they will do in the next [period] immediately following the election. Nor do we seek to … If we were to try to undermine independents, not only would none of them want anything to do with us, but we would be living a lie and I can’t … The candidates will make their own decisions, they will have a mandate from their communities. Liberal party ads and some MPs have criticised the independents and Climate 200 for having unknown funding sources, or disclosing donors without revealing how much they are receiving. Orr says they are simply playing by the same rules as everybody else, as the Commonwealth Electoral Act does not have spending limits or mandate real-time disclosure, unlike many states. “In the past, the Liberals seemed happy with that – either due to their liberal philosophy or perhaps their donors’ interests,” he said. “[There’s no sense] complaining that Simon Holmes à Court won’t legally have to declare all donors for some months or that independents are spending up to seven figures – they knew Clive Palmer spent big at the last election, and they didn’t do anything about it.” The teal independents are mostly running on a near-identical platform of greater action on climate change, improved integrity including a national anti-corruption commission, and better treatment of women. They have also on occasion announced policy together, such as North Sydney’s Kylea Tink and Mackellar’s Sophie Scamps joining Steggall on Friday to announce a target for new electric vehicles and fuel efficiency. Orr says if enough independents are elected to parliament, their combined bargaining power and “simpatico minds” on policy may see them evolve “customs, if not rules” about how to pursue common goals in parliament. “They could end up forming a parliamentary bloc, but it still doesn’t mean they meet technical requirements of a party.” Perhaps the most potent charge in seats that usually vote Liberal is that several independents have been members of Labor: Monique Ryan (Kooyong) was a member from 2007 to 2010, and Kate Chaney (Curtin) joined in 2021 but is no longer a member. Chaney told Guardian Australia: I grew up in a very Liberal family and then through the course of my adult life, I’ve felt less represented by the Liberal party and really just deeply disillusioned with the system. I joined the Labor party briefly, but I was dismayed by the ‘us and them’ tribal approach. And really, I think there are good people in both parties, but the system is what’s not working. On her website Ryan says she “briefly joined the Labor Party once when Kevin Rudd said he’d ratify Kyoto … but I am not Labor”. “In vain hope I even signed up to the promise of ‘Kevin07’ as a member, but like many Australians, I was disappointed. When Kevin Rudd walked away from climate action, I walked away from him,” she says. The Liberals have also targeted independents for their voting history: at the ballot box for the newcomers, or in the parliament for those who are already MPs. According to a parliamentary library analysis, Haines voted 68% of the time with Labor, and Steggall 66% with Labor. But as both note, this figure is inflated by votes on procedural motions such as crossbenchers voting against the government gagging debate. Chaney says: I’ve been a swinging voter for my life. Yes, I have voted Liberal. I’ve voted Labor. I think I voted Greens once. At the last election I actually can’t remember how I voted. Although the independents are criticised for allegedly voting for parties of the left, some Liberal discontent is triggered by the sense these candidates have good Liberal pedigrees and should be running for them. Chaney’s grandfather was in the Menzies government and her uncle, Fred Chaney, was deputy to Malcolm Fraser. Spender is the daughter of former North Sydney MP John Spender, a frontbencher under Howard and Peacock, and the granddaughter of Sir Percy Spender, a cabinet minister under Menzies and Fadden. But Spender says: “I’ve never found that either party really represents what I stand for.” Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie has announced her intention to approach the Liberals to form government in the event of a hung parliament, and Steggall has suggested she would be more likely to do so if Scott Morrison were dumped. But for the most part, the independents have not said who they would make prime minister if they hold the balance of power, drawing predictable ire from opponents: Yesterday, Independent MP @MakeMayoMatter had the integrity to say they’d likely back the Coalition in a hung Parliament, aware Mayo had never been held by Labor. Why doesn’t the so-called ‘independent’ in Goldstein have the integrity to do so as well? Answer:#FakeIndependent Wilson’s opponent, Zoe Daniel, says “this election is in the hands of the voters and I will not pre-empt their decision”. “I have no premeditated position on which major party I would support in a hung parliament situation,” she explains on her website. The question has featured prominently in candidate debates. Spender says: “I haven’t made up my mind. It depends what happens at the negotiating table on the day. I’m open to work with either side of government.” Tink says: “It will be my job as the independent for North Sydney to get the best possible deal I can around the things North Sydney are sending me to get that deal on.” Orr agrees that “disclosing your hand before the election is not a great idea, either in terms of increasing your voter base or to leverage policy” in negotiations. “It makes no sense to say in advance that you’ll only deal with one side or another in government.” Veteran political commentator Barrie Cassidy argues that is in fact the true mark of an independent. “You’re a fake independent if you slavishly say you will only back one of the major parties.” Liberal MPs are engaged in obvious hyperbole labelling their opponents “fake independents”, but are entitled to make the case. If independents are strategically silent on who they would prefer to lead in a hung parliament, they must take the downside of partisan attacks, along with the upside of broader appeal among ordinarily Liberal-leaning voters.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: is it fair to label candidates challenging Liberal moderates ‘fake independents’?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/factcheck-is-it-fair-to-label-candidates-challenging-liberal-moderates-fake-independents
5/1/2022,"Mystery “Missy” Sixtus was just seven when she moved to Australia, too young to know about becoming an Australian citizen. When she was a teenager, she started hanging around a rough crowd. “I screwed up,” Sixtus says. “I started to get into trouble.” She was 18 when she was found guilty of an assault, for which she spent a month in prison. Then the federal government deported her, alone, to New Zealand under Australia’s Migration Act. Those laws give the immigration minister what have been called “God-like” powers over overseas-born people in Australia. The minister can cancel their visas for a range of reasons, sending them into detention then back to where they were born. Section 501 has been hotly debated recently. Earlier this year the Coalition was seeking “more discretionary power” to cancel visas using the character test. Labor said the government already had the power to cancel visas at will, but eventually waved the changes through the House of Representatives. They remain unlegislated as no time remained for Senate debate before the election. The government has been cancelling the visas of increasing numbers of people, mainly to NZ, which is strongly critical of the laws. People are often sent to countries they barely know, are isolated from family and friends, and sometimes cannot even speak the language. It’s happening not just under s501, but s116, which again uses the character test. It has a long list of reasons the minister can use to cancel a visa, including if the holder “may be, or would or might be, a risk” to the Australian public. Sixtus had her permanent visa cancelled under s116. She is still trying to get home to Australia. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She says she was never a threat to the public, and it came as a complete surprise when she was taken into immigration detention a month after her release from jail. “I didn’t know what to do. The Border Force came … I was like: ‘What the hell is going on? I didn’t know that could happen’,” she says. She admits she “screwed up”, but says she was scared and confused by the process. From the start of 2019 to the end of 2021, 1,090 NZ citizens were removed from Australia – 1,029 of them were considered to have left voluntarily. Asked whether “voluntarily” was the word used when someone was given a choice between staying in detention and leaving the country, the ABF says: “New Zealanders who are detained as unlawful non-citizens can request to voluntarily return to their home country at any time. Those who are unwilling to depart voluntarily may be subject to detention and removal from Australia.” Earlier statistics released under freedom of information laws show there were 36,420 s116 cancellations, including 463 minors in the five years to the end of 2019. Section 116 is the one that was used to deport tennis player Novak Djokovic. Filipa Payne, an advocate for New Zealanders’ rights, says the process of deportations is “morally bankrupt”. “Under s116 you can reapply [for an Australian visa] after three years,” Payne says. “[But] I don’t know anyone who’s been successful in that application, because they then cancel them under 501. It’s morally bankrupt, and it’s completely destroying families.” Sixtus is now 23, and trying to make a life in Auckland, studying business and marketing. It hasn’t been easy. “My family’s still in Australia. I’ve been alone this whole time, moving around,” she says. “I’m trying to make a life, to get comfortable.” But she misses her family, and her life in Australia. “I actually got deported on Mum’s birthday. It’s so hard for her because she can’t come over all the time,” she says, adding that the situation has been complicated by Covid. “I grew up there. I’m more Australian … I still miss it a lot. I miss my life over there,” she says. “We all change. We should all have a chance to prove ourselves.”",News/Australia news,‘A chance to prove ourselves’: Australia’s hardline deportation policy leaves no room for second chances,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/a-chance-to-prove-ourselves-australias-hardline-deportation-policy-leaves-no-room-for-second-chances
5/1/2022,"Matt Davis is surveying his land while sipping a knock-off beer. His property would fit into the average Queensland farm more than 5,300 times and he can afford to relax – there are no fences to mend or animals to feed and his crops are impervious to the vagaries of the weather. Davis is an exotic mushroom grower, his pocket-sized farm in the equally diminutive town of Harrisville, south-west of Ipswich, a repurposed lawn bowls club. The former cafe owner started growing mushrooms at home for family and friends. “I spent five or six years studying mushroom growing and learning everything I could from reading books, and watching YouTube and Facebook videos and just connecting with people and asking questions,” he says. “When this unique property came up for sale, I thought it would be perfect for commercial growing.” A former second world war army barracks, the property once housed soldiers stationed at Archerfield airport before being redeployed as Harrisville District Bowls Club in the 1950s, quickly becoming the social heart of the small rural community. But with an ageing membership, the club folded in 2016, the once immaculately-trimmed green consumed by weeds and bindi patches. Sold and used for storage, it was back on the market in 2020, a serendipitous time for Davis, who jumped at the opportunity to progress his hobby into a business. Now, with Scenic Rim Mushrooms, he sells pink oysters and freckled chestnuts grown in temperature-controlled rooms to some of the region’s top restaurants as well as visitors who cross the old bowling green to his “farmgate” shop. “Look, I think if you’re passionate about something and if the business plan makes sense, then you should just go for it because we only get one life and you’ve got to have a crack, you know?” he says. Davis’s operation is emblematic of a new generation of small-scale farmers being welcomed into semi-rural Queensland communities. These farming first-timers are happy to take advice while also seeking to do things differently, with diversified income streams and a greater focus on sustainability. Nick Holliday worked in a law firm, as a union organiser and as an air-conditioning technician before buying Belvedere Farm, north-west of Brisbane, in 2014. His intention initially was to live on the property and commute to his job. “But once I started raising cattle and chickens, I became deeply interested in the idea of feeding people, as well as using livestock to building soil organic matter,” he says. In addition to their own eight hectares, Holliday and his wife, Brydie, now lease another 60, still well below the average farm size in Australia of 4,300 hectares. The couple practise agro-ecological farming, using temporary fencing and feeding troughs to rotate cattle around different pastures every day, followed by the chickens, to further aerate and naturally fertilise the soil. On their leased land, an old dairy farm, they’re using pigs to clear lantana and regenerate the degraded soil. To ensure a regular income, the Hollidays operate Belvedere Farm via community-supported agriculture (CSA). Their subscribers buy into the farm’s projected harvest for a set period, receiving monthly deliveries of pork, beef and pastured eggs. Davis, too, has incorporated a subscription model into his business plan, albeit for different reasons. With demand for his Lion’s Mane mushrooms, appreciated for their medicinal as well as culinary benefits, greater than he’s able to supply, his subscribers get first dibs. These loyal customers appreciate the operation’s light environmental footprint, with power for the temperature-controlled rooms provided by solar panels, minimal water use and the mushrooms grown on sawdust, a byproduct of the milling industry. “It’s not just for our conscience – restaurants are really wanting products and producers that are sustainable these days,” Davis says. While both the hands-in-soil and the business end of farming can be a sharp and sometimes devastatingly cruel learning curve, both Davis and Holliday have been gratified by the support they’ve received. “There’s a really awesome movement of new farmers,” Holliday says. “First generation farmers – young people who are undertaking these practices and there are some great mentors, particularly holistic management educators who have adapted methods to an Australian context. We’ve been very lucky to have the opportunity to learn off a lot of other really good farmers.” Davis says the local council, keen to attract tourism to the region, has also provided business development courses and mentorship programs. Jo Sheppard, CEO of Queensland Farmers’ Federation, says many young farmers are “enjoying the diversity modern farming can offer”. This includes “the opportunity to create a sustainable farming enterprise through efficient production, strategic investment decisions and diversification into emerging areas such as agritourism and natural capital.” Kate Keating is the south-east Queensland co-ordinator for Young Farmers Connect, a national not-for-profit network that provides resources and peer support for young farmers. She says small-scale farming is on the increase and proving a boon for the communities they settle in as well as consumers. “They’re fostering strong relationships between grower and consumer and educating people on the true value of food and in doing so, bringing a sense of connection back to our local communities and cities,” she says. For Kate Creasey, of Scenic View Olives, the career transition from event producer and vintage makeup artist to olive farmer necessitated a hasty education in horticulture. “When we moved here, the trees were drought-affected and hadn’t fruited for a couple of years. The previous owner had just sort of lost heart.” But with lots of advice and support, she and her father have managed to double the size of the trees and had two successful fruitings since buying the farm together 18 months ago, she says. “The first season, there were heaps, but they were very small fruit. This year we have a smaller crop, but the fruit is absolutely massive, plumped up with all that extra rain and nutrition. We’ve actually had other growers message us to ask us how we got them so big.” Creasey’s not putting all her eggs (or olives) in one basket though. Like a growing number of farmers, she’s mitigating risk with agritourism, a sector projected by the Queensland Farmers’ Federation to be worth a potential $4.5 billion by 2030. Like Davis, she has a “farmgate stall”, a quaint 1950 Morris bus, formerly used as a broadcast bus for the Melbourne Olympics, restored by her vintage-loving (and olive-loathing) father where she sells jars of olives, tapenades, oil and more. She’s also using her events experience to host weddings and other celebrations in the picturesque olive grove and has renovated a cottage on the property to run as an Airbnb. One thing stopping more people embracing a life on the land is often the start-up capital required to purchase property. “We’ve been very fortunate that I owned this land before the price of land around here accelerated out of the reach of a farmer,” Holliday says. However, QFF says it is increasingly seeing out-of-the-box solutions such as share farming or, as the Hollidays are doing, leasing more land. Demand for Belvedere’s eggs is so great the couple are looking to expand their flock from 300 to 1,000 hens. But while the business is growing exponentially, their life goals remain modest. “We have no aspirations to control huge tracts of land or buy a Maserati,” Holliday says. “We just want to have good jobs and pay ourselves a decent white-collar salary, feed people and heal the country.”",News/Australia news,From bowls club to mushroom farm: how a new generation is reimagining life on the land,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/from-bowls-club-to-mushroom-farm-how-a-new-generation-is-reimagining-life-on-the-land
