3/8/2022,"The bakery chain Greggs has warned of spiralling cost pressures as commodity prices surge following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, adding it will have to raise prices further. Greggs, best known for its sausage rolls and pasties, is expecting overall cost inflation of 6% to 7% this year, and cautioned that the outlook for many commodity costs remains uncertain. This prompted it to put up some prices at the start of this year, and “further changes are expected to be necessary”. Roger Whiteside, the outgoing chief executive, said: “Cost pressures are currently more significant than our initial expectations and, as ever, we will work to mitigate the impact of this on customers, however given this dynamic we do not currently expect material profit progression in the year ahead.” A spokesperson added that Greggs had raised its prices by a “few pennies”, adding 5p to the price of some products, but wanted to remain competitive. Shares in the company fell nearly 9% on Tuesday morning, making Greggs the biggest faller on the FTSE 250. The escalating conflict in Ukraine has sent the price of oil, gas, wheat and many other commodities soaring. The comments came as Greggs swung to a pre-tax profit of nearly £146m in the year to 1 January, from a loss of £13.7m in 2020, its first-ever loss. The profit is higher than its pre-pandemic profit of £108m in 2019. Total sales rose 5.3% to £1.2bn compared with 2019 levels, while like-for-like sales, stripping out new shops, were down 3.3%. In the first nine weeks of 2022, trading improved, with like-for-like sales up 3.7% compared with pre-pandemic levels in 2020. The company will pay a special dividend of 40p a share to investors, and resume its profit-sharing programme for staff, suspended last year when it made a loss. It has vowed to share 10% of its profits among staff every year and will distribute £16.6m this time. A Greggs worker who has been at the company for more than six years on a 20-hour contract will get £800. Despite rising cost pressures, Greggs plans to open 150 new shops every year, eventually taking the total from 2,181 to 3,000 in the UK. It will also extend late opening to 500 shops this year to draw in more customers who are on their way home.Cost pressures also come from rising wages. A pay rise was brought forward by five months, adding £4.5m to costs last year, and Greggs expects wage inflation to be 4.3% this year. Food, packaging and energy prices went up last year as Greggs renewed contracts with suppliers, and expects cost inflation in those areas to increase further this year. On top of this, the full rate of VAT on hot food and drink will be restored at the start of April. John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: “Greggs has benefitted from the return of increased footfall as the UK returned to a more ‘normal’ way of life. “The question is how the business reacts to cost inflation being ahead of its expectations. Greggs has a tricky balancing act to perform on that front, at least in the short to medium term. But the company is well-known for its long-term thinking, which has worked well for it in the past.”",News/Business,Greggs warns of price rises as commodity costs soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/greggs-warns-of-price-rises-as-commodity-costs-soar
3/8/2022,"Finnish director Mika Kaurismäki (elder brother of Aki Kaurismäki) gives us a well-intentioned if watery and bland drama, a decently performed but tepid heartwarmer which can be filed under that dodgiest of sub-headings: “foodie”, that is, something with a supercilious tendency to showcase delicious-seeming food as a shortcut to being life-affirming and life-enhancing. A Chinese widower called Cheng (played by Hong Kong actor Pak Hong Chu) shows up out of the blue in a remote Finnish town with his young son Niu Niu (Lucas Hsuan), and walks into a roadside cafe run by Sirkka (Anna-Maija Tuokko), who is listlessly serving up dull grub for the locals. With no Finnish and only halting English, Cheng asks everyone in the place if they know of “Fongtron”: this mysterious person or business is the reason he’s here. No one can help (and weirdly, it doesn’t occur to anyone to use Google Translate to help with their communication difficulties). Well, Sirrka lets Cheng and his boy stay in a room in her house and, to pay her back, Cheng offers to cook delicious Chinese food for the Chinese tourists who at the moment are deterred from spending their cash in her place because of the unappetising slop she’s offering. Cheng turns out to be a professional chef in Shanghai, with a terribly sad reason for being in Finland. Cheng’s food is a runaway hit, and there’s a spark between him and Sirrka. This is a reasonable enough film, though underpowered, and the truth about “Fongtron” is very perfunctorily revealed and then dismissed. And then there’s the lovingly slow, pointless shots of the food itself, especially over the closing credits. Where’s the bite?

3/8/2022,"Alie Ward “asks smart people stupid questions” with humour and curiosity, grilling scientists on everything from “procyonology” (raccoons) to “genicular traumatology” (bad knees). The joy of this podcast is sitting in on a conversation between a smart layperson and a passionate expert. Ward’s enthusiasm is infectious and interviewees light up under the beam of her interest. A recent episode explores screaming with input from the world’s only “screamologist”: which animals scream? What distinguishes a scream from a yell? Why do we scream when we’re happy, or asleep? And how do screamologists soundproof their offices? As Ward warns, it is “absolutely not soothing whatsoever” – but it’s typically fascinating.Curiosity Daily, with episodes of about 15 minutes, offers more bite-size science. Economist Russ Roberts, of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, hosts this long-running (since 2006: geriatric, in podcast years) “conversation for the curious”, distinguished by its magpie-minded scope. In any given month, Roberts might turn his attention to astrophysics, reforming government and underground fungi, often but not always through an economics lens. A recent interview with the film-maker Penny Lane about her documentary on the smooth-jazz saxophonist Kenny G is fascinating as an insight into what art we value and what we deride. You’ll end each hour-long episode with a smart take on a subject you might previously have thought little about. If you enjoy EconTalk, try Freakonomics Radio and The Ezra Klein Show, which are similarly expert-led and horizon-broadening. A leading historian or knowledgable guest is asked: if they could travel back through time, which year would they visit? Billed as a blend of “serious history and playful parlour game”, the strength of this podcast is in the narrow slice of the past it presents, from the Athens of 450BC to London in AD62, India in 1837 and the moon in 1969. Often these stories shed light on an unsung historical figure, and still have resonance today. As co-host Artemis Irvine says of the episode about the “hidden case” of trans man Ewan Forbes half a century ago, Travels Through Time is a reminder of “why studying history is so important for understanding the present”. Also recommended are Dan Snow’s History Hit (broader in scope, with less storytelling) and, from across the pond, Revolutions (detailed play-by-plays of historical uprisings – now: the French revoluti). Michael Hobbes and Aubrey Gordon hold this lively conversation pod debunking the junk science “behind health fads, wellness scams and nonsensical nutrition advice”. The hour-long episodes are fastidiously researched but lightly delivered, with careful attention to the scientific literature and inclusivity. The recent episodes on the fallacies underpinning the reported “sleep loss epidemic”, the contemporary culture of protein and the “scientif-ish” body mass index will open your mind to the hollow basis of much conventional wellness wisdom. Listening to Maintenance Phase is like hearing your smart, straight-talking friend respond to you idly wondering if you should try a keto diet. Another pod, No Stupid Questions from the makers of Freakonomics, takes a similar conversational format to a broader range of topics, in a more compact format. Amid everyday chaos, there’s something anchoring about turning to the numbers. From Radio 4, More Or Less takes a sober, succinct view of instances of “statistical bother” in the news – including, sometimes, the BBC’s own output. A recent episode reviewed Boris Johnson’s repeated claims to parliament about less crime and more jobs and found them to be, uh, lacking. Or, as the mild-mannered and often drily funny host Tim Harford put it: “Crikey, that’s a big number to overlook.” Other episodes explore the five-second rule when dropping food, falling fertility rates and the placebo effect. (Harford’s other, similarly edifying podcast, Cautionary Tales – stories to “delight you, scare you, but also make you wiser” – is returning soon.)

3/8/2022,"Two key congressional races along the Texas-Mexico border underscore what Latino political analysts have been screaming for years: as a voting bloc, Hispanics are not a politically homogeneous group. So Democrats must have a more nuanced strategy to win the bloc if they want to recapture political power in the state, and extend that power to the US Congress. Both congressional districts, which were up for grabs in last week’s Texas primary, begin at the Rio Grande and snake north-east to San Antonio, among the largest cities in state. One of them, the 28th congressional district, which emanates from Laredo, captured the hopes of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. The other, the 15th district, which begins in McAllen, further south, has Republicans excited about the prospects of turning that district Republican for the first time in its history, with the help of newly redrawn district lines. The lessons learned from those two races could be instructive at the top of the ticket in November. Democrats are excited about the prospects of Beto O’Rourke, from the border town of El Paso, upsetting Republican governor Greg Abbott, who must demonstrate his ability to capture the Hispanic vote to be credible on the national stage in 2024. Much of the state’s focus in last Tuesday’s primary was on the potential upset of nine-term Congressman Henry Cuellar by his former intern, Jessica Cisneros, who drew the support of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The two ended up in a runoff election set for 24 May. Cuellar’s race represents a rematch with Cisneros. Cuellar, a native of Laredo who is arguably the most powerful Texas Democrat in Congress, draws the ire of progressive Democrats who note his anti-abortion stance and his negotiations with Republicans, particularly when it came to funding President Trump’s border wall. His challenge was made more complicated when the FBI raided his home and office in Laredo in a federal investigation involving business dealings with the country of Azerbaijan. Cuellar has denied any wrongdoing and he has not been charged with anything. But the timing of the raid placed enormous clouds on his electoral prospects with early voting happening just a few weeks later. He eked out a 767-vote win over Cisneros. Two years earlier, he beat her by 2,690 votes. And while Cisneros, who is also from Laredo, likely benefited enormously from the cloud of corruption over her opponent, where her votes came from is telling. The bulk of her votes came from Bexar county, the home of San Antonio, hours from the border. Cisneros polled under 40% in border counties. All of this suggests that Cuellar’s more conservative approach to politics better resonated with voters along the border. Further south of the 28th district is the 15th congressional district, a Democratic mainstay newly redrawn by the state legislature to favor Republicans. The GOP has dominated state politics since 1994, but the border region from south Texas to El Paso in the far west portion of the state has had an insurmountable blue wall. The 15th had shared in that Democratic tradition and was once represented by John Nance Garner who went on to become Franklin D Roosevelt’s first vice-president. After the 2020 election, in which Trump did exceptionally well in the district, Republicans made the 15th a focal point. That interest grew when Republican insurance agent and businesswoman Monica De La Cruz came within 3 percentage points of upsetting the Democratic incumbent Vicente Gonzalez in 2020. That same year, Trump came within 2 percentage points of President Biden in the district – the narrowest margin of any seat held by a Democrat in Texas. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall after redistricting, Gonzalez left the 15th district to run in another district. When the legislature completed its once-a-decade redistricting process, the 15th was reshaped to enhance GOP prospects even more. In 2020, before redistricting, Biden carried the 15th by 50.4% to Trump’s 48.5%. Redistricting would have flipped those numbers, delivering a victory to Trump. Last Tuesday, De La Cruz coasted to the Republican nomination and drew more votes than the two candidates in the Democratic primary combined. While the redistricting process all but guarantees a Republican advantage in the 15th in November, south Texas overall has emerged as a Petri dish for political analysts trying to unlock the mystery to winning over Hispanic voters just as Hispanics are expected to become the majority in Texas by 2025. Hispanics who live along the border are much more conservative than Texas Democrats overall. One of the region’s open secrets is the large number of DINOs (Democrat in Name Only) that are in leadership positions. Many officials, locals quietly say, run as Democrats whether they believe in the party platform or not because running as a Republican has generally been the kiss of death. But during the Trump administration, Trump trains or caravans of cars expressing support for the former president became almost commonplace in Hidalgo county, the southern anchor of the 15th district. As one Trump supporter told me, it has become easier to come out of the Republican closet over the past few years with growing numbers of people declaring allegiance to Trump based on economic and border security issues. Then there’s the Viva Kennedy factor showing that some aspects of politics can have long memories. In 1960, when John F Kennedy ran against Richard Nixon for president, his campaign began Hispanic outreach through what were called Viva Kennedy clubs. A key conduit for this outreach was a Corpus Christi doctor named Hector P Garcia, who started the American G.I. Forum, a group that fought for equal rights for Hispanic soldiers returning from the second world war. Given Kennedy’s close victory, Garcia and other Hispanic leaders felt that the Mexican American vote had been key to his win. They expected to share in the political spoils that many leaders say never came until Lyndon Johnson became president. Since Biden took office, several Texas Hispanic leaders have spoken privately of having Viva Kennedy sentiments because Hispanics, particularly in Texas, have not fared as well politically as they had hoped with a Democrat in the White House. This feeling is exacerbated by Biden’s missteps on the issue of immigration. While security is important to border Hispanics (the US Border Patrol has long been a ticket to the middle class locally), the rhetoric of immigration can often stray into language that Hispanics find offensive. The perception that Biden has not handled the issue of immigration well leads to a perception that his administration is allowing the issue of xenophobia to fester unchallenged. This sets the stage for this year’s midterm election. De La Cruz moved early last year to take on the incumbent again and was bolstered by Republican leadership at the state and national levels. Last fall, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy endorsed De La Cruz. She also secured Trump’s endorsement. If money is a political barometer, then De La Cruz stands out among the 14 candidates, Democrat and Republican, who filed for the congressional seat. As of 9 February, she raised more than $1.7m, according to the Federal Elections Commission. That’s more than twice the amount raised by the next candidate, Republican Mauro Garza, who raised just over $500,000. Astoundingly, from a historic perspective in this traditionally Democratic stronghold, the top Democratic fund-raiser banked just over $300,000. And the two Democrats from the 15th that appear to be headed into a May runoff to oppose De La Garza raised a combined $220,000. Last week, De La Cruz became the Republican nominee for the 15th congressional district by capturing 56.5% of the GOP vote. Her vote total of 16,801 beat the combined total of the two Democrats that are headed into a runoff. The political strength of Monica De La Cruz, who would become the third Latina and first Republican Latina from Texas in Congress, is worth noting. The heterogeneity of the Hispanic vote cannot be overlooked; the party that better addresses the complexities of this electorate will be the party that has a better chance of controlling the political future of Texas.

3/8/2022,"League: NBA Years in job: Started 2014 Estimated salary: $10m Just three months after succeeding David Stern, Silver was given a trial by fire after the release of tapes in which LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling used racist slurs. Silver’s response, highlighted by the often memed “Banned for Life!”, brought him plaudits, perhaps most crucially from the players themselves. Silver’s quick and decisive reaction set the tone for what has been a successful tenure thus far. It hasn’t been without its hiccups of course: The handling of Daryl Morey’s comments on China didn’t have the same forthright morality that Silver exhibited during the Sterling affair (although it was perhaps an unwinnable situation given the NBA’s commitment to global growth.) Additionally, there are some valid arguments that he has allowed players to force moves to big-market teams too easily, an issue that the NBA may need to mitigate at some point. But the bumps pale in comparison to the successes: Silver navigated the Covid-19 pandemic about as well as could be expected; he is popular with players due to the importance he places on social justice; he has continued Stern’s global NBA push with NBA Africa; and he has even been open to innovation in the form of a midseason tournament, which could be his lasting legacy for better or for worse. More work needs to be done to combat tanking, while the regular season needs to be far more appealing, But, all in all, Silver has been fine. Which, given some of his contemporaries, puts him comfortably top of this list. League: MLS Years in job: Started 1999 Estimated salary: $5m Garber’s critics will point to the Columbus Crew relocation debacle. But it’s undeniable that Garber was the right person to take soccer to the next level on and off the pitch in North America. He played a major role in saving the league from folding in the early 2000s while also managing a treacherous decades-long expansion process. During his time in charge, MLS has grown in stature, shaking off its “retirement league” label for a “developmental” one. It’s not perfect of course, the aforementioned Crew spat worked out in Garber’s favor but has tainted his legacy and could have outright ruined it had the franchise moved. The creation of SUM (Soccer United Marketing) was a financial boon to US Soccer and it’s hard to see the MLS in its current state without him. League: WNBA Years in job: Started 2019 Estimated salary: unknown The former Deloitte CEO was a trailblazer in the corporate world, and it’s that sound business background that made her an ideal candidate to run the WNBA. The early signs are good: last season’s viewership for the WNBA finals was up 23% from 2020. Engelbert has got through her first years in power relatively unscathed, navigating the pandemic and a clash over a Republican senator’s co-ownership of the Atlanta Dream. But recently she’s found herself in a dispute over charter flights that has spiraled into a debate over working conditions for female athletes. Her main focus has been to change how companies look at women’s sports. In a statement early in her tenure, she made that mission clear: “Less than 5% of corporate sponsorship money goes to women’s sports and less than 5% of media coverage. My goal is to get both up to 10%. That will improve the player experience, fan engagement – and all tides will rise.” Her legacy will largely be defined on her ability to pull that goal off. League: NFL Years in job: Started 2006 Estimated salary: $63.9m Goodell is currently negotiating a contract extension and he can probably demand whatever he wants. Is this due to his expert handling of issues on and off the field? Far from it, from the arbitrary nature of suspensions to Deflategate, Ray Rice, CTE, diversity in coaching and Colin Kaepernick, his record is far from pristine. That said, Goodell does one thing very well: making the league money. The NFL’s annual revenue were $6.5bn in 2006, the year he assumed his role; in 2019 they had risen to $15.2bn. Goodell has thrown himself on grenade after grenade to protect the NFL owners’ interests and shield them from scrutiny. He’s the ultimate heel and more importantly, he appears happy to be one (and on that salary, who can blame him?) Besides, it’s hard to argue with his business record, even if his ethics can be debated. The NFL has seen record growth under his watch, he’s allowed NFL RedZone – perhaps the greatest media invention in sports – to exist, he’s revamped the offseason schedule to ensure the NFL is relevant year-round, and he’s been able to secure both an extra regular season and playoff game in a sport that’s built on tradition. Goodell may be divisive but he’s far from incompetent when it comes to making the NFL’s owners and players richer. League: NHL Years in job: started 1993 Estimated salary: $7.5m It’s hard to look past the three lockouts under Bettman’s watch, especially as one of them lasted an entire season. 2004-05 still holds the dubious honor of being the first time a major North American sport lost an entire season due to labor disputes. Hockey had cultural cache in the US in the 1980s and 90s, much of which has now fizzled out. Bettman of course isn’t solely to blame but it’s worth noting he did not inherit a failing sport. 2004-05 inflicted long-term damage on a sport that, while perhaps geographically niche in the US, had (and still has) appeal to a modern audience. Bettman’s failure to jettison archaic rules and change with the times have been well noted. Bettman allowed the defensive trap-style hockey in the early aughts to stymie excitement and made the sport unappealing to many casual fans. Misguided attempts to force hockey into warmer climates instead of traditional markets hurt legacy fans. Bettman’s poor handling of the issues surrounding the Chicago Blackhawks’ sexual assault cover-up, the Arizona Coyotes’ stadium, the NHL’s long-standing cultural issues and the league’s seemingly optional salary cap rules, which are too easily circumvented, certainly do him no favors. But hey, he got the NHL on ESPN/TNT and away from OLN which is a plus. League: MLB Years in job: Started 2015 Estimated salary: $11m The long-running narrative surrounding Rob Manfred is damning: no one is sure if he even likes baseball. Frustration with Manfred has come to a boil again in recent weeks after the start of the new season was delayed and games canceled due to a lockout. But even before then, Manfred had the uncanny ability to make problems worse while trying to fix them. His attempts to modernize the game have angered traditionalists while failing to attract new fans. He’s taken a scythe to the minor leagues, essentially curtailing organic growth of the sport at the lower levels in an era where baseball is seeing soccer getting close to stealing third base. He famously botched punishment for the Astros in their cheating scandal, video replay started disastrously, there was the juiced baseballs fiasco and now he’s essentially advocating for a lockout at the behest of the owners. But perhaps on a personal level, nothing was more egregious than dismissing the World Series trophy as “a piece of metal” in an attempt to temper outrage after the Astros cheating scandal. Baseball should be able to survive in the US on its nostalgia value alone. Yet Manfred seems determined to strip MLB of the illusions that make sports what they are. Yes, we know deep down that trophies are just pieces of metal, but we really don’t want the person in charge of the sport telling us that. League: NWSL Marla Messing won’t be around too much longer after taking the reins as interim commissioner in the wake of the abuse scandals that rocked the NWSL in 2021 and led to the resignation of her predecessor, Lisa Baird. Messing is a career sports executive who played a major role in the landmark moment for women’s soccer in the US: the 1999 Women’s World Cup. She has been adamant about the focus for the league in the present: Cleaning out the gutter before major steps can be made. “Let me just be crystal clear, our first objective is to get our house in order and to make sure that we are meeting the minimum standards of a professional league and addressing the issues that the players want and deserve us to address,” Messing said. For the NWSL the next appointment will be pivotal – the women’s game is finally getting more international recognition and the next commissioner could perhaps be the Don Garber for US women’s soccer.",Sport/Sport,Ranking North America’s best sports commissioners (and Rob Manfred),https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/08/ranking-north-americas-best-sports-commissioners-and-rob-manfred

The Danish toymaker said it had gained market share around the world in 2021 but warned that growth would slow to less than 10% this year as schools and workplaces reopen. Niels Christiansen, the chief executive of Lego, said: “In 2021 we saw the benefits of strategic investments made over the past three years to innovate our portfolio, expand and evolve our retail experiences and increase capacity within our global supply chain network.” As it celebrates its 90th year in 2022, Lego said sales reached Dkr55.3bn (£6.2bn) while profits hit Dkr17bn (£1.9bn), despite increased freight and raw material costs for its plastic bricks, as it recorded a big shift to selling directly to consumers online. Bestsellers included Lego City, which includes child-friendly sets to make train stations or helicopters, as well as Harry Potter, Star Wars and Lego Technic, all of which appeal to adults as well as youngsters. Lego also increased direct sales to consumers by opening 165 new stores around the world, including more than 90 in China, taking its total to 832 by the end of last year.

3/8/2022,"Hitler insults, shamanistic intrigue and some colourful language for good measure. It was always going to be difficult for South Korea to match the vitriol surrounding Park Geun-hye’s dramatic removal from office five years ago over corruption charges for which she would spend more than three years in prison. But the campaign leading up to Wednesday’s election for the country’s next president has given even Park’s chaotic exit a run for its money. The world’s 10th-biggest economy is likely to require a period of national reconciliation after weeks of rancour that some have likened to the hit South Korean Netflix series Squid Game, although no one is suggesting the price of failure will come via the barrel of a submachine gun. Unlike the election’s 2017 iteration, when the left-leaning Moon Jae-in was swept into the presidential Blue House by an electorate enraged by Park’s abuse of power, this week’s vote is still too close to call. After two years of the Covid-19 pandemic and rising disquiet over the cost of living – against a backdrop of a ferocious gender war – Moon’s Democratic party heir apparent, Lee Jae-myung, is behind in the polls. The most recent survey, taken a week before Wednesday’s vote, put Yoon Suk-yeol, the conservative challenger from the People Power party, marginally ahead. The ghosts of Park, the daughter of a former South Korean dictator who in 2012 was elected the country’s first female president, appeared early in the current campaign, when Yoon and his wife were accused of having ties to a shamanistic healer who, in return for advice, had been given a decision-making role. The claims were particularly damaging for Yoon, who, ironically, had been part of the legal team that pursued Park after her impeachment: her downfall began with revelations that she had allowed a longtime friend, whose late father was the leader of an obscure religious cult, to influence policy. For a while, some wondered if spiritualism was again going to help determine South Korea’s political future. Park aside, Kim Dae-jung, who was elected in 1998, reportedly won after moving the location of his father’s grave on the advice of a shaman. Media reports claimed that if Yoon was elected, his wife would change the location of the Blue House’s guest accommodation, having been told to do so by a shaman. They are not alone: Yoon Yeo-joon, a former environment minister, suggested it would be easier to count the number of South Korean politicians and business leaders who did not pick up the phone to a trusted shaman before making an important decision. But by last month, the shamanism row dimmed, amid claims that senior figures in the Democratic party may also have been present at a ritual where Yoon and his wife were reportedly named as guests. That did not give way to a more civilised campaign, however. Instead, it has been described as a revenge mission by conservatives still loyal to Park, who was pardoned late last year. “This year’s presidential election has been more overwhelmed by negative campaigning than any other previous election, and the mutual hatred won’t easily die down after the election,” said Choi Jin, the director of the Institute of Presidential Leadership in Seoul. While voters demand action on skyrocketing house prices in Seoul, stagnant growth and youth unemployment, the two frontrunners have continued to trade insults and fend off allegations of impropriety. Yoon accused Lee’s party of using the tactics of Hitler and Mussolini, while Lee’s allies described Yoon as a “dictator” and “an empty can”. Lee, who is being scrutinised over a suspect land development deal, opened his campaign with an apology for a profanity-laden family phone call and has been dogged by rumours of links to organised crime. Yoon, meanwhile, has made several gaffes, most recently a “tone deaf” – and now-deleted – tweet about Ukraine that included a tangerine with an angry face drawn on it in an apparent reference to the country’s 2004 Orange revolution. The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper spoke for many South Korean when it questioned the candidates’ priorities. “Isn’t our national future too bleak with an unpleasant and bitter presidential election that calls for choosing the lesser of two evils?” it asked in a recent editorial. Faced with an angry electorate, the worst coronavirus wave of the pandemic and a North Korea that has rediscovered its penchant for ballistic missile tests, it may be that political reality quickly supersedes campaign acrimony as the winner prepares to take office in early May. Yet despite promises from Yoon and Lee during a recent TV debate not to launch politically motivated investigations against the defeated candidate, many fear the mud-slinging will continue long after the election. “We now have an election race like Squid Game, but it will be the new president’s responsibility to pull us out of it,” said Cho Jinman, a professor at Duksung Women’s University in Seoul.

Now 83, Ullmann is a bona fide cinema legend; an actor of supreme daring, intelligence and empathy – and a formidable director too. She is best known for her work with the Swedish dramatist Ingmar Bergman. Together, they made 10 films, including Persona (1966), The Passion of Anna (1969), Cries and Whispers (1972), Face to Face (1976) and Autumn Sonata (1978). They also had a daughter, Linn. Ullmann was born in Tokyo and had a traumatic early life: her grandfather died at Dachau after being sent there for helping Jews escape from his Norwegian town; her parents moved to Toronto and then New York for her father’s work as an aircraft engineer, but he died after being struck by a propeller – a loss that greatly affected the young Ullmann. Her mother moved back to Norway with her two daughters and worked as a bookseller; Ullmann began her career on stage, with a landmark Nora in A Doll’s House in mid 1950s Norway. She repeated the role in 1975 on Broadway, where she later starred in reportedly extraordinary productions of Ghosts and Anna Christie. She has not made a movie for eight years, since she directed a highly effective and intense adaptation of Miss Julie in 2014, starring Jessica Chastain and Colin Farrell. It was her third film behind the camera, following Sofie (1992) and Faithless (2000), the latter a big Cannes hit, with a script by Bergman, loosely based on his own infidelities. Hers is a career of extreme taste and also of sparing choices. The list of roles Ullmann has turned down is almost as long as those she’s won awards for: a character written especially for her by Soderbergh in Ocean’s 12, a character in Sex and the City, Angie Dickinson’s role in Dressed to Kill, and Emelie Ekdahl in Fanny and Alexander, Bergman’s final feature. Another ghost on the CV is her passion project of filming A Doll’s House, with Kate Winslet and Cate Blanchett both linked to star in her adaptation. It never happened, though Ullmann did direct the latter on stage in A Streetcar Named Desire in Sydney. I met Ullmann eight years ago and was bowled over by how accessible and clear-sighted she was. She was also present and emotional in a way few drop-dead famous icons of cinema manage. Somehow, Ullmann’s humanity has remained completely intact. We’d like your questions for her, please. Post them in the comments below; these will close at noon on 11 March. Her responses will be published on 25 March.",Arts/Film,Post your questions for Liv Ullmann,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/08/post-your-questions-for-liv-ullmann
3/8/2022,"There were emotional scenes on day four of the Winter Paralympics in Beijing as Ukrainian athletes completed two podium sweeps at the National Biathlon Centre in Zhangjiakou. Iryna Bui won the women’s standing 10km race nearly 13 seconds ahead of her compatriot Oleksandra Kononova in silver. Liudmyla Liashenko took bronze. In the men’s middle distance vision impaired biathlon, Vitaliy Lukyanenko came out on top by nearly 45 seconds as Ukrainian para biathletes finished in the top five places in the race. Anatoliy Kovalevskyi and Dmytro Suiarko won the silver and bronze. In the para biathlon for visually impaired athletes, rather than shoot at targets with bullets, competitors use a laser-rifle, with an audio signal transmitted via headphones. The closer the aim is to the bull’s eye, the higher the frequency of sound heard by the athlete. Ukraine’s Oksana Shyshkova nearly added her third gold of these Games in the middle-distance vision impaired category biathlon, but with two misses in the shooting she fell agonisingly short, finishing 3.7 seconds behind Germany’s 18-year-old Leonie Maria Walter, who added gold to her previous two bronze medals. There was a US one-two in the women’s sitting middle-distance biathlon when Ukraine-born Oksana Masters picked up a 13th combined career medal at the Winter and Summer Paralympics with a silver behind team-mate Kendall Gretsch. Masters led for two-thirds of the 10km course, but despite picking up one shooting penalty, Gretsch finished 8.7 seconds ahead in the end. Liu Mengtao won China’s eighth gold medal of the Games in the men’s sitting event. China lead the way in the medal table, with eight golds and 27 medals in total. Ukraine are second with six golds, and Canada third with five golds after Mark Arendz won the men’s 10km standing biathlon. Great Britain’s wheelchair curlers continued to make progress towards qualification for the semi-finals. The quartet of Gregor Ewan, Hugh Nibloe, Meggan Dawson-Farrell and David Melrose defeated Estonia 10-5 in the early morning session in Beijing in a match which swung in the fifth end when four points for the British team stretched their lead to 9-4, and Estonia could not recover. With three wins and two defeats in their opening five matches, the British team are placed joint fourth with defending champions China in the round robin stage, which is being led by Canada and Latvia. The British team have five matches remaining, and will face third-placed Sweden at 11.35am UK time on Tuesday. In the para ice hockey contest Canada secured their spot in the semi-finals with a comprehensive 6-0 victory over South Korea at the Beijing National Indoor Stadium. James Dunn scored a hat-trick for the 2018 silver-medallists. South Korea now face a quarter-final play-off on Wednesday. The group stage concludes on Tuesday, with hosts China, who are already guaranteed a quarter-final spot, taking on Italy, and Slovakia facing the Czech Republic in group B to decide the final play-off spots. Defending champions the US are seeking their fifth Paralympic title, and have already progressed through to the semi-finals, which take place on Friday. Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 Olympic organising committee for the Olympics and Paralympics has supported the ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes competing in the Beijing Paralympics. He told French newspaper Midi Libre: “The sports world has always tried to keep athletes away from politics. Given the gravity of the situation, it required going a step further, including making decisions that may impact athlete participation. Everything you normally want to avoid. But in a serious and exceptional situation, serious and exceptional measure. I understand that and I support it.” He also offered direct support for Ukrainian athletes, saying that the Paris 2024 team had already made donations to relief efforts, and had been asked to help athletes who had been training in France to return home. Of those currently in China he said “I have a special thought of support for the Ukrainian athletes who will compete in extremely difficult conditions, but who will be keen to defend the colours of their country.” The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has announced the winners of its 2022 International Women’s Day Recognition Awards. New Zealand’s Paralympics Committee was rewarded for its effort to strive for gender equality, while Zimbabwe’s coach Oripa Mubika and Singapore’s Paralympic champion Yip Pin Xiu were also recognised.

3/8/2022,"The British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has admitted the process for bringing Ukrainian refugees to the UK has “not been quick enough” and that it has been made more difficult by sending refugees to Paris from Calais. He said efforts by the Ukrainians had shown that Vladimir Putin would not win the war in Ukraine and that the country would be impossible to occupy. “You try occupying a country the size of France and Germany put together with 44 million people,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “This will be Putin’s end, this country, and so it should be, because of not only their spirit and their moral purpose on their side, the Ukrainians, but also because it will be an impossible task to occupy such a people in a country.” Wallace expressed frustration when asked about the issues with visas, and said he was “not the home secretary” but that he had been assured that changes would be made. The home secretary, Priti Patel, told MPs on Monday that “we have staff in Calais, we have support on the ground” but the Home Office later said that a new processing centre for visas would be set up “en route to Calais” where refugees have been turned away at the crossing, having driven across Europe. On Monday afternoon, there were still signs telling refugees to go to centres in Paris or Brussels. About 300 visas have been issued for Ukrainians with relatives in the UK, compared with about 1,800 in Ireland, 30,000 in Germany and half a million in Poland. Wallace said that the MoD would give operation support to processing visas but acknowledged the process had been flawed. “It’s difficult for those people – why wouldn’t it be? – to go all the way back to Paris,” Wallace told BBC Breakfast. “We need to upscale it, I know that the home secretary has already doubled, or trebled in some cases, more people in different processing centres. We can do more, we will do more. “It’s not the case that we are only allowing 300 people in, it is the case that the system has not been quick enough, which is what we’re going to address.” Wallace said that Putin had misjudged the effects the war would have on the people of Russia. “Whatever we think about President Putin, he is done. He is a spent force in the world. No one will be taking his phone calls in the long term,” Wallace said. “He has exhausted his army, he is responsible for thousands of Russian soldiers being killed, responsible for innocent people being killed, civilians being killed in Ukraine. He is reducing his economy to zero, because the international community has decided that is absolutely unacceptable, what he’s done. “So he is a spent force in the world and I don’t know whether he thinks that’s a clever thing to be, but that diminishes his own country in the world and he has to take responsibility for that.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will speak to MPs in a historic video address, the first time such an address has been facilitated in the House of Commons chamber. Wallace said he had been “privileged to meet” Zelenskiy and praised his leadership.“He is young, he is modern, his values are what President Putin hates, and that is why President Putin is so determined to try to snuff out the values of Ukraine. Well, we are not going to let that happen.”",News/World news,"UK ‘has not been quick enough’ on Ukrainian refugees, admits Ben Wallace",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukrainian-refugees-uk-ben-wallace
3/8/2022,"Five debut novels have been longlisted for the 2022 Women’s prize for fiction, including Build Your House Around My Body by Violet Kupersmith, called “marvellous and confounding” by the Guardian, and Barack Obama’s book list pick The Final Revival of Opal & Nev by Dawnie Walton. These novels are up against Booker shortlisted Great Circle by Maggie Shipstead and The Exhibitionist by Charlotte Mendelson, who was shortlisted for the 2008 prize. Mendelson is joined on the longlist by four more authors who have been previously nominated: Elif Shafak, Leone Ross, Catherine Chidgey and Rachel Elliott. Yet the popular authors Sally Rooney and Hanya Yanagihara, who have both been selected in previous years, didn’t make the cut this year. The Bread the Devil Knead by Lisa Allen-Agostini (Myriad) Salt Lick by Lulu Allison (Unbound)  Careless by Kirsty Capes (Orion) Remote Sympathy by Catherine Chidgey (Europa) The Paper Palace by Miranda Cowley Heller (Viking) Flamingo by Rachel Elliott (Tinder) The Sentence by Louise Erdrich (Corsair) Build Your House Around My Body by Violet Kupersmith (Oneworld)  Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason (Weidenfeld) The Exhibitionist by Charlotte Mendelson (Mantle) The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki (Canongate) This One Sky Day by Leone Ross (Faber) The Island of Missing Trees by Elif Shafak (Viking) Great Circle by Maggie Shipstead (Doubleday) The Final Revival of Opal & Nev by Dawnie Walton (Quercus) Creatures of Passage by Morowa Yejidé (Jacaranda) Chair of judges Mary Ann Sieghart attributed the fact that “a lot of very well-known authors didn’t make it to the longlist and five debut novelists did” to the debuts simply being “brilliant books”. “Why people are starting to write brilliant books, and managing to do so with their first novel, I can’t really answer … but is it possible that perhaps during the first lockdown people thought, you know what, I’ve always wanted to write a novel, maybe I’ll give it a go?” Many of the novels that were eligible for this year’s prize were written during the coronavirus pandemic, a reason why, Sieghart thinks, quite a few of the submissions were dystopian novels. Other common themes among the novels the judges considered were lesbian relationships and female friendship, but what struck Sieghart about the books “was a diversity rather than the homogeneity of them”. Any woman writing in English is eligible for the award, and this year the longlist of 16 is made up of five British authors, six Americans, two New Zealanders, one Turkish-British, one American-Canadian, and one Trinidadian writer. Sieghart said that after a “harmonious” judging session, she and her fellow judges, Lorraine Candy, Dorothy Koomson, Anita Sethi and Pandora Sykes “discovered we’d picked a fantastically diverse list”. She added: “We didn’t have to make any sort of corrections to try to get a good variety of subject matter or nationality of author or ethnicity of author or genre, it was just all there. So that was rather wonderful.” A quarter of the books on the list are published by independent presses, with three publishing houses, Unbound, Myriad Editions and Europa Editions, having a book on the longlist for the first time. The shortlist will be revealed on 27 April and the winner on 15 June. Established in 1996, after the Booker prize failed to shortlist any women five years earlier, the Women’s prize is intended “to celebrate and promote fiction by women to the widest range of readers possible”. Former winners include Piranesi by Susanna Clarke and Zadie Smith’s On Beauty.",Arts/Books,Five debut novels make Women’s prize for fiction longlist ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/08/womens-prize-for-fiction-longlist-five-debut-novels
3/8/2022,"A misogyny act for Scotland, created exclusively for women to crack down on street harassment, organised online hate and an onslaught of rape and disfigurement threats, has been recommended to the Scottish government by Helena Kennedy. Set up in February 2021 to consider the creation of a standalone offence of misogynist hate crime, Lady Kennedy’s working group has returned a far more ambitious report that recommends naming explicitly the daily abuses that “absolutely degrade women’s lives”. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian as she launches the report, Kennedy says she aims to use law as a tool for cultural change, shift the dial to focus on perpetrator rather than women’s behaviour, and set the bar for change across the rest of the UK. After a year in which there has been mass mobilisation of women in response to individual tragedies like the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, revelations of embedded misogyny in the Met and Police Scotland, and ongoing anger at how women are expected to manage their own safety, Kennedy is blunt about the need for a “transformative” change. The proposed Misogyny and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act would create a new statutory misogyny aggravation operating outside of current hate crime legislation, as well as new offences of stirring up hatred against women and girls – designed to target the growing influence of “incel” culture – public misogynistic harassment, and issuing threats of, or invoking, rape, sexual assault or disfigurement of women and girls online and offline. It is time to “burst the balloon” of equality before the law, argues Kennedy, a campaigning human rights barrister of five decades, and create legislation that “concentrates the mind” of police, prosecutors, defenders and judges on women’s daily experience. “What’s become clear to me is that if you don’t deal with the everyday stuff, you’ll never ever deal with the underlying problem, which leads to rape, the killing of women, the horrible abuse that we know all too well,” she said. “You’ve got to deal with a whole continuum.” She is aware that critics will suggest such proposals could lead to prosecutions for wolf-whistling and are a waste of criminal justice resources. “The way to minimise this is always to say men can’t say: ‘You look lovely today.’ Women are not going to report that to the police, but where women are made to feel that their life is undermined by male conduct, that is abusive, humiliating, degrading, the police have to make space for it and make resources available.” Extensive research by the group into women’s experience – from the aggressive propositioning of women in hijab to sexual threats issued to girls leaving the school gates – revealed that women are “not aware of [existing laws that might protect them] and the police don’t reach for it”. By specifically enacting a misogyny bill “you’re telling women there is special law made available for them”, Kennedy explains. “I want the police to be saying, when when something happens to a woman, is this misogyny or not?” Calls to treat misogynist abuse – and in particular street harassment – as a hate crime have been spearheaded in England by Labour’s Stella Creasy, though MPs voted down a Lords amendment to do just that at the end of February. Although Kennedy had supported Creasy’s campaign in the Lords, she believes hate crime is the wrong vehicle. Women are not a minority group, which hate crime protections were designed for, and – as the report states – “misogyny is so deeply rooted in our patriarchal ecosystem that it requires a more fundamental set of responses”. The group’s formation coincided with a toxic row about the Scottish government’s hate crime bill, its protections for both women and transgender individuals, and whether to add sex to the list of other protected characteristics, such as race and religion. The report is clear: “It is our preferred view that no offence should be created that requires a woman to prove that she is a woman.” Misogynist offending occurs on a continuum, she says, “and this lower level stuff creates a normalising of behaviours that can eventually lead to much graver offending against women”. But even without escalation, “this lower level stuff absolutely degrades women’s lives, women choose not to put themselves in the public domain, women don’t go out late in the evening, women have to circumscribe their lives because of male behaviour. We have to do something about that”.",News/UK news,Report urges Scottish government to introduce misogyny act,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/08/slugs-misogyny-act-scotland-helena-kennedy-working-group-repor
3/8/2022,"“Putin must fail.” These are the words of the British prime minister, Boris Johnson. The way to do this is via all-out economic warfare, not the weak sanctions and half-measures that have been put in place so far. All political, diplomatic, military and economic means, short of war with Russia, must be deployed in synergy to ensure Ukraine continues to resist and Russia weakens and fails. Providing weapons, supplies and intelligence to the Ukrainian armed forces is key. But much more must be done right now to wage economic warfare to undermine Putin’s capacity to continue this war. We need to deplete Russian state income by limiting its trade with the west. Every day, the US, UK and EU buy more than $700m worth of oil, gas and other commodities from Russia. Some of Russia’s largest state-owned companies, which are key for commodities trading, have not been sanctioned. Economies in Europe, especially Germany and Italy, must start preparing now for life without Russian gas and threaten a full embargo. In the financial sector, we must impose blanket sanctions against all Belarusian and Russian banks and put them on the US specially designated nationals list – which will block their assets and make it illegal for anyone in the US to do business with them. All Russian and Belarusian banks should be disconnected from the world’s main banking messaging service, Swift. Sanctions should be imposed on rouble clearing, ​meaning no transactions in roubles are possible and in effect trade is blocked, and there must be a full ban on US and UK public sector pension funds from holding Russian assets. Cryptocurrency wallets linked to Russia should be identified and seized. Finally, the 5,000 members of the Russian political, economic and military elite and their families must be banned from obtaining visas to the UK, US and EU. These privileges should be reinstated to anybody publicly declaring that they disagree with Vladimir Putin’s war and resigning. And if those in control of the military operation in Ukraine are seeking another off-ramp, they could defect now and be granted immunity for war crimes, which should be investigated by a special tribunal into the aggression against Ukraine. We know that sanctions work. At the very start of Russian aggression against Ukraine, the US, EU and UK acted swiftly – freezing a large part of the Russian central nank’s $638bn reserves was a significant blow. Roughly $403bn of the bank’s foreign exchange reserves are held in dollars, euros, pounds and other western currencies. Russia now cannot access these funds. A range of Russian banks were cut off from the Swift payments system, which will effectively block the country from importing and exporting from and to the EU. About 80% of the Russian banking sector is currently under US sanctions. The impact of these measures on the Russian economy is already substantial and will only become more exacerbated over time. The value of Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange dropped by 98%; the rouble continues to plummet and has already lost 40% of its value. The central bank is desperately trying to prop up the rouble by imposing capital controls and doubling its interest rate to 20%. The Russian leadership now represents a pariah state. Individual financial sanctions are already in place and travel bans are in the making. Putin’s foreign assets, along with those of foreign minister Sergei Lavrov , defence minister Sergei Shoigu and members of the Russian security council have been frozen. The EU has sanctioned all 351 members of the parliament who voted to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk. More than a dozen billionaire oligarchs with ties to Putin are subject to asset freezes and travel bans. The UK’s list, however, is shamefully small – only three such individuals are included. But the UK government is working on new legislation that would allow it to act upon oligarch “hitlists”. In the private sector, the tide is changing too: multinationals are treating Russia as a toxic market. Major energy, tech, consumer goods, car and plane manufacturers are pulling out of Russia. A global campaign to boycott Russian goods is under way to pressure all companies to stop cooperation with the aggressor state. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund declared its $3bn investments in Russia worthless overnight. This is just a harbinger of what is to come for private and pension funds holding Russian assets. All these efforts are heading in the right direction, but they should be intensified, as Putin intensifies his war of terror in Ukraine. One easy and swift step would be to cancel the one-month grace period for US initial sanctions. Let us not forget that Putin declared war on Ukraine and bombarded its sleeping cities. He decided to wage war to satisfy his neo-imperialist ambitions, his desire to stay in power and his intent to destroy what is left of the global world order. What is unfolding in Ukraine is something not seen in Europe since the second world war. Putin’s Blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv failed and the Ukrainian armed forces are successfully repelling the Russian army on the battlefield. The Kremlin is now laying siege to large cities such as Mariupol and Kharkiv and is razing to the ground smaller cities such as Irpin, Hostomel and Bucha. His soldiers kill civilians trying to flee. There is evidence of deliberate targeting of civilian buildings, including using cluster bombs, which are banned under the Geneva conventions. Russia violates ceasefires, and 200,000 women and children are unable to exit Mariupol via agreed humanitarian corridors. And the situation will only get worse in the coming weeks. So, yes, Putin must fail. But the west must find the courage to ensure that happens. If boots on the ground and no-fly zones are off the table, then the west’s response to this war must be economic warfare in the name of defending democracy and freedom. There are costs to be shared by all, but also benefits, if Ukraine shields the rest of Europe from the horrors of war too. With the support of the west, Ukraine could become an open democratic society again – a keystone of European security right next to Russia. Because by ensuring that Putin fails, we ensure that Putinism at large fails too, and with it the idea that brutal military force can be used to restore a former imperial possession.
