4/26/2022,"New evidence of the extent of the privatisation of mental healthcare in England is extremely concerning. Ministers and health bosses must explain why the independent sector is earning almost £2bn a year for treating patients with psychiatric conditions – or 13.5% of NHS England’s entire mental health budget. Overall, about 7% of spending is on private providers, although this rose during the pandemic. It is difficult to think of a good reason why the proportion of mentally unwell people treated by private providers should be so much higher than the proportion of those with other conditions. If patient safety and care quality were the only considerations, extremely vulnerable mental health patients would seem to be among the least suitable candidates for outsourcing. After all, the general rule is that while standardised treatments such as cataract operations can be delivered via the independent sector relatively straightforwardly, more complex and long-term work is kept in-house. Why inpatient psychiatric care for under-18s should defy this rule, with 55% of all NHS-funded treatment delivered privately, is a troubling question for anyone who cares about the future of healthcare. The short answer, of course, is that the NHS does not have the resources or the staff to do this work itself. This leaves doctors and managers with no choice, as one psychiatrist described at the weekend. Years of underinvestment in the health service have hit the mental health sector hard. Currently, there are 10,123 private mental health beds in England (the NHS has 17,610) and private mental health providers earn 91% of their income from the NHS. But psychiatrists, the Care Quality Commission and NHS England’s national mental health director, Claire Murdoch, have all raised concerns about the quality of the care on offer. In 2019, the Priory group was fined £300,000 over failings that led to the death of a 14-year-old girl, Amy El-Keria. Last week, an inquest jury found that neglect contributed to the death of Matthew Caseby in another Priory facility. But there needs to be a longer answer too – one that addresses the underlying question of why, with average profit margins of 15%-20%, it has been made so easy to make money out of acute psychological distress. Also, whether the health and care bill that is on its way through parliament will lead to improvements or to further fragmentation, as the British Medical Association has warned that it could. Comparisons of the patient safety records of public and private providers are made difficult by a lack of data. Recent evidence has revealed grave failings in NHS hospitals too. But one doesn’t have to pretend that all is well in the public sector to reject as shameful the situation whereby businesses are enabled to make huge profits from delivering substandard care with weak oversight and minimal accountability. Patients and their families deserve better.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on mental health privatisation: unsafe spaces | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/25/the-guardian-view-on-mental-health-privatisation-unsafe-spaces
4/26/2022,"The UK’s top civil servant has privately warned Boris Johnson against forcing government workers back to the office amid growing anger in Whitehall over “scare tactics”, the Guardian has learned. Alongside Simon Case, at least four permanent secretaries – the most senior civil servants in their department – are also understood to have raised alarm over government rhetoric designed to reverse the shift to working-from-home arrangements during the Covid pandemic. Spot checks on office working by Jacob Rees-Mogg, including “sorry you were out when I visited” notes left on empty Whitehall desks, have seen the Cabinet Office minister branded “the milk monitor” by disgruntled officials. Case told the prime minister over the weekend that Rees-Mogg’s strategy was unwise and that the language against civil servants was going too far. A No 10 source said Case was fully on board with a return to more face-to-face working. On Monday No 10 backed Rees-Mogg’s approach amid a rift with Nadine Dorries over the office working drive, which the culture secretary had labelled “Dickensian”. Rees-Mogg had written to cabinet ministers urging them to coerce staff into a “rapid return to the office” and has been leaving notes for absent civil services with the message: “I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.” Among the rooms where he left calling cards was the national security secretariat in the Cabinet Office, causing particular disquiet in Whitehall because staff were under intense pressure in that unit, where they work on sensitive material. A government source said Rees-Mogg often had to move through other departments to get to his office at 100 Parliament Street, adding: “He is wholly focused on parts of the government under his control, not other ministers’ areas.” The minister, who is responsible for government efficiencies, presented figures to cabinet last week showing that some government departments were using 25% of office capacity in early April. Dorries’ Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) was at 43%. Rees-Mogg is understood to have done walkabouts at several government offices, including DCMS. During a visit to the Treasury, the Guardian was told he commented to one official that “you’re the first person I’ve seen working on this floor today”. He also visited the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and was unimpressed with the amount of empty desks so sent senior its officials a letter asking when they were going to shut the office given its apparent lack of use, sources said. But the Guardian understands the “threat” not to renew the lease has been abandoned. It was derided as a “scare tactic” to force teams across the government estate to justify using their space. A government source said: “The SFO have had a short-term reprieve and had their long-term requests for renewal denied by two separate ministers.” Several permanent secretaries have also privately voiced frustrations at Rees-Mogg’s “stunt”. An official working at one of Whitehall’s biggest departments said their director of communications had advised: “ignore him”. Another Whitehall source said civil service managers had promoted flexible working, with the expectation of spending one to two days a week in the office. On the civil service jobs site on Monday, more than 1,600 jobs were advertised as having flexible working arrangements. The disquiet at Rees-Mogg’s strategy also extends to ministers. One said: “I’m on team Nadine [Dorries] on this one. Who dreams this crap up? If the civil service aren’t working properly, reform them. Don’t wander round placing the physical equivalent of eye rolls on their desks.” Another Whitehall official said the push was creating a sense of injustice and warned that, coupled with a pay freeze, it would affect staff retention leading to “the worst brain drain I have ever seen”, with talented younger staff seeking to leave. They also pointed to the treatment of junior staff in No 10 and the Cabinet Office over the Partygate scandal, where civil servants have received or expect to receive fines for attending events with the prime minister or senior bosses. Dave Penman, general secretary of the civil service union FDA, said: “I am getting lots from members saying they have had enough and they are going to go. They are not going to be treated like this. “Ultimately civil servants will put up with what’s going on with cost of living and a significantly below inflation pay rise – but not this. It is so demoralising for civil servants because it’s not actually based on anything to do with their work and the best way to deliver public services.” A government spokesman said: “There is total agreement across government on there being clear benefits from face-to-face, collaborative working and we know that this is particularly important for the learning and development of new and junior members of staff. The minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency has written to departments to underline the importance of workplace attendance and request that they review their existing guidance on the minimum number of days staff work in the office.” Asked if Johnson backed Rees-Mogg’s policy of leaving calling cards at vacant desks, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “What the minister is seeking to achieve is to do everything possible to get the civil service to return to the pre-pandemic level ... That is supported by the cabinet secretary and obviously the prime minister.” Referring to the notes left on desks, Johnson “supports any initiative that encourages people to return to pre-pandemic working”, the spokesperson said. “We are not talking about putting an end to flexible working, which continues to have a place in the modern workplace, we are talking about returning to pre-pandemic use of taxpayer-funded departmental buildings.”",News/Politics,Civil service head warns PM against forcing Whitehall workers back to office,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/civil-service-head-warns-pm-against-forcing-whitehall-workers-back-to-office
4/26/2022,"The UK national security adviser, Sir Stephen Lovegrove, has said he did not consult Downing Street before telling the Foreign Office it should allow staff from an animal charity to be listed for evacuation from Afghanistan, but said he has “a far from perfect memory” of precisely what happened. The foreign affairs select committee is investigating leaked emails from Foreign Office staff that say Lovegrove directed that the Nowzad staff be evacuated after consulting No 10 last August. Downing Street had previously insisted Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie, did not intervene on behalf of their friend Pen Farthing, the charity’s founder, to airlift dogs out of Kabul while people died. The decision caused huge media controversy at the time, but Johnson said it was nonsense to suggest he intervened. Lovegrove told the committee on Monday that the Foreign Office leaked email was based on a plausible but incorrect assumption that he had consulted No 10. He said he acted after the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, tweeted at 1.15am on 25 August saying: “Now that Pen Farthing’s Nowzad staff have been cleared to come forward, I have authorised MoD to facilitate their processing.” Lovegrove said the issue was raised at a meeting at 10am that day and he checked with his national security secretariat whether the Nowzad staff were eligible by being on the “leave outside the rules” list, comprising deserving cases that did not meet other criteria. He told the committee he could not precisely remember with whom he checked “in a very complex and fraught environment”, but said he would have remembered if he had checked with either the prime minister or the defence secretary. Lovegrove said he did not know why Wallace posted the tweet, but he said it must have been due to a decision being relayed to him by Permanent Joint Headquarters, the military command. Wallace himself has said he received no instruction from No 10. Lovegrove said one of three cabinet ministers would have approved Nowzad staff being included on the “leave outside the rules” list on 21 August. Emails released by the foreign affairs committee cited an official in the office of Zac Goldsmith, a Foreign Office minister and close friend of Carrie Johnson, telling an official in his department that “the PM has just authorised their staff and animals to be evacuated”. That official later sent another message to other civil servants saying: “Having regard to the Prime Minister’s Nowzad decision, the Foreign Secretary might consider the [details redacted] vets and their dependents should be included. They might be able to get to the airport with their dependents in time.”",News/Politics,Security chief denies consulting No 10 over Afghanistan charity evacuation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/security-chief-denies-consulting-no-10-over-afghanistan-charity-evacuation
4/26/2022,"A senior barrister who repeated discredited police allegations about the behaviour of Liverpool supporters at the Hillsborough disaster has been cleared of misconduct by his profession’s Bar Standards Board (BSB). Jonathan Goldberg QC made his remarks last May in a BBC interview after the collapse of the final Hillsborough-related criminal trial, claiming that late-arriving Liverpool supporters had caused “a riot” at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, and crushed “innocents” who had arrived early. Goldberg also made a speech outside the court, where he had represented Peter Metcalf, the then South Yorkshire police solicitor, who was acquitted of perverting the course of justice for advising that dozens of police officers’ written accounts should be amended. Goldberg described the prosecution of Metcalf and two former South Yorkshire police officers as “a witch-hunt”, and said the money spent on criminal investigations into the disaster and its aftermath “would have been better spent on building new hospitals or schools, perhaps in Liverpool”. Many relatives of the 97 men, women and children killed at Hillsborough, and the mayors of Liverpool city region and Greater Manchester, Steve Rotheram and Andy Burnham, complained to the BSB about Goldberg’s remarks. The evidence of South Yorkshire police officers, accusing Liverpool supporters of drunkenness and blaming them for the disaster, has been repeatedly rejected: by Lord Justice Taylor in his 1989 public inquiry; by the Hillsborough Independent Panel in 2012; by three senior judges, including the lord chief justice, when they quashed the first inquest in 2012; and by the jury at the 2014-16 inquest. The BSB decided, however, that Goldberg had not breached the professional standards expected of barristers, and said it remained “reasonable”, protected as a matter of free speech, for somebody “in good faith” to repeat the original police allegations. Bereaved families, survivors and supporters fought through three decades to disprove the police allegations, and against the 1991 first inquest verdict of accidental death. The new inquest jury determined in 2016 that the then 96 victims were all unlawfully killed due to gross negligence manslaughter by David Duckenfield, the South Yorkshire police officer in command at Hillsborough. Having heard the police allegations against the supporters extensively, the jury fully rejected them, and determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. Duckenfield was acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter in 2019, after a trial at which his barrister again highlighted allegations of misbehaviour against supporters. Goldberg said in his BBC interview that Liverpool fans’ behaviour was “perfectly appalling on the day, causing a riot”, and that those people, let in by police through an exit gate at 2:52pm, “crushed to death … complete innocents, who were at the front of the [terrace] pens, who had arrived early and were not drunk and were behaving perfectly well”. Although some police officers originally propounded that narrative, that the people who died were all in the ground early, the 2016 inquest found by tracking their movements that 30 of the 96 had themselves come through the exit gate at 2:52pm. However, in its decision clearing Goldberg, the BSB said it was “reasonable” for him to repeat the police case, even though there remains “significant controversy” about it, and that the right of free speech allows somebody to criticise legal findings. “The [BSB] panel were of the view that it cannot be said, especially in light of the contemporaneous police accounts, that no reasonable person in the position of Mr Goldberg can in good faith have formed the view that he expressed.” Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, died at Hillsborough, said families and survivors had fought for 30 years and “the truth has been proved”. “But it’s no surprise that they cleared him because as we’ve found, the establishment protects its own,” she said. Goldberg declined to retract his remarks or apologise after the uproar last year, instead issuing a “clarification”, saying he had not intended to express those views as his own, and was not endorsing the police case. The BSB said that they did not make any finding on that, because they had decided that Goldberg was entitled to express that view anyway.",Sport/Football,Bar Standards Board clears barrister over Hillsborough remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/bar-standards-board-clears-barrister-over-hillsborough-remarks
4/26/2022,"The main private mental health hospital chains that treat NHS patients have been criticised by coroners and inquest juries dozens of times over the last decade for providing unsafe care. The Priory, Cygnet and Elysium have been censured at least 37 times for mistakes and lapses in care that were involved in the death of a patient, including several children. After hearing evidence in court coroners or inquest juries have identified serious failings in the care given to 23 patients who died while being treated at a Priory hospital since 2012, 11 who were in a Cygnet facility and three who were residents in an Elysium unit. They have found the same mistakes happening again and again at private units. Key failings included staff not observing potentially suicidal patients properly, ignoring relatives’ concerns about the danger of suicide that their loved one posed and wrongly assessing that risk. The Guardian disclosed on Sunday that the three firms earn more than half of the £2bn a year that the NHS in England now spends outsourcing mental health care because it has too few beds. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which monitors the death of people while a mental health inpatient, said: “The same basic failings are leading to preventable deaths of men, women and children. Persistent issues including with risk assessments, observations, ligature points and communication amongst staff or with families are costing lives. “For years inspections, inquests and investigations have repeatedly exposed neglect and harmful practices. Yet the NHS continues to commission these providers, at significant public expense.” In some cases the coroner has been so concerned by the evidence they have heard that they have issued a prevention of future deaths (PFD) notice – a legal warning to a public or private entity to make urgent changes to reduce the risk of someone else dying in the same circumstances. On Monday Louise Hunt, the senior coroner for Birmingham, issued a PFD ordering the Priory to make a series of changes following the death in September 2020 of 23-year-old Matthew Caseby, who died after absconding over a fence at the back of its hospital in Birmingham. The Priory had taken no action despite a previous absconsion over the same fence in October 2019. Hunt also advised the Department of Health and Social Care to bring in national guidelines for the height of perimeter fences and security in the outside areas of acute mental health units. Last month an inquest jury found that 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney had died in April 2021 “as a result of insufficient care, crucially inadequate observations and the delays in emergency response” at the Cygnet hospital in Sheffield. Last November, at the inquest into the death in 2019 of 16-year-old Nadia Shah at the Potters Bar Clinic in Hertfordshire run by Elysium, the jury found it was due to “misadventure contributed to by the inadequate care at the Potters Bar Clinic”. They cited six specific flaws, including mistakes in observation and “a failure to adequately report observations to properly inform assessment of risk”. It is unknown how many times NHS mental health trusts have been criticised by coroners or juries over the same period. However, in 2019 the Care Quality Commission, the NHS watchdog, said there was a “disparity in performance” on safety between private and NHS mental health units. The Priory said that the figures for the 23 occasions on which it has been censured by a coroner or inquest were “misleading and presented without any context”. It added: “Priory, as the UK’s largest independent mental health provider, has safely and successfully treated tens of thousands of patients over the last 10 years, as a trusted partner to the NHS. Deaths are extremely rare.” A Cygnet spokesperson said: “Any incident in which a service user has died is heartbreaking for everyone involved. Care for people with mental health conditions is challenging and our staff work incredibly hard to ensure the safety and wellbeing of those in our care.” Cygnet learns lessons from every death to prevent further fatalities, they added. In a statement Elysium said: “Over the last six years, tragically a small number of deaths have occurred in our high acuity services and our thoughts remain with each affected family. On the occasions when inquests into these deaths have made important recommendations we have acted swiftly and decisively.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/26/2022,"Caroline Sharp believed that when her daughter Emma Pring was admitted for treatment at the private Cygnet hospital in Maidstone, it would be a turning point in her daughter’s life. “In some ways it was my naivety, but I really did think she was getting the best care,” Sharp says. During the inquest to establish how and why her daughter died while an inpatient at the hospital, and after hearing the evidence given by the staff, Sharp remembers thinking: “How on earth did I let my daughter go there?” Sharp says her daughter was fundamentally a “lovely, lively, cheeky little girl”. “She was just so lovely to everybody she met,” she says. “And even when she started having her own difficulties, she just had so many friends that she would put over and above herself. I mean, just by looking at her Facebook page, the number of tributes and the number of people who still send her messages now, just really shows how she would always put everybody else first, often to her own detriment.” The difficulties Pring experienced refers to the struggles she had with her mental health, which included depression, borderline personality disorder and PTSD which was triggered when she was raped twice at the age of 18. In April 2016, Pring’s mental health began to further decline and she began to receive care from Sussex partnership NHS trust, left her job as a nursery nurse, and was eventually detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act. In July 2020, Pring was transferred, by the NHS trust, to the Roseacre ward at Cygnet in Maidstone, for what was meant to be long-term, specialist treatment. As a patient at the hospital, Pring received a type of trauma therapy which involved reliving what happened to her at 18, a therapy which Sharp said her daughter was “terrified” of beginning. In February 2021, although communication to her daughter was limited, Sharp says that a few days before her daughter’s death she told her mother that she wanted her to bring her home. “I said, Ems, you’re under a section 3, I’m not allowed. I can’t just do that.” Pring killed herself on 20 April 2021, aged 29. An inquest into her death, which concluded last month, found it could have been prevented by the hospital, with the jury finding there had been an “insufficient level of observation, and a misjudgment of Emma’s actual risk”. Rather than being placed on one-to-one observations that might have prevented her death, Pring was supposed to have been observed by staff every 15 minutes, a timeframe which the inquest found was not always adhered to. Cygnet’s own “root cause analysis” report found that if Pring had been placed on one-to-one observations it is likely that she would not have died. The coroner is also considering whether to issue a prevention of future deaths notice to Cygnet hospitals. Her daughter’s death has also led Sharp to question why her NHS trust was unable to provide care for mental health patients themselves, rather than contracting beds at private hospitals. “Why aren’t the NHS able to [provide this care] themselves?,” Sharp asks. “Why are there no placements on the NHS? Why are we relying so heavily on private healthcare to provide something like this?’” There have been at least 20 deaths of patients, aside from Pring, at Cygnet hospitals across the UK since 2011. Inquest, which has been tracking these deaths, believes they are concerning. Following the death of 17-year-old Chelsea Blue Mooney at a Cygnet hospital in Sheffield in April 2021, the same month that Pring died, an inquest found that “insufficient care” at the hospital had led to her death. For Sharp, hearing the jury’s conclusion at the inquest, that her daughter’s death could have been prevented and that there were failures at Cygnet hospital was “difficult to process”. “It’s just, really really difficult to come to terms with, and to know, that your daughter was failed by the people that should have been looking after her,” Sharp says. A Cygnet spokesperson said: “We would like to express our deepest condolences to Emma’s family and friends. Our thoughts remain with them. “We take the safety and wellbeing of our service users extremely seriously, and the recommendations from our review have been shared locally and across the organisation to ensure lessons learnt are identified and shared.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/26/2022,"The Texas Republican spearheading an extraordinary bipartisan effort to delay Wednesday’s execution of a Mexican American woman amid mounting evidence of her innocence has described the case as “the most troubling I’ve ever seen, possibly the most troubling in the history of our state”. In an interview with the Guardian, Jeff Leach, a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, said that even strong supporters of the death penalty – as he once considered himself – had great concern about the rapidly approaching execution. Melissa Lucio, 52, is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection for killing her two-year-old daughter Mariah, but new scientific evidence suggests the toddler died accidentally after a fall. Leach said that a possibly innocent woman was “about to be – let’s not mince words – murdered by the state”. He said that the numerous missteps made in the prosecution of Lucio had given him “great pause” that was forcing him to reconsider his support of capital punishment. “I’m not ashamed to say I believed in the death penalty for the most heinous cases. But this case is shaking my confidence in the system. It has failed Melissa and the victim of the tragedy, Mariah, at every turn,” he said. The lawmaker had strong words to say about the agonizing wait Lucio is enduring in her final hours before her scheduled execution. “It’s barbaric,” Leach said. “There’s no reason for it. They’ve had all the information they need for weeks – someone just has to step up and make the right decision.” The Republican lawmaker ran through a litany of prosecution failures. He said: “If it was just the interrogation, or just one piece of new scientific evidence, or only one juror and not five who have now said they regret their decision, then we could talk. But when you have all of these things where the system has failed, then that causes great alarm.” Leach’s comments came as Lucio’s battle to save her own life entered its final feverish hours. Her lawyers are fighting on several fronts in the hope of securing a stay of execution. On Monday, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles is meeting to discuss the Lucio case, and its recommendation will then be passed to the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, for his final say. Abbott has the power to put a hold on the execution, grant Lucio clemency or let the process proceed to the death chamber. Legal appeals have also been lodged with a local district court in Cameron county and in the Texas court of criminal appeals in Austin. A new filing on Monday reprised the many inconsistencies in the prosecution case, including evidence that Lucio’s confession was forced and that Mariah died as a result of injuries sustained when she fell down a steep flight of stairs and not at her mother’s hands. Leach has been at the forefront of efforts by Texas lawmakers to persuade the authorities to postpone the execution. He orchestrated a letter to the board of pardons signed by 80 House members, 32 of whom are Republican. A similar letter has been sent by 20 Texas senators, eight Republican. In the House letter, the lawmakers pointed out that Lucio was treated by prosecutors in a completely different way from her husband, who was also responsible for Mariah’s care. Lucio had no previous history of violence and her children said she had never been abusive towards them; by contract her husband had a history of assault yet is now a free man having only served a four-year sentence for child endangerment. The exceptional degree of bipartisan agreement, with more than half the legislature backing calls for a stay, is extremely rare in such a riven state. Leach, however, said he was unsurprised. “I know our country is pretty divided, and we have our fights,” he said. “But when something is as clear as this, I know my legislative colleagues on both sides of the aisle are willing to do the right thing.” Leach was one of several Texas lawmakers who visited Lucio earlier this month in the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville where the women’s death row is housed. He told the Guardian that they prayed together and he held her hand. “Her faith is incredibly strong. She is comforted by the prayers of millions across the world, so it was an amazing moment.” At the encounter, Lucio invited Leach to attend her execution on Wednesday should it go ahead. “If it does go forward, I will be there,” he said. “But I’m hoping that’s a trip I don’t have to make.”",News/US news,Texas Republican urges halt to ‘most troubling’ Melissa Lucio execution,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/melissa-lucio-execution-jeff-leach-opposition-republican
4/26/2022,"The UK government has defended a decision to pay millions of pounds in bonuses to staff at the collapsed energy supplier Bulb, despite the fact that it has been effectively nationalised as part of a bailout that could cost taxpayers £2.2bn. Quarterly “retention bonuses” were deemed necessary to prevent an exodus of staff that could have scuppered efforts to keep the business afloat while a buyer is found, multiple sources familiar with the situation said. “The alternative is that hundreds of people leave and you won’t be able to sell it,” one Whitehall source said. “You can’t provide energy to people if there’s nobody working at the company.” Bulb Energy, which has more than 1.5 million customers, is currently run by the consultancy Teneo, appointed under the “special administration” scheme after the energy supplier became the largest of more than 20 to collapse under the weight of sky-high energy prices. The arrangement is the first test for a system designed to kick in when an energy supplier is too big for its customers to be transferred immediately to a rival. Under the arrangement, a court appointed Teneo to run the day-to-day operations on behalf of the government, which is funding the costs. The financial advisory firm Interpath has been drafted in to run Bulb’s parent company, Simple Energy. The decision to pay quarterly bonuses, first reported by the Financial Times, is understood to rest with Interpath because payroll is managed through Simple Energy. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “Bulb’s administrators have set up an employee retention scheme in order to maintain operational effectiveness and support to customers. “The special administrator of Bulb remains legally obligated to keep costs of the administration process as low as possible – which the employee retention scheme is consistent with. “The government will seek to recoup costs at a later date, ensuring that we get maximum value for money for taxpayers.” The cost of running Bulb could reach £2.2bn, the Office for Budget Responsibility has said, while some reports have suggested £3bn is not unrealistic. A government source insisted that costs had not yet reached the £1.7bn initially set aside. The cost includes a heavily criticised £250,000 salary for Bulb’s boss and co-founder Hayden Wood, who has apologised for the company’s demise. A spokesperson for Interpath said: “The teams at Simple and Bulb have worked incredibly hard since the companies entered insolvency last November, ensuring the businesses have been able to continue to trade, and providing continuity of service for 1.5 million customers, and all against the backdrop of personal uncertainty that any administration inevitably causes.” The British Gas owner, Centrica, and the Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy firm Masdar are understood to be the frontrunners to buy Bulb Energy, with the government hoping that the investment bank Lazard can find a buyer by June. A further four parties have expressed interest, according to a Whitehall source, and could be called upon if Centrica and Masdar drop out.",News/Business,UK government defends bonuses paid to staff of collapsed firm Bulb,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/uk-government-defends-bonuses-paid-to-staff-of-collapsed-firm-bulb-energy
4/26/2022,"A Turkish court has sentenced a leading philanthropist to life imprisonment after finding him guilty of “attempting to overthrow the government by force” in connection with the Gezi Park anti-government protests in 2013. Osman Kavala, 64, has been held since October 2017 on accusations of financing the protests which began as small demonstrations in an Istanbul park and snowballed into nationwide anti-government unrest. The court also handed out 18-year sentences to seven activists accused of assisting Kavala, ordering the immediate arrest of Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Hakan Altınay, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Yiğit Ali Ekmekçi and Tayfun Kahraman. The courtroom, packed and overheated with fearful and exhausted observers, reportedly erupted with protest chants including “long live freedom, down with tyranny” on hearing the verdict. “We will not bow to persecution,” yelled Atalay on hearing his sentence. The sentencing marks Turkish authorities’ deepest and most public crackdown on dissent and freedom of assembly in the past decade and threatens to damage Turkish relations with Europe after heavy criticism of the marathon trial. Amnesty International called the decision “a travesty of justice”, calling the trial “a politically motivated charade”. “It’s a horrifying decision, and not one that was in any way expected,” said Emma Sinclair-Webb, Turkey director of Human Rights Watch, speaking from outside the courtroom. “This entire process from start to finish has been a show trial.” The draconian sentences, which defendants and observers claim was based on flimsy evidence, follow criticisms that the trial has been subject to political interference. “It’s completely in defiance of Turkey’s obligations to international law,” said Webb. “This case is emblematic, it’s exposed the human rights in the country as being in complete crisis – it shows that the presidency can do what it wants to people. It’s an act of utter defiance against the international order as well.” Kavala appeared in court via video link from Silivri high security prison on the outskirts of Istanbul. “I consider peaceful protests aiming to prevent government initiatives that are not in public interest as legitimate civil society activities and a requirement of democracy,” he said. “After losing four and a half years of my life, the only aspect I can find solace in is the possibility that what I experienced could contribute to confronting the crucial problems in the judiciary of Turkey, and so those tried in future could receive better treatment.” Small protests against an urban development plan in Istanbul’s Gezi Park that began in 2013 quickly transformed into huge anti-government protests. A fierce response by the authorities was followed by years-long attacks on anyone accused of aiding or organising the protest movement. Kavala was accused of financing the protests after he paid for a folding table and some snacks for protesters, and arrested in the Istanbul airport in 2017. He was later acquitted of all charges in 2020, but quickly rearrested before he could return home. He was later charged with espionage, and alleged involvement in a 2016 attempted coup. Kavala has frequently been singled out for criticism by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who accuses the Paris-born philanthropist of connections to the Hungarian-American investor George Soros. Last October, Turkey declared 10 western ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, “persona non grata”, after they issued a statement condemning Kavala’s continued detention, before later reversing the decision. The trial was repeatedly condemned as unjust and politically motivated by rights groups as well as the Council of Europe, whose ministers took the highly unusual decision earlier this year to formally begin the process of accusing Turkey of infringement, after Turkish authorities refused to release Kavala after a ruling by the European court of human rights. “It is regrettable that the Turkish authorities have refused to execute the respective ECHR’s ruling. Such attitude sets a worrying precedent and further increases the EU’s concerns regarding Turkish judiciary’s adherence to international and European standards,” they said. Kavala, Yapıcı and their co-defendants remained defiant in court throughout the sentencing, and are expected to appeal. “It is evident that those who issued the indictment did not feel constrained by laws, considering that they will receive political support as they intended to prolong my detention at all costs,” said Kavala.",News/World news,Philanthropist sentenced to life in Turkey in ‘travesty’ trial over Gezi Park protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/philanthropist-sentenced-to-life-in-turkey-in-travesty-trial-over-gezi-park-protests
4/26/2022,"The UK has supplied £200m of military aid to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said, as he confirmed Britain would send a “small number” of Stormer missile launchers to Ukraine and offer a deployment of Challenger 2 tanks to Poland. In a statement to MPs, Ben Wallace said gifts of weapons by Britain could eventually total £500m, and he said 15,000 Russian soldiers had died since the invasion began on 24 February. “We have gifted in aid £200m which we propose will grow to £500m to Ukraine,” Wallace told the House of Commons. Replacement equipment would be paid for by the Treasury on an “old for new” basis, the minister said. The objective of British military support should be to help ensure Ukraine “gets to chose where it wishes to settle for peace”, Wallace said, but he added that in his view Russia should be forced out of the entire country, back to its pre-2014 border. “I want Putin not only beyond the pre-February boundaries. He invaded Crimea illegally, he invaded Donetsk illegally and he should comply with international law and in the long run leave Ukraine,” Wallace said. Britain is one of the largest suppliers in Europe of arms to Ukraine, running down its stocks of weapons to keep Kyiv’s forces supplied. But its supplies are dwarfed by those of the US, which has provided $3.7bn of military aid since Russia invaded. Stormer armoured vehicles carry Starstreak laser-guided anti-aircraft missiles and are designed to provide a roving threat to Russian jets and helicopters. On the tanks, Wallace’s language suggested a firming up of plans first floated by Boris Johnson on Friday when he said the UK was “looking at” sending British Challenger 2s to Poland so that Warsaw could in turn send Ukraine more T-72 tanks, the Russian design used by its armed forces. Wallace told MPs: “We’re also offering a deployment of British Challenger tanks to Poland to bridge the gap between Poland donating tanks to Ukraine and their replacement arriving from a third country.” Poland expects to receive the first of 250 US-made Abrams tanks later this year but is willing to send more of its arsenal of T-72s to Ukraine if the UK and other western nations come forward and provide reinforcements now. Earlier this month it was suggested that Poland could donate 100 T-72s to its neighbour, and there have been some reports suggesting some of the Soviet-designed vehicles have already secretly been sent. Wallace indicated that the UK was looking at supplying Brimstone ground-based missiles that could be used to defend Odesa against any seaborne invasion, but he ruled out giving Kyiv the UK’s dated AS90 artillery. Since the beginning of the year the UK has supplied 5,361 NLAW anti-tank bazookas, more than 200 US-made Javelin missiles and 104 Starstreak high-velocity and other low-velocity anti-tank weapons, Wallace said.",News/Politics,"UK military aid to Ukraine could rise to £500m, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/uk-military-aid-to-ukraine-could-rise-to-500m-mps-told
4/26/2022,"Australian voters who chose their preferred candidate before the election was called have saved time. The campaign’s policy vacuum has hardly informed voting choices, with both major parties eschewing what the former US president George Bush Sr termed the “vision thing”. Whether or not politicians, irrespective of ideological colour, have the stomach for them, important and urgent economic challenges lie ahead. Household living standards are threatened by rising costs, low wage growth, poor quality of jobs, employment insecurity, higher mortgage repayments and housing unaffordability. Downgrades in 2022 global growth from 4.4% to 3.6% and China’s slowdown, along with its reduced emphasis on infrastructure spending, diversification of commodity suppliers and the antagonistic Sino-Australian relationship, pose risks to an uneven post-pandemic recovery. With China being the world’s factory, its Covid-19 policy may continue to disrupt supply for some time. Longer term, the pandemic and geopolitical realignments may reshape the global economic order. Australia, an open economy dependent on trade and the free flow of capital, is exposed. Rising costs of providing retirement incomes, aged care, and health and disability services will need to be met. With climate change accelerating, even modest restrictions on carbon emissions will impact Australia’s fossil fuel exports. Adaptation to regular extreme weather events and resource scarcity will be expensive. Increases in public and private debt have reduced flexibility to deal with these issues. Major changes in the economic structure are needed. This requires cogent policies for managing volatile commodity incomes, demographics, the labour market, workforce and skills planning, productivity, and regulatory and tax frameworks. Welfare systems need to be redesigned to ensure they assist the disadvantaged. Yet instead of addressing these issues, the 2022 election campaign has deployed familiar tropes. Both major parties have thrown fistfuls of dollars aimed at effectively buying votes. The cost-benefit analysis of many initiatives is dubious. While individually small, a few millions here and there soon add up to serious money. Both sides favour impressive announcements which they cannot or will not implement. During the pandemic and natural disasters, many government programs were difficult to access. Intentional complexity and a lack of resources allocated to processing applications means assistance frequently goes unused. Improvements in the federal budget result from money allocated for programs but not spent. The proclamation of a headline-grabbing scheme substitutes for taking the necessary action. Population growth to underpin economic activity and high property prices is popular with the two-thirds of the population who own real estate. This ignores resource constraints and limits on available land, which is protected from the effects of climate change. Initiatives, especially on defence, run into tens of billions. Voters are meant to be impressed by the sums, incomprehensible to most, even if the project’s merits are unclear. Credit is claimed for positives, irrespective of the claimant’s contribution. Australia’s recovery is driven by factors outside policymakers’ influence – for example, Chinese iron ore and coal demand, high commodity prices and supply disruptions elsewhere. The only direct input has been substantial government spending of other people’s money. Simultaneously, external factors such as the Ukraine conflict – outside Australian control – are blamed for negatives that include rising fuel, energy, food and housing costs. Numbers are manipulated to present favourable outcomes. Budget forecasts have repeatedly underestimated revenues, overestimated outgoings and understated commodity prices to make the actual outcome better and demonstrate competence. For hard issues, inquiries or royal commissions are proposed even though the problems and solutions are already known. If all else fails there is the the belief that something, probably new technology, will turn up, because it always has. Donald Horne’s phrase “the lucky country” is resurrected, ignoring its irony and criticism of a nation lacking imagination and mired in philistinism, provincialism, complacency and its past. While grist for comedians, this policy drift has consequences. Problems become larger and solutions more costly, or they have reduced effectiveness. Future generations are left to deal with the mess. The process encourages societal “cakeism”: keeping your confectionery and eating it. It promotes unrealistic expectations that there are no costs to choices and everyone can have everything when they desire it merely because they demand it. A “looting” mentality sets in. Voters auction their allegiances to the highest bidder under a “what’s-in-it-for-me?” ethos, ignoring the wider costs. Elections should be serious undertakings, when alternative plans and visions on important issues are presented and debated. The 2022 election campaign has, to date, fallen well short of this standard. This exacerbates a lack of voter engagement, a fragmented political process and, ultimately, a loss of trust in democracy itself.

4/26/2022,"Laurena Henschke had been dead about 12 months when a letter from the Australian government turned up at her Adelaide home. “Dear Mrs Henschke,” it read. “You have moved up in the queue and I expect that you will be assigned a home care package in about three months. This package may be lower than the level you are approved for, but it lets you start to receive some home care services.” The letter was a cruel frustration for her husband and carer, Dr Philip Henschke, who had sought, and been approved for, the highest level of home care for Laurena 18 months earlier. “Laurena had two years of relentless decline with what they call a glioblastoma multiforme, which is the A-grade nasty, can’t-beat-it brain tumour,” he told the Guardian. “Life got rough in the last six to nine months.” Henschke and his daughters worked together to care for her. But the demands became significantly more difficult in Laurena’s final stages. Laurena’s balance required two people, one on each side, to get her on to a shower chair or on and off the toilet. “You’ve got to have round the clock staffing, alarms, bed rails and all that sort of thing to cope. But we got by, we bought an electric bed and slept in the room with her, and we saw her into the next life, or off the planet, at home, which was a great blessing.” The letter felt like a parting shot from a system the aged care royal commission would later describe as “unacceptably” delayed. “What frustrated me was that having gone through probate, reporting her death through the state health authorities, cancelling her bank and superannuation accounts, it was quite clear that there was no intersection between them,” Henschke said. Four years have passed since his ordeal. But, with aged care firming as a key battleground before the election, has much changed in home care since? Has access to home care – critical in managing Australia’s ageing population and relieving the strain on residential care – improved since the royal commission last year told the government to act “urgently” to fix waiting lists? Data suggests the kinds of waits Laurena and Philip Henschke faced are still significant, though improving. After the royal commission, the Coalition announced 80,000 new home care packages worth more than $7bn, which are being delivered progressively until 2023. About 30,000 packages have been released so far. Government data shows the time people spend on the waiting list – the time between approval and the availability of care – is coming down gradually. The wait times for the kinds of packages Laurena Henschke was approved for has reduced to an average of six to nine months, down from 12 months or more in 2020. But at the same time the sector has warned of a glaring problem, compromising its ability to deliver support services, even if they have been approved and funded by government. It’s one faced right across aged care: staffing. Earlier this month, the biggest home care provider in the country, myHomecare Group, sounded the alarm, with its chief executive Stuart Miller telling the Guardian its staff were at “breaking point”. Miller estimated his staff turnover was somewhere near 30% in a single year – far better than the sector average, but still an extraordinary and disruptive rate. “The staff turnover in this industry has been nothing short of abysmal,” he said. “We’ve really found that a lot of the workers are leaving earlier certainly than they wanted and finishing their careers full stop just due to the stress of the last two years.” Staffing problems, he said, meant less critical forms of support were being delayed or compromised. “When you’ve got this level of turnover, it really upsets everything, from the clients to the economics of the business itself. It’s been a real struggle for us in the last two years.” Industry peak group, Aged and Community Services Australia, delivered a similar warning. It said the sector had faced “serious workforce shortages and low wages” prior to the pandemic. The pressures of the last two years had made it ever more difficult. “Attracting home care and other aged care workers has become even more difficult through the pressures of the past two years,” Acsa’s chief executive, Paul Sadler, said. It’s an issue that was flagged in no uncertain terms by the royal commission. In its final report last year, the royal commission said it was “not confident that there is adequate capacity to supply all the services that should be funded under a needs-based system”. “It will be necessary for supply-side capacity to be assessed and, where necessary, grown, so that aged care services are available when and where they are needed,” its report said. “This requires detailed planning.” The planning, the royal commission said, would need to ensure “an adequate coverage of services to meet the population needs for major cities, rural, regional, and remote Australia”, as well as ensuring “the capacity and capability of new and existing providers to deliver more aged care services”. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said last week that the home care workforce had grown by 15,000 in the past five months, which would constitute an almost 15% surge in the workforce. The figures – drawn from data only available to the minister, according to his office – are at odds with the experience of industry. Sean Rooney, chief executive of Leading Age Services Australia, an aged care sector peak group, said he had seen no figures reflecting such a significant boost to the home care workforce. “Providers report to LASA that they continue to face severe staffing challenges due to the pandemic, so it is difficult to see where these workers are coming from,” Rooney told the Guardian. Ahead of the this year’s budget, National Seniors Australia warned the government about precisely this point. The home care packages were welcome, the group said in its budget submission. But they were not enough without an adequate workforce to deliver them. It also provided several practical steps the government could take to unlock a new home care workforce, easily mobilised and often ready to work. Home care is typically provided through a combination of informal support, provided by family, and paid care workers. Yet the current pension arrangements effectively punish pensioners who want to take up caring work for family or loved ones. National Seniors said the “punitive, penny pinching pension system” punished people for working additional hours. It is advocating for exempting employment income from the age pension income test for low-wealth pensioners working in aged and health care. The group’s chief advocate, Ian Henschke, said the system was denying the sector a significant pool of workers for no good reason. “You’ve got people who work in aged care and home care who want to work more, who won’t work more because they get penalised 50 cents in the dollar,” Henschke said. “Why would anyone who is over 66.5 on a pension continue to work in aged care or home care? Yet they’re the very people who are often the most sympathetic to the older person, because they are about the age of the person’s daughter or son.” The government has provided $338.5m to expand, train and upskill the aged care workforce. The issue is personal for Henschke. Philip Henscke is his brother and Laurena was his sister-in-law. The number of people dying while waiting for their approved home care package has reduced in recent years. More than 50,000 older Australians have died since 2017-18. In the last six months of 2021, 3,802 people on the NPS died before receiving the home care package they had been approved for. More than 8,000 died in the 2020-21 financial year, and 10,563 died in 2019-20. Labor’s Mark Butler described the figures as a “national disgrace” and a sign the system was still in crisis, despite the reduction. “Most Australians want to age in their own home but the system that’s supposed to help them do that is in crisis,” he said. “There are still tens of thousands of older Australians waiting for Home Care Packages.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The opposition has sought to make aged care a central plank of its re-election pitch. But the policies it has announced so far largely focus on residential care. Colbeck says the opposition has “offered nothing on home care”. “While Labor has offered nothing on home care – the Morrison Government is investing in aged care workforce initiatives that attract and retain a diverse range of workers with the right skills, knowledge and attributes to work and pursue a career in aged care,” a spokesperson said. “Initiatives include place-based approaches targeting local workers and national projects.” For Philip Henschke, the idea of encouraging pensioners into home care work is a good one. He had a “fantastic” care worker who was a pensioner, but told him he would be unable to work more than one day a week. “[Fixing that] would be a great help to fill the gap because we’re not going to get there,” he said. “We haven’t got the nurses, and what we really do need are these home care attendants.”",News/Australia news,"Too little, too late: who will fix the home care crisis for Australia’s ageing population?

4/26/2022,"The Queensland police service appears to have balked at substantial reform to the way it handles officers who are accused of domestic violence, after promising to act on a “concerning increase” in the volume of complaints. Last May the assistant commissioner Brian Codd told Guardian Australia that police were “grappling” with how to respond to the increase officer-involved domestic violence, and that reforms were “very much” on the agenda. “You can be a truck driver and you can be subject to a domestic and family violence order and it may not have any impact on your employment or where you sit within society … but we expect and are entitled to more from police officers,” Codd said last year. He said at the time he had met with the Queensland police ethical standards command “to work out a position we might need to take on this”. Asked last week what progress had been made in Queensland, a police spokesperson pointed to changes to the operational procedures manual in July 2021 to “support greater officer accountability and ensure the confidence of the public is maintained while an investigation takes place”. A comparison with the previous operational procedures manual shows the relevant section was updated to require additional paperwork by officers, including ensuring that the “actioning district” submits a briefing note to police ethical standards command for consideration of disciplinary action. “Immediate consideration of the officer’s circumstances, current position, and the level of contact that member may have with members of the public is reviewed on a case-by-case basis,” the police spokesperson said. Officer-involved domestic violence poses a significant problem to authorities; specifically allowing natural justice to a person accused of an offence, or subject to a domestic violence order. At the same time, women’s advocates say it is problematic that a domestic violence victim seeking assistance could theoretically encounter an officer who is subject to a complaint, charge or conviction. Domestic violence now makes up about 40% of calls for police assistance. Victoria has attempted to address the issue by establishing a specialist police unit to investigate complaints against officers. Angela Lynch, a domestic violence protection advocate, said changes to operational procedures in Queensland did not go far enough, and victims needed “confidence their case will be dealt with appropriately”. Lynch said officer-involved domestic violence would be under-reported, and Queensland should have some mechanism where complaints against officers could be made and assessed independent of police. “The community needs confidence that police acknowledge that this is a problem, and that there’s some level of independent oversight,” she said. “There has to be some oversight of the decision-making process. I don’t think the community in the end does have confidence that police can do this themselves. It’s Caesar judging Caesar.” Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that 84 serving police officers had been accused of domestic violence in the previous five years. Police say this rate is “lower than the general public” but evidence suggests officers are “as likely as anyone else” to perpetrate domestic violence. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “On occasion QPS members are subject of domestic and family violence complaint reporting,” a police spokesperson said. “While these particular matters may be lower than the rate of the general public, any report of members suspected of perpetrating domestic and family violence is taken extremely seriously. “Responding to incidents of domestic and family violence is often challenging and complex. “The Queensland police service remains committed to refining and enhancing the police response to DFV, including improving processes for reporting and investigating matters in a timely manner, taking protective action tailored to the needs of the victim and holding perpetrators to account.”",News/Australia news,Queensland police update manual after signalling reforms to how officers accused of domestic violence are handled,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/queensland-police-update-procedures-after-promising-to-act-on-officers-accused-of-domestic-violence
4/26/2022,"I’m tempted to start this column by writing: a well-made garment can be elusive, but we all know it when we see it. Unfortunately, I think saying so is about as helpful as the advice, “you do you”. The reality is, the quality of our clothes has been in steady decline since the late 1990s, when fast fashion caused production and consumption to rise and prices to plummet. Despite this, well-made garments do exist, if you know what you’re looking for. Here, in the first of a two-part series, experts explain how to tell if a garment has been made with care and skill before you take it into the fitting room. The owner of vintage consignment store Shop Bruce, Dan Neilsenbeck, says: “The best way to assess the quality of a garment’s construction is to look inside.” When you do this, the first thing you should be checking is if the hem and seams are thoroughly sewn down. According to Max Sanderson, a lecturer in fashion design at Parson’s Paris, a loose hem is easy to snag with a thumb or big toe. Next, Sanderson says to examine the stitching. He looks for small stitches because they’re more durable than long ones which are a giveaway that a garment has been made quickly. Finally, he inspects the whole thing for flaws to be sure there are no threads coming undone or obvious signs it has been damaged or pulled. The tags inside the garment will tell you where the garment was made, what its fabric composition is and how to care for it – key things when deciding if something is going to suit your needs. For instance, if you are looking for something to wear on a day-to-day basis, you likely want to steer clear of garments labelled hand wash or dry clean only. Similarly, the fabric composition tells you how the garment will wear. Anything made of a protein fibre like wool will keep you warm when it’s cold but will also breathe if you get hot. It also has a waxy coating, so it doesn’t need to be washed frequently and is resistant to wrinkles, so it is good for travelling. Fibres made from plant matter like cotton, linen or viscose rayon are breathable but won’t keep you as warm. They are easy to wash making them great to wear close to the body, but crease easily. Synthetic fibres like polyester or nylon are trickier. They don’t breathe and trap body odour so if you are wearing them against your skin, you may notice they cause you to sweat and smell. But Sanderson says synthetics can be necessary for performance requirements like waterproof or windproof jackets and athletic wear. According to Neilsenbeck: “High quality fabric will feel better on your skin and generally fit, drape and wear better.” To judge the quality of a garment’s fabric, you need to get a sense of the fabric’s hand, or how it feels. To test this, designer Bianca Spender pulls the fabric between her thumbs to see if it stretches or holds its form then she will gently rub it to see if it pills. Sanderson recommends rubbing the fabric against a part of your body that’s more sensitive than the palm of your hand, like the side of your neck or forearm, where the skin is more delicate. While it may have been true 20 years ago that a made in Italy tag indicated a superior level of craftsmanship and quality, that’s not necessarily the case now. Knowledge and expertise vary widely across factories and within countries, and some of the most advanced technology and skilled workforces are in China and other parts of the global south. But there are some other things to consider based on where something is made, like environmental protections and labour laws. Spender says: “You should always be asking yourself the question does the price of the clothing reflect the work that goes into it.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning A more technical way of judging the care and attention that went into making something are the seams. Spender says she “will always check to see if the seams are bubbling and whether the side seam is hanging straight, to check the fabric isn’t off grain”. If a garment is made of a patterned fabric, Neilsenbeck says to make sure the patterns are matched along the seams. The finish of a seam on the inside of a garment can tell you a lot about the time and care that went into making it. A good rule of thumb is that there should be no raw edges. One way of covering raw edges is to overlock the seam. Overlocking is a type of stitch that goes right to the edge of the cloth and runs in tight, zigzag lines from the edge to about half a centimetre in. According to Sanderson, an overlocked seam is the fastest way to make a garment and can be more fragile. But in certain things like jersey T-shirts or jumpers, this isn’t necessarily a problem. “It’s all about the right finishes for the right materials,” Spender says. Generally speaking, better quality garments will have bound seams, so that the raw edge of the fabric is covered. Or flat-felled seams where there are no exposed edges, so the fabric has been folded twice and stitched along both sides. A French seam is similar to this but is less visible and usually used for high end, sheer garments.

4/26/2022,"Western screenwriting tradition says that conflict is the heart of all storytelling, but after a hard day you may not want to watch something stressful. Some people turn to “slow TV” – meditative footage of scenic train rides or people knitting that can go for 10-plus hours – but my preference is for what I’ll call “slow anime”, known in Japan as iyashikei or “healing-type” anime: stories that are designed to be as comfy and mellow as can be. Perhaps the best-known iyashikei anime outside Japan is Studio Ghibli’s 1988 film My Neighbour Totoro, a story in which nothing much happens until the last 20 minutes – despite the presence of soot spirits, a set of tanuki raccoons and a flying cat that is also a bus. Totoro contains many elements common to slow anime: an optimistic sense of wonder at the natural world, often explored through the prism of youth; some lush background art; and wonderfully tranquil music. Unlike other Ghibli films like Spirited Away or even the similarly chill (though more narratively focused) Kiki’s Delivery Service, Totoro revels in small joys: sharing time with family, cleaning a dusty old house together, or enjoying the fresh air while rambling through forests and fields. It all adds up to evoke the sort of feeling you might experience while doing those things yourself. It’s not that these slow anime shows and films don’t have plots, but the stories they tell tend to be simple and grounded, even if they contain fantastical elements. Episodes might be about picking apples, or going to the beach, or getting a (usually chill) part-time job, even visiting a cafe for (extremely chill) ghosts. If there’s any drama in them, it is equally mundane: someone forgot something, someone got a bit lost, it’s raining and you didn’t bring an umbrella. Despite such unexciting fare, these shows don’t feel boring so much as they do soothing. You might nod off to sleep, but it’s the sleep of someone who has had a hot chocolate under a warm weighted blanket. It’s simply nice. The genre does have its criticisms. The academic Paul Roquet traced the genre’s rise in Japan to the after-effects of the 1995 Kobe earthquake and sarin gas attacks on the Japanese underground , in an essay on the literary equivalent of iyashikei, which he calls “ambient literature”. Roquet argued that Japanese authors like Haruki Murukami and Banana Yoshimoto had created a genre that amounted to the avoidance of real problems, constituting “the ideological manipulation of those needs [healing and soothing] for commercial and political ends”. Soothing as they may be, iyashikei anime have launched merchandising empires selling anything from branded trinkets to straight-up camping gear, just like regular anime. But as Roquet also says, these criticisms apply more when the practice “slips from a form of temporary escape to a habit of perpetual withdrawal”. To my mind, iyashikei anime is like most other forms of media – if you don’t overindulge, you’ll be fine. Maybe you’ll even feel better for watching it. On that, here’s some of my best picks: Most Ghibli movies contain elements of iyashikei, but they’re often intermingled with a coming-of-age story, a romance or an adventure. Totoro is probably the purest in terms of just letting the wonders of the world wash over you. A group of high schoolers go camping in the mountains. That’s it. There’s two seasons so far and an upcoming movie I am absolutely dying to see later this year even though, inevitably, nothing much will happen. A witch moves in with her cousins in the Japanese countryside. Similar to Totoro, despite the presence of magic, most episodes are about pleasantly mundane tasks like following a cat around town or harvesting crops (screaming mandrakes, in this case). The first season of this comedy about a high school band was more traditionally structured, only in the second season does the show slow down and stop to smell the roses. The result is a joyful, somewhat nostalgic look at the everyday life of a handful of students as graduation approaches.",Arts/Culture,In praise of iyashikei: why we love soothing anime where nothing happens,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/26/in-praise-of-iyashikei-why-we-love-soothing-anime-where-nothing-happens

Waight said the state’s Indigenous communities have “seen far too much senseless loss of life in the Victorian justice system”. “Veronica should still be alive today and we hope to get some answers that help us understand why she is not and ensure it never happens again,” she said. An autopsy found Nelson suffered complications from Wilkie’s syndrome, a rare condition that is characterised by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She had been arrested three days earlier in the Melbourne CBD and denied bail after police discovered she was wanted for questioning over shoplifting. At a 2020 directions hearing, the Victorian coroner’s court heard Nelson had cried for help multiple times in the three hours before her death. During that time, prison and nursing staff did not check on Nelson physically, but communicated with her through an intercom system and a door flap, the court was told. A prison nurse gave Nelson Panadol after she reported leg camps and the anti-nausea drug Maxolon. The court also heard Nelson had been experiencing heroin withdrawals. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service will represent Nelson’s partner of 22 years, Percy Lovett, at the inquest. Lovett has previously described Nelson as a “strong woman” and someone who would always help others on the street, and said he wanted the inquest to ensure it was “easier for the next woman who get locked up”. Nelson’s mother, Donna Nelson, has remembered her daughter as a “warrior” with a “fighting spirit” who was deeply connected to her Aboriginal culture, and was like a “second mother” to her two brothers, Duane and Russell. Nelson had been arrested on Spencer Street in Melbourne on 30 December 2019, on theft charges and an outstanding warrant. She appeared in court later that day without legal representation and was refused bail, with a court hearing scheduled to take place two weeks later. She spent a night at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre’s medical unit before being moved to a transition area for new arrivals. After the Bourke Street killings in 2017, the Andrews government tightened Victoria’s bail laws. Under the reform – which has resulted in a significant increase in the state’s remand population and delays for court hearings – the person charged with an offence must prove they meet “exceptional circumstances” or have “compelling reasons” to be released on bail. Thalia Anthony, a senior law lecturer at the University of Technology Sydney, said the legislative changes had shifted the focus towards “an assumption against bail”. “Systemically, the bail legislation and decision making has always worked against Aboriginal people. But when you tighten those laws and make it harder to get bail, then it’s going to impact on Aboriginal people and Aboriginal women more harshly and that bears out in the statistics,” Anthony told Guardian Australia. “The bail system, even at its best, is discriminatory because it doesn’t account for factors that would systemically discriminate against Aboriginal people. For example, there’s a higher chance of getting bail if you’re employed and have secure housing, and don’t move around.” Last month, a wide-ranging inquiry into Victoria’s criminal justice system recommended the state review its bail laws, with the changes leading to a rise in the number of people on remand. Women are disproportionately affected. It found almost half of all women in prison were on remand – an increase from 22% in 2010. A larger proportion of women had been held on remand in recent years than men, with this figure even higher for Aboriginal women. The Sentencing Advisory Council found the imprisonment rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people almost doubled between 2010 and 2020, from 971.8 to 1,848 per 100,000 adults. The inquest will run until 27 May and will examine the circumstances and cause of Nelson’s death, including how she came to be in custody, the medical treatment she was provided and systemic issues in the state’s remand system.",News/Australia news,Inquest into Aboriginal woman’s death in custody to examine healthcare in Victoria’s prisons,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/inquest-into-aboriginal-womans-death-in-custody-to-examine-healthcare-in-victorias-prisons
4/26/2022,"A Coalition MP praised a now contentious trip to China featuring Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, as “an invaluable opportunity to have open and candid dialogue”. The Morrison government has attempted to discredit the opposition’s claim that the major parties are united on China policy by highlighting Marles’ trip to China in 2019 and his speech to a Beijing university. Marles said at the time it would be a “profound mistake” to define China as an enemy. But it has emerged that the Liberal National party backbencher Ted O’Brien – who joined Marles and Labor’s Tanya Plibersek on the three-day study tour organised by the China Matters thinktank – praised the 2019 trip. Marles travelled to Beijing early to deliver the speech, before joining the study tour the next day. “China Matters provided an invaluable opportunity to have open and candid dialogue with thought-leaders, specialists and practitioners of the PRC [People’s Republic of China] government, business sector and civil society,” O’Brien said in a testimonial. “For Australia to continue navigating its future amidst an uncertain global political economy, it’s vitally important that we deepen our understanding of China and they deepen their understanding of us,” he said. O’Brien’s praise of China Matters appears to contradict Liberal senator James Paterson, who told the Australian newspaper on Monday that the thinktank was “a controversial organisation which is sympathetic to the Chinese Communist party”. The thinktank strongly disputes the claim. The members of the study tour also included the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, Fiona Simson, and Rio Tinto government relations adviser Brian Pontifex. When asked on Monday night whether he retained the same view about the September 2019 study tour and China Matters, O’Brien told Guardian Australia: “My testimonial stands.” But O’Brien said navigating how best to deal with China was “the biggest challenge facing our nation” and he worried the Labor party “seems so clueless”. “You need look no further than the dangerous and ill-conceived views of Richard Marles to realise the need for a far deeper understanding of China, its underlying motivations and intentions,” O’Brien said. “The same goes for China’s need to better understand Australia, as the communist regime’s current strategy of bullying and coercion and refusing dialogue has failed because our positions are based on a set of principles and values that we’re prepared to strongly defend. “While there’s a place for parliamentary delegations, they’re not enough to develop a sophisticated understanding of the various complexities of a country like China, and Richard’s views on the regime make this apparent.” The day before the study tour began, Marles delivered a speech to the Beijing Foreign Studies University in which he said Australia must seek to build the relationship with China “not just in economic terms, but also through exploring political cooperation and even defence cooperation”. Marles, who was then Labor’s defence spokesperson, said talk of a new cold war was “silly and ignorant” and Australia did not have “an exclusive right to engage with the Pacific”. The basis of Australia’s interest in the Pacific “cannot be about attempting to engage in the strategic denial of others”. After a renewed focus on the September 2019 trip in recent days, Marles noted that he had also raised human rights concerns. Labor argues the government is seeking to distract from the signing of a security agreement between China and Solomon Islands on the Coalition’s watch. Marles admitted on Monday to an “administrative mistake” in failing to disclose the China Matters-funded portion of his trip to China on the register of members’ interests. Both O’Brien and Plibersek had already done so. The Australian reported on Monday that Marles had claimed $6,191 in taxpayer funds for the initial portion of the visit to China, prior to joining the China Matters-funded study tour. Marles said the travel was “in an official capacity in accordance with the parliamentary business resources framework”. “All travel for parliamentary business is reported quarterly by the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority,” Marles said in a statement. “On this occasion, an administrative error was made and part of my trip – paid for by China Matters – was not on my register of members’ interests as it should have been. I have sought to rectify this. “My trip to Beijing has not been a secret, and has been well covered in multiple newspapers, online coverage and several interviews.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Marles has confirmed an earlier report in the Australian that he had given a copy of the speech to the Chinese embassy in Canberra in advance – but said he had not made any changes after doing so. He said on Saturday he shared the speech because he had “criticised China” and “wanted to make sure that the Chinese government were not at all surprised”. In the 2019 speech, Marles said Australia would continue to “raise our concerns, as we have about the minority Uyghur population in Xinjiang, or the situation in Hong Kong”. “We do this on behalf of all Australians who believe people have a right to express their views through peaceful and lawful assembly,” Marles said on 23 September 2019. Marles told reporters on Saturday: “How many government ministers have gone to China, and in China publicly criticised the Chinese government?” The Coalition has been seeking to shine attention on Marles’ speech since February when Paterson uploaded it to his website and questioned why it was not on the Labor MP’s own site. Paterson told Sky News: “I would never, ever share a speech in advance of giving it with a foreign authoritarian government.” In parliament, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, labelled Marles a “Manchurian candidate” before withdrawing the claim amid pushback from current and former security officials. Last week the defence minister, Peter Dutton, said: “Richard Marles, of course, went to Beijing. I don’t know who paid for his trip. I don’t know who he visited there. I don’t know who he spoke to. I don’t know the relationships that he formed. I don’t know who he’s kept in contact with since that time. But he came back with some certain views and he’s expressed those.”",News/Australia news,Richard Marles’ contentious China trip was praised by Coalition MP,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/richard-marles-contentious-china-trip-was-praised-by-coalition-mp
4/26/2022,"When Scott Morrison visited Western Australia in March, he briefly fumbled a question from a reporter by saying he had met the state’s opposition leader, the Liberal David Honey. Morrison had to be reminded that the opposition leader is Mia Davies, a National, after the landslide 2021 election returned just two Liberals to the WA lower house. That result sent shockwaves through the Liberal party, and suggested WA could deliver a rich return for federal Labor: Swan (on a 3.2% margin), Pearce (5.2%) and Hasluck (5.9%) could fall with a swing just one-third as big as Mark McGowan’s. Since the Labor premier’s emphatic re-election, Morrison has told Western Australians they could have both McGowan and Morrison – refining the pitch to acknowledge that although he may not be universally popular, he is at least a known quantity. But many voters in Swan and Hasluck say Morrison lacks the consistency to make the case for “better the devil you know” over Anthony Albanese’s small-target approach. Andrew, an undecided voter in Swan who Guardian Australia meets on the South Perth foreshore, complains all parties have the “same agenda”. But he has “no confidence” in the prime minister, he says, and “Morrison and his personality” may be the best thing Labor has going for it. “When he’s questioned, all his answers are deflected on to something else, there is no definite yes or no … I’d rather someone say the wrong thing and have a point of view than just change the subject.” Nigel Harrison, who votes for Labor or the Greens, says Morrison “flip-flops continuously”. He says Western Australians were frustrated by the PM’s approach to the pandemic. “He just drove us nuts,” Harrison says. “All the Liberal states were worried about businesses not the people.” WA remained blissfully Covid-free for much of the pandemic, closed to the rest of Australia despite the Morrison government’s attempts to help Clive Palmer force the state open through a high court case – which it pulled out of in the face of overwhelming unpopularity. Many undecided voters either say Morrison got in the way of McGowan’s pandemic response, or, at best, took credit for it. But Harrison worries that if people are voting on personality, Albanese “may cost us the election” – he sees the Labor leader as “a bit of a wet leaf sometimes”. Swan is a perennial must-win seat for Labor in a state where it has historically underperformed. The retiring Liberal MP Steve Irons has held it since 2007. Directly across from the Perth CBD, it takes in most of the area between the Swan River and Canning River, including the airport and Curtin University. Voters lean Liberal at its fringes along the Swan River in the west and Hasluck in the east. When we visited in March, awareness of the local candidates in Swan was low as war in Ukraine, floods on the east coast and the first community spread of Covid after the WA border reopened crowded the news cycle. Eventually, Don Stephens, a Swan voter we find out-of-electorate by Cottesloe beach, ventures that the Labor candidate “is a female engineer, which seems positive”. Labor’s Zaneta Mascarenhas tells Guardian Australia she is excited that Swan’s next member will be a woman, but emphasises the electorate has “two very different candidates” to choose from. She notes that her opponent, Liberal Kristy McSweeney, comes from a “political dynasty” and has worked for a federal MP and as a news commentator. Mascarenhas on the other hand was “born and bred in the goldfields” to a metalworker dad and a cleaner mum. Her career, she says, started “in steel-capped boots”. Asked about improving representation in politics, she replies that though some are interested in her candidacy because she is a woman of colour, she is “most excited” about the diversity of skills she will bring to parliament, as an engineer from a science background. The pitch: identity politics for blue-collar blokes. Mascarenhas plays it skilfully – and more authentically than “ScoMo”, the welding jack of all trades and master of none caricature constructed by the PM. Mascarenhas says Morrison is “not a leader” and suggests his attempts to recover the Coalition’s position through scares about national security or the economy are “desperate” and will fall flat. “Australians can spot a fake.” Out doorknocking, Mascarenhas shows her talent in the field. She calibrates her tone: respectful towards Irons when speaking to an older gent, more critical when addressing a young mother who feels left behind by the Coalition government. Federal parliament “needs more people with real skills”, she tells Bernie Lawrence, the Irons voter. “It’s not so much what you’ve done or what you’ve learned,” he replies. “It’s what you can do for the people in this area.” Delivery will be his focus when casting a vote. Despite stints as a staffer over 16 years, McSweeney, who worked for Tony Abbott and Michaelia Cash, rejects the image of her as an insider when we meet near her South Perth office. She appears on Sky News “at night time”, she says. During the day, she spent seven years building her own business, a PR consultancy – “from a laundromat,” she says, “because I couldn’t afford wifi in my apartment that I was renting”. McSweeney paints her political experience as a virtue, arguing she won’t be “bamboozled” if she makes it to Canberra. Her election would make for the “very first conservative mother-daughter team in Australian politics”. (Her mother, Robyn McSweeney, started as a social worker and ended up as child protection minister.) At Belmont Forum Shopping Centre, it’s the federal issues deciding people’s votes. Most want a change of government, perhaps because the electorate is Labor at its core. Beth Runciman, a first-time voter, “doesn’t really agree with the Liberal policies”, which she sees as “more high economic status-based”. She associates Labor with greater equality: “I’m more for helping people who need the help.” John Eaton, a teacher who votes Greens, says “the most important thing is we get rid of Morrison and his cronies”. He cites “the need for a federal Icac”, support for disadvantage in times of crisis, and Morrison’s “inability to respond to crises”. Milan Simic, a rusted-on Labor voter, criticises Morrison for “getting too much in the political side against China, which is our number one trader”. Michelle Parker says after a few terms of the Coalition, Australia “needs true leadership in our prime minister, something that’s really been lacking”. “I want to see a federal Icac, more than anything,” she says. “I think we need to look into the rorts and things that have been happening.” Party operatives say if Labor can win Swan and Pearce (vacated by the retiring Liberal MP Christian Porter) then WA will have done its share for Albanese. But Hasluck, a sprawling outer-urban electorate stretching over Perth’s north-east, is also a target – the sort of seat that could turn a nail-biting election night and hung parliament into a workable majority. At Guildford train station, Sue Millard, a nurse and Labor voter, says Morrison “hasn’t done a very good job” on the pandemic. “We’ve been very lucky in WA to have Mark McGowan and the stance he’s taken.” She cites other concerns, too – “sexism, lack of concern with the fire that happened and he was on holiday”. It’s not just progressive voters unhappy with the federal pandemic response. While that cohort wishes Morrison had left the job to McGowan, reactionary right voters criticise the PM for not stepping in enough over the state’s sweeping vaccine mandates, which cover 75% of the workforce. At Ellenbrook Central shopping centre we meet Ken Taylor and his wife, Yvonne. Ken, who lost his fly-in-fly-out construction job due to a mandate, says Covid “has been managed very poorly from the government … in the sense that it’s not a pandemic”. “I certainly won’t be voting for the major parties,” he says. “There’d be no way I’d vote for them after this.” Ken says he’ll vote independent or for minor parties, and scrutinise preferences to “make sure they’re not going to Labor or the other larger parties”. “Scott Morrison could stop this … He could turn around and say these mandates aren’t right. “I don’t think Morrison will [win] and I think it would be a disappointment if Albanese gets in the seat – he probably will.” But while Morrison is poorly rated, the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, is a chance to hold Hasluck against a swing to Labor. Wyatt, the member since 2010, is well known in all parts of the electorate except Ellenbrook, an expanding outer-urban project home suburb redistributed into Hasluck from Pearce. Greg Waller, a former Labor voter in Midland, says he votes for Wyatt because he “does a good job”. “Really, it’s the local MP you can interact with and get issues corrected [by] that you’re worried about,” Waller says. “Scott Morrison’s not going to answer my phone call, but Ken will.” Waller is less impressed with Morrison, whose performance he says is “not real good”. “He puts his foot in his mouth sometimes,” he says, citing trade disputes that “wouldn’t have happened if he kept his cool”. Gretchen Walsh, a Liberal voter, says she is “quite happy” with Wyatt. She has “no confidence whatsoever” in Albanese however. “He only criticises everything, he doesn’t suggest, ‘we could do this or do that’,” she says. Walsh credits both Morrison and McGowan for their handling of the pandemic. “Because of these times and this Covid-19, anybody with any power has been doing the best they can.” It’s a common refrain from Liberal voters – who feel sorry for Morrison and say he has done well in the circumstances – but it’s often tinged with surprise that others have turned against the Coalition in what is usually a stronghold. We meet Wyatt outside the Ray Owens Sports Centre in Lesmurdie. It’s where the West Rise special needs basketball competition runs, of which Wyatt has been a patron since 2011. He argues the Coalition is better on both local and national levels, citing the economy and national security, including higher defence spending than under Labor and “deporting people who are significant offenders and dangerous to the community”. Asked about the PM’s line that Western Australians can have both McGowan and Morrison, Wyatt’s face falls before he makes the case the two have similarities. “The premier is popular because of the border closure and people have looked at that as a strength,” Wyatt says. “The prime minister is very pragmatic … We closed our international borders to travellers from the beginning. So we did have a border closure to protect us.” Labor’s Hasluck candidate, Tania Lawrence, says the election result will reflect that Western Australians hold Morrison “responsible for his failure to act on vaccines and on quarantine”. Lawrence says the electorate’s big issues are aged care, climate change – “given we live and breathe the risk of climate change with bushfires” – and mobile phone coverage, which is “patchy across the entire electorate”. Lawrence doesn’t have “any beef” with Wyatt, who she describes as “personable”. But she says the electorate has “expectations that the Liberal government should have delivered by now, and have failed to do so”. “Is that a reflection on Ken? That’s ultimately for the voters to decide.”",News/Australia news,Why not both?

4/26/2022,"Labor will vow to increase foreign aid to Pacific island countries and ramp up patrols to fight illegal fishing, as it makes an election pledge to “restore Australia’s place as first partner of choice for our Pacific family”. A boost to regional broadcasting is also part of the package, with Labor seeking to intensify political pressure on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, in the wake of China signing a security agreement with Solomon Islands. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Penny Wong, who will outline the Labor plan alongside senior frontbench colleagues on Tuesday, accused Morrison of dropping the ball in the Pacific. “The vacuum Scott Morrison has created is being filled by others who do not share our interests and values,” Wong said in a clear reference to China. Morrison said on Sunday that Australia shared the same “red line” as the US and that a Chinese military base in the south Pacific would be unacceptable, but did not spell out what Australia would do if this occurred. Labor’s seven-part plan is understood to include a substantial increase to Australia’s Official Development Assistance, but the party has not revealed the exact amounts ahead of Tuesday’s announcement. Labor has released details of three other parts of the plan, including doubling Australia’s $12m in annual funding for aerial surveillance activities under the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which helps the region combat illegal fishing. An Albanese Labor government would consult Pacific countries about options for boosting aerial surveillance, such as increasing flying hours and the number of aircraft, improving sensors, and using drones. Surveillance could also be expanded to cover other security risks, including drug trafficking. Labor will also pledge to deepen existing links between the Australian defence force and its regional counterparts by setting up a new Australia-Pacific Defence School at a cost of $6.5m over four years. The school would train members of defence and security forces from Pacific island countries, with a focus on noncommissioned officer level uniformed personnel. Labor believes the new school will complement the existing Australia Pacific Security College, which is run by Australian National University and which targets senior officials and leaders with a focus on research and strategic issues. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, said: “Rather than just talking tough, we will provide practical support for our neighbours to improve their security and protect their economies.” Another plank of the plan was focused on regional broadcasting, which was seen as a key lever of “soft power”. Labor would draw up an Indo-Pacific Broadcasting Strategy to “boost Australian content and to project Australian identity, values, and interests to the Indo-Pacific region”. This would include an $8m a year increase in funding to the ABC’s international program aimed at expanding ABC regional transmission and content production. Labor would use the strategy to review the potential restoration of Australian shortwave radio broadcasting capacity in the Pacific. The shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, accused the government of complacency. “It costs us very little to tell a positive story about Australia in the region, but Scott Morrison has squandered Australia’s natural advantage of shared values with Pacific neighbours,” she said. The plan is also expected to include more support for climate infrastructure in the region and a resumption of bipartisan parliamentary trips to Pacific countries. Labor is also set to promise to improve Pacific labour arrangements to address economic challenges in the Pacific and ease Australia’s agricultural worker shortages. The opposition is mindful of the need to include safeguards to prevent worker exploitation. Morrison has been seeking to project strength on national security ahead of the 21 May election, but that message has been complicated by the finalisation of Beijing’s security agreement with Solomon Islands. The draft security agreement raised the possibility China could “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands”, while Chinese forces could be used “to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. Labor characterised the deal as the biggest Australian foreign policy failure in the Pacific since the second world war, but Morrison said China was exerting “enormous pressure” on Pacific island countries and did not “play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies”. Morrison has sought to rely on assurances from the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, that Solomon Islands will not allow a military base. On Sunday, Morrison was asked to clarify what he meant by his statement that Australia shared “the same red line that the United States has when it comes to these issues”. “We won’t be having Chinese military naval bases in our region on our doorstep,” Morrison told reporters. Pressed on what Australia would actually do to stop such a prospect, Morrison said Sogavare had been clear that there would be no bases “and so he clearly shares our red line”. The Coalition has previously bristled at suggestions it had dropped the ball in the Pacific, insisting Solomon Islands is Australia’s third largest aid recipient overall, and the second largest in the Pacific region after Papua New Guinea. Labor has cited figures showing Australia’s bilateral official development assistance to Solomon Islands averaged $167.5m a year under the Coalition government, or about 28% lower than the $231.6m average under the former government. But the Australian government said it had offered additional assistance to the Pacific in separate programs, including Covid-related help.",News/Australia news,Labor pledges more foreign aid to Pacific with plan ‘to restore Australia’s place as first partner of choice’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/26/labor-pledges-more-foreign-aid-to-pacific-with-plan-to-restore-australias-place-as-first-partner-of-choice

4/26/2022,"That first training session. Has ever a training session been so romanticised and mythologised as Paul Pogba’s first for Juventus in 2012? Is there a training session you would rather have been there to see in the flesh? “He is not real,” Giorgio Chiellini remembers thinking as they watched their new teenage magician at work. “Are they blind in Manchester?” Gigi Buffon exclaimed. “We were just laughing in total disbelief,” Andrea Pirlo later wrote. “That a player with so much obvious quality was able to leave a club the size of Manchester United for free.” Well, you can write your own joke there. And yet as United prepare to part ways with Pogba for a second time, having spent almost £90m to buy him back, you will find very few at the club who feel even the slightest twinge of regret. “Fuck off,” the United fans roared at him as he was substituted against Norwich last week, six years of bottled frustration finally finding its voice. This will, in all likelihood, be Pogba’s epitaph at United: a profligate indulgence, an expensive failure, a player who can be safely jettisoned with the minimum of fuss. At which point it is probably necessary to urge a little pause for reflection. Yes, this is probably for the best. No, an increasingly injury-prone 29-year-old on £200,000 a week is probably not the best man to have hanging around the place as you begin a cultural reset under a new manager. But the predominant emotion here should be not relief or vindictiveness but sadness: that English football never really saw the best of a player who really could do it all. It all feels like hyperbole now, but it wasn’t. When Pirlo warned that “football should get ready for a new king”, or Patrick Vieira described him as “the next great French midfielder”, or Zinedine Zidane claimed he could be “one of the best players ever”, they were simply expressing what the educated eye was already telling them. Even now, there remains enormous respect for Pogba beyond these shores, particularly in Turin where he won four scudetti with Juventus who, for all their Aaron Ramsey and Weston McKennie-flavoured experiments, have never really managed to replace him. This is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. On the contrary: if United are serious about examining where things have gone wrong for them, it’s probably worth analysing how and why they managed to squander this generational talent. Because if the answer is simply “it was his own fault” or “he wasn’t good enough”, then they are in grave danger of making exactly the same mistakes. Even now there remains a basic misunderstanding of what Pogba was supposed to be doing at United. Even now fans and pundits complain that he didn’t “dominate” enough, didn’t take games “by the scruff of the neck”, whatever that means. Evidently that world-record fee created its own choking expectations of a midfielder who would win games on his own; Roy Keane and Paul Scholes and Michael Carrick all in one. Hey, star footballer. We buy you. Win us things. Make us big again. Whose fault was that, really? Shortly after joining United, Ed Woodward – then a vice-chairman – gave an interview in which he complained that the club only had two names on the 25-man Ballon d’Or shortlist. “I don’t like that,” he said. “We should be aspiring to have the best players playing for us.” And so like Ángel di María and Falcao before him, like Alexis Sánchez and Cristiano Ronaldo after him, Pogba was the right player signed for the wrong reasons: the product of a grotesque star fetish that has set United back a decade. Future historians of United will gape at the delusions that gripped them during that era, a kind of madness, a narcissism bordering on megalomania. “The level of engagement and fervour we get is on par with the world’s major religions,” Richard Arnold, then managing director, said, and instead of being thrown out of the club for crimes against sanity he was promoted to chief executive: the sort of decision that can only really be taken by people who don’t know football, who don’t even really like it very much, except as an accessory to their own personal enrichment. Into this void stepped Pogba, all dabs and hashtags, all cute passing triangles but nobody to triangulate them with, a plethora of mixed messages and fluctuating emotions. Commercially he was indispensable. Fans would change their opinion of him by the week. Pundits would get weirdly enraged by him for reasons they couldn’t really place: just this sense of different worlds, different energies, a force they couldn’t quite understand and so ended up criticising with statements like: “His hair looks ridiculous.” There were strong rumours that he played computer games and owned a car. It’s a fair criticism to point out that Pogba hasn’t really improved in six years at United. But then, who has? United is where talent goes to wither, a team with billions in the bank that is heading for the Uefa Conference League, and to place the blame squarely at Pogba’s feet is a bit like turning up at the scene of an arson and arresting the lighter fluid. Pogba rejoined United at 23 and now looks set to leave at 29. These were his best years, his footballing prime, and he gave them to a club that now actively despises him. For all this, there remains a sense of promise unfulfilled, of dreams unrealised: a departure that should be mourned, not scorned.",Sport/Football,"Paul Pogba’s wasted prime should be a cause for sadness, not scorn | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/25/paul-pogbas-wasted-prime-should-be-a-cause-for-sadness-not-sneering
