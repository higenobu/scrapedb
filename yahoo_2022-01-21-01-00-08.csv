1/21/2022,"Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey were subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee on Wednesday, letters show. They are said to have received large bitcoin donations from a French programmer weeks before the riot. Both men reportedly helped plan the pro-Trump rallies that preceded the Capitol riot. The January 6 committee subpoenaed two far-right activists said to have received a combined $275,000 worth of bitcoin from a French computer programmer weeks before the Capitol riot, letters released Wednesday by the panel show. Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey have both promoted voter-fraud claims about the 2020 presidential and, as Politico reported, were outside the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Both of them helped plan the protests that preceded the insurrection, NBC News reported earlier this week. The letter cited the NBC News reported that said Fuentes and Casey were both being investigated by the FBI after receiving a large donation in bitcoin from a French computer programmer less than a month before the insurrection. Fuentes was paid $250,000 and Casey was paid $25,000, according to the letters, which cite a Chainalysis 2021 Crypto Crime report published last year. The donor, who was not identified, is now dead, that report said. The FBI is ""scrutinizing to assess whether the money was linked to the Capitol attack or otherwise used to fund illegal acts,"" the letter addressed to Fuentes said. The FBI is also investigating whether foreign governments, organizations, or individuals helped fund the protests that preceded the Capitol riot, NBC News reported this week. The FBI did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The letters also said that Fuentes and Casey repeatedly made efforts to challenge the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election leading up to the deadly Capitol riot. At a November 2020 rally in Washington, Fuentes encouraged supporters to ""storm every state capitol"" until ""Trump is inaugurated for four more years,"" the letter said. According to the House committee's letter to Fuentes, he also told his Telegram followers as Trump supporters stormed the building: ""It's happening."" Fuentes first gained national attention after attending the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, according to the Anti-Defamation League. According to The Daily Beast, he responded to the committee's letter by saying on Telegram: ""They couldn't give me my own post? What a rip,"" referring to the committee's Twitter post about both Fuentes and Casey's subpoenas. Casey could not be reached for comment. Fuentes and Casey join a growing list of Trump supporters and allies — including the former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and advisor Steve Bannon — who have been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee.

1/21/2022,"WORCESTER, Mass. — A Massachusetts man and pizza shop owner died while waiting for a hospital bed to open up after contracting COVID-19 Antonios “Tony” Tsantinis, 68, of East Brookfield died Dec. 10. He had fallen ill just after Thanksgiving and his longtime companion, Angela DiUlio, was sick, too. During a trip to the emergency room, they both tested positive for COVID-19. They posted on social media Nov. 30, letting people know their business Athens Pizza would be closed, a rare event, due to their positive tests. Tsantinis was admitted to a hospital in Southbridge after his daughter, Rona Tsantinis-Roy, realized he had become a lot sicker. He needed additional care that the hospital was unable to provide and a search ensued for an available hospital bed. ""They called every hospital within 75 miles,"" Tsantinis-Roy said, adding that by the time there was a spot for him at a Connecticut hospital, he was too sick to be transferred. As he battled COVID-19, his kidneys began to fail and he needed dialysis, according to NPR. A short time later, Tsantinis-Roy and her brother, Andy Tsantinis, saw their dad, but it was to say goodbye. ""He literally looked me in the eyes and said this didn't have to happen,"" Tsantinis-Roy recounted to NPR when the doctor told her that her father was dead.

1/21/2022,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — BNSF railroad wants a federal judge to prevent two of its unions from going on strike next month over a new attendance policy that would penalize employees for missing work. The Fort Worth, Texas-based railroad went to court after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, and the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation union both threatened to strike over the new policy that is set to go into effect on Feb. 1. The unions said they are surveying their 17,000 members who work for BNSF to see if workers will support a strike. The heads of the two unions, BLET National President Dennis Pierce and SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson, said in a joint statement that the new policy would violate their contracts with BNSF and could provide an incentive for workers to show up when they are sick in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. “This unprecedented BNSF policy repudiates direct and clear contract language, and in application, will attempt to force our members to report for duty without regard for their medical condition as we struggle to come out of a pandemic,” Pierce and Ferguson said. The railroad maintains that this issue is a minor dispute that the unions wouldn't be allowed to strike over under federal law, and a strike shouldn't be allowed because it would hurt the economy too much. “Rail strikes — even if brief or localized — can cause devastating and irreparable harm to carriers, their customers, other railroads, and the general public. The threatened strike in this case would strain an already overburdened supply chain, potentially causing wide-ranging harm to the national economy,” BNSF said in its lawsuit. BNSF said it hasn't updated its attendance policy in 20 years, so it came up with the new system to give its employees an easier way to see where they stand under the rules. A hearing will be held Monday to determine whether the judge will block the threatened strike. BNSF, one of the nation's largest railroads, operates 32,500 miles of track in 28 western states.",U.S./Associated Press,"BNSF railroad tries to block 17,000 workers from striking",https://news.yahoo.com/bnsf-railroad-tries-block-17-175117868.html
