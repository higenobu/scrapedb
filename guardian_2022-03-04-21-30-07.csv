3/4/2022,"Monday The nearest thing New York has to the Imperial War Museum in London is the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, built on and around the USS Intrepid, a hulking great aircraft carrier parked at Pier 86 on the Hudson River. It is the obligation of every school age-child in greater New York to attend this museum at least once a year, and on the last day of mid-winter recess, we do. It’s an odd time in which to find oneself in a museum of war. The Intrepid was in service from 1943 through to the 1970s, when it acted as an anti-submarine vessel tracking Soviet submarines in the north Atlantic. Most of the exhibits focus on Vietnam, with a display of faded we-regret-to-inform you telegrams, dog tags, and oral accounts of life on board ship. A special exhibit explores the nuclear submarines of the old war and invites visitors to imagine how it may have felt to live on the brink of nuclear annihilation. The poignancy of the old photos, depicting young men in sepia tones squinting up at the camera, is accompanied by a sense of the endless squandering of young human life, and the head-spinning consideration that the events of this week will, in all probability, be pasted on to these same museum walls one day, to interest and bore future children. The Intrepid also discreetly communicates to visitors the terrors of even the mildest simulation of combat experience. Accompanied by one child at a time, I enter the two-seat “G-Force experience” ride, where I am flipped upside down, freak out as my child starts to slip through her harness, reach to hit the emergency stop button, am promptly flipped back around again, and leave the ride wondering if I’m going to throw up. Afterwards, we walk to the submarine, which is parked alongside the Intrepid and open for visitors, but are all far too claustrophobic to go in. Will history remember the ancillary role played by Liz Truss this week? It is wrong, perhaps, to be even darkly amused by this, and yet the Kremlin blaming its escalation to nuclear readiness on the words of the British foreign secretary, has about it the air of a shelved Mr Bean storyline. Here she is, our hapless heroine – leaver of weird pauses, enemy of Britain’s cheese import policies, wearer of Perestroika-era hats – inadvertently triggering events that may lead to the end of the world. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Truss said, “This long-running conflict is about freedom and democracy in Europe,” a bland enough statement that was, nonetheless, seized on by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, and denounced as so “unacceptable” as to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. It wasn’t Truss’s fault, of course. She might have said anything, as she so frequently does, and the response from the Kremlin would have been the same. “If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine,” she continued, “we are going to see others under threat: the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato”. Rallying every shred of Churchillian eloquence, Truss ended with the ominous observation that “we do not want to go there”, as true a thing as has ever been said. We totes don’t want to go there, Liz. For realz. Watching Trump speak in public was never a relaxing affair, but watching Biden can be almost as bad. On Wednesday morning, political analysts pick over his performance in the State of the Union address the previous night, highlighting his plans to discourage Putin, curb inflation, and unite Americans in the cause of world freedom. For me, however, the speech was notable for the moment-by-moment terror of wondering if Biden would stumble, freeze, or forget his words, and how this would play to hostile eyes on the other side of the world. At 79, Biden is 10 years older than Putin, and at the risk of sounding unpatriotic, on Tuesday night he looked his age. I found myself casting around for reassurances. It was useful to remember, when he fluffed his lines, appeared to lose his place, and seemed to say “Iranian” instead of “Ukrainian”, that Biden was like this even as a much younger politician. There was reassurance to be had, too, in seeing the youthful figure of Kamala Harris sitting squarely behind him. And, in spite of the shonky pacing of his speech, Biden’s delivery still has the power to soothe. On Tuesday night, he slipped momentarily out of a more uniform style into full twinkle mode, saying twice over, and with sufficient theatre to make it sound as if he was half-addressing himself, “we’re going to be OK, we’re going to be OK”. If it was hokey to some and empty to others, something about the audacity of whimsy worked for me. Photos of Rihanna in a “pregnancy thong” – a sheer black neglige beneath which the antithesis of big pregnancy pants are clearly visible – flash round the world midweek after her appearance for Dior in Paris, and are universally received by the fashion press as wonderful. Rih’s pregnancy look is, says Glamour, “to be applauded”. Vogue.com calls it “sensational”. She has “redefined pregnancy style”, gushes BuzzFeed. Kneejerk fawning aside – Rhianna could have shown up in wardrobe from the Crucible to be met with exactly the same response – it seems to me that, rather than 4in heels and fishnets, a more radical choice may have been to rock up in a velour tracksuit and flats, gnawing on a foot-long sandwich from Subway, and begging everyone’s pardon for occasional pregnancy flatulence. But that would never do, would it? In among the horror, it’s useful to remember there was good news this week. The Queen recovered from Covid, great news for the Queen, and also for shift journalists braced for all-leave-cancelled had the outcome been different. The beloved children’s author Shirley Hughes died at the age of 94, not good news, obviously, but it did lead to the internet being flooded with images that are stamped on our hearts. There were Alfie and Annie Rose, a reminder of what the mess and beauty of childhood should look like. And after an experiment lasting several years, Amazon announced it would be closing all 68 of its bricks and mortar stores, those ersatz bookshops in which titles were grouped according to how many ratings they had garnered on Amazon. (The category “more than 10,000 reviews” ensured, with no involvement from human intelligence necessary, prominent placement of books with the word “orphan” in the title, or anything by Bill O’Reilly).

3/4/2022,"The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian that further sanctions were being considered, which could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally-friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. As an example of how the events in Europe may drive up prices, the minister explained: “I’ve been talking to the pig industry, a very, very difficult supply chain at all levels – are we prepared to buy more British high-welfare pigs? We will have to pay more.” She added that while environmental policies were still a priority, “we need to make sure that the policy we’re making at every stage is correct to the stage we’re in. And frankly the stage for this week is completely different from the stage we were in last week.” There are fears of a wheat crisis on the continent, as Russia and Ukraine account for 14% of global wheat production and rank first and fifth, respectively. The countries together account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports. Prentis has been meeting her counterparts in Europe to discuss this. She said: “I am so grateful that in this country we grow 88% of the wheat we eat. I met the Albanian foreign minister earlier this week, who imports 44% of her wheat – in a very poor country – from Ukraine. We are in a very fortunate position in many ways.” Another battle Prentis has been fighting is with her Conservative colleagues who have criticised the Elms scheme. Some of her critics argue that farmers should be given more subsidies for producing food rather than solely for environmental goods. The Conservative MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment select committee, recently said: “There is an issue of food security, because Ukraine is the breadbasket of the world, as is the western part of Russia: I have visited Bryansk in the past and I remember that the one thing I wanted to bring home with me was the soil. I have never seen such beautiful soil in my life. It can grow absolutely everything. “As we change agricultural policy, we need to protect the environment but we need food. There is not enough food in the Agriculture Act.” Prentis said of her critics: “I really feel that we’ve got to stop viewing ourselves as environmentalists or farmers and there being any sort of boundary between the two. “Quite frankly, it really pisses me off that so many of us are on board with this programme and we are going in one direction but that we are having these ridiculous arguments about which bit [of funding] goes where in the programme.”",News/Environment,"UK pork prices likely to rise due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister
3/4/2022,"A coroner has described as “woefully inadequate” the information and treatment available for a 24-year-old problem gambler who took his own life in Vietnam. David Urpeth, the Sheffield coroner, on Friday delivered a narrative conclusion into the inquest of Jack Ritchie, a gambling addict who was teaching English in Hanoi. His parents, Charles and Liz Ritchie, had tenaciously fought for an inquest that not only examined their son’s death but also state regulation of the gambling industry. The coroner did not rule that any arm of the state had breached any duty to protect Ritchie’s life. It is believed to be the first time article 2 of the Human Rights Act has been engaged in a case relating to suicide after gambling. That meant its scope included examining whether any arm of the state breached its duty to protect Ritchie’s right to life. Engaging article 2 had been opposed by lawyers representing the government. Urpeth said it was clear that Ritchie was addicted to gambling and that the availability of treatment and information on its dangers were, before his death in 2017, “woeful”. Things have improved but there was still “significantly more” that needed to be done. The Ritchie family argued that gambling killed their son. “It was the long-term root and the short-term trigger of Jack’s death,” they said. Urpeth said that was a step too far. Instead he said it was “abundantly clear” that gambling contributed to Ritchie’s death. Ritchie’s gambling problem began when he was a sixth former, betting small stakes at a betting shop on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). It escalated over time, with Ritchie gambling away money left to him by his grandmother, his student loan while studying history at Hull University and, while he was in Vietnam, his overdraft. The parents also argued that the state failed in its duty of care to their son and wanted to hold the state to account for failing to regulate the gambling industry properly. They said there were no public health warnings about the risk to life posed by gambling products. Their son, the inquest heard, was not diagnosed or offered treatment that linked his symptoms to a gambling disorder. The couple set up a charity, Gambling With Lives, to support affected families and raise awareness of the dangers gambling brings. The campaign says “very normal, bright, popular and happy young folk” are killing themselves and “gambling was their only problem.” Ritchie was described by his father as “big in physique and in personality … big in heart and in spirit”. Witnesses at the inquest included Sarah Gardner, the deputy chief executive of the Gambling Commission. It was put to her that action in addressing gambling-related suicide had been disappointing. “I wouldn’t disagree with that,” she said. Another witness was Jonathan Marron, a senior civil servant at the Department of Health and Social Care, who said: “I don’t think there’s any dispute that there’s an association between gambling and suicide.” As his session finished, Marron, the director general for the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, choked back tears as he acknowledged the trauma Jack’s parents had been through. He was the father of a teenage daughter, he said. “It’s clear that the work you have done has had a significant role in changing the focus of this issue.” Everything changed for Ritchie, the inquest heard, when he won £1,000 in less than 30 seconds. From then on it was about chasing his losses and waiting for the big win. Ritchie killed himself in Hanoi in November 2017. Forensic evidence presented to the inquest showed he was a regular visitor to the BetVictor online gambling website in the days leading up to his death. His father told the inquest he had spoken to Jack’s friends. “They had all known that Jack gambled, but no one had understood the nature of the addiction,” he said. “No one had thought that his life might be in danger. So many of them said if he had been taking hard drugs they would have spoken to him. They would have warned him. They would have spoken to us. “But, actually, all they had seen was their brilliant friend being the same as he had always been – an enormous personality that they looked forward to meeting up with and having a laugh.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/4/2022,"If, last year, I’d had to guess where the restaurant scene would thrive in 2022, the Canary Wharf district would have felt most improbable. Sure, this was once deemed London’s highest-earning postcode, but none of that was benefiting the restaurant world when the employees of its banks were working in pyjamas in Berkshire. And, pandemic aside, Canary Wharf has never been anyone’s idea of a charming dining destination, despite being in parts twinkly, luxurious and curiously Bladerunner-ish. To see it become the focus of big players such as Hawksmoor, Caravan, Marugame Udon and a new hulking Market Halls says a lot about how confident investors are of a return to desks. The days of dressing gowns and Joe Wicks workouts were officially over when Hawksmoor unveiled its most ostentatious opening to date: a vast, shimmering restaurant in Wood Wharf. Half steakhouse, half love boat, it floats on the water in the middle of 23 acres of residential and working space, currently heavily marketed as a place for Londoners to live, laugh, love and pedal their Pelotons in flats that cost £400k for a bijou one-bed. Caravan’s arrival suggests that there is an expectation that the wharf will no longer be a weekend ghost town, but instead a place to fritter your free time. The much-loved Patty & Bun, purveyors of the Ari Gold burger,will arrive in May, while the increasingly cherished Emilia’s Crafted Pasta has just opened, and Six By Nico, about which I have already made my feelings clear, is gearing up to serve its multi-course Ancient Rome-themed tasting menu from mid-March. While heating bills and staff shortages have made buying a cup of coffee before 11am in Soho a gargantuan feat, over in E14, the all-day brunch is thriving. And on a wet, windy Wednesday night in February, it’s a push to get a table for two at Hawksmoor Wood Wharf. Perhaps what diners see in Hawksmoor is warm dependability. Yes, this new place may have the air of a New Orleans steam cruiser that has mated with an All Bar One, but it nevertheless offers the same high-quality porterhouse, T-bone and chateaubriand that have made diners open their wallets since 2006. Hawksmoor has danced a dainty jig over the past 16 years, expanding and becoming part of the food-scene furniture, while never quite straying to naffness. It remains to millions of people something of a treat – regardless that there are now branches in Edinburgh, Manchester and New York; that steak is as du jour to young people right now as Chico Time; and that the Angus Steakhouse in Covent Garden has been turned into a Mildred’s vegan restaurant. Unsurprisingly, Hawksmoor at Canary Wharf does not parade its trays of raw meat around the tables for the diners to ooh and ahh at. Instead, there’s a more discreet offering of now-departed cow, as well as a good selection of oysters with scotch bonnet mignonette, and roast oysters with bone marrow. The smoked mackerel salad with horseradish and new potatoes is great, as is the ash-baked beetroot with pickled fennel. A subtle repurposing of Hawksmoor seems to have gone on, almost undetected, over the past few years; with mains of charred romesco with hazelnuts, peanuts and sesame appearing on the menu, plus a very good charcoal-roasted halibut, which I’ve eaten on a couple of occasions with a side of very buttery mash and gravy, plus a lovable creamed spinach that wraps itself around your chest like a culinary cuddle. A visit to Hawksmoor may not be the glittering, braggable occasion it was was 15 years ago, when you’d book months in advance for Sunday lunch and stagger out four hours later, packed tightly with prime rib. Yet there is still something reassuringly special about a secluded, flatteringly-lit table for two, a hunk of rare ribeye with anchovy hollandaise and some triple-fried chips, thenthe clotted cream and sticky toffee pudding sundae, which comes in a tall glass with two spoons, glistening with almost too much sauce and the suggestion that the Peloton torture can recommence tomorrow. We fought our way inthrough crowds at 5.30pm and, as we paid up, they promptly turned our table. In a food landscape filled with uncertainty, where many small restaurateurs are too scared to turn on their lights, Hawksmoor Wood Wharf is operating on full tractor beam, channelling ebullient, 100-watt certainty. I don’t know where we’re all going, but in Canary Wharf, at least for now, the future’s so bright, I’ve got to wear shades. Hawksmoor Wood Wharf, 1 Water Street, London E14, 020-3988 0510. Open lunch Tues-Sun, noon-2.30pm (4pm Sun); dinner Mon–Sat, 5-11pm.

3/4/2022,"Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in Her Head by Warsan Shire (Chatto, £12.99)Shire’s first full-length collection builds on her much admired pamphlets Teaching My Mother How to Give Birth and Her Blue Body. Intergenerational trauma arising from the legacy of war, colonialism and the ongoing refugee crisis are addressed with a painful and urgent clarity. In her notable poem “Home”, Shire writes, “No one leaves home unless home is the mouth of a shark. You only / run for the border when you see the whole city running as well. / The boy you went to school with, who kissed you dizzy behind the / old tin factory, is holding a gun bigger than his body.” The need to reclaim ownership over one’s body is another key theme, especially in the wake of sexual trauma. In “Backwards”, a specular poem in which the latter half mirrors the first, Shire invokes the creative powers of the writer to transform one’s past: “Give them stumps for hands if even once they touched us without consent, / I can write the poem and make it disappear.” Vital, moving and courageous, this is a debut not to be missed. Vinegar Hill by Colm Tóibín (Carcanet, £12.99)Tóibín’s debut collection consists of lyric and narrative poems that traverse multiple physical locales and emotional landscapes, from Enniscorthy to Budapest to Los Angeles. A renowned novelist, Tóibín brings his keen eye for vivid narrative detail. In a candid poem about his visit to the White House on Saint Patrick’s Day in 2010, he writes: “We had expected to learn something in that house about power / And politics. Instead, we witnessed what it is like / To wear your welcome out. It does seem tempting, even still, / To imagine the line of waiters as a metaphor … / For soft power […] how to take a firm stance / On foreigners.” There is a lingering melancholyin Tóibín’s work, particularly in his sparse reflections on ageing and death: “In the book that points the way, / I found words and signs that served only / To mystify me further. It is not easy / For anyone being in the world”. Much of Vinegar Hill offers the pleasure of a slow, meandering walk, as if the reader and poet have companionably “decid[ed] to take / The slow way home”. Unexhausted Time by Emily Berry (Faber, £10.99)Berry’s third collection marks a departure from its predecessor Stranger, Baby, which was a polyphonic meditation on loss, survival and grief. While related themes emerge, to read her latest work is to be immersed in a shimmering world of dream logic, where lyric fragments cohere and disassemble like the passage of light over the course of a single day. Here, Berry’s writing mimics time’s uneven flow: “The past is our country: pawned, / broke down and unforgiveable, governed / by people we cannot trust, and we live in it.” Ellipses abound, revealing an omission of thought or feeling, thereby heightening what does appear on the page: “When someone leaves you, / they flow out of you like milk, / and if you allow it, you can feed people …” . Those familiar with Berry’s debut Dear Boy might observe how Unexhausted Time moves similarly between the “apparently personal” – a term coined by Sharon Olds – and surrealist scenes. Berry writes: “I agree, sometimes there is a soft core /of rot inside everything. But the poem / was blood temperature, and getting / hotter.” Wise and mesmeric, Unexhausted Time feels like a balm for mind and soul in difficult times. Some Integrity by Padraig Regan (Carcanet, £11.99)This scintillating debut is Whitmanesque in its freewheeling explorations of subjects ranging from mushrooms to Rembrandt to the landscapes of Ireland. Regan notes in an interview how “queerness is never a subject matter, but a way of looking, a perspective, a formal approach, a syntax”. In a poem suffused with eroticism, the speaker brings a queer perspective to bear on their appreciation of the carnivorous pitcher plant, “who accepts / whatever comes its way – the living, / the dead, & all their mixed excretions”. The mouth recurs as a motif that gestures at the link between hunger and desire, as in the following prose poem: “… if I licked this stone / in search of salt & oil or / bit down expecting the / soft resistance of well- / cooked pig, I would be / disappointed. I don’t / know if that would stop / me.” Ultimately, there is a deft precision to Regan’s work that is captivating. To read Some Integrity is to come away convinced that each poem is “a space … shaped to hold / the desire [the poet has] nowhere else / to put but here”.

3/4/2022,"You probably know what to expect from a band called Blood Incantation: pulverising blast beats; jagged, discordant riffs; vocals seemingly sourced from the killing floor of an abattoir. And, by and large, you’d be right. For most of the acclaimed Coloradan death metal band’s career, that’s been the playbook (give or take some intriguingly psychedelia-tinged detours). But for their new album, Blood Incantation have drastically changed tack. Timewave Zero bins off the aforementioned growling and howling for a pair of ambient “suites” – moody, droney synth tracks that, while not “heavy” in the traditional sense, retain an air of menace and foreboding. “Now that we’ve proven we can do both metal and ambient, we’re totally free to just be Blood Incantation,” the band told the Guardian. Blood Incantation aren’t the only band to have embraced less punishing textures in their music of late. Deafheaven, previously purveyors of “blackgaze”, a skyscraping mix of black metal and shoegaze, abandoned the former bit of that portmanteau on their most recent album Infinite Granite, a collection of rather pleasant, largely mid-tempo dream-pop songs. And even the bands that aren’t entirely casting off their brutality seem to be dabbling in surprising sonic textures these days. You can hear it in the Warp Records-esque glitches that pepper Code Orange’s brilliant, bruising alternative metal, the sinister synthscapes of the otherwise relentless metalcore act Vein.fm, or the woozy excursions with Dev Hynes, AKA Blood Orange, from backflipping hardcore heroes Turnstile. Of course plenty of metal bands have shown signs of sonic adventurism in the past, but for a world that is often characterised as po-faced and rigid, divided up into militantly enforced sub-categories (doom, thrash, nü, black… and let’s not get into the many genres ending in -core), there does seem to be something in the water at present. It comes at a time when defining what “heavy” even means is becoming more challenging. Heaviness, as Dom Lawson points out in his valiant attempt to determine the heaviest music ever made, encompasses acts as diametrically opposed as Motörhead and the impenetrable electronic noise artist Merzbow (aside: I very much enjoyed the wag who wrote “my mother used to sing this to me when I was a boy” in the comments of this YouTube video). Some of the heaviest music I’ve experienced in the last decade or so, at least in its throbbing, unremitting sense of oppressiveness, is by Blanck Mass, a techno artist and film scorer whose previous band had a song played at the Olympics‘ opening ceremony. Dillinger Escape Plan he is not, but he captures an essential part of what I associate with “heaviness”. Even so, there seem to be hints of more traditional heaviness everywhere you look these days. Glossy pop stars like Rina Sawayama and Poppy chuck in the odd drop-D riff or get out the double kick drum pedal to spice things up a bit. Hitherto indie-ish bands like the Horrors are embracing their inner Nine Inch Nails. 100 Gecs drop shards of piercing noise into the middle of otherwise cheesy hyperpop songs. In this fractious, bordering on terrifying moment, sonic abrasion seems to be the default mode. You can hear it in the post-punk revival, or drill and grime, or even at the movies with their punishing surround sound and booming superhero soundtracks (that whoommmmp noise you hear in every trailer is nothing if not heavy). Even if the metal bands are getting less metal-y, we’re living in a new age of loud.

Freedom is tantalisingly close, if they beat Chelsea and Everton lose at Tottenham then Burnley will climb free. With all the turmoil surrounding Roman Abramovich’s sale of Chelsea, one could argue there is no better time to try to catch them off guard. Luton almost did on Wednesday in the Cup but it is fairly likely that Thomas Tuchel’s team talk at half-time reminded Chelsea of their status. Sean Dyche’s side will put up a fight but they may be better off saving their energy for a huge relegation crunch match with Brentford next week.
