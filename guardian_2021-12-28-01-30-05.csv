12/28/2021,"Covid cases in the UK have remained high, with 98,515 new confirmed cases reported on Monday as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a winter wave of infections. The latest official data also reveals figures for Christmas Day and Boxing Day, for which 113,628 and 108,893 daily cases have been reported respectively. However, as experts have noted, figures around Christmas may not give a true picture of the situation – not least as people may be less likely to have a Covid test.  “Data will be unreliable over the festive period as testing and hospital admission patterns change. This will make it difficult to interpret any apparent trends over the next few days,” documents released on Thursday by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) warned.

12/28/2021,"Donald Trump’s loss-making Scottish golf resorts claimed in excess of £3.3m in emergency support from the UK government, to help furlough staff during the Covid pandemic. Company accounts for the former president’s resorts at Turnberry in Ayrshire and Balmedie, north of Aberdeen, show his businesses cut 273 jobs due to the Covid crisis last year, while also claiming £2.8m in furlough support.  Other government data shows Trump Turnberry and Trump International Scotland in Aberdeenshire then made further claims this year while the UK government’s job retention scheme was still in force. The BBC reported those claims, not yet included in the Trump companies’ accounts, were worth between £520,000 and £1.3m, leading to a total claim for furlough funding of between £3.3m and £4.1m overall. The resorts reported heavy losses due to their enforced closure during the lockdowns: the headline loss for Turnberry was £3.4m, after a £321,000 profit in 2019, and £1.3m at Balmedie, compared to a loss of £1.1m in 2019. The accounts also show both resorts owe more money to Trump: loans from the former president’s own funds and the holding company he controls to both businesses now total £159m. The accounts report the assets – the land, buildings and equipment – at Turnberry are worth £86m, and £32m for the Aberdeenshire resort. The accounts suggest the family holding company injected £1.1m into the Balmedie business to help with day-to-day cashflow after it was forced to close the resort’s boutique hotel, named after his Scottish mother, Mary MacLeod, for the whole of 2020. It did not reopen until April this year. The accounts show the headcount at Turnberry, which has a five-star hotel, holiday lodges, a spa, ballroom and two championship golf courses, fell from an average of 541 employees in 2019 to 289 in 2020. At the much smaller Aberdeenshire resort, average staffing dropped from 84 posts to 63 last year. In a foreword to the accounts, Trump’s son Eric, who was given day-to-day control of the businesses after his father won the presidency, said the UK government’s cash was helpful because it helped retain staff. Many were later rehired, he said. “Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, however uncertainty of [sic] the duration of support and the pandemic’s sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long-term effects to the hospitality industry,” he said. Global controls on air travel, particularly from the US golfing visitors; the impacts on staffing, supply chains and costs from Brexit; and general inflation, had all hit the Trump businesses, he added. Confirmation that the Trump resorts have had more than £3.3m in furlough support could have implications for a US House of Representatives investigation into whether the former president has broken a clause in the constitution which prohibits US presidents from seeking and receiving financial rewards or benefits from foreign governments. The Guardian reported last year that Trump’s Scottish resorts were expected to receive property tax rebates of nearly £1m because business rate payments for hospitality and tourism businesses had been suspended due to the pandemic. The US Congress passed legislation prohibiting businesses in which Trump holds a stake from receiving any Covid-related bail-out funds. Under Scottish and UK legislation, his Scottish resorts were given the same rights to claim as any other comparable business.",News/UK news,Donald Trump golf resorts claimed at least £3.3m in UK furlough support,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/27/donald-trump-golf-resorts-claimed-at-least-33m-in-uk-furlough-support
12/28/2021,"The father of a man arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle allegedly in possession of a crossbow has reportedly said “something’s gone horribly wrong with our son”. The Metropolitan police are investigating a video, which has been linked to the 19-year-old suspect, who was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon and was subsequently sectioned under the Mental Health Act.  The video, obtained by the Sun, appears to show a masked figure in a dark hoodie holding a crossbow and addressing the camera with a distorted voice, saying they want to “assassinate the Queen” in a “revenge” mission for the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre. MailOnline reported that the man’s father said: “Something’s gone horribly wrong with our son and we are trying to figure out what. “We’ve not had a chance to speak to him but are trying to get him the help he needs. From our perspective, we are going through a difficult time. We are trying to resolve this issue and it’s not easy.” The Queen spent Christmas Day at Windsor Castle and was expected to have lunch with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Charles, Camilla, Edward and Sophie, the latter couple along with their children Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn, attended a church service in St George’s Chapel, in the castle grounds, at 10.45 on Christmas morning. A spokesperson from Scotland Yard said: “Security processes were triggered within moments of the man entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings. Following a search of the man, a crossbow was recovered.” They added: “Inquiries into the full circumstances of this incident are being progressed by Metropolitan police specialist operations.” In the video obtained by the Sun, the voiceover says: “I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done and what I will do. I will attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, queen of the royal family. This is revenge for those who have died in the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre.” In the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, 379 protesters were killed and 1,200 wounded by British forces in India. The Met would not comment on who appeared in the video but a spokesperson said: “Following the man’s arrest, detectives are assessing the contents of a video.” In 2002, Aaron Barschak, a former comedian, gatecrashed Prince William’s 21st birthday party in an incident that led to a review and ultimately a tightening of security across royal residences. The review also recommended a new offence of trespass into royal or government premises, under which the 19-year-old was arrested on Saturday.",News/UK news,Police investigate video linked to Windsor Castle trespass suspect,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/27/windsor-castle-trespass-suspect-video
12/28/2021,"There were four moments across the first two days of the third Ashes match when the Melbourne Cricket Ground rose, in movement and in voice, to the hometown bowler Scott Boland on his Test debut. The second time was when he took his first wicket, as Ollie Robinson’s dismissal was upheld by the video umpire. The third time was when Boland, batting at No 11, scored his first runs with an edge through the slip cordon.  Those either side were more important. The first, before the match began, when Aunty Joy Murphy Wandin spoke during the welcome to country, noting the rarity of an Indigenous Australian cricketer representing this team. The guttural vocal affirmation from the stands was spontaneous and moving. The fourth time was right at the end of the second day, in the shadow of stumps, when Boland ripped out two English wickets in the space of three balls, his first major influence on the match. Had England ended the day two wickets down, they would have stayed in the contest. At four down, the calculus had drastically changed. Boland’s story is in many ways representative of the treatment of Indigenous Australians in the nation’s modern incarnation. He did not know of his heritage until he was in his 20s, when his family learned that Boland’s grandfather was descended from the Gulidjan people of western Victoria. For so many people and for so long, that kind of heritage had been hidden or ignored. The Boland family embraced it instead, in a process of learning that is still under way. In 2018 I spoke to Boland about this. “Me and my brother [Nick] are both similar,” he said. “We didn’t know what to think at first, but the more we spoke about it with our family and the more people we got to meet through the [Cricket Australia] Indigenous program, the more we understood about where we fit in and how we could help out. Me and Dan Christian chatted about it, and Ben Abbatangelo who was captaining the Australian Indigenous side. So the more we spoke about it, the more we felt comfortable about being involved.” There is no way to flatter Australian cricket’s history with Indigenous people. It is a gulf in the game. Unaarrimin and Murrumgunarrimin, often recorded by the colonial names of Johnny Mullagh and Twopenny, played one first-class match apiece for Victoria and New South Wales respectively in the 1800s. Jack Marsh and Alec Henry played a handful of state matches at the turn of the 20th century, as did Eddie Gilbert in the 1930s. The latter three were all pushed out of the game by spurious rejection of their bowling actions by white umpires and administrators. Two more known Aboriginal cricketers played first-class matches between Gilbert’s last in 1936 and Jason Gillespie’s first in 1995. Until Boland, Gillespie was the only Indigenous man to play Test cricket for Australia, while Faith Thomas in 1958 and Ashleigh Gardner starting in 2019 are the only women. Where Australian rules football and rugby league are now rich with Indigenous heroes, cricket still lags behind. The path to changing this remains long and difficult. All of which means that Boland’s appearance in a baggy green cap would have been hugely significant no matter what he did on the field. The extra layer was added with his dramatic final over on the second day. He was picked in this Ashes XI not for symbolism but for his ability to bash the ball into an often unresponsive MCG deck, where he had previously taken 91 first-class wickets at an average of 25 while others have struggled. The England opener Haseeb Hameed had survived a devastating opening burst from Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc, getting through 30 deliveries and driving Starc down the ground for four. It was a quintessential Boland delivery that knocked him over, a ball slammed into the surface so that it jumped off the seam and took the edge of a haplessly wielded bat. Then England’s use of a nightwatchman came undone, Jack Leach studiously leaving his second delivery on a wider line only to hear it clip his off stump after jagging back in. The spectators lifted in time with Boland’s raised fist. It was a special moment, while one that should not paint a falsely harmonious picture. The MCG is also a ground where Aboriginal champion Adam Goodes was jeered out of Australian rules football after speaking up about the treatment of his people. There remains ugliness aplenty in the relationship between the continent’s original inhabitants and the colonial nation that pushes them to the margins. “You hear the way people talk in the general community, in general conversation, you would hear their remarks and things like that,” Boland said in that interview. “I think the more that people are educated about different cultures, the more they understand. It’s more mainstream now that Indigenous culture is a big part of Australian history and the Australian community.” There is hope in that, and also the reality that each step forward underlines how many are left to take.",Sport/Sport,Scott Boland’s starring role for Australia adds extra layer of significance | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2021/dec/27/scott-bolands-starring-role-cricket-australia-england-ashes
12/28/2021,"They are questions that have cast a shadow over the festive season: will new Covid measures be needed, and if so, when and what form will they take? The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has warned peak admissions could be comparable to, or even greater than, previous peaks without significant behaviour change or further interventions, but many Tory backbenchers have argued against legal restrictions.  Speaking on LBC on Monday morning, senior Tory Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, treasurer of the 1922 Committee, suggested medics “try and make out the worse possible case” and urged the prime minister to be “very, very cautious before introducing further measures”. In the face of opposition from his own MPs, it is thought the prime minister is leaning towards issuing tougher guidance, rather than new legally binding restrictions. Such an approach would avoid the need to recall parliament, which could take several days, and potentially appease backbenchers. But would guidance alone be enough to tackle the threat posed by Omicron? When Prof Chris Whitty urged the public to exercise caution on 15 December, and cut down on social contacts ahead of Christmas, it appeared to strike a chord with the public: retailers reported a far lower footfall than hoped in the run up to the festivities, while pubs and restaurants faced a swathe of cancellations. Sage experts have noted that recently the growth rate of infections has slowed, but it is not yet clear if that is down to a reduction in social mixing – or other factors like people choosing not to get tested. While some have argued that people should “be treated like adults” and messaging alone is enough to change behaviour, others have suggested it may not be enough. Prof Stephen Reicher of the University of St Andrews, and a member of Spi-B – the behavioural sub group of Sage, said that whether advice alone works depends on three key factors – the first of which is whether the source is trusted. A recent Savanta poll found 59% of people in Britain distrust Boris Johnson as a source of guidance on Covid, while a YouGov poll suggests less than a third of the public think the government is handling the coronavirus situation “very” or “somewhat” well. Another factor, said Reicher, is whether the message is clear and the reality of the risk set out. “The problem here is that the government have been consistently messaging that there isn’t a serious risk but they would act if the data suggested there were. So the fact they aren’t introducing measures communicates that there still isn’t a risk and all the headlines will be about that,” he said. Finally, Reicher said people need support to self isolate, make classrooms safe and improve ventilation in public spaces. “The Government’s hands off approach is as much about refusing to provide that support as to avoid any restrictions,” he said.“Giving us our freedom in a storm is akin to abandoning us to our fate.” Prof Susan Michie, director of the UCL Centre for Behaviour Change and also a member of Spi-B, added the impact of legal restrictions versus guidance is highlighted by adherence to mask wearing. “The numbers dipped when there was advice only and then increased again when the legal requirement was reinstated,” she noted. And while some people value personal freedom over and above a collective effort to manage the pandemic, she noted for others a lack of clear rules causes its own problems. “Ambiguity can cause anxiety and strained relationships,” she said. “Rules relieve people of responsibility for deciding what is the best thing to do in situations that are often complex.” Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof John Drury of the University of Sussex, another member of Spi-B, added that messages such as “stay alert” or “be vigilant” are open to multiple interpretations. “Even well-informed people find it hard to keep up with the evidence in this pandemic. We either need clear leadership representing the collective will or properly organised support to equip members of the public with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions,” he said. “Without one or other, we risk a chaotic and dangerous individualism.”",News/World news,Guidance v rules: which Covid measures work better?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/guidance-v-rules-which-covid-measures-work-better
