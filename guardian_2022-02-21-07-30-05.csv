2/21/2022,"AGL Energy has rejected a takeover bid by tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset management giant Brookfield, saying the preliminary offer “materially undervalues the company”. Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures made the extraordinary offer to take over Australia’s most polluting company on Saturday, with a goal to shut its coal power plants earlier than planned.  In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, AGL said it had rejected the unsolicited preliminary offer of $7.50 a share, which offered a 4.7% premium on Friday’s closing price of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the offer was in the range of $8bn. The company said it was not in the best interest of shareholders. Speaking on Monday, Cannon-Brookes said the consortium would continue to work on the potential take over, which would involve Brookfield and Grok Ventures acquiring AGL’s power generation and energy retail divisions, which include coal, gas and renewable energy generation assets. If successful, the new owners would aim to bring forward AGL’s exit from coal-fired power. It would also halt a planned demerger that would have broken off the company’s fossil fuel assets into a separate entity, to be called Accel Energy. AGL chairman Peter Botten said the bid did not offer an adequate premium for a change of control of the company. “Under the unsolicited proposal, the board believes AGL Energy shareholders would be forgoing the opportunity to realise potential future value via AGL Energy’s proposed demerger, as both proposed organisations pursue decisive action on decarbonisation.” Cannon-Brookes said the consortium was confident it could close and replace AGL’s coal plants – Bayswater in New South Wales and Loy Yang A in Victoria – by 2030, and take the company to net zero emissions by 2035. “We have $20bn to fund that transition,” he told the ABC’s RN Breakfast. He said it should lead to lower bills for consumers, create more jobs and substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions. AGL is responsible for more than 8% of Australia’s annual emissions - more in its own right than Sweden, Ireland or New Zealand, he said. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. Earlier this month, AGL brought forward the planned closure date of the Bayswater black coal plant in New South Wales to no later than 2033, and Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley to 2045. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025, rather than 2032. Cannon-Brookes, a renewable energy investor and vocal advocate for greater action on the climate crisis, reviously expressed an interest in backing clean energy assets to replace AGL’s ageing Liddell coal plant, which is due to shut next year. Brookfield last November secured approval from the foreign investment review board for the $17.8bn takeover of transmission group AusNet Services. Given AGL’s role as a major energy generator and retailer – before the planned demerger – the new bid may attract attention from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission if it were to be agreed.

2/21/2022,"All Sydney trains have been cancelled due to industrial action, leaving thousands unable to make their Monday morning commute. Workers have been warned to brace for a “very difficult” day by the Sydney Trains chief executive, Matt Longland.  “We’re urging customers to obviously avoid travel today or to use the transport journey planner to look for alternative options, such as buses, ferries and light rail if possible,” Longland told the radio station 2GB. Services will be disrupted across the city, including routes connecting Sydney to the Blue Mountains, the south coast and Newcastle. Buses will replace some services but commuters are being told to allow for extra travel time. Extra buses will be added to the network today, the Transport for New South Wales secretary, Rob Sharp, confirmed early on Monday morning. “We are doing everything possible to minimise the impact to commuters and sincerely apologise to everyone inconvenienced by this industrial action,” Sharp said. Services were cancelled about midnight last night after negotiations between the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and Transport for NSW broke down, following dozens of meetings. The parties appeared before the Fair Work Commission twice at the weekend before the state government decided it would be impossible to safely operate services due to planned union action. “We appeared before the Fair Work Commission twice over the weekend, including at 8pm last night, seeking a stop to this industrial action,” Sharp said. “These actions will impact hundreds of thousands of commuters and come at a time when people just want to get back to work, back to school and back to university – it’s not what our community needs at this time.” The RTBU NSW secretary, Alex Claassens, said the planned action – which would see workers only perform the actions they were set without any changes – would have only impacted management, not commuters. “Workers will be taking protected industrial action, but only transport management will notice the impact, not commuters,” Claassens said. “If commuters see any impact to their services, it won’t be because of workers’ actions, but because the NSW Government is spitting the dummy and trying to make a point. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There’s no strike – workers are simply performing the shifts we’re set without any changes.” Speaking at Central station on Monday morning, Claassens insisted workers were ready to go. “We are not on strike,” he said. “All the people sitting in the meal rooms, all across the network, are ready to work at a minute’s notice.” The union has been tense in negotiations with the government over a new enterprise agreement. “Our members have got a right to negotiate a fair enterprise agreement,” Classens said. “It’s not about money. It’s always been about safety issues, about protections against privatisation. It’s also about protections for the commuters, to make sure we maintain a safe and clean network.” The NSW employee relations minister, Damien Tudehope, told the ABC semantic disagreements about it being a strike or not wouldn’t make the day any easier for commuters. “We will continue to negotiate with the union with a view to trying to reach some sort of resolution,” he said. “We want the trains running. We want people back at work. “We’ve got international flights arriving in Sydney and people are arriving to union-inspired chaos.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, condemned the industrial action, accusing the union of making it hard or impossible for some essential workers this morning. “There are people this morning who are going to have an overpriced Uber or they’re going to be not able to get to work,” he told 2GB. “This is not how you treat your fellow citizens. “I feel for all of those Sydneysiders today who are affected by the strike.” The groups will be back before the Fair Work Commission later today.",News/Australia news,Sydney trains cancelled due to industrial action – but union insists workers aren’t on strike,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/21/sydney-trains-cancelled-due-to-industrial-action-with-warning-of-very-difficult-day-ahead
2/21/2022,"Australian campers, survivalists and reality TV fans are all in for a treat, with SBS announcing the launch of an Australian version of Alone, the international hit that sees contestants compete to survive the longest in remote locations. SBS announced the new show on Monday as part of their 2022 programming slate. The show will follow the format of the American original, in which 10 people spread out over challenging terrain, taking only 10 items with them from an approved list. Contestants are left to film themselves and are never told how many others are still in the game, until one person remains.  Casting for the first season opens on Monday, with a TV advertisement asking: “Do you have what it takes to protect yourself, feed yourself and stay alive in total isolation? Can you survive in the Australian wilderness alone?” SBS’s head of documentaries, Joseph Maxwell, said Alone was the most popular factual series on the channel’s streaming service, SBS On Demand, which now has more than 10 million registered users. “I’m slightly nervous how many applications will come in, due to [Alone’s] popularity,” Maxwell said. “It’s literally broken every record there is. We were aware that sitting on our shelf was this thing that was getting extraordinary engagement, so it made total sense to make an Australian version. “It’s been really exciting to start plotting – what would that look like, where would that be, how are we going to do it? It’s a terrifying show, it’s quite a scary idea.” Maxwell said SBS would be looking for contestants who could demonstrate advanced survival skills and an aptitude for filming, and who came from a range of cultural backgrounds, particularly Indigenous Australians. “There is no point someone going in there if they haven’t got the basic skills. You do need people with a certain resilience – the great thing is, you can’t predict that. And we really want to ensure cultural diversity, First Nations representation and also women as well,” he said. “I think [First Nations knowledge] is integral to the show. We’re always on First Nations land. And I think one of the things Alone has done quite usefully, with some of the First Nations Canadian stories, is effortlessly thread in that acknowledgment of the lands we’re on, that there might be certain customs or traditions that we’re able to inform people about.” A location for the show is yet to be finalised, but Maxwell said scouts were looking for cold locations to allow them to start filming in June, in Australia’s winter. The show will air in early 2023. “We’ve got some frontrunners,” he said. “You need to make sure there’s no line of sight [between camps], you need to make sure it’s a very large area. We are so lucky with Australia that we’ve got that space. We need to ensure that there’s no roads, there’s not little huts, do as much as we can to make sure they are fully isolated, day and night.” SBS could not confirm the prize money, but said it would be “life changing”. The original Alone, where the winner takes home US$500,000, has been syndicated around the world. Danish and Norwegian versions have launched as well. Monday’s announcement also confirmed the launch of a sixth free-to-air SBS channel, SBS WorldWatch, which will provide news in more than 35 languages, in May 2022. SBS said it will broadcast the Fifa World Cup in Qatar in November, and the first ever Tour de France Femmes – the much-awaited women’s Tour de France. Other shows announced included 200 more episodes of Adam Liaw’s The Cook Up, a new documentary on sexual consent hosted by Jess Hill called Yes, No, Maybe, and original drama Safe Home, from Offspring creator Imogen Banks, about a woman whose life gets turned upside down when she begins working at a women’s legal centre. SBS also confirmed the return of the Australia version of hit genealogy show Who Do You Think You Are?, with Matt Moran, Paula Duncan and Myf Warhurst among the celebrities exploring their family trees on the show’s 13th season.",Arts/Television & radio,Could you survive in the bush?

2/21/2022,"If there is one man England are keen to see back fit and singing the anthems at Twickenham, it is Manu Tuilagi. With the possible exception of Storm Eunice, few are better equipped to flatten anything in their path and the red-rose management are advising Wales to batten down the hatches when they head to Twickenham this weekend. With their opening-round defeat in Scotland having, in effect, left England needing to win all their remaining games to be title contenders, the news that Tuilagi is back fully fit and firing has been a tonic for the troops. Barring any mishaps in training this week, he is set to feature in a Six Nations fixture for the first time in 721 days.  His last championship appearance was against Wales nearly two years ago, when he scored a try and then collected a red card in a breathless 33-30 home win. Now, having proved his fitness for Sale Sharks following the hamstring injury he suffered while scoring his fine early try against the world champions, South Africa, in November, he has impressed the England management in training and poses a clear threat to Welsh ambitions. According to England’s defence coach, Anthony Seibold, the Tuilagi effect is significant whether or not England are in possession. “On both sides of the ball he’s a powerful weapon,” says Seibold, who is no stranger to big physical units from his time in Australian rugby league. “That’s been him for the last 11 years, carrying the ball. But just as important, if not more so, his contact around the defence is very good. “You saw the first couple of actions against Quins the other day. He played the last 30 minutes and his first two or three shots in contact were dominant ones. He brings a physical presence, there’s no doubt about that. He also brings a lot of experience and smarts in terms of what we’re trying to do.” If that makes the 30-year-old a “big in” from the management’s perspective, the centre’s experience and popularity are also valuable at a time when England are busily rebuilding. “He’s got that personality and character that people get a lot of confidence from,” says Seibold. “Manu is a real glue [player], there’s no doubt. He’s a really enjoyable guy to coach.” All that said, Tuilagi’s record against Wales is not as imposing as it might be. In five previous Six Nations encounters he has finished on the winning side only twice, with one of those coming as a replacement. He has never won in Cardiff in an England jersey and, including World Cup warm-ups, has registered two tries in eight fixtures. Those figures also reflect the long, injury-enforced gaps in Tuilagi’s career, which at one stage prevented him from starting a Test for England for almost five years. His value to England, even so, remains high as Eddie Jones seeks to find a straight-running accomplice for Marcus Smith to enhance England’s midfield balance. Elliot Daly and Joe Marchant have filled in alongside Henry Slade against Scotland and Italy respectively but England’s inability to kick on in the second half in Rome highlighted the fact they are a work in progress. “We know we need to improve, there is no doubt about that,” says Seibold. “We weren’t infatuated by the scoreboard or parts of the performance against Italy. To be the team we want to become, we need to be consistent. Regardless of where we play, that’s what we’re trying to drive.” Wasps’ Alfie Barbeary could yet be another forceful contributor during this tournament, with Seibold suggesting he is not in the squad simply to make up the numbers. “We wouldn’t have had Alfie at this camp if we didn’t see the potential for him to push into this squad,” said the Australian, who has been working on improving Barbeary’s defensive work-rate. “Once he improves that part of his game he is going to be one hell of a player. He is as good a ball carrier as we have in the group.” Seibold is looking forward to coming up against Wales, where he took his first coaching role with the Celtic Crusaders rugby league side in 2006. His middle daughter was born in Bridgend, and he used to live in the nearby village of Tondu. “My first coaching job was in Wales. I’d finished playing and was a schoolteacher back in Australia. The RFL was setting up a rugby league franchise in South Wales, so one of the Brisbane Broncos assistant coaches asked me to come out and start the team because I’d played over here for Hull KR and London Broncos. It was a good experience.” During his time in south Wales, Seibold also spent valuable hours with his former team-mate Shaun Edwards. “He was the Wales defence coach at the time, so I spent a bit of time observing their sessions back in 2008. Shaun invited me in on a number of occasions. Their performances over a long period of time, first with Warren Gatland and now with Wayne Pivac as their head coach, have been very consistent.” Now, with Tuilagi’s assistance, he is aiming to batter the nation he once called home.",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi braced to kick up a storm in England’s Wales showdown | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/20/manu-tuilagi-braced-to-kick-up-a-storm-in-englands-wales-showdown
