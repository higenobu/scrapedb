1/23/2022,"(Adds details, repercussions of dispute) By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) -Qatar Airways took a spiralling $4 million-a-day dispute with Europe's Airbus to social media on Friday, publishing a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKN0SpWeILo&feature=youtu.be of the scarred exterior of grounded A350 jets that the airline said underscored ""serious and legitimate safety concerns."" The two companies have been locked for months in a dispute over deterioration to paint and anti-lightning protection on the long-haul jets, which Airbus has acknowledged needs attention while insisting it does not put safety at risk. Qatar Airways hit back with the first official images of jets grounded by its national regulator in a bid to keep the spotlight on technical matters after Airbus accused the state-owned airline of engineering the dispute to obtain compensation. The dispute has led to the grounding of 21 planes out of 53 A350s operated by Qatar Airways and cast a pall over the airline's preparations for the World Cup later this year. The airline says it needs planes to accommodate thousands of fans. It has also prompted Qatar Airways to exclude Airbus from a multi-billion-dollar deal to replace almost three dozen freighters, which is expected to go to rival Boeing and could help bolster ties with Washington in an upcoming visit. Qatar Airways is pressing for compensation of $618 million plus $4 million a day and halted taking new A350 deliveries. Airbus has said it will fight the claim in full. In the video lasting just over a minute and a half released on YouTube, Qatar Airways showed rows of defects on the skin of some of the A350s grounded by the country's regulator. Airbus had no immediate comment on the video. Airbus has said there is ""no reasonable or rational basis"" for the groundings, which have not happened elsewhere. VIDEO EVIDENCE The clip showed areas of peeling or missing paint, cracks and damage to anti-lightning protection, as well as what the airline described as patches of carbon-fibre that were exposed to moisture and potentially damaging ultra-violet light. The lightweight carbon-fibre jetliner relies on metallic foil embedded beneath the paint to help lightning wash safely over the fuselage, which is less conductive than earlier metal. Lightning strikes jetliners about once a year. The video showed flakes of the copper-mesh anti-lightning system, which is supposed to be fixed to the plane with resin, coming loose when paint was teased away by a gloved hand. The images echoed damage to A350s first revealed in pictures exclusively https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/costly-airbus-paint-flaw-goes-wider-than-gulf-2021-11-29 published in a Reuters investigation last November. The investigation showed that at least five other airlines had reported A350 paint or skin flaws since 2016, well before Qatar raised concerns in November 2020 when an attempt to repaint a jet in World Cup livery exposed some 980 defects. ""We continue to strongly believe that Airbus must undertake a thorough investigation of this condition to conclusively establish its full root cause,"" Qatar Airways said. Airbus has said that it is looking at changing the design of anti-lightning mesh for future A350s, but insists there is adequate backup lightning protection. It says Qatar is undermining global protocols by seeking leverage over safety. The question of whether a ""root-cause analysis"" exists is part of a UK court case due for a hearing in late April. Airbus says it has provided the relevant information and concluded that there is no airworthiness risk, a view echoed by Europe's air regulator. The jet video capped 24 hours of intense exposure for the usually secretive aviation world after Airbus took the rare step of revoking a separate Qatar order for smaller A321neos. Qatar Airways indicated it would fight the move, saying it was upholding all its current contracts. The jet has been a major success for Airbus which faces problems in keeping up with demand. ""The opportunity cost to Airbus (of cancelling) is zero; it may even be convenient,"" said consultant Bertrand Grabowski.

1/23/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's new coalition government wants to attract 400,000 qualified workers from abroad each year to tackle both a demographic imbalance and labour shortages in key sectors that risk undermining the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.    ""The shortage of skilled workers has become so serious by now that it is dramatically slowing down our economy,"" Christian Duerr, parliamentary leader of the co-governing Free Democrats (FDP), told business magazine WirtschaftsWoche.    ""We can only get the problem of an ageing workforce under control with a modern immigration policy... We have to reach the mark of 400,000 skilled workers from abroad as quickly as possible,"" Duerr added.    Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, Duerr's libertarian FDP and the environmentalist Greens agreed in their coalition deal on measures like a points system for specialists from countries outside the European Union and lifting the national minimum wage to 12 euros ($13.60) per hour to make working in Germany more attractive.    The employer-friendly German Economic Institute estimates that the labour force will shrink by more than 300,000 people this year as there are more older workers retiring than younger ones entering the labour market.    This gap is expected to widen to more than 650,000 in 2029, leaving an accumulated shortage of people of working age in 2030 of roughly 5 million. The number of Germans in employment grew to nearly 45 million last year despite the coronavirus pandemic.    After decades of low birth rates and uneven migration, a shrinking labour force also poses a demographic time bomb for Germany's public pension system, in which fewer employees are burdened with the task of financing the pensions of a growing mass of retirees who are enjoying longer life expectancy.    (Reporting by Michael Nienaber, Editing by Victoria Waldersee and Toby Chopra) ",World/Reuters•yesterday,"Germany wants to attract 400,000 skilled workers from abroad each year",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/germany-wants-attract-400-000-050433498.html

1/23/2022,"It’s no secret that new markets, and new industries, offer investors superior return potential. It’s a function of an open field, one in which the high points have yet to be claimed and every move has a greater chance of landing in an advantageous position. One example of this phenomenon is the cannabis industry, and the vistas it has opened for enterprising stock investors. Cannabis isn’t new – but the legal regime is. Numerous states have been legalizing the plant and its extracts in past decade or more, and while the US has not passed national legalization, Canada has, as have several countries in Europe. The result is an expanding industry, as companies have grown up to take advantages of openings in growing, producing, marketing, and distributing cannabis and cannabis extracts to the medical and adult/recreational sectors. Taking a look at the US cannabis sector as a whole, Needham’s 5-star analyst Matt McGinley acknowledges the headwinds while foreseeing plenty of growth opportunities. On the debit side, the most obvious is the fragmented nature of the US cannabis market; without a national legal framework, the industry has to expand state-by-state. And this leads to the biggest credit for the industry, growth. McGinley points out that 37 states have a legalized medical industry, covering as much as 75% of the US population, while 18 states have legalized adult recreational use. McGinley believes that, in the next 2 years, 50% of the of the US population will live in areas with legal recreational use. “With growth expected across all state regulated programs, we expect US cannabis industry revenue to nearly double by 2026, which provides for a bright growth outlook for public and private operators in the space… In our view, these stocks are undervalued given prospects for exceptional growth that we foresee continuing for 5+ years'” McGinley explained. From an investor’s perspective, the chance to double your money is usually too good to ignore. We’ve used the TipRanks database to look up the details on two of McGinley’s picks, which he sees with better than 100% upside in the coming year. Each ticker has also received enough support from other Wall Street analysts to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Ayr Wellness (AYRWF) We’ll start with Ayr Wellness, a cannabis company in the health & wellness segment. Ayr produces a line of cannabis products, including smokable flowers, vapes, edibles, and beverages, which are sold through a network of dispensaries – 67 currently, with plans to expand to 95 by the end of this year. The company has over 557,000 square feed of cultivation space in its grow facilities, producing some 100,000 pounds of cannabis biomass. The company has been expanding its operations, and plans to increase its biomass production to near 300,000 pounds this year. Toward that end, in December, Ayr received approval to start developing a new 86,000 square foot cultivation facility in Arizona. On the retail end, Ayr opened its 43rd and 44th Florida dispensaries in recent weeks, and entered the Pennsylvania market with a dispensary in Bryn Mawr. Furthermore, during the third quarter, Ayr acquired the cannabis beverage company Levia, and entered a deal to acquire the Herbal Remedies dispensary chain; that deal is expected to close during the first quarter of this year. The active expansion reflects strong sales growth. Ayr saw the top line in 3Q21 (the most recent reported) grow by 111% year-over-year, to $96.2 million, and the company expects to see a 10% sequential gain in Q4. Needham’s McGinley selected Ayr as a Top Pick for this year, in part due to the company’s high growth potential. “Compared to MSO peers, we expect Ayr to have the highest revenue and EBITDA growth in '22, but the stock trades at the lowest EV/EBITDA multiple in the group. We attribute most of the disconnect between high growth and low valuation to assets under development that will become operational and revenue-generative in '22. While we see risk to revenue and EBITDA estimates related to timing and productivity ramps, we believe the multiple is low enough that it mitigates downside risk, and think will expand as assets become operational. As such, we see Ayr as one of the most compelling cannabis investments among MSOs, and rate this equity as our top pick for '22,"" McGinley wrote. In line with his optimistic approach, McGinley gives Ayr shares a Buy rating and his $35 price target suggests an impressive 120% potential upside for the coming year. (To watch McGinley’s track record, click here) Overall, the Strong Buy consensus rating shows that Wall Street is in agreement with the upbeat outlook here; the 5 recent reviews include 4 to Buy and only 1 Hold. Shares are selling for $16.84 and the $38.02 average price target suggests a one-year upside of ~140%. (See Ayr stock forecast on TipRanks) Curaleaf (CURLF) The next stock we’re looking at, Curaleaf, is one of the cannabis industry’s largest. Even after a year of share price losses – the stock is down 55% from last February’s peak – it still boasts a market cap of $5.5 billion. The company also has one of the industry’s widest distribution networks, with over 117 dispensaries in 23 states, supplied by 25 cultivation facilities with over 4.4 million square feet of grow capacity. Like Ayr, and the cannabis industry generally, Curaleaf has been growing rapidly. Just in December, the company announced four new dispensaries in Florida, an important move as Florida is the third-most populous state and a major market for legal medical cannabis. Curaleaf also acquired the Natural Remedy Patient Center in Arizona, a deal that cost $13 million and added a tenth location to the company’s network in that state. That was the prelude to Curaleaf’s acquisition of Arizona’s Bloom Dispensaries, a $211 million deal that added another 6 outlets to Curaleaf’s Arizona footprint. The Bloom deal also included over 63,000 square feet of cultivation and processing space in the Phoenix area. Curaleaf has seen explosive revenue growth over the past two years, with 8 consecutive quarters of top-line sequential gains. In the last quarter reported, 3Q21, the company hit $318.4 million in total revenue, for a 74% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations also grew substantially, to $52 million or 15% of total revenue. On a negative note, the company’s net loss deepened greatly, from 1 cent in Q2 to 8 cents in Q3. McGinley sees Curaleaf poised to further revenue growth going forward, on the back of its successful acquisition campaign. He says of the company: “With an operational footprint in 23 states, Curaleaf has the most breadth among MSOs and with scale building in states likely to express the most growth, we look for it to grow its topline and EBITDA on a multi-year basis. We expect tuck-in acquisitions like Tryke [a November acquisition move -ed.] and Bloom to be typical of the types of assets Curaleaf will pursue in '22.” McGinley reminds investors that there are considerable gains in store for Curaleaf in 2022. The analyst rates the stock a Buy, and his $17 price target implies an upside of ~120% on the one-year time horizon. All in all, this cannabis giant has picked up 11 analyst reviews in recent weeks, including 9 Buys to outweigh 2 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Shares in Curaleaf are trading for $7.74 and the $18.68 average price target implies ~141% upside from that level.

1/23/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pumped money into stocks and siphoned funds out of bonds and cash as global markets braced for higher interest rates, BofA's weekly flow show report showed on Friday. In the first 13 trading days of the year compared to the same period last year, equity funds have seen $52 billion of inflows compared to a similar amount last year while bond and credit funds have seen tiny outflows after heavy inflows, according to BofA using EPFR data. ""Rates up and profits down is a bad combo for credit and stocks and the Fed is hysterically behind the curve,"" analysts led by Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at the U.S. investment bank, said in a note. Money markets in the U.S. and the U.K are expecting as many as four rate hikes in 2022. On a weekly basis in stocks, emerging markets saw the biggest weekly inflows since March 2021 at $5.2 billion, China saw large inflows and U.S. equity funds saw the first outflows in four weeks. Cash levels were also building, although there was no risk-off sentiment in equity flows yet. BofA's 'private clients' -which manage $3.3 trillion of assets - had 11.3% in cash while the average beta of the top 10 stocks held by its clients was higher than historical averages, indicating they were more vulnerable to market volatility.
