2/11/2022,"Russia and Belarus have begun joint military exercises close to the Belarusian border with Ukraine, part of 10 days of drills seen as a significant element in the Kremlin‚Äôs menacing posture towards its neighbour. Up to 30,000 Russian troops, as well as almost all of the Belarusian armed forces, are taking part in the drills, which began on Thursday. They come at a time when Russia has also amassed forces along its own border with Ukraine, and in the annexed Crimean peninsula.  Much of the equipment for the drills has travelled thousands of miles across Russia. Russia‚Äôs defence ministry said one of its S-400 missile defence systems had been activated in Belarus close to the border with Ukraine. Although the Kremlin has said the Russian troops will return home after the drills, European leaders are watching warily. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, said: ‚ÄúThe accumulation of forces at the border is psychological pressure from our neighbours.‚Äù Ukraine has responded with 10 days of drills of its own. Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander of the Ukrainian land forces, said about 10,000 troops were involved in Ukraine‚Äôs exercises. ‚ÄúWe have specifically moved training of the armed forces towards the most dangerous lines of possible enemy offence,‚Äù he said on Wednesday. Ukraine‚Äôs defence minister has said the drills will feature Javelin anti-tank missiles, recently provided to Kyiv by the US, and British NLAW anti-tank weapons. Separately, Russia is preparing for missile tests in the Black Sea next week, manoeuvres that Ukraine says will make shipping impossible in both the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. On Thursday, Ukraine‚Äôs foreign ministry said the exercises showed ‚Äúblatant disregard for the rules and principles of international law‚Äù. As the tension around Ukraine has built up in recent weeks, US and British officials have sometimes sounded more alarmist about the threat of full-blown invasion than their Ukrainian counterparts, who say they believe Vladimir Putin‚Äôs ultimate goal is to exhaust Ukraine and provoke social unrest. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, who carried out a diplomatic mission to Moscow and Kyiv this week, said a way forward could be found through implementing the Minsk agreements, a 2015 ceasefire deal. Representatives of Russia, Ukraine, German and France met in the so-called ‚ÄúNormandy format‚Äù in Berlin on Thursday, in an attempt to find common ground on a plan for implementing the Minsk agreements, which foresee a political settlement for the regions of eastern Ukraine currently under the control of Russia-backed forces. Nevertheless, expectations are low that a real breakthrough is possible, given Moscow appears to want a deal that would give it a say in Ukraine‚Äôs foreign policy, which is likely to be a non-starter in Kyiv.",News/World news,Russia and Belarus begin military drills near Belarusian border with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/10/russia-belarus-military-drills-near-belarusian-border-ukraine
2/11/2022,"With the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, resigning from her post after a series of scandals, the chance to lead Britain‚Äôs biggest police force has come up much sooner than expected. Here are some of the most likely candidates to take over a beleaguered Scotland Yard.  The chair of the National Police Chiefs‚Äô Council and a former senior Met officer who joined policing from the armed forces. Some in the Conservative party are keen on the idea of policing taking in more people with military backgrounds. He has also spent plenty of time with ministers during the pandemic, which could be a plus or a minus. Until recently, the assistant commissioner was the head of counter-terrorism.

He is widely seen as capable, and is mostly well thought of, but irked No 10, who believe his criticism in a Guardian interview of Boris Johnson‚Äôs previous comments on race were harsh. He is also a strong candidate to be the next head of the National Crime Agency, but the Met is his first love. If the home secretary wants reform, would a Met lifer be the choice ‚Äì and if so, can Johnson forgive him? The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), also a former Met assistant commissioner, could be the shock and awe candidate for the job. He is feared by some in the rank and file, and more so by middle ranks. He has come with an acerbic reputation from the past, but friends insist he has mellowed, and his experience in the PSNI may have stood him in good stead for the complexity of the Met. He would promise reform, which could descend into rancour. Another assistant commissioner in the Met, and currently acting head of counter-terrorism. Unlike Dick, who had never run her own force before the Met, Jukes was the chief of South Wales police, covering a busy and demanding patch. A leader and specialist on tackling violence against women, the Met assistant commissioner came from being deputy in the West Midlands, and is highly regarded within policing. The chief of West Midlands police is standing down this year. He is a strong candidate, but has expressed reluctance to take it on and may prefer being chief of the policing inspectorate instead.

2/11/2022,"People who develop Alzheimer‚Äôs disease can experience sleep disturbances years before the condition takes hold, but whether one causes the other, or something more complex is afoot, has always proved hard for scientists to determine. Now, researchers in the US have shed light on the mystery, in work that raises hopes for new therapies, and how ‚Äúgood sleep hygiene‚Äù could help to tackle the disease and its symptoms.  The findings show that humans‚Äô 24-hour circadian clock controls the brain‚Äôs ability to mop up wayward proteins linked to Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. If the scientists are right, the work would explain, at least in part, how disruption to circadian rhythms and sleep disturbances might feed into the onset and progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, and how preventing such disruption might stave off the condition. ‚ÄúCircadian disruption is correlated with Alzheimer‚Äôs diagnosis and it has been suggested that sleep disruptions could be an early warning sign of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease,‚Äù said Dr Jennifer Hurley, who led the research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in New York. Alzheimer‚Äôs takes hold when connections are lost between nerve cells in the brain. The disease is progressive and linked to abnormal plaques and tangles of proteins that steadily build up in the brain. The disease is the most common cause of dementia and affects more than half a million people in the UK, a figure that is set to rise. To keep the brain healthy, immune cells called microglia seek out and destroy troublesome proteins that threaten to accumulate in the brain. One type of protein targeted by the cells is called amyloid beta, a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs. Writing in the journal Plos Genetics, Hurley and her team describe how they found a daily rhythm in microglia which drove regular waves of protein-clearing. When the cells lost their circadian rhythm, the clearing routine faltered. ‚ÄúThe disruption of the proper timing of amyloid beta clearance could be one of the reasons we see an increase in plaques that form in the brain during Alzheimer‚Äôs disease,‚Äù Hurley said. While sleep disturbances often arise before Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, Hurley and many other scientists suspect there is a complex interplay between the two. Disrupting sleep and circadian rhythms allowed amyloid beta to build up, Hurley said, but this in turn damaged brain cells that ran the circadian clock, causing further accumulation of amyloid beta. ‚ÄúWe have known for a while that there is a rhythm in the clearance of amyloid beta in the brain,‚Äù Hurley said. ‚ÄúAs we age, and more so in Alzheimer‚Äôs patients, this rhythm disappears. This loss could lead to the increase of amyloid beta in the brain.‚Äù But the findings point to therapies that could potentially reduce the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs or lessen the severity of the symptoms. Hurley said it may be possible to stimulate the brain‚Äôs ability to clear out amyloid beta with simple interventions, such as exposure to light, or via more sophisticated therapies that boost the activity of the immune cells. ‚ÄúTaking care of our sleep or circadian rhythms ‚Äì sometimes called good sleep hygiene ‚Äì may be able to reduce amyloid beta burden over our lifespan,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúReducing amyloid burden could mean a reduction in Alzheimer‚Äôs symptoms or a delay in the onset or progression of the disease.‚Äù",News/Society,Study finds link between Alzheimer‚Äôs and circadian clock,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/10/study-finds-link-between-alzheimers-and-circadian-clock
2/11/2022,"Dame Cressida Dick is to stand down as commissioner of the Metropolitan police after a series of scandals. The decision follows a public falling out with the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who put her ‚Äúon notice‚Äù that she had to rapidly reform the Met or lose his confidence in her leadership.  Dick has led Britain‚Äôs biggest police force since 2017 and her five-year term as commissioner ‚Äãwas ‚Äãdue to end in April this year . Her contract was extended by two years to 2024 only last September‚Äã by the home secretary, Priti Patel, which Khan endorsed. Khan‚Äôs confidence in Dick was shaken by a scandal at Charing Cross police station where officers shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages. The London mayor was angered because of the 14 officers investigated, nine remain in the Met‚Äã. Furthermore, two were promoted from constable to sergeant, one of whom had attended a misconduct meeting. After details of the sickening messages ‚Äì including remarks about the deaths of African babies ‚Äì were made public, the mayor called Dick to a meeting where 90 minutes of discussions left him unsatisfied. The Met commissioner is picked by the home secretary who has to have due regard for the views of London‚Äôs mayor, who is also the police and crime commissioner for London. Government sources made it clear that if Khan declared he had lost confidence in Dick, she would be expected to stand down and ministers would not try to save her. The souring of relations with Khan to the point where they became terminal came after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) revealed shocking details of messages shared by Met officers between 2016 ‚Äì the year before Dick became commissioner ‚Äì and 2018. They were uncovered by accident. One male officer wrote to a female officer: ‚ÄúI would happily rape you ‚Ä¶ if I was single I would happily chloroform you.‚Äù The IOPC said the behaviour was part of an offensive Met police culture, not just rogue individuals: ‚ÄúWe believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‚Äòbad apples‚Äô.‚Äù The Met had continued to deny the force was plagued by misogyny and racism. Dick was the first female to be made leader of the Met since it was founded in 1829. A series of scandals that raised questions about the police‚Äôs treatment of women also helped diminish Dick‚Äôs commissionership. The Met leadership‚Äôs handling of the murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021 by a serving Met officer also caused consternation in City Hall and government. After her killer was sentenced to a whole-life term in September 2021, the Met leadership was expected to show it understood the concerns. Instead it was mocked after saying that women who were worried about an officer approaching them could wave down a bus. The Met announced its own inquiry, as have the government. Dick was also personally criticised for the obstruction of an official inquiry into police corruption. The panel investigating the 1987 unsolved murder of Daniel Morgan lambasted Dick and labelled the Met as ‚Äúinstitutionally corrupt‚Äù, which Dick denies. A big expansion of stop and search resulted in falling African-Caribbean confidence in policing, and confidence generally in the Met fell dramatically during Dick‚Äôs term in office. Highly intelligent and hard working, Dick, who earned a ¬£230,000 salary, was said to have the demeanour of a civil service permanent secretary rather than a stereotypical police officer.",News/UK news,Dame Cressida Dick to stand down as Met police commissioner,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/dame-cressida-dick-to-stand-down-as-met-police-commissioner
2/11/2022,"A Cornish beachside hotel that built nine meeting rooms without planning permission claiming they were needed for the G7 summit has been ordered to demolish them because they have caused ‚Äúvery significant harm‚Äù to the landscape. The Carbis Bay hotel built the rooms in three single-storey buildings before hosting last summer‚Äôs meeting of world leaders. It said it had pressed ahead without planning permission because of the urgency of the project.  The development led to protest marches on the beach with objectors pointing out that precious habitats and views had been ruined. There was also anger that the hotel claimed the rooms were needed to provide space to host bilateral G7 talks when the UK government said it had not asked for extra work to be carried out. The planning inspector Peter Jarratt highlighted objectors‚Äô argument that the development ‚Äúflew in the face‚Äù of the G7‚Äôs claimed green credentials. He said: ‚ÄúThere has been a significant public response to the unauthorised development and to the submitted retrospective planning application for reasons including the inappropriateness of the development and to the failure of the applicant to follow the due planning process.

2/11/2022,"Approximately 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis, an expressionist painting has been returned to the descendants of a German-Jewish couple by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Brussels. Flowers, a 1913 still life by the German artist Lovis Corinth, was entrusted to the museums in 1951, because postwar investigators were unable to trace the original owners.  After years of research, the painting has been returned, the first restitution of any artwork looted from a Jewish family in the second world war by the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, which covers six museums, with works spanning the old masters to Magritte. Thomas Dermine, Belgium‚Äôs secretary of state in charge of museums, handed the work to a lawyer representing the nine great-grandchildren of Gustav and Emma Mayer, a German-Jewish couple who fled Germany in 1938. ‚ÄúThis restitution, the first by the Museums of Fine Arts, is a very strong signal: even decades later, justice can triumph,‚Äù Dermine said. The return of the painting was also ‚Äúan opportunity to remind people of the horrors‚Äù to which nationalism and the far right could lead, he said. ‚ÄúTo repair is to remember and to remember is to avoid the return of the worst.‚Äù The Mayers ran a successful business in Frankfurt before fleeing the Nazi persecution. They owned 30 paintings, which were left in storage in Brussels after a 14-month stay in the Belgian capital from 1938-39. Flowers is the only one to have been recovered. Lawyers for the family approached the museums in 2016, eight years after it launched an online database about 27 works of uncertain provenance in the collections as part of an effort to find owners. Imke Gielen, a lawyer with the Berlin firm Von Trott, who is acting for the Mayers‚Äô descendants, said it was a historic day for the family. ‚ÄúThey are delighted that at least one of the missing paintings has been identified after 80 years and has now been returned.‚Äù The nine descendants, who live in the UK, South Africa and US, have yet to decide what to do with the painting, she said, adding: ‚ÄúToday is the day of restitution which we celebrate and other things will come in the next few days. The family has to decide.‚Äù Gustav and Emma Mayer arrived in Brussels in June 1938, after fleeing through Italy and Switzerland. In August 1939, days before the outbreak of war, they made it to Britain and settled in Bournemouth. Their eldest son, Ernst, was interned with other German-Jewish refugees as an ‚Äúenemy alien‚Äù on the Isle of Mann. Gustav Mayer, in poor health when he left Germany, died in his mid-80s in 1940 of natural causes, although his death may have been hastened by the trauma of persecution and the difficult journey. His wife Emma died in 1944. They never saw their paintings again. In 1942 a few works from the Mayer collection disappeared when the Nazi special taskforce led by Hitler‚Äôs acolyte, Alfred Rosenberg, began its work of plundering cultural treasures that belonged to European Jews. By 1943 all the Mayer property in Brussels had been stolen. One highlight of the collection was a painting of a horseman on the beach by Max Liebermann, one of the leading impressionists in Germany. There were also other works by Corinth, as well as lesser-known Frankfurt artists. Michel Draguet, the museum‚Äôs director, said he felt no sadness that the work would leave the museum, where it had been on display in the modern art collection. ‚ÄúWe never bought this painting, we were never the owners, we were the custodians for the Belgian state.‚Äù He and all his staff felt they were fulfilling the museum‚Äôs role in society, he said. Draguet had scored out the painting from the museum‚Äôs inventory, a brown foolscap A4-sized book, with the word ‚Äúregister‚Äù printed in French and Dutch on the front. The handover ceremony took place in a new exhibition room showing other works given to the museum in 1951, when Belgium‚Äôs postwar Economic Recovery Service, the body in charge of restitution of missing art, was disbanded. The owners of the original works, a mix of old masters and 19th-century landscapes, have either never been identified or there are questions about how they were acquired. One work by the 17th-century Bavarian artist Hans Rottenhammer, Diana and Callisto, was bought by a curator employed by Hermann G√∂ring in 1941 from a Brussels art collector. Nothing of the work‚Äôs ownership before 1941 is known, raising questions about a possible forced sale. The Mayers‚Äô descendants repaid the German government the ‚Äúsmall compensation‚Äù award they had received in the 1970s for the loss of Flowers, Gielen, their lawyer, said. Meanwhile, aided by researchers, the family continue to search for the 29 missing paintings, which are registered on the German government database, lostart.de. For now, there are no leads. ‚ÄúWe have no images; we have descriptions, not all of them are very detailed so unfortunately,‚Äù Gielen said. ‚ÄúNone of the other works has been identified yet.‚Äù",News/World news,‚ÄòJustice can triumph‚Äô: painting looted by Nazis returned to owners after 80 years ,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/10/justice-can-triumph-painting-looted-by-nazis-returned-to-owners-after-80-years
2/11/2022,"Such events are normally arranged weeks in advance, so it is unlikely that Sir John Major decided to make his speech about the decline of trust in British democracy on Thursday specifically to coincide with Boris Johnson and Liz Truss‚Äôs Ukraine-related diplomatic forays to Brussels, Warsaw and Moscow. The split-screen counterpoint between the two events was nevertheless very striking. In particular, it was revealing about the realities, and the fantasies, of this government‚Äôs international influence. On the one hand, in Moscow, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, contemptuously derided his meeting with Ms Truss as a conversation of ‚Äúthe mute with the deaf‚Äù, containing ‚Äúnothing secret, no trust. Just slogans‚Ä¶‚Äù On the other hand, in London, Sir John was simultaneously delivering a passionate warning that a loss of political trust at home leads umbilically to a loss of political reputation and influence abroad. The connection between the two could hardly have been more clearly illustrated.  The efforts by the UK prime minister and foreign secretary to play a role with others to prevent Russia from attacking Ukraine are welcome. Peace, freedom and stability in eastern Europe are profoundly in the interests of all European nations, including Britain. Our security rests upon it. It was also inevitable, in the wake of lawless acts like the state-sponsored killing in London of Alexander Litvinenko and of the Salisbury poisonings, that Mr Lavrov would adopt an aggressively condescending approach to Britain. There was and is no justification for that. Yet at the same time, as Sir John observed, Britain has arrived late at the table. It was not the British prime minister who flew to Moscow and spent several hours talking to Vladimir Putin last week. It was the French president. As Sir John wistfully put it: ‚ÄúThat would have been us in years gone by.‚Äù Perhaps it would have been, although postwar France has a long history of casting itself as a pragmatic interlocutor with Russia. The reality is that there are downsides as well as upsides to the wish of post-imperial powers to play mediating roles. The important point, however, is that Britain today is not remotely close to playing the influential role that its self-important ‚Äúglobal Britain‚Äù rhetoric implies. Sir John was on strongest ground in his forthright denunciation of the Johnson government‚Äôs carefree approach to truth, laws and standards in public life ‚Äì and its indifference to the international consequences. He was explicit that No 10 has broken lockdown laws and then issued false and misleading denials. He was also unambiguous, during questions, that Mr Johnson should resign if he is found to have broken the law. This is potentially a hugely important issue that could become a fault line in the Tory party. No 10 has again briefed this week that Mr Johnson would not resign. But No 10 is wrong, and Sir John is right. He is also right that lack of trust at home has consequences abroad. This is not well enough understood here, where there remains much complacency about the way Britain is seen. The combination of the Brexit vote and Mr Johnson‚Äôs election as prime minister shook international confidence ‚Äì not just European confidence. This is still being compounded by the UK‚Äôs casual approach to the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol in particular. It would be shaken much further and more destructively if the Johnson government breaches the agreement and abandons the Northern Ireland deal. Mistrust towards Britain is not caused by Brexit alone. It has a longer history. But it is encouraged by Mr Johnson himself, at home and abroad. Britain still often enjoys, sometimes in defiance of the facts, a good international reputation as a stable, fair and rational nation. It is a reputation worth nurturing and worth deserving. Mr Johnson is a real and present threat to that. According to Sir John, ‚Äúour reputation is being shredded‚Äù.

2/11/2022,"Windfall taxes are nothing new. Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs government was one of the most notable users of the tactic ‚Äì with one-off levies on banks and oil companies for making excess gains in the early 1980s. Perhaps the fact that such duties find favour with the public surprises some who think economic populism is pass√©. But with gas prices trebling and the bosses of fossil fuel companies proclaiming ‚Äúcash machine‚Äù profits, surely Labour‚Äôs Ed Miliband is right to call for a one-off increase in corporation tax on North Sea producers to fund lower bills for consumers. Big oil‚Äôs claim that it is paying its fair share to the Treasury is not credible, given that handouts from the state have often actually exceeded the tax take that the industry generates. Between 2018 and 2020, Shell and BP, which together produce more than 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, paid no corporation tax or production levies on North Sea oil operations and claimed tax reliefs of nearly ¬£400m.  Such firms say cash is needed to transition away from fossil fuels. Yet since 2016, BP has spent just $3bn (¬£2.2bn) on clean energy investment, against a whopping $84bn on oil and gas exploration and development. Some critics of windfall taxes argue that reducing profits would hurt pensioners whose payouts depend on dividends from big businesses. Mathew Lawrence of the Common Wealth thinktank says this is no longer true. He points out that the proportion of UK shares directly held by UK pension funds fell from almost one in three in 1990 to fewer than one in 25 by 2018. A windfall tax is not part of Rishi Sunak‚Äôs plans, but he could embrace it before his spring statement on 23 March. Unfortunately, the chancellor seems more intent on currying favour with climate sceptic Tory MPs. Reports say Mr Sunak is pushing for more North Sea oil and gas fields to be given the green light. Producing more hydrocarbons at home doesn‚Äôt increase our domestic energy security because the product is exported to international markets. One answer would be to nationalise production ‚Äì but Tory MPs are unlikely to welcome such a policy. Britons are alarmed by global heating. Yet Conservative politicians jockeying to take over from Boris Johnson have a different electorate in mind: the elderly, rightwing Tory membership. Mr Johnson‚Äôs would-be successors should not sacrifice net zero targets meant to stave off planetary collapse for personal advancement. Many people appear to think companies are using the energy crunch to charge exorbitant prices and gouge earnings. To protect consumers, politicians should crack down on profiteers. To protect the planet, they should transition the economy away from carbon-based energy in favour of green substitutes. Both policies could be combined if firms were forced to pay for frying the planet.

Now that extends to their romantic lives, as Tinder has introduced a blind date feature to boost its popularity among young people ‚Äì by enabling them to meet partners in a way that resembles the pre-smartphone era.The new feature on the dating app matches people based on preferences, and enables them to make conversation before they are allowed to view each other‚Äôs photos. It will shortly be available in the US before being expanded globally.  Tinder says the feature is intended to respond to demands from generation Z, usually defined as people born between 1997 and 2012, for more authentic connections as a backlash to online dating‚Äôs earlier emphasis on superficial judgments based on preened Instagram-ready photos on dating profiles. A survey of 1,000 18-24-year-olds in the UK commissioned by the app found that a fifth said they would like to try blind dating as it would enable them to meet people they might otherwise have overlooked.Tinder said: ‚ÄúInspired by the OG way to meet someone new, usually at the hand of a meddlesome aunt or well-meaning friend, blind date gives the daters of today a low-pressure way to put their personality first and find a match they truly vibe with. ‚ÄúThe experience reflects the modern dating habits of gen Z, who value authenticity, and also taps into their 90s nostalgia with a callback to dating in a pre-smartphone world.‚ÄùThe company said its early testing suggested that members who used the blind date feature made 40% more matches than when their profiles were visible. The blind date feature functions by asking users to complete a series of icebreaker-style questions, and then pairing them with others based on similar responses. Users then enter a timed chat in which they only receive these answers as prompts, including responses to questions such as ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to wear a shirt ____ times without washing it‚Äù and ‚ÄúI put ketchup on____‚Äù. When the timer runs out, users can like the other person‚Äôs profile, and if there‚Äôs a match they can see photos and continue chatting. Blind date is part of a new suite of interactive games on Tinder named Explore, which is targeted at gen Z consumers and with an interface that has been likened to TikTok. These include swipe night, a choose-your-own-adventure game, and hot takes, where users discuss controversial opinions. Tinder first launched on a US college campus in 2012, and was initially met with some suspicion.

Forbes, which published its first issue in 1917, is renowned for its billionaires list, whose constituents include the Binance chief executive and founder, Changpeng Zhao, whose wealth is estimated at $1.9bn by the magazine. Zhao said: ‚ÄúAs Web3 and blockchain technologies move forward and the crypto market comes of age we know that media is an essential element to build widespread consumer understanding and education. We look forward to bolstering Forbes‚Äôs digital initiatives as they evolve into a next-level investment insights platform.‚Äù Mike Federle, the chief executive of Forbes, said the publisher could become a ‚Äútrue leader‚Äù in information on digital assets. ‚ÄúForbes is committed to demystifying the complexities and providing helpful information about blockchain technologies and all emerging digital assets,‚Äù he said. Two senior Binance executives ‚Äì chief communications officer Patrick Hillmann and Bill Chin, the head of its venture capital arm ‚Äì will join the Forbes board of directors on the closing of the deal. A Binance spokesperson said: ‚ÄúI can confirm Forbes‚Äôs editorial independence will remain sacrosanct, and entirely independent from Binance.‚Äù",News/Technology,Crypto exchange Binance makes $200m investment in Forbes,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/10/crypto-exchange-binance-makes-200m-investment-in-forbes
2/11/2022,"As MPs wheeled their suitcases on to trains for a short recess, those with lingering doubts about Boris Johnson‚Äôs leadership tucked their letter-writing pens back into their pockets. They seem unlikely to come out again until the Metropolitan police determine whether the prime minister committed any criminal offence by attending a number of Downing Street gatherings.  There have certainly been new errors and developments that have agitated MPs ‚Äì the protesters shouting Jimmy Savile jibes at Keir Starmer, the promotion of the chief whip, Mark Spencer, who upset many with his conduct, and the revelation that the Met will ask more than 50 people, including Johnson, to give a formal legal response to their inquiries. ‚ÄúThe reshuffle is transparently all about preparing for the Met inquiry,‚Äù one MP said. ‚ÄúThe whole focus of governing the United Kingdom has been trained on keeping Boris Johnson in No 10.‚Äù But none of the recent developments have been the fatal tipping point that could lead to the 54 letters that would need to be submitted to the 1922 Committee to trigger a vote of no confidence. Graham Brady, the chairman of the committee of Conservative backbenchers, has told MPs he will not trigger any vote over recess, or even count the letters again until the House returns in 10 days. ‚ÄúThe letters have dried up,‚Äù said one MP, who has been critical of Johnson. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of any new ones.‚Äù A promised move to improve engagement between Tory backbenchers and the government made progress on Thursday, with the announcement that 15 policy committees mirroring Whitehall departments would be created. Brady said they would work as a ‚Äúsounding board‚Äù for new ideas, meaning it would be ‚Äúless likely that colleagues will find themselves asked to defend the indefensible‚Äù. Exc: Graham Brady is cracking on with forming Tory backbench policy committees to improve engagement between MPs.15 committed will be set up, with nominations opening today and ballot on 1 March. Posts will last one year and be a ""sounding board"" for new policies. pic.twitter.com/FxbKUrNHRK The move was met with a groan by some Tory MPs, however, who complained the committees would only be effective if Johnson and senior ministers heeded any of their recommendations. In his one-to-one meetings with MPs, Johnson has been asking them to give him time to turn things around, to demonstrate a renewed sense of purpose and a beefed-up operation. Though some described the prime minister‚Äôs attitude in the meetings as arrogant, most said he had been attentive and agreeable, even when they had laid into him in righteous anger. Some have been given even more special treatment: a prime ministerial visit. The launch of the levelling up white paper and the elective recovery plan saw Johnson take a whistle-stop tour of constituencies through Tory held-seats in Essex, north-west England and north Wales. MPs who had privately voiced doubts to Johnson about whether he had become an electoral liability ‚Äì as well as those who had been demonstrably loyal ‚Äì were shown in person how he could still pose for selfies and engage even the most disgruntled swing voter. ‚ÄúHe was on top Boris form ‚Äì relaxed, jovial but engaging,‚Äù one MP said, describing how Johnson had been stopped for pictures by everyone on the visit. At one event, an attendee had left his own wedding to meet the prime minister, who spoke to his bride on the phone. ‚ÄúI know it impressed some colleagues,‚Äù another neighbouring MP said. ‚ÄúIt may have had the intended effect.‚Äù But another said it was ‚Äúsuch an obvious set-up that I don‚Äôt know how they could believe it‚Äù. MPs also said they had been observing various leadership contenders and found them wanting. ‚ÄúThey have been throughly unimpressive,‚Äù one said. ‚Äú[Rishi] Sunak is showing his naivety, Liz [Truss] is a terrible prospect, and others, like [Tom] Tugendhat and [Mark] Harper, are being too obvious.‚Äù Johnson has also been granted a reprieve, in part, because others have been telling colleagues to hold fire ‚Äì veteran MPs who believe that to go off half-cocked would result in the prime minister winning a bruising no-confidence vote. ‚ÄúIt is essential that colleagues wait,‚Äù one former frontbencher said. ‚ÄúWe cannot have it happen where he is able to mount any plausible defence.‚Äù One former cabinet minister who has been publicly supportive of Johnson said the prime minister‚Äôs position would be untenable if he was fined: ‚ÄúI think then, things are different.‚Äù Another MP said the Tories would be laughed at if they ever tried to call themselves the party of law and order. ‚ÄúPeople will look back and say: ‚ÄòWhy did we ever allow ourselves to have these lockdowns imposed when the people writing the rules never took them seriously?‚Äô I think that has big implications for our democracy, never mind Boris Johnson.‚Äù",News/Politics,Has Boris Johnson done enough to avoid a no-confidence vote?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/10/has-boris-johnson-done-enough-to-avoid-a-no-confidence-vote
