1/16/2022,"The headline polling figures are bad enough for Boris Johnson. Labour has a 10-point lead and the prime minister’s popularity is now at the same point as Theresa May’s at her lowest. But digging beneath the surface, the latest Opinium poll for the Observer reveals a deeper and more serious problem: Johnson’s coalition of traditional Tories and pro-Brexit working-class voters is fracturing.  The poll shows that 46% of Leave voters who voted Conservative in 2019 believe Johnson should resign, compared with 39% who want him to stay. These people are the core of the prime minister’s base and if they desert him, he is sunk. Johnson’s 2019 general election win was the result of his appeal to working-class Leave voters in the so-called “red wall” northern seats, while retaining many Remain-voting Tories in the party’s traditional middle-class base. Since then, some of the socially liberal, well-off voters charmed by David Cameron have been put off by Johnson’s behaviour in government, enabling a Liberal Democrat resurgence in the North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham byelections last year. With a working majority of 77, the Conservatives can afford to lose some of those supporters if it keeps the rest of its voter coalition together. But losing the people who wanted to “get Brexit done” would be catastrophic, and the poll will confirm the anxieties of Tory MPs seeing their inboxes fill up with messages from angry constituents who do not normally contact them. The poll shows that 48% of all 2019 Conservative voters say he should resign as party leader. Even 30% of those who would vote Tory now believe he should go. Labour are now in their biggest lead position since 2014, 10 points ahead at 41%. “Today’s poll adds to growing evidence that the ‘partygate’ scandal is jeopardising the party’s support from red wall Leavers too,” said Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester. “Such voters have long felt disaffected from, and distrustful of, a political class they felt ignored their concerns and lived by its own rules. The resentments once mobilised against the EU by the promise to ‘take back control’ now have a new target – an out-of-touch Downing Street team who partied while the Queen mourned.” Opinium found 76% of respondents think Johnson broke lockdown rules, with 8% saying he did not. Only 13% think he is telling the truth, against 64% who do not. Sixty-seven per cent say the police should investigate. Johnson appears to hope that by asking people to wait a week or so more until civil servant Sue Gray’s report, he may be able to ride out the storm. Yet people appear to have made up their minds already – asked if Johnson should resign if it turns out he broke lockdown rules, 67% say yes. But 63% of UK adults simply believe he should step down, compared with 22% who say he should remain as leader of the Conservative party. Yesterday, the ConservativeHome website reported that 53% of its panel of party members believed Johnson should quit. The site’s editor, Paul Goodman, said this was lower than the 71% who wanted Theresa May to go in 2019. “Nevertheless, that over half of party members want the prime minister out, if this return is representative, is a humiliating result for him, and shows a loss of confidence that may not be reversed,” Goodman wrote. Among general voters, Johnson’s net approval is the same as May’s before the 2019 European elections that heralded her resignation, according to Opinium. The prime minister now has a net -42% approval rating (22% approve and 64% disapprove). Labour leader Keir Starmer remains stable at a +4% net rating (36% v 32%) and is the preferred prime minister of 30%, compared with 21% for Johnson. “Johnson has shifted from the party’s biggest asset, with a Brexit-fuelled appeal separate to the Conservative brand, to its biggest liability,” Ford said. “The Conservatives may now be damned if they do and damned if they don’t.” Of Johnson’s potential Conservative successors, Rishi Sunak is viewed most positively – 45% say he would make a good PM with 32% against. The other widely tipped candidate, Liz Truss, has the support of 22% with 38% against. In the rest of the field, Sajid Javid is best placed (30% for v 44% against), ahead of Jeremy Hunt (26% v 43%), Michael Gove (24% v 53%) and Priti Patel (20% v 61%). “Sticking with Johnson risks further contaminating the party brand if the scandals continue and voter fury intensifies,” Ford added. “Party veterans with memories of the 1990s will recall how hard renewal can become once their party is toxic. Yet replacing Johnson brings its own risks, as none of the frontrunners for the succession looks likely to replicate his unique appeal with voters otherwise suspicious of the Conservatives.” Unlike 2015 and 2019, when the Conservatives recruited nationalist Eurosceptic voters from Nigel Farage, there was now no Ukip or Brexit party to squeeze, Ford added. “Keir Starmer’s personal ratings, though mediocre, are better than his predecessor and improving. The Conservatives’ hopes may now rest on whether voters’ longstanding reservations about Labour outweigh their growing anger at a prime minister now widely seen as a liar and a law breaker unfit for office.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s red wall crumbles as Leave voters call for him to resign,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/16/boris-johnsons-red-wall-crumbles-as-leave-voters-call-for-him-to-resign
1/16/2022,"Oil and gas companies have handed shareholders almost £200bn since 2010 and should be hit with a windfall tax to cap heating bills that are set to rise by as much as £500 a year, according to a report on the finances of the UK’s energy sector. Shell and BP are among companies that have seen their profits boosted in the last year as wholesale gas prices rose by as much as nine times and petrol prices jumped to record highs, leading to calls for them to help limit a £20bn bill faced by UK households.  A report for the left-of-centre thinktank Common Wealth found that Shell and BP channelled £147bn to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks over the past decade, with North Sea producers and the big six energy suppliers contributing another £47bn. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs last September the government was considering a plan for a £2.6bn windfall tax on generators and energy traders that stood to gain from the energy crisis. It is understood Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is still considering measures to limit rising bills, including a windfall tax, but with two weeks until the regulator, Ofgem, announces how much a cap on energy bills will rise in April, he has yet to settle on a final package. The chancellor, accused of being “missing in action” while energy costs soar, is under pressure from Tory MPs to cut state spending and reduce Britain’s debts. He is known to favour a loan scheme for energy suppliers, giving them the funds to cushion the blow this year, with the addition of a small subsidy to the poorest households using the Warm Home Discount Scheme. Several prominent energy bosses are known to have promoted a loan scheme as the best way to limit rising bills in a series of meetings at the Treasury last week. However, gas prices could remain high for several years, increasing the size of the energy sector’s debts and forcing suppliers to keep household bills up for the rest of the decade, while they make repayments. Ofgem is expected to announce on 5 February how much bills will increase in the next financial year. About 30 energy suppliers have gone bust in the last year, blaming the energy price cap for their fall into bankruptcy. Most rich nation governments have already put in place financial support, including a €4.5bn subsidy by the Italian government to limit bill increases. Ministers in Paris said last week they will force EDF, the 80% state-owned energy giant, to take an €8.4bn (£7bn) financial hit to protect households in a move that will limit energy bill increases to 4% this year. The Biden administration has ramped up grant payments for poorer US households to cover the rising cost of gas, while in Germany, the government has slashed a surcharge on bills used to support renewable energy schemes, which will instead receive extra state subsidies drawn from higher carbon taxes.Labour said it was fair that the oil and gas producers benefiting most from the energy crisis ‘“play their part in helping families through the cost of living crisis”. Ed Miliband, the shadow secretary of state of climate change and net zero, said: “When the head of BP describes the crisis as a ‘cash machine’ for his company and fossil-fuel producers pay out billions in share buybacks, it is a clear indication of the scale of windfall profits they are making.” Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation, said a windfall tax should be part of the package of measures that included subsidies for poorer households. “It must be sensible for those companies making money from this crisis to cover a share of the costs,” he said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently said an additional £3bn needed pumping into the welfare system in response to soaring energy bills and mounting inflationary pressure. The report’s authors, Joseph Baines of King’s College London and Dr Sandy Hager of City University, said Centrica and SSE, which operate in the North Sea, had seen the sharpest increase in profit margins. They said that as oil and gas companies often made losses during periods of low wholesale gas and oil prices, they paid almost all their income to shareholders in more profitable periods. “BP’s shareholder payout commitments have been so large that they cover 98.3% of their pre-tax income and are 2.5 times larger than their tax payments for the same period,” the report said. “The findings may be combined with the insights on fossil-fuel subsidies offered by a recent Common Wealth report which identified an average of £12bn a year of taxpayer support for fossil fuels in the last five years,” they added. Oil traders could also be forced to pay a windfall tax, but the major firms – Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura, Mercuria and Gunvor – were not part of the study.",News/Business,Energy firms seeking Whitehall loans paid £200bn to shareholders since 2010,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/energy-firms-seeking-whitehall-loans-paid-200bn-to-shareholders-since-2010
1/16/2022,"It’s amazing, for me at least, to think that I have been working in horticulture for the best part of two decades. For almost all that time there has been real concern about how to get new audiences, and in particular younger people, into the art. I have often been invited to sit on industry boards to brainstorm new approaches and asked to consult on huge campaigns, all of which have simply insisted on churning out more of the same. So it is exciting to see young people are now doing it for themselves – in radically different ways, essentially creating what I think can only be described as a parallel horticultural universe. In the past five years there has been an absolute explosion in the interest in plants among younger generations. With the hashtag #plantsofinstagram racking up almost 13,000 posts, more than six times that of #avocadotoast, and some houseplant retailers reporting a 500% spike in interest over the past year or so, this is the radical transformation we have desperately needed.  But when you meet them, these new horticulturists don’t read gardening magazines, watch gardening television shows or even shop in garden centres. They often come from backgrounds like tropical fish or exotic pet keeping, or the geeky science of lighting or hydroponic tech. Or they have a passion for interior design, or simply a fascination with collecting rare things. But what they have in common is that almost all have got into plants through totally novel routes. To me, what is so fascinating about this is how it creates a palette of plants, new techniques and an aesthetic which are all wildly different to the staid horticultural norms I grew up with and which have remained largely unchanged for decades. And it seems to exist in an alternate gardening reality. They have really built their own gardening media on YouTube and Instagram that is far more dynamic, experimental and accessible than traditional garden media, which in my experience is notoriously risk adverse, repetitive and open only to people of a very fixed social and ethnic demographic. They have even started their own nurseries online, like the achingly cool Grow Tropicals, Spicesotic Plants and Ugly Plantling, sold on internet auction sites and at fairs with more ironic beards and arm tattoos than you might see at craft beer festivals. At a recent packed-out event, I asked the audience of young plant geeks, some decades younger than me – for my own curiosity – how many of them were actually trained horticulturists. Only two hands went up and both had been kicked out of horticultural college for allegedly collecting too many plants and for having unusual pets in their student dorms. No wonder things are changing, and thank goodness it’s for the better!

1/16/2022,"When the players of Coventry United were told training had been cancelled and they should join an online meeting with the club’s directors at 10am two days before Christmas, they had little idea about what was to follow. Sitting one place off the bottom on goal difference, the Championship side had been struggling, but why call this meeting now? The reality was far worse than anything they could have imagined. Also on the call were accountants from BK Plus, who had been instructed to assist the formal process of putting the club into voluntary liquidation.  The players and staff, who had not been paid for four weeks, were told their contracts were being terminated. Within days they had received formal notification that their employment had been terminated “with immediate effect”. According to one source, a creditors’ form was attached which disclosed the addresses of each player and staff member, and how much was owed to them. “It was a situation I hope never have to go through again,” says the manager, Jay Bradford, who has been with the club for 17 years. “I lost my dad in August so me and my mum were preparing for our first Christmas without him and had plans to go away and do different bits together. “Immediately I’m thinking about my own situation, I’m supposed to be going away and I’ve got a mortgage to pay but I’m not being paid, then I’ve got 24 players and X number of staff going: ‘What happens? What are we doing?’ I didn’t have the answers for them, which is difficult when I’ve always been the one that’s been able to answer their questions and give them information. It was so unexpected and I think we just felt blindsided by it.” It was such a bombshell because the club’s three owners – the proprietors and directors of the Coventry-based Mirius, owners of the cleaning brand Hycolin – had bought into Coventry United in December 2020 with the bold ambition of making the team fully professional. That goal had been realised but the poor results and the clear need for further investment was a “reality check” for them, says Bradford. “It’s a process,” says Bradford. “I kept saying to the original owners: ‘Yes, they spent a lot of money in the summer, but we haven’t spent enough.’ That wasn’t me being greedy and wanting the best players in the league, it was me saying we needed to compare our budget to the teams at the top. “I think hearing me say that may have been a bit of a reality check for them because we weren’t winning and we weren’t top, as they thought we would be. They thought what they’d invested was going to be enough, whereas actually we’d only really touched the surface.” As players and staff took to social media, Michael Mogan MBE, a fundraiser who was key to Coventry’s bid to become the 2021 City of Culture, became aware of their plight. At the request of his 10-year-old twin girls who play for Coventry United Juniors, he launched a Crowdfunder that raised more than £15,000 in 10 days to support the unpaid players. “It was phenomenal,” says Mogan of the response. “If I was to launch a campaign I would not launch it on 23 December, it’s the one time when we’re turning off our computers and our out-of-offices are on. So the fact that hundreds of people gave £15,000 within a couple of days, 1,000 people signed this petition and it was circulating widely at the hardest time of year to build momentum makes you realise that the groundswell of opinion is very, very strong.” Alerted to the club’s plight was the CEO of the energy company Angels Group, Lewis Taylor, who launched into action to attempt to buy and save the club before the deadline set for liquidation on 4 January. “When you see a lot of people about to lose their jobs, if you feel that you can help you should always help and that’s ultimately what drove the next steps,” he says. The liquidators then connected him with a sceptical Bradford, who met him for coffee on New Year’s Eve. After a chat with the team and staff in an online meeting the following day, during which he told them: “We can save this if you want me to,” he got the takeover ball rolling. He struck a deal with the existing stakeholders eight minutes before the deadline. While everyone waits for the paperwork to be completed and for Taylor to formally become chairman, the wages have begun to be paid from Mogan’s fundraiser, topped up with Taylor’s own money. A big barrier remains the FA’s 10-point deduction for any club that suffers an “insolvency event”. Coventry are appealing against the decision, pointing to the impact of the pandemic, Brexit and the energy crisis affecting businesses such as Mirius. “Ten points doesn’t seem right,” says Taylor. “I agree with the FA that women’s football needs to take its own path but in the men’s Championship for the same punishment it is a 12-point deduction, but there’s 138 points available if you win every game. In the Women’s Championship the punishment is a 10-point deduction out of a possible 66 points on offer, essentially 15% of the points available versus something like 8% in the men’s. “That doesn’t seem to fit when actually the women’s game needs more assistance, if anything it needs a leg up. Had we triggered administration, which we didn’t, I feel like there’d still be a valid argument there for that points deduction to be lower.” Taylor also believes there is a need for a “safe timezone” where clubs can raise a hand for help and support before they start to reach a crunch point. With the appeal continuing it is time for Coventry to get back to playing. First there is a trip to Sheffield United, then they play London City Lionesses at home on 23 January. That is a moment to pay back those that have supported them during this crisis, says Bradford. “Although these situations have happened before I think we’ve seen that people really do value the sport and they weren’t prepared just to let us be swept aside. I really hope that those people that donated, far and wide, make the effort to come because ultimately they’ve put us back on the pitch. “We have to have a mentality that says: ‘We nearly lost everything, and we didn’t. Now we need to be a force to be reckoned with.’ We’ve got 11 games left and we’re going to give it absolutely everything. It’ll either be the greatest comeback you’ve ever seen or it will relegate us but I can guarantee that we’re going to give it our absolute best.”",Sport/Football,How Coventry United battled back from brink of extinction,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/how-coventry-united-battled-back-from-brink-of-extinction
1/16/2022,"Vulnerable pregnant women are being imprisoned for non-violent offences, in some cases within just a few weeks of their babies’ due date, according to new research set to be published on Monday. It comes as a woman whose baby was stillborn in a prison toilet told the Observer that she will bring a lawsuit for breaches of human rights and discrimination because she did not receive the same standard of care as she could have expected in the community.  Academics who examined the experiences of 22 women who were pregnant while serving time in English prisons have called for alternatives to custodial sentences to avoid putting expectant mothers and unborn babies at risk. The women were sentenced for offences including robbery, drug offences, burglary, fraud and shoplifting. All but two of the offences were non-violent. Six of the women were sent to prison at 28 weeks pregnant or later and three were 36 weeks pregnant. The lead author, Rona Epstein of Coventry University, said the imprisonment of pregnant women was “unnecessary” and called for the use of community orders or suspended sentences instead. “The women we surveyed arrived in prison with a variety of complex needs stemming from poverty, homelessness, domestic violence and substance misuse,” she said. “The prison environment only adds another layer of trauma for these women and can be dangerous for the unborn child.” Naomi Delap, director of the charity Birth Companions, said: “This vital research shows, despite repeated assurances, prison should only be used as a last resort, pregnant women are being incarcerated for non-violent offences, sometimes very close to their babies’ due dates. “Many sentences are short enough to warrant a community sentence but long enough to destroy a woman’s life and expose her and her unborn baby to the risks of the prison system.” About 600 pregnant women enter UK prisons each year and about 50 are in prison at any one time. The authors of Why are Pregnant Women in Prison? began their study following the death of a baby at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Middlesex, in 2019. Their findings come days after a report into a second baby death at HMP Styal in Cheshire. Louise Powell, who did not know she was pregnant, spent several hours in labour “begging” for help on 18 June 2020. But a prison nurse failed to visit her despite three emergency calls, including one from a guard saying she “looked six months pregnant”. Her baby girl was unresponsive after a breach birth in a prison toilet. The prisons and probation ombudsman (PPO) Sue McAllister found there were missed opportunities to establish she needed urgent clinical attention. A nurse has been referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Speaking for the first time following the report, Powell told the Observer: “There were missed opportunities from prison staff… not thinking it was an emergency when I was begging for help. The health block was a 15-second walk away – they could have taken me there.” Her lawyer, Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, said expert evidence suggested the baby, named Brooke, could have survived had the response been different. Ryan, who is supporting Powell in bringing a discrimination case, explained: “Prisoners are entitled to the same standard of care as they would expect in the community.” Powell, who had been in prison for the first time after admitting common assault, harassment and criminal damage, said: “If I hadn’t been in prison, I would have dialled 999 because I knew it was a pain I hadn’t felt before. I felt like I was dying. I would have got to hospital when the pain first started. “My opinion is, having seen the expert evidence, that my baby could have survived and been alive today if I’d got to hospital sooner. I had felt her kicking earlier in the day.” She added: “I need accountability and I need to get justice for my daughter.” Data collected by the Observer found that jailed women in the UK are five times more likely to have a stillbirth as those living in the community. While the death of a baby in prison is rare, the Coventry University research echoes concerns raised by reports into the tragedies at Bronzefield and Styal, including delays in responding to women in labour or pain. One woman, Jodie, who was in prison for the first time on drug offences, wrote: “I was ignored and not believed that I was in labour. I was not responded to when I rang my cell bell… I was left from Saturday night to Monday morning in labour alone in my cell. The whole experience was traumatising.” Another woman, Ursula, said she constantly worried about her safety and was not listened to when she felt something was wrong. Maria Garcia de Frutos, a lecturer in midwifery at City, University of London and co-author of the report, said: “Structural failures and lack of timely access to care and specialist services are some of the inequalities reflected in our research.” The authors said it was “very concerning” that a woman who had experienced a possible placental abruption at 30 weeks and had a premature birth missed some midwifery appointments due to staff shortages at the prison. Her baby went on to spend nine weeks on a neonatal intensive care unit. Delap said: “These findings contribute to evidence that there are near misses and serious incidents happening behind locked doors but, because they don’t result in the death of a baby, the public don’t hear about them. There is a hidden healthcare crisis among pregnant prisoners which is not properly scrutinised.” The government has plans to build 500 new prison cells for women. But the chief executive of the charity Women in Prison, Kate Paradine, said: “There is another way – when women are supported in the community, they have better access to care and can tackle the issues that sweep them into crime in the first place, like trauma, domestic abuse and poverty.” Eleven countries, including Russia, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, already have laws to prevent pregnant women from going to prison. Spectrum Community Health CIC said it accepted the findings of the PPO report and was working closely with staff at HMP Styal to further enhance the care and support women receive when entering prison. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “While custody should remain the last resort for most women, we have made significant improvements to support female offenders, including pregnant women. Our new prison places will give them greater access to education, healthcare and employment and we are introducing specialist mother and baby liaison officers across the estate. “We extend our deepest sympathies to Ms Powell and are also looking at how we can better screen for pregnancy in jails so no woman falls through the cracks.” The government is working with NHS England to provide guidance for prison staff on how to respond in the event of an unexpected birth.",News/Society,Call to stop jailing pregnant women in England after baby dies in prison toilet,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/16/call-to-stop-jailing-pregnant-women-in-england-after-baby-dies-in-prison-toilet
1/16/2022,"Heather Knight has faced some stiff challenges in her five years as England captain, but the four-month odyssey down under – when her side will first attempt to regain the Ashes and then defend the 50-over World Cup won in 2017 – is undoubtedly the toughest of the lot. The recent Covid-enforced rejigging of the Ashes schedule means the series is condensed into a three-week block, with the three T20s now to be played first, starting on Thursday. They will be followed by the one-off Test and three ODIs. From there, players will fly to New Zealand to begin a 10-day quarantine, before facing off yet again in both side’s first encounter of the World Cup on 5 March.  That Knight’s opposite number, Meg Lanning, took a break after the conclusion of the Women’s Big Bash in November to prepare for the intensity of the coming months is telling. “You always feel a sense of responsibility as captain,” says Knight , acknowledging the acute pressure she faces over the coming weeks. “You want to lead from the front and be successful and help the team win games of cricket. But I’ve had quite a lot of experience of doing that and hopefully it’s pressure I’ve managed pretty well in the past. “I won’t be changing too much in how I approach things and how I do things just because it’s an Ashes and a World Cup. I want to be as consistent as I possibly can in who I am as a person, how I prepare, how I chat to the girls. I’ll try and keep it as normal as possible.” Normality is a relative concept at the moment. England’s preparations for the tour have been badly affected by the spread of Omicron, first back in the UK and now in Australia. Players have been isolating at home since Christmas in order to ensure they could fly to Australia Covid-free and face severe restrictions on their activities for the duration of the series. “For those two weeks before we left England, we could only train as individuals and with our households,” Knight says. “We’ve had mums feeding bowling machines, boyfriends slinging, girlfriends slinging, dads batting and any family members or households supporting our training. As you can imagine it’s been pretty comical, but also not ideal preparation for a series of this magnitude.” Partly in response to Covid outbreaks in both camps during the men’s Ashes series, Cricket Australia has imposed strict restrictions on the women’s teams. “The restrictions changed overnight whilst we were on the flight,” Knight says. “We’re not allowed to go for dinner anywhere, even outdoors. We’re only allowed to socialise outdoors and try and distance as much as we can.” Even with these precautions, Covid has hit the England camp, with a member of support staff recording a positive test on Friday. The unspoken fear is that an outbreak could wreck not just the Ashes but either team’s forthcoming World Cup campaign. Due to quarantine rules, if a player is not Covid-free on 9 February – when the squads are due to fly to New Zealand – they will miss the tournament. For England, the rescheduling is particularly challenging given that much of their pre-series training camp in Oman was focused on red-ball cricket, in anticipation of the Test that was originally due to be the series curtain-raiser. Some of the scheduled warm-ups against the England A side that have accompanied the main side to Australia have also had to be curtailed; the two squads are being kept as separate as possible in an attempt to limit the spread of any potential infection. “Mentally it’s been tough but we’re doing everything we can to try and get ourselves prepped and be ready for the first game,” Knight says. “Mainly, the strategy we’ve found is to make jokes and try and laugh about it and try and keep everyone as relaxed as possible and try and find the funny side of it. We’ve got to keep tight as a group, we’ve got to keep spirits high.” Knight has an enviable record on Australian wickets, especially Canberra – the setting for the Test and the first ODI – where she hit her maiden T20 hundred, in February 2020. Even so, beating the world’s No 1 side away from home, with limited match preparation and Covid breathing down their necks, may prove one demand too many for England.",Sport/Sport,Heather Knight faces her toughest task as England try to regain Ashes | Raf Nicholson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/heather-knight-england-australia-womens-ashes-preview
1/16/2022,"At the end of 2021, Rylan had his teeth knocked out. During two operations under general anaesthetic, then a third under local, his teeth, £25,000 veneers which had become both a trademark and a punchline, were hammered, then chiselled away. “New teeth,” he smiles, his grin now modest, “New hair, new start,” and then he frowns, “New me.” Neither of us were expecting the interview to go like this. Rylan (born Ross Clark in east London – his mother moved the family to Essex after homophobic bullies fractured his skull when he was in his early teens) was intending to talk about his charming new podcast, Ry-Union, his latest project in a series of jolly presenting gigs that began after his appearance on X Factor 10 years ago and really never stopped. “I started off as the joke,” he glitters, “and I’m still laughing.” We were expecting a hoot, is what I mean. We were expecting to chuckle through stories of his unlikely stardom, the cosy place he holds in the heart of the British public, the way he ascended from comedy figure to national treasure over the course of a decade, but he’s had a very bad, no-good year, and though he was not expecting to talk about it, having not yet explained its depths to most of his friends, suddenly there we are.  But first, an introduction, for readers unfamiliar with Big Brother or his Radio 2 show or Gogglebox, or his used-car adverts on telly that recently provoked an outraged stranger to tweet the car dealer, “I will never buy a car from you whilst that complete buck tooth ignoramus @Rylan is advertising your company! Illiterate, talentless, council nobody!” and Rylan to reply, “THEN WALK, MATE.” His early career plan was to “get famous”, and it’s almost despite this that Rylan, now 33, has become the star he is today. In 2012 he was a joke contestant on X Factor, destined surely for a life having beer thrown at him at club appearances just outside the M25 – at the end of that year he and Jimmy Savile were battling for bad press, with death threats leading to 24-hour security. But the public grew to adore him, seeing a brightness, wit and authenticity beneath the tan. “The first six months of my career,” he says, explaining why he’s always got time for fans wielding cameras, “were a public vote.” In 2014, after winning Celebrity Big Brother, he appeared in Grayson Perry’s Channel 4 series on identity, and Perry tells me that he still has a “great affection” for Rylan. When they met, says Perry, “He was going through a rapid, very 21st-century transition to fame. I describe him as looking like a ‘computer-generated Tudor nobleman’ but in stark contrast his personality is a very warm Essex man of the people.” As they walked through a shopping centre together, mothers handed him their babies for photos. He’s easy and funny, Perry adds, and crucially, “aware of his own ridiculousness”. It was this self-awareness that led to Ross creating Rylan, his professional persona – “which I think was the healthiest thing I ever chose to do,” he nods. He’s wearing a tracksuit so white it’s almost blue, and a black cap that he adjusts at times of unease. “It’s how I actually got through all the shit in the beginning, because I was like, it’s fine – they’re talking about Rylan. They’re not talking about Ross. Ross sits in tracksuits and watches reruns of Keeping Up Appearances.” And Rylan? “Rylan is always smiling.” And then our conversation shifts. Last summer Rylan split up with Dan, his husband of six years, an ex-Big Brother contestant he met while interviewing him post-eviction. Soon after their split it was announced that Rylan would be taking some time off his presenting duties, and he went quiet for four months. “I’d got to the point where I didn’t know if I wanted to come back. Or whether I would be able to do this job again. I’d got… quite ill,” he says, cautiously. He stopped eating. “I went down to just over 9st and I’m 6ft 4in. It got bad. Like, very bad. And I didn’t think it would get better. I needed help.” He pauses. Believe it or not, he says, “I’m very private, really, and I want to remain that way. But there were points then when it was like Where’s Wally, people flying drones over my house asking, ‘Where the fuck is he?’ They knew something was really wrong when I didn’t turn up to present Eurovision!” A dark laugh. He loves Eurovision. “Everyone feels like I’m their mate. I was probably talking to five million people a night. But last summer for the first time, I literally felt alone.” He leans in. “I’ve always been strong. I’ve always taken a lot of shit. And this is where Rylan and Ross come into play. Because when it’s Rylan I’m a brick wall. You can take the piss out of my teeth, call me a cunt, and I’ll just go, that’s fine. This is what I get paid for. But when it’s Ross, I don’t deal with that well. And when you find out something you always wanted isn’t what you thought it was…” He shakes his head as if confused. “I didn’t think I’d be here. I didn’t think I could continue.” Could continue to work, I ask, or to live? “Both. I didn’t think I’d actually come back. I was very… gone.” He looks surprised to be sharing this, and a little embarrassed, too, because this is not the Rylan brand fans have come to know – the cheeky jokes, the laughing it off, the silver linings found at the bottom of a crisp packet. “I’m the last person that my friends would ever believe could feel as low as I did. Superficially, on paper, I can look after myself, but actually in that moment and for months after, none of the money or the fame mattered. I did not know myself at certain points. I was having thoughts and doing things that made me… fucked up, for want of a better word. I didn’t understand why I was doing that to myself. So, I went away for a bit.” To hospital? “Yes. For safety reasons.” He coughs gently. “It’s really strange talking about this, because I’ve not even spoken about it to my friends. I just never thought I could get that ill.” The trigger was the divorce, but he’s realising now that there was more to his breakdown, that alongside his success, something else had been building. The space between his two lives had become swampish, hungry. His identity was wobbling. “It’s 10 years that I’ve been doing this job. And I think that whole decade slapped me around the arse and stabbed me in the stomach. Maybe I needed it to happen. I just wish it hadn’t happened as hard as it did.” He holds eye contact, and we sit for a second. “I think I’m finding a new ‘me’ now. I’m so good at being Rylan. I know my job – what’s right, what’s wrong, what works, what doesn’t – I do Rylan really well. But actually, I didn’t realise how much Ross I’d lost.” What did he learn in hospital? “That I always say yes to everything and I nod and smile. But now if there’s something I really don’t want to do, I’m going to say no. I’ve learned to be more in control. I’ve not had control for so long, I feel like Britney!” Why hasn’t he had control? “Because my life was really my job. I feel like I lost a lot of me. I’ve learned that fame is something that I wanted, but not necessarily the thing I want still. And don’t get me wrong, it’s always lovely meeting people and being treated certain ways. But sometimes it’s important to stand in the queue. Sometimes you want to just fuck off over the garden centre to buy a plant.” As somebody who has looked at fame from inside and out, reaching for it, respecting the parts other people sniff at, enjoying its frillier thrills, it’s fitting that he’s choosing to question it, too. An ex-reality TV star who still talks about Big Brother with affectionate reverence (“That show was like my baby. And as much as I love working on everything I’ve done since, I don’t think I’ll ever find that bubble again,”) he holds a unique position on primetime TV, a kind of expert witness. After the deaths of former Love Island contestants, “I was asked a lot about my views on aftercare in reality TV,” he says, “But I was the worst person to ask, because for me it never stopped. I was never in that position where I had to go back to work in a shop. But this year, all of my employers were brilliant. And when I say I disappeared, I literally disappeared. I think they knew how bad I was.” There were reports he’d been crying during songs while presenting his Radio 2 show. “There were a select few people that needed to know that I was a danger to myself.” Behind him, shuffling through her bag, his makeup artist and best friend Bernice is trying not to cry. “Strange situations do very strange things to people. If it wasn’t for my mum, and my family and close friends I genuinely have no idea if I’d be here.” He is shocking himself with every sentence, his hat coming off and going back on, his cigarette smoking itself. “I learned I’m worth something. That I should be proud of myself, not embarrassed of Rylan. I should be proud that I can build my mum a house. I should be proud that I can employ my family. I learned that.” He hurries away the beginnings of a tear with his hand. “Oof, sorry. Anyway!” A few weeks after he’d come off X Factor, Rylan was in Selfridges buying pants when he heard someone call his name. Turning round, he saw Barbara Windsor. They’d met in a green room a month earlier, and they greeted each other with appropriate delight. “Then she introduced me to her husband and I was like, ‘Hello, Scott. Lovely to meet you!’ She said, ‘No, darling. You said hello to him a few weeks back at X Factor’. I was so sorry. Like, all over the place. And she said, ‘Let me give you the best piece of advice you’ll ever need. Never say, “Nice to meet you.” It’s always, “Lovely to see you.”’ And for the past 10 years, Barbara Windsor has got me out of so many awkward scrapes. If she was still with us today I would give her the biggest kiss. Meeting Madonna, Britney, pah, they just pale in comparison.” Jo Brand, though, he liked her. A few weeks before we speak she had presented Have I Got News For You, and it was Rylan’s first time as a panellist. He was a hit, inviting Brand to Ibiza, teasing Ian Hislop about hanging around Essex. “I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again,” tweeted radio presenter James O’Brien that night. “Rylan is a huge talent. A born storyteller with exceptional comic timing and a beautifully rare streak of self-awareness.” And someone, too, it was clear, who is deeply engaged with politics. “You know,” he cackles elegantly, “whenever I talk about politics publicly, you’ll get all the idiots going, ‘What the fuck does he know, X Factor reject?’ But it’s probably a lot more than they do.” In the past he’s admitted his love of Prime Minister’s Questions and obsession with the horrors of Brexit. “I need to be careful because I work for the BBC and someone might shoot me,” he says, “but I feel our country needs to be run by people that live in this world. It’s very opinionated to say, but I think it’s time for party-less politics, don’t you? I think it’s time for one government to run this country and for politicians to start working together, rather than sitting there like children and having rows in the House of Commons. I just think it’s ridiculous.” Could he see himself getting into politics? “If I weren’t Rylan, maybe!” Might Rylan stop at some point? Might he make way for Ross, and a slower life, and a still dimmer smile? “If I did, then yes – that’s something that I’d love to get into. Rylan for PM!” He grins. “But come on, really, would you vote for me?” In a heartbeat. Listen to Ry-Union on all podcast platforms.

1/16/2022,"Things are not looking good for Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the Queen’s second son formerly known as His Royal Highness. Last week, a judge in New York rejected his attempt to get the sexual abuse lawsuit Virginia Giuffre has filed against him thrown out. Giuffre is suing him for damages, claiming that she was forced to have sex with him three times in 2001 by the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and his sex trafficker accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, allegations that Andrew denies. The royal family responded by announcing that he has been stripped of his military honours, royal patronages and the use of his HRH title. Any praise for the monarchy for depriving him of his titles is misplaced. The royal family left it until the last possible moment to act. Andrew has brought them into far graver disrepute than Prince Harry, who lost his titles for what, by comparison, is the laughably inconsequential transgression of walking away. The raging debate about the consequences for the monarchy is a distraction from the sexual abuse allegations at stake and accountability for the men complicit in the crimes of Epstein and Maxwell. It should not take a man of Andrew’s obviously questionable character to expose the absurdities of a constitutional hereditary monarchy in a modern democracy.  Strip away the yachts, the private jets and the glamorous locations from Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes and what is left is a depressingly familiar story of sex trafficking: vulnerable women and girls, some as young as 14, abused by men who feel entitled to their bodies and so do not bother to ask themselves why these girls are at their disposal. There is little to separate these nameless but powerful men and the men who visit seedy brothels housing girls who have been trafficked and exploited, or who get off on online violent porn in which women are hurt and abused. All may lighten their consciences by telling themselves it is all consenting, but who are they kidding? Andrew has been implicated in the crimes of his friends since Giuffre alleged several years ago that he sexually assaulted her three times when she was 17, in London, in New York and at an “orgy” on Epstein’s private Caribbean island. The judge’s decision last week means that he may well find himself being deposed to give evidence to a New York court. Everyone is owed due process, Andrew included, but he must face some extremely inconvenient truths. After hosting Epstein and Maxwell at Windsor Castle and Sandringham, he invited them to his daughter’s 18th birthday party even after Florida police had issued an arrest warrant for him. He chose to stay with Epstein in New York in 2010 after the latter had already been imprisoned for sex offences with children, in a residence where Epstein kept a “massage room” where he abused and photographed girls. Andrew had previously stayed in Epstein’s Florida house, where the financier had on display a photo of himself with a semi-naked prepubescent girl in a sexualised pose; one witness claims it was “full” of nude pictures of women and girls and that there were naked girls by the pool when Andrew was visiting. Despite Andrew saying he cannot remember meeting Giuffre, there is a photo of them together in Maxwell’s London house, where she says he assaulted her, with his hand around her bare midriff. Witnesses have put them together on more than one occasion; one says he saw Andrew kissing a topless Giuffre by the pool. Andrew has not yet been able to produce any evidence that he took his daughter to a party at Pizza Express in Woking on the day Giuffre says he assaulted her in London or of the medical condition that he says casts doubt on her account that he sweated profusely while with her in a nightclub. US prosecutors say that he has refused requests to assist their investigations into Epstein and Maxwell. Faced with allegations like these, men like Andrew have various strategies. One is to cooperate with the authorities, to tell the truth and refrain from throwing mud at a woman who, before she turned 18, was the victim of sex trafficking and sexual abuse by two of your acquaintances. Another is to do anything to undermine your alleged victim. The guilty cannot do the first and so often resort to the latter playbook, drawn on by powerful men such as Harvey Weinstein who feel entitled to use women decades their junior for their own sexual gratification. Andrew’s former spin doctor tried to suggest that the photo with Giuffre was doctored. His lawyers have deployed every tactic possible in submissions on his behalf: accusing Giuffre of being a gold digger seeking a “payday at his expense”; arguing that despite being a child when she was trafficked, she is more offender than victim; accusing her of making unintelligible and vague revelations; arguing that the New York law under which she is bringing the lawsuit is unconstitutional; claiming Andrew was protected by a clause in Epstein’s 2009 financial settlement with Giuffre. Some of these arguments have already been tossed out by the judge. And there is always the implicit warning from men like Andrew or, in a different abuse-of-power context, Bill Clinton: undermine me and you undermine the institution, handing victory to republicans of one sort or another. The intended result is to jack up the price that women such as Giuffre must pay for seeking accountability to unbearable. It is no coincidence that the only living person to be serving time in prison for her terrible crimes is Epstein’s female accomplice, Maxwell: what of the men who helped themselves to the vulnerable women and girls they trafficked? Those men wield a great power – the threat of ruined reputations, of hounding by tabloid – in service of their own protection. We may never know which of the rich old men who fraternised with Epstein, flew in his jet and enjoyed his hospitality were complicit in his crimes. But all hail Virginia Giuffre for her bravery and tenacity in the pursuit of justice.

1/16/2022,"In December my daughter brought Covid home from school as if a folded permission slip. The feeling, on seeing the two pink lines come up on her test, was complicated and raw, containing both bad memories and relief. Finally (a part of me thought, a part of me quite low down and bloodied), finally the thing we have been waiting for has arrived. I breathed out a breath I had been holding for two years. There were six or seven other feelings, too, including a now-familiar sense of doom brought on by the realisation that for us, lockdown was to begin again. A gentle PTSD crawled in and made itself comfortable on my lap as I briefly mapped out the next two months of arguments and pasta in my mind. Of course, with rude inevitability, the virus took its time spreading through the house, lingering on our daughter, only taking up residence with our boy toddler when her isolation was nearing its end. He stopped sleeping, his temperature leaping up and down like a cat when the doorbell goes.  Midway through our son’s isolation my partner looked at me and regretfully said, “I feel odd.” He had it, I did not, on we went, greyly. On Christmas Day, having tested relentlessly, I took the children to my parents’ house where the five of us had a token celebration, but at some point after the crackers I started to feel not good. By the time I got home I was feverish and slightly wild, my throat swollen, my mood vile. Had a faulty test meant I’d put my parents at risk? I went to bed. I’m used to pain. I can deal with migraines, even those that are clattery and awful or must be taken personally. I’m used to grimly carrying on, one eye shut. But I’m unaccustomed to illness like this, where, wheezing and achy, I have no choice but to pass over all caregiving duties in order to lie down and doze through the new series of Sex and the City, on which I formed many sharp yet neurologically suspect opinions. I slept for days, getting up only to eat muesli and do lateral flow tests, all negative. The lack of a positive result made me feel a little mad, as if I had somehow slipped through reality’s fine gauze to another timeline where Wuhan’s animal market had been closed that day. That week I’d been reading Hanya Yanagihara’s new novel, To Paradise, the final third of which is set in New York at the end of the 21st century, a place where increasingly deadly pandemics have ushered in totalitarianism. It was a bad time, I see now, to read a story about a future defined by sickness, to read about sterilisation, state surveillance, where a mother isolates her immuno-compromised twins for their entire life as yet another virus threatens their society, and how, when she catches it, leaving them without care, the two boys leave their compound for the first time and die in the garden, “their lives becoming glorious – for once – even as they ended”. A bad time. Lying in the linen darkness of a winter afternoon while the government blustered its way through unprecedented levels of Covid infections and my baby coughed downstairs. A bad time, Hanya! When my second PCR test came back negative, too, I left the house, shakily but with intent. If I wasn’t going to have Covid then I sure as hell wasn’t going to stay inside that germ-thick house one second longer. I didn’t last long; outside there was mostly mud. When I got back to bed I read about a case of “flurona”, a rare new double infection of coronavirus and influenza that’s been discovered in a young, pregnant, unvaccinated Israeli woman. “Lol,” I croaked, to nobody. I’m much better now, thank you for asking. My cough, while rancid, no longer rattles the cutlery, and my limbs, while still aching, are now entirely capable of navigating at least a staircase. My mood, though, remains in limbo, vigilant to the slightest interior shift. It’s a strange feeling to be ill with the wrong thing. To live in a state immersed in a single virus – a sickness that provokes outrage and dry coughs, and shuts down schools and burns out the NHS, and inspires protesters to storm testing centres in a selection of quite bad jeans – but to be struck down by another one altogether, one with similar symptoms but fewer culture wars. Here I found the modern version of Fomo, less bothered by smoky parties and the potential of sex, more concerned with missing out on the hottest new variant, especially when the rest of your family are now happily immune for at least a fortnight. Why did everyone else in the house get it and not me, I mutter into a tissue – had I been such a bad wife and mother that I hadn’t been within their breathing spaces all month? What was the point of the night sweats, the hacking cough, the headaches and breathlessness if not to have been a brave little soldier and survived a pandemic? Honestly.

1/16/2022,"On the eve of what would have been David Bowie’s 75th birthday, Tilda Swinton told me that she had always considered him to be her spiritual “cousin”. Nowhere is this connection clearer than in Floria Sigismondi’s 2013 video for The Stars (Are Out Tonight), in which Bowie and Swinton play a suburban couple haunted by their alien-like alter egos – the ghosts of fame. Significant, too, that one of Swinton’s early starring roles saw her playing an extraterrestrial visitor in Friendship’s Death (1987), a film that could easily have been titled The Woman Who Fell to Earth. Like Bowie, Swinton has always possessed an uncanny ability to meld the natural and the supernatural – the down-to-earth and the out-of-this-world. That’s a quality put to perfect use in the latest film from the Thai maestro Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Indefinable in terms of plot, this Cannes jury prize winner (which became Colombia’s submission for the 94th Oscars this year) is a dreamlike cocktail that brings together human sensory experience, disrupted natural order, canine curses, exploding head syndrome, viral growths, ancient bones, modern machines, improvised jazz, geopolitical upheavals and the “invisible people” of the Amazon, all tinged by “the perfume of decay… a fermented wound”.  Swinton plays Jessica, a flower trader who, like Bowie’s Thomas Jerome Newton, is an anxious outsider, her face touched by the shadow of lonely desperation and the merest hint of horror. When Jessica hears a strange booming noise, she assumes it’s just building works. Out in the street, a cacophony of car alarms implies some unseen visitation. Yet this particular sound (“like a big concrete ball that falls into a metal well which is surrounded by seawater”) seems to be for Jessica’s ears only. We are in Bogotá, where Jessica’s sister Karen (Agnes Brekke) is in hospital. Early scenes quietly establish a bond and a distance between these two – shared experience fractured by divergent perspectives. As the “rumble from the core of the Earth” continues to unsettle Jessica, she turns to a sound engineer whom she enlists to reproduce the noise, but who then disappears without trace, as if he were never there. Was he, like that enigmatic boom, a figment of her imagination? Or is Jessica somehow slipping between despoiled worlds, caught in the crossfire of contradictory narratives (she’s assured that someone she thought was dead is in fact alive and well)? It says much about the strangely hypnotic nature of Memoria’s “slow cinema” aesthetic that we are willing to let possible answers simply hang in the air. From the extended opening shot that lingers long before Jessica wakes, to an eerily held closeup of an unblinking face caught in a death-like, dreamless sleep, the film is in no hurry to reveal its mysteries. As with his 2010 Palme d’Or winner Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, Weerasethakul leaves us trembling on the edge of uncertainty, providing just enough terra firma to keep the viewer engaged while leading them deeper into the realms of the unknown. At times, Memoria felt to me like an unironic riposte to Barbet Schroeder’s 1972 pop-culture oddity La Vallée (AKA Obscured by Clouds), in which Bulle Ogier ventures into the New Guinean mountains in search of ecstatic truth. There’s certainly a powerful element of transcendence in Jessica’s encounter with a solitary time-slipped soul in whose company she faces quietly stunning revelations about life, the universe and everything. It’s at this point that the film takes a fantastical leap that viewers will find either breathtaking or ridiculous – probably a bit of both. In the US, distributors Neon made much of programming Memoria to play “in front of only one solitary audience at any given time”, like a travelling roadshow exhibition (“Let’s embrace the darkness and dream, one at a time,” said Weerasethakul). That strategy isn’t being repeated here, but it tells us something about the installation-like nature of the movie, a trancey quality epitomised by a scene in which Jessica wanders through a gallery as the lights go out, eerily mirroring the experience of those mesmerised cinema-goers for whom it was so clearly intended.",Arts/Film,Memoria review – Tilda Swinton works her magic in enigmatic fantasy,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/16/memoria-review-tilda-swinton-apichatpong-weerasethakul
1/16/2022,"The recent decision by regulators to approve the antiviral agent Paxlovid for use in the UK adds a formidable new weapon to the arsenal of treatments for Covid-19. Pfizer says the drug has almost 90% success in preventing severe illness in vulnerable adults if taken soon after infection occurs. Paxlovid is one of a growing repertoire of antiviral medicines – which also includes Merck’s agent Molnurpiravir – that can be given to people who have contracted the disease. Crucially, antivirals – which disrupt a virus’s ability to replicate inside an infected cell – provide hope that infected vulnerable individuals, including the very elderly and those with compromised immune systems, can be kept out of hospital. It has taken two years of research for the first antivirals to be approved, with drugs becoming available more than a year after the first Covid vaccines were given in the UK. So why has it taken so long, comparatively, for effective antivirals to be developed? And what role will they play in the UK, which now has broad vaccine protection against Covid?  Vaccines come first and antivirals afterwards when most predictions suggested it would be the other way around. Why? “I expected antivirals would be in use before vaccines, I admit,” says Tom Fletcher of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “What actually happened reflects the unbelievable speed of the vaccine research and the failure of the first tranche of antivirals that were tested.” At the start of the pandemic, most effort went on considering repurposed drugs – ones used to treat other illnesses but which had established safety profiles – in order to treat Covid-19. “However, none of these repurposed antivirals have worked,” added Fletcher, who is also a member of the UK Agile trial that tries to find new Covid treatments. “After that, scientists focused on new antivirals specifically designed for Covid-19. Normally, drug development pipelines take five to 10 years at best. These timelines have been accelerated but it has still taken two years to get to this point.” How will the new antiviral drugs be used? Doctors have learned a great deal about treating Covid-19 patients in hospitals. “They have greatly improved outcomes for seriously ill patients – through knowing when to turn them, administer dexamethasone or give them intravenous antibodies,” said Ruth McKernan, chair of the BioIndustry Association. “But prevention is better than cure. So keeping people out of hospital is the real goal here and the new oral antivirals should be invaluable in achieving that.” Once a vulnerable person – someone who is old or has a compromised immune system – becomes infected, they will be given Paxlovid or Molnurpiravir and that, it is hoped, will prevent them becoming so sick that they need to go to hospital, which is good news for the patient and for the NHS. What still needs to be discovered about antivirals? “Clinical trials of antivirals began shortly after Covid first arrived, so they were tested almost totally on non-vaccinated patients,” said Eddie Gray, chair of the UK government’s antivirals taskforce. “Today, we have a population that is largely vaccinated. So we need to show that antivirals still have real benefits for these people.” This data will be provided by an Oxford University study, called Panoramic, which is assessing the impact of antivirals on vulnerable but vaccinated people in the UK. “Panoramic is very important,” added Gray. “It’s the mechanism by which we will work out the magnitude of the benefit our vaccinated population gets from antivirals. We expect results next month.” What lessons are there for treating Covid from other use of antivirals? “These drugs operate by disrupting the way that a virus produces copies of itself inside our cells and we have seen this process being deployed in antivirals that deal with other diseases,” added Gray. “One implication is that they are likely to be very effective in tackling new variants of Covid.”",News/World news,How antivirals provide hope to vulnerable Covid patients,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/how-antivirals-provide-hope-to-vulnerable-covid-patients
1/16/2022,"England’s north-south divide continues to deepen despite two years of “levelling-up” rhetoric from the government, according to a landmark new report to be published tomorrow. Entitled State of the North 2021, and produced by IPPR North, the northern branch of the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, the report compares levels of public investment in London and the south-east with that in the north. Its authors estimate that, in the five years to 2019/20, London received the equivalent of £12,147 per person, while in the north the figure was only £8,125.  Treasury data indicated that if investment in the north had matched that in London over the five years from 2014/15, it would have meant an extra £61bn of spending in areas such as transport, infrastructure and skills. The south-east, the report states, is home to one-third of the UK population but now accounts for 45% of its economy and 42% of its wealth. The stark disparities will fuel concerns among “red wall” Conservative MPs that the government’s flagship policy is underfunded, and do not fulfil Boris Johnson’s promise to rebalance the economy. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has effectively capped the main levelling-up fund at £4.8bn for this parliament. Critics say this is a drop in the ocean after decades of underinvestment and 10 years of austerity cuts. In November, after pressure from the Treasury, the promised eastern leg of HS2 from Birmingham to Leeds was scrapped and a proposed high-speed line between Manchester and Leeds downgraded. At the time of those decisions, the chair of the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, Jake Berry, challenged Johnson over whether “voters in the north [were] right to take the prime minister at his word”. As well as highlighting the scale of the funding gap between the north and south-east, the IPPR report also points to Germany, where successive governments have spent an average of €70bn a year reducing regional divides since reunification in 1990. Jonathan Webb, one of the report’s authors, said: “However we measure investment in levelling up – whether we compare with Germany’s successful efforts to rebalance its economy, or to London-level investment – it’s clear that central government simply hasn’t put its money where its mouth is when it comes to rebalancing the economy. Levelling up will be consigned to the list of hollow, unmet promises made to people in regions like the north for a long time now, if it isn’t underpinned by investment and, crucially, fiscal devolution.” The levelling-up white paper, detailing the government’s plans, has been repeatedly delayed. It is now due by the end of the month. Responding to the IPPR study, the shadow secretary of state for levelling up, Lisa Nandy, said: “For all the talk of levelling up, the story of this government has been to strip power from communities across Britain. After a decade of empty slogans and broken promises, the levelling-up paper must finally provide the resources and a plan to deliver the radical change we have been promised.”",News/Society,"England’s north-south divide is deepening, says new report",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/16/englands-north-south-divide-is-deepening-says-new-report
1/16/2022,"Scientists have uncovered the world’s oldest social network, a web of connections that flourished 50,000 years ago and stretched for thousands of miles across Africa. But unlike its modern electronic equivalent, this ancient web of social bonds used a far more prosaic medium. It relied on the sharing and trading of beads made of ostrich eggshells – one of humanity’s oldest forms of personal adornment.  The research by scientists in Germany involved the study of more than 1,500 of these beads, which were dug up at more than 30 sites across southern and east Africa. Careful analysis suggests that people who made the beads – which are still manufactured and worn by hunter-gatherers in Africa today – were exchanging them over vast distances, helping to share symbolic messages and to strengthen alliances. “It’s like following a trail of breadcrumbs,” said the study’s lead author, Jennifer Miller, of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in the city of Jena. “The beads are clues, scattered across time and space, just waiting to be noticed.” The study, published in Nature last week, compared beads found at 31 sites in southern and eastern Africa, spanning more than 1,800 miles. By comparing the outside diameter of a shell, the diameter of the holes inside them, and the thickness of the walls of the eggshell, the scientists learned that about 50,000 years ago people in eastern and southern Africa started to make nearly identical beads out of ostrich eggs. Yet these groups and communities were separated by vast distances, which suggests the existence of a long-distance social network that stretched over thousands of miles, connecting people in far-flung regions. “The result is surprising, but the pattern is clear,” said the study’s other author, Yiming Wang, who is also based at the Max Planck. Ostrich eggshell beads are some of the oldest forms of self-decoration found in the archaeological record, although they were not the first to be adopted by Homo sapiens. Scientists believe men and women started daubing themselves with the reddish pigment ochre about 200,000 years ago, before starting to wear beads 75,000 years ago. However, the ornament industry really took off about 50,000 years ago in Africa, with the manufacture of the first ostrich eggshell beads – the earliest standardised form of jewellery known to archaeology. This was the world’s first “bling” and its use represents one of humanity’s longest-running cultural traditions, involving the expression of identity and relationships. As Miller put it: “These tiny beads have the power to reveal big stories about our past.” Or as archaeologist Michelle Langley of Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, has said: “Bling is valuable: it tells us something about the person who wore it. More bling in the archaeological record indicates more interactions. Traded bling tells us who was talking to whom.” The crucial point about ostrich eggshell jewellery is, instead of relying on an item’s natural size or shape, humans began to shape the shells directly and create opportunities for variations in style to develop. The resulting patterns gave the researchers a route through which they could trace cultural connections, though it is unclear if the ostrich eggshell beads studied by Miller and Wang were traded between groups or if it was the knowledge of how to manufacture them that was exchanged. Most evidence points to the latter. The world’s first social network did not last. About 33,000 years ago, the pattern of bead-wearing abruptly changed: they disappeared from southern Africa while continuing in east Africa. Miller and Wang suggest climatic changes lay behind this, bringing an end to the planet’s oldest social network – albeit after 17,000 years.",News/Science,"Trail of African bling reveals 50,000-year-old social network",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/16/trail-of-african-bling-reveals-50000-year-old-social-network
1/16/2022,"Stefanos Tsitsipas learned to listen to Covid science the hard way. Not the really hard way, of course. Not the hard way that more unfortunate vaccine-resisters have experienced, after they’ve ingested conspiracy theories about side effects and regurgitated social media promises that there’s no risk to the young and healthy. The world’s number-four ranked tennis player didn’t, mercifully, find himself laid low by the virus or on a ventilator in hospital – he just found himself publicly rebuked by his own government. While Tsitsipas’s father-cum-coach, Apostolos, gave interviews claiming that “athletes have a strong enough immune system to deal with any challenge”, Greece’s government spokesman was pointing out that a 23-year-old tennis player, however successful in his field, had “neither the knowledge, nor the studies, nor the research work” to offer valid opinions on vaccination. The story had a happy ending, though: Tsitsipas did indeed stop spouting poorly informed conjecture and got himself jabbed.  On Friday, just three days before the Australian Open was due to begin, he was one of the many players sharing their views on Novak Djokovic’s visa-related trials. “There are two ways to look at it,” said Tsitsipas. “One side of it is that almost every single player is fully vaccinated… and has followed the protocols to play in Australia. On the other hand, it seems not everyone is playing by the rules.” These words sounded less like opposing perspectives and more like a single, pointed, point. “A very small majority chose to follow their own way,” said Tsitsipas, “which kind of makes the majority look like fools.” And so, for the second time on the subject of Covid, Tsitsipas was again in the wrong. Because Djokovic’s stand hasn’t made his peers look foolish at all. In the midst of what Rafael Nadal has accurately dubbed “a circus” – a procedural farce of legal miasma, medical obfuscation and crowd-playing politics – his fellow tennis players are the ones who have emerged looking the least like clowns. It is they, rather than the sport’s administrators, or the Australian prime minister, or even Djokovic himself, who have responded to the situation surrounding their fellow competitor in the most measured and thoughtful way. Take Nadal, widely agreed to be one of the tour’s natural diplomats, whose initial summary of the mess his rival found himself in was devastatingly simple. “If he wanted he would definitely be playing here without a problem,” said Nadal, with a not unfeeling shrug. “Everybody is free to take their own decision – but there are some consequences, no?” At a time when much of what was flying around was invective, here was a quiet helping of truth. And while it was clear where he stood on the subject, it was also clear this wasn’t personal and that he felt sorry for the tough situation Novak had ended up in. When the reigning Australian Open champion was finally freed to enter the draw, Nadal backed the process that had got him there and wished him luck, because “whether or not I agree with Djokovic on some things, justice has spoken”. Most players questioned about Djokovic showed a similar willingness to blend sympathy for what a friend and fellow athlete was going through with an equally strong message about the importance of being vaccinated. Andy Murray, always one to speak his mind, saved his waspish observations for Nigel Farage, who was visiting Djokovic’s family: “Please record the awkward moment when you tell them you’ve spent most of your career campaigning to have people from eastern Europe deported.” For the world No 1, however, there was genuine concern – “it’s positive that he’s not in detention any more” – alongside a typically expressive sigh. Murray refused to offer any opinion until Djokovic had had the opportunity to answer questions surrounding his Covid tests and Murray’s brother, Jamie, was only a little more wry. “If it was me that wasn’t vaccinated I wouldn’t be getting an exemption,” he said, while his GB teammate Liam Broady failed to hide his laughter behind his hands. “But well done to him for getting cleared to come to Australia and compete”. The locker room on the tennis circuit is a truly unique sporting, working and living environment. Often, it gives the impression that it’s peopled with frenemies, rivals bent on learning and exposing each other’s weaknesses, while forced to spend time together to the extent that they become an intermittent but not altogether comfortable family. It is a place where you must fend for yourself and the only people who can empathise with your circumstances are the very ones challenging you. While outsiders have been quick to use Djokovic as a totem, whether for personal freedoms or border control, it’s those who actually play against the man who can best fathom what he’s going through right now. This episode has shone a light on the kind of respect and patience that helps their community to function. To them, Djokovic is neither an abstract representation of the age of disinformation nor a vegan super-saviour fighting injustice one tennis tournament at time (although his own father has called him Spartacus). He is an athlete who pushes himself hard, loves his sport, enjoys their company. They can like, admire and feel for him while maintaining a firm belief that Covid safety matters. Unlike team sports, where coaches, managers and captains can (and arguably should) impose some leadership on their players to ensure everyone’s safety, the worlds of individual sports such as tennis, golf or snooker or athletics rely on peer-to-peer relationship. Djokovic is, in fact, an outlier on the ATP tour; 97 of the top 100 players are vaccinated and vaccination take-up across professional tennis improved dramatically after the Australian Open made it mandatory. What his fellow athletes have done, in effect, is to model the way to deal with this issue in our own communities – with personal generosity towards those who can’t or won’t share our views, while we maintain an open, unexasperated commitment to science and fact. Every one of us has friends, family or colleagues with their own intransigent views on why they won’t take the vaccine. Everybody is free to take their own decision – but there are some consequences, no?
