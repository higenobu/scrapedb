4/13/2022,"Héritier Lumumba says he and two fellow former Collingwood players have severed ties with the AFL club because “nothing has changed” in the 15 months since a damning report commissioned by the club found a culture of “systemic racism” within its walls. The premiership player, whose allegations of racism during his time at the club from 2004 to 2015 sparked the independent investigation which resulted in last February’s Do Better report, announced he, Leon Davis and Andrew Krakouer would no longer engage with the Magpies as they attempt to implement the report’s recommendations. Davis and Krakouer have also previously alleged they experienced racist incidents at the club. “After 15 months of dialogue to address past incidents of racism at the Collingwood Football Club, Leon Davis, Andrew Krakouer and I have formally notified the club that we are officially terminating all communications with CFC,” Lumumba tweeted on Wednesday. “Nothing has changed. It is our firm belief that the Collingwood Football Club has no intention of acting in good faith to achieve a just outcome for past players who have experienced racism at the club.” Neither Davis or Krakouer have commented publicly. Collingwood has been contacted for comment. Lumumba’s social media post comes two weeks after the authors of the Do Report said the Magpies had made “significant and genuine progress” in addressing issues with historical racism. In their 12-month review of the club, Professor Larissa Behrendt and Professor Lindon Coombes also reported that “full implementation has not been reached”. “It is clear by the work that has been done by the club ... that there is a commitment within Collingwood to ensure that Do Better isn’t gathering dust on a shelf,” they wrote. “There is movement towards a more inclusive culture and an anti-racist framework for Collingwood, though it is important to acknowledge that real cultural and structural change requires continued focus, resourcing and integration.” The club moved quickly to demonstrate a commitment to progress last February after a hugely damaging week during which former president Eddie McGuire said the release of Do Better’s findings marked a “proud” day for the club. Days later, having conceded he “got it wrong” and did not mean to suggest that the club was proud of past incidents of racism, he stood down but reiterated his view that the Magpies were not a racist club. At the time Lumumba said the report vindicated his concerns but that the club’s response to it was “shameful”.",Sport/Sport,Héritier Lumumba ends all contact with Collingwood over response to racism allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/13/heritier-lumumba-ends-all-contact-with-collingwood-over-response-to-racism-allegations
4/13/2022,"“Hello & kia ora & g’day & welcome” a sign waved at Auckland’s international airport said on Wednesday morning as Australian travellers set foot on New Zealand soil for the first time since the short-lived travel bubble between the two countries abruptly ended in mid-2021. More than 4,000 people travelling from Australia on Air New Zealand flights are expected to arrive at Auckland and Wellington airports on Wednesday, after the Covid-19 border restrictions lifted at midnight. Vaccinated Australians and permanent residents can enter New Zealand with no other requirements than to self-test for Covid-19 on arrival. Wednesday marks the first step in re-welcoming international visitors back to the country – a long wait for many, which was evident as family and friends greeted arrivals with tears and embraces, to the backdrop of waiata (Māori song). Constanza Munoz told national broadcaster RNZ she had been waiting for her sister’s arrival at the airport since 4am. “I couldn’t sleep last night, I am very excited, I am shaking.” Munoz said many members of her family were still to meet her daughter, born in 2020, and she had been dreaming of this moment for a long time. Jenny Macks and her two daughters, Emily and Brianna, wept after a two-year wait to see one another. Speaking to news website Stuff, they said the time had been tough and their reunion was “ a long time coming”. For almost two years, the arrival terminals at New Zealand’s international airports have been desolate. Apart from a short-lived travel bubble with Australia, the country’s borders have been closed, with those lucky enough to secure entry into the country whisked to government-managed isolation and quarantine facilities for a costly two weeks secluded in a hotel room. An earlier border reopening announcement in 2021 was derailed by the arrival of Omicron. The quarantine restrictions were lifted in early March for New Zealanders returning home. All other international visitors will be allowed to enter New Zealand from October, unless the government decides it is safe to do so earlier. On Wednesday, the government announced that the entire country would move down Covid-19 alert levels, from red to orange, as cases within the community continue to drop. The change in setting means there are no longer limits on indoor or outdoor gatherings, and face masks will not be required at schools, though they are still encouraged. Masks will still be required on public transport and flights, as well as within close-proximity businesses including hairdressers. Air New Zealand said it was putting on 96 extra trans-Tasman flights from April-June to cope with demand. Its chief customer and sales officer, Leanne Geraghty, said: “This is the first step in welcoming international visitors back to our shores and we couldn’t be more excited for both New Zealand and Air New Zealand.” The tourism industry is fizzing with the possibility of returning Australian visitors. Pre-Covid, Australia was the largest tourism market, accounting for 39.6% of New Zealand’s international visitor arrivals. Rebecca Ingram, the chief executive of Tourism Industry Aotearoa, said: “There’s definitely a more positive feeling about the future and the opportunities to rebuild businesses.”",News/World news,‘Couldn’t sleep last night’: joy at New Zealand airports as Covid travel ban on Australians lifts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/couldnt-sleep-last-night-joy-at-new-zealand-airports-as-covid-travel-ban-on-australians-lifts
4/13/2022,"A gunman wearing a gas mask filled a crowded New York subway car with thick black smoke from a canister and opened fire on morning rush-hour passengers, injuring more than 20, including 10 with gunshot wounds. A manhunt was under way on Tuesday after the shooter fled the scene. A 9mm semi-automatic handgun and extended magazines, a hatchet, a black garbage can, detonated and undetonated smoke grenades and a key to a U-Haul van were also found at the scene, authorities said. Officers located the vehicle, which will be examined by a bomb squad. Injured passengers suffered from bullet wounds, smoke inhalation and the physical effects of panic. Nobody was reported to be in life-threatening condition. Joe Biden said on Tuesday afternoon: “We’re not letting up until we find the perpetrator.” He thanked professional first responders and civilians who rushed to help their fellow travelers amid the panic. The US president spoke at an event in Iowa, as the New York mayor, Eric Adams, indicated the authorities were getting ready to share the identity of the gunman, who was still at large. Authorities later identified Frank James, 62, as a person of interest in connection to the shooting. James rented the U-Haul van in Philadelphia and has addresses there and in Wisconsin. As of late Tuesday night, officials had no one in police custody. A $50,000 reward has been offered for any information in the incident. On Tuesday morning, graphic photographs and clips posted on social media showed the traumatic scenes on the platform of 36th Street station in the Sunset Park neighbourhood of Brooklyn around 8.30am. Wounded passengers were seen lying as others administered tourniquets to staunch bleeding from their legs. Another phone image showed blood smeared inside the train carriage and out on to the platform, indicating where a rider had been dragged to safety. Footage captured passengers screaming as they scrambled to escape the shooter. Biden added that he and the first lady, Jill Biden, were “praying for all those touched by this trauma”. In a press conference, the New York city police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, described events that began shortly before 8.24am as an N train bound for Manhattan was travelling between the 59th and 36th Street stations. “An individual on that train donned what appeared to be a gas mask,” Sewell said. “He then took a canister out of his bag and opened it.” Sewell continued: “The train at that time began to fill with smoke. He then opened fire, striking multiple people on the subway and in the platform.” The commissioner said there was no known motive for the actions of the suspect. She sought to calm nerves among New Yorkers by saying the shooting was not being investigated as an act of terrorism, but she later said she was “not ruling out anything”. Agents of the joint terrorism taskforce were at the scene, along with FBI and NYPD officers. Biden and the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, were briefed. The attack brought fear and chaos to New York City. Witnesses said they had heard so many shots they lost count. Others said the shooting sounded like fireworks or popping, causing confusion among passengers. Yav Montano, who was inside the carriage as the attack unfolded, shared with CNN a 10-second video he had captured as the train drew into the 36th Street station. People could be heard groaning and coughing and were seen covering their faces against thick smoke. Montano said a smoke grenade had been let off about two minutes before the train reached the station. Noise erupted and he crouched to the floor in an attempt to shield himself. “I didn’t realise it was shooting to start with,” Montano said. “It sounded like firecrackers, or a bunch of scattered popping.” Montano estimated there had been 40 to 50 passengers in the carriage. “There were some people whose pants were covered with blood,” he said, adding that there was blood on the floor. “All I saw was people trampling each other, trampling over each other, trying to get into the door, which was locked, and just a lot of panic.” The passenger said the train had slowed to a halt shortly before it reached the 36th Street station. “That’s when the chaos happened. Thank goodness the train moved, because I don’t know what would have happened otherwise,” he said. Other graphic footage was recorded as the N train pulled in. As its doors opened, smoke poured out, followed by passengers, some screaming, others stumbling and falling to the platform. Phone images showed blood on the floor of the car. Later, there were reports that the gun had been found, a Glock pistol, which had jammed during the incident, amid reports that the investigation was hampered by station security cameras not functioning. New York has been grappling with high-profile violent incidents on the subway, prompting the relatively new mayor to beef up police patrols. Adams, who is self-isolating with Covid, said: “We will not allow New Yorkers to be terrorised, even by a single individual.” Kathy Hochul, the governor of New York, told reporters: “We say: ‘No more.’ No more mass shootings, no more disrupting lives, creating heartbreak for people. We are sick and tired reading headlines about crimes. It has to stop.” As the manhunt got under way, officers fanned out across the Sunset Park neighbourhood, a largely working-class area with large populations of Hispanic and Chinese descent. Schools were put on lockdown. New York fire officers said they were looking at up to four undetonated devices, but later confirmed there were no active explosive devices. At least 21 injured passengers were treated at NYU Langone hospital –Brooklyn, said a facility spokesperson, Lacy Scarmana. As of Tuesday afternoon, 10 had been discharged, with 11 remaining in relatively good condition, Scarmana said. A statement from New York-Presbyterian hospital said staff there treated three other people injured in the morning’s subway shooting. All were in relatively good medical condition as of Tuesday afternoon, a hospital spokesperson, Tony Chau, said in a statement. Fire officials said they had taken 17 victims, including those with gunshot wounds, from the scene of the subway attack to local hospitals. Five were reported to be in critical but stable condition. Others arrived at those facilities on their own.
