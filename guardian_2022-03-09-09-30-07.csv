3/9/2022,"The Reserve Bank says a rise in the official cash rate this year is “plausible” and it may have to act decisively if supply shocks from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other shortages start to lift inflationary expectations in Australia.In a speech to an Australian Financial Review summit on Wednesday morning, the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, said Australia’s economy was relatively well-placed to ride out the war-related supply disruptions because the country exports “many of the commodities whose prices are rising”. Despite financial markets and some economists predicting the RBA will raise its cash interest rates from a record low 0.1% as soon as July, if not earlier, Lowe reiterated that the bank was in no hurry to move.“The recent lift in inflation has brought us closer to the point where inflation is sustainably in the target range [of 2% to 3%],” he said. “So too have recent global developments. But we are not yet at that point.” With wages picking up, “it is plausible that the cash rate will be increased later this year”, he said, adding that the invasion of Ukraine had added to uncertainties. There are two issues that could prompt the bank to move earlier: the persistence of supply-side shocks from the Covid pandemic, the extent “developments in Ukraine add to these supply-side inflation pressures” and how labour costs in Australia evolve. “Prior to the war in Ukraine, there was some evidence that the supply-side issues in the global economy were gradually being resolved,” Lowe said. “This new supply shock will extend the period of inflation being above central banks’ targets,” he said. “This runs the risk that the low-inflation psychology that has characterised many advanced economies over the past two decades starts to shift. “If so, the higher inflation would be more persistent and broad-based, and require a larger monetary policy response,” Lowe said, adding that any shift in inflationary expectations would be “critical”. “The Reserve Bank will respond as needed and do what is necessary to maintain low and stable inflation in Australia,” he said, underscoring the bank’s readiness to lift rates faster than planned if necessary. As for wage growth at home, the latest data indicates the rise “remains modest”, he said. The wage price index increased by 2.3% last year, with the broader measure including bonuses increasing by 2.8%, or less than the headline consumer inflation rate of 3.5%.

Still, rising oil prices “will eat into household budgets, push up costs for many businesses and crimp spending in some areas”. “Given this, I expect that most of this extra national income will be saved, rather than flow through into higher spending,” Lowe said.",News/Business,"Interest rate rise ‘plausible’, RBA says, eyeing supply shocks from Ukraine invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/interest-rate-rise-plausible-rba-says-eyeing-supply-shocks-from-ukraine-invasion
3/9/2022,"The last surviving 100% record in this season’s Champions League disappeared at Anfield along with Liverpool’s 28-game unbeaten home run, a sequence stretching back one year and one day, and yet it was a night of reward for Jürgen Klopp. A place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League is the prize that matters, and sufficient to console the Liverpool manager following a 1-0 defeat by Internazionale, but the resilience shown against the Italian champions will also offer compensation as the business end of the season approaches. Praising Liverpool’s defensive work may seem strange on a night where the main talking points were Alexis Sánchez’s debatable dismissal and a superb finish from Lautaro Martínez, the striker profiting from a loose clearance by Joël Matip and Virgil van Dijk backing off as he shaped to shoot into the top corner from distance. “That shouldn’t have happened,” the Liverpool manager said. But as well as Inter performed at Anfield, and as open as the last-16 second-leg contest was at times, Liverpool limited the visitors to precious few opportunities to recover the tie with and without a full complement of players. In terms of organisation and individual effort, Klopp’s defence provided the platform for a merited place in the last eight for a fourth time in five years. Liverpool started as they finished against West Ham on Saturday; a little laboured, lacking their characteristic intensity and quality distribution. High winds, often Klopp’s bugbear, may have been a factor but Inter had few issues with the conditions. They opened with a confident swagger. Nutmegs, backheels and deft chips were a feature of their first-half performance – sometimes all in the same move – as Simone Inzaghi’s team attempted to chase down a 2-0 deficit with a touch of Milan style. It was the power and movement of Michail Antonio and West Ham’s quality on the counterattack that tested Liverpool defensively at the weekend. In his Champions League programme notes, Klopp attributed the 1-0 victory to his team’s humility and greater desire. “They wanted it like crazy,” he said of West Ham, “but we wanted it even more.” David Moyes may beg to differ having seen Pablo Fornals and Manuel Lanzini squander a couple of sitters. Here, as at the San Siro, it was Ivan Perisic’s penetrating runs behind Trent Alexander-Arnold and Denzel Dumfries’s adventure on the opposite flank that offered Inter hope. Also in keeping with the first leg, however, Inter’s impressive buildup ultimately created few problems for Alisson in the Liverpool goal. A routine catch from Dumfries’s tame half-volley and a more awkward save from Hakan Calhanoglu’s free-kick were the sum total of the Brazil goalkeeper’s interventions before the break. West Ham created more trouble for Alisson. The Liverpool keeper received better protection from his defenders as a unit than he did at the weekend, when individual recoveries were crucial to his clean sheet, though had every reason to question the lapses that denied him a repeat against Inter. Matip was straight back in the starting lineup after recovering from illness and straight into his stride as the unsung foil to Van Dijk. Matip made two important early clearances as Sánchez and Martínez roamed inside the Liverpool penalty area. He almost made his presence felt in the Inter box with a header that smacked the face of Samir Handanovic’s crossbar with the visiting keeper rooted to the spot. Matip’s chance marked the start of Liverpool’s improvement, following a break in play for a medical emergency on the Kop. It was no coincidence that Alexander-Arnold began to make his presence felt in the final third when the game restarted. The Liverpool right-back had been occupied defensively by Perisic up to that point. He was kept on the back foot but displayed good awareness and upper body strength to prevent Martínez breaking clear into the area following Sánchez’s neat dummy. Liverpool lead the way for set-piece goals scored in the Champions League this season and Alexander-Arnold almost helped extend the tally. It was his free-kick that Matip glanced against the bar. Seconds later his corner picked out Van Dijk’s run to perfection inside a crowded box. The Dutchman gave a rueful smile as Milan Skriniar inadvertently deflected his header wide. Liverpool were disciplined and structured in the face of Inter’s counterattacking and smart movement. The decisive goal, decisive only in the context of the game, came from the hosts’ only serious lapse when Matip’s attempted clearance was cut out by Perisic and turned on to Martínez by Sánchez. Van Dijk appeared to be inviting Mártinez to shoot from an improbable angle. The risk backfired as the striker brilliantly found the top corner. Mártinez could have opened the scoring moments earlier but Andy Robertson read his intentions inside the area and made a vital block to deflect a shot wide. Matip also threw himself in the way of a drive from Calhanoglu as Liverpool kept Inter at a distance and defended in numbers when the situation demanded. Defeat will sting Klopp, it always does, but his team continue to fight their way through.",Sport/Football,Joël Matip showcases Liverpool’s defensive steel despite Inter defeat | Andy Hunter,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/joel-matip-showcases-liverpools-defensive-steel-despite-inter-defeat
3/9/2022,"The NSW Liberal party will have yet another attempt at resolving its remaining federal preselections with a proposal to hold branch votes in Hughes, Parramatta and Eden-Monaro, where more than one person is running, and to endorse candidates in two other seats. Under the proposal, defence analyst Lincoln Parker, now the only remaining candidate, would be be endorsed for Warringah, while, in Dobell, cardiologist Michael Feneley would become the Liberals’ candidate. But where there is competition, there would be branch votes under the new Warrignah rules, introduced in 2017 to bring more democracy to the party. This includes in the winnable seat of Hughes in Sydney’s east, where former Young Liberal president Alex Dore was proposed by the Right faction to be parachuted into the seat, even though he does not live in the electorate and had not nominated. A “fax ballot”, which proposes a truncated timetable for the rank and file preselections, was sent out late on Tuesday night to the 25 members of the NSW state executive. The vote is at midday. It is unclear whether it will pass as it requires 90% support to change the rules to shorten the process, including allowing “tele-town halls”. The question of whether to proceed with plebiscites in accordance with the Warringah rules requires only 50% support. “It’s progress at least,” said one supporter. “Even if doesn’t pass it gives the federal executive something to work with.” Several earlier proposals for the state executive to step in and install candidates across winnable seats according to a deal drawn up between factional organisers failed to win support and helped spark a legal challenge in the NSW supreme court in the past fortnight. But some of the steam has been taken out of the issue after the federal executive of the party took over the NSW division for 72 hours and installed the three sitting members who were under threat from challenges. Sussan Ley, the environment minister, has been endorsed as the Liberal party candidate for Farrer, immigration minister Alex Hawke has been endorsed as candidate for Mitchell and Trent Zimmerman, a key figure in the moderates, is the candidate for North Sydney. This had been one of prime minister Scott Morrison’s key demands. The division has now returned to the control of the NSW state executive, which has until 25 March to complete the candidate selection process. The latest peace deal is being put forward by a moderate member of state executives, Sally Betts, the former mayor of Waverley, with the backing of some right members. But it is unclear whether it will have the support of factional leaders, including Hawke, the prime minister’s representative on state executive. With the federal election just weeks away, local Liberals are furious at not having candidates in the field to campaign against the ALP and independents who are running on platforms of strong local representation and climate change.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberals to vote on new preselection peace deal in attempt to break deadlock,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/nsw-liberals-to-vote-on-new-preselection-peace-deal-in-attempt-to-break-deadlock
3/9/2022,"Sydney Harbour has been ruled out as a site for the proposed new base for Australia’s nuclear-powered submarines, with officials insisting it was not viable because of “limitations on berth space and shore facilities”. Questions have been raised about how the Morrison government settled on the three potential sites it announced this week – Port Kembla in Wollongong, Newcastle and Brisbane – given that these were not among the top five options listed in a previous Defence review. A 2011 Defence report ranked potential options for a new east coast home port for submarines. The top three options were in Sydney Harbour, followed by two options in Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. The same study said it “would be impractical” to develop a future submarine basing capability at Port Kembla, noting it had previously been found to be “a small and congested harbour with little space for substantial expansion”. When asked by Guardian Australia to explain what had changed since that review, a Defence spokesperson said changes in commercial activity at Port Kembla had released a large pocket of land which was “now potentially suitable for creation of a new naval base”. Jervis Bay had been “discounted as it is a gazetted marine park”, the spokesperson said. The Garden Island defence precinct in Sydney Harbour, which already serves as the navy’s key operational base on the east coast, was also “not considered a viable long-term solution” for a permanent submarine base. “The site is constrained with limitations on berth space and shore facilities and suffers considerable encroachment,” the Defence spokesperson said. “Construction of dedicated submarine facilities at GIDP would exacerbate existing pressures and further limit expansion options.” Scott Morrison announced the three potential sites in a national security speech on Monday, even though the selection process will not be complete until next year. That sparked Labor accusations of a pre-election marketing “ploy”. Both the prime minister’s speech and the government’s subsequent press release contained ambiguous language about who precisely had settled on the three final sites, after Defence did “significant work” to review “19 potential sites”. “Three preferred locations on the east coast have been identified,” Morrison said. He did not explicitly state whether it was the department or cabinet ministers who had done the identifying, or whether the government’s decision was in line with Defence’s recommendations. The employment minister, Stuart Robert, told Sky News on Tuesday: “The national security committee of cabinet has worked through a range of options and narrowed it down to three.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning That committee is chaired by Morrison and includes senior ministers, including the defence minister, Peter Dutton, and the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. Robert is not listed as a member. But the Defence spokesperson told Guardian Australia each site had been “assessed against Defence’s evaluation criteria”. The factors included “access to exercise areas and proximity to industrial infrastructure and significant population centres to support personnel and recruitment”. The three options would be “subject to further review and consultation”, the spokesperson said. In Defence’s 2011 future submarine basing study, Newcastle port was ranked sixth and the Port of Brisbane eighth. That review said Newcastle’s strengths were “compromised by its isolation from any other naval infrastructure, its susceptibility to flooding, and its sometimes difficult harbour entrance”. Dutton was asked on Tuesday whether a Chinese state-owned corporation’s part-holding of the long-term lease over the port would affect the eventual decision on where to build the submarine base. “All of that would be taken into consideration,” he told the ABC. He bristled at any suggestion he and Morrison were at odds on the timeframe for deciding which submarine design Australia would adopt under the much-trumpeted Aukus partnership with the US and the UK. Dutton had said on Sunday the government would announce the selected boat “within the next couple of months”, sparking speculation this may occur before the federal election due in May. But Morrison ruled out making a decision before the election, noting that caretaker conventions were due to begin by April. The defence minister told the Nine Network: “I didn’t say it would be before the election. Of course the ABC and the Guardian and others have tried to spin it into that but that’s not the case.” The Labor party has offered its support for the Aukus, saying it accepts advice that the deteriorating strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific justifies the need for less easily detectible nuclear-propelled submarines. But Labor’s defence spokesperson, Brendan O’Connor, said the party was seeking a briefing on the east coast base plans. He said Morrison had “taken a leaf out of his marketing playbook by making an announcement about a decision that will be made in 2023”. Officials from the US and the UK have visited Australia in recent weeks. It is understood the three governments are examining the full set of requirements to allow for the delivery of at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines under Aukus. These include the submarine design, construction, safety, operation, maintenance, disposal, regulation, training, environmental protection, installations and infrastructure, industrial base capacity, workforce and force structure. While Morrison has previously said the first submarine was expected to be in the water by about 2040, Dutton has since argued the may be achievable sooner. The government has also foreshadowed a likely increase in visits by British and US nuclear submarines in the meantime.",News/Australia news,Sydney ruled out as nuclear submarine base – despite topping list of sites in Defence study,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/sydney-ruled-out-as-nuclear-submarine-base-despite-topping-list-of-sites-in-defence-study
