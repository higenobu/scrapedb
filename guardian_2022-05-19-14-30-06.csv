5/19/2022,"Victoria’s crisis-riddled triple zero system lacks agility to respond to emergencies and is besieged by a risk-averse culture, leading to “dire outcomes” for patients awaiting ambulances, according to an independent review of the service. The review - by former police chief Graham Ashton- found the state’s Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA) operates like a “corporate entity” rather than an emergency management service. The release of the review follows reports of at least 12 deaths – including four children – since October after triple-zero operators either failed to pick up or answer the call within the service’s benchmark times. The investigation found simple time-critical decisions had to be escalated through multiple levels of ESTA’s leadership until it reached “a person who felt empowered to make a decision.” “This type of delay is an example that typifies a culture not consistent with ESTA’s mission,” the report says. It concluded that failure in the systems often had “dire outcomes”, with the pandemic pushing ESTA’s workforce “to its limits.” The report recommended the service be integrated into the Department of Justice and Community Safety from next year and undergo a rebrand to become “Triple Zero Victoria” to signify faster call-taking is its primary responsibility. A new board of advisers will also be created, which will include members of Ambulance Victoria and Victoria Police to draw on their emergency services expertise. The Andrews government said it supported “in principle” all of the report’s recommendations and noted five were already underway. It said work on the remaining 15 recommendations would begin immediately, with call-taking and technology recommendations the most pressing elements of the report. The report also warned that low staff morale – due to the challenging and confronting nature of the role and pandemic pressures – would impact the service’s ability to boost recruitment to meet demand if left unresolved. Staff told the review the leadership team did not understand their issues, with Covid-19 and negative media coverage of the service exacerbating staff wellbeing concerns. “The reactive nature of service delivery means that there is a focus on ‘keeping the lights on’, rather than proactive improvement or innovation,” the report found. Separately, a review - by the inspector general for emergency management - will probe the unprecedented call volume the service faced during Covid. The state opposition has for weeks accused the Andrews government of keeping the report secret after it was received in March. Last week, the premier, Daniel Andrews, was pressed by reporters on whether he had read the full report but labelled the opposition’s attacks a “political game.” The emergency services minister, Jaclyn Symes, said the government would work with ESTA, emergency service organisations, unions and workers to ensure it got the reform right. “Victorians should have the confidence that when they call for help in an emergency, they will get it,” she said. The review, commissioned by the government last year, was not designed to investigate individual deaths but to consider broad structural reform of the call-service. It also followed reports of the authority’s call-system crashing and putting patient lives at risk. Earlier this month, the government handed down the state budget – with a $12bn health funding blitz to help repair the state’s overburdened health sector and clear deferred care that has built up over the pandemic. It included $333m for 400 extra ESTA call-takers. In March, the government also launched a recruitment campaign to hire 120 additional call-takers as part of a $115.6 million reform package.

5/19/2022,"Here’s a gotcha question for an intrepid journalist to put in the final moments of the campaign: Mr Morrison, Mr Albanese, why are you killing the Great Barrier Reef? Unlike other gotchas, the query wouldn’t simply test the leaders’ powers of recall. It would go to the issue most likely to puzzle historians of tomorrow, namely: why an election preceded by catastrophic fires and floods hasn’t centred on the future to which both parties are committing us. Scientists say that the LNP’s policies align with global warming of well over three degrees. In other words, according to the best available science, Scott Morrison’s policies mean catastrophic heatwaves becoming yearly events – and the end of the already-bleaching Great Barrier Reef. As for Labor, its plan equates to a two-degree increase, which would bring intense heat events every three years (rather than annually). Under Albanese, the reef will still die – though perhaps at a slightly slower rate. For those covering the election as a horse race, the similarity between the parties’ platforms effectively neutralises global warming as a controversy, which perhaps explains why journalists don’t bring to climate the ferocity we’ve seen unleashed over brain freezes and other gaffes. But if we’re to avoid the normalisation of the disaster, the coverage of the environment needs far more mongrel. In a remarkable recent investigation, the Guardian revealed the biggest fossil fuel companies around the world to be planning vast expansions of their operations, allocating an astonishing $103m each day for the rest of the decade to opening fresh sources of oil and gas. As Damian Carrington and Matthew Taylor write in this report, “these firms are in effect placing multibillion-dollar bets against humanity halting global heating,” with their investments only becoming profitable if governments fail to quickly bring down emissions. What makes these oil and gas majors so confident? Think about what happened after the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26). The invasion of Ukraine disrupted energy markets, boosted fuel prices, and sent world leaders scurrying for alternatives to Russian gas and oil. Joe Biden might have campaigned on climate action but, after Ukraine, he’s released massive quantities of crude oil from American reserves while urging companies to ramp up their production. That’s the context in which Matt Canavan, the LNP’s senator given to saying the quiet part loud, declared net zero by 2050 “all over bar the shouting”. Or consider the heatwave engulfing India and Pakistan. Over 1.5 billion people have been enduring temperatures above 45 degrees in what climate scientists called a terrifying glimpse of the future. “We are living in hell,” one resident of Pakistan’s Balochistan region told the Guardian. The extreme temperatures in what should have been spring scorched wheat crops, incinerated landfills, sent birds falling from the sky and killed untold numbers of people in both nations. Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s minister for climate, talks of an “existential crisis”, with scores of temperature-related emergencies throughout the region. Yet here’s the thing. The daytime temperatures pushing the limits of human survivability have made air conditioning a necessity – and the need for electricity has, in turn, spurred a significantly increased demand for coal. It’s a ghastly illustration of how the catastrophes created by fossil fuels can increase reliance on those same energy sources. The fossil fuel corporations aren’t bothered by pledges of future climate action – it seems to me they’re confident that, as the crisis spreads, cascading disasters will bring governments sidling back to comforting hits of oil, gas and coal like so many incorrigible junkies. That’s why, as well as interrogating climate projections, we need a focus on what politicians intend to do right here, right now. For instance, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, has repeatedly called on political leaders to cancel any future coal projects as the necessary first step to avoiding disaster. At Cop26, over 40 countries pledged an end to investment in new coal power generation and agreed to wind back the use of coal during the 2030s. The Morrison government, naturally, refused to sign – a stance that Albanese subsequently backed. In fact, both parties now promise to support new coalmines, something entirely at odds with the recommendations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an intergovernmental body of the UN. Of course, with global warming now so apparent, every politician must pay at least lip service to addressing it. Hence the need to hold their feet to the fire. Think about Tim Wilson, a man currently touting himself to the good burghers of Goldstein as an MP “protecting our precious environment”. Every time Wilson appears in public, journalists should confront him with his record, pointing out that, as director of climate change policy at the Institute of Public Affairs in 2012, he lauded the climate sceptic Ian Plimer as a “straight shooter” and, separately, urged the abandonment of the Kyoto treaty, arguing Australia was shouldering an unfair burden after other countries abandoned the deal. Wilson was recently quoted in the Age as saying he has always had an “open mind” on climate science and “like everybody I’ve been on a journey with this. I’m not trying to pretend otherwise.” Does that mean he now thinks that he was wrong? If so, let’s hear him apologise. Or has Wilson calculated, like the fossil fuel companies themselves, that today airy environmental promises will serve him better than Plimer-style denialism? Nor should Wilson’s main challenger, Zoe Daniel, escape scrutiny. To their credit, Daniel and the other independents have put climate front and centre in their campaigns. Yet the teal project depends on presenting a platform sufficiently moderate for voters who once might have plumped for a Liberal wet. As Allegra Spender, the independent running for Wentworth explained, “[this seat] is not radical and I am not a radical at all.” On that basis, the veteran journalist Barrie Cassidy tweeted about the prospect of “inserting women from the sensible centre” into the political process. That would make more sense had the Australian climate debate been polarised between two equally misguided extremes. But that’s not the problem at all. On the contrary, the major parties stand shoulder-to-shoulder behind commitments at odds with what the IPCC says we require. We’ve had plenty of “sensible centrism” – climate action now depends on a willingness to fight. On paper, the teals’ pledges look much better than those offered by the majors. They’d theoretically allow parts of the Great Barrier Reef to survive. But implementing their program would mean taking on the fossil fuel lobby that’s captured the major parties. It would mean a battle against the corporate giants that are betting on humanity’s failure. Are the teals prepared for that kind of struggle? Maybe that’s a rude question. But in the last days before a crucial climate election, we can’t worry about being polite. In a decade’s time, no one will care whether Albanese could recite all six points of a Labor policy. But, unless something changes, the blackened, dead coral off the coast of Queensland will provide a permanent reminder of the choices made in 2022.

5/19/2022,"At this time of year the booming call of the bitterns resonates across the Avalon Marshes in Somerset while hawks skim over the reed beds and great white egrets nest in the shallows. The pools and ditches are alive with rare reptiles, mammals, insects and spiders. Plans to improve the habitat for flora and fauna that live in one of the UK’s most extraordinary landscapes by creating a “super nature reserve” stretching from these marshes around Glastonbury to the edge of Bridgwater Bay were announced on Thursday. The idea of the 15,000-acre Somerset Wetlands National Nature Reserve (NNR) is to knit together six protected sites and myriad other spots managed by a string of organisations and individuals to create a bigger and better protected area for some of the UK’s rarest wildlife. Tony Juniper, the chair of Natural England and the former executive director of Friends of the Earth, hailed it as an important moment. “It presents a practical demonstration of what can be done by working in partnership across the landscape at scale to reverse nature’s decline,” he said. “Natural England intends to encourage other projects with similar ambition. These wonderful places are needed now more than ever, as we face into the challenges of global warming, wildlife decline and reconnecting people with the natural world.” England’s first “super reserve” was launched in 2020 – shortly before the first lockdown – in Purbeck, Dorset, a mosaic of heaths, woods, mires, reed beds, salt marsh and dune. The idea is that by combining disparate chunks of land, a more dynamic landscape that is easier to manage in a more natural way – and much simpler for wildlife to navigate through – is created. In Somerset, this means linking the Ham Wall reserve, home to otters and water voles with lovely views of Glastonbury tor, in the east to Steart Marshes, one of the most important spots in the UK for waterfowl, in the west. In between is the Parrett valley, where farmers and graziers will be encouraged to work in ways that are better for nature and the environment. Julie Merrett, senior reserves manager in Somerset for Natural England, who enjoys listening to the boom of the bittern, a type of heron once extinct as breeding birds in the UK, from her desk at Avalon Marshes HQ, reeled off a list of birds and animals that the project is intended to benefit. Birds include the avocet, marsh harrier and skylark. The project should also be a boost for the hairy dragonfly, raft spider, silver diving beetle, adder and great-crested newt. One key aspect of the project will be working with the Environment Agency and other partners to improve the way ditches, streams and other waterways link the various areas, making it possible for wildlife to move around the super reserve. Because the area is the second largest area of lowland peat in the UK, it is also hoped that the project will boost the amount of carbon stored and another ambition is to improve access, getting more people into the landscape. Rosie Hails, the director of nature and science at the National Trust, one of the project partners, said: “The huge challenge posed by the twin climate and nature crises is such that ambitious solutions are urgently needed at scale.” The announcement of the super reserve comes on the 70th anniversary of the creation of England’s first six national nature reserves, which included Kingley Vale in Kent and Holme Fen in Cambridgeshire, on 19 May 1952. There are now 219 and a “festival of nature reserves” is planned this summer.",News/Environment,Somerset ‘super nature reserve’ will benefit UK’s rarest wildlife,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/somerset-super-nature-reserve-will-benefit-uk-rarest-wildlife
5/19/2022,"One swallow does not, proverbially, make a summer – and this year, birders all over the UK were struggling to see any at all, at least until the last week of April. This was largely because of a run of persistent north-easterly winds, along with bad weather in southern Europe, which delayed the arrival of many long-distance migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. The urban equivalent of the largely rural swallow – the swift – was also very late, at least compared with recent years; in London, the main arrival of swifts occurred in the first week of May, when they could finally be heard screaming above the city’s rooftops. Spring migration is a prolonged affair: short-distance migrants such as the blackcap and chiffchaff, which mainly overwinter in Spain and north Africa, have been singing in my Somerset garden since March; but spotted flycatchers, which spend our winter in west Africa, have yet to arrive. One major fear is that as springs shift earlier and earlier, birds may struggle to adapt to this dramatic change. The long-term study of great tits in Wytham Woods near Oxford showed that these resident birds are now laying their eggs three weeks earlier than they used to; but that option is simply not available for many migrants, which time their return to the UK using changes in light, rather than temperature.",News/Environment,Why migratory birds have been late to UK skies this spring,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/migratory-birds-late-spring-uk
5/19/2022,"In the late 90s, there was a fear that a new generation who had never known a pre-Roe world was unaware of the threat that abortion might once again become illegal in the US. A group of pro-choice activists came together with the imperative to push back against the notion that abortion rights were sacrosanct, and to motivate women to remain passionately engaged in the pro-choice struggle. Their great fear was that, with people turning their attention to other battles, the enemies of Roe might gain the upper hand. Starting in 1998, the group – including Naral, Planned Parenthood and the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice – began running ads warning of a dystopian future where Roe v Wade would be overturned. With vivid images, zeitgeist design and provocative language, the ad campaign was difficult to miss. “If I don’t get under your skin and if I don’t push your buttons in some way, I’m just putting some paper out there,” says Ellis Verdi, president of Devito/Verdi, the agency that created the ads. “I need you to fight me in order to reduce your apathy.” Using the imagery associated with backstreet abortions such as wire hangers and beat-up cars, the ads attempted to embody a bygone era. One image read: “Per order of the supreme court, any female who enters into a marriage shall be considered the property of her husband.” Another, with a design nod to Barbara Kruger, showed an image of a young woman with tattoos and piercings, warning, “Think you can do whatever you want with your body? Think again.” Now, with the court seemingly poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the ads seem chilling and prophetic. “My high school had the most pregnancies of any school in the country,” says Verdi. “In my teens I was arguing for daycare for these young women so that they could go to school. I actually won the argument and had the high school put in a daycare center. The biggest opposition was from the parents.” Verdi says the campaign also made a splash. The funders were extremely enthusiastic and financed the campaign’s three-year run in cities across the US. And on-the-spot interviews of subway riders pre- and post-exposure to the ads showed heightened interest and involvement in pro-choice issues. “I think everyone was feeling that, post–Roe v Wade, there was a tremendous increase in apathy,” says Verdi. “If you went to college campuses, the movement didn’t have the same support system. In an environment like that, you can pretty much assume it would be easier to pass legislation or overturn Roe.”",News/World news,‘Think you can do what you want with your body?’: vintage pro-choice ads – in pictures,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/abortion-pro-choice-ads-1990s

5/19/2022,"“There is a greater court now at Marble Hill than at Kensington,” the poet Alexander Pope wrote in 1735. Now, the historic Georgian villa in west London belonging to Henrietta Howard, the Countess of Sussex, is to reopen following decades of ruin. Though mainly known as King George II’s mistress, Howard was a remarkable woman in her own right, overcoming personal adversity to become a looming figure in Georgian court society and a member of a dynamic circle of writers and wits. Her home is one of the last survivors among the 18th-century villas and gardens that once bordered the Thames in an area around Richmond and Twickenham regarded as the “Hamptons” of the age. It stands as a rare example of a house built by and for a woman in Georgian England. The neo-Palladian villa was set in an “Arcadian” landscape, inspired by idealised representations of the gardens of ancient Greece and Rome. Howard co-created it with the advice of fashionable connoisseurs of the time, including Pope and Charles Bridgeman, later royal gardener to King George II. Once built, it became an idyllic retreat for her friends including Horace Walpole, John Gay and Jonathan Swift. The major reformation by English Heritage, supported by funding from the National Lottery, has reversed decades of disrepair. The charity has reinstated the interior paint scheme that existed at Marble Hill during Howard’s lifetime and conserved the fine collection of early Georgian paintings, including portraits of Howard’s circle. It has also restored and recreated some of the house’s furnishings including crimson silk wall hangings and an intricate carved peacock motif table (peacocks were the symbol of the ancient Roman goddess Juno, the protector of women). Also on display are a number of Howard’s personal items including a Chinese lacquer screen bearing her family’s crest and her prized collection of paintings by the Italian artist Giovanni Paolo Panini. Across the garden and 27-hectare (66-acre) riverside parkland, the villa’s grotto has been transformed to its 18th-century appearance, and previously inaccessible woodland areas have also been opened up. English Heritage reinstalled the serpentine paths and replanted the avenues of trees from the house to the river, “recreating the vista that the owner and her guests enjoyed”, and established wildflower meadows in the wider park. A ninepin bowling alley has also been restored following its excavation. “The restoration of Marble Hill has not only done justice to the house and gardens but to its owner, the remarkable Henrietta Howard,” said Kate Mavor, the chief executive of English Heritage. “This summer we’re inviting local people, Londoners, and everyone to discover – and enjoy – one of the forgotten gems of Georgian London.” Howard, who lost both her parents by the age of 12 and grew up in debt, did not have an easy life. Her first marriage to Charles Howard, the youngest son of the fifth Earl of Suffolk, was blighted by his drinking, gambling and abusive behaviour. In 1714, she was made woman of the bedchamber to Caroline, Princess of Wales, and soon after became mistress to the Prince of Wales – later George II. English Heritage said it would reframe Howard’s story as far more than just the king’s mistress, exploring her background and rise in Georgian society. “Her ability to navigate the vicissitudes of life is testament to her tenacity, intelligence and resourcefulness,” the charity said. Stuart McLeod from the National Lottery Heritage Fund said £5m had been donated to help restore the villa and gardens, on top of a £3m investment from English Heritage. “This ambitious makeover ensures the house at Marble Hill and park will be enjoyed by visitors and its local community for many years to come,” he said.",Arts/Art and design,Henrietta Howard’s historic Georgian villa to open to public after restoration,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/19/henrietta-howard-historic-georgian-villa-to-open-to-public-after-restoration-london
5/19/2022,"Bees and other pollinators will be the stars of this year’s Chelsea flower show, with many gardens demonstrating how to attract and protect them. Scientists have also developed a planter specifically designed with flowers that appeal to bees. Its designers say that if 50,000 gardeners planted just one container each, it would provide enough flower power to fuel 1m bumblebee miles every day, equivalent to an estimated 2m foraging trips. Bumblebees must fly from and to the nest multiple times each day to supply their colony with nectar and pollen. The flower combinations are important. The nectar provision of one potted lavender could enable a bee to fly up to 19 miles every day, but planted alongside marjoram and fiddleneck, it could fuel a day’s travel up to 40 miles. Among the pollinator-focused gardens is the Royal Horticultural Society and BBC flagship garden designed by Joe Swift, a presenter on Gardeners’ World. The Guardian visited him as he planted his garden ready for next week, and bees were already flocking to plants including alliums and foxgloves. Most of the plants in his garden appear on the RHS plants for pollinators list. Swift has urged gardeners to dig up their lawns and plant bee-friendly plants instead, with a path running through them. He told the Guardian: “I’ve never had a lawn; if my kids want to play football, they can go to the park. I’m always encouraging people to dig up their small lawns and just plant – it is much easier to look after and much better for wildlife.” The flower show has seen a trend towards natural-looking gardens full of pollinator-friendly plants in recent years, at odds with the stereotype of the neatly manicured traditional gardens the show was once known for. Swift said: “I‘ve been a designer for 30-odd years and there was a sort of minimal garden thing where it was all about shapes and maybe not enough flowers. Then there was a lot of hybridisation, people looking for the next fashionable plant, which wasn’t necessarily great for pollinators. Now we are thinking about the wildlife as well as planting a beautiful garden.” Another garden at Chelsea, by Bees for Development, shows how important the pollinators can be to poorer countries. It contains a market of products made by bees, and information about their pollinating power. The charity helps people in countries including Uganda and Ethiopia to become beekeepers, which can provide a stable income and help pollinate crops in areas that desperately need it. Emily Cullum, who works at the charity, said: “The people that we work with are often in places where it’s really hard to have a sort of stable income, particularly now there’s a lot of food insecurity and inflation is rising. It’s a really valuable way for them to have something that means they can keep earning a living. Honey is a luxury in those parts – it is sold by the teaspoon.” A rewilding-themed garden by design partnership Urquhart & Hunt showcases native plants that help rare pollinators including fritillary butterflies and solitary bees. Pointing at a clump of green stems, the designer Adam Hunt said they had planted devil’s-bit scabious even though it is not in flower yet. “At this time of year, it is a really important food source for the marsh fritillary butterfly. Most pollinators are quite generalist, whereas in the larval stage, caterpillar stage, they require very specific food sources.” The government has also announced a four-year plan for bees and other insects that will include funding for research into bee disease, financial support for beekeepers, and encouraging farmers to look after bees on their land. However, some may raise their eyebrows at this, as the government recently defied scientific advice by approving a pesticide known to be lethal to bees. The environment minister, Rebecca Pow, said: “We’ve got a million hectares in our gardens, and that could be a really, really valuable habitat for bees. I garden for wildlife myself – I leave corners of my garden wild and stopped mowing the lawn. I instead planted bulbs in it which flower at different times of year.” At Chelsea, the minister will be launching a new citizen science bee counting app, which is funded by Defra. She said: “You go out into your garden, and in your little patch, you identify which insects land on that patch in 10 minutes. It’s citizen science which will provide the data we need if we are going to reduce the decline in all of these species.” Blueberry, strawberry, chives Lavender, marjoram, fiddleneck Snapdragon, nasturtium, cosmos",Lifestyle/Life and style,Bee’s knees: pollinators are stars of Chelsea flower show,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/19/bees-knees-pollinators-are-stars-of-chelsea-flower-show
5/19/2022,"The budget neglects poor New Zealanders in favour of the “squeezed middle”, inequality experts have said, despite promises by Jacinda Ardern’s government to combat child poverty. Budget 2022 offered up a swathe of short-term sweeteners to soften the rising costs of living, including a $350 payment for people earning less than $70,000 but not on other benefits. “It’s designed to exclude some of the poorest New Zealanders,” said Max Rashbrooke, an economic and inequality researcher. Ardern campaigned on the promise to combat child poverty, and made herself the first minister for child poverty reduction in 2017. The government says all nine child poverty measures are trending downwards, resulting in 66,500 children being lifted out of poverty, but those working on the ground say in the nearly five years the government has been in power, the dial on poverty has barely shifted. A rule change, which would stop the crown raking back child support payments from parents on benefits, would lift another 6,000-14,000 children out of poverty, Ardern said on Thursday. “For decades, beneficiary sole parents have been denied money that is rightfully theirs by an outdated rule.” From July 2023, payments will be paid directly to the parent and charged as income, giving 41,550 parents about $24 a week extra in their pocket, at a cost of $354m to the government. Ardern said it would “encourage more parents to pay child support as they know it will go directly to their children”. Campaigners have fought for decades to get that policy changed, and Thursday’s announcement was a “big deal”, Rashbrooke said. But there is little else in the budget for the poor, he added, saying the government had lost its momentum on child poverty. “For all of Labour’s increases to core benefits, [beneficiaries] are still easily between $50 and $200 short a week of what they need for a life of dignity.” Child Poverty Action Group’s chief executive Laura Bond said “families locked into poverty will not see any relief from this year’s budget”. “Many families in the deepest poverty won’t be eligible to receive the new cost of living payment, leaving them with nothing extra, at a time when the cost of groceries and other essentials are soaring,” she said. Other funding announcements included an increase in dental care support from $300 to $1,000 a year per person, costing $125.8m, and widening the eligibility net for hardship grants. Over $100m will also go towards family and sexual violence services in New Zealand, which has one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence in the developed world. This is the fourth budget the government has put together using the “wellbeing approach”, which includes a broader range of outcomes to assess policy success, and first grabbed headlines in 2019.",News/World news,"Poorest New Zealanders lose out to ‘squeezed middle’ in budget, inequality experts say ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/poorest-new-zealanders-lose-out-to-squeezed-middle-in-budget-inequality-experts-say
5/19/2022,"The model boat, decorated with red, white and blue flowers, carried aloft by trainee sailors from nearby HMS Raleigh, processes through the crowded narrow streets of Millbrook. Town crier, mistress of ceremonies with garlanded staff, crowned king and queen drawn by a recumbent tricycle, sea cadet band, maypole and morris dancers proclaim the onset of summer. Overlooked by steep woods and sheltered from gales by Maker Heights, Millbrook Lake joins the Hamoaze (the estuary of River Tamar) opposite Devonport. The water here once served a fishing fleet, tidal mill, gunpowder factory, tannery, lime kilns, a brewery, rope walk and boat building. In the 19th century, apprentices built model boats to scale; if they sailed true, the boys could move on to next year’s apprenticeship. Each year the best boat was paraded, and this gave rise to the Black Prince Flower Boat procession, revived some 30 years ago after dying out before the second world war (the name Black Prince was popular for Cornish ships). Tidal water no longer reaches the old quay here, as the upper reaches were dammed in 1981 to protect against flooding. Come afternoon, the celebrations move across the Rame peninsula to the coastal villages of Cawsand and Kingsand, overlooking the breakwater that protects Plymouth Sound. Chiffchaff and wren clamour from the nearby curve of woodland, perhaps anticipating the drizzle that will freshen greenery and underlying bluebells after weeks of dry weather. Morris sides, moving between venues, include Cat’s Eye and Grimspound, dancing outside the Halfway House pub, which until 1844 was on the boundary between Cornwall and Devon. Cornish Wreckers perform their Rame dance on the Cleave, a little esplanade in sight of old fish cellars and the red rocks and cliffs that take you towards Fort Picklecombe. Far off Dartmoor is hidden in lowering cloud; spinnakers billow white through the mist as boats make headway from Penlee Point, passing the outgoing dark grey bulk of a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship. Weekenders drag wheelie cases away from their holiday cottages towards the car park. They will miss the launch of the Black Prince, off the beach into today’s calm, translucent water: “Goodbye, winter. Sail far away.”  Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",News/Environment,Country diary: A springtime parade of Cornwall’s naval history,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/country-diary-a-springtime-parade-of-cornwalls-naval-history
