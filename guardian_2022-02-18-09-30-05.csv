2/18/2022,"The British government has handpicked former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer to review the country’s border force, months after he urged the UK to adopt Australia’s controversial boat turn-back policy. British home secretary Priti Patel announced Downer, a key proponent of Australia’s Pacific Solution, would review the United Kingdom Border Force and examine the agency’s “structure, powers, funding and priorities”.  Unions in Britain were quick to condemn the appointment, which they described as “deeply concerning”, citing Downer’s role in Australia’s “inhumane” immigration policies. Asylum seekers arrived in the UK in record numbers last year, fleeing persecution by boat across the English channel. Many say they have no alternative but to make the hours-long journey across the channel because there are no alternative “safe and legal routes”, a criticism also aired by the French president Emmanuel Macron. Both Patel and Downer have advocated for harsher policies as a deterrent. Patel has suggested boats be “pushed back” to the French coast, a proposal that Downer supported in a piece for the Daily Mail in September, boasting of Australia’s policy of sending boats back to Indonesia. Downer said the suggestion people were fleeing France was “ridiculous”, saying his recent holiday experience in Dordogne which was “very civilised”. The border force review is expected to take several months to complete. “The public rightly expects this work to be carried out to the highest possible standard, which is why I have ordered this review of Border Force to identify ways in which it can keep improving its operations,” Patel said. Recent freedom of information data shows two-thirds of UK asylum seekers arriving by small boat after crossing the Channel were suffering from hypothermia. Hundreds more had petrol or saltwater burns sustained on the journey. The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), which covers Border Force staff, criticised the appointment of Downer as “deeply concerning”, according to UK media. “He was a prime architect of Australia’s inhumane immigration policy and his support for pushback recently makes him a wholly inappropriate choice to lead this review,” a spokesperson said. The issue has caused strain between France and the UK, with Macron suggesting Britain’s immigration system favours clandestine migration and makes it impossible for asylum seekers to find legal ways into the country. Patel described those comments as “just wrong”. The two nations blamed each other after a dinghy sank in November, leading to the deaths of 27 people. Downer has suggested the UK begin turning-back boats and give the French only limited information. “My advice to Miss Patel would be to introduce the ‘push-back’ policy without fanfare, and to keep the French informed on a need-to-know basis only,” he wrote last year. Downer said he planned to lead an evidence-based review of the border force. “I look forward to assessing Border Force’s structure, powers, funding and priorities, and hearing from a wide range of voices from across the organisation and beyond,” he said.",News/Australia news,‘Deeply concerning’: British government picks Alexander Downer to review UK’s border force,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/deeply-concerning-british-government-picks-alexander-downer-to-review-uks-border-force
2/18/2022,"A 24-acre fake lagoon constructed in the middle of the California desert will be at the heart of a new Disney-branded planned community, the company announced this week. Rancho Mirage, California, a city in the Coachella Valley not far from Palm Springs, will be the site of Disney’s first “Storyliving” community, the company said in a press release.  The new developments will be staffed with “Disney Cast Members” and offer Disney entertainment and activities, with the goal of creating “neighborhoods that are infused with the company’s special brand of magic”, the company said. Some neighborhoods will be designated as senior living communities for people over the age of 55. Plans at the site, chosen in part because Walt Disney himself owned vacation properties in the area, include a private waterfront club and private beach access for members, as well as some paid public access to the man-made beach. Storyliving is not Disney’s first attempt to translate the popularity of its theme parks and vacation resorts into a model for daily life. In the mid-1990s, the company developed Celebration, Florida, a community at the border of its Disney World resort, known for its rigid small-town Americana aesthetic and pre-scheduled fake snow. Celebration has since dealt with challenges, including the foreclosure crisis, a 2016 lawsuit by some residents over mold, leaks, and other overdue repairs, and the high-profile trial of a man accused of murdering his wife, three children, and their family dog inside their Celebration home in 2020. The town is no longer owned by Disney. While Rancho Mirage’s mayor said the Disney development was a “fabulous fit” and the project is estimated to bring the city more than $8m per year, an environmental expert said that constructing a giant lagoon in the middle of a parched desert landscape raised some obvious issues. “Having a large lake – 24 acres is big – in a very hot desert, in a state where we do not have a lot of extra water to go around, doesn’t make sense environmentally,” said Nicola Ulibarri, who researches water management at the University of California, Irvine. “In California, pretty much every drop of water is spoken for,” she said. “If you have water that is sitting in a lake and evaporating, it’s not going to provide drinking water for people, it’s not going down to a river where it’s providing a habitat for fish.” If the lagoon were constructed with recycled graywater, that would mitigate some of the environmental impact, she said. In a press release, Disney said it would build the lagoon “sustainably” and “with low water consumption and using a minimum amount of additives and energy”. The environmental impact report for the project, which was approved before Disney announced its involvement, said the development would reduce its “potential to substantially decrease groundwater supplies” by using recycled water and other strategies, The Desert Sun reported. The Coachella Valley is already the site of extensive water-intensive developments like golf courses and lush green retirement communities, Ulibarri said. The “Storyliving” announcement also raised questions of “equity,” since the Disney “Cotino” development is likely to be expensive and targeted towards higher-income retirees. “Not too far away from the Coachella Valley is the Salton Sea, which historically was a big lakefront resort. Now it’s evaporating more and more every year, and is creating huge health problems for the lower-income communities in that area,” she said. Dust from the evaporating Salton Sea is a major problem for local residents, and children in who live near the sea have higher rates of asthma. “You’re creating this wonderful amenity for this wealthy group, turning your back on the Salton Sea and all the problems it’s created there,” Ulibarri said. Twitter users have already embraced the “Storyliving” brand as a source of inspiration for jokes, many focused on an imagined dystopian future of the Disney community.

2/18/2022,"Dominic Raab has announced the creation of 4,000 new prison places in England and Wales, as the government plans for an increase of almost 25% that could take the prison population to an all-time high. There were 79,765 prisoners in England and Wales in the week ending 11 February, according to Ministry of Justice figures, while the maximum capacity in the system was 81,368.  The latest announcement of 4,000 new places, which will include extending or refurbishing 16 prisons, is part of a plan to provide 20,000 “innovative” new prison places by the mid-2020s. If all these were taken up, it would push the prison population to its highest ever level, above 100,000. The previous peak was 88,000 in November 2011. Prisons being extended or refurbished as part of the new announcement include Birmingham, Liverpool and Norwich. Projects have already been completed at four other prisons, including Feltham and Aylesbury. The Ministry of Justice is also planning to build six new prisons – with the department stressing the benefits for the local economy in terms of job creation. Raab, the justice secretary, said: “Our prison-building programme will deliver an extra 20,000 prison places by the mid-2020s to punish offenders, deter crime and protect the public. “We are also overhauling the prison regime, using prison design, in-cell technology, abstinence-based drug rehabilitation and work to drive down re-offending.” But the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, Alistair Carmichael, said the drive to build new prison places was an admission of failure. “The UK already has more people in prison than any other country in western Europe, and now the government is spending an extra £4bn because crime is rising,” he said. Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: “Endlessly making the same announcement about building new prison spaces is not going to solve the chronic failure of our prison system. For 30 years overcrowding and the continued use of prisons built in the 19th century have made a mockery of promises of reform. Nothing in the government’s plans changes that.” The government was censured by the Statistics Authority earlier this month, for misleadingly claiming that crime has been falling. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary, had both said crime had fallen by 14%. The figures refer to the period September 2019 to September 2021, but exclude fraud and computer misuse. Once these are included, crime actually increased over the period.",News/Society,"England and Wales to get extra 4,000 prison places in record expansion",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/18/england-and-wales-to-get-extra-4000-prison-places-in-record-expansion
2/18/2022,"Antonio Conte returns to the Etihad, a stadium that helped announce him to English football. Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat of Manchester City in December 2016 came midway through the 13-match winning run that seized control of that title race. Like Conte, Pep Guardiola was in his first Premier League season, and his team had no answer to Chelsea’s vigour and power. More than five years on and Guardiola is master of all he surveys, part of the furniture, commanding a bespoke, multifunctional squad. Conte has gained a reputation for blowing up and blowing out when all is not to his satisfaction. His Sky Italia interview this week was explicit in its opinion of Tottenham’s January transfer window. Conte taking on Guardiola in a battle between two of the game’s finest coaches should be an enticing prospect, but the Italian does not appear to believe his squad is capable of making it a contest. JB  Manchester City v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm The visit of Brentford to the Etihad gives Arsenal a chance to show how much things have changed since the opening day of the season, when Mikel Arteta apologised to fans following a 2-0 defeat. The side that Arteta picks on Saturday will be very different to the one that played back in August, not least because Bernd Leno is no longer first-choice goalkeeper, Callum Chambers has been sold and Pablo Marí and Folarin Balogun have left on loan. Aside from the quality that has been added since, Arsenal seem to have developed a grittiness that has served them well in recent weeks. With Brentford no longer as buoyant, this is a prime opportunity for Arsenal to take a step closer to Champions League qualification, a possibility that seemed far-fetched a few months ago. PD Arsenal v Brentford, Saturday 3pm Back from Abu Dhabi, Chelsea’s fans will doubtless celebrate their team’s new status as world champions, but questions remain over the two goalscorers against Palmeiras, Romelu Lukaku and Kai Havertz.. Lukaku’s header exhibited a quality of finishing that has been lacking since his return to England. Havertz, so calm with his deciding penalty, continues to be a man for the big occasion while inconsistent during the lower tariff assignments. Mason Mount will be missing with an ankle injury sustained at the Club World Cup so Thomas Tuchel needs more from Havertz, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic in a forward line packed with talent but short on magic. Palace, without a league win in 2022, may still be dangerous opponents, even if they have lost their last three matches to Chelsea, conceding 11 goals and scoring just one. JB Crystal Palace v Chelsea, Saturday 3pm Steven Gerrard has lost more matches than he has won as Aston Villa manager. There were redeeming qualities in the defeats to Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, but nothing to admire in last week’s awful performance at Newcastle. The centre-backs performed competently but their attackers were hardly involved, principally because Villa’s midfield allowed Jonjo Shelvey and Joelinton to run the show. That is damning of John McGinn and Douglas Luiz and helps explain why Gerrard was so keen to sign Brighton’s Yves Bissouma in January. Reinforcements will have to wait, so Gerrard needs to find another way to make his team consistently solid and dangerous. There should be a big improvement this weekend, especially as Watford at home is about as good a fixture as a team can get in the Premier League. PD Aston Villa v Watford, Saturday 3pm What does Allan really make of life at Everton? Rather than playing in sun-drenched Naples and competing near the top of Serie A, he finds himself on wintry Merseyside, teetering on the edge of a relegation scrap. The Carlo Ancelotti signing was asked to sit and protect the back four under the now departed Rafael Benítez, with few opportunities to attack. He is playing under his third Everton manager in Frank Lampard. The arrival of Donny van de Beek may be just the tonic. Allan has been far from consistent this season, like the rest of the team, but the pair impressed in midfield during last weekend’s 3-0 dismissal of Leeds. Newcastle sit just a point behind 16th-placed Everton and Southampton have lost once in 10 matches. Lampard and his men need a result at St Mary’s; Allan and Van de Beek achieving midfield harmony may go a long way to determining their fortunes. LM Southampton v Everton, Saturday 3pm Eddie Howe’s attempt to guide Newcastle to a fourth victory in a row has been complicated by injury to Kieran Trippier and possibly also to Javier Manquillo. The manager will be forced to change a winning lineup at least a little but the most interesting alteration may be voluntary: Bruno Guimarães has yet to start since joining in January. Newcastle’s other midfielders have responded to his arrival by improving their own performances but this weekend could be the ideal time to start the Portuguese as the visitors to West Ham attempt to subdue Declan Rice and Tomas Soucek. PD West Ham v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pm At Elland Road, Daniel James takes on the club that sold him in August a couple of weeks after he had played his part in Manchester United’s 5-1 destruction of Leeds on the season’s opening weekend. James’s two goals against Aston Villa in last week’s 3-3 draw were reminders what an effective player he can be. Manchester United received £25m for him but, despite their raft of attacking talent, appear to lack a player of his pace on the counter, even if Anthony Elanga has started to fulfil that role. James may not have the star quality of those who remain at Old Trafford but he is prepared to follow his manager’s instructions to the letter. Ralf Rangnick, bequeathed a group of soloists, might have found good use for a Welshman willing to give everything for the collective. JB Leeds v Manchester United, Sunday 2pm With Liverpool facing two league matches in four days on the back of a gruelling Champions League encounter at San Siro, Jürgen Klopp is likely to showcase his new squad depth. Klopp has hailed Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané as “forces of nature” and said they have recovered quickly from the Africa Cup of Nations exertions but Salah, in particular, looked tired against Internazionale, even if he scored his customary goal. To preserve his African stars for even bigger matches ahead, Klopp could afford to give Salah and Mané a rest this weekend, even if Diogo Jota is unavailable and the game against Norwich is no gimme. PD Liverpool v Norwich, Saturday 3pm Before last weekend’s 2-0 victory at Watford and Tuesday’s defeat by Manchester United, Brighton recorded three consecutive 1-1 draws in the Premier League. Burnley have drawn their past three. No one can match Brighton’s appetite for a draw; they have 12 this season, compared with 11 for Southampton, Crystal Palace and – that’s right – Burnley. A point isn’t really good enough for Sean Dyche and the Clarets. They sit bottom, seven points behind 17th-placed Newcastle and still with one league victory to their name. On the plus side, Wout Weghorst’s link-up play has been a positive since his transfer-window arrival, and Dyche expects the Dutchman to feature against Brighton despite picking up an injury last weekend. Burnley are unbeaten in their past five league visits to Brighton. Four of those were draws and eight of the past 12 league meetings have ended level. The smart money is on more of the same. LM Brighton v Burnley, Saturday 3pm There was an inevitability to West Ham’s late equaliser at Leicester. A set piece and injury time make a likely combination for the Foxes to concede from and Craig Dawson’s shirt sleeve delivered, such has become the soft underbelly of Brendan Rodgers’ defence. That Rodgers is no disciple of Giovanni Trapattoni-style catenaccio is no secret, the question is whether his problems organising a defence are down to his idealism or to incompetence. Pressure is beginning to grow on an Ulsterman who was very recently linked with vacancies at Tottenham and Manchester United. A keen note-taker during matches, perhaps his perpetual journey of self-improvement might take in watching the practices of Bruno Lage, his opposite number on Sunday. Wolves, who don’t score many and yet don’t concede many, are in the type of position Leicester would have expected to be before the season.
