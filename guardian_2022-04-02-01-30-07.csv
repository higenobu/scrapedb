4/2/2022,"A group of 2,000 people have made it to safety from the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol, as the success of the wider rescue operation for more than 100,000 trapped civilians still hangs in the balance. The 42-strong convoy of buses organised by the Ukrainian government and escorted by the Red Cross headed from the nearby Russian-occupied city of Berdyansk to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday afternoon, according to the Mariupol city council’s channel on the messaging app Telegram. Russian forces allowed the vehicles to pass, in what represented a small breakthrough after the failure of several previous evacuation attempts. Those onboard the buses had made it out of Mariupol to Berdyansk on their own, after which they were allowed to leave Russian-controlled territory. A further 631 people managed to leave Mariupol in private cars on Thursday night, the Ukrainian government said. Up to 170,000 residents remain hemmed in by Russian ground forces in the strategically important coastal city, which before war broke out last month was home to about 430,000 people. The Kyiv authorities reiterated on Friday that no aid or evacuation convoys had been allowed to reach Mariupol itself, despite reassurances from Russia on a limited ceasefire in the area, and it remains dangerous for the city’s residents to try to leave without assistance. Russian forces also seized 14 tons of food and medical supplies headed for Mariupol, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. “We don’t see a real desire from the Russians … to provide an opportunity for Mariupol residents to evacuate to territory controlled by Ukraine,” Petro Andryushchenko, adviser to the mayor of the city, wrote on Telegram. Mariupol has borne some of the worst violence of the conflict so far: incessant airstrikes and shelling have hit civilian infrastructure, including a maternity hospital, aid warehouse and arts centre sheltering displaced people. At least 5,000 people have died in the brutal assault, the Ukrainian president, Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Thursday, while electricity, water, food, fuel and medicine are running out. Ukraine has also accused Russian forces of shelling supposedly safe routes outside of fighting hotspots, which Moscow denies. Mariupol city council said on Friday that Russia’s actions in their bombed-out city amounted to genocide. On Thursday, Kyiv and Moscow agreed on a humanitarian corridor along the route from Mariupol to Berdyansk and then Zaporizhzhia for several hours at 10am (7am GMT) on Friday, but other than the the successful evacuation of the 2,000 people who had already made it to Berdyansk, by late afternoon little progress had been made. A bus convoy had not been able to approach the dividing line into Mariupol, International Committee for the Red Cross spokesperson Ewan Watson told reporters in Geneva, with complex logistics and instructions still being worked out and conveyed to military units on both sides. It was not immediately clear whether the convoy to which he was referring was the same that transported people from Berdyansk. Earlier in the week, the Kremlin said its goals in the “special operation” to “denazify” its neighbour had shifted to gaining complete control of the Donbas, where Mariupol is located and where Moscow-backed separatists declared two independent republics in 2014. Russian air and ground-launched missile attacks on Chernihiv, in northern Ukraine, and suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, have continued despite Moscow’s announced drawdown. Ukrainian forces said they had retaken the villages of Sloboda and Lukashivka, south of Chernihiv, on the main supply route to Kyiv, as well as carrying out limited counterattacks to the east and north-east of the capital. Peace talks aimed at ending the five-week-old war, which has killed thousands and forced 4 million Ukrainains to flee the country, resumed by video link on Friday. Significant progress did not seem likely, however, following the stalled Mariupol evacuation attempt and Russia accusations of a Ukrainian helicopter attack earlier in the day. The alleged gunship assault on an an oil depot on the Russian side of the border, in Belgorod, is the first such reported incursion of its airspace by Ukrainian forces. “Certainly, this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he could “neither confirm nor reject the claim that Ukraine was involved in this, simply because I do not possess all the military information.” Negotiations in Turkey earlier this week centred on Ukraine’s willingness to abandon its bid to join Nato. Kyiv also offered proposals to have its neutral military status guaranteed by a range of foreign countries.",News/World news,"Refugee convoy makes it out of Mariupol but 170,000 remain trapped in city under siege",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/refugee-convoy-makes-it-out-of-mariupol-ukraine
4/2/2022,"The Hollywood actor Sean Penn has called for a billionaire to come forward and buy two squadrons of F-15 or F-16 aircraft for Ukraine in an unlikely attempt to tip the scales against the Russian invaders in the five-week-old war. The actor’s plea for somebody to come and spend $300m on “12 aircraft with better tech than Russian MiGs or SU’s” mirrored a request a couple of hours earlier from Ukraine’s air force for US-made fighters. Although the role of arms middleman may be one to which Penn is not obviously suited, he has been engaged in filming a documentary about Ukraine and its charismatic president, Volodymyr Zelenksiy, for months. The Oscar-winning star of Milk and Mystic River was in Kyiv on the day the war broke out, pictured in the front row of a press briefing in the capital city, and met a tired-looking president later that day, according to an Instagram story released by Zelenskiy. Penn’s documentary team remained for some while after in Kyiv, working closely with government officials, and the actor appears to have come close enough to Zelenskiy and his circle to try to help source higher specification arms for Kyiv’s embattled forces. Filming for the Vice Media documentary has been going for some time, with Penn donning military gear in a visit to the Donbas frontlines in November – but Russian invasion on 24 February and Zelenskiy’s sudden global fame has made it a hot media property. Last week, Penn threatened to “smelt” his Oscar statuettes “in public” if Zelenskiy was not allowed to speak at last week’s Academy Awards ceremony – but the Ukrainian president, a former actor, did not get a platform to address the event. Ukraine has been asking for more fighters since the war started, but the US refused to support a deal that could have seen Poland supply 28 MiG-29s, a Russian-made jet of the type its remaining pilots are used to flying. Washington was concerned that supplying fighter jets could be deemed escalatory by a nuclear-armed Russia. Despite the refusals, Ukraine continues to press its case, and overnight its air force tweeted “the greatest need is for fighter jets” and asked specifically for F-15s and F-16s, whose original designs date back to the 1960s and 1970s, which it said its pilots could learn to fly with “just 2-3 weeks of training”. Experts said it would normally take pilots up to four months to learn how to fly a new fighter, and Ukraine would also have the problem of finding spare parts and engineers who knew how to maintain Boeing and Lockheed Martin-made aircraft. Ukraine’s air force – a tenth the size of Russia’s – had been expected to be knocked out of the skies within a few days of the invasion. But some of its fighters remain active and the airspace over the country remains sufficiently contested that Russia has not been able to carry out bombing missions freely. Andy Netherwood, a former RAF pilot and defence commentator, said: “If you’d have asked me at the beginning of the war, I’d have said it was impossible for Ukrainian pilots to learn how to master a new fighter in two to three weeks. But now I’m reluctant to use the word impossible when it comes to the Ukrainian air force.” However, a more serious obstacle to a billionaire buying F-15s and F-16s and flying them to Ukraine would be US export controls – major arms sales have to be approved by the US Congress before being allowed to proceed. “Typically fighter aircraft are sold by one government to another,” Netherwood added.",Arts/Film,Sean Penn calls for billionaire to step up and buy aircraft for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/01/sean-penn-calls-for-billionaire-to-step-up-and-buy-aircraft-for-ukraine
4/2/2022,"The LGBT+ community has lost trust in the government following the debacle over a ban on so-called conversion practices, with many seeing the exclusion of trans people as a hostile act, according to a leading campaigner. Jayne Ozanne, a former government adviser on LGBT+ issues, said the approach, announced on Thursday evening after a double U-turn, “left the most vulnerable group completely unprotected”. She added: “This debacle has set the Conservatives back 20 years in their relations with the LGBT community.” Conversion practices attempt to change or suppress a person’s sexuality or gender identity. On Thursday it emerged in a leaked briefing paper that Boris Johnson was shelving a pledge to outlaw them. But, faced with a backlash by campaigners for a ban and MPs from all parties, he U-turned again within hours. The government is now pressing ahead with making conversion practices illegal – though only relating to sexual orientation, not gender identity. This means the ban, to be introduced in the Queen’s speech in May, will cover gay and bisexual people in England and Wales but not trans people. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who also holds the equalities brief but was kept in the dark over the first U-turn, met with Johnson in Downing Street on Friday on returning from a trip to India. Her allies said she was relaxed with the government’s position following its second U-turn of the day. But LGBT campaigners said Truss was “livid” at the sequence of events, which came on the international day of trans visibility. Ozanne, who resigned from the government’s LGBT advisory panel in March last year in protest over foot-dragging on the promised ban, said excluding trans people from legislation was “a message of impunity” to those whose actions were harmful. “My fear is that the prime minister has succumbed to an anti-trans narrative when he should be protecting this very vulnerable group of people,” she added. Paul Farmer, the chief executive of Mind, said the mental health charity was “deeply disappointed to see that the UK government has chosen to exclude trans people from the ban on these harmful practices. The government’s own research suggests that trans people are much more likely to have undergone, or been offered, conversion therapy, so this exclusion simply makes no sense … We need a complete ban, without loopholes, which protects everybody.” The Conservative MP Alicia Kearns tweeted: “We cannot exclude our trans friends – why should quacks and charlatans be allowed to continue to cause life-long harm to them?” The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the government should “keep to its promises on this”. Instead it was “trying to get us all to talk about conversion therapy because they don’t want us focusing on the cost of living crisis”, he added. Supporting the government’s approach, Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at No 10, said including trans people could inhibit non-coercive discussions about complex issues of gender identity. “Doctors, therapists and parents would be deterred from exploring with a child any feelings of what else may be going on for fear of being told they’re trying to change a child’s identity,” she told the BBC. But Ozanne said that Da Costa was “confusing good healthcare practice with conversion therapy. The latter is about being told that you can only be straight or cisgendered, that you cannot explore who you are.” Ozanne said she had been inundated with messages of support from MPs of all parties who had “properly engaged with the issues”. Truss was at a dinner in India when the leaked document emerged, and boarded a flight back to the UK shortly afterwards. The government briefing paper said: “While Liz is not ideologically committed to the legislation she is likely to be concerned about owning the new position, having personally committed to delivering the bill.” Truss’s allies insisted she was happy with the government’s position. “It got us back to where she thinks we should be: with common sense carve-outs for freedom of speech, and to make sure we protect under-18s from making irreversible decisions on transgender,” said an aide.",News/World news,Conversion practices U-turns ‘set Tories back 25 years’ with LGBT+ community ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/conversion-practices-u-turns-set-tories-back-25-years-with-lgbt-community
4/2/2022,"This is a massive show. After two years of working on Zoom, we are finally in a room, with 15 live and kicking cast members, the writer Douglas Maxwell, composing team Roddy Hart and Tommy Reilly, designer Emily James and a gang of other fantastic humans. I am buzzing off the passion, eagerness and sweat of this gang. They are all like racehorses champing at the bit. Everyone just wants to do their job, properly, not from a cupboard at home, not in isolation, but with other sweaty creative balls of fire. We have had a full week just purely singing already. That was week zero. There are 22 songs, many with four or more part harmonies, and 13 dances. One of our leads, the brilliant Reuben Joseph, was off all through the singing week with Covid, so loomed on a large screen, picking up his harmonies as we went. But now he is here and slips in seamlessly. Peter Mullan is in the room. This is no small fact. Our show is based on his award-winning film of the same name, which became a cult classic. Peter is an icon to so many actors and directors here in Scotland. To the younger generation in the team, he’s that grizzly actor in Ozark; to the youngest, he’s that guy your mum gets a bit starstruck about. To most of us, he’s the artist you wanna be when you grow up. He watches intently, laughs his gravelly laugh a lot, and doesn’t seem to want to slay any of us at the end. Huge sighs of relief. Exciting developments in the dance sessions. Vicki Manderson is an incredible choreographer and has managed to turn a 1990s funfair, a knife scene played out against speeding cars and a man falling into a river into seamless choreographic magic. One of our actors is a wheelchair user, and it has been really fun playing with ways in which we can harness the individuality of that. Amy Conachan rocks her chair, spins on it and does wheelies as part of a poptastic song, One of Us. Paul Donnelly, the fight director, is fresh from filming Outlander and comes in and nails a huge bar fight in an hour or so. Paul waltzes off to go be some big Highland warrior again, and everyone catches breath. I’ve just done the school run when I see a text from the producer. One of our leads, Dylan Wood, has tested positive for Covid. So has another one of the cast. The understudies step up and start learning all the leads’ moves. We film every scene as we work through them, and send them to the cast who are off with Covid, so they can keep watching the updated details and get new moves in their heads. My other production is opening in Canada and I’m getting WhatsApp messages about the position of a skylight hanging above the set. I forget my daughter’s parents’ evening call is happening in the tea break. I feel like a terrible mum, and my brain is about to combust. We shoot a promo film in a church in the East End of Glasgow. All good, we are managing this. Rab Florence and Amy are phenomenal. Rab delivers a perfectly judged performance of Safe With You, one of the first songs Roddy and Tommy wrote, which captures the fragility and humorous perspective of a man in a church, standing vigil by his mother’s coffin, in conversation with God, trying to get assurance she will be OK. On Sunday night I am finally grabbing a glass of wine when I get a text. Dylan can return on Monday. Hallelujah. But the deputy stage manager is down. Gaaah. Emma is my second in command. Any director knows, really it’s your DSM who holds the whole thing and you together. Countries should be run by these meticulous, quietly genius humans. The set arrives. It’s unbelievably big. The designer Emily was inspired by Avril Paton’s epic painting Windows in the West, which captures Glasgow tenement life so brilliantly; where you can see across the street little snatches of all the different worlds being lived, like rows of tiny theatres. We do a stagger of the whole show by the end of the week. This is usually the part where you realise there are big chunks of the play that just don’t hang together, it’s three hours too long, that really poignant moment you thought was profoundly moving is actually just a bit dull and the whole rhythm of the piece feels like a jolty ride on a rollercoaster. However, for reasons belonging to the gods of theatre and a pretty phenomenal team, this feels actually kinda bangin’. We move to Greenock to go into tech. That’s where you get on a stage and try to piece the whole giant jigsaw together. Roddy and Tommy are still in the studio working on the album tracks. They are up until 3am most nights as they try to complete tracks for the show, but also make an entirely separate mixed album of all the songs to release for opening night. They juggle this with late-night calls to producers in the US whom they are working with. Always gotta have one eye on the next job. There is a frenzy of things that still need to happen. A painter is out in the car park painting a head to look like the deceased mother. She can’t get the lips to glue shut and it looks creepy. At the first dress rehearsal, Douglas darts around like an excited expectant father waiting for the birth of his child. He showers morale-boosting vibes wherever he goes. The creative team all talk through notes until midnight. There’s a slew of things to address. I stay up till 1.30am making lists of the priorities. I wake at six and already we are back and forth between sound, design and everyone else’s late-night emails as to what to address first. Then it’s the day of the first preview. We work through a heap of notes from the dress run. Three years’ work in total, a pandemic survived, an industry battered, a country in financial meltdown and a show must go on. Jesus … I hope folk like it. Orphans is on a Scottish tour until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,Diary of a director: ‘I am buzzing off the passion and sweat of this gang’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/01/diary-of-a-director-i-am-buzzing-off-the-passion-and-sweat-of-this-gang
4/2/2022,"Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has warned those who fled Ukraine’s capital at the start of the war with Russia not to return as “the risk of dying is pretty high”, even as he offered a glint of normality by partially lifting an alcohol ban. The former world heavyweight boxing champion said he expected “huge battles” in the coming days in satellite towns and the outskirts of the city, which Russian forces have repeatedly tried but failed to encircle. “The risk of dying is pretty high, and that’s why my advice to anyone who wants to come back is: please, take a little bit more time,” he said. Oleksiy Arestovych, a political adviser to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, echoed the mayor’s concerns. He said Russian attacks were continuing around Kyiv and the encircled city of Chernihiv, 100 miles to the north, despite claims from the Kremlin that they were withdrawing out of respect for the ongoing peace talks. “Our troops are chasing them both to the north-west and north-east [of Kyiv], pushing the enemy away from Kyiv,” Arestovych said. A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed Russian forces were planning to use a church north-west of Kyiv as a launchpad for a new assault. The official said: “We believe the Russian military is using this staging point as part of its assault on Kyiv.” At least 2 million people – half of the city’s population – fled Kyiv in the first few weeks of the conflict as Russian troops made their way to its north-eastern edge with the intention of storming the capital and likely decapitating the government. That plan failed, and the relaxation on Friday of the prohibition on the sale of alcohol in shops and the hospitality industry that has been imposed since 1 March had offered residents in Kyiv some glint of normality. Under the regulations, alcohol can now be bought between 11am and 4pm. The initial ban had initially been imposed due to fears of public disorder. On Friday, at the Flowers and Mafia corner bar in Kontraktova Square, in the heart of the old town of Kyiv, Andriy Andruschenko, 27, was nursing a small glass of cider, his first since before the war, while chatting with a couple of friends. Serving at the bar, Anna Golik, 23, said there had been a handful of others ordering a beer earlier in the day and that she hoped it would be the start of a “renaissance” for the city. Andruschenko, a freelance web designer, said, however, that he had no illusions that life was close to returning to normal. He had only recently returned from evacuating his girlfriend to Poland and a missile had struck close to his flat just two days earlier, forcing him to move in with a friend. “So many people are very tense,” he said. There are, however, signs of the city inching towards a more normal pattern of life. Ten minutes’ walk south through the city centre, past multiple checkpoints, sandbags and khaki-covered protective positions guarded by stern men grasping AK47 rifles, Iryna Asosok, 43, and Viktoria Shkurat, the owners of a small convenience store on Sofiivska street, near Independence Square, said a customer had come in that morning seeking a bottle of wine to give his daughter for her birthday. “We also had a few people asking for beer, the weaker stuff, but we only have whiskey, vodka and champagne,” Asosok said. Ukrainian railways said about 5,000 people had travelled to Kyiv between 25 March and 1 April. Arriving at Kyiv’s central railway station from the western Ukrainian city of Lviv, Mary Mykolaivna, 73, said she had fled with her family after on 27 February but that she wanted to be home. “I feel safe,” she said. “The walls of my Ukrainian house will protect me, but I left my daughter and her 16-year-old son there. My daughter Nataly wants to move abroad.” Dymtro Shevchuk, 20, a barman at a second Flowers and Mafia bar on Sofiivska street, fled with his friends the day the war started for his grandparents house’ in the village of Rushyn, 100 miles south-east of Kyiv. He said he had returned on Wednesday, bored and keen to earn some money. Shevchuk said he was one of three of the 15 to 20 members of staff who work for the bar chain in Kyiv to have returned despite the risks. “I was worried about coming back, but my desire to be here was bigger,” he said.",News/World news,"‘Risk of dying is high’, says Kyiv mayor to those who wish to return",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/risk-of-dying-is-high-says-kyiv-mayor-to-those-who-wish-to-return-ukraine
4/2/2022,"Jared Kushner testified on Thursday before the House select committee investigating the 6 January attack on the Capitol, becoming the first member of Donald Trump’s family to speak to investigators. Democrat Elaine Luria, a member of the select committee, confirmed that Kushner appeared before the panel “voluntarily”, although she would not provide details on what he said. “He was able to voluntarily provide information to us to verify, substantiate, provide his own take on this different reporting,” Luria told MSNBC. “So it was really valuable for us to have the opportunity to speak to him.” Kushner appeared virtually before investigators and spoke to committee counsel, two sources told the Guardian. A spokesperson for the January 6 committee declined to comment about Kushner’s testimony. Kushner is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and he served as a senior adviser to the former president. However, Kushner was not at the White House on 6 January as the Capitol attack unfolded because he was traveling back to Washington after a trip to Saudi Arabia. One source said before Kushner’s interview that investigators planned to ask him about a text sent by Ginni Thomas, the conservative activist who is married to the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, in the weeks after the election. The Washington Post and CBS News reported last week that Thomas sent a text to Mark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff, on 13 November that seemed to reference Kushner. “Just forwarded to yr gmail an email I sent Jared this am. Sidney Powell & improved coordination now will help the cavalry come and Fraud exposed and America saved,” Thomas wrote. Kushner may have also faced questions from the committee about Trump’s efforts to spread baseless claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election. According to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa’s book Peril, Kushner was involved in conversations about how to delicately tell Trump that he had lost the election to Joe Biden. The White House said Biden would not assert executive privilege over the testimony of Kushner, allowing him to speak to the committee about conversations he may have had with Trump in the days and weeks before the Capitol attack. “The president has spoken to the fact that January 6 was one of the darkest days in our country’s history and that we must have a full accounting of what happened to ensure that it never occurs again,” the White House communications director, Kate Bedingfield, said on Tuesday. “As a result, the White House has decided not to assert executive privilege over the testimony of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.” Asked whether Biden’s decision had been communicated to Kushner’s team, Bedingfield said: “I won’t speak to private communication between our attorneys and his.” Ivanka Trump has said she is in talks to voluntarily appear before the committee, after the Guardian reported that the committee was considering issuing a subpoena to compel her to testify. In a January letter to Trump, Thompson said the committee wanted to question her about what she witnessed in the Oval Office on 6 January. According to testimony from Keith Kellogg, the former national security adviser to Mike Pence, Trump witnessed a conversation during which her father pressured the vice-president to overturn the results of the election. Kellogg also testified that Trump made multiple attempts to convince her father to take action to quell the violence at the Capitol. Thompson requested Trump’s “voluntary cooperation” with the committee, writing: “We respect your privacy, and our questions will be limited to issues relating to January 6th, the activities that contributed to or influenced events on January 6th, and your role in the White House during that period.” Thompson initially proposed that Trump speak to the committee on 3 or 4 February, but those dates came and went without any progress. It remains unclear when Trump might testify or if she will provide any substantive information to the committee.

4/2/2022,"When Will Smith picked up his Oscar on Sunday, it felt as if he was at the pinnacle of his career, despite his on-stage assault of the comedian Chris Rock an hour earlier. Amid a standing ovation, Smith tearfully explained his actions as those of a man seeking to protect his family from abuse – Rock had referred to his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith’s baldness, even though she had recently made public a diagnosis of alopecia. Backstage, Rock declared himself “fine” and declined to pursue the matter. The Academy apparently asked Smith to leave the auditorium, but seemed satisfied by his refusal. Shortly after his speech, Smith was on the dancefloor at the Vanity Fair party, surrounded by well-wishers, statuette clutched to his bosom. All seemed – if not forgotten – then well on the way to being forgiven. Yet a week is a long time in showbusiness and six days on, Smith’s standing seems substantially more shaky. As soon as the slap aired on TV, celebrity viewers were swift to castigate the actor. Mark Hamill and Rob Reiner were disgusted; Jim Carrey and Judd Apatow were among those who suggested Smith should have been arrested. Politicians including Keir Starmer echoed the sense of outrage. Two days later, the verdicts of those in the room at the time of the incident began to filter through and were yet more stinging. Joseph Patel, a producer on the Oscar-winning documentary Summer of Soul, said Smith was “selfish” and had “robbed” he and his film-makers of their moment of glory. Pedro Almodóvar, sitting close to the stage, said the scene “produced a feeling of absolute rejection in me”. The Academy, under fire for inaction, swung into gear. A previously announced investigation was upgraded to disciplinary proceedings. Two of the evening’s three hosts declared themselves “traumatised”. “I’m still triggered,” said Amy Schumer, while Wanda Sykes declared that the scene “absolutely sickening … I physically felt ill.” On Friday, the Oscars telecast producer Will Packer sought to deflect criticism further by telling Good Morning America the Los Angeles police had immediately described the attack as “battery” and offered to arrest Smith. It was only the decision of the victim, said Packer, that meant this didn’t happen. “Chris was being very dismissive of those options,” he said. “He was like: ‘No, I’m fine.’ He was like, ‘No, no, no.’” Rock’s conciliatory mood was also credited by Packer as the reason Smith wasn’t ejected from the auditorium by the Academy’s leadership. “I said, Chris Rock doesn’t want that. I said, Rock has made it clear that he does not want to make a bad situation worse.” However, some sources suggest that Rock was not asked by Packer his opinion on Smith being ejected from the auditorium, only on the possibility of Smith being arrested by the police. Ticket prices for dates on Rock’s current comedy tour have soared but some punters at shows earlier in the week declared themselves disappointed by Rock’s failure to discuss the slap in his routine. Since making a public apology for “reacting emotionally” on Monday, Smith has also remained silent on the incident as his team recalibrates its response. A number of options seem possible. Smith could appear on a chatshow to discuss the incident, as Sykes and Packer have done – though this risks his appearing to diminish the seriousness of the incident. It is more likely that the actor will agree to a longer-form interview conducted by someone such as Oprah Winfrey. As his acceptance speech demonstrated, much of Smith’s defence rests on his claim of high emotional stakes and personal history. The narrative he has built is of a flawed man, well used to the unforgiving spotlight, who finally cracks under pressure when someone insults his family. This is bolstered by sections in his highly personal memoir, Will, published last autumn, which detailed the domestic violence he witnessed his father inflict on his mother, and his own feelings of guilt at not intervening. “What you have come to understand as ‘Will Smith’, the alien-annihilating MC, the bigger-than-life movie star, is largely a construction,” he wrote, “a carefully crafted and honed character designed to protect myself. To hide myself from the world. To hide the coward.” As well as being higher-profile and more lucrative, an hour-long TV special in the vein of Winfrey’s audience with Prince Harry and Meghan would allow space to further explain this background. Another route would be for Smith to self-produce such a show. His memoir was published in tandem with a YouTube series, The Best Shape of My Life, charting his 20lb weight loss in tandem with a programme of psychological growth. The actor and his family are no strangers to confessional broadcasting. Pinkett Smith’s popular Facebook show, Red Table Talk, hosted alongside her mother, “Gammy”, and daughter, Willow, has addressed issues including bereavement, sexual intimacy and digestive health. Will Smith guest starred on one episode in July 2020 concerning infidelity to discuss rumours around the couple’s own extramarital relationships and their brief separation, four years before. All the Smiths, including Jada and Will’s son Jaden, and Trey, Will’s son from a previous relationship, have appeared as themselves on TV shows only a step removed from the reality shows popularised by families such as the Kardashians. The regard with which Smith is held by the public could prove hard to shake. A YouGov poll of 1,319 US adults conducted earlier in the week found only a narrow majority thought he was wrong to have slapped Rock. It also remains in Hollywood’s best interests for Smith to regain the favour that has characterised his 30 years as a leading man. Films in which he played lead have accounted for almost $6.5bn (£5bn) in takings at the global box office, and his appeal has been of unusual breadth and reach, spanning genders, demographics, nationalities and ethnicities. One sector relatively vocal in its support for the actor over the past week has been the Christian press in the US, which was struck by the references in his speech to being “a vessel” guided by a “higher power”. Smith’s recounting of the advice offered to him by Denzel Washington to “be careful at your highest moment – that’s when the devil comes for you” was commended by Christian Broadcast News (CBN) as “scripturally sound”. Washington’s faith journey is one warmly followed by such outlets in the US; CBN has praised his “encouraging comments and focus on the devil’s attempts to take people down”. The results of the Academy’s investigation will be announced in about three weeks, but it appears unlikely that Smith will have his award withdrawn. Whoopi Goldberg, a member of the Academy’s board of governors, said on Monday: “We’re not going to take that Oscar from him,” and even Oscars won by expelled members have not been recalled. Only a handful of Academy members have been expelled, mostly as a result of convictions for sexual assault, including Harvey Weinstein, Roman Polanski and Bill Cosby (whose conviction for sexual assault was overturned last year). A further complicating factor is that Smith’s next movie, Emancipation, had been tipped to be a major player at the 2023 Academy Awards. Based on a real-life story, Smith stars as an escaped slave in 1863, photographs of whose lashed back much aided the abolitionists’ cause. The film was bought by Apple TV for $120m in 2020 at a virtual marketplace in Cannes, marking a record for a film festival acquisition. Apple scored its first best picture victory on Sunday, with Coda. The distributor will be counting on Smith being welcomed back to the fold in good time for promotional duties for that film, either through his own efforts or through public fatigue with slap-gate. On Thursday, the actor Daniel Radcliffe appeared to speak for many when asked his opinion of the incident on Good Morning Britain. “I saw it,” he told Susanna Reid. “I’m just so already dramatically bored of hearing people’s opinions about it, that I just don’t want to be another opinion added to it.”",Arts/Film,What next for Will Smith after Oscars slap?

4/2/2022,"A University of Oxford college has pledged to overhaul its handling of sexual assault cases after paying damages to settle a legal action taken by a woman who said she was raped by a fellow student. The woman, a student at Lady Margaret Hall, said she was raped after a man entered her room while she was asleep. Police investigated but he was not charged with any crime. The college settled the case this week, after the woman accused it of negligence and discrimination for the way she was treated after coming forward. The college agreed to pay damages as well as the woman’s legal costs. It did not admit liability. Georgina Calvert-Lee of McAllister-Olivarius, who acted for the woman, said: “Universities have known for years that their complaints-handling processes are defective, and the lawsuits keep coming. But while there are certainly some improvements, change is far too slow.” Calvert-Lee accused the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, of issuing guidelines on sexual misconduct without imposing any mandatory requirements to enforce them. “The college system in Oxford lends itself to further confusion, as students are pointed from college to the university and back again just trying to find out how to make a formal complaint,” Calvert-Lee said. Lady Margaret Hall (LMH) said it could not comment on individual student cases – after the allegations were reported by the Times – but a spokesperson said it “recognised that there is scope for improvement in our non-academic disciplinary procedures, which includes how the college deals with allegations of sexual assault”. The alleged assault occurred while Alan Rusbridger, the former Guardian editor, was LMH’s principal between 2015 and 2021. Rusbridger said: “Numerous staff and tutors went to great efforts to support and protect a student who alleged she had been attacked by her partner. Both the police and the college mounted thorough investigations into the alleged attack but were unable to determine what had happened to the required burdens of proof.” The woman said the college told her not to speak about the attack or the college’s policies on social media. It included a clause in a “non-contact” agreement that asked both students to refrain from public comment and threatened expulsion if they “published material” in the media. Calvert-Lee said students and junior academics “up and down the country” had complained of similar treatment, including being threatened with disciplinary action if they talked about their experiences to others. Rusbridger said that there was no “blanket gagging order” or non-disclosure agreement imposed by the college. He said that while the police investigation was still active, the woman had posted, under her own name and to a Facebook group of 2,500 people, the claim that she had been raped by a man who was identifiable. “The student was advised of the obvious risks involved in this posting: she apologised and volunteered to delete all her social media accounts,” Rusbridger said. “After this LMH asked both parties to refrain from public comment while the case was active as part of a no-contact agreement. Both parties signed without comment or protest.” A spokesperson for LMH said the college had been working with the Oxford student union’s It Happens Here campaign against sexual violence, and agreed to ban the use of non-disclosure agreements in sexual misconduct cases. Oxford University said it did not use non-disclosure agreements to prevent students from reporting sexual misconduct or other illegal or inappropriate behaviour, other than settlements in exceptional circumstances. A spokesperson said the launch of the university’s sexual harassment and violence support service had led to “increasing numbers of students coming forward and we would encourage anyone affected by this very serious issue to seek support”.",News/Society,Oxford college pays damages to woman after alleged rape by fellow student,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/01/oxford-college-pays-damages-to-woman-after-alleged-by-fellow-student
4/2/2022,"A prestigious Chicago high school that counts Michelle Obama among its alumni launched an investigation after a white teacher hung a Black doll by its neck in his classroom and was challenged by a Black colleague. In an email to students and families obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times, Joyce Kenner, principal of the Whitney Young magnet high school, wrote of the Monday incident: “Unfortunately … a teacher hung a small stuffed African American football doll by a pull-down string from a projector screen in their classroom. “The teacher indicated he found the doll in his room and wanted the students to see if someone would claim it. A colleague approached the teacher about the doll and the conversation between the teachers became contentious.” Footage of the confrontation was shared on social media. More than 1,000 people signed an online petition calling for the removal of the white teacher. A parent of a Whitney Young student, Michelle Donegan, told WLS, an ABC affiliate: “I believe he should be removed from the school. His teaching degree should be taken away. He knows what lynching is. He knows what hanging the doll would represent, but did he give any thought to how it would affect the students.” A student who did not want to be named said: “It really surprised me and I was really disgusted because our school is supposed to be very inclusive and diverse.” In her email, Kenner said: “It has been my goal to create a community of respect and professionalism over the past 27 years as principal. We strive each day to make sure that every student, faculty and staff member feels comfortable, supported and safe.” She also said she would “follow the disciplinary protocol established by Chicago public schools”. In a statement, Chicago public schools said: “Our schools and the district investigate and address all complaints and allegations of wrongdoing in accordance with district policies and procedures.” The Chicago Teachers Union said: “We understand the investigation at Whitney Young is ongoing, but practices that mitigate the harm of racial biases must be also be ongoing, and consistent, in our schools. “Mayor [Lori] Lightfoot has a responsibility to provide a safe space for every member of our school communities, which is especially important in a district that serves a student population that is 90% Black and Brown children. “… Practices that mitigate the harm of racial biases must [be] consistent in our schools. And any definition of ‘safety’ must include creating and reinforcing an environment of equity and inclusion for all students, staff and faculty of colour.” On Wednesday, the school said an unnamed teacher had been suspended. It also held a listening session for students.",News/US news,Chicago high school investigates after teacher hung Black doll in classroom,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/chicago-high-school-teacher-black-doll-classroom

4/2/2022,"Boris Johnson performed two U-turns within the space of a few hours on Thursday relating to the government’s four-year-old pledge to ban LGBTQ+ conversion practices. On Thursday, ITV obtained a leak of a Downing Street briefing paper titled Conversion Therapy Handling Plan, which said “the [prime minister] has agreed we should not move forward with legislation”. The paper recommended blaming the change on “pressures on the cost of living and the crisis in Ukraine”. A government spokesperson confirmed it was looking instead at ways of preventing it through existing law and “other non-legislative measures”. But after a furious backlash by campaigners for a ban, Johnson swiftly performed a second U-turn. The government said legislation would be introduced in the Queen’s speech in May – but it would cover only sexual orientation and exclude gender dysphoria. A report by leading human rights lawyers and experts published in October defined conversion practices as attempts “to suppress, ‘cure’ or change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity”. Such practices were “motivated by a misguided belief that being gay or transgender is wrong, are degrading and psychologically damaging, and constitute a serious violation of the basic human rights of LGBT+ people under international law”, wrote Helena Kennedy QC in the Guardian. It is sometimes called conversion “therapy”, “reparative therapy” or “gay cure therapy”. Conversion practices include counselling and psychotherapy, prayer aimed at changing someone’s sexual orientation or gender identity, and exorcism – including beatings and psychological trauma. It is difficult to know how widespread these practices are, as many forms are carried out behind closed doors and victims are often too traumatised to speak about their experiences. But a national LGBTQ+ survey carried out by the government in 2018 found that about 5% of 108,000 people who responded said they had been offered some form of “conversion therapy”, while 2% had undergone it. People from an ethnic minority background were twice as likely to be affected. About 10% of Christian respondents and 20% of Muslims said they had undergone or been offered conversion therapy, compared with 6% with no religion. More than half said it was conducted by a faith group, while one in five received the treatment from healthcare professionals. Almost one in 10 trans men said they had been offered conversion therapy, and one in 25 said they had undergone it. The NHS and other professional bodies have warned that all forms of conversion practices are “unethical and potentially harmful”. Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, has said conversion practices are “unacceptable and harmful” and the college supports a ban. In the last Queen’s speech in May 2021, Johnson’s government described conversion practices as “coercive and abhorrent”. Polling released last May by YouGov showed that almost two-thirds (64%) of British adults believe conversion practices should be banned. Support was across the political spectrum and all age groups, according to the survey of 1,803 adults. In 2017, the Church of England condemned conversion practices and called on the government to ban them, saying they had “no place in the modern world”. Jayne Ozanne, a leading campaigner against the practice who quit as an LGBTQ+ adviser to the government over its foot-dragging on a ban, had two breakdowns and two spells in hospital after undergoing “spiritual abuse” in an attempt to “deliver” her from her sexual orientation. “It made me feel ashamed of my sexuality, guilty, sinful, desperate – but most of all deeply depressed, which led to a breakdown. I was unable to function,” she said in 2017. Some religious organisations have opposed moves to outlaw conversion practices, saying the government should not set parameters on the content of prayer and that a ban would limit freedom of religion. Evangelical churches welcomed the government’s initial U-turn on Thursday, saying it was “a great relief to many Christians”. Graham Nicholls, director of the Affinity partnership of churches, said: “We will continue to have freedom as Christians to instruct our children, and for churches to continue the loving, compassionate exercise of orthodox Christian ministry, including the teaching of the biblical understanding of sex and marriage.” Aside from religion, some believed legislation would have an adverse impact on talking therapy for young people trying to navigate complex identity issues. Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at No 10, told the BBC on Friday that a ban would have had “profound consequences for children struggling with gender dysphoria. It would create a situation where doctors, therapists, even parents would be deterred from exploring with a child any feelings of what else may be going on for fear of being told they’re trying to change a child’s identity. And that is deeply concerning.” But the Peter Tatchell Foundation accused the prime minister of “throwing trans people under the bus”. It said: “We feel conned and tricked. The prime minister has taken a decision to appease transphobes who oppose protection for trans people and who support attempts to turn them cisgender … It looks like a bid to stoke trans culture wars for political gain in the run-up to the next election.” Legislation will be introduced in the Queen’s speech next month that will ban conversion practices relating to sexual orientation – but it will not cover transgender people.",News/World news,What are LGBTQ+ conversion practices and why is there a push to ban them?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/what-are-lgbtq-conversion-practices-and-why-is-there-a-push-to-ban-them
4/2/2022,"On Late Night, Seth Meyers discussed the recent allegations from 26-year-old Republican Madison Cawthorn, who claimed he has been invited to orgies by fellow Washington politicians, and witnessed cocaine use – something the host called “one of the weirdest political scandals in recent memory”. During a podcast interview, the rightwing congressman expressed shock that politicians he had once looked up to had invited him to a “sexual get-together”. Meyers called Cawthorn the “first dude with a backwards baseball cap that calls it a sexual get-together”. He joked that it sounded less like some debauched orgy and more like “the plot of The Ice Storm”. Republicans have been angered by this “bizarre and shocking allegation” – even those “accustomed to a certain level of awfulness from fellow Republicans”. It has led to outrage from his peers and reportedly their spouses. This week has also seen Donald Trump accused of using burner phones during the January 6 riot to maintain privacy. He has claimed to not know what a burner phone is. “Dude, you worked in New York real estate for decades. I bet every phone he used was a burner phone,” Meyers said. Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton has claimed that the ex-president is lying, as he has used them before and spoken of them. Meyers said Trump has always gone overboard with his defence. “It’s like if your parents say they found weed in your sock drawer and you say, ‘What the hell is a sock?’” he joked. Meyers said the party is consumed by its own conspiracy theories, and focusing more on Cawthorn’s lurid stories than the fact that they are missing seven hours of Trump’s call logs during an insurrection. On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert noted that it’s been five weeks since the start of Russia’s failed invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s advisers have apparently been deliberately misinforming him of the situation, claiming more of a victory. “Putin is clearly a victim of his own pro-Russian propaganda,” he said. “He doesn’t even know that Russia lost Rocky IV. Over there it’s an eight-minute film called Ivan Drago Strong Good.” Russia has also banned Instagram and Colbert joked that this has led to no brunch grams, which “violates international law and the international house of pancakes”. It has also led to Russian influencers struggling to make money. “Influencers have no other marketable skills,” Colbert said. “What are they gonna do? Go door-to-door to make people feel bad about not having a thigh gap?” This week has also seen an investigation launched into Will Smith’s on-stage slap on Chris Rock. The Academy has said it is important to protect the integrity of the institution. “And it is so important to protect the integrity of the Academy,” Colbert said before coughing out the names of Roman Polanski, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. He said that the Academy is “ready to dole out the pain”, which might involve Smith being forced to watch “a double-bill of Hitch and The Legend of Bagger Vance”. He then took time to criticise the hiring of ex-Trump official Mick Mulvaney by CBS News, given that they will now be colleagues. He referred to Mulvaney as “Nostra-dumbass” for his awful predictions and a “craven toadie to a tyrant”.",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on orgygate: ‘One of the weirdest political scandals in recent memory’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/01/seth-meyers-orgygate-congress-late-night-tv
