5/17/2022,"One needs but scroll through Facebook or watch Fox News for a few minutes to hear an accusation of indoctrination in public schools. Some would have people believe that indoctrination is utterly rampant in K-12, though The Common Core Standards, adopted by many public schools, including in Kentucky, the first state to adopt them, explicitly and intentionally guide students in critical thinking. Indoctrination and critical thinking can’t coexist, since indoctrination is, by definition, “the act or process of forcing somebody to accept a particular belief or set of beliefs and not allowing them to consider any others.” There is no room for criticism, for objection, for individuality of thought with indoctrination. If work coming out of The Louisville Christian Academy is any indication, it is private schools we might need to watch more carefully for indoctrination. In a recent tweet by JP Davis, a Kentucky business owner, a leaked assignment shows one of the clearest examples of indoctrination and heartbreaking homophobia I’ve ever seen in any curriculum. Modern day education assignment at Christian Academy of Louisville. Middle school. Write a letter to your homosexual friend explaining why it’s wrong. Shameful. #stopthehate pic.twitter.com/UdgXv3FEBA — JP Davis (@kyjpdavis) May 13, 2022 In the assignment, a student must imagine a friend of a similar age and gender that they’ve known “since kindergarten” who attends their church and is “struggling with homosexuality” (sic). Given eight short sentences, they are asked to use logic and scripture to show the friend that “homosexuality will not bring them satisfaction” while making sure to signal they “don’t approve of their lifestyle” all while making sure to communicate that they “love” them. In short, the students are set up to fail, since the task is impossible. More: Homework at Christian Academy of Louisville: Persuade your friend to stop being gay First, being gay is not a choice. This is settled truth. No one asking a gay person to change can be acting in love towards them while doing it, because they erase basic truths about their personhood. Anyone asking a gay person to change is saying to them that who they are, at an intrinsic, immutable level, should not be - we can’t be acting in love while we are actively telling someone that a fixed part of them shouldn’t exist. Secondly, it is utterly impossible, and I speak as an English teacher, to appeal to logic when telling someone that being gay won’t bring them satisfaction, since, despite heavy discrimination, gay people tend to be happier in marriage than their straight counterparts. More importantly, gay people are equally satisfied in life only when they are accepted, so not accepting a person because of a characteristic and then blaming the characteristic for their unhappiness over not being accepted is not only a textbook example of a fallacy of cause and effect, it’s cruel. This assignment, given by a school purporting to prepare students “to reason logically” sets students up not to understand rational thinking and equally conflates love and cruelty. Moreover, the assignment utterly lacks critical thinking because it is indoctrination. Despite the fact that many mainstream churches (and the majority of Christians) believe homosexuality should be accepted, this assignment is predicated upon one narrow understanding and requires all students to comply with it to get points. In fact, according to the rubric, a student can receive a “fair” grade if they employ “little love” and “no scripture”. The lowest descriptor on the rubric, interestingly, requires at least “one truth” - but it requires “little love” and neither logic nor scripture. In a school system based upon Christ, neither love nor scripture are required for minimum points. The assignment does, however, mandate truth – but as the school defines it. From where, then, does that truth come? David Gooblar explains that indoctrination is “an effort to change … beliefs and instill a fear or reluctance to consider conflicting evidence.” It is in this fear that the rejection of LGBTQ people (and any other people) resides. Students will not come to reject LGBTQ people based upon love. It’s impossible because love is the opposite of hate. This is why the rubric still gives points even if little love is shown. Students will not come to reject LGBTQ people based purely upon scripture; denominations are divided, but plenty of scripture-bound churches affirm gay people. This is why the rubric still gives points even if no scripture is shown. Students will not come to reject LGBTQ people based upon logic. It’s impossible because homophobia is recklessly illogical. This is why the rubric still gives points even if no logic is shown. Students will only come to reject LGBTQ people as people always have: through indoctrination. This is why the rubric requires at least “one truth” for even the lowest-performing students to get a minimum score–the “truth” that being gay is wrong. Get alerted on the latest school news:: Download The Courier Journal app today This is the “one truth” on which the assignment rests, the “one truth” that must be confessed for a student to get any points, the “one truth” for which the entire assignment was made. This is the thing about indoctrination - it necessarily requires coercion, because, were it to use any other approach, like truth, logic, or love, the lesson simply falls apart.

5/17/2022,"Fifteen minutes before Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) was due to go on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show on March 30, 2021—hours after a bombshell report that he was under investigation for allegedly sex trafficking a minor—Gaetz was shouting, repeatedly, at FBI agents in his family home. “Do you have a warrant to be here?” Gaetz yelled, according to an FBI report of the event obtained by The Daily Beast. But as adversarial as Gaetz was in those moments, the agents weren’t after him. They were actually there to help him, and his father, who had been cooperating with the FBI for several days in a sting operation that Gaetz claimed on live TV minutes later would clear his name. Bombshell Letter: Gaetz Paid for Sex With Minor, Wingman Says This scene and others are detailed in previously unreported documents that shine new light on the sting operation, which Gaetz helped orchestrate in the frenzied days before The New York Times published the explosive report that changed the Panhandle congressman’s public and political life. The documents, in possession of federal prosecutors and obtained exclusively by The Daily Beast, confirm parts of the story of international intrigue and attempted fraud that Gaetz described to Carlson minutes after the agents left his home. But the records also contradict fundamental claims in Gaetz’s version of events, raising new questions about the congressman’s own role in the sting, as well as when and why he began to cooperate with the feds. One document contains a key but so far elusive detail about the origins of the ongoing federal sex trafficking investigation into Gaetz: when, exactly, it began. When Gaetz first recounted the story to Carlson, it was, for an unprepared public still processing the news of the sex trafficking probe, a head-spinning chain of events. According to Gaetz, two men approached his father—Don Gaetz, the wealthy former president of the Florida Senate and a political power broker to this day—with a bizarre quid pro quo: If Don Gaetz would give them $25 million, they could make the investigation into his son’s alleged sex crimes go away. The stated motivation for the $25 million payment was perhaps even more bizarre. The men said they wanted to use the money to rescue Bob Levinson, an American taken hostage in Iran and long presumed dead. “Our family was so troubled by that, we went to the local FBI,” Gaetz told Carlson. But FBI records dispute that sequence of events. According to the documents, the FBI learned of the Levinson plot independently through layers of intermediaries. Agents only spoke to Matt Gaetz after reaching out to him through one of those intermediaries. Matt Gaetz Somehow Feels ‘Vindicated’ Despite Being Under Investigation Gaetz also mangled the story in other ways, telling Carlson without evidence that this was all a “deep state” plot against him. He claimed the allegations in the Times report somehow sprang from this same plot. But that logic didn’t hold. The Gaetz probe was already several months old, according to the documents. The FBI investigation into the Levinson plot had just started days ago. When the Fox News segment was over, a baffled Carlson called it “one of the weirdest interviews I’ve ever conducted.” Eventually, however, Gaetz achieved some degree of vindication when one of the men at the center of the hostage plan, convicted felon Stephen M. Alford, admitted last November to wire fraud in connection with that plot. Still, the records contradict Gaetz more than they confirm his sequence of events. According to the documents, Gaetz had his first conversation with the FBI on March 19, when he told agents that his father had already met the two men—Alford and another associate—just the day before to discuss their offer in person. It wasn’t, as Gaetz had claimed, that his family contacted the FBI to discuss a potential extortion scheme. According to that FBI special agent’s field report contained in the documents, the agent learned of the plot earlier that day when a retired agent from Jacksonville tipped her off to a lead. The active agent followed that lead to another former FBI agent—this one based in Miami—who told her about the Levinson plan. The men making the offer, this Miami agent said, had claimed to have “information on Congressman Gaetz.” (The report also clarifies that the Miami agent’s tip didn’t come directly from Gaetz.) When the FBI finally got in touch with Matt Gaetz over the phone, he claimed that on the previous day, his father had two in-person meetings with the men to discuss their plan. Alford was brought in for the second meeting, Matt Gaetz noted, and promised to “make Congressman GAETZ’s criminal case go away.” At the end of the phone call, Gaetz asked the FBI agent to call his father. Contact between the Gaetzes and Alford ceased without a deal. And on March 25, one week after meeting with Alford, Don Gaetz was in the FBI’s Fort Walton Beach office, with his attorney and two special agents. A record of the meeting shows the agents spun through a PowerPoint-assisted strategy session, designed to restart the Levinson negotiations—and sting the alleged perpetrators. Convicted Fraudster Charged With Trying to Bilk Rep. Matt Gaetz and Dad for $25 Million In that meeting, Don Gaetz mentioned the investigation into his son. He told the pair of agents that he had heard, third-hand, that a former Justice Department attorney tied to the Levinson plan had brought up the investigation in a conversation. When agents inquired further, Don Gaetz’s attorney intervened and referred them to Matt Gaetz’s lawyer. Matt Gaetz—whose campaign paid $5,000 to Trump whisperer and notorious “deep state” antagonist Roger Stone for strategic consulting the day before his father’s meeting with the FBI—would days later invoke that former DOJ attorney as a “deep state” bogeyman in his Carlson appearance. The next day, on March 26, Don Gaetz surreptitiously taped an in-person conversation with Alford’s lawyer, the former DOJ attorney mentioned above. He later recorded another conversation with Alford himself, where Alford promised a presidential pardon for his son. Then, according to the records, at around 2:30 p.m. on March 30, Don Gaetz met a special agent at a Publix grocery store in Niceville, Florida, to receive a recording device for a follow-up conversation with Alford the next day. Hours later, The New York Times disclosed the sex trafficking investigation into Gaetz. That evening—around 7:45 p.m., according to the FBI report—two special agents rang the doorbell at the Gaetz family residence. They had come for their recording device. The sting was off, but the records don’t explain why, and they don’t mention the Times story. After Don Gaetz handed them the recording device, the agents asked if they could take photos of his text messages with Alford, according to FBI records of the incident. Don Gaetz “voluntarily” handed over his phone, and as an agent snapped one photo of a text, Matt Gaetz “appeared outside from another area of the residence.” “M. GAETZ yelled, ‘He has a lawyer!’ multiple times,” the report says. The agent handed the phone back to Don Gaetz, and they arranged to get in touch with his attorney. Gaetz Paid Accused Sex Trafficker, Who Then Venmo’d Teen As the agents walked back to their vehicle, according to the document, “M. GAETZ yelled, ‘Do you have a warrant to be here?’” and asked his father if they took anything from him. The agents did not respond, the report says. Don Gaetz answered his son: no, they only took the recording device they had previously given him. Minutes later, Matt Gaetz was on national television delivering a broadside against the men he still alleges extorted his family, while at the same time describing a series of events that FBI records show wasn’t accurate. A Gaetz spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Gaetz stands by his version of events. “Rep. Matt Gaetz stands by every word he has said about this fiasco. Time has only vindicated his claims and resulted in the guilty plea of one of the people involved in a shakedown of his family,” the spokesperson said. “Due to ongoing investigations of other people involved in this shakedown, we will not have further comment.” It is unclear why Gaetz, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee and has oversight of the Justice Department, would seek to disclose an allegedly ongoing and previously unreported investigation. Three people familiar with the events denied there was an investigation, and the FBI declined to comment. The Daily Beast could only confirm that one of the people involved is currently under investigation: Matt Gaetz. Although the ongoing investigation has persisted with little action recently, the government records provide new insight as to when that investigation started. According to previous news reports, the DOJ, led by Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr, launched its investigation in the “final months of the Trump administration.” But the FBI documents more narrowly ascribe the start of the investigation to the “summer of 2020.” Rep. Matt Gaetz Snorted Cocaine With Escort Who Had ‘No Show’ Gov’t Job DOJ records obtained by The Daily Beast show that the probe opened specifically in August 2020—the same month the feds indicted Gaetz’s former “wingman” Joel Greenberg for allegedly sex trafficking the teen at the center of the Gaetz investigation. Ultimately, only one man—Alford—pleaded guilty to the pardon-for-hostage plan, admitting last November to one count of wire fraud. The charge carries up to 20 years, and Alford currently awaits sentencing in Santa Rosa County jail. In late April, the court pushed his sentencing date back to June 1, for reasons still under seal. On Monday, a federal judge in the Middle District of Florida also postponed Greenberg’s sentencing for a third time. Greenberg, who pleaded guilty to the trafficking charge one year ago, is now scheduled to be sentenced in August. The delay, the judge said, was “in the interest of justice.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.
