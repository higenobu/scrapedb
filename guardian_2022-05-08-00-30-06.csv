5/8/2022,"If you want to know who the world’s richest man has on speed dial, then a regulatory filing on Thursday provided an insight. Elon Musk announced a score of new backers for his $44bn (£35.6bn) Twitter takeover, including Oracle tycoon Larry Ellison, the crypto market’s leading trading platform, the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and a Saudi prince. If this was Tesla’s boss displaying his power network, it was also an admission that – despite recent words to the contrary – the numbers behind his audacious bid do matter. Discussing his offer last month, Musk said: “I don’t care about the economics at all.” For some of Wall Street’s biggest banks, Tesla’s shareholders and even Twitter users, the economics are very important indeed. The initial funding package behind the takeover, which requires shareholder approval,was initially split into three elements: $21bn in equity, or Elon Musk’s own cash; $12.5bn of loans secured against Musk’s shares in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs; and a further $13bn in loans from a group of seven banks, secured against Twitter itself. That changed on Thursday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the equity commitment had risen to $27.25bn, helped by a group of 18 investors including Ellison ($1bn), the Binance trading platform ($500m) and Qatar Holding ($375m), an investment arm of the Gulf state’s wealth fund. They are putting in $7.1bn, plus a contribution from the Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who also plans to roll his $1.9bn Twitter stake into the deal rather than cashing out. As part of this reshuffle, the loans secured against Musk’s 15.7% stake in Tesla have been halved to $6.25bn. The bank loan commitment stays the same. Musk’s comment about the economics of the bid, in an interview at a TED conference in mid-April, came before he confirmed hastily put-together funding for a takeover. It was a move that swayed shareholders in Twitter and the company’s board, who accepted the bid days later. But the off-the-cuff nature of his comments belie the serious nature of the financial commitments the Tesla tycoon is making. Some experts point to a high-risk structure, regardless of last week’s changes – and what it means for the company he is buying. “Musk hasn’t provided a lot of detail about his business plan for the company,” says Jill Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania. “Although he has taken steps to reduce his risk by bringing in additional investors, he still has a lot of personal exposure financially, he is paying a high price based on Twitter’s existing business model and he has large loans from the banks. Given the size of Musk’s personal financial exposure, he will be under pressure to run Twitter to make money, both to manage his own financial risk and to repay the bank financing.” First, let’s look at Musk’s commitment. Last month he revealed he had sold $8.5bn worth of shares in Tesla since announcing the takeover, presumably to help fund the deal. His stake in Tesla, which forms the core of his wealth, is integral to financing the deal. If you strip out new investors and Prince Talwaleed’s stake, plus Musk’s own $3.9bn stake in Twitter, he still needs to provide around $14.3bn of equity for the deal. A simple reading of this would be: he owns $155bn in Tesla shares, so contributing just over $14bn should be easy. But it is not quite as straightforward as that. According to a filing with the SEC, Musk has already pledged 92.3m of his 163m Tesla shares as “collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness”. Then there is the $6.25bn already pledged for the deal – in an arrangement known as a margin loan, where the borrower could be required to make good any shortfall in the value of the shares that the debt is secured against. Presuming the loan-to-value ratio of 20% in the original margin loan agreement is carried over, this means a further 35.8m shares are tied up. So, looking at Musk’s total shareholding, this leaves him with about 35m unpledged shares worth $30bn. In theory, these could be pledged or sold to raise the remaining $14bn of cash needed for the deal. But Musk tweeted on 29 April that he had “No further TSLA sales planned after today”. Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University, says he would be surprised if Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street bank that has played the lead role in the debt financing, had not carried out some form of due diligence on Musk’s commitment. “There is no way Morgan Stanley would have proceeded as they did unless they had looked in Elon’s eyes and seen some evidence that he could come up with that money.” The Tesla chief executive has other sources of wealth, including Tesla shares already sold, his SpaceX rocket business and his Boring Company tunnelling firm. He is also in line to receive $20bn worth of Tesla share options (based on Friday’s share price), although he cannot cash these in for five years. According to calculations by CreditSights, a credit research firm, the bank financing alone will leave Twitter highly leveraged once the deal is completed. Twitter’s gross indebtedness will be nine times its underlying Ebitda – a measure of profit – for 2021, says CreditSights. “That is very high and certainly not a comfortable amount of leverage,” says Jordan Chalfin, a senior technology analyst at CreditSights. It is against the backdrop of these numbers that Musk has floated ideas such as charging a “slight” fee for commercial and government users, although it will stay free for casual users.The New York Times also reported on Friday that Musk expects to pay down the $800m-$900m debt interest costs with free cash flow that he expects to grow to $9.4bn by 2028, although in the short term it looks like it will be tight. According to Chaflin, a proxy for Twitter’s ability to cover its debt interest would be subtracting Twitter’s capital expenditure costs – $1bn last year – from the company’s Ebitda. Stock market analysts’ forecasts for Twitter Ebitda, according to a Reuters poll, is $1.4bn in 2022 and $1.8bn in 2023. It could be a squeeze. “The extremely high levels of debt Elon plans to saddle Twitter with come at a high price – investment for growth,” says Cornell’s Pascarella. “A technology company like Twitter needs to invest in itself to continue to innovate and grow. Post deal, most of Twitter’s cash flow will be used not for investment, but to service debt.”Speaking about Twitter at a recent conference, Musk said: “I mean, I could technically afford it.” He can, but some users might have to pay.",News/Technology,Elon Musk’s takeover financing deal could clip Twitter’s wings,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/07/elon-musks-takeover-financing-deal-could-clip-twitters-wings
5/8/2022,"When Mark Tucker arrived as HSBC’s new chairman on a cloudy London day in October 2017, he was prepared for a challenge. The former insurance boss was the first outsider to lead the now 157-year-old bank, which was in the middle of a period of intense upheaval. HSBC was slimming down its investment bank, selling poorly performing businesses and slashing thousands of jobs as it tried to adapt to the post-financial-crisis era. While Tucker was well equipped to guide the lender through that period of turmoil, he must now wrestle with a far bigger existential question – should the bank be broken up? He has form on handling such decisions: as head of insurer Prudential in the late 2000s, he withstood calls for splitting the weaker UK business away from its more lucrative Asian operations, which made up more than half of profits from new business. Yet his resistance there ultimately proved futile. Prudential eventually did split – albeit nearly a decade after Tucker’s departure. A similar dilemma now faces him at HSBC, after its largest investor, the Chinese insurance group Ping An, revived calls to separate the bank’s profitable Asian business from the rest of the lender’s operations. HSBC’s Scottish founder, Sir Thomas Sutherland, envisioned a Hong Kong-based lender that would finance trade between Europe and Asia when he launched the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865. But the bank’s successes have largely mirrored the rise of globalisation, having splashed cash on a string of acquisitions since the 1970s – including Britain’s Midland Bank in 1992 – as international business boomed. By the 2008 financial crisis – by which time HSBC had a presence in 86 countries and had long since shifted its headquarters to London – the bank’s traditional home markets still accounted for most of its profits. “It was strange situation in which the bank was making most of its money in territories it had originally been in before the global push abroad,” said David Kynaston, the historian and author of The Lion Wakes: A Modern History of HSBC. Subsequent shareholder pressure to capitalise on its strengths meant backtracking on some of those projects. Before publicly pushing for a breakup, Ping An had privately called for HSBC to get out of money-draining assets in the west, refocus on Asia, and embark on a cost-cutting scheme to trim excesses. “Over the last 15 years or so, there’s been quite a significant rowing back,” Kynaston said, noting HSBC’s recent decision to ditch its retail banks in the US and France, and the shrinking of its footprint from 86 to 64 countries since the financial crisis. The financial arguments for pruning its global network have since been amplified into debate over a breakup. Ping An has expressed disappointment at the return on its investment, having seen the dividend cancelled during the first UK lockdown, and reinstated at only half the level seen before the pandemic. Some have suggested that any shareholder vote on a split of HSBC’s Asian and western operations would also be a referendum on the bank’s strategy under Tucker, a former trainee professional footballer and diehard Chelsea FC fan. Tucker clashed with, and had a hand in ousting, chief executive John Flint, who had been in post less than two years, in August 2019, before triggering a more ambitious cost-cutting agenda – involving about 35,000 job losses – under Flint’s replacement, Noel Quinn. Ping An’s calls for a split have added fuel to an already burning fire. HSBC’s role straddling east and west has been eroded by an increasingly polarised political climate and a wave of protectionism that was turbocharged by Donald Trump’s trade war with China and has gained further traction during the pandemic. Most notably, HSBC has struggled to navigate pressures from Washington and London on one side, and Beijing on the other, after the bank controversially accepted China’s authoritarian crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong in 2020. Meanwhile, the fact that UK and US regulators have a hold over HSBC even though it makes most of its profits in Asia has ruffled feathers across its investor base. HSBC’s leadership has consistently defended itself against political pressure to take a side in the crackdown in Hong Kong, and internally there is support for the bank’s position, with some believing its single biggest advantage is in providing a platform for navigating such geopolitics, and ultimately allowing money to flow across borders regardless of regimes. Rowing back on its international ambitions would also have severe consequences beyond the bank’s balance sheet. About 9% of funds linked to global trade run through its infrastructure, and a breakup would add further friction at a time when the world is still recovering from the pandemic, feeling the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine, and wrestling with rising inflation that has put pressure on supply chains. “HSBC supports customers, corporates and institutions across key capital and trade hubs around the world,” the bank said in a statement. “This network manifests itself in our leading global franchises across retail, wealth and wholesale banking. The most important thing for management to focus on is continuing to drive higher returns, as we have done very successfully, despite the disruptions of Covid-19.” Geopolitics and trade aside, British politicians also have a financial interest in keeping HSBC together. The Treasury will be acutely aware of the potential losses associated with a breakup: while hiving off HSBC’s Asia operations would probably leave the UK retail bank intact, the exchequer’s earnings through the UK bank levy would plunge. The banking sector surcharge, first imposed by former chancellor George Osborne in the wake of the financial crisis, taxes UK-headquartered banks on their global balance sheets rather than their local operations, ensuring that global lenders such as Standard Chartered and HSBC contribute more heavily to the British public purse. In 2019, HSBC paid an extra $988m (£800m) to the Treasury as a result of the bank levy, more than six times the $154m it paid that year in UK corporation tax. The current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may have been taken that income for granted when he announced plans to slash the bank levy from 8% to 3% from 2023. The Treasury declined to comment, saying any decision was a commercial matter for HSBC. However, it is the UK’s grip on HSBC’s finances that seems to have fuelled Ping An’s calls for a split. Ping An – which is China’s most valuable publicly listed insurer – first declared a 5% stake in the lender in December 2017, at a time when HSBC’s shares were trading at 706p on average, and the bank was paying 51 cents a share in dividends. The investment was strategic for Ping An, which took on the shareholding through a life insurance arm that relies on dividend income to offset long-term liabilities. But by 2020, the world had changed. With regulators fearing the worst in the early days of the pandemic, UK banks reached an agreement with the Bank of England to scrap nearly £8bn in dividends, ensuring that lenders had a strong enough capital cushion for whatever economic blows might ensue. The announcement, which meant HSBC would have to backtrack on promises to pay $4.2bn to shareholders, disturbed investors and reignited debates about HSBC’s structure: a less lucrative European jurisdiction had been able to dictate major financial decisions to a bank that drew about two-thirds of its profits from a different continent entirely. But Ping An hung on. In September 2020, it gave HSBC a vote of confidence when it raised its stake to 8% and become its largest shareholder – right in the middle of the political row over the bank’s support for China’s controversial security law being extended to Hong Kong. The resulting calm was shortlived. Ping An faced further frustration when HSBC reinstated its dividend at just half the previous rate after the Bank of England lifted restrictions last year. HSBC executives met their largest shareholder regularly in the months that followed, though discussions turned tense at the turn of the new year. It is understood that they felt blindsided by Ping An’s call for a breakup, having never been given official notice that the investor was calling for an outright split. It has been suggested that Ping An’s decision to air its grievances via the press is a result of pressures over its own faltering fortunes. On the same day its breakup demands went public, it reported a 24% drop in first-quarter profits to 20.6bn yuan (£2.5bn), which it blamed on market volatility. It also warned that the ongoing effects of the pandemic were creating a more “complex, severe, and uncertain” environment for its global business. Some have also speculated that the insurance arm may be considering selling its stake in HSBC to release some cash and find a more lucrative home for its investment. In the meantime, HSBC’s executives are expected to hold their ground when they speak with the insurer later this month. HSBC said: “We believe we’ve got the right strategy and are focused on executing it. Delivering on this strategy is the fastest way to generate higher returns and maximise shareholder value.” Yet while Tucker may be able to douse this fire, the debate over HSBC’s future is not going away.",News/Business,"As tensions rise between east and west, will HSBC be torn apart?",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/as-tensions-rise-between-east-and-west-will-hsbc-be-torn-apart
5/8/2022,"Hard to recall a time when the word “gogglebox” was just quaint slang for a television set, isn’t it? Today the Channel 4 show in which selected families react to a string of TV programmes is a staple of the broadcasting scene. Even people who don’t own a “gogglebox” know about it, possibly because they enjoy snorting derisively at the concept. On Sunday evening, the nine-year-old show is yet again in contention for a TV Bafta at the annual awards ceremony in London. It is nominated as best “reality and constructed factual programme”, a prosaic category that belies the enduring magic of the show. In a good week, Gogglebox could also probably give the nominees in the comedy, entertainment and current affairs shortlists a run for their money. Lee Riley, one of the show’s most popular contributors, with his best friend Jenny Newby, will be there on the night with his fingers crossed. He knows that the show has broadened his knowledge of culture and news, and believes it has done the same for regular viewers. “Loads of my friends say they have binge-watched a whole series or drama because they saw it on Gogglebox,” he told the Observer. “It’s also good for keeping up with what’s going on in the world; I watch a lot more news than I used to now, as well, and am really up on politics.” Peter Bazalgette, the man who brought Big Brother to the screen, makes his admiration for the show clear. He salutes it “as the most brilliant vox pop” due to its clever casting, adding “even its banalities are profound”. “It’s intoxicating. Gogglebox puts its finger on the pulse of the British public like no other programme,” he said. “It’s the Britain we all want to live in; a country engaged and at ease with itself.” Bazalgette, now non-executive chair of ITV, does concede, however, that the show represents perhaps a nostalgic picture of a nation where everyone still watches the same shows. But, he counters, there are still some truly unifying programmes, such as Strictly Come Dancing, or Bake Off, or, indeed, Gogglebox. The Baftas have a special prize for the most memorable, or “must-see”, television moment of the year, which is voted on by the public. Rivals for the honour this time include a terrifying scene from the Korean series Squid Game, presenters Ant and Dec satirising the prime minister, and the dance sequence in which Rose Ayling-Ellis demonstrated her experience of deafness to the audience of Strictly. But the joy of Gogglebox, of course, is that it gives viewers a chance to catch up on all such significant televised moments, with the added piquancy of watching others responding to them. It functions like a digest of topical highlights, drawn from both showbiz and politics. “It is entertaining, but also a roundup of the week,” as Riley sees it. As the world closed in on our own living rooms two years ago, with the dawn of the pandemic, the companionship offered by the Gogglebox participants was even more necessary. Alternately stoic and sceptical, their banter mirrored the national mood. “It helped people getting through the lockdowns. It was like a shared experience and we were going through it together, hopefully making people feel they are not alone and giving them a laugh on a Friday night,” said Riley, who agreed to move in with Newby for the duration, while extra cameras were set up inside Goggleboxers’ homes to keep the show on air. It paid off. Channel 4 reported that April 2020 broke its audience share record. And Britain’s other programme-makers took note. The shows that made headway during the lockdown era were those that took inclusivity as their cue. Channel 4 invited viewers to make art with Grayson Perry, while comedian Romesh Ranganathan zoomed in on his viewers for impromptu chats in BBC Two’s The Ranganation, also up for a Bafta. One of Gogglebox’s key progenitors, Tania Alexander, has wryly recalled how people laughed at her original idea for the show. Channel 4 was accused of running out of ideas. But a ludicrous premise has never stopped a show from becoming a hit. Baking cakes competitively, or making ex-politicians dance, were both surely once outliers. The infamous fictional Alan Partridge lunch in which he suggests both Monkey Tennis and Inner-city Sumo to a TV boss might, in real life, have led to a popular franchise or two. The idea for Gogglebox was not quite so far fetched, Bazalgette argues. “It’s extremely simple. It was staring everyone in the face, because advertisers had been filming people watching television at home for years as research.” The “genius” of producer Stephen Lambert, in Bazalgette’s view, was to recognise how compelling it might be. The second source of inspiration was the hit BBC comedy The Royle Family, which revolved around family television viewing. “Stephen realised a sitcom could be turned into a reality format,” said Bazalgette. The use of, first, the late Caroline Aherne and then, from 2016, Craig Cash as the Gogglebox narrator was a nod to this parentage. Both had been stars of The Royle Family. But not everyone was convinced the new show was coming from a good place. The critic AA Gill detected an unpleasant note of condescension in the handling of “normal people” emanating, he suspected, from the “Tristrams” of the media world. “There’s a very questionable notion of the audience being left to entertain itself. Gogglebox is a parody of The Royle Family, but The Royle Family was brilliantly shot and written,” the late critic once said. “The sum total of us watching people who are a bit odd, or clashes of class or culture, isn’t really that enriching or empathetic.” The cultural commentator Mark Lawson, a fan of the show, sees Bazalgette’s own prizewinning baby Big Brother as a likely influence, as well as George Orwell’s original omnipresent observation state in Nineteen Eighty-Four. “On a distant branch of the TV family tree, Gogglebox could also be seen as an extension of Big Brother, building on to the franchise the TV lounge that the housemates [in that show] were denied,” he said. Alexander, who eventually left the Gogglebox team in November 2020, always looked for reluctant participants. She preferred to persuade people rather than use anyone really keen. And Ian Dunkley, the show’s commissioning editor, says it still works best that way. “Contributors are explicitly cast because they don’t want to achieve fame or become TV personalities outside of the show,” he said on Friday, in a brief break from the edit of the next episode of series 19. “Before anyone appears on the show, they go through a rigorous process that ensures they’re properly prepared for what’s to come,” Dunkley said. “It’s a process that doesn’t end when cast members leave the show: aftercare is also a big priority for us.” But the programme inevitably involves the public in innocent private lives. Ellie Warner from Leeds, who appears on the show with her sister Izzi, has been absent from the show this year as she helps her boyfriend, Nat Eddleston, recover from a serious road accident that made national news. And Gogglebox has made TV stars, of course, such as the sassy Scarlett Moffatt. More recently it has also invited a flock of celebrities to take part on a regularly basis, exposing them to domestic scrutiny. It gives audiences what Dunkley describes as a “unique” peek at “a side to celebrity we don’t normally see”. The actor Denise van Outen’s recent breakup with her fiance, Eddie Boxshall, cannot have been made any easier by the fact so many Gogglebox viewers, accustomed to watching telly with the couple, had strong opinions. Dunkley is proud of its range of voices and views, he says, adding: “There are very few shows on television that feature such a diverse cast of contributors in terms of race, region, class, politics, age and disability – a true plurality of voices.” Yet there is also a sense that the Goggleboxers speak for the nation. Riley testifies that the public usually tell him they agree with his opinion: “Or they laugh along with us, especially if Jenny’s got the wrong end of the stick. Maybe there’s a few politicians that might not like what we’ve said, though.” Last week brought news of a special edition of Celebrity Gogglebox to mark 50 years since the first Pride march in Britain. It will feature DJ Nick Grimshaw and presenter Rylan Clark alongside other British LGBTQ+ personalities. All very warm and cosy-sounding, but the show can still shock and offend. More than 100 viewers complained to Ofcom about a recent episode featuring a clip from Roar, the new drama based on the short stories of Cecelia Ahern. The scene that upset viewers depicted “bestiality”, or at least implied oral sex, between a duck and a young woman: a format that even Alan Partridge might think twice about pitching.",Arts/Television & radio,‘It’s just intoxicating’: why Gogglebox is up for a Bafta ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/07/its-just-intoxicating-why-gogglebox-is-up-for-a-bafta
5/8/2022,"It is questionable how much longer current Covid-19 vaccines will be used as they have largely done their job in preventing mass deaths, and scientists should focus on developing a vaccine that stops transmission of the virus, according to leading scientist Sir John Bell. The huge success of Covid vaccines in countries able to get them has led to sharp declines in deaths and severe disease from the virus, even though the latest Covid variant, Omicron, has spread rapidly. “We need a new vaccine to stop transmissions and there are lots of interesting ideas,” said Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and a former member of the UK vaccine taskforce who has worked on the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jab. “Deaths from the disease, those really awful deaths, had largely been eliminated by the late spring [2021], and they rumbled along, at a very low level and very close to baseline, and they’ve continued to rumble along almost in a flat line since then,” he said. The baseline represents the number of UK deaths that should be expected based on average mortality data before the pandemic. However, the spread of coronavirus remains a problem, leading to hospitalisation of vulnerable people, keeping many off work and leaving a number of people with long-term health issues. Scientists are pinning their hopes on nasal sprays, rather than shots in the arm, which aim to produce strong immune protection in the nose and throat, to block Covid infections at the gates. More than a dozen trials are under way. “It’s an interesting question whether any of the [current] vaccines have a long-term future,” Bell said. “None of them are very good at stopping transmissions,” he said and as variants emerged “they get less good over time” at preventing people becoming sick. “So you’ve got a couple of choices. You can make a new vaccine every time you see a variant and it may be less good than the original vaccine so you end up chasing your tail. You could probably use the existing vaccines to boost the elderly people at some sensible interval, preventing them from dying. We have to wait and see if we do see more deaths in that population … but we haven’t seen them yet.” The Canadian immunologist also said “the booster had no impact on deaths, despite all the rah-rah,” suggesting that two vaccine doses were enough to prevent death and serious illness. “The booster was driven by the perceived need to increase neutralising antibody levels,” he said. “This might have some impact on transmissions and symptoms, although we all know it does not do much for Omicron transmissions, but protection against mortality has other correlates and the death rate in doubly vaccinated people looks very low. Indeed the vast majority of deaths are unvaccinated.” The UK’s current spring booster campaign, the fourth jab, is targeted at the over-75s, care home residents and those who are immunocompromised. Bell is in favour of another round of booster shots in the autumn for those over 65 and vulnerable people with poorer immune systems, but like some other experts, said he saw little point in offering repeat vaccinations to healthy younger people, children and teenagers, unless a more serious Covid variant emerged. He said he was “not massively enthusiastic” about immunising very young children. “Their risk of severe illness is low with Covid and they almost never die. If we had a great transmission blocking vaccine then doing kids would make sense but we don’t. Most of the world is going to get Covid, we need to get used to it.” He estimated a “very high” chance that any new variant will be relatively mild, like Omicron, while the chances of a more lethal variant emerging were “very low but not nothing”. “We need to be on the lookout for a highly pathogenic variant that might start killing people at scale and is evading the vaccine response but we see no sign of that today.”",News/Business,"Vaccine to stop Covid transmission should now be top priority, says leading UK scientist ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/07/vaccine-to-stop-covid-transmission-should-now-be-top-priority-says-leading-uk-scientist

5/8/2022,"One of the few welcome surprises of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was the speed and apparent effectiveness of western governments’ imposition of conventional sanctions on his country. In short order, half of Russia’s $600bn foreign reserves held in western financial institutions was immediately frozen. The country was expelled from Swift, the vast messaging network that banks use to transfer money across the world. PayPal, Visa and Mastercard abruptly ceased to work in Russia. There was an immediate ban on technology transfers from the west. Then there was the sudden sanctioning of Putin-friendly oligarchs and those who service them in London, though Ben Elliot, the Tory co-chair and Quintessentially, the “concierge service” for the super-rich that he runs, seem to have been exempted from the strictures. Trebles all round, then? Only up to a point: some of the successes involve measures that in other contexts are deeply toxic. Russian troops, for example, have been nabbing high-end John Deere tractors in Ukraine and shipping them back to Mother Russia. But when the lucky beneficiaries of these wondrous machines attempt to start them up, they discover that John Deere has remotely “bricked” them – ie turned them into multi-ton paperweights. Which is why many western farmers detest John Deere. Having paid a fortune for their new tractors, they find that they are not allowed to repair them themselves and any attempt to download bootleg software to diagnose malfunctions may get them into legal trouble on intellectual-property and user-agreement grounds. Similarly, Ukraine has been using another toxic technology – facial recognition – to identify dead Russian soldiers. Forbes magazine reported in March that Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine and minister of digital transformation, had confirmed on his Telegram channel that the country was using the software to find the social media accounts of deceased Russian soldiers, allowing authorities to contact their friends and families. The aim, he said, is to dispel misinformation surrounding the war in the country and, specifically, Russian claims that it is just a special operation with few losses. He did not specify which particular technology had been used, but his department later confirmed to Forbes that it was Clearview AI, which the American firm had provided to the Ukrainian government free of charge. So what’s the problem? Only that Clearview AI, a company backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, among others, is pretty controversial back home. In February, a group of US senators and representatives issued a call to federal agencies to avoid using its “particularly dangerous” technology, which “poses unique threats to Black communities, other communities of colour and immigrant communities”. Thus technology taketh away and technology also giveth, as the Old Testament might put it. But the tech that is suddenly on everyone’s mind in relation to sanctions and Russia is blockchain, the software that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and the like. These currencies have been proliferating like wildfire for some years, and I long ago lost count of them all, but in essence they all have one thing in common: they’re decentralised payment systems that can enable anyone to transfer value to someone else anywhere. And because every part of the process is heavily encrypted and unsupervised by any authoritative institution such as a central bank, cryptocurrencies are clearly useful for money laundering – and for evading sanctions. Whatever else it is, Russia seems to be a crypto-savvy country. An official government estimate puts local holdings of cryptocurrencies at $200bn, which is, at a guess, 12% of the world total. Another survey, by a Singapore-based crypto payment gateway, concluded that 17 million Russians own cryptocurrencies and that upwards of half a million computer programmers work in the industry. And Russia is currently third in terms of Bitcoin network-mining activity – apparently with government backing; Putin has called for the use of surplus energy for crypto mining. Given that, it would be surprising if the regime did not have a strategy for using cryptocurrencies as a way of dodging or undermining sanctions. This would be a viable option for individual Russian citizens seeking to trade with others outside the country (or even to protect their savings at a time when the rouble has crashed). But for an economy the size of Russia, crypto transactions on the scale required to offset the impact of sanctions would be much too large to conceal from western governments.

5/8/2022,"Aidan O’Brien’s remarkable run through first week of trials for the Epsom Classics continued here on Saturday as United Nations, the 9-4 second-favourite, stayed on strongly up the home straight to beat Walk Of Stars, the favourite, in the Lingfield Derby Trial and earn a quote of around 10-1 for the Classic on 4 June. Natural World, a stable-companion of Walk Of Stars, was on his toes before the start and sprinted into the lead from the off, with United Nations settling in behind and William Buick, on Walk Of Stars, unable to get any cover on the outside in third. Natural World was still in front around the home turn but Ryan Moore soon stoked up United Nations – a 50-1 chance for the Derby on Saturday morning – to run him down and take charge. Walk Of Stars managed to close the gap under strong driving from his rider but also started to hang badly inside the final furlong and was still three-quarters of a length down at the line. “Ryan was delighted with him,” Paul Smith, the son of United Nations’ co-owner, Derrick, said afterwards. “The trip suited, the conditions suited, he was very complimentary. The attitude’s there, he’s got the pedigree for a championship race and he’ll be in the mix now with all the other horses.” Plumpton 1.40 Alioski 2.15 Mystical Clouds 2.50 Mr Woody 3.25 Slate House 4.00 Sainte Doctor 4.30 Sami Bear 5.00 Wick Green 5.30 El Muchacho Ludlow 2.05 Leylak 2.40 The Wild Wild Sea 3.10 Eminent Poet 3.40 Sofia’s Rock 4.10 Barden Bella 4.40 Tikitov 5.10 You Name Him Hamilton Park 3.50 Kind Spirit 4.18 Nordhalla 4.48 King Triton (nb) 5.18 Sound Reason 5.48 Aasser (nap) 6.18 Captain Haddock 6.45 Life On The Rocks This latest success in a Derby trial leaves O’Brien with no fewer than six of the nine horses currently quoted at 16-1 or below for the Epsom Classic.

O’Brien is also due to saddle Stone Age (14-1) in Ireland’s main Derby trial at Leopardstown on Sunday and has four entries in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday including Point Lonsdale (14-1), 10th of 15 behind Coroebus in the 2,000 Guineas last month.",Sport/Sport,United Nations wins at Lingfield as O’Brien’s Derby trial run goes on,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/united-nations-win-lingfield-obrien-derby-trial-horse-raccing
5/8/2022,"A patient is being treated at a specialist unit in London after they were diagnosed with monkeypox, a rare viral infection. The person had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the illness, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Saturday. They are being treated in an isolation unit at Guy’s and St Thomas’ infectious disease unit. Although monkeypox can be spread during close contact with an infected person, the agency said it did not spread easily and most people recovered in a few weeks. As a precaution, the UKHSA said its experts were working closely with the NHS and would be contacting those who may have had close contact with the person, including some passengers who were on the same flight. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other areas of the body. The rash progresses through different states until it forms a scab which falls off. Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said: “It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.” He added: “UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.” Dr Nicholas Price, director of NHSE high consequence infection diseases (airborne) network and consultant in infectious diseases at Guy’s and St Thomas’, said: “The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas’ hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.” The NHS said infection could be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa and was believed to be spread by rodents. Only a few people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK, all of whom had either travelled to west Africa or been in close contact with somebody who had. According to Public Health England, monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a “pox-like disease” were found in monkeys in captivity for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since then, it said, most cases have been reported from DRC and Nigeria, but there have been a handful of cases further afield. In 2003, cases were recorded in humans and pet prairie dogs in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. In December 2019, a patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, which PHE said was the fourth case diagnosed in the UK since the first imported cases the year before. There have also been cases in Israel and Singapore.",News/UK news,Patient treated for monkeypox in isolation at London hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/patient-treated-for-monkeypox-in-isolation-at-london-hospital
