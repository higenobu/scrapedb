3/10/2022,"A plane carrying former US president Donald Trump was reportedly forced to make an emergency landing on Saturday night after suffering engine failure over the Gulf of Mexico. The Dassault Falcon 900 had flown about 75 miles from a New Orleans airport before turning back to the city, an unnamed source told the Reuters news agency. The plane had been taking Trump back to his luxury Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, from a New Orleans hotel where he addressed Republican party donors at a private event. Other passengers included Secret Service agents, support staff and some advisers to Trump. The aircraft turned around just before 11pm. The Politico website, which first reported the incident, cited a source as saying that audio of communications between the pilot and the air traffic control tower revealed that the landing was described as “emergency in nature”. The plane belonged to a donor who loaned it to the former president for the evening, and Trump advisers secured another donor’s plane to take him back to Florida. He landed in Palm Beach at around 3am on Sunday. At the event in New Orleans, Trump delivered a discursive and bizarre 84-minute speech, musing that US should put the Chinese flag on F-22 jets and “bomb the shit out of Russia” as payback for the invasion of Ukraine. “And then we say, ‘China did it, we didn’t do it, China did it,’ and then they start fighting with each other and we sit back and watch,” he told a laughing audience. Trump also teased a presidential run in 2024, remarking: “We are looking at it very, very strongly. We have to do it. We have to do it.” He is likely to be airborne again on Saturday when he holds a rally in Florence, South Carolina, along with Governor Henry McMaster and the congressional candidates Russell Fry and Katie Arrington.",News/US news,Plane carrying Trump reportedly made emergency landing after engine failure,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/09/donald-trump-plane-emergency-landing
3/10/2022,"Musician Kate Miller-Heidke has revealed that she was sexually abused as a child by her great-grandfather, saying she had felt inspired by activists Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins and musician Jaguar Jonze to share her story with the world. In a statement published on Thursday morning, Miller-Heidke wrote of the abuse while announcing a reissue of her recent song You Can’t Hurt Me Anymore as a duet with Jonze, an outspoken campaigner against sexual misconduct. “I usually say this song is about dancing on the grave of an arsehole,” Miller-Heidke wrote. “My latest album Child in Reverse is about childhood. One thing that happened to me when I was a very young child (from the ages of 4-6) was that I was sexually abused by my great grandfather Archibald Barnes. He was a paedophile and a serial offender. I wasn’t the first or the last. (Although obviously my family didn’t know it at the time, and didn’t find out until some years later.) “This song is about how I felt when he died. Ultimately it’s a really empowering song to sing.” The 40-year-old singer said she felt she could now speak out because of “the examples of Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins”, but called Jonze “the most important inspiration”. Miller-Heidke said she spoke to Jonze the morning she wrote You Can’t Hurt Me Anymore, which was first released in October but has now been remixed to become a duet between the two women. “[Jonze] described some very shocking things that happened to her as a child, and I felt very connected to her, and full of admiration for her resilience too – that’s when the song title You Can’t Hurt Me Anymore popped into my head,” Miller-Heidke wrote, calling it “one of the most powerful songs I’ve written”. Jonze, real name Deena Lynch, said in a statement on Thursday morning that she at first did not know the song was based on the conversation they’d had years before. “Back then I had no platform and less power, so to have had this impact on Kate really is testament to the momentum that is created when we speak out and share our stories and experiences,” she said. “I am honoured she invited me to sing and create a reworked version of the song alongside my band. It was a precious opportunity for us both to channel our pain, resilience and triumphs through what we love – music, art and honest storytelling. “I stand with Kate for being so strong and finding her voice. It’s my hope that by sharing these experiences, others will be encouraged to speak out, so that we can continue breaking down walls as survivors and make a stand that we will no longer tolerate abuse any more.” Jonze has previously publicly alleged that she was sexually assaulted in 2019, and has been a leading voice of Australia’s #metoo movement. In the song, Miller-Heidke sings: “We’re so good at hiding bruises / We’re so good at feeling shame / When you’re tiny, no one listens / Nobody will name the name.” “I cried a bit,” she said of writing You Can’t Hurt Me Anymore. “I had never written directly about this before, and it was cathartic.” Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636; 1800-RESPECT on 1800 737 732.",Arts/Music,Kate Miller-Heidke reveals she was sexually abused as a child,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/10/kate-miller-heidke-reveals-she-was-sexually-abused-as-a-child
3/10/2022,"David Moyes has said that West Ham will back themselves to cause an upset when they face Sevilla in the last 16 of the Europa League. West Ham face a daunting task after being drawn against Sevilla, who have won this competition six times, but Moyes is confident that his side will approach tonight’s first leg at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan Stadium with a positive attitude. “I feel it is where the players should be,” West Ham’s manager said. “The group we have are capable. There are times this season where it does not matter who we play, we will get a win. I see this as a great game for us. “Sevilla have a really good history in the competition. It is two legs – we have this one and we are looking forward to the London Stadium next week. You want to play in Europe. It is the elite to challenge yourself against. “Our effort last year is why we are in this position. We wanted the best teams, to challenge them and see how we do.” Moyes said that he wants West Ham, who are sixth in the Premier League, to compete regularly at this level. “I expect them to win whoever we play – Chelsea, Liverpool or Man City, I expect them to win and am disappointed when we do not,” the Scot said. “I want to be a new West Ham that qualifies for Europe and challenges the top teams. This time last year I thought Europe was a possibility. Prior to that we were avoiding relegation. That was the job. We have become a team challenging for Europe. We have moved a big amount in a short time. Tomorrow is a different level.” West Ham will be without Jarrod Bowen after the forward limped off during last weekend’s defeat to Liverpool, but Declan Rice has travelled to Spain after recovering from illness. “He trained today for the first time,” Moyes said. “He was very unwell but he is with us and if fit he will play.” Moyes urged his forwards to sharpen up after missing several chances during West Ham’s defeats to Liverpool and Southampton. “In the last two games we felt if we had the finishing we would have been through in the FA Cup and had a great chance to take something from Anfield,” he said. “I think there have been some good signs from Michail Antonio that he is on his way back. He is so important to how the team plays, but we need those goals.” Sevilla, who are second in La Liga, have several injury concerns. Anthony Martial is expected to be fit but Erik Lamela, Diego Carlos, Gonzalo Montiel, Papu Gómez, Fernando and Suso could miss out.
