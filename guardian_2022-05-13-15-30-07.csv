5/13/2022,"Trish has never been seen in public before. Nor have Sharon, Janet, Debbie, Denise, Donna, Jacqui, Joanne, Kim, Lorraine, Mandy, Paula, Sandra or Tina. But for the next two weeks, these 14 artworks by the pop star Robbie Williams and his creative partner Ed Godrich will be on display at Sotheby’s in central London. Their curious titles – all women’s names that were popular back when Williams was a Stoke-on-Trent schoolboy – are not the artworks’ only common factor. The large-scale black and white images, the fruits of a five-year collaboration, are strikingly thematic. “Robbie and Ed refer to the paintings as a family of work,” said Hugo Cobb, a contemporary art specialist at Sotheby’s. “They are all created in the same visual language. But when you stand in front of them, you see they have a different character. Each picture definitely has a specific visual mood. “Coherence, ambition and authenticity are the three things I think of when I stand in front of these works.” Another painting from the same group, Beverly, was sold by Sotheby’s last month for £40,000 – double the top end of the pre-sale estimate – to a private foundation in Central America. Williams said the pair were now “ready to share our creative vision with the world”. He wanted people to “feel a sense of positivity … to be intrigued, to feel curious, and spot new characteristics every time they look back at each painting.” Using the moniker Williams Godrich, the collaborators painted the 14 works on huge polystyrene panels – a medium that gives them a “unique texture”, said Cobb – building up layers of detail. “All the characters are in our head and come to life as the painting develops,” said Godrich. “Sometimes a character will emerge by mistake, or part of a figurine will happen by chance because of the direction of a particular brushstroke. “Robbie might see something completely different when it’s his turn to draw; that’s why our work takes on multiple narratives. He’ll add a bit and I’ll add a bit until we end up with a completely unique being.” According to Williams, the paintings’ titles came about because “we like the obscurity of these names which were highly popular back in the day but are not so common now. For us they are names that define the 1980s, an influential era which has inspired our art.” In a Sotheby’s video, he said his interest in art had been sparked by album covers. “I didn’t realise they were art at the time, I was just intrigued by the images in front of me … So I guess my first love of art was through music.” He and Godrich had formed an “art band”, he added. Art was “a great experiment for me to be creative in a different vehicle”. Williams, who has amassed a huge fortune from record sales and concerts, has built up a personal art collection. This year he sold two works by Banksy for a total of £7m. The sales were intended to free up space to be able to buy “new art from new people” and help fund his own work, he said. Cobb said the Williams Godrich debut was an exciting moment. “Robbie and Ed are very serious about this. This is not a one-off project – they’ve put a huge amount of energy and time into their work. As to their future collectability, it remains to be seen.”  Black and White Paintings by Robbie Williams and Ed Godrich is at Sotheby’s, 35 New Bond Street, London W1S 2RP, until 25 May.",Arts/Music,Sotheby’s debut of Robbie Williams’ art puts Sharon and Trish on show ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/13/robbie-williams-ed-godrich-sothebys-art-exhibition
5/13/2022,"This atmospheric, noir-ish thriller is loosely based on the real life of American journalist Jake Adelstein (Ansel Elgort) who worked the Tokyo crime beat in the 90s. We begin with Adelstein facing down a roomful of extremely threatening criminals, then rewind a couple of years to learn his origin story. He is the first foreigner on the paper and instantly gains the nickname “Mossad” as it’s assumed he’s a Jewish spy. His ambition leads him into conflict but he’s charismatic and tenacious. Michael Mann’s direction of the pilot does a fine job of communicating both Adelstein’s fish-out-of-water status and the pressure-cooker intensity of his environment.

5/13/2022,"Good morning. The UK is holding negotiations with the EU about parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, and if that feels like deja vu, that’s because it is. After six years of deadlocks, impasses and stalemates, it feels like politics has gone back to square one. First, the Democratic Unionist party said it would not join the power-sharing assembly at Stormont without changes to the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. Then foreign secretary Liz Truss said yesterday that unless the EU gives way she will have “no choice but to act” during a “tetchy” conversation with Maroš Šefčovič, the vice-president of the European Commission. The decision to contest the protocol has caused some diplomatic alarm: the US is so concerned that it is sending an emergency delegation to London, the Guardian reports today. Officials in Brussels are said to be “flabbergasted” and there’s even concern within Truss’s own party. But at least one man is calm. In the Telegraph, former Brexit minister David Frost writes that Boris Johnson should just rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol – and even compared it to the prime minister’s handling of the war in Ukraine. So. A lot going on. To make sense of it all, I spoke to the Guardian’s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll. First, here are the headlines. Nato | Finland must apply to join Nato without delay, the country’s president and prime minister have said. After decades of military non-alignment, the Nordic country made the historic move in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Partygate | More than 100 fixed-penalty notices have now been handed out for breaches of lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall, the Metropolitan police said. Boris Johnson is understood to not be among those in a new set of fines. Climate crisis | The world’s leading energy economist has warned against investing in “carbon bomb” oil and gas developments. After the publication of a Guardian investigation, Fatih Birol of the IEA called for a “cleaner and more secure energy system”. Covid | Six people have died amid an “explosive” spread of fever, North Korean state media has announced, a day after it admitted for the first time ever that an outbreak of Covid had occurred. Politics | Boris Johnson has demanded that ministers reduce their staff to free up cash to spend on the cost of living crisis. 90,000 jobs in the civil service could be cut. It’s been over two years since Boris Johnson signed the EU withdrawal agreement, and celebrated an achievement which had eluded Theresa May. That victory was rooted in what he claimed was a “great deal” for Northern Ireland – a special arrangement which avoided a trade-and-customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland by putting one in the Irish Sea instead. The Northern Ireland protocol, as it became known, was presented by Johnson as conclusive. But always lurking was an uncertainty that has arisen again this week. Here’s a guide to what’s happening: Brexit is back – again Not that it ever really went away. After a hiatus due to the war in Ukraine, negotiations with the EU about the protocol have resumed and foreign secretary Liz Truss has come out swinging, threatening to unilaterally scrap important sections of the protocol if the EU does not show the “requisite flexibility”. The EU has said previously that there will be severe and immediate consequences, at worst a trade war, if the UK were to go through with something like this. That would have serious consequences for the whole of the UK – but especially Northern Ireland, where a new government is yet to form at Stormont after last week’s elections. Sinn Féin’s victory In a historic victory last week, Sinn Féin became the biggest party in the Stormont assembly, winning 29% of the vote. It’s a seismic moment for the party, Rory Carroll says, because for the first time in Northern Ireland’s 101-year history, a nationalist party has emerged triumphant. This victory is largely “symbolic and psychological”, Rory explains, “and in the Northern Ireland context that’s really important: symbolism has an exaggerated impact”. Rory calls Sinn Féin’s victory “a wake up call” for the DUP, because it will boost Sinn Féin’s campaign for a referendum on the unification of Ireland. “Not in the short term,” he adds. “We’re looking at least a medium term, five years, probably more before that may happen, if it happens.” For most people, however, life will continue as normal: “this makes no real meaningful difference in the day to day because Sinn Féin have been in government for 15 years in Northern Ireland and will continue to be”. Despite the importance politically for Sinn Féin’s leader to move from deputy first minister to putative first minister, the roles have identical powers. “One can’t order a toasted sandwich without the other signing off on that,” Rory says. So in practical terms, it should not make any difference to the running of Northern Ireland. But one part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement could derail that altogether. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? As the EU has border checks when certain goods, particularly food, arrive from non-EU countries, when the UK voted to leave there was a major problem – what happens between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland? Putting a border in place would threaten the Good Friday Agreement, something both sides have stressed their commitment to protecting. And so the Northern Ireland protocol was born – instead of border checks happening between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, they were to happen between Northern Ireland and Great Britain instead. It was an imperfect solution to an impossible problem, but the protocol was enshrined in international law. Rory wrote a great explainer on what it is, why it matters and what it will mean for the future of Northern Ireland. What does this mean for Northern Ireland? The Democratic Unionist party has two main problems with the Northern Ireland protocol, Rory tells me: it’s hurting Northern Ireland’s economy and it undermines its position in the UK, by creating a de facto border between Northern Ireland and Britain. And so, in response, the DUP has said that it will block the formation of a power-sharing administration unless Downing Street radically changes the protocol. If this were to happen, it would send Northern Ireland into a political crisis, creating what Rory has described as a “zombified form of local government”. Some ministers from the outgoing executive would stay on – but with much reduced responsibilities and powers. “They kind of keep the lights on, just about, but they cannot make any major decisions or launch new initiatives.” Northern Ireland is pretty familiar with this set up: in 2017 Sinn Féin blocked power sharing over a dispute with the DUP and Stormont was suspended for three years. In January, it was the DUP’s turn to press the stop button and suspend the executive. This means constraints on spending because there’s nobody to sign crucial budgetary decisions. A government that can barely function means that the public are left in the lurch: “Northern Ireland’s got a serious health care crisis,” Rory says, “it’s got some of the worst waiting lists and health metrics in the UK. There’s a consensus in Northern Ireland that healthcare is a disaster and needs urgent attention.” So when rumblings of another government shutdown surfaced, health care professionals started to panic. “We’ve had a joint statement from five medical organisations, including the British Medical Association Northern Ireland and the Royal College of GPs, where they are pleading with politicians in Northern Ireland to form an executive because if they don’t, they say, it will compound the crisis in healthcare and will risk the lives of patients.” Rory tells me. “That’s how high the stakes are.” It’s a dilemma: on the one hand, a stable government in Northern Ireland depends on some revision to the Northern Ireland protocol. But on the other, threatening to withdraw unilaterally risks the economy for the entirety of the UK. And in the midst of all this political noise, one thing is clear: the people on the sharp end of this political paralysis are the public.

Archie Rebekah Vardy endured another day of cross-examination at the hands of Coleen Rooney’s barrister, David Sherborne, yesterday – admitting that she knew her agent, Caroline Watt, had forwarded private information about Rooney to the Sun in the past, and accused of “throwing her under the bus” to protect herself. Jim Waterson, reporting from the high court, witnessed Vardy’s grilling – including an excrutiating exchange about the nature of the watery grave her agent’s mobile phone had ended up in, a rather terse response to an everyday colloquialism and a debate about the nature of the 😂 emoji. At one point Rooney’s barrister described a WhatsApp message in a conversation between Vardy and Watt that included the words “poor Coleen” followed by “laughing emojis”. Vardy told the court she disputed this characterisation: “I don’t know whether they’re laughing emojis.” The lawyer, in an apparent reference to the 😂 emoji, replied: “OK, crying with laughter.” Cricket | Brendon McCullum has been confirmed as the new coach of England’s men’s Test team.

5/13/2022,"A review that criticised the format of Channel Nine’s leaders’ debate was spiked by Tory Maguire, the executive editor of Nine Entertainment’s newspapers the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Maguire has editorial control of the national content in the two mastheads, and she has confirmed she spiked the piece by senior culture writer Karl Quinn, but not for the reasons some staff feared. “The original brief for Karl’s piece, about how the shoutyness of the debate might alienate young viewers, ended up being very similar to a separately commissioned piece by Jess Irvine,” Maguire told Weekly Beast. “We ended up with too many takes on one topic, which is something we try to avoid. We also covered commentary on the tone of the debate in our news coverage. Spiking stories is not that unusual, especially on a fast-moving news day when there are lots of people commissioning.” While Irvine’s article did mention the debate’s “generally ill-tempered tone”, it was largely an analysis of what was said from an economic perspective. After all, Irvine is an economics correspondent. Quinn’s review tackled the debate as a piece of television, arguing it failed on several fronts as the men talked over each other. Sources say he filed it around midday on Monday and it never appeared. The two venerable newspapers, whose motto is “independent always”, teamed up with Nine News, 60 Minutes and 2GB for Sunday night’s television spectacle in what was a very public display of a sometimes uneasy media alliance formed in 2018, when Fairfax merged with Nine. “For all the post-event pearl clutching from some commentators who disliked Sunday night’s heat-and-fury leaders’ debate, Channel Nine’s viewers seemed to find it compelling enough to stay the course.” https://t.co/Z2BVLkXOH6 “This was the first time ever we have combined the power of Nine as the biggest media group in the country with the experience of Nine’s journalists across our broadcast television, publishing, radio and digital platforms for this 60 Minutes special event,” Nine’s news director Darren Wick told staff on Monday. “Sarah Abo, from 60 Minutes, Chris Uhlmann from Nine News, Deborah Knight representing Nine Radio (3AW; 4BC, 2GB, 6PR) and David Crowe, from The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald made a formidable combination.” ‘The complaint about the paltry “60-second slivers” featured in what ranks as the performance art piece of outrage thundered at Nine’s debate by The Guardian.’ https://t.co/0P8lD1aKiZ Among the many critical voices was Nine’s own 2GB broadcaster Ben Fordham: “It wasn’t great. It was a shambles. It was messy, disjointed, awkward. All over the shop.” He didn’t go as far as the Guardian’s Katharine Murphy, who was critical of the format, not the host, and wrote on Sunday night: “It’s hard to find words for how terrible that second leaders’ debate was. A genuine shit blizzard. It was the Jerry Springer of leaders’ debates.” Nine's Great Debate audience peaked at 1.178 million and averaged 904,000. Another 70,000 on 9Now. Youtube accounts hit 814,000 engagements, Facebook, 1.2 million views and 250,000 views on Twitter. That does not include SMH and Age streaming or audiences on 3AW, 4BC, 2GB and 6PR While Quinn’s take never appeared, the SMH and the Age did publish an extraordinary piece by Nine’s political editor Chris Uhlmann the next day. Uhlmann was one on a panel of three questioners with David Crowe and Deborah Knight for the debate, which may explain this swipe at Guardian Australia: “It is odd that an organ [Guardian Australia] so angrily post-Christian behaves so much like the medieval church, because it has appointed itself the guardian of the constantly shifting sands of modern virtue, and routinely conducts witch-hunts,” Uhlmann wrote. “It is also so disconnected from Australia’s sources of wealth, food and power that it spends most of its time campaigning to shut them down.” It’s good to know the cartoonists are still free to express their views at the SMH and Age. Trying to follow the leaders pic.twitter.com/qnFzHjKsWW After all the criticism of Nine’s debate, Seven had a roadmap for what not to do. Seven political editor Mark Riley stood close to the two leaders and kept a tight rein on them, resulting in a respectful and sober affair. The debate’s numbers were slightly below Nine’s, which is not surprising given the later time slot and a very poor lead-in from Big Brother, but Seven and Riley were widely praised for their efforts by gallery veterans Barrie Cassidy, Laura Tingle, David Speers and Paul Bongiorno. On the back of her views about trans women in sport, the Liberal party’s Warringah candidate Katherine Deves has become a major player in the media’s coverage of the election campaign. Deves is the eighth-most mentioned candidate, according to media monitoring, ahead of Labor frontbenchers Penny Wong and Jason Clare and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, and that is despite refusing most media requests for interviews. Deves did appear on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday after sitting down with normally London-based reporter Latika Bourke for a chat, in which she “repeatedly burst into tears” and spoke of “dark moments”. ""Polling has shown that the overwhelming majority of Australians agree with my position on women’s sport. I would say to those other candidates they’re not reading the room.""My interview with this election's most controversial candidate, Katherine Deves:https://t.co/WOKRLQJJkp The Age ran the story not on page one but inside, over two pages, under the headline “Tears and ‘dark moments’ but Deves fights on”. The Liberal candidate spelled out all the pain she has suffered since her divisive tweets were uncovered. “It’s really debased the electoral process — people should be able to speak their minds and engage and put their hands up for public office without their safety or their children’s safety put at risk,” Deves told the SMH. Among the criticism of Bourke’s piece is that Deves does not identify what polling she is relying on to back up her claim that the majority of Australians agree with her position on trans women in sport. “I would highly doubt” https://t.co/102m0twaa9 In the same newspaper a day earlier, political commentator Niki Savva said senior Liberals accused Morrison of “abandoning progressive Liberals and using Deves to chase conservative Christians or people of other faiths”. The Nine papers may have helped that cause, giving Deves such sympathetic exposure a week before the polls. The Sydney Morning Herald declined to comment when approached about the story. Not long after we published our piece about Sky News presenter Paul Murray unleashing a foul-mouthed tirade against Labor at Eatons Hill Hotel in Brisbane, Murray’s 8pm show came on Sky News on Thursday evening. While Murray did not dignify us with a mention, his regular Labor party guest Nicholas Reece did. Reece, the deputy lord mayor of Melbourne city council, was aware of what Murray had said about him on Tuesday night in the leaked audio but he was happy to roll with the punches. In the audio, after Murray’s audience said they didn’t like the Labor guests Reece or Stephen Conroy, Murray laughed and said Reece was like a “blow-up clown doll”, meaning he gets knocked down and always comes back for more, adding: “He thinks he’s doing God’s work”. After saying hello to Murray on Thursday’s program, Reece smiled and said he was happy to be on the show “doing God’s work”. Murray did not bite. The Liberal party has not responded to multiple attempts by Crikey journalists to secure an invitation to its campaign launch in Brisbane on Sunday. The managing editor of Crikey’s owner Private Media, Peter Fray, is unimpressed by the cold shoulder. Crikey were fierce critics of Tony Abbott before the 2010 and 2013 campaigns, but his team had no problem with us attending events (or returning our calls). @TurnbullMalcolm's team went out of their way to ensure we had access. But persona non grata now. “Like all journalists, Crikey has a vested interest in seeing democracy at work,” Fray told Weekly Beast. “Sure, we’ve published some robust things about the PM and senior ministers. We are not alone in that. That’s our job and that’s no reason to ban us from the Liberal launch. There is no justification for stopping us from doing our job. The PM’s media team needs to remember that journalism isn’t propaganda. Unless Australia has slipped from democracy to autocracy.” Former ABC staff have been mobilising this election, under the banner ABC Alumni, producing a series of videos encouraging people to consider the ABC’s future when they vote.

The ABC asked the alumni to remove several screenshots of ABC correspondents from the video as they breached rules on the use of ABC content in election advertising.
