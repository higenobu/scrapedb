3/3/2022,"Simon & Garfunkel once described a scenario in which ""friends just can't be found,"" and one can easily imagine that, following Wednesday's United Nations vote condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin and company might find solace in listening to ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" on repeat. According to The New York Times, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning Russian aggression, with 141 countries voting in favor, 34 abstaining, and only five voting against. The result matched the international outpouring of support for Ukraine seen around the world in the past week. Pro-Ukraine demonstrations sprang up in London, Madrid, Milan, Paris, Tokyo, Seoul, Cape Town, and several other cities. During President Biden's State of the Union address on Tuesday, many lawmakers waved small Ukrainian flags or wore Ukrainian flag pins. The no votes on the resolution came from five authoritarian nations: Russia, North Korea, Eritrea, Syria, and Russia's close ally Belarus. The Cato Institute's 2020 Human Freedom Index ranks Russia as the 115th freest country on earth. Belarus barely cracks the top 100 at 99th. Syria appears on the list as the 10th least free country in the world. North Korea and Eritrea, both one-party dictatorships, are not ranked at all. Among the nations that abstained from the vote were Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, and China. In early February, China and Russia released a joint statement that, among other things, condemned NATO expansion but did not directly mention Ukraine.

3/3/2022,"Irked by the sight of students wearing masks at his press conference Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis encouraged them to remove the facial coverings, calling their use “COVID theater.” ""You do not have to wear those masks,” DeSantis said in video captured by WFLA News Channel 8, Tampa’s NBC station. “Please take them off. Honestly, it's not doing anything. We've gotta stop with this Covid theater. So if you wanna wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.""

So if you wanna wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.""https://t.co/7j1Pb2hV53 @WFLA pic.twitter.com/ZIOyTHLOh3 — Evan Donovan (@EvanDonovan) March 2, 2022 DeSantis then shakes his head in apparent frustration before launching into the press conference at the University of South Florida, which he visited to tout $20 million in funding for cybersecurity training. At least two people removed their masks at the governor's request, according to the video. The governor has outlawed mask mandates in Florida schools. His remarks to the students is evidence of his disdain for even voluntary mask-wearing, and distrust of the science behind it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new mask guidance last week that no longer recommends indoor mask wearing for most people in many parts of the country - places where the “COVID-19 community level” is considered low or medium. The CDC still considers much of Florida – including the Tampa area where DeSantis was visiting Wednesday – to have a high COVID-19 community level, though, and recommends everyone wear masks indoors in these areas when in public spaces. DeSantis also continued to blame President Joe Biden for the Russian invasion of Ukraine during the press event, while praising the country's fighters Wednesday and taking a dig at France. DeSantis said Russian President Vladimir Putin likely decided to invade Ukraine after witnessing how the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan played out. ""I believe that the decision to go into Ukraine was one that was probably made last summer as he's watching what was happening in Afghanistan... how Biden handled that,"" DeSantis said during an event in Tampa.

DeSantis attacks President Biden over Ukraine but praises Trump In February: DeSantis gets a lot of love at CPAC event in Orlando but not from Trump DeSantis has echoed Ukraine talking points adopted by many GOP leaders, blaming Biden for the invasion and calling for more energy production in the United States to limit the leverage Putin has because of the world's reliance on Russian oil and gas. The governor also touched on the Ukrainian resistance Wednesday. “When you see people that are willing to fight, I mean it’s inspiring to see these people just grab rifles who are civilians and going out there and fighting to ward off the Russian Army,"" DeSantis said. ""A lot of other places around the world, they just fold the minute there’s any type of adversity. I mean could you imagine if they went into France, would they do anything to put up a fight? Probably not.” Last week, on the day Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine, DeSantis criticized ""authoritarian rule"" in places such as Canada and Australia that have more restrictive COVID-19 public health measures. DeSantis also offered his rebuttal to the State of the Union speech Biden delivered Tuesday.

DeSantis said Biden's policies contributed to inflation and immigration issues, and accused his administration of being soft on crime. “So many of these problems have been created by Biden and his administration since he’s become president,” DeSantis said.

3/3/2022,"(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said at the weekend that his nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert, raising fears that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could lead to nuclear escalation. Here is how Russia's chain of command would work in the event of a nuclear weapon launch. WHO DECIDES TO LAUNCH RUSSIAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS? A 2020 document https://archive.mid.ru/en/web/guest/foreign_policy/international_safety/disarmament/-/asset_publisher/rp0fiUBmANaH/content/id/4152094 called ""Basic Principles of State Policy of the Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence"" says the Russian president takes the decision to use nuclear weapons. A small briefcase, known as the Cheget, is kept close to the president at all times, linking him to the command and control network of Russia's strategic nuclear forces. The Cheget does not contain a nuclear launch button but rather transmits launch orders to the central military command - the General Staff. IF PUTIN GIVES THE NUCLEAR ORDER, WHAT HAPPENS? The Russian General Staff file:///C:/Users/8011323/Downloads/FOIR1588.pdf has access to the launch codes and has two methods of launching nuclear warheads. It can send authorisation codes to individual weapons commanders, who would then execute the launch procedures. There is also a back-up system, known as Perimetr, which allows the General Staff to directly initiate the launch of land-based missiles, bypassing all the immediate command posts. DID PUTIN'S 'HIGH ALERT' ORDER MAKE A LAUNCH MORE LIKELY? Putin said at the weekend that the nation's nuclear forces should be put on high alert. The following day, Russia's defence ministry announced that its nuclear missile forces had been placed on ""enhanced"" combat duty. The phrase enhanced, or special, combat duty does not appear in Russia's nuclear doctrine, leaving military experts puzzled over what it might mean. Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in Geneva, said on Twitter that the order might have activated Russia's nuclear command and control system, essentially opening communication channels for any eventual launch order. Alternatively, he said it might just mean the Russians added staff to their nuclear facilities. DO THE RUSSIANS HAVE RULES ON NUCLEAR LAUNCHES? The 2020 doctrine presents four scenarios which might justify the use of Russian nuclear weapons: -- the use of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction against Russia or its allies; -- data showing the launch of ballistic missiles aimed at Russia or its allies; -- an attack on critical government or military sites that would undermine the country's nuclear forces response actions; -- the use of conventional weapons against Russia ""when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy"". WHAT NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES DOES RUSSIA HAVE? The Federation of American Scientists https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces estimates that Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, more than any other country. Of these, 1,588 are deployed and ready for use. Its missiles can be fired from the land, by submarines and by airplanes. Putin oversaw a coordinated test of Russia's nuclear forces on Feb. 19 shortly before ordering troops into Ukraine. HAS RUSSIA EVER USED A NUCLEAR WEAPON IN WAR? No. To date, the only use of nuclear weapons during conflict was the atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States in 1945, at the end of World War Two.

3/3/2022,"(In first paragraph, planes were rerouted by FAA and not ordered out by Canada. In last paragraph, makes clear NAV's action is only in case of an emergency) (Reuters) - Two Russian flights attempting to enter Canadian airspace on Monday were rerouted by the Federal Aviation Administration, after the planes identified themselves as ""humanitarian"" flights, Canadian air-traffic control service said. Canada banned Russian planes from entering its airspace starting on Sunday as part of severe sanctions imposed on Moscow in response to its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But the same day, an Aeroflot flight AFL111 violated the ban after declaring itself as a humanitarian flight. Under normal circumstances, Canada's air-traffic control service NAV CANADA does not have the authority to deny airspace access to an aircraft declaring itself a humanitarian flight. The other Russian planes that attempted to enter Canadian airspace had departed from U.S. airports. NAV CANADA along with regulator Transport Canada has issued a directive to all air traffic control units to deny all identifiable Russian airplanes access to their airspace. The only exception to this ban is a prior approval by Transport Canada. In the event an emergency has been declared, NAV CANADA is required to direct the aircraft to land at the closest airport, and notifying the regulator.
