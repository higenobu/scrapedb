12/26/2021,"Police in Boulder, Colorado, are marking 25 years since their investigation into the murder of JonBenét Ramsey began. After analyzing more than 1,500 pieces of evidence, including 1,000 DNA samples, investigators have high hopes a DNA match will soon solve the case. ""Thanks to the huge advances in DNA technology, multiple suspects have been run through the system to check for matches,"" police said in a statement. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation updated over 750 reference samples with the latest DNA technology, and officials said that DNA is checked regularly for new matches. This isn't the first time investigators have pinned their hopes on scientific advances. In 2016, new DNA testing was planned after a joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and KUSA-TV reportedly uncovered flaws in the interpretation of previous DNA testing. The beauty queen was six years old when she was reported missing the day after Christmas in 1996. Her family said they found a ransom note inside their home. Her body was later found in a basement room, and an autopsy revealed that the cause of her death was strangulation. JonBenét's parents and her brother Burke, the only ones in the home that night, were previously cleared by DNA evidence. Burke Ramsey, who was 9 years old when his sister died, spoke publicly about her death in for the first time in 2016. He told Dr. Phil McGraw that he felt it was time to talk about her death two decades after the media first swarmed their quiet street in Boulder. ""For a long time the media basically made our lives crazy. It's hard to miss the cameras and news trucks in your front yard and we go to the supermarket sometimes and there would be a tabloid with my picture, JonBenét's picture plastered on the front or they would follow us around,"" said Ramsey. ""Seeing that as a little kid is just kind of a chaotic nightmare, so I was pretty skeptical of any sort of media, it just made me a very private person."" In that interview, he spoke about what he said happened the day his sister was found dead in their basement. ""The first thing I remember is my mom bursting into my room really frantic saying 'Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,' running around my room, now, I know, looking for JonBenét,"" said Ramsey. No one has ever been charged in her killing. JonBenét's father John Ramsey, who appeared in the Discovery+ documentary ""JonBenét Ramsey: What Really Happened?"", told USA Today earlier this year that the family is ""hoping somebody will come forward with some information that will be helpful."" According to the Boulder Police Department, its major crimes unit has ""received, reviewed or investigated more than 21,016 tips, letters and emails and detectives have traveled to 19 states to interview or speak with more than 1,000 individuals in connection to this crime.""

12/26/2021,"One day after a homeowner fatally shot an intruder who assaulted him and his wife, residents along Green Springs Road near Abbottstown are reeling from the attack in their quiet neighborhood. ""I never did think anything like this would happen,"" neighbor Roy Reed said. State police say 54-year-old Steven David Shaffer, who lived on Green Springs Road, entered an elderly couple's home on the same street and assaulted them. The husband fatally shot Shaffer during the attack. The wife suffered critical injuries, and a helicopter flew her to York Hospital for treatment. Her husband was taken by ambulance to the same medical facility. State police did not have an update Thursday on their conditions and have not released their names. Reed, who has lived in the neighborhood for 35 years, said he knows both the victims and Shaffer. The couple enjoys riding bicycles, and he'd see them go up and down the road. Shaffer has done work for him, Reed said. He needed a door put on a trailer, and Shaffer did it. ""He seemed like a decent guy,"" he said. Before the attack, state police received numerous calls saying that a man was acting erratically the 800 block of Green Springs Road in Berwick Township. He was trying to enter a home and was banging on cars on the rural road, forcing traffic to stop. While troopers were responding to the scene, Shaffer, who was wearing only a shirt, entered the couple's home in the 900 block of Green Springs Road and started assaulting the husband. The husband told his wife to retrieve a gun from the bedroom. Shaffer followed and attacked her. The husband managed to get the revolver and shot Shaffer, who died at the scene. Property records show Shaffer lived in the same block as the couple. However, state police said the victims did not know him. Reed said he hasn't heard an update on how his neighbors are doing. ""I just hope they're alright,"" he said. Another neighbor who also said she knew both the victims and Shaffer declined to comment. State police did not have any new details Thursday on the ongoing investigation into the attack and shooting. Terry Bankert, who lives farther down the road, described it as a quiet neighborhood and said many of the residents keep to themselves. In the 10 years he's lived there, this is the first incident he's aware of. It's a shame, he said, that residents have to lock their doors while they are at home. And Bankert feels sorry for the couple who was beaten. With an older person, he said, it only takes one punch. ""I'm glad he had a gun,"" he said. ""He did the right thing.""

12/26/2021,"LONDON (AP) — Queen Elizabeth II in her Christmas Day message shared the pain she felt after the death of her husband as she encouraged people everywhere to celebrate with friends and family, despite the grief caused by a pandemic now stretching into its second year. Saying she understood the difficulty of spending the holiday season “with one familiar laugh missing,” the monarch delivered her address beside a framed photograph of her arm-in-arm with Prince Philip, who died in April at age 99. On her right shoulder was the same sapphire chrysanthemum brooch she wore in the photo — a glittering statement pin that she also wore as a newlywed. “Although it’s a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones,’’ the queen said in the prerecorded message broadcast when many British families were enjoying their traditional Christmas dinner. “This year, especially, I understand why.’’ This festive season is the first since the monarch said goodbye to her husband of more than 70 years in a service in St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. Coronavirus restrictions in place at the time meant that the queen sat alone — a poignant reminder of how she would spend her life going forward. Despite her own loss, the queen said her family was a “source of great happiness, noting that she had welcomed four great-grandchildren this year. “While COVID again means we can’t celebrate quite as we may have wished, we can still enjoy the many happy traditions, be it the singing of carols — as long as the tune is well known — decorating the tree, giving and receiving presents or watching a favorite film where we already know the ending,” she said. “It’s no surprise that families so often treasure their Christmas routines.” As the highly transmissible omicron coronavirus variant spreads rapidly across there U.K., the 95-year-old queen has decided not to spend Christmas at Sandringham, the royal estate in eastern England where she traditionally spends the festive season with family. The palace said Monday that the queen would spend the holidays at Windsor Castle, west of London, where she has remained throughout most of the pandemic. She will be joined by some members of her family, including Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall. The annual Christmas message to the people of the U.K. and the Commonwealth marks the end of a busy and sometimes difficult year for the queen. Philip died in April, just two months shy of his 100th birthday, after spending weeks in the hospital. Buckingham Palace announced this week that she had agreed to stage a service of thanksgiving for his life in the spring. The monarch has had health issues of her own, cutting down on travel and work since spending a night in the hospital in October and being told to rest by her doctors. Since then, she has undertaken light duties including virtual audiences with diplomats and weekly conversations with the prime minister. In June, she made an appearance at the Group of Seven summit in Cornwall, and in November she gave a recorded address to the U.N. Climate Talks in Glasgow. In closing her Christmas message, the queen noted that the holiday is often seen as a time for children. But, she said, this is “only half the story.’’ “Perhaps it’s truer to say that Christmas can speak to the child within us all. Adults, when weighed down with worries, sometimes fail to see the joy in simple things where children do not. And for me and my family, even with one familiar laugh missing this year, there will be joy in Christmas.’’",World/Associated Press,Queen recalls 'familiar laugh missing' in Christmas speech,https://news.yahoo.com/queen-recalls-familiar-laugh-missing-151144939.html
