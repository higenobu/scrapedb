3/12/2022,"A senior Ukrainian official said that Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday that he should take Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for ending the war. An official in the Israeli Prime Minster's Office denies the claim. Why it matters: Bennett has emerged as a key mediator between Putin and Zelensky in the last two weeks. Israel has said it needs to remain neutral in the mediation, but the Ukrainian official told Axios that Bennett must present proposals and do more than act as a ""mailbox"" between the two sides.

Driving the news: The senior Ukrainian official claimed Bennett initiated the call on Tuesday and recommended Zelensky take the offer. Zelensky and his advisers didn’t like Bennett’s recommendation, according to the Ukrainian official. ""Bennett is basically telling us to surrender and we have no intention of doing that,"" the senior Ukrainian official said. A senior official in the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said that the details of the call as described the Ukrainian official were not true. “We doubt that the official is a senior person that is in Ukraine now and who was on the call, because it was conducted on a private line. Our contacts are directly with President Zelensky and his close advisers,"" the official in the Prime Minister’s Office said. The Israeli official said Bennett didn’t recommend that Zelensky take Putin’s offer because Israel hasn’t received such an offer. “The prime minister doesn’t intend to give Zelensky any recommendations or advice at any stage,"" the official said. The Israeli official stressed the call between Zelensky and Bennett was good and long and included a discussion about the possibility of holding a mediation meeting in Jerusalem. The Israeli official declined to comment on whether Israel is going to propose a more detailed plan for ending the war. “The prime minister’s efforts are focused on one thing — stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine,"" the official said. Behind the scenes: In the last two weeks — and especially after Bennett’s trip to Moscow last Saturday — the Israeli government has claimed that it needs to maintain a careful and balanced approach to the war in Ukraine. The Israelis asked Ukraine in private to stop requesting military assistance or political backing from Israel because it will harm the mediation efforts that demand neutrality, the senior Ukrainian official said. Details: The senior Ukrainian official said Zelensky and his aides didn’t get the impression over the last week that Bennett’s mediation efforts are bearing any fruit. The government in Kyiv thinks Bennett has not been acting as a mediator, the senior Ukrainian official said. He added that a mediator needs to push for compromises, put proposals on the table and not simply pass messages. “We don’t need another mailbox, we have enough of those,"" the Ukrainian official said. The official added that Zelensky and his advisers believe that if Bennett wants to stay neutral and mediate, he needs to appoint an envoy that will work on this full time. Between the lines: The Ukrainian president and his aides think that Bennett’s diplomatic involvement is largely motivated by his goal of not taking a clear position on the Russian invasion in order to maintain good relations with Russia, according to the Ukrainian official. “His initiative looks like an excuse for why he is not speaking out against Russia, not providing weapons to Ukraine and not sanctioning Russia,"" the Ukrainian official said. The official noted that France and Germany are also passing messages between Kyiv and Moscow and don’t claim they have to stay neutral. Like this article?

3/12/2022,"Corrections and clarifications: This story has been updated to correct the photo credit. The Joro spider, a colorful arachnid that can grow as big as the palm of your hand, has rapidly spread across the southeast and could be invading the east coast very soon. Experts don't yet know if or when the spider will come to Indiana. But because the Joro spider's fangs can't bite people or poison pets or large animals, it won't be a huge concern. Timothy Gibb, an entomologist at Purdue University, said the Joro spider's presence won't be ""terribly remarkable,"" but there's another creepy crawly that gives him pause: the Asian needle ant, which was recently discovered in Southern Indiana. From USA Today: A spider as big as the palm of your hand could soon invade the East Coast, scientists say While the ant has traveled southern states like Florida and Georgia for several years, it was discovered just last week in the Evansville area — the furthest north the Asian needle ant has ventured, Gibb said. It's the first ant in Indiana that has a stinger and venom sac, Gibb said. For many years, experts have assured Hoosiers there aren't any ants with stingers in the area, but that's not the case anymore. ""Other ants will bite,"" he said, ""but this is really new."" The Asian needle ant, Brachyponera chinensis, is very similar in appearance to another invasive species of ant in Indiana, the Argentine ant. But don't let it fool you. In addition to their stingers, the needle ant can infest homes as well as woodland and outdoor areas, putting them ""in close proximity with people,"" Gibb said. This poses a difference from fire ants, which prefer to reside outside, and increases the ant's ability to survive in cold temperatures. ""Because it does get inside homes, it's somewhat protected from the temperature extremes that ... sometimes limit it,"" Gibb said, ""and it also increases the probability of it moving with people, hitchhiking."" More: Here are 5 of the most harmful invasive animals and insects wreaking havoc in Indiana To most, stings from the Asian needle ant will not be harmful, just painful. However, people who are hyper-allergic to stings from insects like bees or wasps should be prepared with treatment such as an EpiPen. Gibb said that while he hopes people aren't in a state of panic, they should be aware of the dangers that this ant can pose. ""It can be lethal,"" Gibb said.

3/12/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday urged the people of his nation to be patient as they continue to defend their country against Russia's military invasion, which has now entered its 16th day. ""I know that many people have started to feel tired. I understand. Impatient. I understand,"" Zelensky said in a video posted online. ""This is life. When we mobilize, when we see our victories and the loss of the enemy on the battlefield, we expect the struggle to end sooner. We expect the invaders to fall faster. But this is life, this is war. This is a struggle. Time is still needed. Patience is still needed."" A defiant Zelensky insisted Ukraine will prevail despite reports of Russian forces striking near airports in the western part of Ukraine for the first time while its troops were attempting to encircle the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. ""It is impossible to say for how many more days we must liberate our Ukrainian land. But it is possible to say we will do it,"" Zelensky said, according to an English translation of his remarks by Ukraine's U.N. mission. ""Because we have already reached a strategic turning point. We are already moving toward our goal, toward our victory."" ""This is a patriotic war against an obstinate enemy which doesn't pay attention to thousands of their own soldiers dead,"" he added. Zelensky's comments came as Russian forces continued their siege on Mariupol, where civilians have now been without water, electricity and heat for more than a week. ""This is a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Zelensky said. ""Humanitarian catastrophe — two words that have become fully synonymous with the other two words: the Russian Federation."" On Wednesday, Ukrainian officials said a Russian airstrike had destroyed a children's hospital and maternity ward in the city. The attack was widely condemned by world leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris, who said the U.S. would work with its allies to investigate Russia for possible war crimes. President Biden spoke with Zelensky on Friday morning before announcing new U.S. sanctions against Russia, including a ban imports of Russian alcohol, seafood and diamonds. Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said on Friday that Russian forces invading Ukraine have killed more Ukrainian civilians than soldiers. At least 549 Ukrainian civilians, including 41 children, have been killed, according to the United Nations. But the agency believes the actual death toll is likely much higher. According to the U.N., more than 2.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Feb. 24, when Russia's invasion began. Zelensky implored those who have stayed to ""hold on."" ""Be sure to fight. Be sure to give your all strength,"" he said. ""It will not be easy with such a neighbor. But with us, it will not be easy too.""",World/Yahoo News,Zelensky says Ukraine has 'reached a strategic turning point' in its fight against Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/zelensky-strategic-turning-point-russia-war-ukraine-video-155536756.html
