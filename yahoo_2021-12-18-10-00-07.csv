12/18/2021,"Lawrence Taylor, the Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker who spent his entire career with the New York Giants, has reportedly been arrested in Broward County, Florida on two felony counts related to his status as a registered sex offender.  According to Andy Slater of Fox Sports 640 in South Florida, Taylor, 62, was arrested for failing to update his home address with the authorities, something sex offenders are required to do.  Taylor pleaded guilty to one count of sexual misconduct and one count of soliciting a prostitute in the third degree in 2011. The charges came after a 16-year-old girl said she'd been beaten by a pimp and forced to have sex with Taylor in his Rockland County, New York hotel room. Taylor said that he thought the girl was 19 at the time.  At the sentencing in April 2011, Taylor was given Level 1 sex offender status, which is the lowest of the three levels of sex offenders. He was considered low risk and his photo did not appear in an online sex offender database. He was also sentenced to six years of probation in his home state of Florida.  Taylor was arrested on Thursday night and released several hours later, according to TMZ. ",U.S./Yahoo Sports,Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor reportedly arrested for sex offender reporting violation,https://news.yahoo.com/nfl-hall-of-famer-lawrence-taylor-reportedly-arrested-for-sex-offender-reporting-violation-231937664.html
12/18/2021,"As the Omicron variant rips through the country and New York City experiences a record surge in COVID-19 cases headed into the holidays, public health officials have one big message for all Americans over 16 years old: Get your booster right now. But Fox News viewers got a very different message when they tuned in to The Five on Friday afternoon. According to the channel’s self-described comedy host, you’re better off with “nature’s vaccination.” “If you urge a booster for Omicron, does that mean you are actually going to end up preventing a more effective kind of vaccination, ‘nature’s vaccination,’ which would raise the natural immunity,” Gutfeld said, adding that this would be “in a safe way” despite the clear increased risk for people who contract the virus without a booster. Actual Comedians Roast Greg Gutfeld’s New Fox News ‘Comedy’ Show Studies have already found that a third dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines significantly reduces the chance of symptomatic infection from Omicron. Suggesting without evidence that the boosters “may not be that effective,” Gutfeld asked, “Why would you get a booster against what is, effectively, could be a booster,” referring to Omicron itself. “Call me a quack, I don’t care,” he added with a shrug before turning the entire thing into an attack on President Joe Biden. “That’s what makes Joe Biden kind of a despicable non-leader,” he said. “He hears of Omicron, high-transmission, low severity, and instead of trying to help America regain its sense of normalcy, he redefines it as a ‘winter of death.’” As of Friday, with the Christmas holiday still a week away, cases were up 31 percent nationwide and deaths were up 23 percent, averaging over 1,200 per day and adding to the more than 800,000 Americans who have died from the virus since it first emerged.
