3/12/2022,"It is always a good idea to warm up before serious exercise and the 22-runner Imperial Cup at Sandown Park on Saturday is an ideal way to stretch the betting tendons and sinews ahead of the Cheltenham Festival next week. Balco Coastal, runner-up in a Grade Two novice event last time out, has emerged as favourite and has obvious scope for improvement after just three starts over timber. Nicky Henderson’s form is a slight concern though, as his yard has not sent out a winner since mid-February, and an opening mark of 134 looks no more than fair. Dan Skelton and Paul Nicholls, successful in the last two renewals, also have fancied runners but the market’s focus on big-name yards allows others with decent chances to creep in at generous odds. Lively Citizen (2.25), the star of David Jeffreys’ small yard near Evesham, is a prime example. He is two-from-three since 7lb claimer Archie Bellamy took over in the saddle, and the race in between was a non-event as his saddle slipped early on. He is just 4lb higher after another battling success at Leicester in February and with many firms offering six places, he looks an excellent each-way bet at around 20-1. Wolverhampton 1.31 It all went wrong from an early stage for Asadjumeirah at Lingfield last time but his previous winning form at Newcastle looks strong and at around 7-1, he deserves another chance. Sandown Park 1.50 Knappers Hill was doing all his best work in the closing stages of the Betfair Hurdle last time and this step up in trip looks sure to suit. Wolverhampton 2.05 There is little to choose between La Tihaty and Hafeet Alain on their best form so at the likely odds, Ed Walker’s six-year-old has to be the pick at around 5-1. Wolverhampton 2.40 Several of these have run well in Group races on turf, including Happy Power, less than four lengths behind the winner in the Group One sprint on Champions day last October. French-trained Amilcar, though, has plenty of form on all-weather surfaces too, including a Listed win at Deauville in December, and even with a 3lb penalty, looks overpriced at around 12-1 to follow up here. Sandown Park 3.00 Mullenbeg has won with plenty in hand on both her starts to date and should justify the decision to run here in preference to the Champion Bumper at Cheltenham next week. Sandown Park 3.35 Scene Not Herd has made an excellent start to his chasing career and remains unbeaten over fences after three starts in handicaps. He has been given a break since ending Minella Trump’s six-race winning streak in December and makes plenty of appeal at around 3-1.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Lively Citizen can lift the Imperial Cup at generous odds,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/11/talking-horses-lively-citizen-can-lift-the-imperial-cup-at-generous-odds-horse-racing-tips
3/12/2022,"Talks on the revival of the Iran nuclear deal have become a casualty of the war in Ukraine after an indefinite pause was announced over last-minute Russian demands. An agreement on the nuclear deal to bring the US and Iran back into compliance would have led to a swathe of US sanctions on Iran being lifted, including Iranian crude oil exports and petrochemicals, in return for limits on its nuclear activity. In the past week, however, Moscow has insisted Washington pledge not to sanction any trade between Russia and Iran once an agreement is signed. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has called for guarantees that if the nuclear deal is restored, western sanctions on Russia over Ukraine will “not in any way damage our right to free and full trade, economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation” with Iran. Moscow, keen to keep oil prices high and maintain Europe’s dependency on Russian energy, is also not eager to see additional oil supplies flood the market. Iran exported nearly 2m barrels a day in 2016, the year after the original deal was made, and in practice has been exporting illicitly to China for months. US oil sanctions were reimposed on Iran in 2018 when Donald Trump pulled out of the deal. The EU foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, tweeted on Friday: “A pause in the Vienna talks is needed due to external factors. A final text is essentially ready and on the table.” The Russian chief negotiator, Mikhail Ulyanov, denied it had only been Russian objections that led to the near-complete text not being signed off, and tried to suggest other countries still had problems with it. He told reporters he didn’t know how long the break in talks would be and that he didn’t believe there was “any impasse.” “The only thing which I want to tell you ... [is that] the conclusion of the deal does not depend on Russia only,” he said. Russia has been a key broker of the painstaking talks in Vienna, which have lasted for almost a year, and if the impasse is prolonged there is likely to be a debate over whether Moscow can absolutely use its UN veto on the agreement known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Washington underlined that it had no intention of accommodating Russia’s demands for an exemption, which it has said have nothing to do with the Iran talks. A small number of outstanding and difficult issues were still yet to be resolved for a deal to be reached, it said. Iran’s official spokesman did criticise the Russian intervention, but the unexpected impasse opens up the prospect that no agreement will be reached until the Ukraine war is resolved. The west had said it is imperative an deal is reached quickly because the value of reviving it would be badly eroded if it is delayed and Iran continues to gain nuclear expertise. Henry Rome, an Iran expert at Eurasia Group, said Russia’s support may not be indispensable for a deal, depending on how Russia prosecute its demands. “Russia’s most important role in JCPOA implementation would be as the importer of Iran’s excess enriched uranium stockpile, which would be transported to Russia via ship and exchanged for natural uranium,” he said. “It is possible another importer could be found, however, such as the low-enriched uranium fuel bank in Kazakhstan. “Russia’s other roles are notable but are not prerequisites to implementing the agreement, including providing fuel to the Bushehr power reactor and the Tehran research reactor and assisting Iran in converting the Fordow site for stable isotope production.”",News/World news,Iran nuclear talks on hold over last-minute Russian demands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/iran-nuclear-talks-on-hold-over-last-minute-russian-demands
3/12/2022,"Was getting into bed with the gambling industry just part of a plan by NFL owners to recoup millions in talent wages? Asking for Calvin Ridley, who’s having an especially rough week. On Monday the league sidelined the star Atlanta Falcons receiver for the 2022 season after an internal investigation revealed Ridley had bet on games during a five-day stretch late last November. In the wake of the news Ridley admitted to betting $1,500. He was slated to make $11m this fall. If this isn’t the worst loss in gambling, it’s a sure sign of impaired judgement. Never mind that Ridley says he doesn’t have a gambling problem. “Yes you clearly do!” Bomani Jones roars. “Whether you have an addiction, that’s a different discussion. But a problem? The problem is why we’re all here.” You’d be hard pressed to name a pundit who’s better suited to tackle this story than Jones. Besides being a sports savant and a sharp cultural critique, the 41-year-old pundit is also thoroughly engaging. Now in addition to his protracted run at ESPN – where he stands out for his longform, nuanced takes on television, radio and as a podcast host – Jones will be moonlighting on HBO as host of a new late night show called Game Theory, which debuts on Sunday. The plan is to export the casual infotainment vibe of his hit podcast, The Right Time, to premium cable –where the Emmy winner joins a heavyweight card that includes much-admired sportscaster Bob Costas and the no-bullshit interviewer Bryant Gumbel. Talk about a gamble. The notion of a sports-themed TV satire modeled after The Daily Show has been tried time and again. The late Norm Macdonald saw his half-hour Comedy Central series, Sports Show, cancelled after nine episodes in 2011. In 2017 ESPN invested heavily in relaunching its 6pm SportsCenter block around smart aleck-y scribes Jemele Hill and Michael Smith, only for network executives to abandon that effort after a steep ratings decline that started with Hill picking a Twitter fight with Donald Trump. Even Snoop Dogg and Kevin Hart gave the format a go during the Tokyo Olympics for Peacock before only to eventually drop sports from their Ridiculousness-style highlight show completely. Decades on from Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann’s arch run anchoring ESPN’s ‘Big Show’, it’s clear that parodying sports is a lot harder than it looks. “Sports fans take this stuff really seriously,” Jones says. “You’re not just gonna get in here cracking jokes. They need it to come from somebody they take seriously.” Few ESPN personalities come off more sensibly than Jones, the Atlanta-born, Houston-raised son of university professors who boasts a master’s in economics and, for a time, pursued a doctorate. Meanwhile, he got his big break at ESPN.com as a columnist for Page 2 – the culture-oriented vertical that featured narrative nonfiction masters David Halberstam and Ralph Wiley and also launched the career of Bill Simmons. (“My dream job at that point,” Jones says.) When ESPN let him walk in 2007, Jones gigged around the sports talk radio scene in North Carolina’s Research Triangle before launching his own show, The Morning Jones. That started him rotating through ESPN’s afternoon block of opinion-based week-daily news programs, which likewise attempt the tightrope walk between serious and silly. After stints as a panelist on Around the Horn and a co-starring role with the Miami Herald sports columnist-cum-radio host Dan Le Batard and his father on Highly Questionable, Jones was tapped to co-lead an experimental chat show called High Noon that struggled to distinguish itself after two years on air. That forced Jones back to his radio roots, but as host of The Right Time, a three-times weekly engagement that finds Jones riffing on the big headlines, making broader connections to cultural issues and cracking wise on everything in between – a knack that especially endeared him to ex-ESPN boss John Skipper. “He believed that I had quite the gift for being provocative without getting in trouble,” Jones recalls. Meanwhile, his recent HBO contributions alongside Costas on Back on the Record primed the pump for Game Theory, which gets a six-week trial. Armed with a crack team of producers (the omnipotent Adam McKay) and writers (veteran ESPN sage Howard Bryant), the show hopes to offer a window into Jones’s particular way of looking at and thinking about sports. Jones better than anyone understands the difficulty in that task and is giving the show the grace to take shape naturally. “Some things are good in the room, but not great in application,” he says. “And when you see that it’s not great in application, you go to something else. The pressure is not about the preciousness of that idea. The pressure comes if you don’t think you have another one.” Reassuringly, that’s not a problem here. When it comes to Jones, smart ideas are always in supply. And between HBO’s estimable sports bonafides and Jones’s unimpeachable status as the thinking fan’s sports pundit, well, you’d have to be a Ridley-grade fool not give Game Theory a sporting chance.",Sport/Sport,Bomani Jones: the cerebral sports pundit leaves things late on HBO,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/bomani-jones-game-theory-hbo-sports-pundit
3/12/2022,"Sunday night’s Baftas ceremony is set to stage a confident return to pre-pandemic levels of glitz and glamour amid fears of flagging audience engagement. The longest red carpet in Europe will wrap itself around a full-capacity Albert Hall ahead of the events, which boasts a new host in Australian comedy actor Rebel Wilson and, for only the second time in two decades, a pre-watershed broadcast on BBC One. Last year’s ceremony also took place at the Albert Hall but with minimal hooplah, virtual acceptance speeches and no live audience. Although the awards verdicts were lauded, Bafta’s renewed credibility was dinted three weeks later by revelations in the Guardian of multiple allegations of verbal abuse, bullying and sexual misconduct against the film-maker Noel Clarke, who had received the outstanding contribution to British cinema prize. Bafta had known about the allegations beforehand yet continued with the presentation. Both the outstanding contribution prize and the annual Bafta fellowship have been paused for 2022 as new vetting processes are introduced. Instead, Bafta appears to be moving in a new direction by targeting a family audience for its film awards, which traditionally has lower viewing figures than the equivalent TV-awards ceremony, which is held before the watershed. Another indication that producers are targeting a Strictly crowd is that the traditional Cirque du Soleil opener has been replaced by Shirley Bassey singing a James Bond theme, to mark 60 years of the franchise. The 20th anniversary of the Harry Potter franchise is also likely to be celebrated. Presenters include a number of names – such as RuPaul and Bridgerton’s Regé-Jean Page – far more familiar to a small-screen audience than to cinemagoers. They will be joined by stars such as Emma Watson and Tom Hiddleston, whose big-screen work this year has been minimal but whose appearances in blockbusters may help draw a younger audience. Lady Gaga, nominated this year for her role in House of Gucci, will present the rising star award, which is decided by public vote. One key absentee is Prince William, who is instead recording a video message. The no-show by Bafta’s president and his wife, Kate Middleton, represents a considerable blow to the event’s international profile. On Thursday, Bafta said the absence was down to “diary constraints” but it has been speculated that the Duke is displeased with the BBC’s recent coverage of the royal family. Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace all condemned Amol Rajan’s The Princes and the Press series, which included claims that courtiers leaked negative stories about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Suggestions that the Duke of Cambridge’s no-show was a recent development were further fuelled by an appearance by Rebel Wilson earlier this week in which she said that she was running potential jokes by a key member of the royals. Wilson was a hit at the 2020 awards, when she used her presenter spot to poke fun at the all-maleness of the best director shortlist, as well as Tom Hooper’s much-ridiculed film Cats, in which she starred. Her hiring is seen as a bold statement by Bafta, following a badly received two-year stint by Joanna Lumley that came after years in which the ceremony was emceed by either Stephen Fry or Graham Norton. Wilson, 42, has also suggested she will try and include the “filthiest, cheekiest jokes” possible, “because you’ve got to push the limits”. How this will work given the show’s new primetime slot remains to be seen; the biggest laugh she received in 2020 was for a comparison of the “gifting wallet” received by all attendees with her own vagina. Bafta’s fresh direction is in contrast to the continued uncertainty surrounding the Oscars, which take place a fortnight later. The 94th Academy Awards will return to the Dolby cinema after a socially distanced ceremony in Los Angeles’ Union Station last year, for which viewing figures dropped by more than 50%. Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes have signed on to oversee proceedings, after three years without a host. The Academy’s decision not to present eight craft awards – including best editing and best score – as part of the main telecast has been criticised by numerous film-makers. There has also been some confusion over Covid protocols, with differing requirements for attendees, presenters and performers, presumably to accommodate those stars who are rumoured to be anti-vaxxers. While people in the stalls will need proof of jabs, those on stage are required only to provide a recent negative test. Bafta’s rules are more relaxed but apply to everyone, regardless of status: a negative PCR or lateral flow test within the past 24 hours.",Arts/Film,"Glitz, glamour, Gaga … but no royals: can a real-life return save the Baftas?",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/11/gaga-but-no-royals-can-a-real-life-return-save-the-baftas

3/12/2022,"Last month, anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe sparked change by highlighting huge price increases on food that far exceeded the Office for National Statistics’ inflation figure of 5.4%; the cost of living crisis, it seems, is hitting low-income Britons the hardest. The ONS responded by saying it accepted that everyone has their own “personal inflation” rate. But what affects our rate, and why does it matter? I asked Edward Smith, co-chief investment officer at Rathbones, a wealth management firm which offers a free-to-use personal inflation calculator. I’d never heard of a personal inflation rate before. Why are we talking about it now?For the last 25 years, inflation has been stable. But now we’re back to a rate we haven’t seen since the 90s. It’s probably going to get up to 7.5%, possibly 8%, come April. Oof! All this because of energy prices?Not entirely. Energy prices accounted for about six-tenths of the overall increase last year, but there’s also Covid. We’re spending more on goods than services, and that demand butted up against supply-chain disruptions. The good news is we think spending habits are likely to normalise, and we expect it to be back at 2% by next year. Hmm, I’m not sure. It sounds like inflation spikes when disaster strikes, and with the climate crisis there are plenty of those coming.Yes. Some of the areas most affected by climate disasters are in our supply chains, such as Asia. Though there are some people who say the rising energy costs are due to Europe going down the green route too quickly and failing to consider the impact of a relatively windless summer, like last year’s. So how long have the ONS averages on inflation been problematic?I wouldn’t say they have been. The ONS has always been clear that the number it produces is an average for the whole country, and over the past 20 years the rates haven’t been all that different between groups. We’re talking about a few tenths of a per cent between lower earners – who tend to be younger, without property wealth – versus higher earners. One of the reasons we have the personal inflation calculator is because you may have a few years when you’re spending more on something: medical care for a loved one, say. And inflation is an important part of planning. Say you save £100 a month for 20 years; if the rate of inflation was 2%, then your £24k savings would be worth about £16k in inflation-adjusted terms. But if 2% wasn’t representative for you and your rate was more like 3%, then your savings would be worth only about £13k. That’s massive. The ONS says it’s working on capturing the rates across different groups – how?By using a big-data approach, where it takes all the transaction data from supermarkets instead of using a sample of prices through surveys. That sounds like a data-protection nightmare.It’s all anonymised! Hope so – I prefer to keep my prosecco-purchasing habits out of any official roster. We talked about 2% being a “good” amount of inflation; why not 0%?Because if inflation is too low, people may be put off spending, thinking prices are going to get even lower. That means companies making fewer sales, and job losses. Ultimately, the cost to society of 1-2% of deflation is much greater than the cost of 1-2% inflation. Though I’d like the price of my prosecco to stay the same.",Lifestyle/Life and style,What’s my personal inflation rate?

3/12/2022,"New technology that allows for daily medications to instead be taken just once a week or month could transform the lives of people with conditions ranging from schizophrenia to opioid addiction, researchers have said. The method was initially developed for a new type of contraceptive pill – a capsule, initially tested in pigs, that dissolves in the stomach to release a six-armed structure that delivers synthetic hormones over three weeks before falling apart and exiting the body. Lyndra, the company that is developing the technology – backed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – plans to start phase 1 trials in humans towards the end of this year. And the technology is also being applied to a host of other medications, including ivermectin for eradicating malaria. A once-a-week pill containing risperidone, an antipsychotic used for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is to go into clinical trials this year, the company said, and is expected to be submitted for approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of next year, with approval hoped for by the end of 2024. Trish Hurter, the chief executive of Lyndra, said reducing the frequency for certain pills could bring health and economic benefits. “In schizophrenia specifically, adherence is a huge driver of outcomes,” she said. “When people aren’t maintained on stable therapy, that’s when they have relapses and hospitalisations.” Not only does a long-lasting pill reduce the chance of missing a dose, but the technology allows for a steady concentration of a drug to be released over a given period. “When you take daily pills, your drug levels are like a rollercoaster ride,” said Hurter. At the start of the day, levels of the drug in the body can be very high, potentially triggering side-effects, while by the end of the day they may be too low to work. And there are other advantages to the new approach. “If you’re a parent trying to help an adult child who’s just been diagnosed with schizophrenia, they don’t want to be treated like a kid any more and told every day, ‘take your meds’,” Hurter said. “Having that interaction be less frequent just makes the whole thing more respectful, and better for the patient.” The company also plans to initiate a phase 1 trial for a once-a-week pill containing levomethadone, a drug used for opioid use disorder. Hurter said the approach could bring huge benefits as at present people requiring the drug must visit a clinic every day for observed dosing. “It’s really hard for you to actually recover and get your life back on track when you’re visiting a clinic every day,” she said, adding that clinic resources were limited, meaning access could be difficult. “When you think of the daily pill, it’s highly effective provided you take it as prescribed, but hardly anybody does,” said Hurter. Lyndra is also developing the approach for rosuvastatin, a type of drug used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as a drug to control diabetes. But Hurter said the technology may not work for all medications. For the approach to work, a week- or month-long dose needs to be able to fit into the capsule – which is not possible for a drug such as metformin, used to treat type 2 diabetes. And developing that technology has been far from simple. “Building something that can stay in the stomach and last for a week is challenging from a materials design standpoint, because your stomach does like 500 to 1,000 contractions a day,” Hurter said. Prof Shôn Lewis, a clinical professor in adult psychiatry at the University of Manchester, said it would be important to study whether the approach has the expected impact given the options already available for people with conditions such as schizophrenia, while a key question remained whether Lyndra’s products would be approved in the UK by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. “I think that the definitive trial … is going to be when we do this in real life, with the warts-and-all stuff of people’s everyday lives, and does this really translate into a practical, clinical benefit?” he said. However, Lewis said weekly pills could be particularly useful in the initial treatment of people relapsing in the community, allowing health professionals to give a single pill rather than having to arrange daily visits to give risperidone. “That could be a crucial step forward,” he said. Prof Cynthia Graham, an expert in sexual and reproductive health at the University of Southampton, welcomed the approach, saying while long-acting contraceptives such as hormonal implantsand intrauterine systems were very effective, not all women liked them. “Missing pills is a massive issue still. And just the idea of taking it every day …” A once-a-month pill could be a positive step, she said. “I think it would be a big addition, I really do.”",News/Science,Hopes raised for once-a-week pills for range of conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/11/hopes-raised-for-once-a-week-pills-for-range-of-conditions
3/12/2022,"A ruling that the Metropolitan police’s handling of a proposed vigil for Sarah Everard was not in accordance with the law comes after a torrid period for the force. Dame Cressida Dick was last month forced out of her role as the Met commissioner after the London mayor accused her of failing to deal with a culture of misogyny and racism within Britain’s biggest force. Sadiq Khan’s confidence in her reached breaking point when a scandal emerged at Charing Cross police station, where officers shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages. Two of the officers investigated were promoted, while nine were left to continue serving. The Met leadership’s handling of the murder of Everard in March 2021 by a serving Met officer also caused consternation in City Hall and government. After her killer was sentenced to a whole-life term in September 2021, the Met leadership was expected to show it understood those concerns. Instead, it was mocked after saying that women who were worried about an officer approaching them could wave down a bus. Judges have now ruled that the Met breached the rights of the organisers of a vigil for Everard with its handling of the planned event. The leaders of the campaign group Reclaim These Streets withdrew from organising the vigil after being told by the force they would face fines of £10,000 each and possible prosecution if the event went ahead. But in its place, a spontaneous vigil and protest took place that culminated in scenes of women being dragged off by male police officers that caused outrage across the political spectrum. The ruling is an embarrassment for the government, particularly the home secretary, Priti Patel, who had made it clear to police that a ban on gatherings had to be enforced. After the ruling, one of the founders of Reclaim These Streets, Jamie Klingler, said that had the Met cooperated with the group, an organised vigil would have involved dozens of stewards who could communicate with the police. “It would have been a quiet moment of silence and then we would have gone home,” she said. Klingler said the Met’s approach “lit a match”. She has also warned the Met that any attempt to appeal against the decision would “further erode women’s trust in the force”. But Scotland Yard has said it is considering an appeal, arguing that the judgment has “potential implications in other circumstances for how a proportionality assessment is to be carried out when considering enforcement action”. The force said these implications may apply beyond policing the pandemic. Even in the context of regulations that kept people safe during the pandemic, this may have important consequences. In a statement released after the ruling, the Met quoted the high court judges, adding that it was incumbent on the force to “ensure that this judgment does not unduly inhibit its ability, and that of police forces across the country, to effectively balance competing rights in a way that is operationally deliverable”. But with such pressure on the force to move on from the terrible damage to its reputation in recent months, it will be paying close attention to the warning issued by Reclaim These Streets that to appeal would be to damage relations with women further.",News/UK news,How damaging is the Met’s high court loss over the Sarah Everard vigil?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/sarah-everard-vigil-metropolitan-police-reclaim-these-streets-ruling
3/12/2022,"Do you remember Roman Abramovich’s much-vaunted role as peacebroker between Ukraine and Russia? A full 11 days ago in Russia’s repulsive war of choice on Ukraine, the erstwhile Chelsea owner was reported to be engineering some kind of impeccably connected end to hostilities. Can I shock you? This has turned out to be cobblers. And yet, it was dutifully parroted to the world’s media by Chelsea Football Club’s spokesperson, Rola Brentlin. “I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution,” she announced, “and that he has been trying to help ever since.” Well done, Rola! This story made headlines around the globe for precisely one calendar day, and we haven’t heard a single word of it since. Unfathomably, Abramovich has been seen nowhere near the negotiating table, and it seems more likely that far from being engaged in “trying to help ever since”, the oligarch has spent most waking hours trying to shift his various UK assets before those nice pre-warners of the British government finally got around to freezing them on Thursday. The government claims his more measurable part in the war effort is owning 29% of a firm that may have supplied steel for Russian tanks. The firm denies it. Claims of Roman’s pivotal strategic role in potentially ending the war felt so fantastical that they might as well have cast him as some peacemaking chameleon, a very Zelig of international diplomacy. He was there at Westphalia in 1648, where he played some of his best treatying, and at Versailles in 1919, where he had an absolute shitter. And yet, many accepted and repeated the claims – performing ever more unpaid service in the reputation laundromat. Abramovich had bought himself yet another day of grace to add to the thousands and thousands of days of grace he has enjoyed in the UK since buying Chelsea in 2003. The fact is, a lot of people have always just preferred thinking the best of the oligarch. He was never hated by supporters at Stamford Bridge, for instance, and Chelsea’s travelling fans were even chanting his name within a minute of kick-off on Thursday night at Norwich. Not for their departing owner the indignities suffered by, say, former QPR owner Flavio Briatore, who was once caught on camera fuming: “Give me the names of the ones booing me or I sell the club!” No point looking for the grownups in the room because there weren’t any. You always had a strong sense that the authorities in and around English football would have been extremely relaxed if Chelsea had started enriching uranium, or acquired medium-range ballistic missiles. Ooh, he’s put far more in to football than he’s taken out, you know? As for Roman himself, that blank, mildly hangdog face was so often described as inscrutable, but it was actually very scrutable. It was perfectly obvious to anyone who spent more than a minute considering it that he continued to enjoy a super relationship with Vladimir Putin. Football was the lesser but still significant part of it. Aside from assisting Putin in successfully bidding for the sportswashing 2018 World Cup, Abramovich was also required by the Russian president to pay for some of it “in partnership with the state”. For a long time he effectively bankrolled the then Russia manager Guus Hiddink’s £6.25m salary. Sport was so slow to catch itself on to reality that it would be hilarious, if the circumstances were any less horrific. Tomorrow Chelsea will host Newcastle, who are now owned by a group led by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia – but remember, those guys are the good autocrats, because they buy our weapons. And use them in a war in Yemen that has thus far gone on for seven years, killing or starving hundreds of thousands, the vast majority believed to be children under five. But of course, the sovereign wealth fund isn’t the same as the Riyadh government. They just have a good relationship with it, same as Roman Abramovich just has a good relationship with Putin. “Which owner knows the guy who’s killed more babies?” is a question you won’t be seeing on any banners at Chelsea-Newcastle. Still, you have to say that Abramovich had a very good run. In this country there are murderers demonised less than guys who only become football fans later in life; the otherwise grotesque faux pas of being a footballing Johnny-come-lately was tolerated in Abramovich because he was stinking rich, which the English love. And that love goes far beyond football. The English Premier League may have allowed itself to become disgusting in so many ways, but blaming all the ills on football really won’t do. Football doesn’t make society, it reflects it. The game is really just a small part of a much bigger British industry of servicing, laundering and enabling dirty money that is so large these days as to appear almost respectable. So let’s have no talk of people finally “waking up”, because people knew about Abramovich’s connections all along and preferred not to see, just as they are continuing to do with less newsworthy individuals. Pretending to be morally shocked by something you turned a blind eye to for years – that’s another thing the English are very, very good at. We must be the world’s leading importer of smelling salts. Which mild-mannered international businessman controls those mines? Because he’s had another good week.

3/12/2022,"It may seem an unlikely electoral secret weapon, but as the Liberal Democrats gather for their spring conference this weekend, polls and canvassing have highlighted an issue the party hopes can help secure soft Tory votes: sewage in rivers. Described by one official as the rural equivalent of air quality in cities, the problem of privatised water companies discharging raw sewage has, Lib Dems say, become electorally toxic for the government, and could push more Conservative-held seats the party’s way. The conference, which will be online apart from a speech by the leader, Ed Davey, is the party’s first gathering since its stunning win in December’s North Shropshire byelection, a result that the Lib Dems say means they can target Tory constituencies beyond “blue wall” commuter belt areas. Davey, who will speak in York on Sunday, will push hard on cost-of-living issues, and will also present a plan to use revenue from an increased digital services tax on tech firms to pay for a dedicated counsellor in every primary and secondary school. But Lib Dem officials say one issue that is repeatedly being raised during canvassing for local elections in May is that of sewage, particularly after the government rejected an amendment to the environment bill last year intended to greatly curb discharges into rivers and streams. Many Conservative MP faced a backlash after voting against the amendment. The government replaced it with a measure that, campaigners said, was notably less stringent for water companies. Recent polling for the Lib Dems showed that 36% of UK voters said they would be less likely to vote for an MP who did not support a ban on raw sewage dumped in rivers, rising to 41% of those who voted Conservative in 2019. One of the Lib Dems leading on the campaign is Pippa Heylings, who runs an environmental advisory business and is the party’s candidate for South Cambridgeshire, where the Tory MP, Anthony Browne, has a majority of less than 3,000. “The number of people who have written to me, or who raise it on the doorstep – this touches a nerve across all people, and all parties,” said Heylings, who is a district councillor and has been canvassing for the elections in May. “There is this deeply held sense that this should be clean water. It was building up before we started campaigning on it. But it really came to the surface when the environment bill was going through, with the amendment to stop raw sewage going into rivers. People wrote to me saying they were disgusted that Conservative MPs hadn’t made the commitment for it to stop.” The Lib Dems wins in North Shropshire and in the Chesham and Amersham byelection, nine months ago, gave rise to the idea of a blue wall of vulnerable Tory seats. Canvassers in both seats reported that traditional Conservative voters felt neglected, and said they disliked Boris Johnson. Heylings said this was also the case over sewage discharges, and that many longtime Tory voters were still aghast at the police investigation into alleged lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street. “They just think they’ve been taken for granted, in favour of cronyism and big bonuses for water company bosses who are not doing what they should be,” she said. “When we’re on the doorsteps, people are saying: ‘Yes, yes, we’ve got to think about potholes – but what are you going to do to get rid of Boris Johnson?’ These are people who have voted Conservative all their life, but can’t vote for him and his lot. “It’s fascinating people are saying that at a local election. It’s door after door. The blue wall is real.”",News/Environment,Lib Dems pin hopes on sewage in rivers to attract Tory ‘blue wall’ vote,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/lib-dems-pin-hopes-on-sewage-in-rivers-to-attract-tory-blue-wall-vote
3/12/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has urged Liverpool to “write a special story” by becoming champions in a manner that can make them proud when they are old. Liverpool can close the gap to leaders Manchester City to three points with victory at Brighton on Saturday and play their game in hand on the leaders when they visit Arsenal on Wednesday. Klopp’s side were 14 points behind City in January but have won their past seven league games. They have a habit of finishing seasons strongly under the German and he is eyeing another improbable chapter in his reign. “We want to write a special story here, not only this year but in general,” he said. “If you want to look back later in life on very successful times, you should give absolutely everything now. We have no time and no points to waste. We have to keep going, that is clear, and if there is any kind of momentum we should keep it and work with it. “We cannot call it a title race because we are still behind but we have to win football matches but everybody is excited about having the opportunity to have a title race. So far the boys did really well and why shouldn’t I think we can’t go on?” Klopp hopes Liverpool can benefit from their experience of high-pressure run-ins. “We don’t feel sorry for ourselves; not at all,” he said. “We are used to it. Last season when we wanted to qualify for the Champions League, we had to win all the games in the last weeks. We found ourselves quite frequently in similar situations. I don’t know why it always happens to us. There was one year where we were champions [with games to spare]. All the others were full throttle to the end.” Liverpool suffered only their third defeat in 53 matches in all competitions against Internazionale on Tuesday, albeit while progressing to the Champions League quarter-finals, and Klopp said: “I give usually after a game a little speech in the dressing room. Most of the time it is quite nice but I realised after the game I am in a better mood than the players. My first thought was we are through against tough opponents and their first thought was we lost.”",Sport/Football,‘Write a special story’: Klopp urges Liverpool to go full throttle for title,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-title-special-story
3/12/2022,"We will probably have to wait until he has left the job to hear exactly what Eddie Jones thinks about how club and country co-exist in England but he gave a clue shortly before he was appointed. “How can you manage your players when they are controlled by other organisations?” the Australian asked in late 2015. “In my opinion, that’s the single greatest task ahead of whoever is going to be appointed as the next England coach.” It is a task Jones initially met with belligerence – as demonstrated with his “Donald Trump of rugby” jibe at the Bath owner Bruce Craig – but one that he has learned to grin and bear, and while the Rugby Football Union rarely behaves like Jones is kept on any sort of leash, it seems obvious he is now under strict instruction when it comes to criticising that particular arrangement. It is up for renewal soon enough, after all. Having said that, the subtext this week of Jones declaring Ireland, where the union enjoys far more autonomy over its players, the most cohesive side in the world was clear. But perhaps his comment that the playing field is levelled at the World Cup is more instructive. Because, at times, Jones gives the impression of someone impatiently counting the days until early next summer and the first day of the 2023 World Cup campaign. There was a telling line, buried deep within an RFU announcement last year that the Premiership would be allowed to halt relegation, which said that, in return, the union would have more preparation time in the build up to the World Cup. Indeed, it is understood the RFU has discussed urging the Premiership to host its 2022-23 final as early as mid-May, and if Jones was not leading those negotiations then rest assured he will have approved. The rub, however, is that Jones has already proven to his employers what he is capable of when allowed to spend time knocking his players into shape. Yes, the 2019 World Cup budget was overspent by nearly £1m, and in the current climate you cannot see that happening again, but he has a body of evidence to demonstrate he can achieve the cohesion he so covets next summer, and for that reason it is hard to see him being sacked even if England lose on Saturday and in Paris next Saturday. You sense Jones knows it, too. The mind goes back to the bowels of Twickenham after one of England’s 2019 warm-up fixtures in which Jones waxed lyrical over the physique of Billy Vunipola, conducting a TV interview on the other side of the room. Go back over the highlights reel of England’s quarter-final win over Australia and Jonny May – who scored two tries that day – looks more like a turbo-charged flanker such is the bulk he had put on. Above all else, with uninterrupted access to his players, Jones was able to get Manu Tuilagi in peak shape for the rigours of an arduous campaign. If conditioning was key for Jones, off the field he achieved cohesion too. Jones discusses the booze-fuelled flare-up between Mike Brown and Ben Te’o at a camp in Treviso in his book and pointedly says that was far from the only conflict within the squad. It is believed there was one particular incident when a player’s comedy routine went down so badly he and a teammate had to be pulled apart, and it has been suggested that at one point the rifts were so deep they seemed irreparable. By the latter stages of the tournament, however, players were lining up to explain how it was the most harmonious environment they had been involved in. At first it came across as empty rhetoric but increasingly it seemed genuine. All of which brings us to Twickenham on Saturday, when the majority of the 82,000 supporters in attendance could not care less about England’s pre-World Cup camps next year. They do not want to hear that the current side is a work in progress, that they are on a journey towards France 2023 and that they are headed in the right direction. They do not want to hear that their side are not favourites or that progress is not always linear, and they cannot countenance England being out of the Six Nations title race before the final weekend again. Rather, they simply want to see England perform as the richest union in the world should and to hell with tomorrow. Twickenham is, after all, expensive – it is understood that next season more than two-thirds of tickets are set to cost more than £100 – so supporters expect value for money. But it was telling to this week hear Jones say the difference for England is that they are not immune from criticism even when they win; you almost wonder if that has encouraged his World Cup preoccupation. That is, of course, not to say that Jones is unmoved about Saturday’s outcome and obviously a resounding victory, founded on power and poise, will boost England’s chances both in this Six Nations and at the World Cup. Jones always publicly insists that he is only bothered about the next game – to the extent that the phrase has lost all meaning – and though he will relish adding the final touches next summer, the cohesion he strives for on the field needs to develop over the next 12 months. The average paying punter, though, cares little beyond the next 80 minutes. It should be acknowledged that the groans that greeted performances in late 2020 and early 2021 have largely dissipated. Granted, England have come from a low base – when the ball was described by George Ford as a “ticking timebomb” – but there was a swagger, as well as a good slice of fortune, to last autumn’s win over South Africa and there are some encouraging signs around this team, even if there is a fogginess to it all as well. Jones has complete conviction it will clear by next year and though he has lost two finals, his World Cup record stands scrutiny with the best. Defeat on Saturday, however, and the clouds above Twickenham will darken. Jones, just as 12 months ago, will have another storm to ride.",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones has long-term vision but fans want Six Nations success now | Gerard Meagher ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/eddie-jones-has-long-term-vision-but-fans-want-six-nations-success-now
