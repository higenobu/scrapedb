12/21/2021,"On the 10th anniversary of former supreme leader of North Korea Kim Jong-il's death last week and the beginning of the country's 11-day bereavement mandate, a noticeably slimmer Kim Jong-un made an appearance to commemorate his father's death.

Death anniversary: Donning his trademark black leather coat, North Korean's supreme leader Kim Jong-un, 37, stood in front of thousands of North Koreans who attended the memorial service at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, the mausoleum of the late leader, on Friday, according to Reuters. North Korea's flag was also flown at half-mast as part of the commemoration.
 

 State television footage of the memorial showed Kim looking slimmer than he has in recent years. International media first noticed the change in his physical appearance after he celebrated the 73rd anniversary of North Korea in September, Sky News reported. Rumors and speculation involving his health began circulating after his images were posted online. In late October, South Korea's ​​National Intelligence Service confirmed that Kim lost 44 pounds and that the North Korean government has not been using a body double, ABC News reported. For the 10th anniversary of Kim Jong Il’s death, North Koreans were required to enter an 11-day mourning period and adhere to several bans the government imposed, such as laughing, drinking alcohol and participating in leisure activities, a resident of Sinuiju told Radio Free Asia (RFA). “In the past many people who were caught drinking or being intoxicated during the mourning period were arrested and treated as ideological criminals. They were taken away and never seen again,” the source said, adding that celebrating birthdays and mourning lost loved ones are also not allowed during this period. Local police were also informed to stay vigilant for anyone “who fail[s] to appear appropriately bereaved,” another source said. In addition to the mourning period, elderly military veterans will hold events to raise awareness about Kim Jong-il’s accomplishments. Some of the events include a photography and art exhibition in South Hamgyong and a remembrance concert. 
  Other details: Kim Jong-il succeeded his father, Kim Il-sung, after his death on July 8, 1994. He ruled North Korea until his death on Dec. 17, 2011. The country experienced several challenges under his leadership, including several food shortages, which led to the ""arduous march"" (also known as the “meal-skipping campaign”). On the day of Kim Jong-il’s death, Kim Jong-un, the late ruler’s son who had remained unheard of before the transfer of power, took over the supreme leader position at the age of 27. During his first year in office, Kim Jong-un reportedly purged high-ranking officials from the government who could challenge his authority. North Korea has allegedly carried out 27 death sentences ever since Kim Jong-un became leader in 2011, human rights group Transitional Justice Working Group claimed, Daily Star reported. ""In 2012 or 2013 in Pyongyang an executed body was burned with a flame-thrower in front of a crowd following execution. The family of the accused was forced to attend the execution and sit in the front row to observe. The father fainted after watching his son burn in front of his eyes,"" a defector told the human rights group. Last month, a man was reportedly executed via a firing squad for allegedly smuggling copies of Netflix’s hit South Korean series “Squid Game” into North Korea through USBs.

12/21/2021,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Omicron infections no less severe based on early UK data Infections caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus do not appear to be less severe than infections from Delta, according to early data from the UK. Researchers at Imperial College London compared 11,329 people with confirmed or likely Omicron infections with nearly 200,000 people infected with other variants. So far, according to a report issued ahead of peer review and updated on Monday, they see ""no evidence of Omicron having lower severity than Delta, judged by either the proportion of people testing positive who report symptoms, or by the proportion of cases seeking hospital care after infection."" For vaccines available in the UK, effectiveness against symptomatic Omicron infection ranged from 0% to 20% after two doses, and from 55% to 80% following a booster dose. The report also estimated that after taking individual risk factors into account, the odds of reinfection with Omicron are 5.4 times greater than for reinfection with Delta. A study of healthcare workers in the pre-Omicron era estimated that a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection afforded 85% protection against a second infection over 6 months, the researchers said, while ""the protection against reinfection by Omicron afforded by past infection may be as low as 19%."" Sperm count, motility may be low for months after COVID-19 Sperm quality is impaired for months for some people after recovery from COVID-19, researchers have found. The semen itself was not infectious, the researchers found. But among 35 men who provided samples within a month after recovery from symptomatic infection, reductions in sperm motility were evident in 60% and sperm counts were reduced in 37%. As reported on Monday in Fertility and Sterility, semen samples were obtained from 120 Belgian men with an average age of 35 years, at an average of 52 days after their COVID-19 symptoms had resolved. Among 51 men tested between one and two months after recovery, 37% had reduced sperm motility and 29% had low sperm counts. Among 34 men who provided semen samples at least two months after recovery, sperm motility was impaired in 28% and sperm counts were low in 6%. The severity of COVID-19 infection was not correlated with sperm characteristics. ""Couples with a desire for pregnancy should be warned that sperm quality after COVID-19 infection can be suboptimal,"" the researchers concluded. ""The estimated recovery time is 3 months, but further follow-up studies are under way to confirm this and to determine if permanent damage occurred in a minority of men."" Neutralizing molecule could be cheaper than antibodies An experimental molecule that neutralizes the coronavirus in the same way antibodies do would be cheaper and easier to manufacture, researchers said. The molecule belongs to a class of compounds known as aptamers. Because they are made from RNA or DNA, aptamers are easier to synthesize than protein-based antibodies that can only be produced in living cells, said Julian Valero of Aarhus University in Denmark. Like antibodies, the aptamers attach themselves to protein targets - in this case, the spike protein on the virus surface - by folding into a three-dimensional conformation. A study published in PNAS shows that in test tube experiments, the aptamer binds tightly to the coronavirus spike, preventing it from breaking into human cells. It inhibits earlier variants of the virus, including Delta, the researchers said. They are planning tests to see whether it also recognizes and binds to Omicron. Use of the aptamer in patients is still far off, with tests in mice only recently begun. In terms of use in humans, ""we're much closer"" to being able to use the aptamer to help diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, said Jorgen Kjemsa, also of Aarhus University. Experiments comparing the use of the aptamer to antibodies in widely used rapid COVID-19 tests for infection are underway, he said.

12/21/2021,"“Spider-Man: No Way Home” star Jacob Batalon didn’t have to swing from building to building to get into shape. Batalon, who stars as Ned Leeds in the hit film, as well as several other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has dropped more than 100 pounds since 2020. “I decided to get into this sort of transformation, or this sort of journey, with my health and fitness at the end of 2019,” he told Men’s Health. “Even when I wasn’t doing anything physical, I found myself getting sleepy at work and it was because of all the fat food I was eating.” Batalon, 25, said he was lethargic before he had a wake-up call. “I felt like I could barely walk up stairs without being out of breath and this one day I kind of just saw myself without a shirt on and it was just ridiculous,’ he said. “I could not believe I let myself get this far. That’s what sort of started it all.” Batalon got a trainer and he spent a lot of 2020 transforming his overall health. He ultimately lost 112 pounds. “I found a lot of light in the dark in the sense that a lot of people were suffering and I was fortunate and lucky enough to have found my health and all those things,” he said. Batalon hits the gym about six days a week, usually for about 90 minutes, with an hour spent on lifting weights and 30 minutes on cardio. It’s not exercise alone that has helped, though. He said he was encouraged to take up a plant-based diet, which can help people lose weight. “Recently, my girlfriend has actually gotten me into a plant-based diet, as well, and that’s really helped my body and I can feel the difference between eating a lot of meat and eating plant-based stuff and that’s really helped me, as well,” he said. Batalon hopes he can inspire others, too, with his own experience. “If there’s anything that I’d want to say to anyone who’s trying to start a journey like myself, I think that the first step is to just do it,” he said.

12/21/2021,"Curious why the day after a night out drinking you feel more sped up and anxious than usual? You're not alone. The term ""hangxiety"" is growing in popularity and just may be replacing the physical symptoms of a hangover as the most dreaded post-bender consequence there is. According to Dr. Jiseung Yoon, an addiction-medicine specialist who works with the online alcohol treatment program Monument, late-night revelers often experience symptoms of anxiety like an increased heart rate and difficulty breathing the day after they overindulge in alcohol. ""The anxiety symptoms are from the alcohol leaving your body,"" Yoon tells Yahoo Life, explaining that the process is a withdrawal cycle. When an individual drinks alcohol, their brain becomes excited and produces pleasurable feelings. Once the alcohol wears off, your brain goes into overdrive, seeking more of the substance. ""For many people it lasts until they start drinking again, and it's a negative cycle,"" says Yoon. ""For binge-drinkers, it's a little bit worse because their brain gets sensitized to alcohol: When they drink, their brain is happy, but when they stop drinking for a period of time, the brain reacts [with anxiety symptoms] until they start drinking again."" For Patricia Frierson, who will celebrate two years of sobriety later this month, the feeling of hangxiety is all-too-familiar.  ""When I was drinking, I experienced hangxiety daily,"" she says. ""There were times it would become so brutal that I would find myself standing over a bathroom sink splashing my fully make-upped face with ice cold water while shaking. I would drink so much at night that when I woke up in the morning I would wake up in a hyper-anxious state and refused to correlate the two, selfishly."" Among her hangxiety symptoms, Frierson lists headaches, an upset stomach, shaking, feelings of fear and overwhelm and shortness of breath. ""I was diagnosed with general anxiety disorder as well as situational anxiety before I started drinking,"" Frierson adds, ""but drinking made it so much worse: I would have a great day at work, because I was sober, start drinking immediately when I got home and would find myself in a bad situations."" Yoon says for those who have an anxiety diagnosis, hangxiety can be more severe. But are there precautions you can take before a night of drinking to minimize the next day's anxiety? Yoon says it's unlikely. ""The only way to prevent it is to not drink alcohol,"" he says. ""If you do drink, the following day you can drink plenty of water and eat, because that will make you physically better, and then try things people usually do for normal anxiety like deep breathing exercises or relaxation exercises could also be very helpful. But, there isn't much you can do besides not drinking to prevent those feelings of anxiety."" Whenever I'm dealing with a difficult situation or I'm emotionally dysregulated in some way, I absolutely 100 percent do not drink.""Tara Schuster Tara Schuster, an entertainment executive and author of Buy Yourself the F***ing Lilies, who speaks candidly about her own relationship with alcohol in her best-selling book, says putting an end to drinking alcohol once and for all may be the best way to cope with hangxiety. ""When I drink, what I've noticed is the very next day, even if I'm in a good place, I am more anxious,"" says Schuster. ""Alcohol is a depressant and when s***'s going wrong, that's not the time to take the edge off. The edge just might be keeping you from the abyss, so whenever I'm dealing with a difficult situation or I’m emotionally dysregulated in some way, I absolutely 100 percent do not drink."" In addition to feelings of anxiety, Schuster says drinking alcohol often messes with her sleep patterns and makes her feel physically unwell. In her book, she shares that one of her personal rules about consuming alcohol is that she doesn't drink alone, so Schuster says she's barely drank at all during the pandemic. Click and scroll in the window below to explore the body after 30 days without alcohol. ""I haven't been drinking this year and I feel the healthiest I've ever felt,"" she says. ""Why am I in this s***storm dumpster fire madness of the world and also the most mentally healthy? I would be very surprised if there wasn't some kind of correlation between me not making a choice that I know makes me feel bad and feeling the best I've ever felt."" Schuster says when we feel like we ""need a drink,"" it's time to pause for a beat and ask which feelings we're hoping to turn off or self-medicate with alcohol. ""People use alcohol as a numbing mechanism,"" she explains. ""We say, 'I had a really hard day at work, let me have a glass of Pinot Noir.' Or we get in a fight with our partner so we have a cocktail or as an anecdote to a stressful job, we're like, 'Rosé all day, bitches,' on the weekends and that is so f***ed up. Basically what you're doing is putting lighter fluid on an already difficult situation.""    A post shared by T$ aka Tara Schuster (@taraschuster) Frierson agrees. ""[Sobriety] has been the hardest-fought battle of my life,"" says the South Carolina mom of two. ""But outside of being a mom, it's been the most rewarding."" ""I started going to therapy and practicing a myriad of techniques that help me make it through the moments where I feel some of the symptoms are used to when I was drinking,"" she continues. ""[My anxiety] doesn't always go away completely, but it grounds me enough that I find myself again and don't look for alcohol to make me whole.""

12/21/2021,"Ebony Wilkerson, the woman who made international news in 2014 when she drove her minivan packed with kids into the rolling surf in Daytona Beach, was released on Friday from nearly all of her remaining court-ordered supervision. But Circuit Judge Raul Zambrano ordered that SMA Healthcare randomly check with Wilkerson’s doctors in South Carolina to ensure that she continues taking her long-lasting Abilify injections and stays out of legal trouble. “I don’t want to minimize your efforts,” Zambrano said. “I think everyone recognizes you have done very, very well and that you have improved in terms of insight to your medical issues and that you have done everything possible to correct them."" The 40-year-old Wilkerson, who appeared by Zoom, nodded her head as the judge spoke about her gaining insight. But Zambrano said that people with mental illness take medications which make them feel better. Then they sometimes think they don’t need the medication and stop taking them. Zambrano said that he wanted to keep checking on Wilkerson so that if she stopped taking her medication or some other problem occurred, she could be summoned to a hearing or taken into custody if necessary. “I want to release some of the burden on you, but at the same time I’m not ready to let you go free completely without any further supervision,” Zambrano said. Wilkerson said little during the hearing, except for responding to the judges questions about who her medical providers were in South Carolina. A Christmas tree could be seen behind her and a teenage boy at one time came into camera view briefly but said nothing. Wilkerson has been in custody or under supervision since March 4, 2014, when she drove her minivan into rough, rolling surf near the Silver Beach Avenue approach. Wilkerson was pregnant at the time and inside the van with her were her two daughters, ages 10 and 3 at the time, and her son, 9 at the time. The children could be heard screaming as waves rocked the van and people ran to rescue them. Everyone survived and Wilkerson subsequently gave birth at Halifax Health Medical Center while she was in the custody at the Volusia County Branch Jail. At a court hearing before Circuit Judge Leah Case in December 2014, Wilkerson testified that she was thinking God was with her and that her children needed a cleansing when she drove into the surf. ""I just kept going, kept following the Holy Spirit,"" Wilkerson said. ""I was following the Holy Spirit wherever it went.” Wilkerson also said that she did not realize that day that her children could have been harmed by her driving into the surf. She said she was not trying to hurt them. A psychiatrist for the state testified that Wilkerson had a schizoaffective disorder. Judge Case found Wilkerson not guilty by reason of insanity to three counts of felony child abuse and then committed her to a state psychiatric hospital. Wilkerson was released from the state psychiatrist hospital to a transitional facility only to get in trouble again when she stopped taking her medication in May 2016. But during the hearing on Friday, a psychiatrist testifying for the state noted she had been compliant for the past four years. Assistant State Attorney Kevin Sullivan said Wilkerson was doing well, but he still would like to monitor that she is taking her injectable medication at least for some period of time. A psychological expert for the state, Will Meadows, testified that Wilkerson has been doing the best since he became involved in the case shortly after her arrest. He praised Wilkerson’s progress and said she was at “low risk.” “She’s definitely improved considerably,” Meadows said. “She’s done everything that’s been required of her. My main concern is she does have a history of getting off her meds.” Wilkerson’s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Jay Crocker, had asked the court to end its jurisdiction in the case. He said that Wilkerson’s own psychologist, who has been treating her for 4.5 years, said she believes Wilkerson can be freed from conditional release. He said that SMA forensic case managers also agreed that she could be released. Zambrano did not go that far, but did reduce supervision. SMA will no longer have to complete regular reports about Wilkerson. Instead, health officials will randomly check in with her doctors, not Wilkerson, to ensure she is taking her medications and staying out of trouble. “This relieves some of the burden that she has, lets her go on with her life,” Zambrano said. “But we are going to be monitoring her behind the scenes. In a couple of years, we can look at it again.” This article originally appeared on The Daytona Beach News-Journal: Ebony Wilkerson, drove van with kids into Daytona surf, mostly freed",U.S./Daytona Beach News-Journal,"Ebony Wilkerson, who drove van with kids into ocean in Daytona, released from most supervision",https://news.yahoo.com/ebony-wilkerson-drove-van-kids-164532474.html
