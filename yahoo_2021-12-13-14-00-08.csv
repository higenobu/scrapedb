12/13/2021,"Chris Christie said this weekend that the events leading up to Jan. 6 were ""driven by the top."" Christie pointed the finger at the ""C-team players"" around Trump, blaming them for the Capitol riot. He said Trump was reluctant to concede the election, and spurred on by people telling him what he wanted to hear. Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie gave his take on the events leading up to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, calling it a process ""driven from the top"" and ""executed by C-team players."" Christie made these comments on Sunday, in an appearance on ABC News' ""This Week"" hosted by George Stephanopoulos. The former governor was responding to a comment from Stephanopoulos about a PowerPoint presentation sent by then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows detailing how the Trump team could work to overturn the election. —This Week (@ThisWeekABC) December 12, 2021 ""It seems like, every single day, Chris Christie, we're learning more about what was going inside the White House in those days leading up to Jan. 6,"" Stephanopoulos said, referencing the Meadows PowerPoint presentation. ""It may explain why the former president and his allies are working so hard not to cooperate."" Christie replied that the things that are being revealed now about the Jan. 6 riot were ""driven from the top."" ""I mean, the president made it very clear that he did not want to concede the election, that he would not concede the election. And you got a bunch of people around him by the time we got to the end, with very few exceptions, that were C-team players, at best, on their best day,"" Christie said. The former governor added that these ""C-team players"" told former President Donald Trump what he wanted to hear. ""There were plenty of people on the outside who were telling him this is over, and you need to concede. He didn't want to hear that,"" Christie said. Christie was critical of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to block House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's GOP picks for the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. ""The problem now is that because she dictated — for the first time in my memory — who the minority party could have on a committee, it does affect to some extent among people in my party, the credibility the committee has,"" he said, before adding that he thought the committee is doing ""important work."" ""In the end, the facts are going to come out, but let's not kid ourselves. This was a driven-from-the-top process executed by C-team players. And that's why it looks like a Keystone Cops operation, because it was,"" Christie said. Christie's new comments are his latest salvo in an ongoing feud with the former president. On Nov. 8, Christie urged Trump to ""move on"" from the 2020 election and ""tell the truth."" Trump then released a statement the next day via his spokeswoman, Liz Harrington, claiming Christie was ""just absolutely massacred by his statements that Republicans have to move on from the past, meaning the 2020 Election Fraud."" ""Everybody remembers that Chris left New Jersey with a less than 9% approval rating — a record low, and they didn't want to hear this from him!"" Trump said in his Nov. 9 statement. Trump on Dec. 8 also put out a statement via Harrington, commenting on how sales of his book ""dwarf Chris Christie's."" Separately, Christie also accused Trump of withholding his COVID-positive test status and transmitting the virus to him.

12/13/2021,"As we imagine an all-green future, it appears that nearly everything can be powered by electricity produced without burning coal, oil, or gas. Cars are already beginning to transition to electric. Homes can be heated and cooled with heat pumps. Many railroads are already electrified. Ships can run on small atomic reactors, used by naval submarines for two thirds of a century. But airplanes will be a problem. They already spew out a significant percentage of annual carbon dioxide. If air travel continues increasing, its climate-threatening carbon dioxide output would also increase. Recent reports about possible new supersonic jets, which would burn five to seven times as much fuel per passenger-mile as today's aircraft, suggest that future air travel could be vastly more of a climate threat. Unlike heat pumps and trains, airliners cannot be plugged into the electrical grid. Unlike automobiles, airplanes cannot carry the heavy batteries needed to move large numbers of passengers or freight long distances. Unlike ships, aircraft cannot run on atomic power; the shielding to protect passengers and crew from radiation would weigh more than planes can handle. Small, battery-powered aircraft that can travel short distances look promising, but are unlikely to be scaled up to haul large numbers long distances. To save the climate, it may become necessary to discontinue all other air travel completely. Since rapid transportation is now taken for granted, this would be a major shock. Many well-paying jobs in the airline and aircraft production industries would disappear. Powerful vested economic interests would oppose this move. But as ""Swami Beyondananda"" recently put it, ""if we lose the earth, there goes the GDP."" And new jobs opened up in other transportation modes would absorb many if not all of the displaced workers. Ending long distance air travel would have major upsides. It would greatly slow down the spread of infectious diseases from one country to another. And it would would require eliminating military aircraft, and missiles. (Rockets put out tons of carbon dioxide.) This would render all countries more secure from surprise attack and save immense amounts of taxpayer money. If nearly all transportation returned to the earth's surface, railroads would regain their past importance, but with more high speed trains like those in Europe and China. Intercontinental travel would be mainly on ocean liners. It might be possible, though, to connect the western and eastern hemispheres by railroad across the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia's Siberia. Of course new technology — such as hydrogen — might allow long distance air travel to continue without putting out climate-wrecking carbon dioxide. But new technology is always speculative. So we need to think about how we could end air travel with a minimum amount of pain. Ending air travel would not just affect passengers. Air freight transports critical parts that go into things produced in other countries, not to mention consumer goods. Abruptly ending air travel would cause terrible problems for those needing these goods and critical parts. It would be better to give economies time to adjust by phasing it out gradually. Fuel extravagant supersonic airliners not being here yet, it might be best just to stop developing them. Prudent investors should avoid financing this research. If we begin reducing air travel soon, it would avoid a sudden shock to the world economy at some future time. An ideal policy could impose an increasing carbon price, gradually making air travel so expensive that it would become rare. Perhaps the most unavoidable pain would come from the need to stop putting communications satellites into orbit around the Earth. However aside from GPS services these satellites could be replaced by additional fiberoptic cables. Instead of space travel, we could concentrate on preserving and improving life on earth. Radical idea! We may just have to learn to live without GPS services. Life is tough! — Paul F. deLespinasse is professor emeritus of political science and computer science at Adrian College.

12/13/2021,"The Miss Universe pageant has been through a lot over the decades — from the 21-year Trump-owned era (and his fat-shaming of 1996 winner Alicia Machado, tabloid fodder for the 2016 elections) to host Steve Harvey’s gaffe of announcing the wrong winner in 2015 (making a similar mistake in 2019), causing awkwardness and confusion onstage and off. And when the 70th Anniversary Miss Universe kicks off this weekend in Eilat, Israel, airing on Sunday evening on Fox and again hosted by Harvey (following the preliminary competition, held on Friday), it will likely not disappoint in the drama department — at least if the weeks leading up to it have offered any indication. The pageant, often confused with that of Miss America, is set apart in many ways — including by being a for-profit company (unlike the nonprofit Miss America), founded in 1952 by Catalina Swimsuits as a promotional tool after that year's Miss America, Yolande Betzbeze, refused to appear at events wearing a bathing suit and that organization dropped Catalina as a sponsor. While the pageant organization was formerly owned by Donald Trump (from 1995-2015), it's currently owned by WME. Rules for the competitors include being between 18 and 28, not being married or divorced, never having given birth and not being any child's legal guardian, not being pregnant and ""recognized medically and legally as a female,"" able to show proof ""if your gender or sex designated at birth was not female."" While the late Bob Barker was a popular host of the contest (and Miss USA) for 20 years, Harvey is returning for his sixth year, and his 24-year-old daughter, Lori Harvey, is part of the selection committee — along with supermodel Adriana Lima, Miss Universe 2016 Iris Mittenaere, actresses Urvashi Rautela, Marian Rivera, Adamari López and The Bold and the Beautiful's Rena Sofer. Performers are set to include JoJo and Israeli vocalist Noa Kirel. Among the 80 contestants — officially called ""delegates""— is Miss USA Elle Smith of Kentucky, a TV news reporter for her local WHAS who beat out the rest of the state reps including Miss Nevada Kataluna Enriquez, who made history as the first transgender woman to contend for the Miss USA crown but was eliminated early, telling Yahoo Life, ""I think they were just not ready."" Elle, emailing Yahoo Life this week from Eilat, says she's rooming with host country's Miss Israel Noa Cochva, making it ""an amazing experience being able to learn about the culture and country directly from a local."" Among the many other notable contestants with unique life experiences include Miss Belgium Kedist Deltour, who, as a child born in Ethiopia, briefly lived on the street after her mother died, until she and her brother were placed in an orphanage and adopted by a Belgian couple. Miss Curacao Shariëngela Cijntje, also the product of childhood resilience, suffered from burns over 80 percent of her body when she was just 3 years old.  Miss Costa Rica Valeria Rees, meanwhile, started a platform called Open Cage on which she speaks honestly about her experience with anorexia, while Miss Turkey Cemrenaz Turhan is a pro-volleyball player. Miss Philippines Beatrice Luigi Gomez is proudly bisexual and became the first member of the LGBTQ community to win the Miss Universe Philippines title, while Miss El Salvador Alejandra Gavidia is an asexual activist who noted, ""Asexuals are invisible, we are the ghosts of the LGBTIQ + community."" And Miss Puerto Rico Michelle Marie Colon grabbed Israeli headlines recently when she announced in an Instagram post, alongside a photo of herself visiting the Yad Vashem World Holocaust Center in Jerusalem, that her great-grandfather was a Holocaust survivor.    A post shared by ꧁Miss Universe PR 2021꧂ (@michellemariecolon) First, this is technically the second Miss Universe of the year, as 2020's competition was caught in a COVID delay, and wound up being postponed to May 2021, when it took place in Hollywood, Fla., crowning Andrea Meza of Mexico the winner. But the effects of COVID are carrying over into this contest, as well: Detection of the new Omicron variant in Israel occurred just as pageant contestants were arriving from all corners of the globe — barely squeaking into the country as it announced, on Nov. 28, a near-total ban on foreign tourists entering its borders. Miss France, Clemence Botino, tested positive for COVID upon arrival and was put into solitary quarantine for 10 days, noting on her Instagram, ""I have been crying all day."" She now appears to have recovered and be back in the running.    A post shared by Clémence Botino 🌸 (@clemencebotinooff) Still, the pandemic now hangs like a cloud over the closely watched event, with Hagai Levine, a professor of public health at Hebrew University who spoke with The Daily Beast, pointing to how the situation of contestants coming from all over the world served to highlight global vaccine inequality. ""Miss Universe, specifically, is an event that should be leveraged to show that we’re all in this together,"" he said. ""With the women competing representing most nations on earth, we should acknowledge that we as humanity have failed. At the crucial moment, we didn't display solidarity."" The Omicron variant, Levine added, ""should make it very clear that no one is safe until everyone is safe, and it seems a bit in poor taste that some of these women come from nations without access to vaccines."" Though Smith tells Yahoo Life that Israel ""is a lovely place"" that she plans on visiting again, and that people's ""preconceived notions"" about other countries tend to ""dissipate after learning about the culture and meeting residents,"" others are apparently more reticent about the event taking place in the country known for its controversial policies — namely now-former Miss Greece Rafaela Plastira.  She's the delegate who reportedly withdrew from the contest in protest, saying in October, ""I love all countries from all over the world but my heart goes to all the people fighting for their lives in Israel & Palestina. I can't go up that stage and act like nothing is happening when people are fighting for their lives out there."" But then, strangely adding to the drama, came subsequent, confusing reports that said Plastira was never selected to represent Greece anyway, and that her statement about withdrawing was ""false."" According to a statement posted on Facebook by Giorgos Kouvaris, president of Star & Mr GS Hellas, ""I would like to inform all Greeks that GS Hellas is the only body that selects the participants in the Miss Universe 2021. Anything else is false and malicious.”    A post shared by Star & Mr GS Hellas (@starandmr.gshellas) Plastira, he added, ""won the Star Hellas 2019 title, and this is the only title she has. She was never supposed to represent our country in the Miss Universe pageant."" He said that the Greek representative for the official Miss Universe pageant is Sofia Arapogianni — although apparently, Arapogianni came only after Katerina Kouvoutsaki, who was reportedly replacing Plastira until she announced she was withdrawing for ""health reasons"" which would not allow her to travel. Beyond the Greece situation, ""false"" or not, the South African government announced in late November that it was withdrawing its support for the Miss South Africa pageant, due to Miss Universe being held in Israel, where ""the atrocities committed by Israel against Palestinians are well documented,"" Minister of Arts, Sport and Culture Nathi Mthethwa said in a statement, according to ABC News. That sparked criticism from the South African Jewish Board of Entities, with national director Wendy Kahn saying through a statement: ""South Africa has diplomatic ties and extensive commercial trade relations with Israel. It engages in events such as this one, such as hosting the Israeli Davis Cup team in 2018. The way we influence situations is to engage, not to withdraw."" Miss South Africa Lalela Mswane, a 24-year-old model, ballerina and Zulu woman, appears to have not addressed the controversy, and is indeed in Israel, according to her social media.    A post shared by 𝐿𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑙𝑎 𝐿𝑎𝑙𝑖 🇿🇦 (@lalela_mswane) This is not the first Israel-based Miss Universe controversy, by the way; in 2015, Miss Lebanon Saly Greige came under fire posing with Miss Israel Doron Matalon and others in a photo that Matalon had posted to social media. Lebanese citizens can be imprisoned for contact with Israelis, as the countries have been at war since 2006, but Greige said at the time, ""Since the first day of my arrival to participate I was very cautious to avoid being in any photo or communication with Miss Israel,"" who, she alleges, ""jumped in"" to the photo. While it's anyone's contest at this point, Miss Puerto Rico Michelle Marie Colon is among those favored to land in the top 10 — as is Miss Philippines Beatrice Luigi Gomez and delegates from Chile, Spain, Colombia and Brazil — according to aficionados including those on pageant message boards, this popular YouTuber and the pageant site Missosology. As a Missosology story on top picks notes, there is an ""astounding number of front-runners,"" though it is, of course, ""still early in the game to make any definite predictions.""
