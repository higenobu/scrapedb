1/23/2022,"After becoming Britain’s newest – and perhaps most unlikely – World Cup winner, Dave “the Rocket” Ryding, a 35-year-old slalom skier from Chorley in Lancashire, has set his sights on surprising the world again at next month’s Winter Olympics.  Until Saturday no British skier had ever won a gold medal in the 55-year history of the Alpine World Cup. But Ryding’s stunning victory in Kitzbühel changed all that – and earned him 100,000 euros in the process. When asked about what went through his mind on the start line before his remarkable second run, which took him from sixth place to first, Ryding was disarmingly honest. “I thought: ‘Bugger it, I’ll just try and get down and ski as well as I can and see where that gets me,’” he replied. The performance made Ryding the oldest ever winner of a men’s World Cup slalom event, but afterwards he was too tired to celebrate with a few drinks. “I am too old for that,” he said, smiling. “I am absolutely shattered. We had a nice meal.” The popular skier will soon travel to Beijing for his fourth Winter Olympic Games – where he admits, to borrow a phrase from Sir Alex Ferguson, that it will be “squeaky-bum time”. “Of course I’m going to have pressure and of course people are going to expect I will do well,” he admitted. “At my last Olympics I got to the start gate and it was squeaky-bum time. “And I’ll be nervous again because it’s the biggest race in the four years. It’s the pinnacle. I’ll be expecting myself to ski well but whatever happens I can go home knowing I’ve got a World Cup victory.” That win was the culmination of a near 30-year journey, which began when Ryding started learning to ski aged six on the 50m Pendle dry slope in Lancashire. However it was only when he was 12 that he tried skiing on snow for the first time – after his working-class parents promised they would take their first family skiing holiday if he and his sister, Jo, got to a decent level. His father Carl, a market trader who retrained as a gas engineer to help fund their son’s dreams, and his mother Shirley, a hairdresser, then spent weekends driving Ryding around the country to race. However, they made him pass his A-levels before agreeing he could spend a year trying to make his love of skiing into a career. “I had to learn everything later as I wasn’t exposed to the mountains until I was older,” he admitted. “It was a tough learning curve but I wouldn’t change anything.” Ryding’s road to the top continued to have nearly as many sharp twists and turns as an Alpine pass. But he believes years of living on the breadline helped make him the skier he is today. “In 2010 when the old federation went bankrupt and we had nothing, that was a time where it was tough, really hard,” he said. “It was just me and my coach on the road. But it made me as well and gave me the determination, it gave me the work ethic and just that nothing is given for free.” “Doubt is always there,” added Ryding, who made his World Cup debut in Alta Badia in 2009 and was competing in his 97th race on Saturday. “You do one race and you’re not happy with it, you’re down in the dumps again, you pick yourself up, you get slapped back down again. It’s relentless but you learn to deal with it, to push out of the gate and go for it.” When asked if he had plans to spend his 100,000 euro prize money, his reply was blunt: “No, I am a tight arse!” “I’m fortunate since I’ve been in the top 15 in the world to make a living,” he added. “Footballers earn more in a week than I do in a year. But I’m not complaining. I was absolutely fine with coming away with nothing at 30 if it didn’t work out. That’s what I was prepared to do. And now Kitzbühel. If you are going to win one for prize money it is this one.” Ryding also hopes that his victory can inspire the next generation of British skiers to come through. Meanwhile he also has a wedding to his fiancée, Mandy, to look forward to in May. But, for now, his focus is the Olympics. “When you win a World Cup three weeks before the Olympics it’s natural for everyone to talk,” he admitted. “Obviously the pressure and expectation will have ramped up but I won’t be defined by an Olympics. I’ve had an amazing career that I’m proud of. To win one has taken the weight off my shoulders. “It was a crazy day and it’s been a crazy journey. But I never stopped believing that I could do it.”",Sport/Sport,‘Squeaky-bum time’: Ryding targets Olympic gold after shock World Cup win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/squeaky-bum-time-ryding-targets-olympic-gold-after-shock-world-cup-win
1/23/2022,"Joe Biden marked his first anniversary in office with a gaffe over Ukraine that undid weeks of disciplined messaging and diplomatic preparation.  The president’s suggestion that a “minor incursion” by Russia might split Nato over how to respond sent the White House into frantic damage limitation mode. Officials insisted Biden had been referring to cyber attacks and paramilitary activities and not Russian troops crossing the border. That failed to entirely calm nerves in Kyiv and other European capitals, especially as Biden also raised eyebrows by predicting that Vladimir Putin would “move in” to Ukraine because “he has to do something” and would probably prevail. The analysis of Nato’s weaknesses and Putin’s intentions was no doubt widely shared but Biden had said the quiet part loud, contradicting what his own officials had been saying. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, had just been telling Foreign Policy that one of the great successes of the Biden administration was that “the 30 allies of Nato [were] speaking with one voice in the Russia-Ukraine crisis”. Aides who have shadowed Biden through his long career as senator and vice-president are used to his prolix ways, his tendency to draw on his deep foreign policy expense to over-explain, but the stakes are immeasurably greater as a president, trying to stare down Putin as Europe stands on the threshold of war. The stumble distracted from some of the foreign policy achievements of Biden’s first year – the mending of transatlantic ties, the bolstering of US support for the embattled government in Kyiv and the development of a consistent policy towards Moscow – which combined a openness to talks with a readiness to inflict punitive measures and a refusal to be divided from Nato allies. None of those gains were a given in US foreign policy after four years of Donald Trump, a president who frequently put domestic political and business advantage ahead of strategic national interests, particularly when it came to Russia. Mending alliances, returning to multilateralism and restoring predictability to US policy after the volatile Trump era is widely regarded as Biden’s greatest success so far in foreign policy. His claim on taking office that “America is back” was backed up by a quick deal to extend the New Start treaty in Russia and thereby salvage the only major arms control agreement to survive Trump. The US rejoined the Paris climate accord and the United Nations Human Rights Council, re-engaged with major powers in nuclear talks with Iran, and convened a virtual Summit for Democracy in December. All those steps were in line with a broad strategy which Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute of International Affairs, describes as a Biden doctrine. “I think it’s a strategic reorientation towards competition/conflict with China and, the other side of that coin, strengthening relationships with partners in Europe and in Asia, both bilaterally and multilaterally,” Tocci said. “And relying less on the military instrument in order to pursue US foreign policy goals.” The Ukraine stumble was not the first time that strategy has been impaired by its execution. The withdrawal from Afghanistan was intended to be a decisive break with the past, extricating the US from its longest war so it could focus on its most important geopolitical challenge, the rapid rise of China. The departure turned to chaos when the Afghan army, which the US had spent $83m and 20 years trying to build, collapsed in a few days in the face of a Taliban offensive. The scenes of desperate Afghans trying to cling to departing US planes, some dying in the attempt, are an inescapable part of Biden’s legacy. Biden has argued he was boxed in by the Doha agreement the Trump administration signed with the Taliban in February 2020, under which the US was due to leave by May 2021. Biden was able to stretch that deadline by four months but maintained that staying any longer would have led to renewed attacks on US troops. Nathan Sales, an acting under secretary of state in the Trump administration, argued that the Doha deal was no longer binding on Biden, and he could have left a force to maintain US leverage. “When one side of an agreement breaches it serially and flagrantly like the Taliban did, I think the Biden administration would have been well within its rights to say: ‘We’re not bound by it either,’” said Sales, now a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Current US officials argue that whether the US declared the Taliban had been in violation or not, there would have been renewed attacks on US troops, forcing a decision to cut and run or send large-scale reinforcements. The status quo, they say, was not sustainable. Even considering the constraints imposed by the previous administration, the withdrawal was a fiasco. US planners failed to anticipate the speed of the collapse even though a government watchdog, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, had warned in 2021 that without US contractors to service planes and helicopters, the Afghan air force would no longer be able to function, depriving troops on the ground of a key advantage. For Afghans who worked with the US and its allies, and for the country’s women and girls, the departure seemed like a betrayal, raising a serious question mark over the administration’s claims to have restored human rights to the heart of US foreign policy. Its record in that regard was already mixed. On one hand, the administration had taken a firm stand against China’s mass persecution of Muslim Uyghurs, declaring it a genocide. Furthermore, the assembly of a coalition of some 130 countries to establish a global minimum tax was, according to Matt Duss, foreign affairs adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders, “a step toward addressing global economic inequality which is one of the drivers of conflict and authoritarianism”. “It’s an important first step and a courageous one,” Duss said. He also pointed to the sanctions against surveillance companies like the Israeli NSO group, whose software was used by authoritarian regimes to target dissidents. “​​That was a very consequential move, and there has been a massive pressure campaign trying to get them to roll it back, but they’ve stood firm,” he said. However, the steps taken against the Saudi monarchy for the heavy civilian toll from its air war in Yemen and the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi felt well short of what human rights campaigners and progressive Democrats had hoped for. The Biden administration continued to sell Riyadh substantial quantities of advanced weaponry. “We’ve basically returned to the traditional US approach of supporting human rights in countries that don’t buy our weapons,” Duss said. “I very much hope that changes.” Another way in which the manner of the US exit from Afghanistan undermined the administration’s wider objectives was by alienating European allies, who felt left out of a decision they were obliged to follow. “The pull-out really caused a lot of bad blood unnecessarily,” Elisabeth Braw, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said. “You can call it the root cause of unhappiness within the alliance.” The formation in September of Aukus, a partnership with the UK and Australia to help the latter acquire nuclear-powered submarines, was another sweeping move in the pivot towards Asia. But the protagonists had omitted to inform France, who discovered on the same day that their contract to sell Australia diesel submarines had been cancelled. Biden was forced to acknowledge the “clumsy” way it had been handled, and the rift clouded bilateral relations for months. Putin’s threat to Ukraine has helped rally the transatlantic alliance but as Biden revealed in his own public reflections, there are still serious divisions below the surface, limiting his room for manoeuvre. The president’s freedom of action on other global issues, like making progress in climate action or finding a nuclear compromise with Iran, will be hindered still further if Republicans gain control of Congress in this year’s midterm elections. In that case, the administration’s record until now, mixed as it is, may prove to be the high point of the Biden doctrine.",News/US news,The Biden doctrine: Ukraine gaffe sums up mixed year of foreign policy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/23/biden-ukraine-russia-foreign-policy-afghanistan-china-nato

1/23/2022,"Why are the Tories pulled to the right by fringe parties, but Labour are pulled to the centre? Barry Kington, Worcester Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com.  “The centre is where the votes are,” apparently. Evidence (SDP, TIGgers, LibDems) suggest otherwise. But there again, the rightwing media keep telling us differently. JoeRobson It’s the centre where one finds voters who might change their opinion. Both the Tories and Labour have a bedrock of supporters (roughly 25% of voters) who will vote for them come what may. About 25-30% on the electoral roll don’t vote (regrettably), that leaves about 20%-25% who are not strongly committed to one party or another, might change their minds, and thus can change the outcome of the election. Mark_MK Because Labour is constantly led by people who don’t really have principles, they just have a desire for power. Most of the media want rightwing policies, so they attack anyone on the left, tolerate those in the centre, and support those on the right. Rather than stand up for socialist policies and principles that benefit ordinary people, the likes of Starmer and Blair think that they need the support of Murdoch and his cronies in the media, so they do what’s necessary to “win” their support, which is basically to offer us a “lite” version of the Tory brand. donpittodrie I suspect there are a lot of reasons. The longstanding parties of the left (eg SWP, SPEW etc) don’t stand against Labour as getting the Tories out is seen as the priority. The Labour left has also been seen as the fringe of polite society, and may concentrate in Labour strongholds, and so pose less of an existential threat. Centrist parties, on the other hand, are more likely to take existing MPs and floating voters with them. Money is also a factor: any rightward drift, for either party, will take donors. A left/right spectrum oversimplifies things, too. In 2015, many Labour voters defected to Ukip, without going through the Tory party, because they shared a social conservatism, as well as a distaste for the EU. When the Tories were seen to move to the right, rejecting a certain kind of metropolitan elitism, it was easy for them to hoover up those votes when Ukip’s vote collapsed after the referendum. JasonJdo The question frames the argument badly. A clearer and more truthful formulation would be “why do both parties drift rightwards?” There are various answers to that, but one is certainly the nature of our media, largely owned by a small coterie of billionaires who are so patriotic they take good care to minimise their tax in the UK, but still never hesitate to lecture us about patriotism. Left-leaning policies will be attacked ferociously, as will those who espouse them. Right-leaning policies will be seen as “sound, grown-up and realistic”. Whispering_Ned The Tories are being pulled to the extreme right and Labour are moving to the centre-right to take up the space vacated by the Tories as the “moderate” wing of the Tory party has disintegrated. Only politics to the right of centre are now acceptable to the UK establishment, with anything even vaguely to the left being aggressively dismissed as leftwing extremism. By today’s standards, the postwar Attlee government, with its creation of the NHS would be labelled as communist. emmasdad The concept of right and left go back to the those on the right bank of the Seine being wealthy and those on the left being more politically progressive. That seems to have become hopelessly outdated – it is more down to the Tories’ politics being more appealing to the authoritarian wealthy who want to keep the less wealthy down while having direct access to their money and labour. Those in Labour are greater in numbers but have less access to the one thing that makes a difference, wealth. Labour therefore has to compromise to attract enough of the Tory heartlands than is comfortable for those in the more “progressive” parts of the party and this inevitably creates tensions and inevitably leads to more infighting. The Tories have no problems like that, they just do greed and they find that alone holds them together. MadorKallan No. It refers to the seating position of the MPs (députés) in the first national assembly in 1789 on each side of the president of the assembly (supporters of the king to his right; supporters of the revolution to his left). ceciler Because we let the prevailing rightwing media define the field of play Because we focus on “winning”, not on transformative ideas and actions Because we have failed to tell a better story than either the old bankrupt socialist story or the negative smug neoliberal story or the imperialist Britain first story Because we allow Peter Mandelson and his ilk to replay the Blair years Because we have a system the has polarised and leaves no room for the margins Because we do not have PR, but stick to first-past-the-post voting. thisfragiletent Part of the problem is that the centre of gravity for British politics is in Washington not London. Clinton begat Blair, and Trump spawned Johnson. It is not right or left but British politics itself that is pulled whichever way the Americans move. Splutterer When I was an undergraduate at Manchester in 1978, I snook into a Conservative Students meeting with Sir Keith Joseph. What he said was etched into my memory partly because at the time I thought he was bonkers and then later mainly because I had the painful experience of living to see that he was horrifically portentous. “The problem with British politics is that it is too leftwing,” he said. “When we get into office we are going to change that. We are going to slowly ratchet the parameters of the debate to the right. We will arrange it so that what is the centre now will become the extreme left and the centre will be way over to the right. This will have the effect of pulling Labour from where it is now to the right of where Ted Heath’s government was. We will make socialism impossible.”The rightward drift is/was a deliberate act. EJCribb Some people who post on here think people don’t read the papers any more. Many of the very poor buy papers because the majority don’t have access to the internet. Tabloids – mostly rightwing – still carry a lot of weight in working-class areas; even when people don’t buy them, the huge headlines are sending a subliminal message every time people walk past a newspaper rack. sydney1894 Because there are two orthogonal spectrums and neither Labour, nor Conservative MPs are a good fit to the UK population. Economically, the population sits a little to the right of the typical Labour MP but the Conservative economic view is a far-out minority opinion. But on the authoritarian spectrum, the population is, if anything, more extreme than the Conservative MPs. So Labour MPs need to move a little right on economics, and a lot right on “liberal values” to pick up more voters, while the Conservative MPs need to move right on the authoritarian spectrum but very left on the economic spectrum to align with the median population. But Conservative MPs are attracted to the party on economics, so their choice is to “betray” why they’re conservatives and move left or adopt a more authoritarian stance. Hence the “war on woke”, “longer sentences” etc. DeeplyDepressed The left haven’t learned to communicate in the way the right does. Rightwing views are based on looking at the world in the most simplistic way possible. The left tend to try to educate people instead of finding simple slogans and images that carry the messages they want to pass on. rockyrex It really does bear repeating to the majority it seems (pace Emmasdad), Corbyn-era policies would have sat comfortably within any Labour government until Thatcher, Liberals until the LibDem schism and the arrival of Clegg, and indeed to a few one-nation Tories. Corbyn was and is a left-of-centre democratic socialist, and utterly unremarkable in European terms. What IS remarkable is the bizarre lack of any wider view by those so indoctrinated or opinionated, to see him as “far left” or even “communist”.

1/23/2022,"The temperature is dropping to below zero in western Afghanistan and Delaram Rahmati is struggling to find food for her eight children. Since leaving the family home in the country’s Badghis province four years ago, the Rahmatis have been living in a mud hut with a plastic roof in one of Herat city’s slums. Drought made their village unliveable and the land unworkable. Like an estimated 3.5 million Afghans who have been forced to leave their homes, the Rahmatis now live in a neighbourhood for internally displaced people (IDP).  There are no jobs. But the 50-year-old has hospital fees to pay for two of her sons, one of whom is paralysed and the other who has mental illness, as well as medicine for her husband. “I was forced to sell two of my daughters, an eight- and six-year-old,” she says. Rahmati says she sold her daughters a few months ago for 100,000 afghani each (roughly £700), to families she doesn’t know. Her daughters will stay with her until they reach puberty and then be handed over to strangers. It is not uncommon in Afghanistan to arrange the sale of a daughter into a future marriage but raise her at home until it is time for her to leave. However, as the country’s economic crisis deepens, families are reporting that they are handing children over at an increasingly young age because they cannot afford to feed them. Yet, selling her daughters’ future was not the only agonising decision Rahmati was forced to make. “Because of debt and hunger I was forced to sell my kidney,” she tells Rukhshana Media from outside her home in the Herat slum. Afghanistan is on the brink of “a humanitarian crisis and economic collapse”, according to the UN. The agency’s ambassador to Afghanistan has said it is “experiencing the worst humanitarian crisis of its contemporary history”. Drought, Covid-19 and the economic sanctions imposed after the Taliban seized power in August 2021 have had catastrophic consequences on the economy. Dramatic rises in inflation have resulted in soaring food prices. The kidney trade has been growing in Afghanistan for some time. But since the Taliban took power, the price and conditions under which the illegal organ trade takes place has changed. The price of a kidney, which once ranged from $3,500 to $4,000 (£2,600 to £3,000), has dropped to less than $1,500 (£1,100). But the number of volunteers keeps rising. Rahmati sold her right kidney for 150,000 afghani (£1,000). But her recovery from the operation has not been good and now, like her husband, she is also sick, with no money left to visit a doctor. More than half of the country’s estimated 40 million population face “extreme levels of hunger, and nearly 9 million of them are at risk of famine”, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. For a growing number of Afghans, selling a kidney is their only way to get money to eat. “It has been months since we last ate rice. We hardly find bread and tea. Three nights a week, we can’t afford to eat dinner,” says Salahuddin Taheri, who lives in the same slum as the Rahmati family. Taheri, a 27-year-old father of four, who scrapes together enough money for five loaves of bread each day by collecting and selling recycled rubbish, is looking for a buyer for his kidney. “I have been asking private hospitals in Herat for many days if they need any kidney. I even told them if they need it urgently, I can sell it below the market price, but I haven’t heard back,” Taheri says. “I need to feed my children, I have no other choice.” In the past five years about 250 official kidney transplants have taken place in the hospitals in Herat province, with a very limited number being a family member donating their organ, says Asif Kabir, a public health official in the province. The cost of a kidney transplant is 400,000 afghani, plus the price of the kidney, according to Kabir. But the true number of kidney operations may be far higher. A doctor working in one of the hospitals where most of the transplants take place, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, says: “Recently the number of people who want to sell their kidney has increased in Herat and most of them live in the displaced camps, in Herat’s slums. The customers also go to the displaced camps to find a cheap kidney.” Sayed Ashraf Sadat, a civil society activist in Herat, was a member of a delegation assigned by president Ashraf Ghani to investigate the illegal kidney trade in May 2021. “We found that the hospitals were not working according to the law. People are working inside and outside the country to encourage people to sell their kidneys. These people get them visas and send them to the other side of the border. There is more demand for kidney transplants outside Afghanistan. Countries like Iran need kidneys, and poor Afghans are forced to sell them.” Sadat says the investigation he was part of identified two hospitals in Herat where kidney transplant operations take place; one of them said it had completed 194 operations and the other said 32, but more than 500 people were claiming to have sold their kidney, 100 from a single village in Herat. “This shows the kidneys were taken outside Afghanistan,” says Sadat. “For example, a kidney is purchased for 300,000 afghani (£2,100) inside Afghanistan, and it is sold for more than £7,500 to £11,000 outside the country,” says Sadat. “We found evidence that some are encouraged to sell their kidneys, taken outside the borders, and their kidneys are sold for 200,000 to 400,000 afghanis ,” says Sadat. “It seems that the doctors are involved in the illegal trade. But unfortunately, our investigation was stopped due to a worsening security situation.” Two months have passed since Rahmati’s kidney operation, and the money has already gone to pay off medical debt. Her recovery from the operation continues to go badly. “I am so sick. I couldn’t even walk because the wound has been infected. It is very painful,” she says, adding that the recipient of her kidney only paid for the operation fee, two nights in hospital and her first medicine bill. On the day of the transplant, Rahmati was sick and the doctors refused to operate. “I couldn’t breathe properly, so the doctors took me down from the hospital bed, but I returned. I told them ‘I am happy with my own death, but I can’t tolerate seeing my children hungry and ill’,” she says.

1/23/2022,"Britain’s sickest children are being treated in intensive care units that are struggling with severe shortages of the specialist nurses needed to look after them, a report says. The shortages in the UK’s 30 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) are so severe that healthcare assistants are covering the work of nurses in an attempt to ensure that staffing levels are maintained.  Only one of the PICUs – at the James Cook University hospital in Middlesbrough – was found to have enough nurses to guarantee the standards of care expected. About 15,000 children and young people a year, often with life-threatening conditions, are cared for in PICUs. Clinical standards that prevail in PICUs require them to ensure that seven nurses are on duty for each bed in a 24-hour cycle. However, the report by the Paediatric Intensive Care Audit Network (PICANet), a group of experts from Leicester and Leeds universities, found that 29 of the 30 had too few nurses to do that, and that all 30 had vacancies, sometimes large numbers of them. “Parents will find this extremely alarming”, said Patricia Marquis, the Royal College of Nursing’s England director. “Most people wouldn’t believe that only one paediatric intensive care unit across the whole UK has enough staff to function properly, but this is the reality of the workforce crisis. Key roles in specialist nursing teams are lying vacant for years.” The PICANet team identified nurses’ salaries and the cost of living in urban areas as key reasons. It found that three of the five hospitals with the lowest number of PICU nurses were in London: the Portland private hospital and Royal Brompton and Royal London NHS hospitals. Oxford’s John Radcliffe and Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Sick Children were the others. “The nursing shortage is crippling,” one paediatric intensive care doctor in London told the Guardian. “It means that we are routinely cancelling elective surgery that requires a PICU bed. Literally every single hospital in London with a PICU has had to do that recently.” The post-Brexit loss of PICU nurses from EU countries such as Spain and Portugal has exacerbated the situation. A leaked NHS memo about three London hospitals shows that on 12 December there were just nine nurses on duty to look after 12 children in the PICU at King’s College hospital, seven to care for 11 young people at St George’s hospital, and 19 to look after 18 patients at Evelina children’s hospital. “Clearly [the nurse-to-patient staffing] ratio isn’t being provided, so yes, kids are getting substandard care.” A second paediatric intensive care doctor said: “The shortage of PICU nurses is awful. Healthcare assistants can be very good. But their main strength is in soft skills stuff, like being a shoulder to cry on. But they can’t set up a renal haemodialysis machine or calibrate a ventilator for a child who is on oxygen, for example. Only a nurse can do that. “Units try to stretch a smaller number of nurses to look after more patients. You try to deliver the same level of care with a lower number of staff, which is a patient safety issue,” he added. Carli Whittaker, a nurse and the president-elect of the Paediatric Critical Care Society, said fewer PICUs were meeting staffing standards. Understaffing had led to an “erosion of morale” among PICU nurses and was affecting their emotional and psychological health, she added. But she welcomed PICANet’s finding that despite the widespread nurse shortage, the quality of care children and young people receive in PICUs had not been affected. The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",News/Society,Severe shortage of nurses in UK children’s intensive care units,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/23/childrens-intensive-care-units-uk-nurses-shortage
1/23/2022,"Between his pure shotmaking, his dynamic athleticism and the all-court style that ties his game together, there are few sights in men’s tennis as spectacular as Denis Shapovalov at the height of his powers. The question surrounding the Canadian and his future prospects has never been about his ability, but rather whether he can harness those talents and consistently replicate a high level on the biggest stages. On Sunday afternoon Shapovalov took a step forward in his progression as he produced statistically the best win of his young career by toppling Alexander Zverev, the third seed, 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. It was a notable performance not because of any delirious shotmaking, but rather the calm, disciplined manner in which he dismantled a top player.  In his press conference afterwards Shapovalov, 22, stressed his satisfaction about the patience and intelligence with which he played. His discipline was reflected in the statistics. While Shapovalov won only one more point than Zverev in nought-to-four-shot rallies, 66 to 65, he outscored Zverev by a combined 15 points in rallies played between five and eight shots and nine-plus shots. “It’s definitely something I’ve been learning to do,” he said of his patience. “Hasn’t come natural to me, unfortunately. I’ve always wanted to play quick and go for my shots. But it’s difficult when you play a guy with the calibre of Sascha [Zverev]. You can’t go through him in one or two shots. You have to stay in the rallies, you have to work for the points. Then when you have an opportunity you can swing in and go for it.” Shapovalov’s success in Australia is even more impressive considering the ordeal that preceded it. He was one of the players who tested positive for Covid-19 in December, his pre-season seemingly ruined. He emerged from quarantine and played in the ATP Cup shortly afterwards, joining forces with Félix Auger-Aliassime to win Canada’s first ever top-level team tournament. Shapovalov says he had picked up some niggles as a result of his unhelpful preparation and he did not practise much in the days before the Australian Open. Despite those obstacles, he is 7-0 in 2022. “Obviously every day is different,” he said. “But I feel with every match I have gained a little bit of confidence and comfort playing on these courts. I’m just pleased overall with my game so far and my fighting spirit. Yeah, just battling out in every single match. Hopefully I can continue going this way.” Across the net, it was a dire performance from Zverev, but it fitted into one of the most notable patterns in his career. Despite reaching the US Open final in 2020, he has never beaten a top-10 player at a grand slam tournament and he tends to struggle against top players in these events. Beating Shapovalov, ranked 14th, would have been the second best grand slam win of his career by ranking. Instead, he did not come close. Zverev is still under investigation by the ATP after his ex-girlfriend, Olya Sharypova, alleged that he was physically and emotionally abusive to her. Zverev denies the allegations. With Zverev’s loss, the implications for the men’s draw are also significant. Zverev was the second favourite to win the tournament, meaning Daniil Medvedev is now an even heavier favourite. Shapovalov now faces the unenviable task of playing against the new second favourite, Rafael Nadal, in the quarter-final. Nadal advanced to the quarter-final in straight sets, but only after enduring some genuine tension early on. His manic first-set tiebreak against Adrian Mannarino turned into one the moments of the first week as they ended up duelling for 28 minutes. Mannarino saved six match points, mostly with supreme shotmaking, while Nadal saved four set points himself. The tiebreak ended with an appropriately absurd final point, at 15-14 to Nadal. Mannarino was in complete control but he tried to finish the point by attacking a forehand behind Nadal. Nadal had held his ground and he reflexively responded with a winning drive volley to snatch the set. Nadal eventually won 7-6 (14), 6-2, 6-2. “It is a victory with a lot of value, and especially the first set, a lot of value, so very happy for that,” said Nadal. “I was able to resist the tough moments in the first set. So, yeah, is a very important victory for me.”",Sport/Sport,Denis Shapovalov hits heights to topple Alexander Zverev in Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/denis-shapovalov-beats-alexander-zverev-australian-open-tennis
1/23/2022,"John Lewis has told staff they will get full sick pay regardless of their Covid vaccination status, saying that it doesn’t “believe it’s right” to treat jabbed and unjabbed workers differently. The retailer’s high-street rivals including Next, Ikea and Ocado are among the companies that have introduced sickness policies that differentiate between vaccinated and unvaccinated employees who have to self-isolate.  However in a blogpost on LinkedIn, John Lewis’s group operations director, Andrew Murphy, told its 70,000-strong workforce: “We’re not going to make any change of this type.” He added: “We just don’t believe it’s right to create a link between a partner’s vaccination status and the pay they receive.” He said the company – which is owned by its employees, called partners, who receive an annual profit share – was “hugely supportive of the UK vaccination programme” and had given staff time off to get their jabs. “We cast no judgment on the decisions of any other organisation; in fact we’ve enjoyed how united businesses – retailers especially – have been in the face of these huge corporate and societal challenges,” Murphy said. “However, when life increasingly seems to present opportunities to create division – and with hopes rising that the pandemic phase of Covid may be coming to an end – we’re confident that this is the right approach for us.” Current rules in all UK nations now make a clear distinction in self-isolation requirements for vaccinated and unvaccinated people if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid. In all four nations the unvaccinated must self-isolate for 10 days even if they do not test positive for the virus. This requirement does not apply for people who are fully vaccinated. Unvaccinated workers at Next and Ikea are only eligible for statutory sick pay – which is set at £96.35 a week – during their 10 days of isolation, unless there are mitigating circumstances. This compares with weekly pay of more than £400 before tax for an average store worker at Ikea. The supermarket chain Morrisons announced in September that it was cutting sick pay during self-isolation for its unvaccinated workers, as part of a move to cut its pandemic-related costs.",News/Business,John Lewis will pay full sick pay regardless of Covid vaccination status,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/23/john-lewis-sick-pay-covid-vaccination-status
