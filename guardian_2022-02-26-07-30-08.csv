2/26/2022,"With his team huddled around him in the dressing room of Cardiff’s National Stadium, Wales’ captain Phil Bennett delivered a speech that has gone down in rugby folklore. Stoking the fires of Welsh pride and pressing the pressure point of national insecurity, he called on his fellow patriots to perform their civic duty and teach their better resourced neighbours a lesson. This rousing call worked. With their blood sufficiently heated, Wales won the match – contested on 5 March 1977 – 14-9. On Saturday, another captain wearing a red jersey with 10 on his back will be tasked with motivating his charges before facing their fiercest foes. “Sometimes very little is needed to be said,” said Dan Biggar, downplaying the importance of a pre-planned speech. “It’s very much down to the individual. I’d like to think that in a pivotal weekend in the Six Nations against England at Twickenham there won’t be too much needed said from an emotional level to get us going.” Biggar, who lives in England and plays club rugby with Northampton, was cautious about using the same belligerent language as his predecessor Bennett. Even though he sought to dampen the jingoism he conceded that this game is one that Welsh fans most look forward to when the fixtures are released. For them, the significance of beating England transcends log positions and the context of the Six Nations Championship. But beating England and beating England at Twickenham are two different prospects. Wales have not won there since the momentous 2015 World Cup group match when Biggar’s late penalty was the difference. In four of their five subsequent defeats, a worrying pattern has emerged. In the 2016 Six Nations, Antony Watson’s 30th-minute converted try opened a 16-0 lead for England. In 2018 all 12 of England’s points were scored by the 20th minute with Wales only managing six from the remaining hour. In a World Cup warm-up match in 2019 England scored 14 unanswered points in as many minutes. In the 2020 Championship, Watson’s fourth minute try meant Wales were chasing the game before their heart rates were up. When Bundee Aki dotted down after just three minutes in the 29-7 defeat in Dublin, Wales’ leadership group began to wonder if this was a systemic problem within the camp. To their credit, Biggar’s team rallied and beat a more fancied Scottish outfit a week later. Both the captain and his coach Wayne Pivac have credited a frothing Principality crowd for lifting their performance but Biggar insists that the onus is on them to rise for the occasion no matter the venue. “We need to make sure that when we go away to tough places, like the Aviva, like Twickenham, we start well,” Biggar said. “It’s important we don’t give them a start. It’s such a difficult task. Even if you get yourself back in the game, one more score for England takes you out. They’ve got some serious strength in depth and they’re a very good side.” England’s selection of Harry Randall at scrum-half has not gone unnoticed and Biggar believes this is a clear warning that Eddie Jones intends on playing a high tempo game. Not that Wales will mind that. They too will be looking to keep the ball in hand. When Biggar is in possession and is forced to kick he will more often than not look to avoid touch, starving England’s powerful maul the opportunity to rumble up field. The reintroduction of Taulupe Faletau, playing his first Test in six months after sustaining an ankle injury with the British and Irish Lions in South Africa, will encourage Wales’ attacking strategy. “Toby is world class,” his skipper said. “It’s great to have him back. To have a bit more muscle but also that ball playing ability that he brings.” Manu Tuilagi’s injury doesn’t swing the pendulum entirely in Wales’ favour but his absence will further embolden the visitors who must now feel that they’re closer to parity in the collision. But this is an area of the game that isn’t necessarily won by the bigger or faster man. Character counts as much stature. “At some point you have to roll your sleeves up,” Biggar said, referencing the spirit his team showed in 2015 to overturn a 19-9 deficit. “Gethin Jenkins spoke really well at half-time [against Scotland]. He asked what sort of feeling do we want in the dressing room when we come back in. Do we want to be enjoying a beer after putting everything in and enjoying the result? Or do we want to feel that we haven’t given it our all and are really quite disappointed with how we played and let the country down?” Biggar may try to convince you that this is just another rugby match. Don’t believe a word of it.",Sport/Sport,‘You have to roll your sleeves up’: Biggar says character counts against England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/wales-england-six-nations-dan-biggar-twickenham
2/26/2022,"England have insisted that Manu Tuilagi was “managed appropriately” on his return to the national setup despite being ruled out of Saturday’s Six Nations clash against Wales with a hamstring injury. Tuilagi sustained the new injury – a low grade hamstring tear – in training on Thursday just hours after he had been named to make his first Six Nations start in two years. In November Tuilagi suffered an injury to the same hamstring in the act of scoring the opening try in the thrilling autumn victory over South Africa. The 30-year-old made his comeback off the bench for Sale against Harlequins in early February with an impressive 29-minute cameo, after which the Sharks director of rugby, Alex Sanderson, said he would prefer Tuilagi had a couple more games at the club to build up his match fitness. He played 52 minutes the following weekend – scoring a try against Worcester – before joining up with England at the start of last week. “Both strength and conditioning and medical teams liaise closely about all players, all players are managed appropriately with what is required, that is no different for Manu’s situation than any other player,” said England’s forwards coach, Richard Cockerill. “[There’s] disappointment for him, he has worked very hard on his conditioning, he is in really good shape, the shape of his life. These little niggles are frustrating but he is a good man, he has matured and he has a good outlook on life.” England are confident that Tuilagi will be back playing before the end of the Six Nations and believe they can keep their championship title bid on track without him against Wales. Eddie Jones was not due to confirm who will replace Tuilagi in the starting lineup until England arrive at Twickenham on Saturday with Henry Slade expected to move to inside-centre and Elliot Daly or Joe Marchant coming in to the No 13 jersey. Cockerill added: “I am sure he will come back as good as ever. He works very hard at his game but that is the game sometimes, you get injuries, you work through them and he has worked through a fair few injuries in his career. I have no doubt he will come back and be fresh and playing well for club and country very soon. “If we want to have any opportunity to win the championship we need to win all three games. That starts against Wales. It’s an important game for Wales and ourselves. We know we have to win and to win we will have to play very well. Wales clearly have a lot of very good players, they work very hard for each other and if you give them an opportunity they will take it. “We are treating them with huge respect. We know they will bring their A game to Twickenham and we’ve got to do the same.”",Sport/Sport,England say Manu Tuilagi was ‘managed appropriately’ despite injury setback,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/england-say-manu-tuilagi-was-managed-appropriately-despite-injury-setback
2/26/2022,"If part of the joy of the Six Nations is the glorious unpredictability of it all, for France there is an uneasy sense of déjà vu about what lies ahead at Murrayfield on Saturday afternoon. Les Bleus lorded it over Scotland with only one defeat in the first 16 years of the expanded Championship, but 2016 proved something of a watershed in relations for the Auld Alliance, with the Scots having won four of the last six tournament encounters, including the last three in Edinburgh. Recent history has not stopped thousands of buoyant French supporters descending on the Scottish capital after opening victories over Italy and Ireland, but there are reasons for caution in Tricolore ranks. Gregor Townsend’s side derailed the last French grand slam bandwagon two years ago, and memories of Scotland’s stunning 27-23 triumph in Paris at the end of last year’s championship are still painfully fresh. A third successive Championship victory over the French for the first time since 1958 would reignite hopes of a top-two finish for Stuart Hogg and company, with Italy in Rome next and the prospect of heading to Dublin on the final day with an outside shot at the title themselves. So much for the tartan-tinted view. The pessimists argue, with some justification, that the Scots’ defeat in Cardiff a fortnight ago exposed a familiar failing when burdened with heightened expectations. Then factor in that the French appear to have kicked on apace over the past year, adding greater power, defensive resolve, speed and consistency to their game to the extent that Townsend rates them as “arguably the best team in the world” on current form. There remains an intriguing psychological dynamic to this fixture, though. France may have blown New Zealand away last autumn and bludgeoned a confident Ireland to defeat last time out, but they have not found the Scots to be so accommodating when something tangible is on the line. In 2020 France lost fly-half Romain Ntamack to an early injury, flanker François Cros to a yellow card and had prop Mohamed Haouas sent off for a swinging punch at Jamie Ritchie all before half-time. Scotland ruthlessly exploited their numerical advantage to inflict the heaviest defeat – 28-17 – of Fabien Galthié’s reign at a raucous Murrayfield. “They are a team who pose us problems and we are aware of the level we need to be at in all areas to compete,” said the head coach. “Murrayfield is always extraordinary but we learned a lot from that match. We have prepared ourselves accordingly – physically, tactically and psychologically.” The visitors have the stardust of Antoine Dupont and Ntamack to sprinkle on proceedings but they also have their fair share of brute force inside and outside their half-back duo for a match Galthié believes will be decided by “physical domination”. The formidably strong Jonathan Danty is back at centre alongside Gaël Fickou and Galthié has moved Yoram Moefana from midfield to replace the injured Gabin Villière on the wing, ostensibly to counteract Scotland’s “very fast, very powerful” three-quarters, notably wings Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe who Galthié believes are “walking on water at the moment”. Scotland have scored a couple of tasty multi-phase tries against England and Wales but their attack has only spluttered fitfully so far. With a dry forecast, Hogg believes that could change. “Hopefully if we get the pictures we have seen from the French defence, there are huge opportunities for us with ball in hand,” he said. “I have no doubt if we carry hard, move them around and find space, our attack will really get going.” Scotland Hogg (capt); Graham, Harris, Tuipulotu, Van der Merwe; Russell, Price; Schoeman, McInally, Z Fagerson, Skinner, Gilchrist, Haining, Darge, BradburyReplacements Turner, Kebble, Nel, Hodgson, Christie, White, Kinghorn, Bennett France Jaminet; Penaud, Fickou, Danty, Moefana; Ntamack, Dupont; Baille, Marchand, Atonio, Woki, Willemse, Cros, Jelonch, AlldrittReplacements Mauvaka, Gros, Bamba, Taofifenua, Flament, Cretin, Lucu, Ramos - Key to that vision, as always, will be Finn Russell, who Hogg praised for the “outstanding” analysis he has provided on opponents he plays with and against in the Top 14 for Racing 92. “Finn has been absolute quality and is getting really excited about the opportunities in attack and driving the way we want to play,” Hogg said. “I’ve no doubt he will execute everything he wants to do to get us moving forward.” Scotland’s back-row resources have been further depleted with Matt Fagerson joining Jamie Ritchie on the sidelines and Sam Skinner switching to lock. Townsend was dealt a further blow on Friday evening when flanker Hamish Watson was forced out of the starting XV after testing positive for Covid. That, in turn, has led to Edinburgh’s Nick Haining coming in to the team to play on the blindside, with Rory Darge moving to openside flanker. Saracens’ Andy Christie also comes into the matchday squad and the 22-year-old would make what would be his Scotland debut were he to be called on to feature from the replacements. Two members of the Scotland backroom team have also tested positive for Covid and will isolate as per Scottish government guidelines. The Scots, as Skinner noted this week, are in “do or die” mode. If the French have the heavy artillery and genius of Dupont to prevail in a tight contest, it would not be a major surprise if the hosts live to fight another day in their quest to become Championship contenders.

2/26/2022,"If a mini mid-winter revival under Dean Smith offered Norwich City faint hope, this defeat saw them revert to type. On this evidence, the remainder of the season promises to be a slog and it would have been a travesty had Southampton only came away with a slender victory. Just as it seemed Ralph Hasenhüttl’s side would have to settle for what would have been tantamount to a one-nil battering, the midfielder Oriol Romeu smacked in a wonderful effort from the edge of the box with a couple of minutes to spare, building on Che Adams’s first-half strike. Southampton, who have lost just once at home all season, are keeping good company in the top half. Eventually Southampton’s relentless pressure told. They huffed and puffed and then blew a creaking Norwich structure down. The home support were able to afford a communal chuckle at the slapstick manner of Adams’s 36th-minute strike but it made painful viewing from a Norwich perspective. Brandon Williams, who struggled at left-back, made a sliding intervention but inadvertently gifted the ball to the swarming Tino Livramento and the teenager sent a low cross into the six-yard box. Angus Gunn, the Norwich goalkeeper whose last Premier League game at this ground was for Southampton in the infamous 9-0 defeat to Leicester, skewered the ball with his right boot and it bounced off Max Aarons and to Adams. The Southampton striker made a mess of applying the finishing touch, swiping at thin air the first time around before finally scooping the ball over the line and setting off towards the corner in celebration. Gunn endured a testing spell at St Mary’s and this was also the scene of Smith’s final game in charge of Aston Villa in November. Smith was encouraged by Norwich’s performance in defeats to Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks, so much so he named an unchanged starting lineup, but there was little evidence of any progress here as Southampton dictated the pace from the off. Gunn repelled a volley from Mohamed Elyounoussi after Armando Broja flicked on a devilish first-time cross by James Ward-Prowse, who put in another peerless performance in midfield, and saved instinctively after a Stuart Armstrong shot pinballed awkwardly towards him. Smith stewed in the away technical area. Williams found the going tough against the roaming Livramento, allowing the full-back to earn Southampton an early corner after selling the subdued Milot Rashica short with a simple pass. Williams overcooked a simple pass into Mathias Normann and presented Broja with a sight of goal, but the striker dribbled his shot at Gunn. Rashica was twice brushed off easily by Southampton shirts and while Southampton overpowered Norwich, the visitors carved a couple of first-half chances. Livramento blocked from Josh Sargent after Teemu Pukki turned Jan Bednarek near the byline and Billy Gilmour sent the rebound wide. If the Norwich supporters felt short-changed by their team’s first-half display, they could at least enjoy the half-time entertainment, as a football freestyler exhibited his skills on the touchline. Norwich came into this game with 16 league defeats from their first 25 top-flight games this season and only three teams in Premier League history have wriggled clear of relegation with those numbers, including Southampton in 1994. Norwich never looked like averting a 17th loss, with Southampton maintaining the heat in the second half. Armstrong slipped in Broja, played onside by Williams, but the Norwich defender Ben Gibson cut out his cross. Adams went close from the resulting corner, but a leaping Williams did enough. Pukki enjoyed the odd foray upfield – Kenny McLean skied a shot after the striker cut the ball back to the edge of the box – but he was a one-man band and his frustration caught up with him when he tugged at Livramento’s shirt. On the opposite flank Norwich could not live with the again brilliant Kyle Walker-Peters. It seemed a matter of when and not if a dominant Southampton would double their advantage. Gunn kept out another Armstrong shot, and a volley by Walker-Peters with 20 minutes to play. Armstrong then flashed another shot wide. Gunn, whose father, Bryan, was in the stands, l ooked at the yellow shirts before him aghast. Southampton were stupidly comfortable and when Norwich did locate Rashica with a through pass Mohammed Salisu switched on the afterburners to steal the ball. Norwich roused now and then – Salisu stood his ground when Pukki swivelled neatly in the box with 15 minutes to play and Grant Hanley glanced wide unmarked to Smith’s pain – but with the final whistle approaching Romeu leathered in from the edge of the box.",Sport/Football,Romeu screamer puts seal on Southampton’s defeat of Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/southampton-norwich-premier-league-match-report
