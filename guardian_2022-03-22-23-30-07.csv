3/22/2022,"Journalists should be provided with access to documents from employment tribunal cases even in the aftermath of a judgment, it has been ruled, after a successful legal challenge by the Guardian. In a significant victory for open justice, the employment appeal tribunal threw out a ruling from a lower court that the costs of transparency would be too burdensome, and instead ordered that the Guardian should be provided with documents it had requested. The judge suggested the documents should be released at no cost. The ruling builds on a series of recent judgments enhancing the rights of journalists to access documents placed before the court, particularly where they demonstrate that they are acting in the public interest. “The press have an important role in reporting the judgments of courts and tribunals,” the judge, James Tayler, ruled. “It is in the public interest that they have the necessary information to be able to do so fairly and accurately.” The case relates to an application by the Guardian journalist David Pegg, in 2018, for documents referred to in the public judgment of an employment tribunal case. The case involved Dmitri Rozanov, an employee of the London branch of EFG, a Swiss bank, which he claimed had unfairly sacked him. Rozanov argued he was sacked after raising concerns about EFG’s compliance with anti-money-laundering practices and its facilitation of a $100m transaction for a client allegedly connected to the Chechen despot Ramzan Kadyrov. The tribunal concluded that the matters Rozanov had raised did constitute protected disclosures in law. However, it found that EFG had sacked him for reasons other than his protected disclosures. The Guardian subsequently wrote to the tribunal requesting copies of documents mentioned in the Rozanov judgment, including emails in which it appeared that serious deficiencies in EFG’s anti-money-laundering practices had been alleged. However, Judge Lewis of the employment tribunal refused the Guardian’s application, claiming that the reasons cited by the newspaper were insufficient to engage the open justice principle, and that the costs of locating and scanning the documents requested would be too burdensome. The Guardian appealed against Lewis’s ruling, and in a decision released on Tuesday, Tayler reversed the lower tribunal’s decision and ordered EFG to hand over the documents. Tayler criticised Lewis’s suggestion that giving journalists access to tribunal documents would be too expensive, describing its complaint that this would require locating and scanning paper copies of documents as “a picture of a solicitors’ office of the 70s”. “The decision of the employment tribunal to give more weight to the possible minor inconvenience in providing the documents than to the principle of open justice means that the determination reached by the employment tribunal was wrong,” he wrote. “If necessary I would say plainly wrong, and go so far as to find it was perverse in the sense of it being a decision that no reasonable tribunal could have reached in the circumstances of this case on a proper direction of law.” Tayler said digital trial bundles had become increasingly ubiquitous in the legal system, particularly since the coronavirus pandemic, and that as a result there was likely to be no effective administrative cost in providing electronic copies of documents to journalists. He also ruled there was no time limit on an application for documents, and that journalists were entitled to inspect materials relevant to a tribunal judgment even after a case had concluded. The judge said the Guardian’s application to the lower tribunal had established “journalistic” reasons for accessing the documents, such as ensuring that any subsequent article was as accurate as possible, and also underlying subject matter of public interest, specifically EFG bank’s anti-money-laundering procedures. “Far from this being a case in which the principle of open justice was not strongly engaged, the converse was the case,” Tayler wrote. “GNM set out proper journalistic reasons for seeking provision of the documentation. The public interest in the underlying subject matter of the proceedings was something that should also have weighed in favour of granting the application.” The Guardian was represented by the barristers Greg Callus and Ben Hamer of 5RB. Katharine Viner, the editor-in-chief of the Guardian, said: “This is a significant judgment in favour of open justice and emphasises the importance of allowing journalists to see documents referred to in employment tribunals.” She added: “The ruling is a welcome signal that open justice and public interest journalism can and must go hand in hand.” The EFG bank has submitted an appeal to challenge part of the judge’s ruling as it argues that a set of documents should not be released, while it accepts that the Guardian should be given copies of two other sets of documents.",News/Law,Guardian wins legal challenge over access to employment tribunal papers,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/22/guardian-wins-legal-challenge-access-employment-tribunal
3/22/2022,"The European Union aims to establish a “trust fund” for Ukraine while it battles Russia’s invasion and rebuilds afterwards, as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told Italy’s parliament his people were clinging to survival. Leaders from the 27-nation bloc will gather in Brussels on Thursday to discuss its response to Moscow’s onslaught on Ukraine, including a longer-term financial support mechanism beyond the €1.2bn in emergency funding already agreed. According to a draft document seen by Agence-France Presse, the EU will commit to “provide support to the Ukrainian government for its immediate needs and, once the Russian onslaught has ceased, for the reconstruction of a democratic Ukraine”. The document did not provide details on the size of the Ukraine solidarity trust fund or how it might work, but said the European council expected preparations to start “without delay” and would call an international conference to raise cash. The US president, Joe Biden, is also due to travel to Brussels this week for Nato and G7 talks to discuss further action, including tighter sanctions on Russia. Biden discussed Moscow’s “brutal” tactics in a call with European leaders on Monday. Addressing the Italian parliament in Rome, Zelenskiy said that for Russian forces, “Ukraine is the gates of Europe, where they want to break in, but barbarism must not be allowed to pass.” He again called for more help to deafeat his country’s invaders. Zelenskiy warned that one potential consequence of the war was “famine that is approaching for some countries”. Ukraine had “always been one of the largest food exporters”, he said, “but how can we sow crops under the strikes of Russian artillery?” In an interview with European broadcasters late on Monday, Zelenskiy said an end to the war would only be negotiated if he met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, and repeated his acknowledgement that Ukraine could not now secure Nato membership. Responding to the Ukrainian leader, Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, said Ukraine had offered “heroic” resistance to the invading Russian forces and Italy would support its bid to join the EU, which Kyiv has long said it wants to do. Draghi said EU accession was a lengthy process because of the reforms needed to integrate fully with the bloc, but added: “I want to say to President Zelenskiy that Italy is at Ukraine’s side in this process. Italy wants Ukraine in the EU.” The EU has collectively imposed several rounds of sanctions on Moscow and agreed €1bn in financing for weapons for Ukraine’s military, but cracks are beginning to appear in the bloc’s unity over further measures, including a ban on Russia’s key energy exports. Combined western sanctions have cut Russia out of most international trade to a degree never imposed on such a large economy, but exceptions have been been carved out for Russian energy exports to Europe, its biggest oil and gas customer. Several member states insist they still rely too heavily on Russian gas and oil to be able halt all energy imports immediately. In an effort to cut EU consumption of Russian gas, leaders are also set to agree at this week’s Brussels summit to collectively buy gas, LNG and hydrogen elsewhere. “With a view to next winter, member states and the commission will urgently … work together on the joint purchase” of key energy products, a draft statement seen by Reuters reads. More ways will also be sought to shield consumers from rising prices.",News/World news,EU aims to set up ‘trust fund’ for reconstruction of democratic Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/eu-aims-to-set-up-trust-fund-for-reconstruction-of-democratic-ukraine
3/22/2022,"One Sunday morning in January, Pablo Isabel Hernández set off to walk to church in San Marcos de Caiquín, a remote part of Honduras, but never arrived. One of Hernández’s brothers, who followed later, found Pablo, 33, dead on the road. He had been shot in the back. The next day, as Thalía Rodríguez, 46, lay in bed with her partner 500 miles (800km) away in the capital, Tegucigalpa, masked armed men stormed into her flat and shot her in the head. These two individuals lived far apart from each other, and seemingly with nothing in common, yet one aspect of their lives linked them: both were defending human rights in their community. They were not the only human rights defenders to die that month. On 22 January, Melvin Geovany Mejía, an indigenous rights defender, died on his way to hospital after being shot in Morazán, about 400 miles north of the capital. Isabel Albaladejo, representative of the Office of the UNHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Honduras, believes that three killings in less than a month shows how it has become an increasingly hostile environment for human rights defenders in the country. “The situation is getting worse,” she says. “Without doubt, Honduras is a very dangerous country for the defence of human rights.” In 2021, the OHCHR recorded 302 attacks against human rights defenders (209 defenders and 93 journalists). Of those, 10 were murdered. In 2018, Michel Forst, the UN special rapporteur, called Honduras one of the most dangerous countries for human rights defenders in Latin America. Four years on, the outlook is still bleak. Albaladejo says: “One thing particular to Honduras is the use of the penal law against those who defend human rights, in addition to lack of judicial independence.” In October 2021, the national congress of Honduras passed a series of reforms to the penal code that carry prison terms for protests, for example. On 9 January, six human rights defenders from the community of Guapinol, who opposed an open-cast iron-oxide mine that threatened the community’s water sources, such as the Guapinol River, were found guilty of the crimes of illegal deprivation of liberty and aggravated damages against the contractor of the company Inversiones Los Pinares, to widespread indignation from human rights groups. Conflicts between companies and communities over land contribute to the dire situation as does a lack of investigation and adequate punishment for crimes, say environmental and land defenders, who believe impunity reigns. All of this is exacerbated by huge socioeconomic inequalities, Albaladejo adds. In July last year, Roberto David Castillo – former head of the dam company Desarrollos Energéticos – was found guilty over the killing of the indigenous environmentalist leader Berta Cáceres. The government’s mechanism for the protection of journalists, human rights defenders and operators of justice, created in 2015, lacks uniform criteria and is ineffective, says Human Rights Watch. According to Albaladejo, prosecutors have only formally laid charges in one case out of the 236 complaints they received between March 2018 and October 2021. The cases of 19 defenders murdered between 2020 and 2021 remain unsolved, she says. “It’s difficult to talk about the hardships that human rights defenders face in Honduras,” says Berta Oliva, founder of Cofadeh, an organisation helping the relatives of disappeared people in the country, who worked with Pablo Hernández. “I try to energise myself with good vibes and think that I’m working for the common good, that there isn’t a dark force that can stop the light. But this is an ideal,” says Oliva. “Our reality is something else. The reality is the murders of Pablo and Thalía in one week.” Hernández’s brother, Alejandro, remembers him as sociable and always smiling. He loved teaching his children to sing and dreamed of being able to give them an education so they could enter a profession – something he did not have the opportunity to do. He leaves behind a wife and four children. He belonged to the Lenca indigenous people, was heavily involved with the church and was a member of a network of human rights defenders. Hernández often appeared on Radio Tenán, a community station that regularly reported on corruption and questioned the local administration of San Marcos de Caiquín. The news of his death did not come as a shock to Alejandro. Hernández had received death threats in March 2020. “Pablo told me he had been threatened and that he was well prepared – through his work in the church – for anything that should happen,” he says. “He believed he had to keep working. When he spoke on the radio, he wasn’t scared. He was aware of what might happen and even I had prepared myself for [his death].” Hernandez’s murder is under investigation and his body was exhumed on 16 February for forensic analysis by the public prosecutor’s office. Those who defend LGBTQ+ rights are also in a vulnerable position in Honduras. Thalia Rodríguez was a transgender rights defender and heavily involved in advocating for people with HIV. The police arrested a member of MS-13, one of the most notorious gangs in Honduras, over her murder, but he has been released because of a lack of evidence. Sandra Patargo, protection coordinator for the Americas at Frontline Defenders, says: “We have been documenting increased violence against trans defenders in the country and many of them are leaving because they’re not finding sustainable solutions.” Cattrachas, a Honduran advocacy organisation that documents violence against LGBTQ+ people in Honduras, says 125 transgender people have been murdered since 2009. In the past three years, six transgender rights defenders have died, including Bessy Ferrera who was shot in July 2019 on the streets of Comayagüela, close to the capital. The OHCHR, meanwhile, recorded seven transgender rights defenders as victims of attacks in 2021. Astrid Ramos, a lawyer at Cattrachas, and her colleague Nahil Zerón remember Rodríguez as someone who was always willing to help anyone in need. “Whenever she talked about trans rights, she always thought about how things could be better for generations to come,” says Ramos. “She was fearless, strong, brave. She loved life, dancing, singing, karaoke. She loved the beach, and the sea. She loved to cook for her friends.” Rihanna Ferrera, a close friend of Rodríguez and also a trans activist, feels pain and worry at the loss of another colleague. She visited Rodríguez’s home weeks before she died and neighbours told her Rodríguez had been threatened and attacked. Ferrera credits Rodríguez with being “a great leader” of the transgender movement. She remembers: “Thalía always used to tell me: ‘I’m like a phoenix rising from the ashes.’ She said that we had to continue to raise our voices to eradicate discrimination and to make sure that [our human rights] and our gender are recognised.” Ferrera, and other activists, have some hope that the arrival of a new government, led by a female president, may bring much needed change in Honduras. Xiomara Castro, of the centre-left Libre party, has promised to fight corruption, crime and poverty, as well as improve conditions for women. “The new government has announced publicly that it wishes to create a safe and favourable environment for the work of human rights defenders,” says Albaladejo. “I believe this is an important first step.”",News/Global development,‘Two murders in a week’: Honduran activists risk death to defend rights,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/22/two-murders-in-a-week-honduran-activists-risk-death-to-defend-rights
3/22/2022,"I’m vegetarian but my friends aren’t. What meat-free dinner party mains sit well alongside meat or fish?Amy, London SW9 “I try to make one big dish that’s complete in itself, like a turbo-charged potato salad,” says Joe Woodhouse, whose debut cookbook Your Daily Veg is out this month. You could add capers, chopped cornichons, “double up on onion” with chopped red and spring onion, lemon zest and juice, parsley, and dill, then finish with green goddess dressing (soft herbs blitzed with yoghurt, vinegar and lemon juice). Don’t be beholden to rules, though: “If you like something, go big on it.” Spoon some harissa over it, top with grilled, seasonal veg, and pop a pork chop on the side for meat eaters. Other spuds you’ll like can be roasted and eaten with mayonnaise, says Chantelle Nicholson, chef-founder of Apricity, which opens in London this spring. “Blend wild garlic with oil, then use that to make a mayonnaise with egg or aquafaba.” Make a meal of it by frying or roasting purple sprouting broccoli in sesame oil, then top with salsa verde or zhoug and sesame seeds. Nicholson bulks things out with cooked emmer wheat or spelt dressed with white-wine vinegar, sesame or olive oil and chopped parsley, dill and/or tarragon. Leeks, both creamed or chargrilled, make a fine addition, too, plus whatever protein your friends fancy (Nicholson recommends fried tofu for you, Amy). When Tom Barnes, executive chef of L’Enclume and Rogan & Co in Cumbria, was on Great British Menu, he was tasked with the fish course, as well as a vegetarian alternative. The answer? Carrots. “We baked them in foil until soft, marinated them overnight in shio koji [a sweet, miso-like Japanese cure], then served them warm with dried seaweed.” The texture, he says, is akin to smoked salmon, so fish eaters could have the two together. Mushrooms are also magic. Barnes fries king oysters, then brushes them with miso. “Serve with shallot puree, potatoes fried in butter and a sauce made with mushroom stock.” Saute mushrooms with onions, thyme and garlic, cover with water and simmer. “Fry more shallots and garlic, add red wine and reduce. Add the stock and finish with butter.” Just add roast beef for your mates, Amy. Roasted whole veg makes a cracking centrepiece, too. Nicholson is partial to onions stuffed with breadcrumbs and wild garlic butter, which play nicely with most meat. Woodhouse recalls a fancy kebab meal he recently made for friends: “Various salads, flatbreads and marinated boned lamb shoulder, which I thinly sliced.” The latter ended up as the support act: “People said they didn’t need the meat.” The thing is, though, Amy, your friends won’t keel over without meat, so why not make life easy and stick solely to vegetarian fare? Woodhouse suggests concentrating instead on making “delicious, interesting things”. Mastery of a few dressings will help: tahini with yoghurt, garlic and lemon, say, or a “balancing act between olive oil, grated garlic, lemon juice, chopped chilli and chopped herb stalks”. He grills steamed cabbage wedges, drizzles them in tahini, then spoons the lemony oil on top, or he tosses sliced, raw cabbage in the same dressing to “dump on brothy beans”. Any friend worth their salt couldn’t possibly resist that. Got a culinary dilemma?

3/22/2022,"The wife of the Ukrainian president, Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, and other leaders’ wives for helping to ensure sick children reached safety. And she paid tribute to Europeans who have been housing and helping Ukrainian refugees, saying they deserved a Nobel peace prize. Writing to Le Parisien newspaper, Olena Zelenska, 44, said that when Russia began attacking Ukraine she had issued an appeal for the support of the world’s first ladies. Brigitte Macron was one of the first to respond, she added, and their relationship was “warm and friendly”. “My appeal was heard,” Zelenska said. “I want to thank all Europeans who are now helping our people, giving them homes, feeding them, encouraging them … like us, you weren’t prepared for having so many traumatised people in your country. But the way you have reacted is worth of a collective Nobel Peace prize. Ukrainians are marvellous people and very grateful. Our children will never forget what you have done for us.” She also spoke of her admiration for her husband’s courage. “Do I admire this man? Every single day. Am I surprised? No. Volodymyr has always been like this: determined and calm. In a time of war, all Ukrainians and the whole world have clearly seen the principles he holds and have felt the strength in him. He will never abandon what is in Ukraine’s interest.” After Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Zelenska wrote on Instagram: “I won’t panic or cry. I will be calm and confident.” She admitted this had since become impossible. “There are tears when I see the victims, the dead children, the families gunned down or buried under the rubble of their own homes. I can’t help myself. But there’s no panic. Panic comes when you don’t know what to do. Me, I know perfectly well what we must do and the Ukrainian people know too. Our plan is to protect Ukrainians and win.” She said that calling family members to see if they were still alive was a “daily ritual” for Ukrainians. “You verify your messages, if they are marked as read there’s still hope that they’ve still some network connection and they’re still alive and that’s already incredibly happy news during a war. “It is terrifying to read posts on social networks where Ukrainians are looking in vain for their family members who have disappeared. We need real safe humanitarian corridors that are not targeted by mortars, where the elderly are not dying of heart attacks, and in which entire families are being killed.” Zelenska has been working with Brigitte Macron and Agata Kornhauser-Duda, who is married to Poland’s president, to evacuate sick Ukrainian children, particularly those needing life-saving treatment for cancer. “These ‘life convoys’ are unprecedented. When it became obvious it was impossible to treat children with cancer in bomb shelters we immediately looked for a solution. Some [children] will stay in Poland, others will be sent on to France, Italy, Germany, the United States and Canada. I’m happy that I was of use in this process. In particular I’m happy that with the agreement of Mrs Macron we could send our little patients to France.” Le Parisien said Zelenska was still in Kyiv but at an unspecified location for her own safety, having been identified as the Russians’ main target after her husband. Asked what the role of women is in the war, she replied: “Our resistance, as our future victory, has taken on a particularly feminine face. Women are fighting in the army, they are signed up to territorial defence [units], they are the foundation of a powerful volunteer movement to supply, deliver, feed … they give birth in shelters, save their children and look after others’ children, they keep the economy going, they go abroad to seek help. Others are simply doing their jobs, in hospitals, pharmacies, shops, transport, public services … so that life continues.” Zelenska said she had “nothing to say” to Russians who supported Vladimir Putin’s attack on her country but wanted to send a message to the mothers of Russian soldiers. “Your sons are killing Ukrainian civilians; women, children, entire families. They have come here for that and are systematically executing the orders of their superiors. They haven’t come for a ‘special operation’. They have come to exterminate the people. Russian soldiers are dying here, cursed by other mothers. Putin promised you compensation for their deaths. I don’t know what compensation can replace a child.”",News/World news,Olena Zelenska thanks other first ladies for supporting Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/olena-zelenska-thanks-first-ladies-supporting-ukraine
3/22/2022,"The first lady, Jill Biden, complained about her husband’s choice of Kamala Harris as running mate and now vice-president, according to a new book, asking: “There are millions of people in the United States. Why … do we have to choose the one who attacked Joe?” The quote is contained in This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future, by the New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, which is due to be published on 3 May. Excerpts have already been reported. Jill Biden’s reported remark was relayed by Politico on Tuesday. Harris made her mark in the Democratic primary – and bruised Biden – at a debate in Miami in June 2019, criticising his opposition to bussing, a way of racially integrating public schools, as a young senator in the 1970s. Biden was reportedly hurt by the insinuation he had been racist but still picked the California senator as his running mate and ultimately the first woman and person of color to be vice-president. A spokesman for Jill Biden, Michael Larosa, told Politico: “Many books will be written on the 2020 campaign, with countless retellings of events – some accurate, some inaccurate. The first lady and her team do not plan to comment on any of them.” Promising “juicy excerpts” of the new politics book, Politico said Martin and Burns offer extensive accounts of Harris’s struggles as vice-president. As allies complained about her “impossible” portfolio, including border security, the news website said, “Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s communications director, not only grew tired of the criticism that the White House was mismanaging Harris – she blamed the VP.” Martin and Burnswrite: “In private, Bedingfield had taken to noting that the vice-presidency was not the first time in Harris’s political career that she had fallen short of sky-high expectations: her Senate office had been messy and her presidential campaign had been a fiasco. Perhaps, she suggested, the problem was not the vice-president’s staff.” Bedingfield told Politico: “The fact that no one working on this book bothered to call to fact-check this unattributed claim tells you what you need to know. Vice-President Harris is a force in this administration and I have the utmost respect for the work she does every day to move the country forward.” Harris, the book says, does not want only to work on issues connected to women and Black Americans. In her attempts to lead the way on voting rights, however, she reportedly felt stymied by Biden’s reluctance to commit to serious Senate reform. Burns and Martin also report that Biden and Harris are “friendly but not close”, but say the president grew frustrated with leaks about Harris, warning aides that if “he found that any of them was stirring up negative stories about the vice-president … they would quickly be former staff”. The authors say Harris’s frustration was “up in the stratosphere”, according to an unnamed senator who “lamented that Harris’s political decline was a ‘slow-rolling Greek tragedy’. Her approval numbers were even lower than Biden’s, and other Democrats were already eyeing the 2024 race if Biden declined to run.” Biden, the oldest president ever inaugurated for the first time, will turn 82 shortly after the 2024 election. He has said he intends to run again. Whatever the accuracy of the reporting by Martin and Burns, it seems Harris may have cause to agree with a famous judgment by John Nance Garner, vice-president to Franklin D Roosevelt from 1933 to 1941. The vice-presidency, Garner said, “wasn’t worth a bucket of warm piss”.",News/US news,"Jill Biden criticized husband’s choice of Kamala Harris as running mate, book says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/22/jill-biden-kamala-harris-runing-mate-vice-president-book
3/22/2022,"The United Nations security council met earlier this month at Russia’s request, to discuss Moscow’s claims that the US is funding “military biological activities” in Ukraine – in other words, secretly developing biological weapons in Ukrainian laboratories. The event incited heated discussion. The Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, evoked the specter of an “uncontrolled spread of bio agents from Ukraine”. His American counterpart, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, warned that Russia’s claim could be a pretext for launching its own biological weapons attack on Ukraine. So what is the dispute all about, and what is actually happening inside Ukraine? How did ‘bio labs’ become the latest front in the Ukraine information war? Earlier in March, the Russian ministry of foreign affairs posted a tweet accusing the US and Ukraine of running a secret “military-biological programme” inside the stricken country. Moscow claimed its invading forces discovered evidence of an “emergency clean-up”. Moscow went on to claim that it had found documents related to the secret US operation in laboratories in Kharkiv and Poltava. The allegations were quickly amplified by China, which supported the claims during the UN security council debate. The theory took on a life of its own on social media under the hashtag #usbiolabs, and found a welcome home among rightwing outlets in the US including the War Room podcast of Donald Trump’s former adviser Steve Bannon and the Fox News primetime show hosted by Tucker Carlson. How have the US and Ukrainian governments responded? Both the US and Ukraine have categorically denied they are developing biological weapons inside the country. Thomas-Greenfield said: “I will say this once: ‘Ukraine does not have a biological weapons program.’” She went on to turn the accusation back on Moscow. “It is Russia that has long maintained a biological weapon program in violation of international law.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the world body, Sergiy Kyslytsya, called the idea being advanced by Russia “a bunch of insane delirium”. This week, speaking to business leaders in Washington, Joe Biden warned that Vladimir Putin could use biological weapons. “His back is against the wall,” said Biden, mentioning the false claims about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. “Now he’s talking about new false flags he’s setting up, including he’s asserting that, we, in America, have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe. Simply not true, I guarantee you.” What are independent world bodies saying? The World Health Organization (WHO) has said it is unaware of activity by Ukraine violating any international treaty, including the ban on biological weapons. The UN high commissioner for disarmament, Izumi Nakamitsu, confirmed that the UN was not aware of any biological weapons programmes in Ukraine. Nakamitsu pointed to the Biological Weapons Convention, which has prohibited the development and use of biological weapons since 1975. The convention was backed by Richard Nixon, who in 1969 also put a stop to the US developing its own offensive biological weapons. So do bio labs exist inside Ukraine, and is the US supporting them? Yes, and yes. Ukraine does operate biological laboratories that receive US funding. The US undersecretary of state Victoria Nuland affirmed those facts in a Senate foreign relations committee hearing this week, in which the Republican senator Marco Rubio asked directly if Ukraine had biological weapons. Nuland did not answer the question head on. “Ukraine has biological research facilities,” she said, adding that there was concern that Russian forces were trying to gain control of the labs. “We are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces.” Nuland’s comments were seized upon by far-right commentators as evidence of a secret plot. In fact, US funding to the laboratories had its roots in the fall of the Soviet Union, after which money was pumped into Ukraine and other countries to help them transfer scientific skills away from weapons towards public health. The scheme was originally known as Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) but is now more commonly referred to as biological engagement. It has been successful in helping former Soviet and other countries fulfill public health obligations. “This is one of the best things that we do,” Dr Gigi Gronvall, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Guardian. Most of the work of the Ukraine labs today, Gronvall said, involves surveillance of diseases in animals and people as an early-warning system for illnesses such as African swine fever, which is endemic in the region. “We know pathogens don’t respect borders, so helping to put out public health fires before they become too big is an advantage to all of us,” she said. Do the Ukraine laboratories store dangerous biological agents? As part of their work the labs do seem to hold dangerous pathogens. We know that because WHO is urging Ukraine to destroy any highly dangerous agents to avoid the risk of a disastrous outbreak should one of the labs be hit by Russian forces. “As part of this work, WHO has strongly recommended to the ministry ofhealth in Ukraine and other responsible bodies to destroy high-threatpathogens to prevent any potential spills,” the UN health agency said. The WHO has worked in Ukraine for several years helping bio labs improve safety and security, so it knows what it is talking about. If Russian claims of a secret bioweapons programme are fake news, does that mean there is nothing to worry about? No. In addition to the threat of pathogens held in Ukrainian labs leaking or falling into the hands of Russian forces, there is the threat of Russia launching its own biological weapons attack. The assessment of the US state department is that Russia continues to maintain an offensive biological weapons programme in violation of the convention it signed. Earlier this week, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, accused Russia under Putin of having a “long and well-documented track record” of using chemical weapons, pointing to the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny and Russia’s support of the Syrian regime while it deployed chemical weapons. She warned that Moscow’s claim of a secret biological weapons programme in Ukraine could in fact be laying the foundations for a Russian chemical or biological weapons assault. On Monday, Biden said Russia was “also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine … That’s a clear sign he is considering using both of those. “He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come. He knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front but the point is: it’s real.” That possibility leaves even seasoned experts rattled. “I hope that this is more of a disinformation talking point than an actual thing,” Gronvall said. “I guess we shall see.”",News/World news,What are Russia’s biological weapons claims and what’s actually happening?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/russia-biological-weapon-claim-us-un-ukraine-bio-labs-explainer
3/22/2022,"The parents of a teenage girl from Mid Wales have appeared in court charged with causing their daughter’s death by allowing her to become morbidly obese and not getting medical help for her. Kaylea Titford, 16, was found dead at her home in Newtown, Powys, in October 2020. Her father, Alun Titford, 44, and her mother, Sarah Lloyd-Jones, 39, are charged with gross negligence, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person. It is alleged that between 24 March and 11 October 2020, they failed to ensure Titford’s dietary needs were met, leading to morbid obesity. According to the charge they did not ensure she got enough exercise, was in a hygienic condition, lived in a safe and hygienic environment, that her physical health was maintained, or that reasonable medical help was sought. The pair appeared before Welshpool magistrates court on Tuesday and stood together in the dock wearing face masks. They spoke only to confirm their names, ages and address and did not enter any pleas.

3/22/2022,"A superyacht belonging to a sanctioned Russian oligarch has been seized in Gibraltar, becoming the latest vessel to be impounded by authorities. The $75m (£57m) Axioma belonging to billionaire Dmitry Pumpyansky – owner and chairman of steel pipe manufacturer OAO TMK, which is a supplier to Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom – was seized by authorities in the British overseas territory on Monday. The news emerged as two of Roman Abramovich’s superyachts were spotted docked in ports in Turkey, having cruised to new locations after the extension of sanctions to include the Chelsea FC owner. Yachts belonging to several Russian oligarchs have hastily arranged unplanned sailings, apparently moving them to avoid seizure by governments enforcing sanctions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Turkey has not yet joined western economic sanctions against Russia. After the seizure of Pumpyansky’s yacht by authorities in Gibraltar, the UK’s transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he was doing “all I can to cripple Russia’s aviation and shipping industries”.“It’s not just here in the UK those sanctions apply, either. They are being mirrored in our overseas territories too.” Pumpyansky was added to the UK and EU sanctions lists earlier this month. The yacht Eclipse, at nearly 163 metres (535ft) long the largest in the fleet linked to Abramovich, arrived in Marmaris on Tuesday morning. It had skirted EU waters south of the Greek island of Crete on its journey, according to data from the website Marine Traffic. Eclipse, which flies under the flag of Bermuda, had set sail east from St Maarten in the Caribbean towards international waters earlier in March, shortly after other oligarchs’ yachts were seized. The yacht boasts nine decks, two helipads and a 16-metre swimming pool that can be converted to a dancefloor, and is the most expensive vessel owned by individuals on the growing US, EU and UK sanction lists. Meanwhile, the superyacht Solaris, worth an estimated $600m and also owned by Abramovich, arrived in the Turkish port of Bodrum on Monday afternoon. The almost 138-metre vessel, which was delivered in 2021, left the Barcelona port where it had been undergoing repairs on 8 March, appearing to join the unplanned sailings of Russian oligarchs moving their superyachts to avoid seizure by governments enforcing sanctions. The Solaris was tracked passing the southern coast of Sicily on its voyage towards Turkey, although the tracking did not include any information about who was on board. A spokesperson for Abramovich did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The arrival of Solaris and Eclipse comes just days after a Gulfstream private jet linked to Abramovich was reported to have flown to Istanbul from Tel Aviv, according to flight tracking websites. Abramovich was photographed in the VIP lounge at Tel Aviv airport. The tycoon was added to the list of sanctioned individuals by the UK and the EU earlier in March. Alongside the assets including yachts and jets connected to the oligarch, Abramovich and his family have amassed a UK property collection worth more than £250m, numbering about 70 homes, buildings and pieces of land. The information was compiled by the Russian asset tracker, a partnership involving the Guardian, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and other international news organisations that are reporting on the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators.",News/World news,$75m superyacht belonging to Russian oligarch seized in Gibraltar,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/superyacht-belonging-to-russian-oligarch-seized-in-gibraltar
