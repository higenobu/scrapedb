1/21/2022,"A woman who drifted off to sleep in her seat during a United Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Virginia opened her eyes to find the man next to her touching her breast, federal officials said. When she yelled “get away from me,” the man hopped out of his seat and headed to the back of the plane, where he told a flight attendant he “sexually assaulted the woman sitting next to him,” according to prosecutors. Ivan Lopez, Jr., 26, is now facing a charge of “abusive sexual contact aboard an aircraft in flight” after the Dec. 24 flight bound for Washington Dulles International Airport, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia said in a Jan. 19 news release. If found guilty, he could face up to two years in prison. McClatchy News reached out to Lopez’s lawyer for comment on Jan. 19 and was awaiting a response. “The indictment alleges that she awoke to Lopez repeatedly rubbing her right breast. When the passenger opened her eyes, she allegedly observed Lopez leaning over her and his right hand was placed on her right breast,” officials said in the news release. The woman told an investigating FBI special agent that Lopez’s hand touching her breast was “not accidental,”, the affidavit states. She accused Lopez of touching her for roughly 10 seconds. A flight attendant told the FBI agent that Lopez admitted to grabbing the woman when he went to the back of the plane and “further stated that he thought he was in trouble and that he was sorry.” Then, the flight attendant said they immediately moved Lopez’s seat from the 12th row to the 21st row to keep him away from the woman. After, Lopez apologized to the flight attendant again and said “that he had a disability,” according to the affidavit. When the FBI agent interviewed Lopez the same day, he said “he wanted to get the woman’s attention by poking her on her right shoulder, so that he could ask her what she was listening to through her headphones,” the agent wrote. However, the agent wrote, Lopez said turbulence caused him to “accidentally” poke “her breast.” The official concluded in court documents they believe Lopez committed “a simple assault.” McClatchy News has reached out to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia for further information. The office’s news release also said another man, Elias Fethamlk — who was aboard a separate flight headed to Washington Dulles International Airport — is charged “with one count of interference with flight crew members and attendants, and one count of simple assault.” Fethamlk, 40, is accused of assaulting a flight attendant on an Ethiopian Airlines flight on Dec. 2, according to prosecutors. McClatchy News reached out to Fethamlk’s lawyer on Jan. 19 and was awaiting a response.

1/21/2022,"U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is trending on Twitter after making an insidious comment related to voting rights, in which he implied African Americans are not Americans.  After a vote to move the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to the Senate floor failed Wednesday, McConnell was asked by a reporter about concerns among voters of color.  ""Well the concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans,"" McConnell responded. A 19-second clip of the exchange was posted to Twitter late Wednesday and has been viewed nearly 1 million times.  ""Being Black doesn’t make you less of an American, no matter what this craven man thinks,"" former Kentucky Rep. Charles Booker tweeted.  ""In one quote, he summarized the entire GOP worldview. They think it’s a White nation and anyone who isn’t White isn’t a true American,"" tweeted another person.  More: Senate Democrats fail to advance voting rights legislation and changes to filibuster The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, named for the late Georgia Democratic representative and civil rights icon, would restore Justice Department review of changes in election laws in states with a history of discrimination.  According to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy group affiliated with the New York University School of Law, in 2021 at least 19 states passed 34 laws restricting access to voting. In a statement shortly after the legislation failed to advance, President Joe Biden said: ""I am profoundly disappointed that the United States Senate has failed to stand up for our democracy. I am disappointed — but I am not deterred. ""My Administration will never stop fighting to ensure that the heart and soul of our democracy — the right to vote — is protected at all costs. We will continue to work with allies to advance necessary legislation to protect the right to vote. And to push for Senate procedural changes that will protect the fundamental right to vote."" A bright future for Kentucky bridges? Millions in federal funds made available for repairs In an opinion piece submitted to The Courier Journal, McConnell categorized the new legislation as a power grab by Democrats.  ""Washington Democrats have desperately wanted to take over our elections for years, even though their justification seems to change every election cycle,"" he wrote. ""After losing the White House in 2016, they said the takeover was necessary because our democracy was fundamentally broken. ""Now that they’ve won the White House, their story has flipped: Our democracy is in perfect shape, except when Republican-controlled states dare to pass mainstream voting laws."" In that piece, when differentiating between voters, McConnell wrote about Black and white voter turnout, not African American and American.  USA Today reporters Savannah Behrmann and Ledyard King contributed to this story.

1/21/2022,"With freezing weather sweeping into Texas late this week, subsidiaries for a major pipeline company are threatening to cut off natural gas to the state’s largest power generator — which could impact the electricity supply for hundreds of thousands of customers — over a financial dispute stemming from last February’s deadly winter storm. Vistra Corp. subsidiary Luminant on Wednesday asked the Railroad Commission of Texas, which regulates the state’s oil and gas industry, to prevent Energy Transfer LP from cutting off fuel to five Vistra power plants, which produce enough electricity to power 400,000 Texas homes, businesses and critical infrastructure such as hospitals and schools. The companies under Energy Transfer, the pipeline company, have told Vistra that gas will stop flowing to five Vistra power plants on Monday unless Vistra pays Energy Transfer $21.6 million, according to the filing. The “threat to terminate service in the middle of winter is illegal and grossly irresponsible and should be prohibited by this Commission,” Vistra said in the complaint to the Railroad Commission. Vistra called the move by Energy Transfer, run by billionaire Kelcy Warren, “a form of commercial extortion.” During last year’s winter storm — which caused the near-total collapse of the state’s power grid, left millions without power for days and caused hundreds of deaths — Vistra spent approximately $1.5 billion for natural gas, “twice its planned natural gas cost to fuel its entire Texas fleet for a full year,” the filing said. Vistra paid Energy Transfer more than $600 million during the storm, “which is more than 96% of all amounts invoiced by [Energy Transfer].” The cost for natural gas soared during the storm, when a combination of freezing temperatures across the state and skyrocketing demand shut down natural gas facilities and power plants, which rely on each other to keep electricity flowing. While many companies lost money during the storm, Energy Transfer made $2.4 billion. Energy Transfer did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Pipeline company threatens to cut off gas supply to Texas’ biggest power generator,https://news.yahoo.com/pipeline-company-threatens-cut-off-154717132.html

1/21/2022,"Trump's PAC sent House Republicans a note saying leadership ""should have never certified"" the 2020 election. The note, signed by Trump, was sent with a copy of conservative writer Mollie Hemingway's book. All current members of House Republican leadership voted to overturn the 2020 election result. Former President Donald Trump's political action committee sent House Republicans a book from a conservative writer and a note, signed by Trump, that said House GOP leadership ""should have never certified"" the results of the 2020 election on January 6, 2021, Politico Playbook reported. Trump's Save America PAC sent House Republicans a copy of writer Mollie Hemingway's book ""RIGGED: How the Media, Big Tech, and the Democrats Seized Our Elections,"" according to Politico. The accompanying note repeated Trump's thoroughly debunked lies about fraud in the 2020 election. ""There is no question. American democracy was under siege during the 2020 Presidential election,"" Trump wrote. The note went on to say: ""Republican leadership should have never certified the election on January 6, and now, Democrats will not stop their assault on America — our freedom, faith, family, and values. I will never stop fighting for the country we love. I hope you find this book informative and encouraging in your battle for the heart of our nation."" The gift ""just shows how Trump is continuing to pressure members/Republicans to embrace the Big Lie"" ahead of the 2022 midterms as many Republicans want to shift focus to criticizing the Democratic leadership in Washington, a House Republican aide told Playbook. In all, seven GOP Senators and 138 Republican members of the House voted to object to counting slates of Electoral College votes from Arizona, Pennsylvania, or both states. Neither objection secured the majority necessary to throw out an Electoral College slate in either chamber, and only one member of Senate Republican leadership, Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, voted to sustain an Electoral College objection. Every current member of Republican House leadership, however, voted to sustain the objections to Congress counting the electoral votes from one or both states during the joint session on January 6 when Congress reconvened after the violent siege on the Capitol. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, and Republican Policy Committee Chairman Rep. Gary Palmer voted in favor of the objection to both Arizona and Pennsylvania's slates, and now-GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik voted to sustain the objection to Pennsylvania's electoral votes. Rep. Jim Banks, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, also voted in favor of both objections. The GOP Conference Chair at the time, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, voted against objecting to electoral votes, and was subsequently voted out of her position leading the Republican conference. Cheney, now a top Trump foe, is now the vice-chairwoman of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection.

1/21/2022,"A former Vermont legislator and House majority leader has died with the help of a law he himself helped pass that allows the terminally ill to end their own lives, his wife said. Willem Jewett died Jan. 12 at his home in Ripton at age 58, said his wife, Ellen McKay Jewett. He was diagnosed with mucosal melanoma over a year ago. In the days before his death, he supported changes to the 2013 law to make it easier for terminally ill people to navigate and get a prescription, VTDigger first reported. “It is very Willem fashion to still be pushing for legislation that he believed in and using his ability to advocate for people,” his daughter Abigail Jewett said Wednesday. Jewett, a lawyer and a competitive cyclist, served in the Vermont House from 2003 to 2016, where he was known for his energy, humor and intelligence — and for riding his bicycle more than 50 miles to the Statehouse for the annual Earth Day ride. The Democrat became assistant majority leader in 2011 and later majority leader. “He lived life as if there wasn't a moment to spare,” said House Speaker Shap Smith. In the Legislature, he was great to work with, very smart and “definitely had a feisty side,” Smith said. When the House gave final approval to the bill in 2013 after a day of debate in which members told stories of their own loved ones’ deaths, Jewett, then majority leader, said: “I’ve listened to all these stories, very personal stories, and I respect every single one of them.” Under the legislation, he said, ""we all get to remain true to our guideposts at the end of our life.” Jewett was critical in helping to organize a strategy on the bill, ensuring the House had the votes and then working with leadership to get support from senators, Smith said. Along with others, “his support was really critical,” said Betsy Walkerman, president of Patient Choices Vermont, a nonprofit organization. “He’s very proud of this bill,” she said. Jewett reached out to the group Dec. 29 about his own experience with the law and proposed changes now under consideration. Walkerman spoke to him by phone Jan. 7, five days before he died. He “just wanted to add his voice, which is incredibly powerful because he has this dual role as a legislator and a patient, a person near the end of life, who’s making choices,” she said.",U.S./Associated Press,Legislator dies using medical suicide law he helped pass,https://news.yahoo.com/legislator-dies-using-medical-suicide-195657294.html
