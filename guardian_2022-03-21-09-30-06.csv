3/21/2022,"Former journalist Roman Kruglyakov left his home town of Mariupol to stay in a nearby village at the beginning of the war. Over three days in mid March, he made three trips back to the devastated city to pick up trapped family members. They had had no phone signal for over two weeks. Entering the place where he grew up was like entering hell, he says. “People were coming out of burnt out multi-storey apartment blocks to cook food on fires in the street.” “I was driving and there were bits of shells and electricity cables and dead bodies up and down the streets.” Kruglyakov wanted to pick up his two godmothers and their families. The first godmother was shocked to see him but quickly gathered her family’s belongings. “She never thought anyone would risk their life for her.” Next he collected his mother, whose apartment block was the only one on that street that had escaped shelling, and drove them out. Then he returned for his other godmother, who had a two-month old baby – but her husband was too frightened to leave their apartment. “As I understood it, as people who had been through so much, they were just too scared to even leave.” They tossed a coin but it told them to stay. “I gave them two minutes to think because you can’t leave your car for too long, people could steal the tyres. The shrapnel from the weapons punctured practically all the tyres.” In the end, his godmother and her husband refused to leave. He then went to a shelter at a local school and collected a family with children at the request of other relatives living outside Mariupol. “I went to take people from basements but they didn’t want to leave because they were so used to sitting there. They were scared of what awaited them outside the concrete walls. They were being destroyed every night. I had to use force to get them out. I lied to them, whatever I could think of, I said ‘there’s hot food waiting for you, electricity, mobile phone signal’ I lied and I’m not ashamed. I believe that the people I got out are in less danger than they were inside the city.” Mariupol is now completely surrounded by Russian forces, said Kruglyakov, who said he saw Russian soldiers on every corner in the areas he drove to. “When you meet these people they are in complete despair. They tell me that they will stay in the basements and wait for the humanitarian convoy and they will evacuate to Ukraine. But I understand that will never happen.”“It won’t come. Not now or in the next few days or month, it won’t come.” Kruglyakov took his relatives to Melekine, a neighbouring seaside town recently occupied by the Russians which is the first point of safety for refugees leaving Mariupol. “We’ve decided to go to Rostov [over the border in Russia] and try to find work and housing. It’s better than living in an unrecognised territory,” he said as he explained that it is very difficult to get to Ukrainian controlled territory because of the lack of petrol and the distances involved. “The claims by Ukrainian media that people are being evacuated to [the city of] Zaporizhzhia are misleading. People have to walk 86 kilometres to the neighbouring [city of] Berdyansk, unless they are one of the few who have cars” “Out of the 25 people who I took out, there was not one who wanted to evacuate to Russia – they all want to go to Zaporizhzhia but not everyone is able to.” “If the evacuation route was extended to Manhush,” he said of another town closer to Mariupol, “Then people could walk to Manhush.” He and his wife won’t return to Mariupol but the older generations in his family might if gas, water and electricity are restored. All but two of their properties have been destroyed or severely damaged.",News/World news,‘Some were too scared to leave’: the man who rescued 25 people from devastated Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/some-were-too-scared-to-leave-the-man-who-rescued-25-people-from-devastated-mariupol
3/21/2022,"Smacking and slapping children has been outlawed in Wales, with people told to contact social services or police if they see a parent or carer meting out physical punishment. The law change, which came into force first thing on Monday, was hailed as “historic” by the Labour-led Welsh government and a number of child protection champions, who called for England to follow suit. But critics, including the Welsh Conservatives, expressed concerns that it would criminalise parents trying to do their best and create a “Stasi culture” with people “shopping” their neighbours and even making malicious allegations. The legislation that has come into force removes the defence of “reasonable punishment” that has been in force since Victorian times in England and Wales and makes all forms of physical punishment against children, such as smacking, hitting, slapping and shaking illegal. The law will apply to everybody in Wales, including visitors. Julie Morgan, the deputy minister for social services, who has campaigned for the law change for more than two decades, said: “Today is a historic moment for children and their rights in Wales as we make physically punishing children a thing of the past.” Morgan rejected the notion the law would create a “Stasi culture”. She said: “We don’t want people spying,” but added: “Looking after children is the responsibility of the whole community.” Morgan said attitudes had changed in recent years with few parents now using physical punishment. “The culture has started to change and I think this law will reinforce that,” she added. She said she hoped England would follow the example of Wales and Scotland, which brought in a ban in November 2020. She said: “We’d love it to happen in England. We’re happy to work with people in England to push this forward.” Viv Laing, the policy and public affairs manager at NSPCC Cymru Wales, said both England and Northern Ireland, where there has been no law change, were outliers. She said: “In Wales, as in more than 60 countries around the world, we will no longer tolerate physical violence against children. Until now, children were the only group in our society who it was acceptable to strike in certain circumstances. We don’t allow the physical punishment of adults or animals, so it is absurd that we have for so long with children.” The Welsh government’s website makes it clear that anyone who physically punishes a child will be breaking the law, risks being arrested or charged with assault and may get a criminal record. In a Q&A section, the question “What should I do if I see a child being physically punished or if I am concerned about a child?” is posed. The answer is: “Contact your local social services department … You can also call the police in an emergency or if a child is in immediate danger.” The government says the police and Crown Prosecution Service will apply two tests: is there evidence to charge and is it in the public interest to do so. They will also consider what is in the best interests of the child. It stresses that “rough and tumble” play is permitted. The Welsh Conservative and shadow social services minister, Gareth Davies, said the law was “unnecessary, unworkable, and undesired” and had been pushed through by politicians who thought they knew better than parents. He said: “I am very worried about campaigns that encourage a Stasi culture in Wales where people – and children – are encouraged to shop parents who discipline their children in what they deem a proportionate manner into the police. “The Labour government in Cardiff Bay is clearly more interested in new age dogma rather than respecting parents.” ",News/UK news,Wales introduces ban on smacking  and slapping children,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/wales-introduces-ban-on-smacking-and-slapping-children
3/21/2022,"The average price tag on a home in Great Britain has topped £350,000 for the first time, according to Rightmove. Typical asking prices hit £354,564 in March, up 1.7% or £5,760 compared with February, the property website said. It was the biggest monthly rise for this time of year in 18 years, and pushed the annual rate of growth in asking prices to 10.4%. Annual growth was above 10% for all regions and countries except London and Scotland. Rightmove said the jump in asking price was partly driven by a huge mismatch between supply and demand, with more than twice as many buyers as sellers. For those putting their home on the market, the chance of finding a buyer in the first week is higher than it has ever been for this time of year, and twice as likely compared with the same period in 2019. Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s director of property data, said: “Many of those who are selling in this record-breaking market obviously also face the prospect of buying again in the same market, and being in fierce competition against other buyers. “Having a buyer for your own property, subject to contract, puts those who are buying again in a powerful position compared to buyers who have yet to sell, and agents report that these ‘power buyers’ are more likely to get the property that they want and negotiate the best deal on price.” The Rightmove data is the latest evidence to suggest that two years on from the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the housing market continues to defy economic conditions and the strong market that was boosted by the stamp duty holiday has yet to fade. A demand for larger homes, partly as some buyers seek more space to work from home, helped to drive a 3.4% increase in asking prices for homes with four bedrooms or more. The trend also encouraged new sellers to come to market, with 12% more new listings in this sector than at this time last year, according to the property website. Kate Eales, head of regional agency at Strutt & Parker, said: “The trend of a significant number of people planning to work from home for three days a week or more in the longer term has created new hotspots across the country for part-time commuters including Shropshire, North Cotswolds and Suffolk.”",News/Business,"Average house price in Great Britain exceeds £350,000 for first time",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/21/average-house-price-in-great-britain-exceeds-350000-for-first-time
3/21/2022,"Rishi Sunak should consider raising benefits and pensions to keep pace with inflation, research has suggested, as the chancellor faced increasing pressure to tackle the cost-of-living squeeze in this week’s spring budgetary statement. Increasing benefits by an extra five percentage points, by 8.1% rather than the 3.1% currently planned, would give four times as much help for low-to-middle income households for every pound spent as scrapping the planned national insurance rise, the Resolution Foundation said. The report by the living standards thinktank came as Sunak made final preparations for Wednesday’s statement, which is expected to include at least some extra measures to deal with a combined shock from energy price rises and inflation, one which Treasury officials say is unprecedented since the 1970s. One possible measure could be a cut to fuel duty, with Sunak using an interview round on Sunday to stress that he understood the pressure of rising petrol and diesel costs on people who are reliant on cars. It remains unclear what, if anything, he might do in terms of extra help for domestic energy bills, which are expected to soar in April and most likely again in October. Sunak refused to say how many people could be pushed into fuel poverty, arguing only that people should not be scared. A number of Conservative MPs have called on Sunak to help people by scrapping the imminent 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions for employees and employers, saying this would help those in need. Labour also opposes the rise. But the study by the Resolution Foundation calculated that doing this would see half the gains go to the richest fifth of households, with just £1 in every £6 helping low-to-middle income households in the bottom half of the distribution. In contrast, the 8.1% rise in pensions and benefits would cost the same – around £9bn – but would see three-quarters of the help go to people in the lower half of incomes. One of the trickiest areas Sunak must face on Wednesday is the impact of home energy bills. Appearing before the chancellor on BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, consumer expert Martin Lewis predicted that 10 million UK people could soon experience fuel poverty. Sunak disputed Lewis’s figure – “I don’t know if he presented any analysis to show that” – but was unwilling, despite repeated questioning, to say how many people he believed would be affected. While declining to speculate on what, if any, extra help might come this week, Sunak said people should “judge me by my actions over the past two years”, adding: “Where we have been able to make a difference, I have tried to do that.” Treasury sources have argued that because wholesale energy prices are so volatile, particularly given the invasion of Ukraine, responding to the squeeze is difficult. This could mean that if the crisis worsens in the coming months Sunak would consider offering new help. Questioned about another likely rise in energy bills in October, when the price cap for the bills is next reassessed, Sunak said: “We don’t know and I don’t want people to be scared. What we have is a price cap that will protect people all the way through to the autumn. We’ve acted now to help them with the increase that is coming in, in April. The situation is obviously very volatile in Ukraine.” Separately, Labour is to use an opposition day debate on Monday to argue that some older people could become nearly £1,400 worse off over the next two years because of a combination of higher bills, the national insurance rise, and pensions rising by less than inflation. An analysis from the House of Commons library, commissioned by Labour, said a working pensioner on an average salary, who gets a state pension and is liable for the national insurance rise, would see a real-term income reduction of £770 in 2022/23 and £622 in 2023/24. The national insurance increase is billed as a long-term solution to pay for adult social care, although it will initially be used to finance attempts to clear the backlog of NHS procedures built up by the disruption of Covid. Speaking on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Sunak defended the plan, saying it was still necessary, despite the increase in energy costs. “Ukraine has come along and made things more difficult but it hasn’t changed the underlying situation that we’ve got this monumental backlog that we want to work through,” he said. “Although this is a difficult decision, I think it’s a fair way to do it and it’s a responsible way to do it.”",News/UK news,"Raise benefits and pensions to help lower earners, thinktank tells Rishi Sunak",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/raise-benefits-and-pensions-to-help-lower-earners-thinktank-tells-rishi-sunak
3/21/2022,"Whistle while you work? French choreographer Boris Charmatz goes several steps better, whistling while he dances. And how: warbles, trills, hoots, wheezes, gargles and yes, a few tunes too, including bits from Bach, Sinatra, the Pink Panther and the spaghetti western. All this during an hour-long solo which starts with a somnambulant walk in near-darkness and continues through circuit jogging, pat-a-cake slaps, hurls, dives, bum-shuffling, creepy-crawling and plain old lying down and taking a breather. Entitled Somnole, the piece explores the state between sleeping and waking. Charmatz, bare-bodied but for a pleated skirt, becomes less a performer than a vessel, a fleshy instrument of pipes and cavities that resound with thoughts and images that are not his own, but rather flow through him from the ether. It’s engrossing; also, meandering. How to respond to Gisèle Vienne’s magical, banal, exasperating, grandiloquent, seductive, repulsive, overpowering, underwhelming, gratuitous and never less than impactful staging (the terms dance, theatre or installation seem misleading) that she titles This Is How You Will Disappear? It feels less like a “piece” than some deranged, mushroomy manifestation from the dank compost of the human psyche. The setting is an impressively rendered forest, frequently so fogged that its mists roll right out into the audience. In one particularly hallucinatory scene, it seems to breathe, glow and growl like a living creature. The noisome soundtrack (Stephen O’Malley and Peter Rehberg) ranges from drenching amplifications and reverbs to thunderous rumblings and sonic smears. Sound and set rather upstage the action, which involves three slow-moving characters: Jonathan Capdevielle as a sadistic coach, Nuria Guiu Sagarra a trainee gymnast (note that the work was created in 2010, years before stories began breaking of widespread sexual abuse in gymnastics), and Jonathan Schatz a pale rock star who, according to a voiceover (text by regular Vienne collaborator Dennis Cooper), has murdered and raped his girlfriend. Coach bludgeons the rock star and fastens like a vampire to his neck. The gymnast sings a plaintively innocent song. Four lifesize figures in hoodies stand next to an orange tent. The coach shoots arrows into a tree. In comes a real-life wolf-dog (in other productions of this piece, it’s a bird of prey). Everything swells with portent – but why? Haven’t the foggiest.

3/21/2022,"The NHS in England will on Monday start giving a second booster vaccine to millions of people who are at higher risk from Covid-19 to help combat the latest resurgence in infections. Over-75s, care home residents and those who are immunocompromised – 5 million in all – will be contacted by the NHS and then be able to book an appointment online or by calling 119. The new rollout of booster jabs comes after the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised the government last month that those three at-risk groups should be offered a top-up because the immunity from their first booster was waning. Cases of Covid are rising again, with 90,349 cases recorded on Friday across the UK, according to official figures, more than double the 39,000 seen on 1 March. However, the true number of infections is higher. The Office for National Statistics estimates that one in 20 people in England had Covid in the week up to 12 March. The number of people in UK hospitals with Covid had risen to 14,671 by last Thursday. Experts believe the increase is linked to people spending more time at their work premises, greater socialisation in bars and other venues and the lifting of restrictions. Provision of the second boosters began in Scotland on 7 March and in Wales last week. England will follow suit from Monday when several hundred sites – including high street pharmacies, vaccination centres and hospitals – start delivering the jabs. Dr Nikki Kanani, a GP who is the deputy lead for the NHS vaccination programme, said: “Sadly, we are still seeing large numbers of people seriously unwell in hospital with Covid, so it remains vital that those most at risk come forward when they are invited to do so.” Ruth Rankine, the director of primary care at the NHS Confederation, which represents groups of GP surgeries, also urged those who are eligible to get their top-up. “As we learn to live with Covid-19, and in the face of the new dominant BA.2 variant, we must use all the tools in our arsenal, of which vaccination has been the most important,” she said. When the JCVI recommended the spring booster programme last month to protect the most vulnerable, the committee said it would also set out advice on an autumn top-up campaign, but gave no details. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, hinted last week that it would encompass many more people than those covered by the spring campaign. “[The JCVI’s] most recent advice is that they think that towards the end of this year, maybe in the autumn, there will be a need to give a lot more people a boost,” he said.",News/World news,NHS rollout of second Covid booster jabs begins in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/nhs-rollout-second-covid-booster-jab-begins-in-england
