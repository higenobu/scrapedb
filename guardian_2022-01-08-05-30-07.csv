1/8/2022,"Overworked social workers struggled to put in place effective measures to support a vulnerable Eritrean teenager seeking asylum who went on to kill himself, an inquest has concluded. The death of Alexander Tekle, who died a few months after turning 18 and less than a year after arriving in the UK, was a tragedy, the Westminster coroner Bernard Richmond said. Tekle killed himself in December 2017 in Mitcham, south London.  A dispute over Tekle’s real age meant that he was placed in inappropriate adult Home Office accommodation when he was still a child. Tekle had been making progress in settling down in the care of Kent county council before he was wrongly deemed to have turned 18, and as a result lost the support services available to unaccompanied child asylum seekers. The coroner concluded that Kent “did not do anywhere as much as they might have done to keep Alex in their care”, and as a result an opportunity to support him was lost. Several factors led to him falling through the net, the coroner concluded, highlighting that he had been assigned to an inexperienced social worker when instead he needed someone who recognised that he was in a “destructive spiral”. The inquest heard that another social worker responsible for Tekle’s welfare was working with a caseload of 25 young people and struggled to find the time to provide the intensive support he needed. Tekle’s inquest is the last to be heard into the suicides of four young Eritrean asylum seekers, all friends, who took their lives within a 16-month period after arriving in the UK. The inquests have shone a spotlight on how young unaccompanied asylum seekers are looked after by local authorities on arrival in the UK. Tekle was described by the coroner as a “well-loved and loving son and brother” who had “in his short life had to cope with a number of challenges which no 16 or 17-year-old should have to face”. He arrived in the UK hidden in the back of a refrigerated lorry at the end of December 2016, weeks after French police cleared the informal refugee camp in Calais. The inquest heard that Tekle began using alcohol during the year he spent living in very difficult and dangerous conditions in the Calais camp, and had developed a serious alcohol addiction by the time he was moved from Kent to London, when he was placed in the care of Croydon council. Friends said he used alcohol to manage extreme stress connected with witnessing fellow refugees die during his journey from Eritrea and with the constant anxiety he felt about problems with his asylum application. He was also very depressed by the recent suicide of his friend Filmon Yemane. Although two of his key workers gave him support “above and beyond what might have been expected” they were unable to get Tekle into an alcohol rehabilitation facility quickly enough. Yemane had recently turned 18 when he took his own life in November 2017. Osman Ahmed Nur, 19, was found dead on 10 May 2018 in a communal area of a young people’s hostel in Camden, north London. Mulubrhane Medhane Kfleyosus, 19, was found dead on 18 February 2019 in Milton Keynes. Benjamin Hunter, who met Tekle as a volunteer in Calais, and who continued to support him in the UK, said: “The wider context of this is that the UK government has cut the budgets available to local authority children’s services to the bone. This government has scapegoated asylum seekers and attacked unaccompanied children as frauds.“Alex was deeply caring. He wanted to study, to improve his English, to give back to his family. He will be forever missed by his parents, his older brother, his two younger sisters, and those of us who were his friends. We want to make sure that what happened to Alex never happens to anyone ever again.” Helen Johnson, the head of children’s services at the Refugee Council, said the barriers faced by child refugees trying to get the care and support they needed on arrival in the UK were “hugely damaging”. “Often the capacity and capability of hard-pressed and under-resourced children’s social services means the needs of these extremely vulnerable children and young people aren’t always met. We urgently need to review the way our asylum system and our children’s social care system treats them so they are given the best possible chance of a safe future,” she said.

1/8/2022,"A fourth Covid vaccine shot is not yet needed, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has said, as booster shots are still providing strong protection against severe disease from Omicron in older people. Latest figures show that, for the over-65s, protection against hospitalisation remains at about 90% three months after the third jab, according to the UK Health Security Agency.  Protection against severe disease from only two doses of the vaccine drops to around 70% after three months and 50% after six months. It means the JCVI has recommended the government continues to prioritise the third jab booster drive for all adults for now, rather than beginning to provide a fourth vaccine dose to vulnerable groups such as the over-80s or care home residents. It marks the UK’s departure from Israel’s vaccination strategy, which is pursuing fourth shots for the over-60s and medical staff. “The current data show the booster dose is continuing to provide high levels of protection against severe disease, even for the most vulnerable older age groups,” said Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI’s chair of Covid-19 immunisation. “For this reason, the committee has concluded there is no immediate need to introduce a second booster dose, though this will continue to be reviewed.” He added the data is “highly encouraging” and emphasises the value of a booster jab. “With Omicron continuing to spread widely, I encourage everyone to come forward for their booster dose, or if unvaccinated, for their first two doses, to increase their protection against serious illness.” The data is based on a UK Health Security Agency study looking at booster doses in the over-65s, among the first to be eligible for a booster from the campaign’s launch in mid-September. Data on booster protection from mild symptomatic infection shows it is less long-lasting, however, dropping to about 30% by about three months. The JCVI said the main aim of the vaccination campaign is to prevent severe disease – not prevent all infections, which would require an unsustainable level of repeated vaccinations. It comes after the UK on Friday reported 178,250 new infections, a 47% climb on the 121,371 new cases reported on Friday two weeks ago. A further 229 Covid-related deaths were recorded on Friday, a 67% rise on the 137 deaths reported on Friday two weeks ago. Omicron continues to put huge stress on the NHS, with the health service in England experiencing the highest number of Covid absences since the vaccine rollout, with more than 40,000 staff unable to attend work on two days in the past week. This has led to claims hospitals are “simply not safe”. The percentage of the eligible population vaccinated with a third or booster dose is now 61%, according to government data, compared to 90.2% for at least one shot and 82.8% for two doses.",News/World news,"Fourth Covid jab not yet needed, JCVI says, as booster protecting older people",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/fourth-covid-jab-not-yet-needed-jcvi-says-as-booster-protecting-older-people
1/8/2022,"‘We took the club over during a pandemic and people said we were crackers,” says Chesterfield’s chief executive, John Croot, as he considers the thought of 6,000 long-suffering fans converging on Stamford Bridge. “But someone had to do something.” On Saturday evening the National League side will face Chelsea and, whether or not they contrive a shock for the ages, their presence advertises an eye-catching change in fortunes. The Spireites had been a staple of the Football League’s lower divisions for almost a century when they plummeted through the trapdoor in 2018 and things almost got much worse. But last year they were saved by a takeover from the Chesterfield FC Community Trust, an independent charity affiliated to the club since 2009, and the turnaround in the subsequent 17 months has been extraordinary.  “When we completed the deal, the fans asked us what our ambition for the year was,” says Croot. “We just said: ‘To make sure we’ve got a football club at the end of the season.’” Chesterfield ended up with more than that. They rediscovered genuine hope on the pitch, rebuilding a side that had finished 20th in 2019-20 and, via a play-off defeat by Notts County in June, finished 2021 two points clear at the top. A return to the fourth tier under James Rowe, their bright young manager, looks distinctly possible. But they also forged a bond with their local area that few can match. No other club in the top five divisions is entirely fan-owned and they hope the model can point a way forward. “It’s given us a unique opportunity to embed the club in the community,” Croot says. “While multimillionaires might buy a club, I’m not sure they ever truly own it.” Once a programme seller at Saltergate, Chesterfield’s former stadium, Croot became a club director and headed up a supporters’ society that saved them from being kicked out of the league in 2001. When the trust took over from Dave Allen last August, backed by Chesterfield borough council and Derbyshire county council, the club had faced another existential crisis. Now they are making a difference: the trust is on course for a £2m turnover, a world away from the £30,000 it took after being formed, and Croot says every pound it receives from the county council generates a £12 economic return on social outcomes. A list of its schemes would stretch to several pages. Last week several hundred hampers were delivered to deprived families across north Derbyshire; Croot is particularly proud of the alcohol and substance recovery programme, as well as the walking football initiative it founded a decade ago. Supporters feel the club are looking out for them and the goodwill works both ways: late last year, some time before hearing they would land a Chelsea-shaped windfall, Chesterfield sought crowd funding of £15,000 for new pitch covers and the target was exceeded comfortably. “We needed to reinvigorate the community and the next generation of supporters needed to be inspired,” says Rowe. “Now it’s about the progression.” The 38-year-old, whose father Colwyn coached the Botswana national team in the 2000s among other diverse roles, has been at the forefront of that. They have not looked back since he arrived from Gloucester City in November 2020, finishing the last calendar year with the third-best record in the country and losing once in the league this season. Rowe was a prolific non-league striker before retiring at 27 and taking youth coaching roles with Birmingham and West Ham. After the latter he relocated to the Netherlands, taking a master’s in coaching at the Johan Cruyff Institute in Amsterdam, and he credits the experience as being transformative. While many managers will reel off instantly recognisable names as their coaching inspirations, Rowe admits his is “a bit out of the box”: he describes Maarten van Heeswijk, a former Dutch Olympic hockey coach who is a professor on the course, as “my mentor … still a strong influence on me now”, and the pair speak weekly. He has assembled a team of varied talent that includes the sought-after striker Kabongo Tshimanga, who has 19 goals this season, and Harry Maguire’s brother Laurence. The goalkeeper Scott Loach, 39-year-old forward Nathan Tyson and captain Curtis Weston add the kind of experience that will be valuable in west London. Weston became the youngest player – at 17 years, 119 days – to appear in an FA Cup final when playing the final few minutes of Millwall’s defeat by Manchester United in 2004. He swapped shirts with Mikaël Silvestre and hopes his seniority earns him a crack at N’Golo Kanté this time. “It brings back memories,” he says. “I’d only played one senior game before that. It was heart-racing time, very nervous, even if I only played a couple of minutes. I just wanted to get out there and rub shoulders with some of my idols.” Rowe will not begrudge his players butterflies for this one, admitting you would be “in the wrong sport” if they did not rear up when lining up opposite Chelsea. It is a cliche but there is a sense Chesterfield have already won by progressing this far. “It’s a bonus, a fantastic marker to say we’re back on the map as a club,” Rowe continues. “It’s a day to smile, to take it all in and put it in the memory.” For Croot, it is a chance to pause briefly and dwell on their rejuvenated prospects. “To find ourselves walking down the King’s Road now, playing the European champions, is unbelievable,” he says. “I can’t say the job is complete, but there will be a bit of reflection when I look over to our fans.”",Sport/Football,Fan-owned Chesterfield on rise and taking aim at Chelsea’s millionaires,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/fan-owned-chesterfield-on-rise-chelsea-millionaires-fa-cup
