4/27/2022,"The flagship public health body set up by Boris Johnson to combat the pandemic is in turmoil, with plans looming to cut jobs by up to 40% and suspend routine Covid testing in hospitals and care homes to save money. Whitehall sources have told the Guardian that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), led by Dr Jenny Harries, is in a state of disarray, with morale at rock bottom and concerns it is not funded to cope with any resurgence in the pandemic. Public health experts warned that the “alarming” cuts could cost lives. More than 800 staff are due to be lost from vital health protection teams across the country in the coming months, a reduction of 40% from the current 2,000 members of staff. One insider said people were being given two weeks’ notice that their contracts were being ended early, and the way it was being dealt with was similar to the “recent situation at P&O”. Some other teams throughout the organisation have also been told they need to cut full-time equivalent staff by 40%. After the Treasury slashed its budget to deal with Covid, UKHSA is now proposing to health ministers that it suspend regular asymptomatic testing in hospitals and care homes from May to save money before a potential winter spike in cases. Sources in the organisation said funding for asymptomatic testing in high risk settings is only enough to cover six months in a year, and senior officials believe it would be better saved for later in the year. The proposals come after the government heavily scaled back its provision of free testing for the general public as part of its ‘Living with Covid’ plan, with the previous year’s budget of £15bn cut by about 90%. At the time, the government said asymptomatic testing would continue in high risk settings while prevalence was still high. Public health experts warned that cuts to testing and health protection staff were “irresponsible”, shortsighted and risked a resurgence of Covid, especially among health and social care workers. Covid prevalence levels in England fell significantly to 1 in 17 people in the week ending 16 April, compared with 1 in 14 in the previous week. However, officials said they still regard this level as high prevalence. Prof Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health which represents 4,000 public health professionals across the UK, said: “If the Covid-19 pandemic has taught us one thing, it is the importance of having a properly funded public health system that is able to prepare for, and respond to, threats to our health. “Government has consistently under-funded public health services which are there to protect and improve health for all. To not only fail to bolster the public health system, but to continue to cut it so deeply, is irresponsible and threatens the health of all in society, particularly the most vulnerable.” Dr Jyotsna Vohra, director of policy and public affairs at the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “It is deeply concerning to hear about cuts to the UKHSA workforce when we are still in a pandemic. Strong, consistent health protection messaging and activities are vital at this time. “To remove free asymptomatic testing from health and social care workers feels irresponsible. With high exposure to the virus and to our elderly and most vulnerable members of our population, the health and social care workforce must have the greatest possible confidence in their infection status. Asymptomatic testing provides this. “At a time when infection rates are still high, this feels like we are saving pennies at the cost of pounds, or worse, lives,” said Vohra. Labour also criticised the proposals to strip away more testing for NHS staff. Shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, said: “While the NHS is in a permanent state of crisis and patients are waiting longer than ever for care, the government can’t seriously be considering stripping away support even further. “Patients need to know that they will be safe when they go into hospital and care homes. These proposals risk leaving the NHS unprotected and unprepared.” Staff at UKHSA told the Guardian that job cuts and the reduction in funding for public health measures have left an “exhausted” and demoralised rump of permanent staff at the organisation. One source said many remaining employees were in a state of “ever-increasing anger and despair at the organisation’s leadership and approach to its staff and strategy”. Many are also angry over a debacle affecting about 300 UKHSA staff, who were told they were wrongly being paid a £3,700 London weighting and that this would be removed. The organisation is now in discussions with its unions over the episode. The job cuts are a mixture of ending fixed term contracts and redeploying or giving notice to civil service payroll staff. “Many, many people are jumping ship,” said a third source, with some senior policy staff at the directors level told in pairs that only one or neither of them would be able to keep their jobs. UKHSA was launched with great fanfare by Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, in 2021, bringing together the former Public Health England, its successor, the National Institute for Health Protection, and NHS Test and Trace. Johnson had ordered the new body after losing faith with Public Health England’s handling of the pandemic during the first national lockdown. Asked about the plan to scale back testing further, UKHSA pointed to the ‘Living with Covid’ plan and said any decisions would be taken by ministers. A Department of Health and Social Care source said UKHSA submission had not been received yet but it would be looked at in the context of the Living with Covid plan. In response to the staff cuts, Paul Cain, director general for health protection operations, said: “In line with the government’s Living with Covid-19 plan we are adjusting the size of our workforce as was always planned. Temporary staff contracts are being brought to an end and those affected are being updated. At the same time, we will build new capability based on the lessons of Covid. “Those that joined NHS Test & Trace and Public Health England to manage the pandemic response played a crucial role and we thank them for their efforts once again.” The ‘Living with Covid’ plan does not refer to plans to cut back UKHSA, instead saying: “UKHSA will continue to lead the wider health protection emergency planning and response system, championing health security across the UK.”",News/Society,UK health agency to cut 40% of jobs and suspend routine Covid testing,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/uk-health-agency-to-cut-40-of-jobs-and-suspend-routine-covid-testing

It was first reported at 1pm but 20 fire engines and 120 crew remained at the scene in Creek Road, Deptford more than five hours later. The London fire brigade said 13 people had evacuated from the building and said there had been no reports of injuries. The cause of the fire is currently unknown. Station commander Ian Smith, of the LFB, said: “This is an intense fire located in the roof of the building and fire crews are working hard in challenging conditions. “There is a lot of smoke from the incident and we’d ask local residents to close their doors and windows.” Residents told the Press Association that building work was taking place on the block of flats at the time, with scaffolding visible around the walls of the building.",News/UK news,London: 120 firefighters fight ‘intense fire’ in Deptford block of flats,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/london-120-firefighters-fight-intense-fire-in-deptford-block-of-flats

4/27/2022,"A prominent Conservative peer withdrew her name from a key amendment to the borders bill, amid a “fierce whipping operation” to secure the controversial nationality and borders bill. The government was defeated three more times in the Lords, meaning a further potential standoff between peers and MPs including on asylum seekers’ right to work. The home secretary, Priti Patel, was among those personally lobbying Conservative peers on Tuesday night in a series of tight votes in the House of Lords that will see at least three amendments to the nationality and borders bill return to the Commons. Philippa Stroud, who was a key figure behind Conservative rebels’ failed efforts to force the government to reverse the £20-a-week universal credit cut, had tabled an amendment to give asylum seekers the right to work after six months. But sources in the Lords said Lady Stroud had been put under pressure – claiming she had been told she may lose the Conservative whip – and the amendment was eventually put in the name of Labour’s Ruth Lister. The amendment passed the Lords by a single vote. Peers described a major Tory whipping operation to try to secure the bill before recess, with Lords promised the opportunity to socialise in order to coax them to stay for late night voting. Despite three defeats, peers passed one of the bill’s most controversial measures, the offshoring of refugee claimants. At least 66 Tory MPs and peers had given their backing to the proposal, via a letter to the prime minister last month, urging a change to the bill to let asylum seekers work after six months, rather than a year. One senior Tory called the proposals in the bill “morally indefensible and economically illiterate” but said there was very little appetite from the government for compromise. Labour is facing a dilemma on whether to keep on with a “ping pong” of the bill, though sources said they were still hopeful of being able to force some concession before parliament is prorogued on Thursday. If Lords return the bill to the Commons yet again, MPs may be forced to sit next week to pass the bill. A Labour source in the Lords said: “We’re clearly hitting a brick wall with the home secretary who appears overly focused on ramming this legislation through and ignoring carefully thought-through advice from peers across the House about why aspects of this bill are unworkable.” Previously just two MPs, Simon Hoare and Tim Loughton, rebelled in the Commons when the amendment was returned to the Lords but more MPs, including the former cabinet minister Robert Buckland, have been working to try to reach a compromise. Current rules mean asylum seekers may be granted permission to work if a decision on their claim has been delayed for more than a year. Any job must be on the Home Office’s shortage occupation list until their claim is approved or rejected. Lords returned the nationality and borders bill to the Commons on Tuesday night, as part of the “ping-pong” on amendments that mean MPs will get another chance vote on amendments on Wednesday. The bill has suffered a string of 12 defeats in the Lords at the last debate. On Tuesday, peers debated six amendments including the right to work, new stringent conditions on “offshoring” refugees in the wake of the Rwanda proposal from the government, and removing the provisions that criminalise arrivals in the UK. Six amendments were put to peers on Tuesday night, with three defeated by the government including the offshore processing of refugees in Rwanda. One Tory said there was limited appetite for rebellion on that issue from centrist Tories and crossbenchers because there was a widespread belief the policy would never happen because of legal challenges or extraordinary costs. MPs will debate two other Lords amendments, one from Labour’s Shami Chakrabarti on refugee convention protection and one which would not disqualify refugees who made brief stopovers in other countries.",News/UK news,Tory peer withdraws name from key amendment to borders bill,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/tory-peer-withdraws-name-from-key-amendment-to-borders-bill
4/27/2022,"Formula One has attempted to forge ahead with its intent to increase the number of sprint races next season but their efforts have been prevented for the moment by the sport’s governing body, the FIA. At a meeting of the F1 Commission in London on Tuesday there was also no concrete decision regarding whether the budget cap would be increased this year. The F1 commission consists of representatives of F1’s owners – Formula One management, the FIA and the teams. F1 and the teams supported increasing the number of sprint race weekends to be held from the three this year to six next year, with FOM believing the format to be very successful. However the FIA has insisted it will not back the plan until it has carried out an evaluation of the impact of the proposal on its trackside operations and personnel. The FIA will then report back to the commission and once more consider the proposal. Reports have suggested the FIA was seeking to receive greater financial redress from F1 in return for agreeing to increasing the sprint races. The meeting also discussed the proposed budget cap increase from $140m (£111m) to $147m (£116m) this year to cover increased freight and logistic costs and inflation, a move that was known to be opposed by three teams. The matter has not been resolved and instead handed to the F1 financial working group which will investigate the issues involved and also present its findings at the next meeting of the commission. There was, however, agreement that in accordance with when the new engine rule set to come into play in 2026 the cars would have to adapt accordingly. The new engines are aimed at environmental sustainability – including an increase in the deployment of electrical power to up to 50% and to utilise a 100% sustainable fuel. There was agreement that with a potential loss in horsepower from the new power units the cars needed to be smaller and lighter, and that ways must be considered to reduce their drag while maintaining recent improvements in their ability to follow one another closely on track. The use of helmet cameras was given unanimous approval after their initial tests and they will be employed across the entire grid in 2023. There was no announcement on which race will replace the Russian Grand Prix but the subject was discussed with Qatar remaining an option or potentially a second race in Singapore.",Sport/Sport,FIA stalls on increasing the number of sprint races in F1 next season,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/fia-stalls-on-increasing-the-number-of-sprint-races-in-f1-next-season
4/27/2022,"A series of mysterious explosions in Moldova have raised the threat of Russia’s war in Ukraine spilling over into new territory, with unpredictable consequences. The blasts destroyed radio antennas in a Russian-garrisoned sliver of eastern Moldova along the Ukrainian border, Transnistria, which had been peaceful since a brief conflict in 1992 waged by Kremlin-backed separatists against the Moldovan army. The separatist authorities blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators while the Kyiv government alleged they were false-flag attacks designed to provide a pretext for an infusion of Russian troops, to add to the 1,500 already based there, just as similar blasts in the Donbas preceded the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. Those allegations were given greater weight when residents in Transnistria received fake SMS texts on Tuesday warning of an imminent Ukrainian attack. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, convened an emergency meeting of her security council and declared that forces were at play in Transnistria which were “interested in destabilising the region”. A Russian move into Transnistria would pose an imminent threat to the sovereignty of Moldova, a country of 2.6 million people which, like Ukraine, has shown increasing interest in joining Nato. It would also menace Odesa, the Ukrainian port city which lies on the Black Sea coast between Moldova and Russian-occupied Kherson. Four days ago the commander of Russia’s central military district, Rustam Minnekayev, said Moscow’s goals involved the seizure of southern Ukraine, so as to give Russia control over the Black Sea coast and access to Transnistria. On Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council and one of Vladimir Putin’s closest advisers, raised another grim specter, declaring that Ukraine could fragment into “several states”, blaming such an outcome on western intervention. The threat of dismemberment follows the humiliating failure of Putin’s primary war aim, to subjugate all of Ukraine and install a friendly government in Kyiv. The massive offensive launched in February was unable to break Ukrainian resistance while Moscow was unable to deter Nato support. Repeated Russian warnings, explicitly brandishing the world’s biggest nuclear arsenal, have had a diminishing impact. Finland and Sweden look set to declare their readiness to join Nato next month in time for the alliance summit at the end of June, shrugging off suggestions from Moscow that such a move would lead to the westward deployment of Russian forces, including nuclear missiles. On Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, tried amplifying the threat, accusing Nato of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine and warning that the danger of nuclear conflict “should not be underestimated.” But barely 12 hours later, Germany dropped its earlier escalatory reservations about supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine, and announced that it would be sending 50 Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns. That announcement, by the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, was made at Tuesday’s meeting of approximately 40 countries at Ramstein airbase, to coordinate and enhance western military support for Kyiv that marked a raising of the stakes by Ukraine’s backers. Announcing the UK’s own contribution of anti-aircraft systems, defence minister James Heappey went further, saying it would be “entirely legitimate” for the weapons to be used against supply lines inside Russia. In response Russia has started bombing the supply lines bringing in western arms, targeting railways and bridges and threatening to hit Kyiv. As the Ukraine war evolves, the parties to the conflict are redefining their aims. Russia has abandoned outright conquest for now, and is seeking to carve out a contiguous zone of occupation reaching as far as Transnistria, which Putin can package as “Novorossiya”, the foundation for a new Russian empire. The Biden administration meanwhile has emphatically confirmed that its objectives go beyond the defence of Ukraine to the hobbling of Russia’s capacity to carry out further acts of aggression. “What we want to see is a free and independent Ukraine and at the end of the day, that will involve a weakened Russia and strengthened Nato,” the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, told CNN, echoing remarks made by the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, the day before. “What’s at stake here is much greater than Ukraine,” Milley added. “If Russia gets away with this cost-free, so goes the so-called international world order and we enter an area of serious instability.” With the start of this new phase in the war, a layer is being stripped away from the buffer that has thus far kept Nato and Russia from coming into direct, hostile contact, during the cold war and since. And if the ominous explosions in Transnistria are auguries of a new Putin gambit, Moldova could find itself to be the next proving ground where this dangerous new world makes itself felt.",News/World news,Russia’s war in Ukraine threatens to spill over in dangerous new phase,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/russias-war-in-ukraine-threatens-to-spill-over-in-dangerous-new-phase
4/27/2022,"A teenager whose body was found on a Dorset clifftop after an 11-day search had been anxious about the imminent release from jail of a man she told police had raped her when she was 16, an inquest jury has heard. Gaia Pope was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after the alleged rape and was worried that the man she had accused was about to be freed. On the day she vanished, Pope, 19, from Swanage, had been due to make a formal complaint to police after being sent indecent images on social media. The jury in Bournemouth was told that Pope, a student, had been in the care of mental health professionals at a local NHS trust after the alleged rape, but was discharged to her GP a month before her death. Rachael Griffin, the senior coroner for Dorset, said that the impact of the alleged rape, her medical care, the way the search for her was conducted and her cause of death would be examined during the 11-week inquest. Griffin told the jury: “In December 2015, she disclosed to family she had been raped the previous year when she was 16. She reported it to police, the alleged perpetrator denied the allegation. “He was not charged or convicted of any offence relating to Gaia. Approximately a year later he was convicted of other sexual offences relating to other victims. The alleged perpetrator was due to be released in autumn 2017. At the time of her disappearance, Gaia was anxious about his imminent release.” Griffin told the inquest jury that it was not relevant for them to hear about the precise circumstances of the alleged rape or about the decision not to charge.“However it is relevant for you to hear about how upset Gaia was about the decision not to charge him and the impact of his imminent release on Gaia’s mental health,” she said. The jury heard that from 2015 to 2017, Pope underwent mental health assessments and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2016. On 22 October 2017, she was discharged from Dorset Healthcare University NHS foundation trust back to the care of her GP. On 2 November 2017, she reported to police that she had been sent indecent images on social media and was due to meet with police officers to make a formal complaint and statement on 7 November. She was at an aunt’s house that day but seemed “unsettled” and ran away at 3.40pm. The relative contacted police at 3.42pm, telling them Pope was having “some sort of episode” and expressed concerns for Gaia’s welfare. The last known sighting of her alive was captured by a CCTV camera in Swanage just before 4pm. The search for Gaia included the police, coastguard, the National Police Air Service and volunteers from Dorset Search & Rescue. Her body was finally found in undergrowth on a clifftop near Swanage on 18 November. In a statement issued before the hearing began, the family said: “There are no words for that kind of loss, particularly not when we hear from so many other survivors that they are still denied access to justice and support. “We need to know if more could have been done to protect Gaia, and so does our community who worked so tirelessly to find her. These are matters not just of our private grief, but of public concern.” The inquest continues.
