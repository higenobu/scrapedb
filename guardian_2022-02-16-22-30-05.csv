2/16/2022,"Protests are due to take place in Cambridge on Wednesday evening outside a gig performed by Jimmy Carr, in response to comments made by the comedian which have been described as racist and offensive towards Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. Cambridge Stand Up To Racism has organised for the demonstration to take place outside Corn Exchange, the venue where Carr is due to perform.  In a statement, the group said: “Challenging these remarks is particularly important in Cambridge which hosts a Travellers community which often receives adverse publicity and verbal abuse.” Anti-racist student groups will also join the protest. Carr’s comments have been condemned widely by groups such as the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial and Hope Not Hate. Downing Street has also said that the comments made by Carr were “deeply disturbing”. The comments were made during Carr’s His Dark Material show, which was released on Netflix on Christmas Day but received widespread attention this month after a clip went viral. In the clip, Carr said: “When people talk about the Holocaust, they talk about the tragedy and horror of 6 million Jewish lives being lost to the Nazi war machine. But they never mention the thousands of Gypsies that were killed by the Nazis. “No one ever wants to talk about that, because no one ever wants to talk about the positives.” Cambridge city council said in a statement that Carr’s management had confirmed that none of the content from the Netflix show would be used during his appearance on Wednesday. Councillor Anna Smith, the leader of Cambridge city council, said she shared the outrage felt by so many regarding Carr’s “unacceptable remarks”. “As a council, we are committed to working with and supporting marginalised communities, including our Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities. That is affirmed in our city’s equality pledge, which states our belief in the dignity of all people and their right to respect and equality of opportunity.” Yvonne MacNamara, the chief exectutive of the Traveller Movement, who released a joint statement with the leader of the city council, said: “It’s hard to overstress the hurt and distress these comments have caused. We welcome the stand taken by Cambridge city council and hope others will now follow suit.” She continued: “There are many still living who witnessed the brutality of what happened, and many more who lost their families. Making a joke of it is unacceptable. The Traveller Movement has called on Netflix, which aired the His Dark Material special containing the joke in December, to remove the gag and apologise.” Cambridge city council also confirmed that the Corn Exchange, the venue where Carr will be performing, will be lit up as a mark of solidarity with the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, and that leaflets will be distributed outside the venue about historic and present racism towards Traveller communities.",News/UK news,Cambridge protests to be held outside Jimmy Carr gig in response to Roma joke,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/cambridge-protests-to-be-held-outside-jimmy-carr-gig-in-response-to-roma-joke
2/16/2022,"The supreme court has ruled against Bloomberg News in a landmark privacy case that will make it harder for British media outlets to publish information about individuals subject to criminal investigations. In 2016 Bloomberg named an American business executive at a large public company who was facing a criminal inquiry by a British regulator. The article was based on a confidential letter Bloomberg had obtained, which revealed that the businessman was being investigated in relation to claims his company had been involved in corruption and bribery in a foreign country.  The businessman – known in the legal proceedings as ‘ZXC – decided to sue Bloomberg over the article, claiming that the media outlet had misused his private information as he had not been arrested or charged with any offence in relation to the corruption inquiry. The case hinged on how to balance the businessman’s right to privacy with Bloomberg’s right to freedom of expression. Following six years of legal argument and appeals, the British court system has conclusively sided with the businessman and dismissed the media outlet’s arguments. In the judgment written by Lord Hamblen and Lord Stephens, they said: “For some time, judges have voiced concerns as to the negative effect on an innocent person’s reputation of the publication that he or she is being investigated by the police or an organ of the state.” They said there is a “uniform general practice” by bodies such as the police not to identify those under investigation before charge due to the risk of unfair damage to their reputation. Hamblen and Stephens continued: “Reputational and other harm will ordinarily be caused to the individual by the publication of such information. “The degree of that harm depends on the factual circumstances, but experience shows that it can be profound and irremediable.” Wednesday’s supreme court ruling is the latest – and potentially most important – in a series of judgments which have strengthened privacy law in the UK. The ruling clearly establishes that individuals suspected of criminal wrongdoing have a reasonable expectation of privacy until charged. It also makes it harder for journalists to publish stories based on confidential documents, even if the leaked material alleges serious wrongdoing. British media outlets – both at the tabloid end of the market and in high-end financial news – increasingly find that privacy law, rather than the risk of libel, is one of the biggest barriers to publication of stories. In 2018 Cliff Richard successfully won substantial damages from the BBC after the broadcaster revealed that he was the subject of a police investigation into supposed historic sex offences, even though no charge was ever brought and the claims were later dismissed as false. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, also won a privacy case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after it published details of her personal letter to her father. Hanna Basha, of the law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said the British media will now be severely restricted in “how they are able to report on the early stages of the majority of criminal investigations”. “It is a welcome decision for those suspected of crimes who are subsequently not charged as they no longer have a reputational cloud hanging over their heads simply because of the investigation. If suspects are not charged then, in the majority of cases, no one will ever find out about the investigation.” The businessman in Wednesday’s ruling successfully argued that, under the European Convention on Human Rights, he had a reasonable expectation that the details of the British regulator’s criminal investigation into him would not be made public unless he was charged with an offence. Bloomberg had argued that the general public understands that reporting the existence of a criminal investigation into an individual does not mean they are necessarily guilty of a criminal offence. However, the supreme court ruled that even revealing the existence of a criminal inquiry will affect aspects of an individual’s private life such as “the right to establish and develop relationships with other people”. Bloomberg also argued that the businessman’s work for a major company listed on the stock exchange should not be considered part of his private life and therefore should not be subject to the same legal protections. The court rejected this interpretation of the right to a private life and instead went the opposite way, concluding that an article revealing the existence of a criminal inquiry would cause “greater damage to a businessman actively involved in the affairs of a large public company” than to an ordinary member of the public. As a result the supreme court also upheld an earlier decision to award £25,000 in damages to ZXC for misuse of his private information.",News/Media,Bloomberg loses UK supreme court case on privacy,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/16/bloomberg-loses-uk-supreme-court-case-on-privacy
2/16/2022,"Heineken has said beer prices will go up as it faces “crazy increases” in the cost of ingredients, energy and transport. The brewer said inflation was “off the charts” and its costs would increase by about 15%, forcing it to charge more – which could lead to lower beer consumption.  Dolf van den Brink, the brewer’s chief executive, told the Financial Times: “In my 24 years in the business I’ve never seen anything like it, not even close. Across the board we are faced with crazy increases.” He added: “There’s no model that can handle this kind of inflation. It’s kind of off the charts.” He said the company’s speed of recovery from the pandemic remained uncertain as it was difficult to judge what impact the price increases would have on the amount of beer it sold, while Covid-19 was expected to continue affecting trade. The latest warning on inflation comes as Heineken said the price of beer it sold was up an average 4.3% in Europe in 2021, partly because of a shift to more premium beers and the reopening of bars and pubs, as well as like-for-like price increases. In the UK, beer sales rose by about 5% driven by the group’s premium Birra Moretti and Desperados brands. Low-and non-alcoholic drink sales increased by more than 30%, led by the continued success of Heineken 0.0. Overall, Heineken reported an 11.3% increase in sales to €21.9bn in 2021, while its net profit jumped by 80% to €2bn. The volume of beer sold increased by 4.6% over the year, buoyed up by a 6.2% rise over the final three months as it benefited from reduced restrictions in Europe. Van den Brink said Heineken had produced a “strong set of results” in “a challenging and fast-changing environment”. “Looking ahead, although the speed of recovery remains uncertain and we face significant inflationary challenges, we are encouraged by the strong performance of our business,” he said.",News/Business,"‘Off the charts’ inflation will force beer prices to go up, Heineken warns",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/16/off-the-charts-inflation-will-force-beer-prices-to-go-up-heineken-warns
2/16/2022,"Martin McKeand, who has died aged 86 of bacterial pneumonia, went from the glossy, commercial world of advertising to become producer of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, one of the grittiest television programmes of the 1980s, reflecting the haves-and-have-nots polarised world under Margaret Thatcher’s government. He was already producing documentaries for ITV when it hired him to make the new comedy-drama, featuring seven builders finding work in Germany as unemployment soared in Britain. “It’s also about the insularity of the British abroad,” said McKeand, “blokes living in prison-hut conditions on German building sites unable to relate to anything or anybody around them.”  Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, previously known for sitcoms such as The Likely Lads and Porridge, wrote most of the scripts, from stories devised by Franc Roddam, based on the experiences of Mick Connell, a Stockton-on-Tees bricklayer. McKeand, a hands-on producer, was influenced in the casting by seeing the director Ken Loach’s 1981 film Looks and Smiles, about unemployment – set in Sheffield, with local non-professional actors in the lead roles. Seeking to recreate some of this social realism, McKeand sat in on auditions with the director, Roger Bamford, and Barry Ford, casting director of Central Independent Television, which co-produced the series with Witzend Productions. They agreed on Tim Healy and Kevin Whately to play the philosophising Dennis and the ever-homesick Neville, but were stuck on the casting for Oz, the tough character inspired by Connell. Their problem was solved when Jimmy Nail, who had a broken nose and several missing teeth, walked into the auditions. The septet was completed by Timothy Spall as the boring Brummie electrician Barry, Gary Holton as the womanising cockney carpenter Wayne, Pat Roach as the Bristolian bricklayer and ex-wrestler Bomber, and Christopher Fairbank as the Liverpudlian plasterer Moxey. It was a complicated production. While a construction site, complete with cranes, dumper trucks, portable toilets and thousands of bricks imported from Germany, was built at Elstree studios, location filming was done in Hamburg, doubling as Düsseldorf. And McKeand had to cope with the cast’s high jinks. Long drinking sessions in the hotel bar led to rowdiness and visits from the police, and the night porter once objected when one cast member brought a sex worker back. “I was called into the hotel manager’s office,” recalled McKeand in an article for the programme’s official fansite. He was told: “In our country, people who make films are artists, civilised people. This does not seem to be true of some of your group. I must ask you to leave.” McKeand’s diplomacy saved the day. He set about keeping his rabble-rousers in order for the rest of the shoot. McKeand felt that the series (1983-84) was under-publicised by Central, but when viewing figures hit almost 14 million, it commissioned a second run, set in Spain and screened in 1986. The producer’s problems this time included working around industrial action at home by the TV electricians’ union and a rainy Costa del Sol during filming in Marbella. Even more challenging was the task of completing the series following the death of Holton in October 1985 from an alcohol and morphine overdose. With all location shooting finished, a double was used and scripts were rewritten. Although he was not involved in a later Auf Wiedersehen, Pet revival for the BBC (2002-04), McKeand was proud to have launched Nail’s career and produced him again in the first two series (1991-92) of the hugely popular Spender, with Nail playing the unorthodox undercover Newcastle detective sergeant, Freddie Spender. Born in Sutton, Surrey, Martin was the son of Joan (nee ten Bruggenkate) and Jay (James) McKeand, who worked in insurance. He attended the City of London school before doing national service with the Royal Army Service Corps in Egypt. After entering the advertising industry in 1955 as a media buyer with Young & Rubicam, he graduated to producer, then worked for several other companies. He joined Brooks Fulford in 1970, becoming its managing director the following year, and helped to create the Smash instant mashed potato commercials with Martian robots and the slogan: “For mash, get Smash.” Keen to break into television, he was eventually commissioned by the ITV company ATV to produce Havoc (1978), a documentary series about disasters, and the feature-length drama Dirty Money (1979), starring Ian McShane in the real-life story of French neo-fascists committing a bank robbery to finance their terrorist activities. McKeand then became embroiled in the diplomatic row that followed the screening of Death of a Princess (1980), the drama-documentary he co-produced with the director Antony Thomas, for which he had helped to raise funding from half a dozen countries. After seeing its re-enactment of the public executions of a Saudi royal and her male lover, Saudi Arabia imposed sanctions and ejected Britain’s ambassador from Riyadh. The programme-makers also had to fight off attacks from Conservative politicians in parliament – and critics who condemned the drama-documentary style. Between making Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and Spender, McKeand was Saatchi & Saatchi’s deputy head of television advertising (1988-89). He returned to TV to produce another comedy-drama by Clement and La Frenais, Full Stretch (1993), starring Kevin McNally as a former footballer running a struggling limousine-hire company, and the first series of Harry (1993), with Michael Elphick as an unscrupulous news agency reporter. McKeand’s 1965 marriage to Lorna Heaton ended in divorce. He then had a long-term relationship with Jill Forbes, who died in 2001. He is survived by the two children of his marriage, Kate and Richard, his stepson, Alex, and his sister, Janet.

2/16/2022,"Imagine if, two years after resigning amid the Watergate scandal, Richard Nixon had run for president again. It’s not a perfect analogy for the current state of US soccer politics, but it’s close. Two years after resigning in the wake of a legal filing that claimed female players had less ability than their male counterparts, Carlos Cordeiro is running for his old gig as president of US Soccer.  The election will take place on 5 March. And Cordeiro has a legitimate shot against incumbent Cindy Parlow Cone, the Hall of Fame player and NWSL champion coach who was elevated from vice-president after Cordeiro’s departure. It is fair to say not everyone is happy at the prospect of his return. He’s going to run and likely going to win and US Soccer will be garbage because of it. In what world does his return improve the game, men’s or women’s, in the US? He’s proven himself unable to lead and Goldman Sachs alum running football in the US has never been a good idea. https://t.co/syDT1vew6t If casual fans who aren’t well versed in US Soccer’s labyrinthine politics are surprised, they’re not alone. “I couldn’t believe it,” says Alan Rothenberg, who oversaw World Cup 1994, the launch of Major League Soccer and the early organization of the 1999 Women’s World Cup during his eight years as federation president. “I don’t know what he’s thinking. When you think about how he left in disgrace, what he failed to accomplish, how he set the federation back – how could he think he’d be welcomed back?” To answer that question, it’s important to remember that US Soccer isn’t just the overseer of the men’s and women’s national teams, writing paychecks to Christian Pulisic and Christen Press. Its mandate is to grow the game at all levels and in all its forms. Its constituents include the feuding factions in youth soccer, organizations for disability sports, and the largest group, the state associations charged with minding the sport at its grassroots in the US. The latter are Cordeiro’s biggest supporters. Cordeiro says figures within US Soccer have approached him with a laundry list of concerns, ranging from youth programs to the federation’s status within Fifa. Some state associations think Cone went overboard with budget cuts, particularly to the grassroots, in the wake of Covid and has not paid heed to their concerns. “Cindy’s cuts to youth programs and grants were extreme,” says Dave Guthrie, executive director of Indiana Soccer. “It’s as if the grassroots didn’t even matter to Cindy.” For her part, Cone says some decisions were made specifically for the Covid era, and funding will return to many areas as we emerge from the pandemic. “We all had to make really hard decisions, both on programming and personnel,” Cone says. “One of the things we did was shifting our Innovate to Grow grant program to Covid relief so members could apply for Covid relief during that time. We’ve now shifted it back, and it’s fully funded for all of our non-professional members.” Another issue that grated on the states is voting representation. Congress passed legislation requiring federations like US Soccer to give athletes one-third of the voting power, up from 20%. The US Olympic and Paralympic Committee amended its bylaws accordingly. US Soccer had little choice in how to adapt to the new rules, but some states still harbor resentment. Meanwhile, the backlash to a Cordeiro candidacy has been severe. Some major players in US soccer are outraged that Cordeiro would consider himself the best choice to fix any federation issues after his own tenure. “So much of that happened under your watch, buddy,” says Julie Foudy, a Hall of Famer who played with Cone on the national team. “She’s actually trying to clean up your mess.” NWSL Players Association executive director Meghann Burke sees a correlation between the condescending legal briefs that brought down Cordeiro and the systemic abuse of women’s players from youth level to the pros that was brought to light in 2021 and continues to unfold. “The president of the governing body of our sport needs to be as dedicated as the players are to making the game safer and better for everyone,” Burke says. “Those briefs tell us everything we need to know about whether Carlos Cordeiro shares our commitment.” Cordeiro, of course, didn’t write the legal briefs in question, and the team that came up with them were pushed out along with Cordeiro himself. But one factor in that quagmire was a lack of leadership among US Soccer staff. The president is an unpaid volunteer, not a CEO. The longtime CEO, Dan Flynn, announced his retirement early in Cordeiro’s tenure. The process to replace him, as well as the men’s national team coach, proceeded at a glacial pace “As president, I worked closely with the board to put a search process in place, including hiring an outside search firm [for CEO],” Cordeiro says. “When that initial search did not produce the results we wanted, we brought in a second firm to continue the search. We were determined to find the absolute best person to help lead the federation into the future.” That’s far from the only complaint against Cordeiro during his reign. Rothenberg points to a “needless fight” with the US Soccer Foundation charity. The charity has broken its own precedent during this presidential campaign by endorsing Cone, who moved quickly to settle the lawsuit between the two entities. Meanwhile Ricardo Fort, a consultant who led global sponsorship efforts for Visa and Coca-Cola, wrote a blistering piece saying Cordeiro damaged relationships with sponsors that were only resolved when Cone effectively assembled a new management team to repair the damage. And these are the parts of the job at which Cordeiro is supposed to excel. He’s a Goldman Sachs alumnus whose business and financial acumen added to his appeal as a candidate when he won the 2018 election. “How well did that business background serve him when he actually had that job?” Foudy says. Rothenberg also scoffs at Cordeiro’s signature accomplishment: ensuring the success of the joint USA-Mexico-Canada bid for the 2026 World Cup. “You or I could’ve gotten that awarded,” he says. In the public-facing parts of the job, Cordeiro was never at ease. At a victory parade following the USWNT’s victory at the 2019 World Cup, he exacerbated the tension around the equal pay lawsuit between the team and federation with badly timed comments about the US investing more in women’s soccer than any country in the world. It was not an outlandish statement, but neither was it the sort of thing to say when the focus should have been on the players and coaches. To top it off, he mispronounced the name of Megan Rapinoe, the team’s most prominent player. To be sure, the women’s lawsuit stokes some resentment among the rank and file. But Cone, as a distinguished women’s player and coach, is uniquely positioned to plead US Soccer’s case without coming across as an out-of-touch mansplainer. She has overseen a partial settlement in the case and deftly recast the debate to focus on what US Soccer says would be a financial catastrophe if the women win their case on appeal, saying a payout would “likely bankrupt the federation.” That claim might be slightly overstated, but anyone who has done the accounting can see that a payout of $67m, the back pay calculated by an expert witness for the women’s team, would necessitate major cuts in the development programs for future generations that the states rightly hold dear. Cone also called the men’s national team’s bluff when it comes to their statements backing the USWNT. She urged both teams to come to the table to figure out a fair deal that somehow accounts for the wild disparities in prize money that Fifa awards to the winners of the men’s and women’s World Cups. While Cordeiro has the states associations’ support, he will struggle elsewhere. The Professional Council has 20% of the vote, and it’s difficult to imagine MLS alienating sponsors, or the NWSL alienating its players with a Cordeiro vote. The Athletes Council has 33.3% of the vote and swung the election for Cordeiro in 2018. But it isn’t likely to support him again, at least not unanimously. The 23-person council has 12 women, including recent national team stalwarts Becky Sauerbrunn, Ali Krieger and Alex Morgan. Cordeiro, though, is seizing the initiative. While he agrees that the federation would struggle to pay its bills if it acceded to the USWNT’s pay demands, he pledges a capital campaign for a one-time payment to settle the suit. He also wants to push for a National Training Center and a bid to host the 2027 Women’s World Cup, which could be a difficult sell given that the US is already hosting the men’s tournament in 2026 and the 2028 Olympics. But then again, Cordeiro was underestimated in 2018. He could pull off the upset once again. And a lot of important people in soccer would be upset.

2/16/2022,"Struggling to adjust as pandemic restrictions end? Don’t worry, Tim Key has created a “cheeky little locky-D” in Soho theatre and we’re all invited. He paces the room in a blue velour tracksuit, as the audience files into his pseudo-flat, a shabby front door to the left of us, a magnet-covered fridge to the right. It is brave to dedicate an entire show to Covid-19 lockdowns. During them, livestreamed comedy gigs were naturally packed with Covid content – increasingly familiar stuff about video calls, social distancing and home-based hobbies. To extract an hour of solid, even surprising, laughs from such well-trodden ground requires skill. Key delivers with his trademark knowing grin.  Key is probably best known for irreverent, surreal poetry (on stage, on Radio 4 and in print) and being the shambolic yet prideful auteur who delivers it. Fans will not be disappointed. “Who here did lockdown?” he bellows. In March 2020, Key had “voiceovers coming out my arse … Pointless Celebrities sniffing around”, when lockdown arrived. “My fame falling off me like slow-cooked lamb dribbling from a shin,” he laments. Mulberry is “the story of a celebrity sealed away”, charting Key’s professional crisis, through an escalating thirst for craft beer and surprise appearances on TV quizshows. His lockdown companion, a five-foot teddy bear, stars in a handful of the funniest punchlines, while mentions of his past glories become a pleasing refrain. Key’s gift, the reason his shows always have great pace, is his poetry. He balances the swift and silly (“‘Get your jabs, you useless cunts!’ No one had ever seen the Queen like this before”), with more languorous, even poignant, prose. Whenever we veer towards pandemic tropes, there’s a poem to redirect us. His onstage persona (crumpled clothing, lager, anger) is established enough that he can play with it. Lockdown has replaced his customary suit with loungewear. He’s softer than in previous shows; he bonds with an audience member. It is part of Mulberry’s unfolding narrative: lockdown may have crushed dreams of becoming “a household name”, but being back on stage, “the poet” once again, is where he belongs.

2/16/2022,"We are living in the age of the nonagenarian: the Queen continues to gain popularity against her elected officials, and Rupert Murdoch has been given everything he’s ever asked for, just a few weeks from his 91st birthday. In between meetings in Saudi Arabia, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, announced the removal of legal restrictions designed to prevent the media mogul from interfering in the editorial independence of the Times and the Sunday Times, hurdles put in place by Margaret Thatcher when he bought the newspapers in 1981.  Murdoch has long railed against these restrictions, which he described as state interference, but which allowed him to avoid a deal-busting referral. It took until July 2019 for his complaints to gain any traction, the same month Boris Johnson became prime minister. This shows how much has changed in the past decade: I was told that when Murdoch’s directors wanted to discuss these restrictions after the phone-hacking scandal, they were rebuffed. Now he has got what he wanted all along. Having weathered scandal and breakup, Murdoch really is like the fictional character he is most often compared to; like Succession’s Logan Roy, he is not just still standing at the end of season three, but continuing to win. Murdoch’s strength stands in marked contrast to the prime minister, a former journalist once sacked by a Murdoch publication for falsifying a quote, who suddenly needs his friends in the media more than ever. The revolving door between Downing Street and Fleet Street has already seen Johnson’s director of communications become deputy editor-in-chief of the Sun, a paper which failed to break any major “partygate” stories. Some publications featured extensive stories and headlines about the partying prime minister, while others – particularly on the Sun, the Express and the Mail – have struggled to get these stories on their own front pages. When David Davis called for his leader to go, the Mail harangued Johnson’s critics by splashing with the headline “In the name of God, grow up”, while announcing that the latest Johnson baby was recovering from Covid. The Times and particularly the Sunday Times have not acted like tabloid fanboys the latest controversies. Even the Telegraph has reported on the signs of distress in the Conservative party. But the angle papers take on the day’s news is not the only sign of how a relationship is working. In the first 14 months of his premiership, Johnson met Murdoch three times, for one “general discussion” and two social events. Johnson’s sister, Rachel, had to backtrack from a throwaway line she made about Murdoch asking the prime minister to “get rid of the BBC while dandling his baby son Wilfred on his knee at Chequers”. The problem with this joke was that the image seemed so plausible that the story still lives without a disclaimer three months on. Murdoch’s closeness to politicians of all persuasions is no surprise; he came in through the back door at Downing Street to meet prime ministers from David Cameron to Gordon Brown. But his meetings with Johnson have been surprisingly numerous, particularly given the fact that for some of the time Murdoch was of an age to be shielding. He also had dinner with Michael Gove, a favourite former Times journalist, lunch with the chancellor and a “lunch with friends” with Jacob Rees-Mogg. These encounters are not minuted, of course, which only leaves us to ponder what exactly was discussed. Murdoch has always offered assurances that his titles will remain free of his influence, like when he appointed an independent board to oversee the Wall Street Journal. Someone described these arrangements to me as “eye candy for governments”. The six similarly independent directors of Times Newspapers Ltd, paid about £15,000 each a year, meet the editors of the daily and Sunday titles every three months and write a report to parliament. The only time in recent memory they disagreed with an appointment – when John Witherow moved from the Sunday to daily title – the objections were eased with further meetings and a six-month delay. Besides, the kind of seven-day operation the two papers can now institute is already working for most newspaper groups. But fig leaf or not, this 1981 agreement is now going to end. Murdoch is on record as saying that he has “never guaranteed anyone support of my newspapers”, but that doesn’t stop politicians trying to win it. At the same time as shamefully giving status to online slurs about a child abuse scandal to attack his political opponent, Johnson also falsely claimed that Keir Starmer “used his time prosecuting journalists” – not only wrong, but a sure sign that Johnson is on the side of News Corp over the phone-hacking scandal. Johnson, who made a career out of tendentious journalism, appears to be continuing the trick while leading the country. Just write or say anything to get you out of a hole and get important people to like you. He has been found to have lied and made mistakes, and his biggest critics to date are Conservatives like John Major and Michael Heseltine, worried about the impact on all political reputations in the same way all journalists are tarred when some lie or misbehave. The lesson from Murdoch is that sitting out the bad times and waiting for the good times to return could work. The problem is that with trust in politics and media at an all-time low, most of us don’t have that luxury.

2/16/2022,"He had promised to “risk it for the biscuit” and while Dave Ryding ended up with crumbs in his fourth and final Olympics, he promised he had no regrets. “It’s been a hell of a journey,” he said after his 13th-place finish in the men’s slalom, sporting a smile that could have lit up Beijing.  The popular 35-year-old, who learned his trade on a dry slope in Lancashire where wandering sheep and their slippy excrement were a frequent hazard, has developed into one of the world’s best alpine skiers. But a mistake while leading on his first run cost him the best part of a second and any chance he had of finishing his career with an Olympic medal. “I started great in the first run and lost the rhythm,” he admitted. “My second run I knew that I wasn’t quite flowing enough. You can feel it when you’re skiing. It felt more like a struggle than a flow. I gave it what I had. which I always do, so I can’t be too disappointed. It was just what it was today.” Ryding believes he has another year at the top - and after that wants to help bring through the next wave of British skiers. “If you can make it affordable you can keep more people in the sport, keep a bigger pool of athletes going through,” he said, although he admitted he wasn’t quite sure of the finer details of his grand plan. “I’m not being selfish but I still have a career to finish,” he added. “I still have to put all my energy into that, I don’t know how we will do it yet, but if they want help, I will give it.” As he spoke, the Frenchman Clement Noel was celebrating a brilliant gold medal, following a second run that was 0.99 sec quicker than first round leader Johannes Strolz of Austria. Not that Stolz was complaining. He collected a silver to go with his Alpine combined event - a staggering achievement given that last summer the 29-year-old thought his career as a top skier might be over and had started working with his local police force. “I have to talk to coaches of the Austrian ski team and we have to make a good plan for the upcoming season, and then I will see how much time is left for some police work,” he joked. With just four days left of a desperately disappointing Winter Games for Britain, Team GB’s chances of a medal appear to come down to the curling. The men’s team, led by Bruce Mouat, look the best bet and have already qualified for the semi-finals. However, Britain’s women continue to oscillate between the sublime and the below average, and a surprise 8-5 defeat to China on Wednesday means that they need other results to go their way to make the final four.",Sport/Sport,Team GB’s Dave Ryding misses out on slalom medal but signs off with a smile,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/16/winter-olympics-team-gb-skiing-dave-ryding
2/16/2022,"All children aged between five and 11 will be offered a Covid vaccine in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. Scotland follows a similar decision by Wales on Tuesday. Both governments say they have received “draft” advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which has been accepted.  The Pfizer vaccine was approved as safe and effective for children by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in December. But the JCVI previously only recommended the vaccine to vulnerable five to 11-year-olds. Millions of children aged between five and 11 have been vaccinated in other countries worldwide such as the US and across Europe. We’d like to hear from parents across the UK about their views on vaccinations for children aged 5-11. What is your reaction to the move in Scotland and Wales? Will you be vaccinating your children?

2/16/2022,"A groundbreaking attempt to make Iranian and Syrian military officials answerable for war crimes they may have committed in Syria is being launched, as part of an effort to have the cases brought before the international criminal court. The request includes evidence of Syrian victims forced to flee into Jordan due to attacks and intimidation by the Syrian government and Iran-backed militia groups. It is being brought by the US-based Iran Human Rights Documentation Center in conjunction with Haydee Dijkstal, a UK barrister.  The victims, including Syrian journalists, were targeted between 2011 and 2018 for their professional journalistic activities and for their actual and perceived opposition activities. They come from predominantly Sunni towns and cities in Syria that the Alawite Assad regime and Shia Islamic Republic of Iran, which backed numerous militia groups in Syria, perceived as opposed. It marks the first time Iranian officials have been targeted in this way for their activity in Syria, and is part of a growing effort to make Syrian army officers and others legally accountable for their actions either at the ICC or in national European courts, including in Germany and France. Progress on the issue at the UN is largely impossible owing to the threat of a Russian veto. Gissou Nia, a lawyer on the legal team making the request, said: “Up until now, little public attention has been paid to the legal responsibility of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the decade-long Syrian conflict, despite the significant intervention of Iranian officials in Syria and perpetration of atrocities. “The Islamic Republic of Iran has provided a vast range of military and non-military support to achieve its objectives, chiefly to prevent the fall of disgraced Syrian president Bashar al-Assad at any cost. Unfortunately, that goal has been fought at the cost of hundreds of thousands of killed, injured and displaced Syrian civilians.” Syria is not a party to the ICC’s Rome Statute, but it is argued the ICC has jurisdiction because the victims fled into Jordan, which is a state party. Evidence has been provided anonymously because of fears of reprisals but the identities of those making complaints will be known to the ICC, which now has to make a preliminary decision prior to launching an investigation. There is no deadline by which the ICC must decide. The Syrian civilians, the claim suggests, felt forced to flee in the face of indiscriminate bombardments and shootings, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest and detention, beatings and other abuses, search operations and violent repression of the right to free expression including civilian reporters and activists. It says Iran-backed militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah, the Liwa Fatemiyoun (an Afghan Shia militia led by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Liwa Abu Fadl Al-Abbas attacked their towns and cities alongside armed forces of the Syrian government. The evidence being submitted on Wednesday to the ICC documents how the Syrians were forced to leave their homes and their families, and have been unable to return to their country. Article 7(1)(d) of the Rome Statute grants the court jurisdiction over the crime against humanity of “deportation or forcible transfer of population”, meaning the “forced displacement of the persons concerned by expulsion or other coercive acts from the area in which they are lawfully present, without grounds permitted under international law”. In a previous case in 2018, the ICC found it had jurisdiction over the Rohingya people when they were forced to flee into Bangladesh refugee camps from Myanmar. Bangladesh, unlike Myanmar, is a party to the ICC.",News/World news,Human rights lawyers attempt to bring Syria war crimes cases to ICC,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/human-rights-lawyers-attempt-to-bring-syria-war-crimes-cases-to-icc
2/16/2022,"Scotland and Wales have announced that they will offer Covid-19 vaccines to all 5-11 year olds, and the UK government is expected to announce a decision for England imminently. Northern Ireland has not yet followed suit. Britain has been slower than some other countries in offering the shots to this age group, so far only vaccinating vulnerable younger children.  Many EU member states began offering vaccination to all children aged five to 11 in December, but progress has been patchy, with authorities blaming hesitancy among parents and some doctors as well as mixed messaging from experts. Spain, whose vaccination campaign is one of the bloc’s most successful – nearly 83% of the population is double jabbed, against an EU average of 71.7% (and 71.4% in the UK) – has given 56% of five- to 11-year-olds a first dose and is moving on to second doses. Experts note that the pace of this rollout is slower than that of the adult vaccination programme, with an average of about 3,000 children a day being jabbed over the past week. “There’s no denying people have become weary with the pandemic, there are doubts among parents, contradictory messages from some experts and a perception that the risks are lower for children and young people,” Amós García, of the Spanish Vaccinology Association, told El País last week. Denmark has given about 47% of younger children at least one dose. Other countries are advancing more slowly. Barely 22% of younger children have been jabbed in Italy, compared with more than 80% of those aged 12 to 19. Roberto Burioni, a professor of microbiology and virology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan, said it was important for health authorities to continue to “push for a higher rate among children, since they spread the virus”. Germany’s vaccination regulator recommends jabs against Covid-19 for all children aged 12 to 17, more than 60% of whom are fully vaccinated, but in the five to 11 cohort it has advised vaccination only for those with pre-existing health conditions. Younger children without underlying conditions can get vaccinated if their parents wish, but there is no explicit recommendation. Of 5.3 million children in the five to 11 age group in Germany, only 13.6% have had at least one shot of vaccine so far. France, which is also in the EU’s leading group for vaccination in adults and older children, with more than 77% of the total population double jabbed, has made even slower progress with younger children: less than 5% have received a first dose. “The individual benefit for children is so significant that we really have to go much further, much faster, much stronger” the health minister, Olivier Véran, said this month during a video conference with family doctors and paediatricians. Experts point to hesitancy among parents, with opinion polls showing as many as 60% of those with younger children are reluctant to vaccinate five- to 11-year-olds. Official messaging in the first wave of the pandemic that children were not at serious risk from the virus and did not play a role in spreading it has not helped. Throughout France’s recent double coronavirus wave – fuelled by the Delta and Omicron variants – children have often been the most infected age group and schools the greatest single source of contamination. While they remain at far lower risk of serious illness or death than adults, more than 7% of all six- to 10-year-olds in France were infected with coronavirus every week in January and early February, data shows, and more than 100 children aged nine and under were in intensive care with Covid-19. “We need to urgently review the messaging,” said Sydney Sebban, a paediatrician. “Convince parents that Omicron is absolutely not anodyne, that unvaccinated children can develop very severe forms, and that even if they have had Covid, getting vaccinated gives them longer-term protection against a future variant.” A few EU countries have decided not to offer vaccines to younger children. Sweden’s health agency announced at the end of last month that it had decided against recommending vaccines for five- to 11-year-olds because it said the benefits did not outweigh the risks. “With the knowledge we have today, a low risk for serious disease for kids, we don’t see any clear benefit,” said an agency official, Britta Bjorkholm, adding that the decision would be reviewed if the data changed or a new variant emerged, and that children in high-risk groups would still be advised to get vaccinated. Outside Europe, the US has vaccinated about 10 million five- to 11-year-olds. The Food and Drug Administration has delayed until April a decision on whether to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech shot for children between six months and four years of age, saying it wanted to wait for more data from clinical trials.
