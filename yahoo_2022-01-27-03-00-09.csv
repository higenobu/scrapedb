1/27/2022,"A teacher went viral with a TikTok showing how she put hockey pucks under desks in her class. She said she decided to do it so students could throw them at a potential school shooter. An expert told Insider that he understood why the teacher did it but said the tactic could send a ""troubling"" message. A Michigan teacher amassed over 2 million views on a TikTok video where she showed how she taped hockey pucks under her students' desks, so they could throw them at a potential school shooter, but one expert told Insider the tactic could send a ""troubling"" message to students. In the video, Carly Zacharias, who teaches Spanish to 9th and 10th grade students, said she wanted to give her students ""something to prepare themselves"" in case of a school shooting because her classroom door is made of wood and has a window in the middle. Zacharias deleted the video on Tuesday, telling Insider: ""I think my boss wanted me to."" She said she decided to plant hockey pucks within reach underneath every desk because they can ""really hurt somebody,"" and that ""it definitely makes us feel a little bit better."" Zacharias told Insider she'd gotten ""mixed responses"" to the viral video but said most were positive. The clip, posted at the beginning of January, had amassed over 400,000 likes before it was removed, with many commenters expressing sadness and frustration that such a precaution would even be necessary. She said a student from Michigan's Oxford High School — where four people were killed and seven others were injured in a November shooting — thanked her for ""being proactive"" and giving her students more than the ""typical"" supplies. Zacharias said her own students were grateful that their classroom is ""a little bit safer than most of the others."" Hockey pucks were previously provided to students and faculty members as a defense mechanism against school shooters at Oakland University in Michigan in 2018, according to CNN. Speaking about Oakland University's hockey puck measure in 2018, the school's Police Chief, Mark Gordon, told the local news channel WXYZ that throwing a puck at a gunman ""would probably cause some injury"" and ""would be a distraction if nothing else."" David Schonfeld, the Director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, told Insider that instituting a measure like this could suggest to students they have ""a high risk of an active shooter coming into their classroom,"" which could be a ""troubling"" message ""for a number of kids"" and is ""not accurate."" The Washington Post in 2018 reported the statistical likelihood of a public school student in the US being killed by gunfire at school was roughly 1 in 614,000,000 since 1999. Still, anxieties about school shooting are high. According to 2018 data from the PEW Research Center, 57% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 said they were at least somewhat worried about a school shooting. Schonfeld said the hockey pucks could lead students to not ""flee as quickly"" or take other preventative measures, since they'd be focused on the puck. ""Someone with an assault weapon being stopped by a child with a hockey puck, or even 30 children with a hockey puck, is probably stacked more toward the advantage of the person with the assault weapon,"" he said, adding that he wouldn't recommended the tactic although he can ""understand why an educator might consider it."" Still, he said the ""bigger issue"" is adults need to speak to children about their anxieties related to school shootings. Some experts have raised alarms about active-shooter trainings in schools, and said they worry certain types of drills meant to prepare students actually traumatize them. Melissa Reeves, a professor at Winthrop University and the former president of the National Association of School Psychologists, told NPR in 2019 that certain types of active-shooter trainings create a ""sensorial experience, which really heightens all of our senses."" ""And what these drills can really do is potentially trigger either past trauma or trigger such a significant physiological reaction that it actually ends up scaring the individuals instead of better preparing them to respond in these kinds of situations,"" she said.

1/27/2022,"Former President Donald Trump suggested during a round of golf that he’s really driving toward a presidential bid in 2024. (Watch the video below.) In a widelyreported clip that appears to show Trump playing at one of his clubs, a partner introduces him on the tee as the “45th president of the United States.” To which Trump replies: “Forty-fifth and 47th.” He drew claps and cheers from people off-camera before hitting his drive. Trump’s office didn’t immediately answer HuffPost’s questions about the footage. Trump has repeatedly hinted he’ll run for another term, but declaring himself the 47th president would be the strongest indication yet of his impending candidacy. He dominates the Republican Party and leads polls of potential 2024 GOP contenders, despite the Capitol insurrection fueled by his continuing lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him, plus ongoing investigations of him and his family. In a Politico/Morning Consult poll on Wednesday, Trump trailed President Joe Biden by 1 percentage point in a possible election matchup. If Trump on a golf course seems familiar, maybe it’s because he played at least 289 times while president. Many of his outings were to his own resorts, which allowed him to profit from his leisure. He left taxpayers footing the bill for more than $151.5 million in travel and security costs for his hobby, HuffPost has reported. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/27/2022,"Mars Wrigley is closing a nearly century-old chocolate plant on Chicago’s West Side once hailed as the most beautiful candy factory in America. Built in a Spanish-style architecture in 1928, the sprawling plant in the Galewood neighborhood bordering Oak Park employs about 280 workers and will be phased out over the next two years, the company said in a statement Tuesday. What becomes of the employees and the unique factory — an intriguing part of Chicago’s rich candy history — remains to be seen. “The company remains committed to the city of Chicago and intends to partner with the surrounding community on a future vision for the site,” a spokesperson for Mars Wrigley Confectionery said in an email. “As we continuously evaluate our footprint across North America, our Associates were informed of the decision to move the majority of operations to other facilities in the U.S. over the next two years.” The U.S. headquarters for privately held Mars Wrigley moved to New Jersey in 2017, following Mars’ $23 billion acquisition of Chicago-based Wrigley in 2008. The Mars Wrigley global headquarters are located on Goose Island in Chicago. Workers at the closing Chicago plant will be “encouraged to explore the opportunities to apply for open roles across our network, specifically in the Chicago area,” the Mars Wrigley spokesperson said. Mars Wrigley has an ice cream factory in Burr Ridge, a candy factory in Yorkville and a pet nutrition manufacturing site in downstate Mattoon, among other Illinois locations, the company said. The plant at 2019 N. Oak Park Ave. produces a variety of “filled bar chocolate” such as 3 Musketeers and Milky Way, the company said. The success of the Milky Way, a malted milk candy bar introduced in 1923, helped build the company and the Chicago factory, with founder Frank Mars moving the company from Minneapolis to Chicago when it opened in 1929. Built on 16 acres in a residential area, the plant was named the “factory of the month” in a 1953 Chicago Tribune series, which called it “an outstanding bit of architecture ... in a beautiful setting of brilliant green bent grass, beds of flowers, shrubs and towering trees.” The factory included tinted walls, red tile roofs and two-story-high curved-top windows. Inside, fine art adorned the walls and Oriental rugs were “scattered about,” reflecting the company’s mission to create a better workplace and beautify the neighborhood, according to the Tribune article. The Tribune reported that the candy bar plant was the “largest of its kind in the world,” at least as of 1953. The property was formerly part of the Westward Ho Golf Club. Mars Wrigley plans to donate the factory site “for the use of the community,” the company said. Mars moved its corporate headquarters to New Jersey in 1940 and relocated to Virginia in 1984, where the parent company remains. rchannick@chicagotribune.com",Business/Chicago Tribune,Mars Wrigley closing nearly century-old chocolate plant on Chicago’s West Side,https://news.yahoo.com/mars-wrigley-closing-nearly-century-013800125.html
1/27/2022,"COMACHUEN, Mexico (AP) — In Comachuen, a Purepecha Indigenous community of about 10,000 inhabitants nestled high in the pine-clad mountains of the western state of Michoacan, the whole town survives because of the money sent home by migrants working in the United States. That money, known as remittances, kept families fed after local woodworking sales dropped off a decade ago when pine lumber started to become scarce. The money has allowed their families to remain in Comachuen rather than moving to other parts of Mexico for work. That — and the fact kids spend much of the year with their mothers and grandparents — has helped preserve the Purepecha language among almost everyone in town. The traditional textiles, woodworking and construction live on, largely because such enterprises are funded by migrants who send money home to build houses here. Many things here — the church, the bull ring, the charity donations — are paid for by migrants. The Mexican government believes remittances last year will surpass $50 billion for the first time. But whether the remittances allow families to just survive or progress enough so their kids won’t have to emigrate varies, reflecting a person’s plans and outlook. The cold winter mornings in Comachuen are a throwback to another era. The men are back in town because of the seasonal lull in agricultural work in the United States. Many workers from Comachuen get H2A temporary U.S. work visas, while others go without documents. Hundreds of men here work at the same vegetable farm in upstate New York every year, planting onions, harvesting squash, cabbage and beans. Porfirio Gabriel, an organizer who recruits workers to go north, estimates that one farm alone has brought $5 million into the town over three years, by far its largest single source of income. Inhabitants exchange greetings in Purepecha as they pass each other in the narrow streets. At one end of town, three drovers head their teams of oxen through the streets and into the surrounding hills to haul down freshly cut pine trunks on narrow carts. The tree trunks are laid in the street in front of the homes of those who purchase them, to be sawn down in backyard workshops. The whir of wood lathes mixes with the shouts of men hauling bricks and wheelbarrows of sand and gravel into half-built houses. Comachuen comes alive in winter. Tranquilino Gabriel — it is a common last name here — is turning out decorative wood spindles on a primitive lathe. The 59-year-old does this only on his downtime from working in the U.S., to keep his decades-old family business alive. The 5 pesos (25 cents) he gets for each is just supplementary income. He says wood is getting scarce and it’s unclear how much longer they will be able to do it. “More people are clearing land and planting avocado trees,” Gabriel says. Gabriel is resigned to working in the United States as long as he can. He sends home about $7,500 each year from what he earns working the fields. That money is largely used to fund his children’s education, paying private college fees so his eldest son can be a registered nurse. His hope is that his children will get university degrees and not have to emigrate. “I am paying for their studies, so that they don’t have to do what we had to do,” Gabriel says. Apart from spindles, which are shipped to a nearby town to be assembled into bookcases and shelves, the economy here largely involves migrants selling to other migrants. José González, 55, works at the corner shop that he remodeled, stocked and extended with money he has earned over a decade working in the United States. González, who has the stern, thoughtful face of an Indigenous drill sergeant, says he used to do woodworking, “but it wasn’t enough to meet our basic needs.” After working the fields in Mexico for a while, he had to emigrate. Now his well-stocked store sells canned goods and food to the families of migrants. Omar Gabriel, 28, sells sand, gravel, cement and rebar to migrants who are building or expanding their homes in Comachuen with money they earn in the U.S. Gabriel, one of the younger and better educated of the migrant workers, studied accounting at a university nearby. He has plans that don’t include forever going north to plant onions each spring. His money from U.S. farm work goes to expand the family firm, Don Beto Materials, and pay for his younger brother’s university education as an architect. The family just bought a used bulldozer with money he earned in the north. Previously they bought a dump truck. “My goal is to work for five more years (in the United States) to get together enough capital to get the company going right” as a full-services construction firm, from blueprints to excavation to building, he says. But even if Gabriel will no longer have to migrate some day, it appears his business will probably always be dependent on a steady stream of migrant customers with dollars in their pockets. The next generation is the key: Will the influx of remittances allow Comachuen’s young adults to build a life in Mexico, instead of doing stoop labor in U.S. fields? Andrés Reyes Baltazar, 20, is studying business administration at a public university in the state capital, Morelia. On winter break, he was helping his father, Asención Reyes Julian, 41, in the family’s furniture workshop, where they’re building a huge wooden cupboard about six feet wide and eight feet tall. (Many Mexican homes don’t have closets.) The father has been going north to work since 2011 because, he says, in the furniture trade “sometimes there are customers, and sometimes there aren’t.” Reyes Julian spends much of the money he earns in New York to pay for his son’s education. Andrés has dreams of using his education to build the business, perhaps buying a truck to reach broader markets and get better prices for their furniture. Making finished pieces brings better profit margins than turning out furniture parts, and the Reyes family is one of the few here that still do it. But when asked whether he too will someday go north to work in the United States, Andrés is evasive. “I might, perhaps. But first I’m going to finish my education.” Andrea Sánchez, 21, speaks perfect English. She migrated without documents to California with her family as a young child in 2002 and studied at U.S. schools through the sixth grade. When her family returned to Comachuen, she said, “it was a big shock ... it was really different.” In the decade since, she has learned to love her hometown, even if it doesn’t have the large homes and well-kept yards she saw in her childhood. “This is home. This culture calls to me.” Even though she is studying here to be a teacher, and helping her mother with the family’s traditional embroidered textile business, she still holds dreams of returning to the United States someday. ""If there is that possibility, I would,” she said, adding: “I would rather do things legally. That would be the goal.”",U.S./Associated Press,Indigenous town in Mexico survives on remittances from US,https://news.yahoo.com/indigenous-town-mexico-survives-remittances-050507207.html
1/27/2022,"PEORIA — Local health and public-development officials ordered an East Bluff fast-food restaurant to close temporarily. Inappropriate disposal and storage of used cooking grease resulted in problems at Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, 1800 N. Knoxville Ave., according to Joe Dulin, the city's community development director. The restaurant closed Monday afternoon. Grease leaked on the restaurant's drive-thru lanes and sidewalks, Dulin said Tuesday. The grease also was on the verge of leaking into a nearby stormwater-retention pond and into the city sewer system. Peoria restaurant news: Here are 10 food-related businesses set to open in 2022 in the Peoria area The situation violated local plumbing and health codes, according to Dulin. ""It would continue to create a mess outside and create grease everywhere as well,"" he said. ""I think the scope of this is ultimately why we had to shut it down.""

She said she wasn't sure when the restaurant would reopen. The Peoria City/County Health Department is working with Popeyes management regarding next steps, according to Diana Scott, the department's spokeswoman. She did not provide additional details. Last September, a Popeyes at 103 N. Main St. in East Peoria was ordered closed for a week because of an illegal discharge of grease into a storm sewer.

1/27/2022,"MADRID (Reuters) - Russia would face massive economic consequences if it launched any kind of military intervention in Ukraine, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Wednesday. Russia has massed tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine but denies planning to attack its neighbour. It is seeking sweeping security guarantees from NATO including a pledge that Ukraine will never be allowed to join the alliance. The European Union and the United States have threatened further crippling economic sanctions against Russia if it invades Ukraine. ""It's important to convey the message to Russia that any case of military intervention would have massive and serious consequences for its economy from EU sanctions,"" Sanchez told a joint news conference with his Finnish counterpart. He did not specify what form the sanctions would take. Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin reiterated that her country had no immediate plans to join NATO but said that Russia had no veto over any such decision. ""We have the possibility of applying (to join NATO) in the future and it's very important that we keep this possibility open to ourselves. Nobody can say to us what to do. It's our own decision,"" she said. Finland shares a 1,340 (830 mile) border with Russia and a difficult history that included clashes during World War Two. Though not a NATO member, Finland cooperates with the alliance and it has enhanced its military readiness as Moscow has built up its forces along the border with Ukraine. Earlier this month, Marin told Reuters Finland would stand with its European Union partners and the United States by imposing tough new sanctions on Russia if it attacks Ukraine.

In video shot by Jaco De Swardt and posted recently by the wildlife site Latest Sightings, the leopard casually grooms itself as the porcupine watches nearby on the road in Kruger National Park. The tension escalates and the leopard eventually abandons nonchalance and aggressively paws at the critter. The porcupine hisses and jabs a needle right through the leopard’s paw, leaving the cat licking its wound while the prickly critter saunters off. Porcupines can be covered by more than 30,000 quills, according to National Geographic. Just one taught this leopard a painful lesson.

1/27/2022,"By Will Dunham WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government scientists said on Wednesday they have taken an important step in the long trek toward making nuclear fusion - the very process that powers stars - a viable energy source for humankind. Using the world's largest laser, the researchers coaxed fusion fuel for the first time to heat itself beyond the heat they zapped into it, achieving a phenomenon called a burning plasma that marked a stride toward self-sustaining fusion energy. The energy produced was modest - about the equivalent of nine nine-volt batteries of the kind that power smoke detectors and other small devices. But the experiments at a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory facility in California represented a milestone in the decades-long quest to harness fusion energy, even as the researchers cautioned that years of more work are needed. The experiments produced the self-heating of matter in a plasma state through nuclear fusion, which is the combining of atomic nuclei to release energy. Plasma is one of the various states of matter, alongside solid, liquid and gas. ""If you want to make a camp fire, you want to get the fire to hot enough that the wood can keep itself burning,"" said Alex Zylstra, an experimental physicist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory - part of the U.S. Energy Department - and lead author of the research published in the journal Nature. ""This is a good analogy for a burning plasma, where the fusion is now starting to become self-sustaining,"" Zylstra said. The scientists directed 192 laser beams toward a small target containing a capsule less than a tenth of an inch (about 2 mm) in diameter filled with fusion fuel consisting of a plasma of deuterium and tritium - two isotopes, or forms, of hydrogen. At very high temperatures, the nucleus of the deuterium and the nucleus of the tritium fuse, a neutron and a positively charged particle called an ""alpha particle"" - consisting of two protons and two neutrons - emerge, and energy is released. ""Fusion requires that we get the fuel incredibly hot in order for it to burn - like a regular fire, but for fusion we need about a hundred million degrees (Fahrenheit). For decades we've been able to cause fusion reactions to occur in experiments by putting a lot of heating into the fuel, but this isn't good enough to produce net energy from fusion,"" Zylstra said. ""Now, for the first time, fusion reactions occurring in the fuel provided most of the heating - so fusion is starting to dominate over the heating we did. This is a new regime called a burning plasma,"" Zylstra said. Unlike burning fossil fuels or the fission process of existing nuclear power plants, fusion offers the prospect of abundant energy without pollution, radioactive waste or greenhouse gases. Nuclear fission energy comes from splitting atoms. Fusion energy comes from fusing atoms together, just like inside stars, including our sun. Private-sector ventures - dozens of companies and institutions- also are pursuing a fusion energy future, with some oil companies even investing. ""Fusion energy is the holy grail of clean limitless energy,"" said Annie Kritcher of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, lead designer for the experiments conducted in 2020 and 2021 at the National Ignition Facility and first author of a companion paper published in the journal Nature Physics. In these experiments, fusion produced about 10 times as much energy as went into heating the fuel, but less than 10% of the total amount of laser energy because the process remains inefficient, Zylstra said. The laser was used for only about 10 billionths of a second in each experiment, with fusion production lasting 100 trillionths of a second, Kritcher added. Zylstra said he is encouraged by the progress. ""Making fusion a reality is an enormously complex technological challenge, and it will require serious investment and innovation to make it practical and economical,"" Zylstra said. ""I view fusion as a decadal-scale challenge for it to be a viable source of energy.""
