12/17/2021,"The tornadoes that devastated the Midwest and parts of the South this weekend were some of the deadliest on record in the US. When one hit 2 miles from her house, Amazon worker Leslie Campbell missed her warehouse shift. Amazon's HR team said at first it had no record of tornadoes in Kentucky and couldn't excuse her shift. Leslie Campbell said she used to chase tornadoes as a teenager — but the storm last Friday was different. ""It became pitch white from the rain,"" she told Insider. ""It had a weird feeling to it."" The tornadoes that ripped through the Midwest and parts of the South on Friday night were some of the deadliest on record, killing more than 70 people in Kentucky alone. One tornado landed just two miles away from Campbell's home in Taylor County, about 90 miles south of Louisville, she said. After sheltering with her mother through the night, 33-year-old Campbell left at 4:45 a.m. for her Saturday shift at the Amazon warehouse in Campbellsville, Kentucky. She took the job as a picker in September because the early hours gave her flexibility to help her sister, a single mother. En route, Campbell was turned back by police searching for survivors near a sheep farm destroyed by the storm, she told Insider. She stopped in a church — the only place where she could find cell service — and called Amazon's HR team known as the Employee Resource Center (ERC). Campbell said she explained she was physically unable to make it to her shift due to tornado damage. On the other end of the line, an ERC representative told her it had no record of the twisters, she said. For Campbell, missing work put her attendance record in ""negative UPT,"" according to screenshots viewed by Insider, a status that she said could threaten her job. Amazon gives workers a certain amount of paid time off and unpaid time off, or UPT. Dipping into negative UPT, or taking more than the allotted UPT, can be grounds for dismissal, Campbell said. This is consistent with what Amazon employees have previously told Insider about negative UPT. After attempting to drive to work two more times with no luck, Campbell tried reaching a company executive on Twitter. —ʟᴇꜱʟɪᴇ ᴄᴀᴍᴘʙᴇʟʟ (@LCampbell_35) December 11, 2021 That afternoon, Amazon retail chief Dave Clark had posted a tweet acknowledging the Amazon workers killed by a tornado after their warehouse collapsed in Illinois. Six people have now been confirmed dead at that facility. Campbell tweeted in response: ""I'm an Amazon worker in Kentucky, tornado hit 2 miles from my house and I physically couldn't get to work for my shift. The ERC team told me that they had no record of tornadoes in Kentucky and couldn't help me with not getting attendance time reduced for today."" Campbell's tweet generated hundreds of responses, and among the wave of replies was one from Clark. ""Sorry Leslie I shared with the team we will get it fixed for you all,"" he wrote. ""I didn't really expect it to take off like it did,"" Campbell told Insider. ""I honestly never expected him to see it."" After Clark replied, Campbell said she received a call back from the ERC, which once again told her there was no record of tornadoes in the area and advised her to bring the matter up at her next shift. Then, she got another call. ""The person seemed very, very excited,"" Campbell said. An HR rep told her Amazon would excuse her Saturday shift and pay her for the 11 hours she missed. Insider reached out to Amazon several times about Campbell's experience. A spokesperson did not respond. The company has previously said staff members are told to stay at home if they feel it's not safe to travel and can do so without fear of retribution. Campbell said she was shocked that Amazon would give her back the time and pay her, and even repeated it back on the phone to make sure it wasn't a mistake. She ""100%"" believes she would have been fired if Clark didn't see her tweet, Campbell told Insider. Despite the experience, Campbell told Insider she still wants to work at Amazon — but hopes the ERC partnership will be improved. ""It's kind of like 'Oh, we're gonna put you in a system and what the system says, you do,'"" Campbell said. ""The human element of it is missing, and it's sad.""

12/17/2021,"By Tim Cocks JOHANNESBURG, Dec 16 (Reuters) - A small study of seven COVID-19 cases in South Africa shows the Omicron variant can break through booster vaccine shots, one of the scientists involved said on Thursday. A group of seven German visitors to Cape Town, aged between 25 and 39, were infected at some point in late November or early December with confirmed cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant. A copy of the study seen by Reuters said they all suffered only mild to moderate symptoms and none required hospitalisation. Of the group, six were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, of whom five had also had a booster Pfizer shot while the sixth had received a booster dose of the Moderna vaccine. A seventh had received an initial dose of AstraZeneca's vaccine, followed by a second and then third booster dose of Pfizer. None had reported past infection with COVID-19. The infections occurred between one and two months after receipt of the booster shot. Wolfgang Preiser, a virologist at Stellenbosch University and one of the study's co-authors, told Reuters the study was currently under peer review. He said the study showed infection was possible and caused symptomatic disease even after boosted immunisation. A much bigger real world study of 581 people in Britain showed booster vaccines significantly restore protection against mild disease caused by the Omicron variant, in part reversing an otherwise steep drop in vaccine effectiveness, the UK Health Security Agency said last week. Scientists suspect that Omicron is more transmissible, given its rapid spread, but say it is too early for definitive conclusions on the severity of the disease it causes. Medical professionals say vaccination is still an essential tool in the fight against the pandemic. ""It still protects against severe disease and death: we are quite sure about that,"" Preiser said. However, he added, ""the picture emerging is that this virus is very capable of undermining the immune response ... (so) it's clear that we will need an updated vaccine.""

12/17/2021,"A 42-year-old Hollywood wannabe has reportedly been arrested on the set of NCIS: Los Angeles in connection with the mysterious deaths of a 24-year-old Instagram model and her friend. Brandt Osborn, who originally hails from Staten Island, was one of three men arrested Wednesday over the November deaths of Christy Giles and Hilda Marcela Cabrales-Arzola, the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed Thursday. David Pearce, 37, and Michael Ansbach, 47, were identified as the other two men taken into custody Wednesday. Pearce faces a manslaughter charge, while Ansbach and Osborn are charged with accessory to manslaughter, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. “It is believed that both women were given drugs and overdosed,” the police department said in a press release that warned “there could be other victims.” Insta Model Found Dead After L.A. Warehouse Party Had Told Pal ‘Let’s Get Out of Here’ Giles’ lifeless body was found dumped on the sidewalk of a Los Angeles area hospital after she had attended a warehouse party with friends in mid-November. Cabrales-Arzola, a 26-year-old interior designer, was also dropped off at another L.A.-area hospital, and she initially survived, but was taken off life support weeks later when it was determined she was brain dead. The arrests were first reported by the New York Post. Inmate records for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department show Osborn was booked on Wednesday for a felony charge and is being held on $100,000 bail. Pearce and Ansbach were also listed with the same booking date and felony charge. No further details were immediately available on the allegations against the men. Osborn is said to have openly spoken to fellow actors about Giles’ death last month, boasting about “the craziest weekend of my life” at a shoot, actor David Murrietta Jr. told the Post. “He told me how they’d partied, two girls came back to their place, and the girls had a bunch of drugs,” Murrietta was quoted as saying. He recalled Osborn saying he’d left the residence and returned to have his roommate tell him Giles had died. “He checked her pulse, freaked out, decided not to call 911, and they decided what to do with the body,” he said, per the Post. Osborn’s IMDB profile lists credits for Nurse Jackie, in which he apparently appeared in an episode as the best man of the main character’s husband, and the 2012 film Ruse, for which he worked in the sound department. Investigators have been looking into the circumstances surrounding the women’s deaths since the two were first found dumped outside hospitals after a fun night out with friends. Both their families have publicly made clear they suspected foul play. In the wake of Giles’ death, her now-widowed husband, Jan Cilliers, told local news outlet KABC he had been text messaging with her in the hours before her death, and it was apparently her decision to leave the warehouse party that night that proved fatal. “I’ve got all the messages that she exchanged with anybody else that night and she was texting Marcela, the girl that she was with, at 5:30 saying let’s get out of here with the wide eye emoji,” he said.
