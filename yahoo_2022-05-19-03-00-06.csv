5/19/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - One military analyst had a brutally frank message for viewers of Russian state television: The war in Ukraine will get much worse for Russia, which is facing a mass mobilisation supported by the United States while Russia is almost totally isolated. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Russia state media - and especially state television - have supported the Kremlin's position. Few dissenting voices have been given air time. That appeared to have changed on Monday night when one well-known military analyst gave a blunt assessment to Russia's main state television channel of what Putin casts as the ""special military operation"". ""You should not swallow informational tranquilizers,"" Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired colonel, told the ""60 Minutes"" talk show on Rossiya-1 hosted by Olga Skabeyeva, one of the most pro-Kremlin journalists on television. ""The situation, frankly speaking, will get worse for us,"" said Khodaryonok, a regular guest on state TV who gives often candid assessments of the situation. He said that Ukraine could mobilise 1 armed million men. Khodaryonok, a military columnist for the gazeta.ru newspaper and a graduate of one of Russia's elite military academies, cautioned before the invasion that such a step would not be in Russia's national interests. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of the most serious confrontation between Russia and the United States since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Khodaryonok and Skabeyeva could not be reached for comment. SENSE OF REALISM The war has also shown the post-Soviet limits of Russia's military, intelligence and economic power: despite Putin's attempts to bolster his armed forces, the Russian military has fared badly in many battles in Ukraine. An encirclement of Kyiv was abandoned and Russia has turned its focus instead towards trying to establish control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The West has supplied billions of dollars of arms to Ukrainian forces. Losses are not publicly reported but Ukraine says Russian losses are worse than the 15,000 Soviets killed in the Soviet-Afghan war of 1979-1989. ""The desire to defend one's motherland in the sense that it exists in Ukraine - it really does exist there and they intend to fight to the last,"" Khodaryonok said before he was interrupted by Skabeyeva. The biggest strategic consequences of Russia's invasion to date have been the unusual unity of the United States' European allies and bids by Sweden and Finland to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. Khodaryonok said Russia needed to see the reality. ""The main thing in our business is have a sense of military-political realism: if you go beyond that then the reality of history will hit you so hard that you will not know what hit you,"" he said. ""Don't wave rockets in the direction of Finland for goodness sake - it just looks rather funny,"" he said. Russia, he said, was isolated. ""The main deficiency of our military-political position is that we are in full geopolitical solitude and - however we don't want to admit it - practically the whole world is against us - and we need to get out of this situation.""

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. Lupus is a serious and debilitating disease that's not only hard to diagnose and difficult to live with, but a challenge to treat. Many of the debilitating and troublesome symptoms can't be seen — such as fatigue and joint pain — leaving those living with lupus feeling isolated and misunderstood. The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that at least five million people worldwide are living with a form of lupus. Many celebrities, such as Paula Abdul, Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez, have been diagnosed with the condition and use their platform to educate fans about the disease. ""As many of you know, around a year ago I revealed that I have lupus, an illness that can affect people in different ways,"" Gomez told People in 2019. ""I’ve discovered that anxiety, panic attacks and depression can be side effects of lupus, which can present their own challenges. It's an everyday struggle."" May is Lupus Awareness Month, which aims to generate awareness of the chronic disease amongst the general public and medical community. Like many other life-threatening conditions, it's important to know the early warning signs so that patients may begin battling it early on. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. ""Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems, including your joints, blood cells, lungs, heart, skin and kidneys,"" Sandra Evans, a retired rheumatologist specializing in lupus, tells Yahoo Canada. ""It can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms often mimic other conditions."" Although the cause of lupus remains unknown, Evans explains that genetics, epigenetics, infections, viruses, certain medications and environmental factors play a role. ""Further study will strengthen our understanding of the causes of lupus, which should lead to improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention,"" says Evans. While anyone can get lupus, the condition mostly affects women between the ages of 15 and 44. ""Approximately nine out of 10 adults with the disease are women,"" Evans explains. ""It’s also more common in women of Hispanic, Native American, Asian and African American descent than in Caucasian women."" Recent research suggests that people who have a family member with lupus or another autoimmune disease may be more at risk, but it's likely that a combination of factors trigger the condition. No two cases of lupus are exactly alike, which makes the disease difficult to diagnose. Symptoms may develop slowly or come on suddenly, and may be or mild or severe. ""Most people living with lupus also have 'flares,' where symptoms get worse for a period of time, then improve or even disappear entirely,"" says Evans. The most distinctive sign of lupus — a facial rash that resembles butterfly wings across both cheeks — occurs in many but not all cases. Other symptoms include join pain and stiffness, fever, fatigue, anxiety, shortness of breath, dry eyes, headaches, chest pain and skin lesions. ""No single test can diagnose lupus, and it could take months or even years to really be sure. But usually, blood and urine tests, a physical exam and skin biopsies are used to make a diagnosis,"" adds Evans. If you or a loved one has symptoms of lupus, it's important to make an appointment to see a doctor. Treatment can depend on the severity of your symptoms. Once you're diagnosed, your physician will refer you to a rheumatologist who treats symptoms like joint pain and fatigue. ""Your rheumatologist will develop a personalized treatment plan that will help you prevent or treat flares, balance hormones, strengthen the immune system and reduce pain,"" says Evans. ""You may also get referred to a dermatologist to treat skin issues or a nephrologist if your kidneys are affected."" If you have lupus, you'll likely have a range of feelings about your condition, from worry and fear to extreme frustration. The challenges of living with the disease can increase your risk of mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and low self-esteem. To help cope, Evans suggests to connect with others who have lupus, gather support among friends and family, and make time for self-care. There is no single way to prevent lupus, but knowing what causes the disease can help you prevent certain symptoms. ""I would recommend limiting your time in direct sunlight, avoid overusing medications if possible, get enough sleep and develop stress management techniques,"" suggests Evans. ""As with everyone, it's important to exercise regularly, drink lots of water, and eat a healthy diet to prevent viruses or infections that can lead to the development of lupus.""

Carrie Ann Inaba is a regular on-screen personality known best for her role as a judge on Dancing With The Stars and her stint as a co-host on The Talk. But while she's a pro when it comes to putting a big smile on for the camera, she's opening up about the pain that she's suffered behind the cameras.
The 54-year-old host and dancer tells Yahoo Life that she's long ""defined myself through physical wellness,"" as a result of her lifelong dance practice. ""I was an athlete, I could move, I was fit. I was all of these things."" When she began to feel physical and chronic pain while judging her fourth season of DWTS, however, she felt in conflict with her identity.
Today, Inaba is outspoken about living with numerous autoimmune diseases including lupus, fibromyalgia and Sjogren's syndrome — the source of her painful symptoms — and accepts them as a part of her wellness journey. Just years ago, she was suffering in silence.
""I started experiencing all these symptoms. Symptoms that people couldn't see and wouldn't believe because I would show up on camera with full hair and makeup and look presentable. And that became very, very difficult to live that way,"" she says. ""I felt a lot of shame, you know, when you're presenting one thing but there's another reality. And I had to surrender up the idea that I was a fit dancer, and that was my identity.""",Health/Yahoo Canada Style,Selena Gomez calls lupus an 'everyday struggle': What are the signs and symptoms?,https://news.yahoo.com/selena-gomez-lupus-awareness-month-125648535.html
5/19/2022,"A rattlesnake woke up an Arizona woman up in the middle of the night, and the predicament actually got worse in the minutes that followed. The venomous snake vanished from sight, which meant it was still there but hiding. It happened recently at a home in Marana, about 20 miles northwest of Tucson, and the homeowner ultimately took refuge in another part of the house, according to Derek Carlson, a rattlesnake prevention specialist with Rattlesnake Solutions. “The western diamondback rattlesnake was initially found early in the morning by the homeowner on the side of her bed,” Carlson told McClatchy News. “For obvious reasons, she left the room quickly. She called a neighbor who helped look for the snake. He searched for a good period with no luck. She then decided to call me to inspect the entire house for the snake.” Carlson had been to the same home a day earlier, removing an even larger rattlesnake from the yard. He came back for round two and faced an ominous bedroom door with towels stuffed in all the cracks. “As soon as I opened the door to the master bedroom, I heard a slight buzzing sound,” Carlson said, noting the snake was not immediately visible. “I opened the master bathroom door and found a juvenile western diamondback rattlesnake in a defensive posture on a bathroom mat below her vanity.” The venomous snake was about a foot and a half long and Carlson managed to capture it quickly and place it in a bucket. Adult western diamondbacks average 3 to 5 feet in Arizona, according to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum. The terrified homeowner then asked him to search the rest of the house. No other snakes were found, he said. “It was determined that the snake came in through the back patio door that was left open. She had her security door closed, but the gap underneath was quite a large one,” Carlson said. Rattlesnake Solutions posted a photo of the rattlesnake May 16 on Facebook, where it has gotten hundreds of reactions. (The snake was later released alive in the desert, according to Carlson.) “That’s called a Monday morning heart attack!” Tracey Murray Templeton wrote on Facebook. “No way that I would ever spend the night in that house again,” Debbe Taylor said. “See that is the reason private citizens should be allowed to have hand grenades,” Mike Jennings posted.
