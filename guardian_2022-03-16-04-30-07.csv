3/16/2022,"Ed Sheeran was targeted with a “concerted plan” to secure his interest in a songwriter who later accused him of copying one of his songs, the high court has been told. The former management company for Sami Chokri, a grime artist who performs under the name Sami Switch, allegedly made a “huge effort” to bring the 2015 song Oh Why to Sheeran’s notice, the copyright trial heard on Tuesday. One company director claimed that they felt cheated and upset by Sheeran’s alleged “blatant copying” of the song in his 2017 hit Shape Of You. Chokri and his co-writer, Ross O’Donoghue, claimed that a central “Oh I” hook in Sheeran’s song was “strikingly similar” to an “Oh why” in their own composition. Sheeran and his co-authors, producer Steven McCutcheon and Snow Patrol’s John McDaid, deny copying and say they do not remember hearing Oh Why before the legal fight. Lawyers for Chokri and O’Donoghue have alleged there is “clear, cogent and compelling” evidence that Oh Why was widely available and sent to a number of Sheeran’s close friends and colleagues. In written evidence, David May, managing director of Artists and Company (A&C), a firm that used to manage Chokri, said that when Oh Why was being promoted the outfit had “a concerted plan to target Ed Sheeran in the hope of engaging his interest in Sami’s work … We did not target any other artist in the same way.” He added: “We felt that, if Ed Sheeran could see Sami’s work, he would recognise his talent. We saw this as a real possibility because of the connections that we had, and Sami had, to his circle.” May said people targeted in 2015 included late SBTV founder Jamal Edwards, Jake Roche of the band Rixton and senior people at Sheeran’s publisher. In written evidence, Roche said he never listened to Oh Why, while Edwards had said he did not remember listening to the track. Timothy Bowen, an A&C director, said that after hearing Shape Of You in 2017 “we were surprised by what we thought was a blatant copying”. He said: “We were upset that Ed Sheeran had not asked for clearance to include the relevant part of Oh Why into Shape Of You. Having made a huge effort to bring Oh Why to Ed’s notice, the next thing we heard was a part of Oh Why appearing on Ed’s song, Shape Of You, without any acknowledgment or request for permission.” He also claimed Sheeran’s publishing representatives gave “short shrift and refused to engage with us at all”. Earlier in the trial, Chokri disagreed with a suggestion by Ian Mill QC, representing the Shape Of You co-writers, that his management firm had “singularly failed“ to develop his career after the release of his EP, Solace, in June 2015. Sheeran has said he does not recall anyone sending Oh Why to him “in any way” before he wrote Shape Of You. Mill previously said that Chokri and O’Donoghue’s claim that Sheeran had “access” to their work was “at best, paper thin” and there was “clear evidence” that at the time Shape Of You was written its creators had not heard Oh Why. The court has previously heard that PRS for Music has suspended certain payments to Sheeran and his co-writers for the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. The three co-authors launched legal proceedings in May 2018, asking the High Court to declare they had not infringed Chokri and O’Donoghue’s copyright. Chokri and O’Donoghue then issued their own claim for “copyright infringement, damages and an account of profits in relation to the alleged infringement”.

3/16/2022,"There has been a crackle of excitement in Barbados this week, augmented by the news that Saqib Mahmood will make a highly anticipated debut for the visitors when the second Test against West Indies gets under way on Wednesday. England have travelled here more than anywhere else in the Caribbean over the past 20 years, enjoying its white-powdered beaches and easygoing vibe, and with 10,000 tourists on the island – plus the lifting of restrictions allowing a full house at Kensington Oval – Joe Root’s side should feel very lucky to be here. Not that all this helped three years ago when Jason Holder’s double century, a stirring display of fast bowling led by Kemar Roach and Roston Chase’s transmogrification into Lance Gibbs whipped the outnumbered locals in the Greenidge and Haynes Stand into a frenzy with a 381-run win from which a 2-1 series victory followed. Both sides were beaten by the pitch in Antigua last week and remain at 0-0. But here, having placed his hand on a bare surface in the search for clues, Root wondered whether more carry is likely and perhaps more deterioration. Jack Leach will note that this is where Jomel Warrican picks up wickets at 25 runs apiece for Barbados, even if his fellow left-armer, Veerasammy Permaul, is the incumbent West Indies spinner. West Indies (possible): Brathwaite (c), Campbell, Brooks, Bonner, Blackwood, Holder, Da Silva (wk), Joseph, Roach, Permaul, Permaul, Seales  England: Lees, Crawley, Root (c), Lawrence, Stokes, Bairstow, Foakes (wk), Woakes, Overton, Leach, Mahmood  England have espoused a new era dawning on tour but with one win in their last 15 Tests, a change in the narrative still hinges on positive results not just positive declarations. The path to 20 wickets is complicated by Mark Wood’s elbow injury, the knock-on being Mahmood’s elevation – cap number 702 for England – and no Ollie Robinson amid caution over the back spasms that ruled him out last week. The way Root spoke about Mahmood before naming the XI on Tuesday already hinted at Saqib getting a go. Lancashire’s 25-year-old right-armer has just one first-class five-wicket haul to date but, with this coming through a fine burst of reverse swing during last year’s Roses match at Old Trafford, before a starring role in last summer’s ODI series against Pakistan, the excitement here is understandable. “He’s very mature for a guy who hasn’t played a huge amount of international cricket,” said Root. “He’s been very impressive, he’s got a slightly different trajectory and will give us a point of difference. Clearly he has good control, especially if the ball moves with reverse swing. It’s a great option to have up our sleeve.” In some ways Mahmood had to play here if the benefits of leaving Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad at home are to be truly felt. Robinson’s absence will continue the question mark over his conditioning for the rigours of Test cricket, the issue first flaring up in Hobart in January and leaving England a bowler down. The resulting reticence now means another chance for Chris Woakes and Craig Overton. Woakes is the father of the house in this squad aged 33 and plenty has been asked of him by England this winter. There is an abundance of goodwill behind a hard-working and unpretentious cricketer who excels at home but struggles away; perhaps inspiration during this latest chance will come from the surroundings at the Kensington Oval. This can certainly be found at every turn when players gambol down the stairs of the beautiful art deco Garfield Sobers pavilion that sits in the corner of the ground and looks like the bridge of one of cruise ships in Bridgetown harbour. West Indies may well be unchanged and, if conditions allow, a fine spectacle is in the offing.",Sport/Sport,Saqib Mahmood gets Test chance as England look to attack West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/saqib-mahmood-gets-test-chance-as-england-look-to-attack-west-indies
3/16/2022,"Spain’s Nuclear Safety Council (CSN) has appealed for people to be on the lookout for a soil-testing kit containing radioactive material that was stolen from a van in the Madrid region. In a statement released on Tuesday, the CSN said it had been notified of the theft of the bright yellow Troxler density and moisture gauge, which was taken after the van’s rear door was forced open in the town of Humanes, 25km south of the capital. The council said the equipment contained Caesium-137 and Americium-241/Beryllium, adding the two radioactive sources are classified as category four on the one-to-five scale established by the International Atomic Energy Agency, on which five is the least dangerous category. “Category four is classed as ‘unlikely to be dangerous to people’ because, given its low radioactivity, it does not pose radiological risks as long as it is kept closed and intact,” the statement said. “The radioactive sources are located in the [kit’s] interior, where they are protected and encapsulated. They could, however, pose a risk if the kit is opened or damaged, resulting in the loss of the sources’ protection.” The CSN released pictures and a description of the Troxler gauge. The box-shaped yellow kit has a metal handle, a glass screen with a keyboard and a metallic tube where the radioactive materials are housed. The equipment is kept in a yellow transport case that carries a radiation symbol and warning. “Anyone who finds the equipment must avoid handling it and should immediately inform the authorities, the police, or the emergency services,” the statement said.",News/World news,Spain: call for return of stolen kit containing radioactive material,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/spain-call-for-return-of-stolen-kit-containing-radioactive-material
3/16/2022,"The first national project to record mass killings on the Australian frontier has found that around half of all massacres of Aboriginal people were carried out by police and other government forces. Many others were perpetrated by settlers acting with tacit approval of the state. The final findings of the eight-year long Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project show that conflict was widespread and most massacres were planned, in a deliberate attempt to eradicate Aboriginal people and Aboriginal resistance to the colonisation of the country. Researchers have added 113 sites, mostly from Western Australia and the Northern Territory, in the final stage of the project. There are now 415 sites on the map, each representing a place where six or more people were killed. The most common excuse for a massacre was as a reprisal for the killing a colonist, and the number of people killed was heavily disproportionate. The death of one colonist could result in police-led revenge expeditions that lasted weeks or months. Researchers found that attacks on settlers, while often referred to in historical documents as the reason for a killing, often took place after the alleged “killing of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people, abduction and sexual abuse of women, or livestock’s use of hunting grounds and water”. While numbers should be considered to be indicative rather than exact, the difference in casualties is stark. In an analysis by Guardian Australia based on the data, Aboriginal deaths were estimated to be 27 to 33 times higher than coloniser deaths. Between 11,000 and 14,000 Aboriginal people died, compared with only 399 to 440 colonisers. The tallies of the dead are not the only measure of what took place, according to Dr Bill Pascoe, a digital humanities specialist and key researcher on the project. “We are always using conservative estimates,” Pascoe said. “We want to make sure it can stand up to any kind of criticism that might be thrown at it. We don’t want to be accused of overinflating figures. “Another one of the challenges is objectification. White research objectifies Indigenous people, it’s a big problem, and numbers tend to objectify. So it’s easy just to say 11,000 people [were] killed, and carry on with the next news item … so, one of the main challenges [has been], how can I work against that?” Pascoe said narratives were “one of the most important” parts of the map because they gave a more personal account of events. “[It] helps you think about those people and what they were going through, and some of it is really horrific. Then you add that up, that scale of terror, and for the survivors living after it, and you multiply that by 11,000.” Massacres classified as “opportunity” were the second most common. Most of these attacks were planned, not random clashes, and many had government involvement or were carried out in the knowledge that there would be no formal repercussions. A significant number of massacres took place to “teach the natives a lesson” after the theft of livestock – evidence of the conflict over land, water and resources between settlers and the Aboriginal people they were systematically displacing. Most massacres perpetrated by stockmen and settlers were found in the Northern Territory. Emeritus professor Lyndall Ryan, who led the project, said that stockmen in the NT commonly operated under the orders of big pastoral companies. “Particularly after 1860, it is becoming clear that most of the massacres are being conducted by employees of major companies who are bankrolling these big pastoral leases, or mining leases,” Ryan said. “These companies have more money to arm their employees with good firearms to go out and do their work. It’s not the small selector who’s killing Aboriginal people, it’s these big companies who have experienced overseers, experienced stockmen, to patrol and contain the Aboriginal people.” Massacres after 1890 tended to be carried out over longer periods across broader areas, the researchers found. Ryan described these as “genocidal massacres”. “The code of silence really made it very hard for people to speak. [But] I think a lot of people knew what was going on,” Ryan said. “The newspapers have been an extraordinary source of evidence. What is most interesting about the newspapers is people from northern Australia … would write to the Argus or the Age or [other metropolitan papers] and tell them what was going on. So people in Melbourne knew what was going on. “And the reason why these people from north Queensland will write into the papers in Sydney and Melbourne and Adelaide, is because there were companies based in Melbourne that were bankrolling either mining companies, or pastoral companies in northern Australia. “And so these people who are writing are often employees of those companies. It’s as if they’re reporting to their superiors what is going on.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Researchers said although the project was complete, there was much more work to be done. Pascoe said he hoped the map would continue to be a reliable resource to “inform public debate”. “That’s an important role for academia, generally, to be a reliable source of information that’s been through some sort of rigorous methodology,” he said. “The intention [is] to present a clearer and an accurate picture of what we can be confident of.” The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

3/16/2022,"A black child was subjected by police to a strip search at her London school that involved exposure of intimate body parts, according to an official investigation which found racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the officers’ actions. No appropriate adult was present during the 15-year-old girl’s ordeal, described by a senior local authority figure as “humiliating, traumatising and utterly shocking” and which took place without parental consent and in the knowledge that she was menstruating. Details of her treatment in her secondary school’s medical room have emerged in a child safeguarding review initiated by Hackney council after the incident in December 2020. The child was made to bend over, spread her legs and use her hands to spread her buttocks while coughing, and she is now in therapy and self-harming, according to family members’ statements to the inquiry. The damning report said: “Having considered the context of the incident, the views of those engaged in the review and the impact felt by Child Q and her family, racism (whether deliberate or not) was likely to have been an influencing factor in the decision to undertake a strip search.” The report emphasised the importance of the question of whether the child was treated differently because she was black, adding this line of inquiry had been starkly reflected in several events that took place around the same time. “Significantly, some six months prior, George Floyd was tragically killed in the USA and there were repercussions around the globe, including in the UK,” it said. Police were called by teachers who told the review that they believed she was smelling strongly of cannabis and suspected she was carrying drugs, but none were found during the subsequent search. The school was visited by four officers including two women who carried out the search of the girl – referred to in the report as ‘Child Q’ – while teachers remained outside the room and her mother was not contacted. “Someone walked into the school, where I was supposed to feel safe, took me away from the people who were supposed to protect me and stripped me naked, while on my period,” the girl said in a statement, adding that she did not know if she would “ever feel normal again”. The Metropolitan police on Tuesday said they apologised for what a senior officer described as the child’s “truly regrettable” treatment, which has been the subject of a separate Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation, whose report is nearing completion. But senior members of the local council furiously criticised the force in the wake of the review, which concluded that Child Q should never have been strip searched, and found there was an absence of a “safeguarding-first” approach from many of the professionals involved. One of eight findings includes school staff deferring to the authority of the police on their arrival at school. It added: “They should have been more challenging to the police, seeking clarity about the actions they intended to take.” Anntoinette Bramble, Hackney’s deputy mayor and cabinet member for children’s services, and the mayor of Hackney, Philip Glanville, said: “All aspects of this review have appalled us: the decision by police officers to strip search a child in her school; the lack of challenge by the school toward police; the absence of requirements of police to seek parental consent in the strip search of a child. “But most stark: that racism is likely to have been an ‘influencing factor’ in the decision by police to undertake the strip search.” They added that the child’s ordeal had been exacerbated by the fact the strip search had been carried out at school “a place where the child had an expectation of safety, security and care. Instead, she was let down by those who were meant to protect her.” The child’s mother said in statements provided for the review that her daughter had been searched by the police and was asked to go back into an exam without any teacher asking her about how she felt, knowing what she had just gone through. “Their position in the school is being part of the safeguarding team, but they were not acting as if they were a part of that team. This makes me sick – the fact that my child had to take her sanitary towel off and put the same dirty towel back on because they would not allow her to use the restroom to clean herself.” The child’s maternal aunt said her niece had turned from a “a happy go lucky girl” to a “timid recluse” who hardly spoke to her. She was now so traumatised that she was self-harming and required therapy. In a letter, the aunt added: “The family do not believe that the officers would have treated a Caucasian girl child who was on her monthly periods in the same way.” Those who carried out the review were in agreement, concluding that racism was likely to have been an “influencing factor” in the strip search, and that the child had been subjected to “adultification” bias – where black and global majority children are held to adult standards, but their white peers are less likely to be. In a statement released by the Metropolitan police, the force identified the girl as a 15-year-old and said that the search had been conducted after her bag and outer clothing had already been searched by staff at the school prior to police arrival. The search took place in the same part of London where the Met apologised in January and paid compensation to an academic for “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” used by officers about her when she was strip searched.",News/UK news,"Racism cited as factor in police strip search of girl, 15, at London school",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/black-girl-racism-police-strip-search-london-school-hackney
3/16/2022,"Twenty years ago, in the wake of the September 11 terror attacks, the CIA established an international torture programme “rendering” people to secret detention facilities around the world. The full horror of what took place in these black sites is still emerging. We already know of mock executions and sexual violence; of a detainee waterboarded 83 times in a month; of a man dying during an interrogation and another of hypothermia after being left almost naked on a bare concrete floor – on top of the regular use of pain, humiliation and sleep deprivation. This week, we learned that Ammar al-Baluchi suffered brain damage when he was repeatedly slammed against a plywood wall by trainee interrogators using him as a teaching prop. They queued up to hit his head so that the instructor “could certify them on their ability to use the technique”. The details emerged in a damning report written by the CIA’s own inspector general in 2008, but only now released following a court filing. The “war on terror” became an end that was used to justify any means – but never openly. Torture was rebranded as “enhanced interrogation techniques”. Interrogators sought assurances that a detainee would “remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life” before they started work. The programme was pointless as well as brutal. The inspector general noted that the detainee lied to make the torture stop – in line with the 2014 Senate intelligence committee report that found that interrogations frequently produced false testimony (while non-coercive methods elicited useful information). At least 26 of 119 detainees were wrongly held in the first place. Mr Baluchi now faces the death penalty as one of five men at Guantanamo Bay charged with participation in the September 11 plot. The case has been in pre-trial hearings for 10 years, largely due to disputes over the admissibility of testimony obtained after torture. Last week, another Guantanamo detainee – Mohammad Ahmad al-Qahtani, who was suspected of planning to join the plot – was repatriated to Saudi Arabia for mental health treatment. The US dropped plans to try him after concluding he had been tortured at the facility. Despite our growing knowledge, we are still very far from a full acknowledgement of what took place – let alone accountability for it. The supreme court recently blocked two psychologists who designed the programme from being called in a case in Poland, where one of the black sites was located. The 2014 Senate report has never been released in full, though there are now renewed calls for its publication. In the UK, parliament’s intelligence and security committee produced damning reports on British involvement in kidnap and torture in 2018, but the government refused to launch a judge-led inquiry into UK complicity in the programme. On Tuesday, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism issued a scathing report on the failure to address the atrocities. “Not a single man who was rendered across borders, tortured, arbitrarily detained, separated from family has received an adequate remedy,” Fionnuala Ní Aoláin said. “Many who were returned home continue to live with long-term social and psychological trauma. No one was held accountable for systematic practices of torture and rendition.” This is not only about an injustice to individuals. The rapporteur suggests that the refusal to acknowledge what happened has helped create an environment in which there appears to be impunity for states conducting mass secret detention. An honest reckoning would help to debunk the dangerous myth that torture works and claims that national security requires unfettered powers used in secrecy. It is an essential part of ensuring such crimes are not committed again.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on CIA torture, two decades on: we need the truth | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-cia-torture-two-decades-on-we-need-the-truth
3/16/2022,"Justice delayed, they say, is justice denied. After a decade of underfunding and two years of the pandemic, courts in England and Wales are grinding to a halt. Dominic Raab, the lord chancellor, thinks there’s no quick fix for the criminal legal aid sector. Mr Raab claimed instead that he would take his time to get things right. The evidence suggests that he is getting things wrong. The backlog in crown courts, which hear the most serious cases, now stands at more than 59,000 cases, up on both before and since the onset of Covid-19. These include rape and sexual offence cases – in which the moving or rescheduling of trials at the last minute causes needless distress. Not only is the backlog lengthening, but the law is taking longer to run its course. As the average wait between crime and verdict in crown courts increases, so does the probability that a case collapses as victims drop out. Prior to the pandemic, defendants waiting to plead their innocence or victims desperate for their day in court could expect it to take a year and two months to see justice done. It’s now almost two years. Mr Raab says that he wants “swifter justice”. But his words are belied by his actions. He has managed to secure only enough Treasury cash to reduce the backlog to 53,000 cases by March 2025, a tally still higher than before the pandemic. Even this modest target looks unachievable thanks to a decade of running down the criminal courts system. About a quarter of junior barristers have left criminal practice in the past five years along with nearly half of all silks. The system is in such disarray that in almost 200 cases between July and September last year, a barrister could not be found for either prosecution or defence. Little surprise that during this period the number of trials postponed was 29% more than the number of trials completed. Matters came to a head this week when criminal barristers in England and Wales voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action. Mr Raab suddenly put out his response to last November’s independent review into criminal legal aid with a pay increase for barristers. While the extra cash is welcome, it’s too little, too late. The Criminal Bar Association thinks its members might get £100 a week extra, which might sway some barristers but probably not enough to stop the planned disruption. Mr Raab’s offer also contained a mechanism to undercut lawyers’ fees. Legal practitioners have waited nearly four years since an independent review into criminal legal aid was first committed to by ministers to get this deal. That the new funding won’t be implemented until the autumn only adds insult to injury. Last month, the lord chief justice – the most senior judge in England and Wales – made a rare public plea for Mr Raab to value the courts. “They must be properly funded in a way that leaves behind the notion that they are no more than an ordinary public service,” said Lord Burnett. Sadly, Mr Raab shows no sign of sharing this admirable sentiment.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Dominic Raab’s courts plan: making a bad situation worse | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/15/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-raabs-courts-plan-making-a-bad-situation-worse
3/16/2022,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of “going cap in hand from dictator to dictator,” as the prime minister prepares to fly to Saudi Arabia to seek alternatives to Russian oil supplies. Johnson has a personal relationship with the Saudi leader, Mohammed bin Salman, and government sources suggest he could help persuade the Saudis to increase oil production. The prime minister defended the trip on Tuesday, saying he had to build a coalition of countries to help the west reduce its dependence on Vladimir Putin, likening the Russian leader to a drug dealer who had got the west hooked on his hydrocarbons. Johnson said: “It’s vital, if we are going to stand up to Putin’s bullying, if we are going to avoid being blackmailed by Putin in the way that so many western countries sadly have been, we have got to get ourselves off Russian hydrocarbons.” The investment minister, Gerald Grimstone, will join the trip in an attempt to secure more investment in green technology in the UK. But concern in Britain and elsewhere about the Saudis’ record on human rights has intensified after Riyadh executed 81 men last weekend. Prince Mohammed is believed by US intelligence to have ordered the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. Starmer stopped short of calling for Johnson to cancel his trip, which will also take in the UAE, but warned against replacing a long-term dependence on Russian oil, with a reliance on the Saudis. “Obviously there’s a real energy crisis in terms of the cost at the moment, so anything that brings the cost down now is a step in the right direction, whatever it is,” the Labour leader said. “But going cap in hand from dictator to dictator is not an energy strategy”. He accused the government of a short term, “slapdash” approach to tackling the energy crisis. “There’s a pattern here which is short term, in the heat of the moment, slapdash. And that’s what happened in Afghanistan in August. The government was too slow to act; it was only in the heat of the moment it started acting, and then we all saw the consequences in August. “It’s the same with refugees here, in terms of slow, behind the curve, in the heat of the moment – and in terms of energy, which is a shot term, slapdash approach instead of a long-term strategy.” Starmer said instead of pursuing more supplies from Saudi Arabia, Johnson could bring down energy prices by implementing Labour’s plan to levy a windfall tax on oil producers. “Oil and gas companies in the North Sea have made more profit than they expected because of the global price. In their own words, they say we’ve got more money than we know what to do with: so tax that, use that to reduce your energy bills,” he said. Saudi Arabia is part of the Opec+ oil producers’ deal, of which Russia is also a member. It has so far been reluctant to increase production since the invasion of Ukraine led to rocketing prices. Johnson announced last week that the UK would end the import of Russian oil by the end of this year, and was examining the case for ending gas imports. The government is expected to publish a new energy independence plan later this month, including accelerated targets for boosting production of renewables, and a renewed focus on North Sea oil and gas. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, Johnson admitted western countries had made a “terrible mistake” by letting Putin “get away” with annexing Crimea in 2014 and allowing themselves to become more dependent on Russian energy. However, he told Britons that divesting from Russian power would be “painful” and that the financial help offered by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to help with rising bills this year could not be afforded for long. Sunak is expected to take limited measures to tackle the cost of living crisis in his spring statement next week, potentially including a cut to fuel duty. Last month the chancellor announced measures to limit the impact of energy price rises, including a £150 council tax rebate for properties in band A to D and a £200 reduction in household bills, to be clawed back over five years. But energy prices have surged higher since Russia invaded Ukraine, exacerbating the impact of price rises in other areas, and raising the spectre of inflation remaining high for much of the year.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson going ‘from dictator to dictator’ for oil, says Starmer",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/15/boris-johnson-going-from-dictator-to-dictator-for-oil-says-starmer
3/16/2022,"When the national lottery was launched in 1994, via a TV spectacular watched by more than a third of the population, the famous advertising slogan promised: “It could be you.” It won’t be Camelot though, at least not from 2024. During its tenure of nearly three decades as the lottery’s operator, Camelot outlasted five prime ministers, fought off challenges from the likes of Sir Richard Branson and navigated the rise of the internet and the smartphone. Now, barring a successful judicial review by Canadian-owned Camelot, which now has a 10-day “cooling-off” period to consider its next move, the torch will be passed on. The fourth ever battle for the lucrative licence ended in defeat to Czech-owned Allwyn, which also fended off competition from media tycoon Richard Desmond and Sisal, an Italian firm whose bid was complicated when it was bought for £1.6bn, midway through the competition, by Paddy Power owner Flutter. The big question is what Allwyn’s victory means for consumers, for the good causes that the lottery funds, for Camelot and its 1,000 staff in Watford, and for the new stewards of a game played by nearly 10 million people in the UK. Ultimately owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, Allwyn already runs lotteries in the Czech Republic, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, and Austria. To boost its efforts to add the UK to the stable, Allwyn hired an all-star cast of business luminaries. Leading the charge was Sir Keith Mills, whose Midas touch moments include inventing the Air Miles and Nectar Points loyalty schemes, as well as running London’s successful bid to host the 2012 Olympics. He was joined by former Sainsbury’s boss Justin King, who chairs Allwyn UK and worked with Mills on the delivery of the games. For the time being, the Gambling Commission won’t say what magic dust this duo were able to sprinkle to unseat Camelot. The competition process is shrouded in secrecy, so much so that a scorecard process during which the rivals were marked on categories such as technology and planned returns to good causes, used code names rather than the companies’ real ones. One well-placed source said that only two people knew which codenames applied to which bidder. While the regulator is remaining tight-lipped, the Guardian understands that Allwyn’s pitch outshone Camelot’s in two key areas: returns to good causes and efforts to curb gambling addiction. Camelot has come under pressure several times in recent years, after profits rose faster than returns to good causes, prompting a rebuke from the National Audit Office in 2017. The company stresses that its profits – about £95m in each of the past two years – amount to 1% of ticket sales. It also points to a recent uptick in good cause money, which fell below £1.5bn in the year of the NAO’s rebuke but has been above £1.7bn in each of the past two years, on the back of record ticket sales of £8bn. Its 28-year tenure, Camelot says, has led to the return of £45bn to 660,000 causes in the UK. But Allwyn is understood to have promised to do better than that, pledging money to good causes of more than £30bn over the course of its first 10-year licence. It aims to do this by recapturing the long lost glitz of the old weekly draw, offering more super-national lotteries, in the vein of EuroMillions, where larger jackpots pull in more players. On top of that, it promises a flood of new technology that it hopes can win a back younger audience which has drifted away from thelottery towards online betting and casino games, leading to a £9m decline in regular players since 1994. Its technology offering, via a partnership with Vodafone, will also work in shops, so that people can use their phone to access products such as scratchcards, allowing the high street to share the spoils rather than losing sales to the internet. The licence decision also comes with social responsibility high on the agenda, as the government, spurred by concern about gambling addiction finalises its white paper on regulation. Camelot has come under fire for seeking to ape the casinos rather than beat them, increasingly relying on more high-octane online Instant Win games. Allwyn is thought to have put responsible gambling at the forefront of its tech-heavy pitch, particularly a plan to impose strict controls preventing people from spending unaffordable sums, such as by playing repeatedly late at night. If the historic handover from Camelot does go ahead, it would likely be an existential matter for the incumbent. Its owner, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, is a vast investment fund with nearly £140bn of assets under management. Camelot has been a steady and lucrative investment but its sole raison d’être is to run the UK national lottery. Without that, it is unclear what Camelot is for. Its chair, Sir Nigel Railton, said on Tuesday that he was “incredibly disappointed” by the decision, while the company declared it was considering its options, potentially including a legal challenge. Labour said on Tuesday that the government must satisfy itself that Komarek did not have links to Russia. This seems unlikely to be a problem. Komarek has a gas storage venture with Gazprom in his native Czech Republic but has condemned Putin’s “barbarism” and is working with the Prague government on a plan that would see the asset nationalised. If Camelot can’t overturn the decision , there is at least hope for the 1,000 people who work for it, mostly in Watford. They, the Guardian understands, are likely to be transferred across to the new incumbent.",News/UK news,Why did Camelot lose the UK national lottery licence?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/why-did-camelot-lose-the-uk-national-lottery-licence
3/16/2022,"Attempts at the mass killing of Aboriginal people were still being made as recently as 1981, according to a historian who has spent the past four years researching colonial violence in the Northern Territory. Dr Robyn Smith, who has worked on the University of Newcastle’s colonial frontier massacres map project, says she has also found attempts at massacres in the 1930s and 40s. These horrors are not on the map because fewer than six people died – the research team’s strict criterion for inclusion. But Smith says it shows the violence of the frontier did not abate over time. “It says that the NT was still the frontier. Even though they might not have been successful, in a sense, the intention was to kill people,” Smith says. “I think people were under a bit more police scrutiny, so arbitrary shooting expeditions would have been easier to detect, whereas poisoning is far more underhanded.” The 1981 mass poisoning was reported at the time, but remains unsolved. An Aboriginal man and an Aboriginal woman died and 14 others were admitted to hospital, six of them seriously ill, after unwittingly sharing a poisoned bottle of sherry that had been deliberately left on the grounds of the John Flynn memorial church in Alice Springs. Nabbutta Abbott Nabarula, 50, and David Charlie Jagamara, 28, died on 29 March after drinking the wine, which had been poisoned with strychnine. A team of eight police detectives investigated the incident and offered a $20,000 reward, but no one was ever charged. The NT coroner, Denis Barritt, later found the two people had been “murdered by person or persons unknown”. The lack of detailed information about such recent crimes exemplifies the challenges of verifying frontier killings, Smith says. “It’s really, really difficult,” she says. “Unless, as often happens, someone writes about it 20, 30 or 40 years later, when either most of the perpetrators have died or moved away, or they think that the time for arrest and being held accountable has passed.” Smith says she has also identified massacre attempts in the 1930s and 40s. In 1940, Rembarrnga and Ngalkpon men, women and children were deliberately poisoned by a white overseer at Mainoru station, 250km north-east of Katherine, on the Roper River. It was “an act of spite” by the manager, Tom Boddington, for being sacked by his business partners, Smith says. “He poisoned rations and gave them to the Aboriginal stockman and their families. Essentially, he was trying to kill the workforce.” The story that appears in police records and oral histories is that Boddington took over after Mainoru’s manager, Billy Farrer, became ill. Boddington mismanaged the property, the partners fell into dispute and Boddington was sacked. The anthropologist Gillian Cowlishaw recorded an oral history with a Rembarrnga stockman, Bandicoot Robinson, in 1996. “Tom Boddington and I work, work, work there. He was a bad bloke too. He used to shoot, frighten the hell out of all those people,” Robinson told Cowlishaw. “That Tom Boddington had everybody all cleared out. He was hunting everybody out, black fellows and old Billy Farrer too. He didn’t hit me, but he just hate anybody. “Then we went to Katherine, me and Tom Boddington. Before we left, he put all that arsenic, poison. He poisoned the salt, he poisoned the sugar, he poisoned that box full of tea leaf. “Next morning … they boiled up the tea and when they drank the tea, everyone started vomiting. Everyone vomiting, all that thing, tucker, all had poison, sugar, tea leaf and salt. When we got to Katherine, Tom Boddington told me, ‘You know that Mainoru mob, Billy Farrer went back there? I sang them that song. They’re all here at the hospital. Or might be they all dead now’.” Robinson is saying that Boddington claimed he had been “singing” people, a traditional practice used by powerful law men to enact fatal punishment on wrongdoers. Robinson said he later helped police “lay a trap” to arrest Boddington, and was a police witness. “I went to Katherine court. Then we went to Darwin. War was still on. And I told them about everything, that judge in Darwin. And he shot my uncle too, that Tom Boddington. We went to Alice Springs. I met the Supreme Court there too, and I told them straight. They put Tom Boddington straight in the army. He went to New Guinea fighting, that old Tom Boddington. Just disappeared there now, finish. Might be he got shot now!” Katherine police journals of June 1940 record “investigations re sick natives from Mainoru”, the matter of “Farrer v Boddington” and feeding “Witness Bandicoot” over an extended period. Boddington did enlist in the army, but was discharged in 1942. In another case identified by Smith, the Adelaide Chronicle in 1936 recorded the deaths of five Aboriginal people near Port Keats, who had been deliberately poisoned by a white dingo trapper. No charges were laid. “Poison was used a lot. I’ve come across examples of cooks on stations in the VRD [Victoria River district] steeping tobacco in cyanide and then giving it to Aboriginal workers. Also, distributing poisoned damper.” Smith has been able to verify more than a hundred sites in the Northern Territory from 1827 to the 1920s. There is “so much evidence” of massacres, she says, but it has been “disparate”. To see it all in one place on the map is “seriously depressing, when you realise the scale of it”. Smith says Roper River and the VRD were “very violent places”, where she found the most confronting information. “It was so far from the seat of power and authority – and for the NT, that was Adelaide; the vast majority of our massacres happened on the South Australians’ watch – that it was just lawless. “Pastoralists and overland telegraph officers regularly took the law into their own hands. “I’ve got Paddy Cahill’s own hand, in a letter to the South Australian Register, saying that he engaged in a massacre and saying ‘I don’t know how many I shot, I didn’t stop to count them’,” Smith says. “He was made a Protector of Aborigines. “Technically, massacres were not sanctioned but there was tacit approval and certainly police participation. The Northern Territory was a large place, sparsely populated and governed from distant Adelaide. Later, it was governed from more distant Canberra. There were very few police on the ground to protect the nervous settlers and the land they were progressively plundering.” The research team received a vital piece of original evidence, a letter from a pastoralist on Calvert Downs station in the Gulf country, Bob McKracken, to his sister in Melbourne. This letter says to her: ‘You have no idea what it’s like here, we have to throw the lead around’ and then he goes into details of an 1885 massacre in which he participated. That’s a first-hand account,” Smith says. In the letter, McCracken wrote: “Killing odd ones or even twos or threes is no good, they are never missed and nothing but wholesale slaughter will do any good.” “So people did put it in personal correspondence,” Smith says. “But of course, you know what happens? Someone dies, there’s an old shoebox full of letters, and it gets burnt or thrown out, and that evidence is lost. “But in this case, the family historians held on to it and wanted to make sure that the truth was told.” The Killing Times is based on data from the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project led by Prof Lyndall Ryan at the University of Newcastle’s Centre for the 21st Century Humanities.

3/16/2022,"The UK sports minister has emphasised the importance of the country’s close ties with Saudi Arabia as concerns about the Gulf Kingdom’s dismal human rights record raise awkward questions as to whether its Public Investment Fund (PIF) should have been allowed to buy Newcastle United. Nigel Huddleston’s comments to the digital, culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday may have offered Saudi Media, one of several companies reportedly interested in purchasing Chelsea, tacit encouragement. “The UK’s relationship with Saudi Arabia is really important,” said Huddleston, who maintained the decision to allow PIF to purchase Newcastle was made solely by the Premier League and remained independent of a government he said was unafraid to serve as critical friends of their counterparts in Riyadh. “Saudi Arabia is an important partner of the UK in investment, intelligence and culture. We welcome Saudi Arabian investment. Many, many jobs in the UK are dependent on our relationship with the Saudis but we take the opportunity to talk frankly and openly with Saudi Arabia. We can have frank exchanges because of the nature of our relationship.” Nonetheless Huddleston said the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich by the government and Premier League in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Chelsea owner’s ties to Vladimir Putin had raised the moral bar when it comes to takeovers. “There is a need for a far more robust Premier League owners’ and directors’ test,” said Huddleston. “The integrity element of that is something that’s being pushed.” Although he would not divulge any government plans to implement Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review of the game, Huddleston made clear he broadly endorsed it. “We are at a turning point in English football,” he said. “We recognise there are failures in the structure and governance of English football and the fan-led review is pivotally important because it will contain an independent regulator.” Helen MacNamara, the Premier League’s director of policy and corporate affairs, said England’s top-tier clubs did not want a statutory independent regulator and pointed out there had been no owners’ and directors’ test when Abramovich bought Chelsea. “We already have an independent panel, chaired by a QC who oversees our sanctioning regime, and we’re in the process of putting together an independent panel that will support the Premier League board and scrutinise their decision-making on the owners’ and directors’ test,” she said. Huddleston expects Russia to remain a global sporting “pariah” for some time. The country’s football clubs and national teams have been suspended from all competitions by Fifa and Uefa, and Daniil Medvedev, the world No 1 men’s tennis player, is facing exclusion from key tournaments, Wimbledon included. “As long as Russia continues to be a pariah on the world stage, those sanctions will last,” said Huddleston as the court of arbitration for sport upheld Uefa’s ban on Russian teams as it continues to deliberate on the matter. “The reasons these sporting sanctions matter is because Putin loves nothing better than wrapping himself in the flag and putting himself on the world stage. “I think it’s going to be quite a while before we accept Russia back on to the world sporting stage. I think we can manage perfectly well without Russian investment. I don’t think welcoming it at the moment is morally acceptable.” Asked whether Medvedev would be allowed to compete at Wimbledon this year, Huddleston said he was “in discussions” with the All England Club regarding Russian players. “Absolutely no one flying the Russian flag should be allowed or enabled,” he said. “We need assurances they’re not supporters of Vladimir Putin. There are also visa implications.”",Sport/Football,UK sports minister says relationship with Saudi Arabia is ‘really important’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/15/uk-sports-minister-says-relationship-with-saudi-arabia-is-really-important
