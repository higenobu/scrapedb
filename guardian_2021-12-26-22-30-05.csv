12/26/2021,"The caller who ended a conversation with Joe Biden with the rightwing meme “Let’s go Brandon” – which means “fuck Joe Biden” – has insisted he was joking and meant no disrespect to the president.  “At the end of the day I have nothing against Mr Biden,” Jared Schmeck, 35, told the Oregonian newspaper. “But I am frustrated because I think he can be doing a better job. I mean no disrespect to him.” Schmeck, from Central Point, also said he was not a “Trumper” but rather a “free-thinking American and follower of Jesus Christ”. On Christmas Eve, the president and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, took calls to the North American Aerospace Defense Command Santa Tracker, which each year purports to follow the progress of Santa and his reindeer. A traditional duty for American presidents, in 2018 it was nearly upended when Donald Trump told a seven-year-old belief in Santa Claus was “marginal” at that age. Biden and Schmeck discussed presents Schmeck’s four children were hoping to receive, and how one, Hunter, shared a name with the president’s son and grandson. Schmeck said he was hoping for a “quiet night”. Biden sad: “Lots of luck, dad.” All on the call laughed. At the end of the call, Schmeck said: “Merry Christmas and Let’s go Brandon.” “Let’s go Brandon, I agree,” Biden said, as his wife winced. Biden also said: “By the way are you in Oregon? Where’s your home?” But the call was disconnected. “Let’s go Brandon” originated in an interview with a racing car driver by a TV reporter who may have misheard a crowd’s obscene chant. It has flourished in rightwing and pro-Trump circles – even being promoted by Republican congressmen and the Texas senator Ted Cruz. Schmeck and his wife promoted the remark on social media. But they met with a tide of opprobrium, including a tweet in which the California congressman Eric Swalwell pointed to Biden’s painful personal history. “I refuse to believe we are this indecent as people,” the Democrat wrote. “Not on Christmas Eve. And not to a person who lost his wife and daughter at Christmastime. We are better than this. Be kind and Merry Christmas.” Schmeck, a former police officer, told the Oregonian he was “being attacked for utilising my freedom of speech”. He also said he had received some potentially threatening phone calls of his own. “I understand there is a vulgar meaning to ‘Lets go Brandon’ but I’m not that simple-minded, no matter how I feel about him,” Schmeck said. “[Biden] seems likes he’s a cordial guy. There’s no animosity or anything like that. It was merely just an innocent jest to also express my God-given right to express my frustrations in a joking manner.” Schmeck said subjects stoking those frustrations with Biden included vaccine mandates and supply chain problems. He also insisted: “I love him just like I love any other brother or sister.”",News/US news,‘Let’s go Brandon’ Santa Tracker caller insists he meant no disrespect to Biden,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/26/lets-go-brandon-santa-tracker-caller-joe-biden
12/26/2021,"China has replaced the Communist party official widely associated with a security crackdown targeting ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in the far-west region of Xinjiang. The state-owned Xinhua news agency said in a brief announcement on Saturday that Ma Xingrui, the governor of the coastal economic powerhouse Guangdong province since 2017, had replaced Chen Quanguo as the Xinjiang party chief. Chen will move to another role.  The change came amid a wider reshuffle ahead of next year’s 20th party congress, scheduled for the autumn. It is not clear whether the move signals a rethink in China’s overall approach to Xinjiang. Beijing would be sensitive to any interpretation that it was bowing to international pressure. Some Chinese observers have noted Chen may be promoted further during the party congress. Others say his replacement, Ma, may focus more on the region’s economic development. Chen, 66, was appointed party secretary of Xinjiang in 2016. He is one of the 25 members of China’s politburo and was placed on a sanctions list last year by the US. On Thursday, Joe Biden signed into law a ban on imports from Xinjiang over Washington’s concerns about forced labour. Beijing condemned the move. Rights groups and the United Nations say about 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslims have been detained in re-education camps in Xinjiang in the name of combating religious extremism and terrorism. Since 2017, Beijing’s policy in the province has faced fierce criticism from abroad. Some western lawmakers and parliamentarians have described China’s treatment of the Uyghurs as genocidal – a charge Beijing denies. There have also been calls for a boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics in February. Chen’s replacement, 62-year-old Ma, has a background in the aerospace industry. Before becoming governor of Guangdong he served as the party boss in Shenzhen from 2015.",News/World news, China replaces Xinjiang party boss associated with Uyghur crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/china-replaces-xinjiang-party-boss-associated-uyghur-crackdown
12/26/2021,"Jonathan Taylor was pleased by his first peek at a sparkling new studio apartment that could one day become his home. The 24-year-old from Exeter has been living in YMCA accommodation since he was 19 but, as he viewed freshly painted white walls, the reality of a more settled home dawned. “If I lived in this place I’d feel more important,” he said. “I’d feel I’ve landed on my feet.”  Taylor, who juggles cleaning jobs at a builders’ merchant and a pub, is a victim of what many fear is a deepening housing crisis in the Devon cathedral city fuelled by surging house prices, the spread of short-term Airbnb lets and rising social waiting lists. It means the chance to rent a decent, affordable home like the one Taylor is viewing is vanishingly rare. The fact Taylor may soon be given a chance to move in is down to YMCA Exeter, which is converting a former Poundstretcher warehouse into 26 homes for priced-out young people for a £140-a-week rent – well below the market rate. The small attempt at a solution comes as Exeter and many other parts of the UK are facing a new challenge to further complicate the housing crisis: the arrival of metropolitan homebuyers seeking more space and less stress. Pandemic exiles are selling up high-value homes in places such as London and snapping up bigger properties for a fraction of the price. Latest figures show that Londoners bought more than 112,000 homes outside the capital this year, an increase of 62% compared with 2020, according to the estate agent Hamptons. They spent £54.9bn, the highest annual spend on record, reflecting soaring property prices, which have been lifted by the government’s temporary cut to stamp duty. The average UK house price has risen from £450,460 in 2020 to £486,890 in 2021. “It is getting tense,” said Rob Hannaford, leader of the Labour group of Devon county council. “People coming down with big budgets is causing anger and resentment.” Exeter is among several UK areas that have become honeypots for city people who decided during the lockdowns that another life must be possible. House prices are surging too in Richmondshire in North Yorkshire, Pembrokeshire in west Wales, and the Scottish borders. Cities such as Exeter are seeing already threadbare supplies of affordable housing pushed to breaking point. “Local people can’t get anywhere in the system,” said Hannaford. “People from London are coming in and putting in a ridiculous offer over the asking price and getting what they want. These might not be houses that local people could afford, but it does trickle down.” Exeter’s social waiting list grew 47% from 2017 to 2020 to reach about 2,600 households. House prices went up 8.5% in the last year. Meanwhile the population grows, more properties become second homes and private landlords increasingly switch long-term rentals to short-stay Airbnbs. The pressure is such that Hannaford said the council was even concerned about how to find homes for 67 Afghan refugees currently in a hotel after this summer’s evacuation from Kabul. Attracting social workers, teachers and care workers is becoming harder. There is a plan to build 500 council homes but it is playing catch-up. Blaming the arrival of outsiders may not be entirely fair given the affordable housing crisis in Exeter has been brewing for years. Landlords have bought up swathes of stock to rent to students and, in a nationally recurrent theme, there is public opposition to construction on the surrounding green fields. Newcomers resist any suggestion they are causing a problem and some stressed they wanted to become part of the community and contribute with their different skills and experience. “The pandemic and lockdown gave us some unexpectedly clarity,” said Sabrina Russo, who moved from London to Exeter with her family in December 2020. “We realised that a bigger home, time outdoors and a slower pace had become real priorities … Exeter is friendly and welcoming and we’ve started to meet people and make friends. We bought a house that we love.” But, said Laura Wright, the Exeter city councillor in charge of council housing and deputy leader, there was “growing alarm at the prices that some people are willing and able to pay to move here from London”. “As a nation, we have been locked into a way of thinking and acting over the last 20 years which values making the biggest profit possible above collective responsibility for social cohesion and welfare.” The sharpest house price rises in the year to August have been in desirable, more spacious locations outside the major cities where there have also been substantial increases in people waiting for social housing. The list includes Wychavon, Stratford-upon-Avon, County Durham, Cheshire West and Newark and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire. In these places, average house prices rose between 13% and 20% in a year while waiting lists have lengthened over the last three years. “My age group is being pushed out of the city,” said Natalie Overson, a 23-year-old who aspires to be a midwife and has been on Exeter’s social housing waiting list for five years. “A lot of it is people buying second homes, or buying to rent out. It is the middle and upper classes that are making it harder for us to live in the cities we grew up in.” Becky Merriman, 34, a youth worker, has been unable find a rental home in Exeter, which means she has to commute 40 minutes each way and continue to live with her parents. “I’ve been trying since May and it has been quite traumatic,” she said. “We would ring agents as soon as a property went up [online] and they would say the viewings were all gone in 10 minutes. It’s mentally exhausting.” In West Devon, which includes half of Dartmoor, house prices have risen 20% in the last year and 800 households are waiting for social housing. “We as a local authority have got to be building houses,” said Neil Jory, West Devon’s Conservative leader, who added that people moving from London and Bristol was “causing us a great deal of concern”. “There are cases in Devon where teachers have come to the county to work and three months later they have gone back to where they came from because they can’t afford anywhere to live.”",News/Society,Home-seekers despair as affordable property vanishes from UK hotspots,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/26/home-seekers-despair-as-affordable-property-vanishes-from-uk-hotspots

12/26/2021,"Abusy, busy year for audio. As in 2020, lockdown gave all audio a boost – in status, as well as listeners. The lack of gigs, theatre, art shows or cinema from January to March meant that audio (radio, podcasts, music) jumped up the cultural ladder. Podcasts were also boosted by yet more celebrities deciding to fill their lonelier hours with a “talking to my famous mates” show. Listeners responded, and podcasts are now the fastest growing audio medium (though live radio still makes up most of what we listen to).  2021 saw some interesting big-name radio appointments. Emma Barnett and Anita Rani joined Woman’s Hour to great success, though the former started contentiously (Kelechi Okafor refused to appear when she overheard Barnett discussing with producers whether Okafor was antisemitic). Amol Rajan moved to Today, where he has brought a more conversational feel (when he remembers to slow down his natural gabble). In late spring, much-loved Radio 1 stalwarts Annie MacManus and Nick Grimshaw both announced their departures, with MacManus’s final link achieving a life of its own on social media (“Life is short. It thunders by. If you like the music, you have got to get up and dance. Just do it”). And 6 Music’s afternoon dafty Shaun Keaveny also left, but sadly not of his own accord: his funky replacement, Craig Charles, is upbeat but less of a natural fit. Graham Norton quit his Radio 2 Saturday morning show to do the same on Saturdays and Sundays for Virgin Radio (no effect on Virgin’s Rajars thus far). On 5 live breakfast, Rick Edwards joined Rachel Burden, replacing Nicky Campbell without fuss or trouble. In March, the BBC announced a gradual but compulsory move to the regions. Much of this Big Shift About meant changes for radio production teams: Newsbeat journalists are off to Birmingham, technology hacks to Glasgow, and more of Radio 3 and 6 Music’s output must come from outside the capital (Charles’s show is based in Salford). Several old-timers, including the brilliant technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, chose to retire rather than move. In commercial radio, niche is still king, with Boom Radio, which launched in February, aiming for the sixtysomethings, and Greatest Hits for the uncool Gen X-ers (the likes of Alex Lester and Mark Goodier were joined by Simon Mayo in March). Times Radio has done well in its first year (around 640,000 weekly listeners), offering a sparky alternative to Radio 4 and 5 live. Outside radio, big corporations are getting serious about our ears. Spotify gave us podcasts from genuine midlife superstars Barack and Bruce (Renegades), the UK’s greatest YouTubers, the Sidemen (The Fellas, What’s Good With Miniminter and Randolph) and the most popular podcaster in the world (Joe Rogan). Its reward was to overtake Apple and BBC Sounds as the most popular podcast platform for younger audiences. Audible, known for audiobooks, has quietly been making some gripping UK podcasts, including investigative shows Finding Q, Death at Deepcut, and inventive dramas such as the Jed Mercurio-exec’d Zoetrope. Wondery, reliable banger-out of US true crime, added some UK shows this year, such as the excellent Harsh Reality. With big corporations comes big money: in June, US-celebrities-interviewing-their-mates show Smartless was bought for a reputed $80m by Amazon Music, which also snapped up Wondery. But amid all these dollar signs, the question is whether there’s enough advertising revenue to support the independent podcast sector. Some excellent shows are finding it harder to secure those all-important mattress/ bush-trimmer/ website design ads, as they’re all being hoovered up by, you guessed it, new celebrity shows. Still, there is no doubt that since lockdown 2020, audio has boomed. Expect even more next year. 1.

12/26/2021,"Christmas 1941 was grim. Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor earlier in the month and its armies were advancing across the Pacific. Hitler’s advance into the Soviet Union had taken the Wehrmacht to the gates of Moscow. Britain had become used to short rations and long nights of the Blitz. Optimism for the year ahead was in short supply. Yet by the end of 1942 the mood had changed. The Germans were bogged down at Stalingrad and being pushed back in North Africa. America, mobilising its full economic power, had turned the tide in the Pacific. The publication of the Beveridge report in December 1942 came at just the right time: when confidence was growing not just that the second world war would be won but that it would be a catalyst for building back better.  Like 1941, 2021 has ended on a low note. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has proved to be highly transmissible, dampening consumer confidence and prompting governments to reimpose restrictions on economic activity. Living standards – while substantially higher than eight decades ago – are being eroded by rising inflation. Even without tougher official curbs, the next few months are going to be characterised by weak growth, squeezed incomes and higher taxes. Clearly, a return to lockdowns as severe as those of last winter would make matters worse. Things are likely to improve as 2022 wears on. The early evidence is that Omicron poses less of a health threat than the Delta variant and more people will be protected by booster vaccines. That, though, is not really the issue. By the end of 1942, it was obvious not just that the war would eventually be won but that solutions were being found for the problems of the years leading up to the war during the 1930s: mass unemployment, financial crises, a breakdown in international cooperation and entrenched poverty. It would be a stretch to say the same applies now, in part because governments are trying to build back better on the cheap and in part because the rich and powerful at the top of the pile are keen for things to stay pretty much the same as they are. This, as Kevin Gallagher and Richard Kozul-Wright make clear in their book, The Case for a New Bretton Woods (Polity books), is a key difference between today’s world and that of the 1940s. The roots go back some years earlier to the start of the 1930s and Roosevelt’s New Deal. They say the plan drawn up by the US president after the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression was a genuine “build back better” programme. As the second world war was approaching its final stages, the construction of a new international economic system at Bretton Woods in 1944 – the conference in New Hampshire that gave birth to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – was Washington’s attempt to internationalise the New Deal. Crucially, big finance was noticeable by its absence at Bretton Woods and this was no accident because Wall Street was still on the naughty step after blowing up the economy in the late 1920s. Gallagher and Kozul-Wright note: “The New Deal programme not only abandoned the gold standard, but also broke with the wider liberal international agenda by taking on the financial elite both at home and abroad, and opened the door to an alternative narrative in support of an activist public policy agenda.” The contrast with today is stark. It is barely a decade since the egregious behaviour of poorly regulated banks brought the global economy to the brink of a second Great Depression, yet the wealth, power and influence of capital has barely been touched in the years since. Big finance was not invited to Bretton Woods but it was crawling all over last month’s Cop26 climate change conference in Glasgow. So what lessons can be learned from the original New Deal that would make “build back better” more than a soundbite? Firstly, Roosevelt legislated to alter the balance of power between labour and capital. The Wagner Act of 1935 gave employees the right to organise trade unions, while the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 separated investment from commercial banks. The final quarter of the 20th century saw the opposite: curbs on trade unions, more power for finance. Secondly, governments on both sides of the Atlantic raised taxes on the rich rather than burden working people with the cost of bringing down the public debt accumulated as a result of the depression and the war. Roosevelt’s Revenue Act of 1935 was steeply progressive and levied a top rate of income tax of 75% on those earning more than $1m a year. The Clement Attlee government in the UK demonstrated its preference for taxing unearned rather than earned income by whacking up estate duty (the forerunner of inheritance tax). As Andrew Percy, of UCL’s Institute for Global Prosperity shows in a recent paper, similar choices could be made today. Percy has proposed a single tax system, in which income tax and national insurance are merged and in which passive incomes (such as gains from investing in the stock market) are taxed at the same rate as incomes. It would mean a tax cut of over £1,000 a year for a typical factory worker on £24,000 a year, or £10 a week for the typical social care worker on £18,000 a year, he calculates, and 88% of all taxpayers would be paying less. The final piece of the New Deal jigsaw was the system of capital controls, which made it harder for the rich to shift their wealth offshore, reduced the risk of financial crises and allowed countries to pursue full employment policies without being blown off course by hot money flows. There are those who say reintroducing curbs on capital are inconceivable in the 21st century. Yet two years ago it was inconceivable that modern democracies would keep their populations under house arrest. If governments can shackle people they can shackle money.",News/Business,A post-Covid New Deal can restore economic hope in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/a-post-covid-new-deal-can-restore-economic-hope-in-2022
12/26/2021,"Crystal Palace will be without Patrick Vieira in the dugout for the Boxing Day trip to Tottenham Hotspur after the manager tested positive for Covid-19. The latest blow for Palace comes after the club failed in their attempt to get the 3pm GMT kick-off called off because of an outbreak of the virus in their squad. Palace were in discussions with the Premier League on Christmas Day about postponing their trip across the capital following a number of new positive cases, but it is understood the league were dissatisfied with the late application.  Palace tweeted: “We can confirm that Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira is self-isolating after returning a positive test for Covid-19, and will be absent from the touchline for today’s match against Spurs. Assistant manager Osian Roberts will deputise for Vieira for today’s match.” Vieira revealed on Christmas Eve that there were a “couple of cases”, but the increase over the following 48 hours was not deemed enough to see the game cancelled. The Premier League announced last week that a game will be played if a team has 13 fit outfield players and a goalkeeper. Three games scheduled for Sunday have been called off on account of the virus. Leeds v Liverpool and Wolves v Watford went on Thursday and Everton’s trip to Burnley had to be postponed the following day. The impact of Covid on the Premier League was underlined on Saturday when Aston Villa said Steven Gerrard would miss their next two games after the head coach tested positive. Vieira had warned on Friday that the Palace game could be under threat. “We had a couple of cases in our football club in the last couple of days,” the manager said. “We try our best to prevent and avoid a situation but it is worrying because we don’t know how the next couple of days will go.” Palace’s last scheduled match, against Watford last weekend, was postponed because of a Covid-19 outbreak in their opponents’ squad.",Sport/Football,Crystal Palace fail to get Spurs match called off despite positive test for Vieira,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/26/patrick-vieira-spurs-crystal-palace-boxing-day-covid-19-football-premier-league
