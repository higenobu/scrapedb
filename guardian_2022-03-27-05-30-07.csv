3/27/2022,"In a speech in Poland on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Joe Biden indicated his intent to re-position the US as a leader in global affairs after four years of disengagement during the Trump administration. It is not a task many thought Biden would so firmly take on when he took office in 2021. Initially, Biden focused on healing domestic wounds following four chaotic years of the Trump administration and the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic. But Biden’s speech in Poland appeared designed to signal a shift in US policy and a generational call to arms for democratic countries to unite against autocracy in a years-long foreign policy project, with the US at its head. “In this battle, we need to be clear eyed,” said Biden. “This battle will not be won in days or months, either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.” That unity, Biden signaled, would need to include democracies that have at times been at odds with one another. The sweeping speech ended with a call for “a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light”. The president used the speech to draw historical parallels between the war in Ukraine, which began a month ago when Russian forces invaded, to the second world war; moments symbolic of freedom including the fall of the Berlin Wall; and the words of Pope John Paul II, who was Polish and who told the world: “Be not afraid.” In its sweep and scope, the speech had echoes of other major foreign policy addresses given by US presidents on European soil, such as Ronald Reagan’s “tear down this wall” speech in Berlin in 1987 and John F Kennedy’s Ich bin ein Berliner call in 1963. “All of us, including here in Poland, must do the hard work of democracy each and every day – in my country as well. That’s why I came to Europe again this week,” said Biden. “For all freedom-loving nations, we must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul.” Biden highlighted the US commitment to Ukraine and Nato, including a pledge to defend “every inch of Nato territory with the full force of our collective power”. The US and allies “maintain absolute unity – we must, among the world’s democracies”, he said. “This is the task of our time. The task of this generation,” the president said about the fight against autocracy. The speech was a far cry from one of Biden’s earliest foreign policy decisions – to follow through with the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. In August 2021, the administration began an urgent evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies, after the capital, Kabul, fell to the Taliban in a matter of days. “I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Biden said in August 2021. Biden also used the speech to highlight commitments he said showed “the people of Ukraine can count on the United States”, including accepting 100,000 refugees and providing $300m in humanitarian aid and thousands of tons of food, water and medicine. Biden called Vladimir Putin a “tyrant” and appealed directly to the Russian people. He invoked the struggles of the second world war, including the siege of Leningrad, which would be “fresh in the memory of many grandparents”. “You, the Russian people, are not our enemy,” said Biden. “I refuse to believe you welcome the killing of innocent children and grandparents, or that you accept hospitals, schools, maternity wards – for God’s sake – being pummeled with Russian missiles and bombs.” “These are not memories past,” said Biden. “This is exactly what the Russian army is doing to Ukraine right now.”",News/US news,Biden summons history in sweeping call for renewed alliance of democracies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/joe-biden-poland-speech-russia-ukraine-nato
3/27/2022,"Joe Biden condemned Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland as Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine’s most pro-western city, just 40 miles from the Polish border. With explosions erupting across neighbouring Lviv, in a clear act of defiance from the Kremlin, Biden told an audience in Warsaw that the west must steel itself “for a long fight ahead”. In what seemed to be a dramatic shift in US policy to back regime change in Moscow, Biden also appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin. “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said in his most belligerent speech since the war began a month ago. US officials later said that Biden had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. The American leader said Putin was “bent on violence”. Addressing the Russian president directly, Biden said: “Don’t even think about moving on to one single inch of Nato territory.” “There is simply no justification or provocation for Russia’s choice of war,” Biden told the audience in the Polish presidential palace. “It’s an example of one of the oldest human impulses, using brute force and disinformation to satisfy a craving for absolute power and control. It’s nothing less than a direct challenge to the rule-based international order established since the end of world war two.” The attacks on Lviv, the home of Ukrainian nationalism and a key player in the country’s break from the Soviet Union, bring the war directly to the European Union’s doorstep. At least five people were injured from six missile strikes in two waves and black smoke billowed over the historic city’s horizon of steeples and cathedral domes as a fuel storage facility was hit, a mile from the Unesco-protected world heritage site. A second target was a defence facility; both were close to residential areas. The timing of the attacks, only the third on west Ukrainian targets since the war began, and the closest to Lviv’s city centre and its residential areas, was clearly designed to send a message to the White House. Hours earlier, Biden had met Ukraine’s defence and foreign ministers for the first time since Putin announced his “special military operation” on 24 February, and offered extra military support. Lviv’s mayor Andriy Sadovyi said one target hit by the Russians had been “infrastructure object” and “we are putting out a fire” but declined to comment further. Sadovyi said the explosions were a way of “saying hello to President Biden” who was in Poland. “The good thing is that nobody was killed,’ he added. Air raid sirens continued through the night sending Lviv civilians scurrying into underground shelters. “We emerged anew in the great battle for freedom,” Biden said in his speech. “The battle between democracy and autocracy. Between liberty and repression. Between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force. “This battle will not be won in days or months,” he added. “We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead.” Referencing Pope John Paul II’s “be not afraid” speech of 1979 at the beginning and end, Biden’s speech linked the war in Ukraine with historic moments of Eastern European defiance against Soviet aggression. “The battle for democracy did not conclude with the fall of the Berlin Wall,” Biden said. “Today Russia has strangled democracy and sought to do so elsewhere, not just in its homeland.” Asked by reporters what seeing Ukrainian refugees at Stadion Narodowy earlier in the day had made him think of as he deals with Putin, Biden replied: “He’s a butcher.” The Kremlin had hinted on Friday that it may be scaling back its war ambitions, saying it was close to completing the “first phase” of its military campaign and would now focus on the complete “liberation” of Donbas in eastern Ukraine. But the attacks on Lviv, 250 miles from where Biden was speaking, offered little evidence of any such plan. Speaking to the Observer, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodomyr Zelenskiy and the lead negotiator in talks with Russia, said he did not believe the Kremlin was downgrading its war aims. “They had poor operational planning, and they realised it was advantageous for them to surround cities, cut off the main supply routes, and force people there to have a deficit of food, water and medicines,” he said, describing the siege of Mariupol as a tactic to sow psychological terror and exhaustion. Podolyak expressed scepticism over the Russian defence ministry’s claims that Moscow’s forces would now focus mainly on the Donbas area in east Ukraine. “Of course I don’t believe that. They don’t have interests in Donbas. Their main interests are Kyiv, Chernihiv, Kharkiv and the south – to take Mariupol, and to close the Azov Sea … we see them regrouping and preparing more troops to send in,” he said. Podolyak later tweeted: “Lviv. Massive missile strikes. Another big Ukrainian city with great historical value. Near the border. Embassies of many countries inside the city. But the barbarians of the Russian Federation are not interested in anything - no history, no heritage, no foreign diplomas / missions. Will Europe continue to ‘pacify’?” Earlier in the day, the Kremlin had raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine as Russian forces struggled to hold a key city in the south of the country. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is deputy chairman of the country’s security council, said Moscow could strike against an enemy that only used conventional weapons while Vladimir Putin’s defence minster Sergei Shoigu claimed nuclear “readiness” was a priority. The comments prompted Zelenskiy, appearing by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world. “Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” he said. Russia has about 6,000 nuclear warheads – the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world. Medvedev said Russia’s nuclear doctrine did not require an enemy state to use such weapons first. Russia could use a nuclear deterrent in response to “an act of aggression committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardised the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.” Shoigu, who had not been seen for 12 days before a brief appearance on Friday and an address to his generals on Saturday, also spoke about the nuclear threat contained within Russia’s arsenal. In a video, uploaded on social media by the Russian defence ministry, Shoigu said the maintenance of “engagement readiness of strategic nuclear forces” was a priority. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence ministry said Russia was increasingly using undercover sabotage and reconnaissance groups in the Kyiv region after the failure to take the capital by conventional means. “The saboteurs change into civilian clothes and use cars stolen from the civilian population,” a spokesperson said.",News/US news,Biden: ‘butcher’ Putin cannot be allowed to stay in power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/biden-butcher-putin-cannot-be-allowed-to-stay-in-power
3/27/2022,"Last Saturday, Zenit St Petersburg beat Arsenal Tula 3-0 to stretch their lead at the top of the Russian Premier League over Dynamo Moscow to five points. Dynamo, managed by the German Sandro Schwarz, needed a last-minute penalty to salvage a draw at home to Rostov, while in Nizhny Novgorod, the Italian coach Paolo Vanoli threw on Victor Moses at half-time as his Spartak Moscow side drew 1-1. But this is another world now. Foreign involvement lingers, but these are games that feel as if they are happening in a different reality. There will almost certainly be no European football for Russian clubs next season. Spartak have been expelled from this season’s Europa League. Russia did not play their World Cup playoff against Poland on Thursday. The Russian Football Union can take whatever action it wants at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, apply to host whatever tournaments, but it is largely academic given it seems unlikely that any but a handful of Uefa members would countenance games against Russian opponents even if the ban imposed on them were lifted. When Russia invaded Ukraine there was an immediate exodus of foreign players and coaches. The German Markus Gisdol quit Lokomotiv Moscow after six months in charge. Daniel Farke hadn’t even overseen a game with Krasnodar before he felt compelled to resign. “We formed a great community with different nationalities in a very short time, who wanted to pursue sporting goals together – with joy and fun,” he said. “Unfortunately, the serious side of life has now caught up with us.” While others remain – Zenit’s goals were scored by Brazilians, Malcom (two) and Yuri Alberto – slowly the serious side of life is catching up with everybody. A handful of players made awkward trips for international duty – Zenit’s Colombian midfielder Wilmar Barrios, for instance, travelled via Turkey and Panama for Thursday’s 3-0 win over Bolivia – but some may not return. Krasnodar have found their local airport closed to civil traffic and so have to make at least part of the journey for away games by rail – a significant consideration in a country as big as Russia. Ukrainian players have been forced to leave, something Fifa has facilitated by an amendment to contract regulations. The defender Yaroslav Rakitskyi, dropped by Zenit after posting a pro-Ukraine message on Instagram, soon terminated his contract by mutual consent. Andriy Voronin, the former Liverpool striker, quit as assistant coach of Dynamo, but Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, Ukraine’s most-capped player, remains as assistant at Zenit despite being stripped of his coaching licence by the Ukrainian Association of Football. Russians playing overseas have been broadly unaffected: Aleksei Miranchuk is still at Atalanta, despite playing alongside the Ukrainian Ruslan Malinovskyi; Aleksandr Golovin started Monaco’s 3-0 win over Paris Saint-Germain last week; Nikita Khaykin remains Bodø/Glimt’s first-choice keeper. But who now would sign for a Russian club? And what club would sign, or be able to sign, a Russian player? Although all four FA Cup quarter-finals, the Clásico and the Superclásico could all be watched last weekend, the Premier League and Ligue 1 are no longer broadcast in Russia. It’s largely symbolic, but it only enhances a sense of isolation – and isolation in football, even before globalisation, has only ever led to regression. Argentina emerged from a decade of Peronist isolation to lose 6-1 to Czechoslovakia at the 1958 World Cup; even six years out of European competition post-Heysel set English football back significantly. The trajectory for Russian football has been down for some time now. In 2005, CSKA Moscow, backed by Sibneft, became the first Russian side to win a major European trophy by lifting the Uefa Cup. Sibneft became Gazprom and shifted interest to Zenit, who won the competition in 2008. A month later, that side formed the core of a Russia national team that, playing thrilling football, beat the Netherlands to reach the semi-finals of the Euros. Russia, it seemed, was emerging as a major football nation. There were other flurries of investment, most notably in 2011 when the billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, a close ally of Vladimir Putin who had borrowed billions of dollars from state banks to invest in Gazprom and the fertiliser producer Uralkali, bought Anzhi Makhachkala. He signed Samuel Eto’o, Roberto Carlos and Christopher Samba and appointed Guus Hiddink as coach, only be forced to slash the budget after Uralkali’s attempt to breakaway from a cartel of companies led to a collapse in the price of potash. But Russia never had a better tournament than 2008 and their clubs never built on the successes of CSKA and Zenit. The Financial Fair Play regulations implemented in 2011 – at least in part as a reaction from the traditional elites against what Roman Abramovich had done at Chelsea – limited what even the richest oligarchs could achieve. But there is perhaps anyway a ceiling on what can be done with money alone, at least in the short-term. The very best players and the very best coaches still, by and large, preferred to live in western Europe and play for western European clubs. In terms of the Uefa coefficient, the Russian league’s best season came in 2017-18, conveniently just before the World Cup – but that was essentially a technicality based on Europa League results. Interest had already begun to wane, while investment had been hit even by the limited sanctions that followed Russian incursions into Crimea and Donbas in 2014. That was especially so at CSKA, whose long-term president, Evgeny Giner, had significant business interests in Ukraine. Perhaps Gazprom, its sponsorship of Uefa over, will invest domestically, but with the fall in the value of the rouble and sanctions biting, who in Russia now has money to spend on football? In Russia there is a curious sense of suspension. There are no games for the national side this week but the league ticks on. The crash, though, is coming. Compared to what is happening in Ukraine, of course, that is an irrelevance, but football, as the most global of sports, perhaps serves as a case study for other aspects of Russian life. And the reality is that for now, and the immediate future, Russian football is over.",Sport/Football,Football in Russia is crashing and isolation can only hasten its decline,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/26/football-in-russia-is-crashing-and-isolation-can-only-hasten-its-decline
3/27/2022,"When the Swedish referee, Andreas Ekberg, was advised by the VAR to consult the pitchside monitor, everybody knew what was coming. And it was the same with Harry Kane, when he addressed the subsequent penalty. Hard and low into the bottom corner, Kane had his 49th England goal, Wayne Rooney’s record of 53 getting ever nearer. And England had a slightly streaky victory over a Switzerland team who might have been two goals in front before Luke Shaw’s equaliser on 45 minutes. The penalty was the big talking point and it was one to make Switzerland and their substitute, Steven Zuber, feel sore. Zuber had jumped for a corner with his back to the ball and, although his arm was away from his body, he knew very little about it when Marc Guéhi, the England debutant, thudded a header into it. And so England picked up where they had left off last November, when they secured their qualification to the World Cup with wins over Albania and San Marino. The momentum remains with them – they have now lost just once in 21 matches – even if there were holes in this performance, mainly in the first half. Switzerland had gone in front through Breel Embolo and it was at this point that England came to wobble. They would be indebted to Jordan Pickford, who made one especially fine save to deny Fabian Frei. Shaw’s goal was the turning point and what a strike it was, a left-footed first time effort that had shades of his finish in the Euro 2020 final against Italy, albeit from further out. It felt a little startling to realise that this was the first of only three Wembley matches for England before the World Cup and, if it was a friendly, then good for both nations. The alternative was that they would most likely have been involved in the World Cup playoffs. As it was, the big crowd could relax and enjoy the show. That was the theory. Gareth Southgate’s selection is rarely simple and, after the raft of withdrawals from his squad, he had to cope with the loss of John Stones to an injury in the warm-up. Ben White stepped in for him in the back three – and it was always going to be a back three, given how Southgate had doubled down on the tactic in last November’s away game against San Marino. White will not enjoy the inquest into the breakthrough goal, which came hard on the heels of Granit Xhaka extending Pickford with a low drive from outside the area on 22 minutes. White appeared to be unaware of Embolo in behind him and, when he woke up, it was too late. Xherdan Shaqiri dropped over a lovely cross; Embolo’s headed finish was clinical. In the previous phase of play, Silvan Widmer had looked to have broken into an offside position but it was not spotted. The experimentation from Southgate was there at the outset and it involved a switch to 3-5-2 – the formation that he had used at the 2018 World Cup – with Conor Gallagher, on his first start, and Mason Mount as driving No 8s and a new role up front for Phil Foden. The Manchester City player had plenty of licence to drift or drop into deeper areas. Gallagher, meanwhile, pushed high and, from a Kane pass in the 14th minute, he cut inside and shaped a curler for the far corner. Widmer headed clear and it did not look as though the goalkeeper, Jonas Omlin, would have got across. Embolo’s goal ignited a purple patch for his team while England were unnerved, particularly at the back, where White struggled and the spaces were pronounced, particularly between the debutant, Guéhi, at left centre-back and Shaw at left wing-back. Shaqiri enjoyed himself and he saw one shot deflect out for a corner. From it, Frei unloaded a half-volley of vicious power that Pickford did superbly to tip up and against the crossbar. England scrambled to safety and they would be reprieved again when, following another Switzerland corner, Ricardo Rodriguez worked Pickford with a swerving drive from distance. Embolo might have done better on the rebound only to drag his shot. England needed something and, out of nothing, they got it in first-half stoppage time. Foden pressed Frei towards the corner flag and the defender’s risky pass was intercepted by a stretching Kyle Walker-Peters, another England debutant. The ball broke for Gallagher and, when his low cross ran through for Shaw, the finish was explosive. Omlin – in for Yann Sommer, who has Covid – felt it fizz past him. The mood around the Switzerland set-up has been positive under the new manager, Murat Yakin, who replaced Vladimir Petkovic after the Euro finals, when his team had lost on penalties to Spain in the quarter-finals. Yakin’s record before kick-off showed four wins and three draws from seven fixtures. Two of the draws were against Italy in World Cup qualification and they helped to secure Switzerland’s progress as group winners and condemn Italy to the playoffs, where we all know what happened. Did Switzerland expect to qualify automatically ahead of the European champions? No. Did that make it all the sweeter? Absolutely. Gallagher played with a rare fearlessness. There were times when Jordan Henderson looked a little exposed in front of the defence, which Southgate would have hated, but Gallagher was determined to express himself, to make the difference in an attacking sense. He played a nice, chipped through ball for Kane early in the second half, from which the captain worked Omlin, and Guéhi went close with a header from the corner. Enter the substitutes, one of which was Tyrick Mitchell for his debut at left-back. Southgate shuffled again, moving to 4-2-3-1, with Foden as the No 10. White went to right-back and he would lash a drive just high on 72 minutes. Foden would later be replaced by Jude Bellingham as Southgate finished in a 4-3-3. White did well in his new role and it was his cross that deflected out for the decisive corner. Conor Coady would be denied at the very end but England had done enough.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane penalty secures England’s comeback win over Switzerland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/26/england-switzerland-international-friendly-match-report
3/27/2022,"The husband of one of the Tory party’s biggest donors has claimed he earned up to £42m a year in Russia and had business dealings with the now-sanctioned oligarchs Roman Abramovich and Oleg Deripaska. Vladimir Chernukhin, 53, husband of the Tory donor Lubov Chernukhin, used his position in the Russian elite to cultivate influential business contacts while investing in private ventures, according to court documents. Chernukhin, who served as deputy finance minister early in Vladimir Putin’s first presidency, transferred assets to the west after falling out of favour with the Russian regime. Chernukhin’s wife, Lubov, 49, has donated nearly £2.2m to the Conservative party. Labour has called on the Tories to donate any Russian-linked political donations to Ukrainian humanitarian causes. A 78-page witness statement, written by Russian-born Chernukhin for a 2018 high court case against oligarch Oleg Deripaska, details how he built his fortune and networked with some of his country’s richest oligarchs. It discloses that he built a personal investment portfolio while working in “official roles”, including chairman of the now-sanctioned Russian state development corporation VEB.RF. Chernukhin says in the statement: “In the relevant period up to 2004, it was widely accepted that those who held public positions such as mine would also be interested in projects in the private sector. Some discretion was required … but the reality was that I (along with many other people at my level in the Russian Federation) held many private interests… “My time at VEB and in government elevated me to the inner circles of the Russian establishment, opened up an array of high-level connections for me and deepened my knowledge of the Russian economy.” He said he invested in projects in a variety of sectors, often as joint shareholder with “prominent members of the Russian economic establishment”. In evidence in the high court in December 2018, he confirmed that he “was doing business with people like Abramovich, Deripaska, [Andrey] Melnichenko.” He said: “We were like friends. And we knew everything about each other, especially because all of us came from Soviet Union with zero money in the pocket.” Abramovich, Deripaska and Melnichenko have all been sanctioned by the UK government. Melnichenko was worth an estimated £11bn before the Ukraine invasion and his €530m (£441m) super yacht was seized this month by the Italian authorities. According to Chernukhin’s statement, when he left VEB in 2004 after being dismissed by Putin, his annual income for that year was $55m (£42m), on which he paid tax of about $1.5m (£1.1m). Trustees were required to oversee his investments when he was in ministerial office. The case involved a dispute over the ownership of a valuable piece of land in Moscow. The judge found Chernukhin was a legitimate investor and a joint venture partner with Deripaska. There is no suggestion Chernukhin acted unlawfully in his business dealings in Russia. Chernukhin amassed his fortune in a career that included working for trade houses run by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and VEB. He was deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation for two years from April 2000, then became chairman of VEB. He was also a board member of major Russian companies, including the state-owned airline Aeroflot. He left for England in 2004, fearing he might be the victim of bogus charges and political persecution. He said he was close to former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov, now a Putin critic and opposition figure. It has been previously reported that financial documents suggest Chernukhin left the country with assets of about $500m (£366m). Chernukhin married Lubov, a former banking consultant, in 2007. Her donations to the Conservatives include successful auction bids for tennis with Boris Johnson and a dinner party with Theresa May. Her large donations helped secure her membership of a Conservative party “advisory board” for major donors which provides regular access to the prime minister and chancellor. The Pandora papers leak, which exposed the finances of the super-rich, suggested Lubov Chernukhin’s money flowed, at least in part, from her husband’s corporate structures. A document sent in 2017 for financial compliance purposes is said to have described her as “financially supported by her husband”. The papers also revealed the couple owned a £30m townhouse overlooking London’s Regent Park and a £10m Oxfordshire country house. It also revealed the couple regularly chartered their own superyacht to sail around the south of France and the Caribbean. They also rented their own private jet, registered in the Isle of Man. The couple both have British citizenship. A spokesperson for the Chernukhins said Lubov’s donations were from her own money, and any suggestion to the contrary was false. The spokesperson said: “Mrs Chernukhin’s donations … have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence. All donations have been made and declared in accordance with Electoral Commission rules.” Mrs Chernukhin has condemned the “truly horrifying” invasion of Ukraine and has said Putin’s “despotic regime” has degraded to “Stalinist persecution” of the Russian people. The spokesperson said Mr Chernukhin was not a state employee while at the trade house of the Ministry of Foreign Trade or VEB, and was entitled to engage in private entrepreneurial activities. No authority in any jurisdiction has ever suggested or alleged wrongdoing on his part. The spokesperson said: “Mr Chernukhin served as deputy finance minister under Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov. Mr Chernukhin fled Russia … when it became known that Mr Kasyanov was forming organised opposition to President Putin.” Lawyers for the Chernukhins have previous said they consider documents in the Pandora papers were obtained unlawfully and dispute the accuracy of the reporting on them. A Conservative spokesperson said the party “only accepts donations from permissible sources, namely individuals registered on the UK’s electoral roll or UK-registered companies. Donations are properly … declared to the Electoral Commission, openly published by them and comply fully with the law.”",News/World news,Russian-born husband of Tory donor ‘earned millions via oligarch connections’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/russian-born-husband-of-tory-donor-earned-millions-via-oligarch-connections
3/27/2022,"Hundreds of boaters converged in west London’s Little Venice area on Saturday to protest about what they say is a “cull” of a traditional way of life along the capital’s waterways. The boat dwellers staged a demonstration about new moves by the Canal & River Trust (CRT), a charity which manages the waterways in England and Wales, to restrict mooring spaces in some parts of the capital and to issue enforcement notices against some who officials say are mooring their boats in the wrong areas. The CRT began issuing enforcement notices in January of this year. Waterways across England and Wales are becoming more popular, particularly in the capital. According to the CRT, “London’s canals are enjoying a second golden age with the number of boats almost doubling in the last decade.” Boat dwellers say that changes to the way waterways are managed to benefit those who are better off and discriminate against the boaters who may be living on low incomes. There are about 4,000 boats on London’s rivers and canals, half without permanent mooring. These boats are known as “continuous cruisers” and are expected to move from one mooring spot to another every 14 days. Many of these boaters remain within the same area of waterways where they have community links, their children attend schools and where they are close to their GP and other health services. Those living on boats do so because they like the lifestyle but also because boats can be a cheaper solution than bricks and mortar in London where affordable homes are in short supply. Amelia Friend and her partner Tyrone Halligan live on a boat in the Hackney area with their two-year-old son, Isaac. “The CRT is removing mooring spaces for boats like ours and that is massively changing our lives,” she said. “I’m pregnant and want to stay near the hospital where I’m due to give birth. I feel we are being pushed out of an area we have a right to be in. I love living in London and living on the canal allows us to be closer to nature.” Continuous cruisers pay the CRT an annual licence fee that varies from boat to boat, but can be as much as £1,000 a year. Boat dwellers are expected to travel at least 20 miles a year along the waterways. The boat protesters who converged on the capital on Saturday came from around the country and marched from London’s Regent’s Park to the CRT headquarters in Little Venice to raise objections to what they claim are discriminatory policies threatening the way of life of people who live and work along the waterways. They say there will be a reduction of about 300 mooring spaces under new “safety zone” rules and the introduction of some chargeable mooring spaces for short-term use. They are also objecting to a statement from the CRT that they will no longer accept complaints about their policies. The boaters say that while they accept that some stretches of water are unsafe for boats to moor due to narrowness of rivers at certain points or sharp bends, other areas where “no mooring” restrictions are being introduced are actually safe to moor. Some boaters have received enforcement notices in recent weeks stating that they cannot moor boats in these areas. Matthew Symonds, national boating manager for the CRT, said that the needs of a variety of different users of the waterways have to be carefully balanced – from commercial barges to rowing clubs, boat dwellers and those taking part in water sports such as kayaking. “We welcome everyone to use the waterways including live-aboard boaters and there remains ample mooring space, but we need to manage such a busy waterway safely for everyone,” he said. Ian McDowell, chair of the London branch of the National Bargee Travellers Association, which represents the boat dwellers, said: “This continued disregard for the people who live and work in these new ‘no mooring’ and proposed paid-for mooring areas drives boaters away from their livelihoods and out of their homes.” He added that the new moves by the CRT could restrict access to the capital’s waterways to those who can pay for it.",News/Environment,Hundreds of boaters join London protest against ‘cull’ of waterway life,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/hundreds-of-boaters-join-london-protest-against-cull-of-waterway-life
