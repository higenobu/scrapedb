5/16/2022,"The Coalition’s twin-pronged housing policy is likely to push up property prices to the benefit of existing homeowners, with only modest effects on increasing supply, market analysts say. Scott Morrison announced the plan on Sunday at the Coalition’s formal campaign launch, with first homebuyers to be allowed to access as much as $50,000 of their superannuation to help muster a mortgage deposit. To boost supply, the policy would also encourage more “empty-nesters” aged over 55 to downsize. Critics have amplified an admission to ABC’s RN Breakfast by the superannuation minister, Jane Hume, on Monday that allowing people to use their retirement nest eggs was likely to trigger “a bump in house prices”. Eliza Owen, the head of Australian research at the property data firm CoreLogic, said the super component of the plan would “add to demand, and this could increase the cost of housing”. “This may be good news for homeowners looking to protect their wealth, or sellers in an environment where housing market conditions are starting to soften, but for first homebuyers it could erode some of the benefit of dipping into their super,” Owen said. With construction costs rising sharply, it was also “a very challenging time to be incentivising more housing demand in the face of supply-side constraints”, she said. Past policies to aid first-time entrants to the property market tend to have only short-term effects, CoreLogic data showed. There were also equity issues to consider. @corelogicau has some interesting analysis on the Coalition's housing policy. One point is to note how first-home buyers have responded to previous temporary support packages. #auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/6qIymwkdPO In June 2020 the median superannuation balance was about $55,000, while for those between 25 and 34 years of age it was less than half that at $25,000, CoreLogic cited ABS data as saying. At a cap of 40%, the scheme would offer no more than $10,000 on a median level, or a similar amount of support as offered by some state grants.With a median property now fetching just under $750,000, the plan would help increase the size of a standard deposit only by about 1%, Owen said. “Unlike the first home loan deposit scheme, or Labor’s proposed shared equity scheme, there are no income caps associated with the Super Home Buyer Scheme, making it far more advantageous for young first homebuyers on higher incomes.” The independent economist Saul Eslake said the Coalition’s policy made him “want to scream”. “This reckless inflation of house prices must stop! But of course it won’t,” he said. Eslake said 60 years of “unambiguous and unequivocal evidence” showed that policies allowing Australians to pay more for housing than they otherwise could resulted in higher house prices rather than higher levels of home ownership. These included first homeowner grants, stamp duty concessions, mortgage deposit guarantee schemes, shared equity schemes, preferential tax treatment for property investors, lower interest rates and reductions in credit standards. “This scheme will be warmly welcomed by the 11 million or so voters who already own at least one residential property, and especially by the 2 million or so voters who own two or more properties,” he said, adding that a “much smaller number” of would-be first homebuyers with the capacity to take advantage of the plan would also support it. “But it will be greeted with despair, I suspect, by the majority of the typically 100,000 people a year who succeed in becoming first-time buyers, plus the – presumably larger – number who would like to but have been unable to become first-time buyers,” Eslake said. Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity, agreed the Coalition’s policy would “probably inflate prices”. “It’s like flicking a switch, where one point in time people suddenly have access to a large sum of money in order to go out there and buy their first home.” “So that could encourage a flood of buyers in the market who suddenly have an extra lot of money to spend,” Tindall said, adding that none of policies from the major parties addressed the root cause of the problem, “which is that property prices are too high”. The scheme had the benefit of requiring people to put the money back into super, plus any capital gains, assuming there are any. Still, the experience in New Zealand – with their non-compulsory retirement scheme – was that withdrawals got higher and higher as property prices rose, she said. Interesting chart on what's happened to New Zealanders' super accounts when they were permitted to use retirement accounts to get into housing. Once you get on this path, it seems to go just one way... #auspol #ausvotes #ausvotes2022 pic.twitter.com/mAkRZuOuxF The prime minister sought to counter criticism that adding demand to the property market would lift prices, saying it was “a balanced, responsible plan which we’ve thought through, which we think minimises any potential impact on house prices”. The balance included “freeing-up housing stock with our downsizing policy”, he said. The existing policy that allows people over 65 to sell up and tip as much as $600,000 of a property sale into their super accountswould be lowered to benefit those over 55 if the government were returned. In march THIS YEAR the Parliamentary Committee looking at housing affordability, Chaired by Liberal MP Jason Falinski found letting people withdraw super to buy a house would “likely increase demand and lead to higher property prices”…March. This year. Chaired by a Lib #auspol pic.twitter.com/jKe8kMA3js CoreLogic’s Owen said the current policy had registered just 22,000 sales between July 2018 and May 2021. Population data suggests the take-up was just 3.4% of eligible households. “Many older Australians may love the area where they live, but their area may not have adequate middle-to-high density housing for them to move in to,” Owen said. And “with kids living at home for longer, helping with grandchildren, some may actually find a larger family home still suits them well into their 50s and 60s”. Tindall, meanwhile, said the property market was anyway cooling off as interest rates rise, with “plenty more to come” from the Reserve Bank. “[There’s] somewhat of a correction across the property market in certain areas, which could give some first homebuyers breathing space,” she said.

5/16/2022,"The federal government has successfully blocked Bernard Collaery from obtaining key documents about the lawfulness of the notorious spy operation against Timor-Leste, arguing that questions about its legality are irrelevant. Collaery, a lawyer and one-time attorney general of the Australian Capital Territory, is awaiting trial on charges of conspiring to reveal classified information while working with his client, the former spy Witness K, in relation to a 2004 operation to bug the offices of Timor-Leste’s government during oil and gas negotiations. To aid his defence, Collaery attempted to subpoena documents from the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Office of National Intelligence, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which he hoped would show whether the mission was conducted unlawfully and outside of the proper functions of Asis. He argued he would be entitled to be acquitted if a jury had any reasonable doubt about the lawfulness of Asis’s activities, making the documents relevant to his case. But the commonwealth resisted the subpoenas, saying the material and questions about the legality of Asis’s mission – the existence of which it has steadfastly refused to confirm or deny – were irrelevant to the case. On Monday, Justice David Mossop agreed with the federal government and set aside Collaery’s subpoenas. He said the burden on the prosecution was only to prove that an offence had been committed by Collaery’s alleged disclosure of protected Asis information. That “does not extend to a requirement to prove compliance with every provision of the [Intelligence Services] Act relevant to the activity of Asis which gives rise to the information or matter disclosed”, Mossop said. Mossop cited the 1974 royal commission examining intelligence and security, which discussed Asis’s role and said that “in all cases, however, espionage is illegal and the clandestine service’s job is to break those laws without being caught”. He found the Intelligence Services Act could not be interpreted as allowing information about Asis and its activities to be revealed in cases where it had not complied entirely with its legal obligations. “Such an interpretation would render the provision ineffective and potentially compromise both Asis’s ability to obtain foreign intelligence and the safety of its personnel,” he said in a judgment summary. Collaery hoped the documents, among other things, would establish whether the then foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, had given notice of the operation to parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security, as required. The lawyer sought to argue that failing to give such notice meant his prosecution for disclosing information about the same intelligence operation could not succeed. Mossop said that cannot have been the intention of parliament when creating the nation’s intelligence laws. “That would mean that, by reason of a procedural error on the part of the minister, the details of the operation, details of Asis operational methods and capacities, the identity of its agents and the identity of persons overseas who cooperated with Asis might all be disclosed without fear of prosecution,” he wrote. “The same consequences would flow if there was non-compliance with any of the other provisions identified by the defendant.” “Those consequences may well be fatal for persons connected with the operation and would certainly be fatal to the capacity of Asis to obtain foreign intelligence.” The Collaery case has been bogged down in protracted battles over the extraordinary level of secrecy shrouding parts of the prosecution’s case from the public and Collaery himself. Collaery won a major victory last year in the ACT court of appeal which overturned secrecy orders covering parts of his trial. But the commonwealth is making a second attempt – using evidence that Collaery is not allowed to see – to convince the courts that parts of the trial pose a national security risk and must not be heard publicly. The extent of secrecy in the case is such that the ACT court of appeal’s initial judgment, handed down in October, still has not been published, because the commonwealth fears it contains information that will prejudice national security. Lawyers for the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, have gone to the high court to try to stop the full judgment from being published. A Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer, Kieran Pender, said the prosecution must cease. “Whoever wins the election this weekend must drop the prosecution of Bernard Collaery, and the two other whistleblowers currently on trial, Richard Boyle and David McBride,” he said. “Rather than dragging whistleblowers through the courts, in cases shrouded in secrecy, the new government should reform whistleblowing law to make it easier for Australians to safely and lawfully speak up about wrongdoing.”",News/Australia news,Government successfully blocks Bernard Collaery from obtaining documents on legality of spy mission,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/government-successfully-blocks-bernard-collaery-from-obtaining-documents-on-legality-of-spy-mission
5/16/2022,"Two years ago Coleen Rooney’s lawyers urged Rebekah Vardy to seek a mediated solution to her libel claim, warning that the “full public glare” of legal proceedings would not be an enjoyable experience. Instead, Vardy chose to take the case to trial and – after three days in the witness box being cross-examined on highly personal matters – told the high court she felt “bullied” and “manipulated” by the process. It’s not only the two footballers’ wives who have had their personal lives raked over as a result of the libel case – there has also been a litany of other people unwittingly dragged into the proceedings. Peter AndreIn 2004, a 22-year-old Vardy sold a kiss’n’tell story of a one-night-stand with Andre to the now defunct News of the World tabloid. Two decades later, Rooney’s lawyer read out the story in court as evidence that Vardy did not respect people’s privacy. In the process, Andre has had to deal with speculation about the size of his “chipolata” appendage reaching a new audience. Andre has said he has put up with being the “butt of all jokes” for more than 15 years and asked if people would laugh if the comments were about a woman. Danny DrinkwaterWhen the Premier League footballer was arrested for drink-driving after crashing his Range Rover in 2019, it was front page news. But the story had faded from memory – until court disclosures revealed Vardy had attempted to pass details of the car crash to a journalist at the Sun. Vardy said she wanted to leak the story because she abhorred drink drivers – but the court heard how Vardy messaged her agent with the information, and added: “I want paying for this x”. Riyad Mahrez and the 2017/18 Leicester City squadThe court heard allegations that Vardy discussed the Leicester City squad’s dislike of “on strike” player Mahrez with her agent. Rooney’s lawyers suggested Vardy gleaned the information about the state of the dressing room from her husband, the Leicester striker Jamie Vardy, and was then leaking it to the press. Vardy insisted she was just idly gossiping about how the players may feel and had “never discussed [with her husband] whether the lads were fuming”. The journalists discussed by Vardy and her agentThe proceedings have been uncomfortable for some journalists who weren’t even involved in the stories that prompted the libel case – but who have nonetheless found themselves mentioned in court. At one point the high court heard Vardy discussed with her agent whether to leak a story to Sky Sports reporter Rob Dorsett before concluding: “I just don’t want it coming back to me”. In another, Vardy’s agent praised Sun journalist Amy Brookbanks because she “always writes nice stories, does whatever I ask her and gets stories changed that she hasn’t even written”. Caroline WattVardy’s former agent and close friend is the ever-present but never-seen character in the Wagatha Christie trial. It was Watt’s phone that was dropped over the side of a boat in the North Sea soon after a legal request was made to search it – and it is Watt who Vardy now suggests was unilaterally leaking stories from Rooney’s Instagram page to the Sun. After allegedly being “thrown under a bus” at the last minute by Vardy – and amid reports she had urged Vardy to drop the legal proceedings before trial – Vardy said that Watt is too ill to give evidence in the case.",News/UK news,"Peter Andre, Danny Drinkwater and the unwitting collateral of ‘Wagatha Christie’",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/peter-andre-danny-drinkwater-and-the-unwitting-collateral-of-wagatha-christie
5/16/2022,"Some images never leave you: one that plays itself out in my mind is that of a teenage girl discovered in bed one morning curled up, bloody, with her baby, who is dead. She had given birth without assistance. Another: a woman – who did not know she was pregnant at the time – who gave birth to a stillborn baby in a toilet, having cried and cried for medical help. In both of these cases, which occurred in the last two years, the victims were in prison at the time they went into labour, and their babies died. Does that change how you see these women? It doesn’t for me. Regardless of her crime, this failing shows that prison is no place for a pregnant woman. It simply isn’t safe. One in 10 give birth in prison rather than a hospital, or on the way to the hospital. Women in prison are five times more likely to have a stillbirth and twice as likely to give birth to a premature baby that needs special care; 28% of the babies born to women serving a custodial sentence between 2015 and 2019 were admitted to a neonatal unit afterwards – double the national figure. I happen to live a stone’s throw from the former Holloway women’s prison. At our National Childbirth Trust class, the course leader, reflecting on years of work in the community, told us how keen most women are to leave hospital as soon as possible after giving birth, with the exception of the women from the prison, who wanted to stay as long as possible to delay returning to prison mother-and-baby units, where after 18 months their baby would be taken away from them. This continues to be the fate of women in prisons across the UK. Eleven countries including Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Portugal, have laws against the imprisonment of pregnant women, but not the UK, despite the fact that more than three in five women enter prisons for sentences of less than six months. The feminist organisation Level Up, along with the groups Women in Prison, No Births Behind Bars and others – including midwives, doctors and solicitors – are campaigning to change that. “Non-punitive responses to women who are traumatised and often in poverty and need support are what we should be striving for, rather than just exacerbating their existing trauma and poverty in prison, and then sometimes taking their children to care,” says Level Up campaigner Janey Starling. At present six out of 10 women in prison are survivors of domestic abuse. This campaign isn’t just about the risks of already traumatised women being forced to potentially endure the trauma of labour behind bars, it is also about prison being an unsafe place for any woman at any stage of pregnancy. Writing under a pseudonym in this newspaper, “Anna”, told of how she was too afraid to leave her cell in case a fight broke out and put her baby at risk, how the food was so unhealthy that it made her sick. She was handcuffed during labour, having waited hours to be taken to hospital. Guards refused to phone her mother or partner and watched her while she laboured. The doctor present was disgusted with her treatment. Other women have spoken of being denied extra food even when they are suffering morning sickness, and of being forced to miss scans or wait for them even when fearing miscarriage. The treatment of these women is inhumane. As for their babies, to be born into incarceration is a children’s rights issue. “We know that the first 24 months of a child’s life are the building blocks for their future and whatever they experience will impact their development, will impact their attachment with the mother,” says Starling. A “short sentence” for a woman is, she points out, a long sentence for her baby, and a lifetime in terms of trauma. In a reflection of its “tough on crime” stance, the government has been resistant to change its policy on the incarceration of pregnant women. Though the Ministry of Justice is keen to emphasise the rarity of cases such as the stillbirth mentioned above, there is a lack of transparency and data, both in terms of how many pregnant women are incarcerated and what their pregnancy outcomes – whether miscarriage or stillbirth – are. Attempts by Harriet Harman, chair of the joint committee on human rights, and others to amend the policing bill to ensure that judges take into account the best interests of children and unborn babies when sentencing, as well as requiring the government to gather and publish data, have been repeatedly rejected. “A young child’s separation from its mother when she’s sent to prison risks lifelong damage to that crucial relationship. Yet, too often, the child is invisible in the court process. This must change,” Harman has said. In solidarity with victims of this cruel system, women with their babies have been protesting against the incarceration of pregnant women, and will do so again on 7 June outside the Ministry of Justice with a mass feed-in (“spoons, boobs and bottles”). They plan to sit and feed their children until the justice minister, Dominic Raab, comes out to speak with them. They have also organised a petition, which can be found here. As a newborn over 30 years ago, I shared a postnatal ward with a baby who was born to a mother incarcerated at Holloway and supervised by prison guards. My own mother remembers it often. We have both long wondered what happened to that mum and that baby, all those years ago, and where they are now. How cruelly they must have been treated. And for what? What’s working: For a poetic perspective on parenthood, I recommend the work of Jack Underwood, whose collection A Year in the New Life and book Not Even This are essential reading for new parents grappling with global uncertainty, though never without a sense of humour. See his poem Fifteen Babies in My Garden: “We were just talking about the ruinous/and beautiful ways we’re going to break/your dumb old heart and totally fuck/your life up”. What’s not: I wrote previously of playing the Adagietto in Mahler’s Fifth to my baby in the womb. Now that the child is here, this piece has the pleasing result of sending him off to sleep almost instantly. Unfortunately, it is only 10 or so minutes long.

Tonight offers an excellent chance to see this pairing. The chart shows the view looking south from London at midnight as 16 May becomes 17 May. The moon will be full with 99% of its visible surface illuminated. It will be about 3.5 degrees away from Antares (for reference the full moon itself measures about 0.5 degrees across). Antares is the 15th brightest star visible in the sky and the brightest star in Scorpius. It slowly varies its brightness by a factor of about 0.75 but does not follow a regular cycle. This makes it a “slow irregular variable star”, a poorly understood class of variable star which can encompass a wide variety of causes. This week, the pairing is easily visible from the southern hemisphere too. In general, the farther south you go, the higher in the sky Scorpius appears, and so the easier it is to see.

5/16/2022,"The British Museum is filled with objects that were once sacred to one culture or another. Until recently, the move into a museum setting disenchanted such artefacts. Their new surroundings effectively deadened the mysterious spiritual power they had enjoyed when displayed in a shrine, be it a cult site, a sanctuary or a Christian church. But this is changing: I was startled when, visiting the London venue one afternoon, a group of visitors drifted past and paused briefly to genuflect and cross themselves before a stone statue of a Huastec goddess from Mexico. This divinity, ancient and obscure, still possessed spiritual meaning for them. Curators are newly sensitised to such visitors’ beliefs: claims for repatriation of ancestral items have prompted the recognition that their spiritual energy is intrinsic to their meaning. Exclusionary terms – “idolatry”, “unbeliever” – are now, thankfully, dead letters; the word “pagan” has new value, and respect is the guiding principle. Feminine Power: The Divine to the Demonic, a new show at the British Museum, gathers together an exhilarating array of goddesses, sorceresses and demonesses from living religions as varied as Tibetan Buddhism and Wicca, jostling side by side with cult objects from antiquity all over the globe. Belinda Crerar, the curator and author of the lucidly argued and richly illustrated catalogue, has also invited respondents – some of them adherents to a faith – to express their feelings about the female divinity in question. The curation signals from the start the difficult questions the material poses: a small, bulbous, squatting, steeple-headed clay sculpture from around 6000BC and two guitar-shaped Cycladic figurines, made about 3,000 years later, face a marble abstract female form, called Mother Earth and carved out of red-veined marble in 2010 by the Jordanian artist Mona Saudi (who sadly died in February). Mother goddesses? Evidence of matriarchy? Nobody knows, but the arguments in favour of such an interpretation are no longer upheld. The feminine here is not necessarily gendered female, though it manifests mostly in a female form, sometimes monstrous, sometimes zoomorphic. The show scrupulously sidesteps stereotypical categories such as Mother, Virgin, Whore. Instead, through five cellular spaces, it follows strands in which roles often overlap. In the first section, Creation & Nature, a video follows vodun-like ceremonies held in high summer in honour of Oshun, the Yoruba goddess of fresh water and healing. In the second, Love & Desire, the famous tablet of Ishtar-Inanna from the museum’s own collection shows the goddess full frontal, with eagle’s talons for feet, lions underfoot and a sentinel owl on each side. The power of this image is reawakened in the next section, Magic & Malice, where Kiki Smith’s bronze sculpture of Lilith hangs high on the wall. Lilith was the first wife of Adam and refused to lie down under him when making love, but flew away and was turned into a she-devil, abductor of children. Smith, born in 1954, has long revisited mythic figures who’ve been reviled, reclaiming them as patron saints and kindred spirits: Lot’s wife, Eve, Mary Magdalen. Her commanding vision of Lilith, with the bluest eyes (like the artist’s own), appears on the cover of the catalogue and presents the show’s leitmotiv: as with the celebrated publishing houses of the 1970s – Shameless Hussy in the US, Virago in the UK – appropriation of negative tropes has long been an effective feminist stratagem, but it used to be laced with more scepticism and irony. Feminine Power’s mood differs from the rebellious spirit of earlier times because the argument that religious systems oppress women is now strongly contested. The view is growing that the feminine imagery in religions attracts female devotees because it holds up a mirror to their/our lives and needs. Men’s interest in these manifestations of the feminine is not inquired into. By contrast, for my generation, religious views were considered to imprison women in low expectations and instil misogyny in men and women alike. I still waver over this because – while revelling in the enchantments of Circe, and riveted by the terrifying Aztec goddess Tlazolteotl, Eater of Filth – I am still troubled by the doctrine of the Fall and Eve’s role, and numerous aspects of different faiths’ attitudes to women; for example, by the sweet benign grace of Mary and her Buddhist counterpart Guanyin, goddess of Mercy, who both assign women in particular the duty of kindness and care. The function of images is far more complex, however, than simple mirroring and reinforcement. Motives – revenge against oppressors, a promise of reward in the hereafter, the need to feed divine powers in order to turn away their wrath – can only be touched on given the celebratory spirit of the exhibition. It would be a duller show and its narrative soapier if the negative stereotypes were all rehabilitated. The divine and demonic powers at issue would be weakened. This is not the case: in Justice & Defence, the terror of Kali beams out from the huge effigy of the goddess, which the museum commissioned from Indian artist Kaushik Ghosh. Made in the bright daylight of India, this ferocious and garish apparition, with her lolling scarlet tongue, the slick of blood on her raised sword, as well as the dumpy doll-like Shiva pinned down under her trampling feet, could appear histrionic and might arouse horrid laughter if it weren’t displayed next to a real weapon, an impressively long 19th-century iron “sword-axe” with the all-seeing eye of Kali, from whom no wrongdoer is safe, incised on its surface. The goddess symbolises, we are told, evil being cut away, hypocrisy undone, abusive powers crushed. (I rather hoped the necklace of severed male heads she wears might be portraits of well-known oppressors, but no, they mostly look like Salvador Dalí.) The closing section, Compassion & Salvation, turns to Mary and her Quranic counterpart, Maryam, as well as to the Buddhist goddess of Mercy, Guanyin, who began as a male bodhisattva (an enlightened being). This section exemplifies therefore potentially non-binary strands in the conception of feminine power. Some of the most exquisite art appears here: a wonderful miniature of talismanic calligraphy gives the full Surah Maryam, the Quranic story of the birth of Jesus; an image of the Madonna of Guadalupe – enveloped in a radiant scarlet aureole and green mantle – is made, if you look closely, entirely in minute straws laid side by side. Meanwhile, an 18th-century Chinese statuette of Guanyin on a lotus holds a symbol of blessing in each of her 18 arms, every tiny graceful finger miraculously modelled in lucent porcelain. These beautiful images made my anxious, ingrained resistance to goddess worship falter. I then yielded – to pure delight. In some cases, a finer object could have been chosen to illustrate the point: John William Waterhouse’s maidenly Circe only feebly conveys that founding sorceress’s magic. Nor does the terracotta Medusa carry the full force of the gorgon’s magnificent fury. But overall, Feminine Power spreads a feast of objects both precious and popular, ancient and new: it has something of the character of a cabinet of curiosities. Walking through the curving spaces (the layout reminded me of Skara Brae, thought to be shaped like the interior of a woman’s body), I found my senses rewired and sparking at the sheer variety of materials on show, the contrasts of medium, texture, scale and luminosity: the rich gleaming chestnut-red Ohia wood carved and buffed by a contemporary Māori sculptor, Tom Pico, for his image of a crouching flower goddess; the waxy dark soapstone of a bulbous mermaid-like deity Sedna, mistress of the sea, by an Inuit artist, Lincassie Kenuajuak; and the cornelian Ankh-shaped amulet from 1400BC that symbolises the blood of Isis (her menstrual blood, Belinda Crerar told me), which was placed on the neck or chest of the dead to protect them. When it comes to forms of expression in order to invoke the powers above and below, human ingenuity, it seems, knows no bounds. Feminine Power belongs in a splendid line of British Museum explorations of the sacred, with Grayson Perry’s The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman in 2011 an outstanding example. This series exemplifies the fundamental shift in the concept of museums and their relation to their publics: the visit becomes an ecumenical ritual, the museum a site where differing systems meet in peace (it is to be hoped) and a form of modern syncretism develops, with contemporary Wiccan devotees of Artemis coexisting with followers of Kali. Surprisingly, this echoes the approach of the Roman empire to religious variety: Romans were unexpectedly welcoming to new gods (Cybele, Mithras) and, as is notorious, deified their emperors even during their lifetime. The landscape of faith today, as this exhibition reveals, reflects this same push towards all-embracing ecumenism. The final note is struck by one of Wangechi Mutu’s “sentinel” or “guardian” series: called Grow the Tea, Then Break the Cups, she’s a Giacometti-like female bust made of dark soil, charcoal, oyster shells, feathers, hide, china and hair. It’s an alarming, secret-looking, numinous piece, and an example of the artist’s call to each of us to create our own divinities. Some of this new approach may conform, surprisingly, to western ideals of individual empowerment rather than the collective strength offered by a shared faith. It may also contain a dose of wishful thinking, as Feminine Power overlooks inherently troubling aspects in the interest of civility and inclusiveness. But the overall impetus, to reconnect us to the volcanic energy of goddess cults the world over, has inspired a treasure store of fascinating artefacts, thoughtfully chosen and arranged.

After two years of postponements, curtailments and cancellations, hopes are high that the summer of 2022 will be a fun and abundant one for festival-goers. Ahead of that, the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) has updated a charter of best practice that it first launched in 2017. A total of 103 festivals have committed to the relaunched charter, also including the National Eisteddfod of Wales, Boardmasters on the Cornish coast and Shambala on a “secret country estate” in Northamptonshire. One of the key promises is that “all allegations of sexual harassment, assault and violence will be taken seriously, acted upon promptly and investigated”. The Safer Spaces charter has been updated with guidance and input from organisations including Rape Crisis England and Wales. Its communications officer, Kelly Bennaton, said it was encouraging to see the commitment of festival organisers. “Festival-goers deserve to know that if they report sexual assault they will be listened to and believed, and that those working on site are equipped to handle all reports with knowledge and empathy. “They also deserve to know that festivals are taking a proactive approach in preventing sexual assault, and that abusive behaviour will not be tolerated.” Bennaton said she hoped the wider festival industry would follow the lead of the AIF. According to Rape Crisis England and Wales, one in five women have been raped or sexually assaulted as an adult with the highest ever number of rapes recorded in 2021. The scale of the crisis is bigger because five in six women who are raped do not report it to police. The charter also cites a YouGov poll from 2018 which reported that one in five festival-goers had experienced sexual assault or harassment at a UK festival. The campaign will highlight the five “D’s” of bystander intervention – direct, delegate, distract, document and delay. Phoebe Rodwell, the AIF’s membership and operations coordinator, said understanding about how to tackle sexual violence was evolving all the time. “That’s why it’s important that we renew the Safer Spaces campaign in 2022 with up-to-date messaging, resources and practices, to prevent sexual violence and promote a survivor-led approach, helping festival organisers to fulfil their duty of care at events.”",Arts/Culture,More than 100 UK festivals sign up to tackle sexual violence,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/16/more-than-100-uk-festivals-sign-up-to-tackle-sexual-violence
5/16/2022,"Wayne Rooney will this week give evidence in his wife’s “Wagatha Christie” libel trial, as the multimillion-pound case at the centre of a media circus enters its final days at the high court in London. England’s record goalscorer has sat in court next to his wife, Coleen Rooney, throughout but until now has remained stoically silent and impassively staring into space. The football manager did not react as he listened to his wife tell the court about difficulties in their marriage or the impact that tabloid intrusion had had on their personal lives over the last 20 years. Rooney has been called as a witness for his wife’s defence and is likely to be asked about an alleged exchange with his then England teammate, Jamie Vardy, about Rebekah Vardy’s dealings with the media. Coleen Rooney’s witness statement claims that when her husband was captain of the England football team at Euro 2016, he warned Jamie that his wife’s decision to write a column for the Sun during the tournament “was causing a distraction to the touring party”. Rebekah Vardy denies this was the case. Coleen has previously said that Wayne was completely unaware she was conducting a supposed sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to the Sun. In 2019 she publicly alleged the source of the leaks was Rebekah Vardy’s Instagram account, prompting Vardy to sue for libel. While Jamie Vardy has stayed away from the court – instead training and scoring goals for Leicester City – Wayne Rooney has been ever-present at his wife’s side, sitting on the front row of the courtroom and helping to carry designer bags into court. During one break in proceedings, he stood outside the courtroom cheerily chatting with a man in a Liverpool FC shirt attending a different trial, while at another he held the door open for lawyers and journalists as they left court. The Derby County manager has also had to deal with jibes about his financially stricken football club. At one point Hugh Tomlinson QC, Vardy’s barrister, asked Coleen Rooney whether she had any hard evidence that Vardy was the leaker – rather than simply a strong belief. He posed the question: “You might believe Derby County might win the Premiership in two years’ time. It’s not evidence is it?” Rooney did not flinch at all when he heard the comment. It would be impossible for Derby County to win the top division of English football within two years because they have just been relegated to the third tier. The trial will resume on Monday morning with Coleen Rooney continuing to be cross-examined. Under English libel law it is up to Rooney to prove her original accusation that Vardy was the individual leaking stories about her family to the Sun. By Rooney’s own admission her case against Vardy is based on circumstantial evidence. Vardy’s team insist the reason there is no smoking gun is because Vardy was not involved in leaking the stories in question. Rooney’s lawyers have argued that the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming and key material that could prove their client’s case has been deliberately destroyed or mislaid. While Vardy only called one witness – herself – Rooney’s defence team have called a number of PR advisers, agents and former Football Association staff to give evidence. The trial is scheduled to finish on Wednesday after seven days of public court hearings. There is no jury in the case and high court judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, who has been overseeing proceedings, will then hand down a judgment at a later date. The trial continues.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’ trial: Wayne Rooney to give evidence in libel case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/wagatha-christie-trial-wayne-rooney-to-give-evidence-in-libel-case
5/16/2022,"Here is everything you need to know about the voting process in the 2022 Australia election. The 2022 Australian federal election day is Saturday, 21 May. The Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that runs elections, says there are 17 million people enrolled to vote in the 2022 federal election – 96.3% of the eligible voting population. The deadline for enrolment was Monday 18 April. If you are not sure of the status of your enrolment, you can check here. You can also call the AEC on 13 23 26. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). You can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you need to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may well be tight. According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022 voters’ guide: everything you need to know ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/australian-election-2022-voters-guide-how-to-vote-when-who-everything-you-need-to-know-australia-federal-poll-day
5/16/2022,"The Coalition, Labor and the Greens (plus the wave of independents) are getting most of the headlines in this election. But your ballot papers will also be full of candidates representing parties you might not know much – or anything – about. From the big-spender ads of the United Australia party and the re-election desires of One Nation, to a bunch of micro-parties representing niche interests, Australia’s democracy and elections are a rich tapestry – and it takes all types to make a campaign. Here’s a quick rundown of these lesser-known parties running Senate candidates in the 2022 Australian federal election on 21 May, and what they stand for. With representatives in NSW and Victoria’s state parliaments, the party says it wants “to give a political voice to animals”, including promoting animal protection and “animal-friendly policies”. They campaign for increased penalties for animal abuse, animal trade, and supporting sustainable and ethical practices. Running in: the Senate in all states besides Northern Territory, as well as lower house seats in most states. Led by the former special forces soldier Heston Russell, the party says it aims to “bring balance into the Centre” of politics. AVP wants to create an American-style National Guard to assist in emergencies, better support for defence veterans, a review into ABC funding, “greater certification requirements for media organisations and journalists to be permitted their special exemptions under legal legislation”, and “greater consequences” for “negligent” media reporting. Running in: the Senate in Queensland, NSW, WA and Victoria, and several lower house seats in Victoria and Queensland. The party wants to elect “a Christian voice amidst the voices in Parliament”. It wants to see marriage as only between a man and woman, “zero tolerance” to drugs, and suggests an inquiry into increasing the legal drinking age to 21. It also says the settled scientific view that carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change needs “further scrutiny”, opposes euthanasia, and wants to restrict IVF to married couples. Running in: the Senate, as well as nine lower house seats, in WA only. Saying they were “inspired by the policies of old Labor”, the party wants to start a public bank at post offices, repeal the prohibition on nuclear power, wants a “dramatic” increase to health resourcing and a moratorium on house and farm foreclosures. Running in: the Senate in Queensland, Victoria, SA, WA and NSW. Once a major player in the Senate, the party’s presence has faded significantly since it was formed by the former Liberal politician Don Chipp. In the small-l liberal tradition, it pursues broadly centrist economic policies, social liberalism and puts an emphasis on political accountability. Running in: the Senate in SA, NSW, Victoria, WA and QLD. Named after its leader, the former journalist, the Justice Party is calling for reforms to bail, parole, family courts and domestic violence law, campaigning for sentencing to “reflect community views” and “more jail, less bail”. Running in: the Senate and several lower house seats in Victoria Named for the anti-Communist party activist, the party wants to “stand up to China”, support Hong Kong, Uyghur and Tibetan communities and repeal Australia’s free trade agreement with China. The party also is calling for welfare rates to be raised above the poverty line, and wants to boost renewables and put dental health into Medicare. Running in: NSW, SA and Queensland. The name pretty much sums it up. As the party says, it is “a single-issue party and that issue is anti-corruption”. It wants a national Icac, to limit donations to political parties, real-time disclosure of donations, and to restrict politicians from being appointed to government positions or commercial businesses connected to their former portfolios. Running in: the Senate in NSW, Queensland and WA. The party backs Christian values, opposes late-term abortions and the teaching of “gender fluidity” in schools, and wants to consider “corporal punishment models” to penalise rape and other serious crimes. Running in: the Senate and lower house seats in Victoria, WA, SA, Queensland and NSW. A “fusion” of the Science, Pirate, Secular, Vote Planet and Climate Change Justice parties. Its policies include a 10-year transition to negative emissions, a carbon price, 800% renewables, high speed rail, and a $500 weekly universal basic income. Running in: NSW, Queensland, SA, Victoria and WA in the House and Senate Led by the controversial former One Nation senator Rod Culleton. GAP backs “mandatory” jail for violent crimes and boot camps for juvenile offenders, would relax firearm laws, has policies for a “concealed carry licence”, and would abolish income tax and remove compulsory superannuation. Running in: the lower house and Senate in WA, Queensland, NSW, Victoria, SA, NT. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The party is calling for the protection of rivers and better water management, an end to detention for Indigenous children and ending adult incarceration “except for the most serious offences”, and replacing fines with community service. Running in: NSW and Queensland. Imop campaigns for people’s right to refuse or choose medical products and procedures like Covid vaccines, including advocating the removal of No Jab No Play and vaccine mandates. It also wants to remove fluoride from drinking water, promote alternative therapies, legalise medical cannabis nationwide and pause the rollout of 5G technology. Running in: ACT, NSW, Queensland, SA, Tasmania, Victoria and WA. The Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie wants to get more supporters in parliament. She wants to lower donation caps and introduce real-time disclosure, boost local manufacturing and start an inquiry into Chinese foreign interference. Running in: Tasmania Bob Katter’s organisation wants to lower power prices, relax firearms and crocodile culling laws, have an opt-out scheme for organ donation, increase access to vaping products and boost north Queensland infrastructure such as roads and rail. Running in: Queensland With some financial support from Climate 200, law academic Kim Rubenstein is campaigning on climate, integrity and a federal Icac, women’s safety and a First Nations voice to parliament. Running in: you guessed it, the ACT Unsurprisingly, the party wants to legalise, tax and regulate weed. It wants a moratorium on arresting users and to expunge historical sentences for personal use, as well as to allow people to grow cannabis at home. Running in: all states and territories. Still running under their original name (despite a high court challenge), the libertarian party’s run is being headlined by the former Liberals Campbell Newman and John Ruddick. Calling for smaller government and low taxes, the Liberal Democrats want to institute American-style “recall elections”, wind back Covid and mask rules, immediately cut all government departments and politicians’ pay by 10%, and a flat tax of 20% for all. Running in: all states and territories. Focusing on candidates who are “independent local leaders who are already contributing to their neighbourhoods”, this party has a larger focus on Tasmania-specific issues such as salmon farming, the state’s energy mix, and further restrictions on poker machines. It also advocates for “citizens’ juries”, or the process of deliberative democracy, to decide contentious issues. Running in: Tasmania and SA. Formerly known as the New Liberals, TNL advocates for net zero emissions by 2030, a retrospective federal Icac, a legislated charter of rights, boosting foreign aid, new lyrics for the national anthem, restricting mass political advertising, real-time political donation disclosure, and restricting politicians to serving only 12 years in parliament. Running in: Queensland, NSW, Victoria and SA. Looking to hold Pauline Hanson’s Senate seat in Queensland, One Nation wants to remove Australia from the United Nations Refugee Convention and Paris climate agreement, boost government subsidies to apprentices, block sale of property to non-citizens, and place further restrictions on abortion. Running in: all states and territories. The fledgling party says it aims to end poverty, homelessness and the climate emergency, and dismantle corruption. It wants an emissions trading scheme and a federal Icac. Running in: Victoria, ACT, Queensland, SA A centrist party, Reason seeks to decriminalise all drugs and legalise cannabis, promotes comprehensive sex education in schools and supports more progressive policies on Indigenous Australians, women, the LGBTIQ community and immigration. Running in: Victoria, NSW, Queensland. Led by the sitting senator and former Centre Alliance member, Patrick is campaigning on greater transparency and accountability in government and addressing foreign interference. He also has numerous South Australia-specific policies such as boosting manufacturing jobs and the submarine industry, as well as protecting the Murray-Darling. Running in: SA They want greater scrutiny on foreign land purchases, the expansion of the live export trade, reduced restrictions on “law-abiding firearms owners”, to implement a bill of rights and to expand private game reserves and hunting areas. Running in: NSW Pushing for policies to benefit retirees and pensioners, the party wants reforms for dementia and palliative care, simpler rules around aged care and a public TV channel for seniors. They also want more staff and money for aged care, expansion of the veteran’s “gold card” and more support for army veterans. Running in: NSW and WA Promoting “revolutionary change”, the party is campaigning for equality and against gas mining. They want to repeal the GST and the stage 3 tax cuts, raise company tax and a new “wealth” tax, nationalise mines and banks, go to 100% renewables within 10 years, more progressive policies on refugees and asylum seekers, and to abolish Asio and other spy agencies. Running in: NSW, Queensland, Victoria and WA The party is campaigning to stop overdevelopment and corruption and to protect the environment. SAP wants free university for all, a ban on all new coal mines and fracking, a ban on further foreign ownership, a national job guarantee program for full employment and a universal age pension. Running in: all states and territories. Clive Palmer’s pet project is blanketing the country with ads about low interest rates, abolishing Hecs debts and ending a range of anti-Covid measures such as masks and vaccine mandates. United Australia Party (UAP) also want to increase the age pension, enact more generous rules for mining and freeze fuel excises. Running in: all states and territories Running on a similar “revolutionary” platform to the national Socialist Alliance – including scrapping the GST and increasing taxation on the rich and corporations, lifting welfare payments to at least $1,500 a fortnight and nationalising the banks – the party also calls for governments to pursue a long-term Covid elimination strategy. Running in: Victoria A “centre-based” party, it spruiks policies focused on WA, including basing more federal government workers and public spending in the state. It also wants to abolish political donations from property developers, reform stamp duty and property taxes, and direct more mining royalties to regional WA.

5/16/2022,"While most other crofters are minding their fields for lambs, we are watching the water. Loch Eil reflects the soft grey clouds rolling down the corries, but closer inspection reveals milky drifts below its surface. The mussels are spawning. Mytilus edulis release sperm and eggs into the water, making a swimming soup of fertilisation that births billions of mussel larvae. These infinitesimal shellfish float freely with the current and tide. Crofters have long gathered shellfish; what was once survival is now known as diversification. And today, before the first cuckoo has called, my partner and his brother are loading the workboat with bags of rope, preparing to catch this year’s first mussel spat. The engine rumbles to life, spooking a heron into flight. The boat motors away towards the longlines, mist rising all around. Gulls perched on each grey float regard its approach with indifference; an otter slips into the loch, leaving behind empty crab shells. The two men will tie 15,000 metres of weighted and textured rope on to a 220-metre pair of headropes. Once the juvenile mussels attach their byssal threads to the rope, they might be the size of a grain of sand. By October, their length could be anything from rice kernel to thumbnail. Reproductive maturity is a few months away then; these young mussels should contribute to the spat for two more springs before they are ready for harvest. That harvesting can happen throughout the year, but spat collection is on nature’s timetable. And spawning patterns are becoming less predictable in some parts of the world. Seawater temperatures and rising CO2 levels are factors in a successful spat collection, just as much as nutrients, tidal range, currents and salinity; rope structure and size, its depth in the water. Sustainable farming can mean constant adjustments to work with the mussels’ own ecosystem. The mussel population in this loch thrives in the top four to five metres, where there is less predation from sea urchins and starfish. And greater light levels near the surface means there’s also more food. Lean over the side of the boat and at first all you see is yourself and a silver sky. But follow the ropes. Sunlight reaches down to the end of each dropper, revealing filaments and fibres wafting in the depth. That sunlight feeds phytoplankton, which feed mussels, which will, eventually, feed us.

5/16/2022,"Omar Abu al-Ouf is revising for his final school exams, hoping to do well enough to pursue his dream of becoming an engineer, but it’s difficult for the 17-year-old to focus. His mind constantly drifts to his family, all of whom died last year when an Israeli airstrike destroyed their apartment building in a middle-class neighbourhood of Gaza city. “It’s like he goes somewhere else,” said his grandmother, Manar, in the living room of the boy’s uncle’s house, where he now lives. “His whole family is gone, for nothing.” Ouf spent 12 hours under the collapsed building, his arm around the body of his 12-year-old sister, Tala. His brother Tawfik, 17, remained alive for several hours; they talked to each other in the darkness, choking on rubble dust. Tawfik told him that their mother, Reem, was dead; before rescue teams could reach them, Tawfik too died from his injuries. Their father, Ayman, an internal medicine specialist at Gaza’s main hospital, was also killed in the attack. The 11-day conflict last May between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that controls the Gaza Strip, left Ouf totally alone. A year on, the teenager still suffers from nerve problems in his right arm and leg. He is trying to rebuild his life, he said, but still can’t make sense of what happened. “Ramadan and Eid this year were very hard. I miss them every day. I didn’t think my life would be like this,” he said. “I don’t go out much. Sometimes my friends come see me here, but we have all got to study now. The only hobby I have since the incident is crying.” Ouf is now living with his uncle’s family, not far from his old home on al-Wehda Street, a busy thoroughfare filled with apartment blocks, shops and cafes where 44 people were killed in the Israeli strike on 16 May last year. The attack was the single deadliest incident in the conflict, which left 256 Palestinians in Gaza and 14 people in Israel dead. The Israel Defence Forces said the civilian deaths on Wedha Street were “unintended”, caused by the collapse of the underground foundations of a targeted Hamas military structure which brought down the housing blocks on the street above. Rights groups such as Amnesty International have said that the incident may constitute a war crime. A year later, just 5% of the 1,000 housing units, roads and other infrastructure destroyed by the bombardment of the Gaza Strip have been rebuilt, according to the Hamas housing ministry. Much UN and other funding from external donors is often held up in lengthy diplomatic talks or impeded by the Israeli and Egyptian authorities, which have blockaded the area since the Islamist group seized control in 2007. The de facto siege has led to a collapsed healthcare system, poisoned Gaza’s water, and leaves the small area’s two million inhabitants struggling to cope with rolling power cuts. The rubble from the last round of fighting may have been cleared, but gaping holes and sandy lots strewn with rubbish remain, a daily reminder of the lives and homes lost. On a poster hanging opposite Ouf’s destroyed home, the faces of three children killed in the last round of hostilities, in 2014, also peer down on passers-by. Tensions between Hamas and Israel are on the rise again. The militant group’s leaders have praised a recent spate of terrorist attacks targeting Israelis that have left 19 people dead, and urged Palestinian citizens of Israel and those living in the occupied West Bank to carry out more attacks. Hamas has also threatened another all-out war if recent clashes at Jerusalem’s Aqsa mosque compound continue. In response, Israeli officials have reportedly relayed a warning to Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’ top leader inside Gaza, that his latest speeches inciting terrorism give Israel the freedom to respond militarily. Israel closed the only frontier crossing to most of the 12,000 Palestinians in Gaza with permission to work outside for two weeks, and Israeli media have reported that the government is considering restricting their numbers in future. The loss of income has added to the daily misery in a place where a whole generation has now grown up trapped in the overcrowded, polluted coastal enclave: unemployment in Gaza is running at about 50%, and workers commuting to Israel are worried that they will no longer be able to bring home $1.5m in collective earnings each day. Ouf, who has already lost everything, says he doesn’t care if there is another war. He hopes to leave Gaza one day – maybe to study abroad – but the future is too overwhelming to think about. “It’s hard to express all the things I feel,” he said. “I was going to work hard, celebrate my exam results, go to university … I wanted to make my father proud of me. But instead, I am alone.”",News/World news,‘I miss them every day’: the boy who lost his whole family to an Israeli airstrike,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/i-miss-them-every-day-the-boy-who-lost-his-whole-family-to-an-israeli-airstrike
