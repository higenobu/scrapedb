4/4/2022,"Environmental activists have blocked a major oil terminal near Heathrow airport, as protesters’ blockades of fuel distribution facilities around England enter a fourth day. About 30 members of Extinction Rebellion (XR) arrived at the Esso West facility in west London at about 4am, where they erected two bamboo lock-on structures, XR said. According to the environmental protest group’s statement, once they had blocked the entrance, the group unfurled two large banners that said: “Join Us – London 9th April” and “Stop Fossil Fuels Now”. Andrew Smith, from Extinction Rebellion, said: “We’re here to say that climate action cannot wait. Right now, governments are choosing to exploit the crisis in Ukraine to hand out oil licences and continue the fossil fuel economy that’s destroying us. “They are exploiting public fear and disorientation at a time of crisis when people’s bills are going up to advance corporate-friendly policies incapable of attracting democratic support.” It is the fourth time since Friday that XR has blockaded the same oil terminal, while other environmental protesters struck at nine other oil terminals over the weekend as part of a campaign to disrupt the UK’s fuel distribution infrastructure which activists have dubbed “Just Stop Oil”. Just Stop Oil has vowed to continue their “civil resistance” protests until the government agrees a moratorium on all new fossil fuel projects and claims it has more than 1,000 supporters willing to be arrested for taking part. On Friday, supporters of the campaign blocked 10 refineries around the country, including three in the Midlands, three in Essex, two in Hampshire, one in London and one in Hemel Hempstead. On Saturday, they blocked seven terminals and a major lorry park housing oil tankers. And on Sunday, they blocked at least five oil refineries, plus the Thames Oil Port. More than 80 people were arrested in Essex over the weekend, while 14 were held in Staines in Surrey, and six were arrested in Birmingham, according to PA Media. Just Stop Oil said they had recorded more than 290 arrests among supporters taking part in actions. In Essex, activists dug tunnels beneath the roads leading to the Inter Terminals and Navigator oil terminals. Traffic in and out of the site had been stopped over the weekend but resumed on Monday, with police escorting tankers out of the sites on the roads over the tunnels, a spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said. More actions were planned on Monday, Just Stop Oil said. There were anecdotal reports of fuel running out in petrol stations, with local papers in Kent and Northampton, in the east Midlands, reporting claims on social media that petrol pumps were running dry. A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s, the UK’s biggest petrol retailer, insisted the company was “not seeing any issues”, but said they were monitoring the situation closely. However, a source at a top five fuel retailer said it was possible that protests would begin to have an impact if they continued. “None of our stations ran out of fuel at the weekend, we just had to divert some from terminals further north,” the source said. “That’s not to say [the protests] will not have an impact if they go on.” The effect of the protests on retailers supply chains had been dampened by a quiet weekend, the source said. “If it had happened on Mother’s Day it might have been a bit more difficult,” he added. XR’s disruption at Shell and elsewhere has come ahead of another campaign of protest in London from Saturday. The group says the planned “mass rebellion in London” will include “tactically smart, highly disruptive mass participation action” which will “create the most roadblocks we ever have”. XR said in a statement: “Extinction Rebellion is calling on everyone watching the current protests to join them at Hyde Park on [Sunday] at 10am to finally bring an end to fossil fuels. We will return to the streets day after day until our immediate demand – for the UK government to immediately end all new fossil fuel investments – is met.”",News/Environment,Protesters block oil depot near Heathrow as action enters fourth day,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/04/protesters-block-oil-depot-near-heathrow-as-action-enters-fourth-day
4/4/2022,"François-Xavier Roth conducted the latest concert in the London Symphony Orchestra’s Futures series. With the ballast in his programme provided by accounts of two of Richard Strauss’s symphonic poems – a racy performance of Till Eulenspiegel and an edgy, almost histrionic one of Death and Transfiguration, both delivered with full-spectrum brilliance by the LSO - there were three premieres, two of them from composers who had previously been part of the orchestra’s Panufnik scheme for encouraging young talent. Finnish composer Joel Järventausta was a member of the scheme just three years ago. His Sunfall, inspired by a vivid 19th-century painting of a sunset, and by Cormac McCarthy’s novel Blood Meridian, seemed an exceptionally assured piece of orchestral writing. It’s a fiercely concentrated, 10-minute tone poem, in which violent outbursts of brass alternate with more consoling instrumental lines, and uneasy passages of stasis. Francisco Coll is a Panufnik alumnus from the scheme’s early days. The British premiere of his 2019 violin concerto, co-commissioned by the LSO, had been delayed by Covid. Written for Patricia Kopatchinskaja and already available on disc, it seemed as brilliantly original played live by her as it does on record. In outline it’s very much a three-movement concerto in the virtuoso tradition, complete with cadenza and perfectly tailored to Kopatchinskaja’s extravagant talents, but it’s also a showcase for Coll’s own freewheeling orchestral virtuosity, his tangled, teeming invention, ear for vivid sonorities, and sly references to earlier music. The third new work was also an LSO commission. But even with Håken Hardenberger as the typically assured soloist, Helen Grime’s trumpet concerto Night-Sky-Blue, was disappointingly limited in its solo writing, which seemed to fixate on just a couple of ideas. The orchestral writing was far more imaginative and the ear was often drawn away from the solo trumpet to what was going on elsewhere – not exactly ideal in a concerto.",Arts/Music,"LSO/Roth review – vivid, violent and virtuosic premieres ",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/lso-roth-kopatchinskaja-hardenberger-coll-grime-jarventausta

4/4/2022,"Ted Baker has kicked off a formal sale process for the fashion brand after rejecting a series of bids from the US private equity group Sycamore Partners and others. The company said it had received more than one unsolicited offer from third parties in addition to three bids from Sycamore, a group that previously owned the British shoe shop chains Kurt Geiger and Nine West and has recently been linked to a potential bid for the health and beauty chain Boots. Ted Baker, which has more than 500 shops and concessions around the world, said that as a result of the expressions of interest it had “decided to conduct an orderly process to establish whether there is a bidder prepared to offer a value that the board considers attractive relative to the standalone prospects of Ted Baker as a listed company”. Interested parties are being invited to submit indicative offers to Ted Baker’s advisers Evercore and Blackdown Partners. A number of bids will then be selected to participate in a second phase. Sycamore, whose first approach emerged on 18 March, has a deadline of 15 April to decide if it will participate in the formal sales process for Ted Baker, put forward a formal offer or walk away. If it decides to take part in the new sales process that deadline will lapse. The sale process comes as Ted Baker’s share price remains in the doldrums after collapsing in 2018 amid difficult trading conditions for clothing brands, a scandal about a culture of “forced hugs” under its founder, Ray Kelvin, which led to his exit from the company. The company was then hit by the emergence of an accounting error and a string of profit warnings. Ted Baker is attempting a turnaround under its new boss, Rachel Osborne, who took over in 2020, after its core market for suits and outfits for social events took a hit during the Covid-19 pandemic. The bidders have approached amid early signs of a turnaround, with losses narrowing more than 70% to £25m in the six months to 14 August last year as sales bounced back nearly 18% to £199m. But the company is currently without a chair after the death of the incumbent, John Barton, in December. Shares in Ted Baker have risen by 48% since 17 March, the day before Sycamore first revealed its plans for a bid, but remain more than 90% below March 2018 levels.",News/Business,Ted Baker puts itself up for sale after third US private equity bid,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/ted-baker-up-for-sale-us-private-equity-bid-sycamore-offers
4/4/2022,"Iwas 21 years old when my mother died in 2011. While this was sad, what was even more shattering was how my 75-year-old father aged overnight. Being alone made him fall into a deep depression. He needed to be around people constantly, loneliness was his nemesis, and there was no easy antidote. On his own, he would not always eat enough, or drink enough, and he was at risk of falling over. On the verge of adulthood, I had no idea what to do regarding my father’s care. I had gone from studying Noam Chomsky at university to studying care facilities. At first, we tried an assisted living facility, which offered round-the-clock care while retaining a degree of independence. However, the loneliness was all too consuming. He neglected himself, and it soon became apparent that this was not the right place for him. I eventually decided that a nursing home was the safest place for my father. I struggled with feelings of shame and inadequacy. My greatest fear was that it would take away my father’s dignity and autonomy, and that he would become institutionalised. I feared he would lose his joie de vivre and become a zombie, utterly dependent on the nursing home. Luckily, and to my surprise, the nursing home was better than I could have imagined. It gave him company, warmth and copious amounts of tea. He needed this caring environment like a child needs their parents. It was no substitute for his wife’s love and care, but it was like a safety blanket. He had worked so hard his entire life; this was his time to be looked after properly.In the nursing home, my father came alive again and went back to his jovial, intellectually curious self. Every time I visited him, he walked around with his walking stick or frame, in high spirits. My father could entertain his greatest love, reading, at the nursing home. I would buy him books on history, politics and his beloved Scotland. He read voraciously, sometimes a book a day. While his body grew less and less mobile, his mind stayed sharp. We would talk for hours about his childhood in wartime Glasgow. His mind was taking him back to the beginning of his life, his body towards the end. But five years into his stay, in 2016, we made a catastrophic mistake. I was suffering from a mental illness – later diagnosed as bipolar disorder – and my father thought it would be a good idea for us to live together once again. He wanted to take care of me. Suddenly going from a catatonic state to caring for my elderly father, who had significant health needs, was disastrous for us both. We moved into a small house together. My father suddenly had to fend for himself again, having been stable in a nursing home. I dragged myself out of bed so I could clean the house and cook for him, but secretly I was barely surviving the depths of depression. I developed psychosis and ended up in hospital. My father had to go back into a nursing home. And yet, thanks to that, our quality time returned. I would take him out for lunch every week or we would go for afternoon tea. He said he enjoyed his time in the nursing home, and that he felt safe and looked after there. The deterioration of an elderly person’s physical or mental health can feel so cruel and is often heartbreaking for their family. Yet in his last eight years, my father’s ageing was graceful. His mind remained sharp until the end, and we deepened our relationship during this final chapter of his life. There is still a stigma around nursing homes, particularly in my mother’s Japanese culture, where it is anathema, and you are expected to live with your elders at home until they die. For example, my Japanese grandmother lived with her son, my uncle, until her death. It was never an option to place her in a nursing home, although eventually she did enter a hospice. It is common in Japan for several generations to live under one roof. Elderly people are sacred in Japanese society; respecting your elders is embedded in Japanese DNA. I deeply felt these societal and cultural pressures to resist the nursing home for my father at all costs. I still feel guilty in some ways that he spent his final years there. But in the end, there was no other choice. Nursing homes might have a bad reputation for neglect and abuse, but I saw only the good. The tireless work of the staff and their endless supplies of empathy and care gave my father a new lease of life, one where he was safe and thriving rather than alone and neglected. For someone with complex health needs and a lack of a support system like my father, it was the perfect place to spend his remaining years. It provided respite to both of us, so we could enjoy life again. Jen McPherson is a student and freelance journalist In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393.

4/4/2022,"Izyum, south-east of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, has become a focus for the Russian military as it retreats from territory around Kyiv in northern Ukraine. The city once of 40,000 people is a gateway to the Donbas region. It has been a battleground since the start of the war, and although on Friday it fell to Russian forces, residents and military officials say intense fighting continues close to the city. “For three weeks there has been no civilisation. The city has been brought to ruins and intentionally so,” said Volodymyr Matsokin, the deputy mayor of Izyum, who has left the city but is working nearby and speaks to residents regularly. This is the story of one family in the city. Names have been changed to protect sources from possible Russian reprisals. “Yesterday morning started with hell,” my father, Andriy, told me when he called from Izyum last week. “There were as many bombs as there have been in the past month. The town centre was heavily bombed. It is shelled every minute. Even now when I tried to call you it’s going on.” Like all the residents of the occupied city, my father, 57, has survived for three weeks without electricity, heating or running water. He spends 15 minutes a day trying to “catch” the unstable mobile phone connection to call me. His house is now surrounded by trenches and destroyed houses and his new neighbours are Russian soldiers. They have prepared a list of individuals to “hunt”, people who may own a gun, are rich or “dangerous”, including businessmen, activists, military and their families. My father observed one hunt for a local businessman, who had already escaped when the raiding party arrived. To survive he takes water from the neighbours’ well, lives off preserves and dried food supplies and usually cooks on an open fire. He abandoned his bed at the start of the war and now sleeps in a corner of the house where he feels more protected by walls. “I’m already used to the cold. I sleep under two duvets and take the cat with me,” he told me. At that time it was snowing there. “You don’t hear when the bomb is coming. You just hear it half a second before it lands,” he said. Half the neighbours’ house has been destroyed. When the artillery starts, our house creaks and trembles. He hides our dog in the cellar. “Today I went to the city. God, everything is destroyed, there is not a single building still standing. First came the Russian planes, then came the answering fire,” he said. Authorities describe a list of war crimes recounted by those who have fled, which match reports from other parts of Ukraine. Russian soldiers have been accused of rape, kidnap, killing civilians and looting shops and homes. They have moved into civilian homes, in some cases kicking out residents, according to authorities. Many of Izyum’s residents are hiding in their basements, and some have died there under the rubble. Rescue workers do not have the right equipment to get people out after attacks, says Volodymyr Matsokin, the deputy mayor. There is nowhere to bury those who are found. “Some corpses are buried in the central park or near to the people’s houses and in gardens. The situation is like what it was in 1942. The morgue doesn’t work. Bodies were taken there at first but now it is too full,” Matsokin said. There are Russian bodies too, abandoned by their comrades in arms. “I have seen three armed vehicles full of corpses. There were bodies even lying on the roofs,” my father said. Shortages are costing lives. With the fighting and the Russian checkpoints barring passage of humanitarian convoys, food and medicine are running out. The hospital has been partly destroyed and people with diabetes or cancer cannot get treatment. My grandparents are still in the city. I haven’t seen them for two months or spoken to them for a month, after they refused to leave. They lived in a Ukrainian-controlled area but moved to the occupied part to stay with other family members who live there. They had not believed the war could start. As children of the Soviet Union, they were sure that Russia would never attack. At least 5,000 people need to be evacuated from the city but there is no safe way to escape any more. All of the bridges have been blown up, and the only crossing left is a partly destroyed footbridge. “I feel like it will take months to stop the war,” my father said during our last call, as the explosions continued. “I can’t imagine how it will end. Stalingrad continues.”",News/World news,No safe way out of Izyum: ‘I can’t imagine how it will end’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/izyum-ukraine-shelling-russian-soldiers
4/4/2022,"Who knows where Vivianne Miedema will play next season but for now she is Arsenal’s, and so important to Jonas Eidevall’s team. The Dutch striker has revealed that several clubs are interested in signing her for next season – she is out of contract in the summer – but there are no signs that her mind is elsewhere. When Arsenal thrashed Leicester City 5-0 on Sunday to briefly go top of the WSL the Netherlands international was in sparkling form. Miedema had two close efforts before half-time, one saved by goalkeeper Demi Lambourne and another smacked against the woodwork. Then came two goals in the space of eight second-half minutes that took Arsenal away from Leicester. Jemma Purfield’s clearance stopped at Miedema’s feet at the edge of the box and she executed a one-touch finish. Her second came after a well-worked assist from Nikita Parris. With the league’s title race going down to the wire, the Gunners will be hoping Miedema’s sparkle isn’t extinguished. SR As it happened: Leicester 0-5 Arsenal Chelsea cruised to a 5-0 victory over Reading on Sunday evening, returning to the top of the table in some style, back to being one point ahead of Arsenal. Emma Hayes’s attack has now racked up 27 goals in six games. But the more stellar stat has got to be that their latest clean sheet is their eighth in nine league games. Sure, any title-defending side should have the ability to do something similar but in recent outings Chelsea have been without their first-choice centre-back, holding midfielder and two attackers who play a huge role in their pressing game. So not only have they achieved this feat without their strongest team, but they’ve achieved it with players who have gone from being on the fringe to the first XI in a matter of weeks. MN Match report: Chelsea 5-0 Reading Sign up for our new and free women’s football newsletter now! Ella Toone became the first player in Manchester United Women’s history to reach 100 appearances for the club in their 1-0 win over Brighton on Sunday. She was presented with a framed shirt by manager Marc Skinner and celebrated the achievement with yet another stellar performance. She was lively in the opening 45 with three attempts at goal. Her closest came when she had a one-on-one with Katie Startup but the goalkeeper made a cracking save by closing down the midfielder. Toone didn’t dim in the second half, however, as she provided the assist to the goalscorer Leah Galton. The assist took her to eight this campaign, two more than anyone else. “She is a wonderful player for this club,” Skinner said. “She has lots of aspirations of being a top, top player. I love working with her every day to try and make her the player she wants to be.” SR A moment to cherish for @EllaToone99! 💯❤️#MUWomen pic.twitter.com/EZb3y6lFbA Manchester City enjoyed a satisfying Saturday afternoon in London, strolling to a 2-0 win against Olli Harder’s West Ham to keep the pressure on Manchester United for the last Champions League place. Gareth Taylor’s side are now three points behind United with a game in hand. “All we can do is attack the game in front of us,” Taylor said. “We’ll be attacking every game as it comes – that’s the most important thing.” Georgia Stanway and Khadija Shaw scored the goals and Taylor was delighted with the return of Chloe Kelly after her anterior cruciate ligament injury. “It’s great to have her back,” Taylor said. “It’s been a long time. It felt a bit strange, having not had her for that period of time.” Kelly will be another asset for Taylor as we head into the final straight of the season.

In particular it is the art of goalscoring that has deserted them. That the squad was hit by Covid and had to postpone two games has obviously not helped but Sunday’s 1-0 home defeat by Aston Villa was the team’s third straight fixture in which they have failed to find the net. Spurs dominated against Villa, Rachel Williams created a few half-chances and Ria Percival had a shot cleared off the line – but then Ramona Petzelberger popped up to score the winner with the visitors’ first effort on goal. MC Birmingham had only picked up four points from 17 games before their Friday night game and perhaps it is a sign of how Everton’s season is going that they managed a fifth against Chris Roberts’s side. True, Everton were dominant and should have won but the Birmingham goalkeeper Emily Ramsey made some impressive saves, leaving Everton 10th in the 12-team league. They should be far higher up with the squad they have and need to start preparing for next season already, including who the manager is going to be.

4/4/2022,"“We need to understand where we’ve been, in order to understand where we’re going,” says art historian Dr Jennifer Sliwka towards the end of this film about classical western art that focuses on the Easter story, and it neatly sums up the film’s basic proposition. This parade of masterpieces, from the Italian Quattrocento to German expressionism and beyond, speaks for itself as a colossal achievement of western civilisation that, as critic Rachel Campbell-Johnston points out, is predicated around suffering. In fact the various renditions of the Jesus passion are spectacular in their variety, seen here as they are back to back, and connected by readings from the New Testament. Giotto’s Entry into Jerusalem, Grünewald’s Isenheim Altarpiece, Bosch’s Christ Mocked (The Crowning with Thorns), Rembrandt’s The Descent from the Cross, Manet’s The Dead Christ with Angels, Caravaggio’s The Supper at Emmaus; this really is the sharp end of European cultural achievement, and one that is worth restating. This film is part of the long-running Exhibition on Screen series that resolutely brings the art-gallery experience into cinemas (and in a slightly truncated form) on to TV. This is in fact one of the rare occasions that the producers have not based their film around a blockbuster art show, or specific venue; apart from top-and-tail sequences inside an Easter service in St Petersburg’s St Vladimir’s Cathedral (a little poignant, considering the pariah that Russia has made of itself in recent weeks), this sticks to closeup shots of the works in question, sonorous Bible passages in voiceover, and occasional interview inserts. The simplicity of approach showcases the works rather well, even if the commentary is more restrained – and a bit on the defensive side, it has to be said – while the assembly of images that tells the story in chronological order possesses strength and power. Whatever your faith, or if you have none, there’s something of considerable interest here.

4/4/2022,"Don was in his third year of nurse training when he started a stint in intensive care at University College Hospital in London. “You could choose whether to do it in your first year or third year, but most of us wanted to wait until we had some experience, because it’s quite a difficult job,” he says. In March 1987, he walked on to the ward, feeling anxious. “I heard someone shout: ‘Hey!’ and thought it was really rude,” he remembers. “I was a cocky student at the time, so I turned around and said: ‘I’ve got a name, you know.’” That is when he spotted Tracey, a newly qualified intensive-care nurse who had been working on the ward for a month. “I’d actually been calling out to a colleague – ‘Jane!’ – and he’d misheard me.” But, as he was there, she asked him to help her prepare a bed for a patient who was due to be admitted from A&E. “I remember my heart going pitter-patter,” says Don. “I’d never met someone like her before.” Tracey says she remembers he had “lovely eyes”, but she was too focused on the job to pay him much attention. Over the next few weeks, they continued to do shifts together and got on brilliantly. Despite their spark, neither of them thought it would become romantic. “It didn’t seem ethical to date a student. Although there were no rules about it, it just didn’t feel right,” says Tracey. Don felt the same way. In May, his time in intensive care came to an end and he left the ward. Around the same time, Tracey was evicted from her house in Brixton and needed to find a new place to live. “I said: ‘I might know someone,’ and gave her my phone number,” says Don. “We arranged to meet for a drink to chat about it.” Before they met, Tracey’s boss found her a room in the specialist accommodation for nurses. “But we decided to go for drinks anyway,” she says. They went to Covent Garden. Although they liked each other, neither wanted anything serious. “I was planning to go travelling and possibly move to Australia,” says Tracey. But, the next day, Don began to change his mind. “I helped her move house and she turned this white painted space into a great home. It made me think she might be a keeper.” Their relationship developed quickly after that and, six months later, Don asked Tracey if she would consider marrying him one day. “I said: ‘I might say yes,’” she says. “I felt so safe around Don and trusted him completely. His integrity is really strong and our moral compasses aligned.” A month later, Don popped the question. In early 1988, the couple moved from London to Sawtry, a small village in Cambridgeshire. At the end of 1987, they had both nursed victims from the King’s Cross fire, which had been traumatic. “We needed to go somewhere else for a while, so we got jobs in a hospital in Peterborough,” says Tracey. They married in 1989 and their daughter was born in 1992. “She was born on my birthday, which was the best present ever,” says Don. A year later, Don joined the air force as a theatre nurse and the family spent many years moving around with his work, including two and a half years in Germany. In 2000, he left the air force and began a second career in health IT. Since 2003, they have lived in Stubbington, near Portsmouth, where Tracey works as a health visitor. “My grandfather always said you could see into someone’s soul through their eyes,” says Tracey. “Don’s kind eyes were the first thing I noticed and that stayed with me. He supports me and loves me no matter what and, now that we’ve been together so long, we can read each other perfectly.” Don appreciates his wife’s sense of humour. “We’re always laughing. Even if I’m having a miserable day, she always makes me feel better.” As a result of their jobs, they take a “seize the day” approach to life. “Working in nursing and seeing so much adversity in patients makes you realise how precious life is,” says Tracey. “We try to always remember to be grateful for what we have.” Want to share your story?

4/4/2022,"Can $50 change the trajectory of a child’s life? Los Angeles has invested millions of dollars to launch the largest universal child savings program in California with the hope that it can, a potential that experts say is backed by research. Last week the city opened more than 40,000 college savings accounts with balances of $50, as part of a plan to help give every first-grader in America’s second largest school district an account. Officials have heralded the program, which follows a similar experiment in San Francisco, as an important step to “help even the playing field” for students and encourage families to save for higher education. Experts say research has shown these programs, even with small amounts of cash, can have a profound impact. College costs have risen dramatically in recent decades – jumping 169% since 1980 – outpacing families’ ability to pay and putting some off going to university altogether. In California, tens of thousands of those seeking post-secondary degrees face homelessness and food insecurity amid the dual burdens of high tuition fees and a devastating statewide housing shortage. Los Angeles has said its program will help ensure more students attend college, citing data that students with college savings accounts of as little as $1-$499 are three times more likely to go to university and four times more likely to graduate. Similar programs have yielded promising results, research shows. CSA (children’s savings accounts) programs have taken off across the US in the last 15 years, said William Elliott, a professor and expert in college savings accounts, college debt and wealth inequality with the University of Michigan. According to a 2020 report, there are more than 100 child savings account programs in 36 states and Washington DC, serving nearly 1 million children. “Part of the way this is supposed to work theoretically is that it builds this future orientation and thinking about college and having that be a possible future for themselves,” said Terri Friedline, a professor of social work at the University of Michigan, who has researched improving the wellbeing of lower-income households through saving. The specifics of the programs vary, but generally involve states and cities awarding child savings accounts to children between the ages of birth and kindergarten or first grade, to which they can add savings and eventually access for college. Nevada launched the first statewide program in the US, which set up a college savings account with $50 for every kindergartner attending a public school. In Maine, every baby born after 2013 will automatically have a $500 grant invested for future education costs while in Pennsylvania every baby born since 2019 is eligible to receive an account with $100. In Los Angeles, accounts are available to all first-graders regardless of income or immigration status. Officials’ decision to use Citi accounts allows for undocumented families and others to be included, Elliott said. These programs also create systems that allow third-party donors to more easily contribute, he added. The funding is intended solely for education costs after high school, including two-year or four-year colleges, vocational schools as well as some trade schools. Every account comes with $50 in funding, and families are encouraged to set up regular contributions, which accrue interest over time. Students or parents can request an early withdrawal in the event of a family emergency. Officials behind the program looked to a similar effort in San Francisco, which introduced the first publicly funded universal children’s savings account program in the US. Since 2011, San Francisco has opened a college savings account with $50 for every kindergartner in city public schools, totaling nearly 50,000 accounts. In that time, 23% of students have put away $6.8m, according to the city’s data. Research on similar programs showed a correlation between CSAs and increased savings for college as well as more enrollment in four-year colleges. A study on a program in Boston aimed at seventh- to 10th-graders showed that families with accounts saved about $2,000 more over four to five years than those without, and were more likely to establish monthly contributions. Those findings are impressive for a program that’s not very intensive – that one started with just $50 in each student’s account – said Paco Martorell, an associate professor with the UC Davis school of education. And the benefits of CSA programs extends beyond their cash value, Elliott said. He pointed to research that shows positive effects on the social emotional development of kids, effects on parental practices – parents are less likely to use spanking – and even reduced maternal depression. “It’s not because they’re getting money in their hands, it’s more about understanding their kids have better future,” Elliott said, adding that adults who had savings as children are more likely to build other assets, investing in stocks and buying a home. Some critiques of such programs argue that the immediate needs of low-income people should be addressed before building future assets for children, a criticism Elliott said is misguided. “What assets give you is tangible hope. It says you have money stuck away that you’ll one day be able to use to go to college. That’s a different kind of hope,” he said. “Nobody wants to toil every day just to be able a find a way to eat, they want to have a stake in their future – that’s what this LA program is about … giving kids a tangible hope.” Such a program could eventually be rolled out statewide. Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, has introduced a plan to create college savings accounts for 3.7 million low-income children. This comes as the cost of attending a school within the University of California system has continued to rise. Students now pay between $35,000 and $38,000 a year to attend a UC between tuition, transportation and housing. Amanda Kahn Fried, the chief of policy and communications for the office of the San Francisco treasurer and tax collector, has also said such programs aren’t meant to solve the college affordability crisis but are aspirational. “It’s very clear to families that the amount you’re saving isn’t what’s important,” she told the LA Times. “It’s that you are taking the action; you’re talking about college with your children. You’re showing them that you believe in them and that the city believes in them.” Beyond CSA programs, there must be efforts to create systemic change, Friedline said. “We need to take steps to dismantle the systems that have excluded and marginalized poor and black and brown families,” she said.",News/Education,Can $50 change a child’s life?

4/4/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack is moving to capitalize on new momentum as it embarks on its final push to complete the roughly one hundred remaining depositions and conclude the evidence-gathering phase of the inquiry. The panel has scored two major wins in recent days: more than six hours of testimony from Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and a conclusion by a federal judge that the former president committed felonies to overturn the 2020 election. Members on the select committee believe Kushner’s cooperation might prompt other Trump officials to assist the investigation as the panel inches closer to Trump’s inner circle and the former president himself, according to sources familiar with the matter. The panel has also been buoyed by the federal court ruling that said Trump “more likely than not” violated the law over 6 January, reaffirming the purpose of the investigation and making it harder for Trump’s allies to defy the inquiry, the sources said. And members on the select committee believe that opening contempt of Congress proceedings against Trump aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino for ignoring their subpoenas, will reinforce the message that the panel will punish noncompliance, the sources said. “There’s a momentum to this process when there’s cooperation,” Jamie Raskin, one of the congressmen on the panel, said of the burst of recent activity. “When people see that others are doing the right thing, it gives them the courage to do the right thing.” The select committee has now conducted more than 800 depositions and interviews, obtained almost 90,000 documents and followed up on more than 435 tips received through the tip line on its website, since it started its work in earnest last August. House investigators also have more than 100 depositions remaining on the schedule, the sources said, including one with a key witness who is expected to reveal connections between the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups and the Capitol attack. That deposition – slated for 5 April – would represent another major breakthrough and could play a major role in establishing for the select committee whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy as part of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. It is so crucial, the sources said, since it could form part of the evidence to connect the militia groups that stormed the Capitol to the organizers of the rallies that immediately preceded the attack – who in turn are slowly being linked to the Trump White House. But that testimony has been on the books for several weeks, and the greater challenge for the select committee remains to resolve ongoing cooperation talks with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s onetime attorney, and Ivanka Trump, the former president’s daughter. The select committee has a special interest in Giuliani since he was in close contact with Trump as he oversaw the implementation of the scheme to have thenvice president Mike Pence stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win and return Trump to office. The Guardian first reported that Giuliani was poised to cooperate with the investigation and reveal the roles played by Republican members of Congress with caveats – such as not discussing matters covered by executive privilege – that are not yet resolved. House investigators have also identified Ivanka Trump as a key person of interest since she appeared to have learned before 6 January that the scheme to have Pence stop the certification was unlawful – but why the former president still went ahead with the plan. Testimony that speaks to whether Trump knew what he was pressing Pence to do was unlawful – and when he knew it – is a central question for the panel as it seeks to establish whether Trump’s actions should warrant a criminal referral to the justice department. The panel has also privately noted in recent days that Ivanka Trump might be able to shed light on who Trump was calling from the White House as the Capitol attack unfolded, after call logs from that day showed a near eight-hour gap in communications. The Guardian has revealed at least one of Trump’s phone calls on 6 January – when he dialed Republican senator Mike Lee trying to reach senator Tommy Tuberville – was routed through an official White House phone and should have been in the call logs but was not. As the select committee moves towards wrapping up the evidence-gathering phase of the investigation, the hope among its members is that the recent momentum will carry the inquiry through to public hearings that are now expected to start in mid-May. The panel remains undecided whether to demand cooperation from Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, after the Washington Post and CBS reported she pressed Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows in texts to overturn the 2020 election. The issue centers on the fact that several members on the select committee did not know about Thomas’s texts – turned over by Meadows months ago – until news reports brought them to public attention, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Some members wanted to call her in to ask her about the texts, but others who had discussed the issue months ago demurred, arguing that Thomas, a far-right activist, was unlikely to assist the panel and would try to turn the inquiry into a political circus. A spokesperson for the panel did not respond to a request for comment. The select committee may yet request cooperation from Thomas, but House investigators are pursuing myriad lines of inquiry and whether to ask her for voluntary assistance or demand documents and testimony pursuant to a subpoena is just one strand, the sources said.",News/US news,Capitol attack panel scores two major wins as it inches closer to Trump’s inner circle,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/04/capitol-attack-panel-inches-closer-to-trump-inner-circle
4/4/2022,"The devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on poor and low-income communities across America is laid bare in a new report released on Monday that concludes that while the virus did not discriminate between rich and poor, society and government did. As the US draws close to the terrible landmark of 1 million deaths from coronavirus, the glaringly disproportionate human toll that has been exacted is exposed by the Poor People’s Pandemic Report. Based on a data analysis of more than 3,000 counties across the US, it finds that people in poorer counties have died overall at almost twice the rate of those in richer counties. Looking at the most deadly surges of the virus, the disparity in death rates grows even more pronounced. During the third pandemic wave in the US, over the winter of 2020 and 2021, death rates were four-and-a-half times higher in the poorest counties than those with the highest median incomes. During the recent Omicron wave, that divergence in death rates stood at almost three times. Such a staggering gulf in outcomes cannot be explained by differences in vaccination rates, the authors find, with more than half of the population of the poorest counties having received two vaccine shots. A more relevant factor is likely to be that the poorest communities had twice the proportion of people who lack health insurance compared with the richer counties. “The findings of this report reveal neglect and sometimes intentional decisions to not focus on the poor,” said Bishop William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign which jointly prepared the research. “The neglect of poor and low-wealth people in this country during a pandemic is immoral, shocking and unjust.” The report was produced by the Poor People’s Campaign in partnership with a team of economists at the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) led by Jeffrey Sachs. They have number crunched statistics from more than 3,200 counties as a way of comparing the poorest 10% with the richest 10%. They then interrogate the interplay between Covid death rates and poverty, as well as other crucial demographic factors such as race and occupation. Until now the extent to which the virus has struck low-income communities has been difficult to gauge because official mortality data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and elsewhere has not systematically factored in income and wealth information. The new report seeks to fill that gaping hole in understanding of the US pandemic. One of its most striking findings is that within the top 300 counties with the highest death rates, 45% of the population on average lives below the poverty line as defined as 200% of the official poverty measure. Sachs, a Columbia University professor who is president of the UN SDSN, said the findings underlined how the pandemic was not just a national tragedy but also a failure of social justice. “The burden of disease – in terms of deaths, illness, and economic costs – was borne disproportionately by the poor, women, and people of color. The poor were America’s essential workers, on the front lines, saving lives and also incurring disease and death.” The authors rank US counties according to the intersection of poverty and Covid-19 death rates. Top of the list is Galax county, a small rural community in the south-west of Virginia. Its death rate per 100,000 people stands at an astonishing 1,134, compared with 299 per 100,000 nationally. Median income in the county is little more than $33,000, and almost half of the population lives below the poverty line. Among the counties with punishingly high poverty and death rates is the Bronx in New York city, where 56% of the population is Hispanic and 29% Black. More than half of the borough lives under the poverty line, and the Covid death rate is 538 per 100,000 – within the highest 10% in the US. Racial disparities have been at the centre of the pandemic experience in the US. Early on it became clear that Black people and Hispanics in New York city, for instance, were dying of Covid at twice the rate of whites and Asians. The consequences of such racial inequity are still only now becoming visible. Last week a study in the journal Social Science & Medicine reached a disturbing conclusion. It found that when white Americans were informed through the media that Black Americans were dying at higher rates than their demographic group was, their fear of the virus receded and they became less empathetic towards those vulnerable to the disease. They were also more likely to abandon Covid safety precautions such as masks and social distancing. But low-income predominantly white communities are also in peril. Mingo county in West Virginia, for example, has one of the lowest income levels in the US following the collapse of coal mining and the scourge of the opioid epidemic. The county is 96% white, with over half its residents living below the poverty line. Its Covid death rate is 470 per 100,000 – putting it within the top quarter of counties in the nation for pandemic mortality.",News/World news,Covid had devastating toll on poor and low-income communities in US,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/us-covid-devastating-toll-poor-low-income-communities
4/4/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Russia’s public image is now one of torture and execution after the retreat of Russian forces in the town of Bucha led to the discovery of the remains of hundreds of civilians. Calling Russian soldiers “murderers”, “butchers” and “rapists”, Zelenskiy said late on Sunday: “Your culture and human appearance perished together with the Ukrainian men and women.” He warned that “even worse things” may be found in other occupied regions. Ukrainian officials said the bodies of 410 civilians had been found in Kyiv area towns that were recently retaken from Russian forces. Satellite images taken late last week show a 14-metre (45ft) mass grave in Bucha near the Church of St Andrew and Pyervozvannoho All Saints. Maxar, the company that took the pictures, said the first signs of excavation for a mass grave there were seen on 10 March, several weeks into the invasion. What has Russia said about the reports coming out of Bucha? Russia’s foreign ministry said footage of dead civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha had been “ordered” by the US as part of a plot to blame Russia. Is rape being used as a weapon of war? There is a mounting body of evidence that summary executions, rape and torture have been used against civilians in areas under Russian control since the Kremlin launched the invasion of its neighbour on 24 February. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 39 of the Russian invasion. Growing evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine are “a punch to the gut”, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said yesterday, promising that the US would join its allies in documenting the atrocities to hold the perpetrators accountable. A retreat of Russian forces around Kyiv has revealed evidence of atrocities against civilians as Ukrainian troops and journalists have moved back into a broad swathe of suburbs and towns around the capital. “We can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalize this. This is the reality of what’s going on every single day as long as Russia’s brutality against Ukraine continues,” Blinken said on CNN’s State of the Union. “You can’t help but see these images as a punch to the gut. We said before Russia’s aggression we thought it was likely that they would commit atrocities. Since the aggression we’ve come out and said we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we’ve been working to document that to provide the information that we have to relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. “There needs to be accountability for it,” he added. What is the US government going to do go help Ukraine? Blinken would not be drawn on the details of US military aid being sent to Ukraine, but said the aim was “to make sure they have the systems they need”. The teenage pop phenom Olivia Rodrigo and the R&B duo Silk Sonic dominated the major categories, and Jon Batiste won album of the year at the 64th annual Grammys – a three-and-a-half-hour mega concert that mostly steered clear of politics or the pandemic, save for a virtual message from Zelenskiy and an emotional tribute to victims of the Russian invasion. A week after one of the most chaotic Oscars in recent memory – during which Will Smith slapped Chris Rock on stage – the Grammys seemed to revel in its technical proficiency and lack of controversy. “We’re gonna be listening to some music, we’re gonna be dancing, we’re gonna be singing, we’re gonna be keeping people’s names out of our mouths,” said host Trevor Noah in his opening monologue, acknowledging the elephant in the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. “Don’t even think of it as an awards show,” said Noah, who returned to the Grammys stage after emceeing last year’s Covid-straitened ceremony. “This is a concert where we give out awards.” What did Zelenskiy say? “The war doesn’t let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence. Our musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals, even to those who can’t hear them. But the music will break through anyway.” Police in Sacramento, California, are hunting for at least two suspects after six people were killed and 10 others injured during a shooting in the city’s downtown early yesterday morning. Three men and three women were among those killed but none of the victims have been identified yet. They survived intact for 112m years through scorching summer heat and freezing winters at Utah’s Mill Canyon, but several of the world’s most important and historic dinosaur footprints were damaged beyond repair earlier this year when a construction crew arrived to build a new boardwalk for tourists. The Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, who has governed the global financial hub through the unprecedented upheaval of anti-government protests and Covid-19, has said she will not seek a second five-year term of office. Lam took office in 2017 with a pledge to unite a city growing resentful of Beijing’s tightening grip. Viktor Orbán has won a fourth successive term as Hungary’s prime minister, capping a campaign dominated by his controversial stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine with a speech that appeared to mock Zelenskiy. In Sumirago, a suburb of Varese in Lombardy, where the verdant surrounds sit in the shadow of the famously pastel-tinted Monte Rosa, Rosita Missoni is describing the scene outside her window, writes Scarlett Conlon. “It really is a beautiful day, the sky is a bright blue and the mountain is white,” she says. “It’s why we came here originally, because of this fabulous view – and why my husband insisted on big windows everywhere.” Before the advent of contraception, becoming a parent couldn’t really be described as a decision at all. Perhaps this is why my search for historical sources that showed women interrogating the question was rather fruitless, writes Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett. Even speaking to women of older generations, who came of age post-contraception, there’s a sense that there wasn’t much thought given to the question. “It’s just what you did”, is a sentence that came up, time and time again. The world must abandon fossil fuels as a matter of urgency, rather than entrusting the future climate to untried “techno-fixes” such as sucking carbon out of the air, scientists and campaigners have urged, as governments wrangled over last-minute changes to a landmark scientific report. Governments have been accused of trying to water down the scientists’ findings, originally due to be published early today but – after delays and disagreements yesterday – postponed by six hours to later the same day. A 60-year-old man allegedly had himself vaccinated against Covid-19 dozens of times in Germany in order to sell vaccination cards to people who did not want to get the jab themselves. The man from the eastern Germany city of Magdeburg, whose name was not released in line with German privacy rules, is said to have received up to 90 shots against Covid at vaccination centres in Saxony for months until he was caught by police, the German news agency dpa reported on Sunday.

4/4/2022,"Russian forces are sending Ukrainian citizens to “filtration camps” before forcibly relocating them to Russia, according to the accounts of two women who said they were transported to Russian territory from the besieged city of Mariupol last month. “On 15 March, Russian troops stormed into our bomb shelter and ordered all the women and children to get out. It was not a choice,” said one woman who had been hiding with her family in a suburb of Mariupol since early March. “People need to know the truth, that Ukrainians are being moved to Russia, the country that is occupying us.” Ukrainian officials have accused Russian troops of transporting several thousand Mariupol residents through “filtration camps” and forcibly moving them to Russia through the Russian-controlled republics in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has denied these accusations, claiming “such reports are lies”. Russian officials have previously said 420,000 people have been voluntarily evacuated to Russia “from dangerous regions of Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics”. The women requested anonymity because they were concerned about the safety of their relatives who are still in the heavily shelled city. Their accounts, along with similar stories published by the Washington Post and the BBC and reports from human rights groups, contradict Russian claims that Ukrainians are not being forcibly moved to Russia. The southern port of Mariupol came under heavy fire from Russian forces soon after the invasion of Ukraine, with many families seeking refuge in bomb shelters. Russian troops have since taken control of large parts of the damaged city. After leaving her shelter, the first woman said she was bussed with “two or three hundred” others to the border town Novoazovsk, in the Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine. “Once we came to a stop, we had to wait for hours inside the bus until ordered to go through a large tent complex, to what everyone called ‘filtration camps’.” A satellite image captured by the US-based Maxar Technologies last week showed tented camps set up in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne, near Novoazovsk. Representatives of the two self-proclaimed republics in the Donbas have said they have set up a “tent city of 30 tents” for Mariupol residents, with the capacity to hold up to 450 people. A report in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, a newspaper owned by the Russian government, said that 5,000 Ukrainians had been processed at the camp in Bezimenne and undergone checks to prevent “Ukrainian nationalists from infiltrating Russia disguised as refugees so they could avoid punishment”. The woman described how she was photographed and fingerprinted once she entered the camp. She was then “extensively questioned” by men who presented themselves as members of Russia’s FSB security service. “They went through my phone; they asked if I knew anything about the Ukrainian army, if I had friends in the military,” she said. “They also asked me what I thought about Ukraine, about Putin and about the conflict. It was very degrading.” After passing through the “filtration camp”, which took a few hours, according to the woman, the group was eventually taken to Rostov, a city 80 miles (130km) east of the Ukrainian border. Once there, the group was told that their final destination would be Vladimir, a city just over 100 miles (160km) east of Moscow. But in Rostov, the woman decided to separate from the main group, telling the Russian guards she had family living there. “They let me go without much hassle. But for many, leaving was simply not an option,” she said. The woman recalled that many on the bus complained that they were given only a few minutes to gather their belongings and often did not have any money or official papers, making it complicated to leave Russia afterwards. After separating from the group, the woman made her way first to Moscow by bus and then took a train to St Petersburg. She said she was now safe after crossing the border to an EU country on foot. The scale of Russia’s reported forced deportations remains unclear. The Helping to Leave Fund, a Russian-run group that addresses the needs of people relocated to Russia from Ukraine, said they had received about 200 requests from deported Ukrainians asking them for help. “Each of those requests usually comes from a whole family, so the actual number of people deported is higher,” said Maria Ivanova, a representative of the group. Ivanova said the group saw an increase in requests for help from 28 March and heard first-hand reports of “long lines” at the “filtration camps”. The reported deportations have raised alarm among international human rights groups. “These people weren’t given any option to evacuate to a safer place in Ukraine. Many found themselves in a situation when their only choice was essentially crossing into Russia or dying as shelling grew more intense,” said Tatyana Lokshina, associate director for the Human Rights Watch’s Europe and central Asia division. “Under international human rights law, forced displacement or transfer doesn’t necessarily mean people were forced into a vehicle at gunpoint, but rather that they found themselves in a situation that left them no choice.” Lokshina pointed to the Geneva convention, under which “individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory, are prohibited, regardless of their motive”. A second woman the Guardian talked to gave a similar account of her forced transport from Mariupol through a “filtration camp” in Novoazovsk. “I never asked to be taken away. The filtration camps, the journey, it has been very traumatic,” said the woman, who left the city on a Russian bus on 16 March. She is currently in Rostov, planning her route out of the country. Russian officials have openly talked about their efforts to relocate what they call “Ukrainian temporarily displaced people.” The Russian defence ministry has posted almost daily about its efforts to evacuate Ukrainian civilians “trapped” in Mariupol. The governor of Vladimir told local media that his city had received over 1,000 “refugees” from territories “liberated” by Russia, including Mariupol. Not everyone who has been moved from Ukraine to Russia said they were unhappy to do so. “I wanted to go to Russia; I am glad to be safe. And my family lives here, so I was looking for how to get here,” said Vladimira, a third woman from Mariupol who spoke to the Guardian, who has since moved in with family members in Rostov. Mariupol is just 37 miles from the Russian border, and many of its residents have relatives on the other side. While the invasion has dramatically decreased pro-Russian sentiment in the city, Vladimira said she welcomed the safety that she felt moving to Russia offered. She also confirmed that she had gone through “filtration camps” but said they did not bother her as she was just “glad to be out of danger”. “There is certainly a group of people that have been moved out of Mariupol who will not mind being in Russia. Who will stay there,” said Ivanova from the Helping to Leave Fund. “But we know of hundreds who were moved against their will. That is extremely worrying.”",News/World news,"Hundreds of Ukrainians forcibly deported to Russia, say Mariupol women",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/hundreds-of-ukrainians-forcibly-deported-to-russia-say-mariupol-women
