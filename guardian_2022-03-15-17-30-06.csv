3/15/2022,"The Liberal party’s infighting over preselecting federal candidates is heading back to the supreme court after a member of the NSW state executive began fresh legal action on Tuesday, challenging the federal party’s intervention to save two ministers and a sitting MP. A member of the NSW state executive, Matthew Camenzuli, has filed in the NSW supreme court a challenge to the endorsement of the sitting MPs, which was achieved last week by a brief takeover of the troubled NSW branch by a special committee appointed by the federal party. The new legal action was confirmed by executives in the Liberal party and sets the scene for a further ugly public stoush just weeks before the federal election, due in May. A three-person committee, acting on behalf of the prime minister, Scott Morrison, took over the NSW branch for 72 hours last week and endorsed the immigration minister and member for Mitchell, Alex Hawke, the environment minister and MP for Farrer, Sussan Ley, and the MP for North Sydney, Trent Zimmerman, who is a key figure in the moderate faction. All three had been facing challenges for preselection. In the case of Ley, she was likely to lose her seat to a conservative right-winger, Christian Ellis, if a branch vote was held. The other two MPs faced an uncertain outcome. Morrison has made it clear he wants his ministers and Zimmerman to run again. The brief takeover was deemed necessary by the federal executive after months of delays within the NSW branch, which has been unable to schedule rank and file preselections in up to nine winnable seats because of a bitter factional war. Under changes to the NSW Liberal party constitution introduced in 2018 and championed by former prime minister Tony Abbott, the NSW party was supposed to allow branch members a much bigger say in candidate selection via branch plebiscites, which gave ordinary members a vote. Instead, factional warlords in the party have attempted to delay the process – there was a nine month delay in vetting possible candidates – and they have instead been attempting a carve-up of winnable seats. But this too has stalled. The rules require a 90% vote to overrule the constitution and install candidates administratively. With just weeks until the federal election in May, the Liberal party is without candidates in Warringah, Hughes, Eden-Monaro and Parramatta. The NSW division appeared to be edging toward holding plebiscites to choose candidates in these seats, but time is running out and some fear the federal executive is again planning to intervene. Camenzuli, a strong supporter of plebiscites, appears to have decided to take the matter to the courts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells sent a bulletin to members on Tuesday afternoon announcing Camenzuli had commenced proceedings in the court to “uphold your rights and challenge the validity of the committee’s decision to impose candidates in New South Wales”. “There is now a serious question as to the legality of the processes that the federal executive has ‘imposed’ on our division,” who is backing the move, she wrote. “What is the precedent that is being set when a ‘captain’s pick’ can be foisted on our division by the federal executive? “I believe that the ‘manufactured’ delay in selecting candidates was deliberately designed to avoid plebiscites and trample on the rights of members!” she wrote. “What is the point of our NSW Liberal Party Constitution if it can be trodden on and overridden in such a callous manner? I appreciate some may argue ‘what’s done is done’ and ‘best get on with it’ but this is not a precedent we can tolerate and let stand!” Fierravanti-Wells is also facing an uncertain future as there are multiple candidates including senator Jim Molan competing for the third winnable spot on the Coalition’s Senate ticket. Comment has been sought from the federal Liberal party.",News/Australia news,Fresh court challenge filed in Liberal party’s NSW preselection stoush,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/fresh-court-challenge-filed-in-liberal-partys-nsw-preselection-stoush
3/15/2022,"Camelot is to lose its licence to run the UK national lottery after 28 years as the Gambling Commission named rival Allwyn as its preferred applicant to take over. Allwyn, which is owned by the Czech group Szaka, Europe’s largest lottery operator, is expected to take over from Camelot in 2024. “The selection of Allwyn as preferred applicant follows a fair, open and robust competition which received four applications at the final stage,” the Gambling Commission said. “The Gambling Commission is content that all applicants are fit and proper to operate the national lottery. Recognising our role as a responsible regulator we are also satisfied that no application is impacted by sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine.” As part of its bid Allwyn pledged to donate £38bn to good causes over the next decade, almost equivalent to the £45bn Camelot raised since it began running the national lottery in 1994. “Our priority was to run a competition that would attract a strong field of candidates,” said the Gambling Commission chief executive, Andrew Rhodes. “Having received the most applications since 1994, it is clear we’ve achieved just that. We look forward to working with all parties to ensure a smooth handover.” Camelot has been named as the reserve applicant. This means it would continue to run the lottery “in the event that finalisation could not be achieved with the preferred candidate”. Allwyn, which is run by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek, has also proposed reducing ticket prices from £2 to £1 and having two draws on one night. The Allwyn chairman, Sir Keith Mills, was instrumental both in winning the 2012 Olympics bid for London and in organising the Games. In the world of business, he is revered as the brains behind air miles and Sainsbury’s Nectar card. Allwyn’s star-studded advisory board also includes the former Sainsbury’s chief executive Justin King and the venture capital guru Brent Hoberman, and it is working with Vodafone on the technology underpinning its bid. “I am confident that the success of the competition will lead to a highly successful fourth licence,” said Rhodes. “One that maximises returns to good causes, promotes innovation, delivers against our statutory duties, and which ultimately protects the unique status of the national lottery.” The other biggest bidders for the licence were the Italian operator Sisal, which is now jointly owned by Flutter, the owners of betting brands including Paddy Power and SkyBet; the private equity group CVC; and the New Lottery Company, which is run by Richard Desmond’s Northern & Shell.",News/UK news,Camelot to lose licence to run UK national lottery after 28 years ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/camelot-licence-uk-national-lottery-allwyn-entertainment
3/15/2022,"Unemployment in the UK has fallen below pre-Covid levels, but high inflation amid Britain’s cost of living crisis means average wages fell at the fastest rate since 2014. The Office for National Statistics said the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the three months to January, dropping below the 4% rate last in February 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the UK. However, while a sharp rise in employment amid record job vacancies highlighted a steady recovery in the labour market from Covid, the latest figures show average wages plunged after taking into account high rates of inflation. Against a backdrop of soaring energy bills and the rising cost of the weekly shop, the ONS said annual growth in regular pay, excluding bonuses, fell by 1% after adjusting for its preferred measure of inflation in the three months to January – the biggest fall since July 2014. The latest snapshot showed the number of job vacancies rose to a fresh record high of 1.3m, suggesting a sustained increase in demand for workers after the end of furlough and despite the emergence of the Omicron variant hitting the economy. Employment continued to rise over the period, although the official employment rate remained one percentage point below pre-pandemic levels amid a decline in the number of self-employed workers and more older staff leaving the workforce. Analysts said the strength in the labour market suggested the Bank of England was likely to increase interest rates again on Thursday in response to soaring inflation. Average wages, including bonuses, rose at an annual rate of 4.8% before taking account of inflation – a faster rate than expected by City economists. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said the government’s economic support measures had driven a stronger jobs market rebound than many observers predicted. “I am confident that our labour market is in a good position to deal with the current global challenges,” he said. “We know people are concerned about the rising cost of living so alongside continuing to help people find great jobs – we’re providing direct support worth more than £20bn this financial year and next.”",News/Business,UK unemployment falls below pre-Covid level but inflation hits wages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-unemployment-covid-inflation-wages-prices-energy-bills
3/15/2022,"Boris Johnson has urged the west to end its “addiction” to Russian fuel as he heads for Saudi Arabia in a push for increased oil output. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, the UK prime minister said western leaders had made a “terrible mistake” by letting President Vladimir Putin “get away with” annexing Crimea in 2014 and becoming more dependent on Russian power sources. Johnson is expected to travel to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday evening despite an outcry over the regime’s execution of 81 men on Saturday. He will have talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the hope Saudi Arabia can raise its production of oil and gas to make up for a reduced reliance on Russia. Johnson said the west’s reliance on Russian fuel had “emboldened” Putin to bomb civilians during his invasion of Ukraine, while at the same time profiting from soaring global oil and gas prices. He said: “We cannot go on like this. The world cannot be subject to this continuous blackmail. As long as the west is economically dependent on Putin, he will do all he can to exploit that dependence. And that is why that dependence must – and will – now end.” Last week, the UK government announced a plan to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year. Stating that Russia produced “virtually nothing else … [the] rest of the world wants to buy”, Johnson said: “If the world can end its dependence on Russian oil and gas, we can starve [Putin] of cash, destroy his strategy and cut him down to size.” He said there was a need to press ahead with investment in renewables, including expanding the number of UK offshore wind farms and creating more solar power. Johnson also said there needed to be a “series of big new bets” on nuclear power to make sure the UK’s energy supply was “no longer at the mercy of bullies like Putin”. However, the prime minister warned the British public that diverging from Russian power would be “painful” and that the financial assistance offered by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to help pay with rising bills this year could not be afforded “for long”. James Cleverly, a Foreign Office minister, said the UK continued to express opposition to the death penalty in its communications with Saudi Arabia. Speaking on Sky News, he said: “The UK has a longstanding and principled opposition to the use of the death penalty. We will have communicated back to Saudi Arabia. I have no doubt we will do so in response to the executions that have been recently announced.” Cleverly refused to be drawn on whether the government would lift a ban on fracking to increase gas supply. He said: “I get the importance of securing energy in the short term – that is an incredibly important point. But ultimately the really important thing for us to focus on is moving away from our addiction to hydrocarbons. He added: “The situation in Ukraine presents a unique and terrible additional emphasis to us collectively to move away from our addiction on hydrocarbons. And it’s absolutely right we seek to do that because it’s the right thing to do for the environment and it denies Russia an incredibly important source of income that they rely upon to fund this war.” Before his flight to Riyadh, Johnson was due to host leaders from the Joint Expeditionary Force, an alliance of northern European countries. Representatives from Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway had been expected to dine with Johnson at his Chequers country retreat on Monday night before talks in London on Tuesday.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson vows to end ‘addiction’ to Russian fuel ahead of Saudi Arabia trip,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/15/boris-johnson-saudi-arabia-trip-russian-fuel-addiction
3/15/2022,"Ira Glass is a few minutes late for our interview by video chat, and when he does arrive, he turns on the camera before he’s settled down, so I watch as he removes his cycling detritus, blows his nose and tidies his desk. When he finally speaks, he forgets to turn off the mute button. Despite being one of the most revered interviewers in the US, winner of every award from a Peabody to a George Polk, Glass is not a very smooth interviewee. “I feel like I’m giving you too many answers to your questions. I know you’ll just pick whichever ones you want but, of course, I’m editing as I’m speaking to you so I’m thinking: ‘OK, that was good. No, that was pointless … ’” he says at one point, with a laugh that is equal parts angst and amusement. Glass, who has the nasal voice and nerdily handsome looks of an attractive suburban maths teacher, is the founder and host of the long-running radio show and podcast This American Life. He started it in the mid-90s with the objective to tell stories – through interviews and narrative – about normal people. Not rich people, not famous ones, not beautiful ones; just people. It now gets more than 4 million listeners every week and is widely credited with starting the podcast revolution. If podcasting is to the 2020s what standup comedy was to the 1970s, Glass is podcasting’s Steve Martin, the man who showed how big it could be. Although when I say that to him, he says with mock-but-actually-a-bit-real outrage that Martin has a podcast in his new TV show, Only Murders in the Building: “He does the sound all wrong! It’s a crime! People on that show should know how to place a microphone!” Typical This American Life episodes include 24 hours in a diner, in which the reporters chat with the patrons who come in, or interviewing asylum seekers in a refugee camp in Mexico, as they wait to hear if they can get into the US. That last episode won a Pulitzer and is an example of how the show – to my mind – has become more political over the past five years, while staying true to its original mission of focusing on people’s stories. “As a staff, we became very obsessed with immigration policy under President Trump, but I feel like those are the stories that you have to trick the audience into listening to – not because they’re bad people, but because the story’s not that complicated,” Glass says. “So people are like: ‘Yeah, I get it, it’s really sad.’ You have to be cunning in the way you begin, you need something funny at the top, and so we start with a little kid in the tent camp, just charming the pants off everybody. Then we pull back.” Does he think the show has become more serious than it was a decade ago, when they made episodes such as a reporter getting over a breakup by learning how to write the perfect love song, or David Sedaris – whom Glass discovered and launched – doing his food shopping in Paris? “I think the show has suffered since the pandemic, as it’s been a very serious show. All of us are stuck in our houses, and there are big, serious things to document. When we started, we wanted it to be the best journalism it could be, but we were also, very consciously and unashamedly, just out to amuse. So I think our best episodes are funny for quite a bit and then get serious. Like an old-fashioned Broadway musical.” For this reason, his favourite episode is 129 Cars, which follows a car dealership trying to sell its monthly quota – basically, Glengarry Glen Ross with Chryslers. “There’s a lot of cursing in that. I love cursing,” he says. As a teenager, Glass was more interested in comedians than journalists. He has parlayed his radio success into live events, including a deeply improbable yet critically acclaimed This American Life live show six years ago, which featured Glass and professional dancers. Now he’s coming to the UK with Seven Things I’ve Learned: An Evening With Ira Glass. Did he not want to wait a bit longer so he could learn more and round it up to 10? “I feel like with 10, you feel the audience ticking them off,” he says, hyperconscious as always about the interplay between story structure and the listeners’ interest levels. With the content, however, he’s more relaxed: “The seven things change depending on my mood. So it’s a mix of some things that took me a long time to figure out, like how to tell a story on the radio, and then some things that just seem like fun things to tell an audience.” No other modern radio show has been as influential as This American Life. Now, loads of shows do nonfiction long-form narratives but This American Life was the one that made them big. “And it’s great for me that so many people do it because it’s become easier to hire people,” Glass says, unfussed by the copycats. Radio controllers used to ask him when he would get a “real presenter”, because his informal style, full of pauses and beats, was so different from the Kent Brockman-like voice American listeners were used to. His style has since become so ubiquitous it’s the voice of every podcast: Podcast Voice. Can he hear it when other presenters copy him? “Yeah,” he says a little embarrassed, and then he perks up again. “But it’s very gratifying that people notice the work and think: ‘Oh, that looks fun.’ If I’d had the mind to want something, that would have been a good thing to want. Instead, I just thought: ‘Let’s try to make this week’s show and keep our jobs.’” Glass was born and brought up in Maryland, the son of a businessman and a marriage therapist. Like his mother, he’s a talker. “My mom was good at talking and my dad wasn’t. A typical male-female relationship,” he says. He was raised Jewish but is now an atheist, although, he says, “Your cultural heritage isn’t a suitcase you can leave at the airport.” I say I can tell that from the writers he has showcased on This American Life: David Rakoff, Jon Ronson, Jonathan Gold, Shalom Auslander, even the non-Jewish Sedaris – they all have a distinctly Jewish flavour to their writing, that highly self-aware comic outsider looking in. “I never really thought about that; I just thought: ‘These people are pretty good.’ But I can see that,” he says. This American Life has always mixed first-person pieces with reportage. But some questions have been raised about whether the two can mix on The Trojan Horse Affair, a recently released eight-part series on This American Life’s offshoot podcast, Serial, which is produced with the New York Times – although Glass remains an editor on it. In 2013, Birmingham city council received an anonymous letter claiming there was an Islamist plot to take over local schools. Teachers and governors were fired and Peter Clarke, a counter-terrorism expert, was appointed to conduct an inquiry, although most now accept the letter was a hoax. Serial regular Brian Reed and journalism student and Birmingham local Hamza Syed investigate the story, but some critics have questioned Syed’s neutrality, especially as we find out on the podcast that he told a potential source that his aim was to “change the narrative” about the Trojan Horse letter. The New York Times has already issued one correction regarding the misrepresentation of a source and the secularism campaign group Humanists UK released a recording that it says showed its interview on the podcast was edited misleadingly. Glass says he hasn’t seen the criticisms so can’t address them specifically, so I ask him about the occasional shading between activism and journalism: how can a story be objective if a journalist begins with a specific aim? “I’m not someone who believes in objectivity. I think that’s really a conversation that gets you nowhere. But I do believe in fairness, where all sources are treated equally and that’s what we do. And there are definitely stories that we do here because we think: ‘That seems kinda fucked up,’” he says. Glass doesn’t often talk about his personal life on the show, but in 2017 he told listeners that he and Anaheed Alani, his wife of 12 years, had separated. The year before, he had told this paper that they regularly went to marriage counselling. Are some problems just too big to talk out? “In our case, talking was not the solution. There was a tremendous amount of talking. But, um, yeah,” he says, with a subject’s-closed smile. Glass never wanted kids, but he’s now in a relationship with a woman who has an eight-year-old son. “I never understood why you’d want kids. It just seemed like so much work and what do you get out of it? And now I’m like: ‘Oh, now I get it,’” he says and laughs. Some things, it turns out, can’t be talked through; they need to be experienced. Our time is up and I tell Glass I will let him get on with his working day, and his face lightens, eager to be back in the more comfortable seat of the interviewer rather than the interviewed. “OK, cool, bye, bye, uh, bye!” he says, as he tries, and fails, to turn off the video chat. Until I finally put him out of his misery, and turn it off for him.

3/15/2022,"The hymns were still playing and the sermons were still being read, but the cathedral was in flames. The Parc des Princes, this monument to glory and desire, the place where you go to see your fantasies made flesh, was in revolt. They were watching Paris Saint-Germain, their team, rip Bordeaux to shreds with perhaps the most preposterously dazzling front three in the history of football. And they were furious about it. Lionel Messi was booed, by many of the same fans who lined the streets to celebrate his arrival in August. Neymar was booed when he scored and cheered when he missed. It was profane and it was shocking and maybe that was the point. “We understand their disappointment, we understand their hatred,” the PSG centre-half Presnel Kimpembe said. “Now we must move forward in order to win Ligue 1.” The immediate assumption was that this was a sort of acid reflux, an intestinal reaction to the Champions League defeat against Real Madrid in midweek. On social media, fans of other clubs brandished their tiny violins. Fifteen points clear in Ligue 1, close to an eighth title in 10 seasons and with a front-row seat to the greatest show in world football. Maybe, you know, grow up? But Paris has been at war with itself for a while now, for reasons that go far deeper than one second-half capitulation. Last month, the fan group Collectif Ultras Paris organised a picket of the fixture against Rennes, denouncing the Qatari owners, the sporting director, Leonardo, and even the head of communications. There were demands to “respect the women’s team.” One banner even referenced the revolutionary reign of terror: “Too many useless heads! Robespierre, where are you?” And people say this club has no sense of history. Watching from the directors’ box on Sunday was Nasser Al-Khelaifi, the club president who, since 2011, has spent more than £1bn in transfer fees and overseen the most successful era in PSG’s history. As the team he built was pilloried, it was possible to picture his puzzlement. Hang on. I bought you Messi, Neymar, Mbappé, Ibrahimovic, Cavani, Dani Alves. What more, exactly, do you want? Of course, Paris fans have told Khelaifi exactly what they want. In a statement by the Collectif last week, they asked him: “How can you want to change everything for the people of Paris when you’re more often seen at Fashion Week than meeting with your own fans?” They demanded his resignation “in the greater interest of a club; not a brand, not a marketing product. Our club!” Kimpembe may have claimed to understand the fans’ anger, but his Ligue 1 comment betrayed the fact he hadn’t a clue. Paris are 15 points clear of Marseille. Silverware isn’t the problem here. The ultras’ statement didn’t mention the Champions League at all. Rather, the barracking of Neymar and Messi felt like an expression of a more fundamental need: a longing that no quantity of star signings or precious metal can truly fulfil. If Khelaifi reckons a Champions League crown will placate the restless natives, he should look at the competition’s past two winners. Bayern Munich are sauntering towards their 10th Bundesliga in a row, but at their most recent annual general meeting angry fans turned on the club president, Herbert Hainer, and the chief executive, Oliver Khan, for refusing to discuss the club’s controversial sponsorship deal with Qatar. “We are Bayern! You are not!” members shouted at club officials who condescendingly invited them to pursue their grievances in court. Chelsea fans, meanwhile, have been forced to watch the dismemberment of their club in real time. Again, sympathy will be in short supply. Some clearly see themselves as the real victims of the war in Ukraine, continuing to serenade their sanctioned owner Roman Abramovich. But for the silent majority and dickhead minority alike, the common theme is a basic powerlessness, the sense that the thing they care about is simply a piece in somebody’s Monopoly game. You could equally shift the focus to Manchester United or Tottenham, to Liverpool where an unconditional love for the team masks an underlying suspicion of the club’s ownership, or Manchester City where the fanbase seems to be on a permanent war footing, fixated on slights and enemies. These are fans of the world’s biggest clubs, home to its best players, reared on a diet of what 99% of the game would consider as unimaginable success. Why is nobody happy? Perhaps the answer lies in a common realisation, sharpened by the Super League protests and subsequent events: that wins and new signings are no real substitute for a genuine stake. For decades all fans, but especially those of big clubs, have essentially been commodified, patronised, seen not as partners but as eyeballs, a resource to be tapped. Supporter groups demand a place on the board and a share in the future. Clubs respond with viral content, soaring ticket prices and fan tokens. And so for the most part following a superclub has become a pursuit of ever-diminishing returns: a doomed search for lost meaning in an increasingly transactional relationship. “Our club,” the Paris ultras insisted. But it isn’t and Khelaifi has the documents to prove it. In a sense these protests feel like a natural end point: an overdue recognition these are no longer our clubs and this is no longer our game. You can’t bring down the church. But there comes a point where you may just stop believing.",Sport/Football,Pursuit of happiness: the problem with supporting one of football’s super clubs | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/15/pursuit-of-happiness-the-problem-with-supporting-one-of-footballs-super-clubs
3/15/2022,"Arm is planning to cut up to 15% of its workforce, the UK computer chipmaker has said, just over a month after the collapse of its $40bn (£30bn) sale to its US rival Nvidia. The Cambridge-based company said most of the job losses, totalling up to about 1,000 roles, would be in the UK and the US. Arm employs more than 6,500 people worldwide, including 3,000 in the UK. Arm said: “Like any business, Arm is continually reviewing its business plan to ensure the company has the right balance between opportunities and cost discipline. Unfortunately, this process includes proposed redundancies across Arm’s global workforce.” In February, SoftBank shelved its blockbuster sale of Arm to Nvidia, citing regulatory hurdles, and said it would instead seek to list the company. SoftBank had acquired Arm in 2016. The value of the proposed sale, which depended on Nvidia’s stock price, was pegged at about $40bn but rose with Nvidia‘s stock price to about $80bn late last year. The deal, which would have been the largest in the semiconductor industry, had become mired in red tape on both sides of the Atlantic and in China. It had also faced fierce opposition from players within the industry since it was announced in September 2020. SoftBank said at the time it would revert to its backup plan of an initial public offering to cash in on Arm, and was to receive a $1.25bn break-up fee from Nvidia. Nvidia said despite the failed takeover it would remain a close partner because of Arm’s strategic importance in the global chip industry. The Prospect general secretary, Mike Clancy, said: “Arm is one of the most important providers of high-quality tech jobs in the UK. This latest news will send shockwaves to thousands of Arm employees worried about their jobs. “We always knew there was a risk once the sale to Nvidia fell through that the company would seek to restructure or cut costs. We urgently need leadership from government now to protect British jobs and British research and development spending.”",News/Business,"UK chipmaker Arm to cut up to 1,000 jobs after $40bn sale collapses",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-chipmaker-arm-cut-jobs-sale-uk-us-nvidia
