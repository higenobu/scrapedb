5/7/2022,"The weakening of the human connection to nature might be good for economic growth but is bad for people. A tipping point was reached in 2020 when human-made materials – such as steel, concrete and plastic – were found to weigh more than all life on Earth. Continuing to grow concrete forests rather than real ones is shortsighted. Simply being in the nearest wood, with attention and sensory intent, has such health benefits that the Woodland Trust successfully lobbied for it to be prescribed by doctors. Yet slipping from popular culture is the wonder and beauty of the natural world. For every three nature-related words in hit songs of the 1950s, researchers found, there was only slightly more than one 50 years later. It is not a moment too soon that teenagers will be able to take a natural history GCSE, given that for decades children have been able to name more video game characters than wildlife species. In 2017, polls suggested that a third of young children thought cheese came from plants. Part of remedying this social malaise would be for parliament to pass a “right to grow” law, allowing anyone to turn underused public spaces into vegetable gardens and orchards. The idea is for people to get back in touch with the soil – and themselves – while producing food sustainably. Under the proposals, devised by the guerrilla gardening project Incredible Edible, councils would have to maintain a list of public land suitable for “community cultivation”. Local people and volunteer groups could apply to cultivate the land, without being charged, for an agreed period. It does work. More than a decade ago Incredible Edible began growing food on pockets of neglected public land in Todmorden, Yorkshire. The council was supportive, providing lists of possible sites. Corn sprouted in front of police stations and an apothecary garden flowered at the health centre. The movement spread quickly across the town and was so successful that tourists began to arrive. “Propaganda gardening”, they called it; more than 170 Incredible Edible cells have now taken root across Britain and 1,000 around the world. Gardening, say the founders, makes for a kinder, more connected community. Radical vegetable planting has a venerable lineage. In April 1649, Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers (or True Levellers) responded to high prices and food shortages by cultivating vegetables on common land at St George’s Hill, near Weybridge in Surrey. Community gardening can be traced back centuries. The practice of throwing seed bombs to turn vacant plots of land green took off in 1970s New York, and has been revived by green-thumbed social media influencers who flout local US regulations in a war on urban eyesores. Apart from the urgent task of providing more healthy nutrients to those who increasingly can’t afford them, publicly accessible fruit and vegetable gardens connect what we eat to where it comes from – the means of production, if you will. They can make unlovely spaces lovely, and marry use and beauty as well as helping to foster a sense of community. Plants are also, of course, our first defence against species loss and climate change. Such planting is a small step for humanity – in the right direction.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on guerrilla gardening: go forth and grow | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/06/the-guardian-view-on-guerrilla-gardening-go-forth-and-grow
5/7/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has warned he is willing to miss the Miami Grand Prix as he refuses to back down in a stand-off with Formula One’s governing body the FIA, over the wearing of jewellery in the car. Hamilton was highly critical of the FIA for focusing on the rule in what he said had become a silly spat. Rules state drivers are not permitted to wear jewellery in the car for safety reasons. The regulation has not been rigidly enforced until this season when Niels Wittich, the new race director, informed drivers he would be clamping down and checking they were not wearing jewellery. Wittich is understood to be strongly backed in the move by the new FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem. In Miami however Hamilton, who noted he had worn his nose and ear rings in the car without issues for most of his career and that they could not be removed, made it clear he would defy the ruling even if it meant he was ruled ineligible to compete. “If they stop me, so be it, we have a spare driver, so we are ready and prepared for the weekend,” he said. “There’s lots to do in the city anyway so I’ll be good either way.” Hamilton said he tried contacting Sulayem directly to try to solve the issue but had received no reply and was damning in his assessment of the FIA’s handling of the issue. “If you think of the steps we have taken as a sport and the more important issues and causes we need to be focused on, this is such a small thing,” he said. “It seems unnecessary for us to get into this spat. We have bigger fish to fry. I want to be an ally and I don’t want to fight over this, it’s very, very silly.” The row and the potential loss of F1’s most high-profile driver in the US is the last thing the sport wanted for their showcase in Miami. F1’s owners Liberty Media had made no secret of their desire to host races in “destination” cities, indeed to make every weekend have the sense of occasion of a Super Bowl. This weekend is surely the culmination of those ambitions. So eager were F1 to facilitate a race in the city and a second race in the US, they waived the usual race fee for the organisers, who in return are putting on the show F1 so badly wanted to showcase the sport. Hamilton’s potential pullout is a headache they had not anticipated having put together an impressive event thus far. The most practical test and the one that will be of most concern from a sporting perspective is the track itself, which has returned positive reactions. The temporary circuit, built in the shadow of the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium, gives every impression of being a permanent track and no repeat of the unloved soulless car park in Las Vegas of the early 80s. It feels like a real track, which is some achievement given it is largely built on the Dolphins’ parking lots. Perhaps regardless of what sort of race it delivers, it is impossible not to imagine F1 will consider the weekend a success, or will as long as Hamilton is in a car. It has sold out with 240,000 fans expected over three days and marketed very much as an upscale, exclusive event, at which European fans already used to big ticket prices would probably blanch, with a three day pass at $900. The emphasis is inevitably on the show, of course, and here its corollary, corporate hospitality, which is in evidence on a grand scale, McLaren have a guest stand the size of a small multi-storey car park. F1 then are selling their glamour event and really pushing the boat out in Miami. Almost literally in the case of the Marina section on the inside of turn seven. When holding the race in downtown Miami’s seafront proved unfeasible, the organisers instead brought South Beach to the Hard Rock. Yachts were winched into place and surrounded by painted vinyl “water” while at the opposite end of the track at turn 12 they have trucked in Miami’s pristine white sand to make an artificial beach. There is hype and there is hyperbole but even that feels curiously fitting for a meeting that is pitching itself as much as an entertainment experience as a race. Purists may shudder but F1 has grand ambitions in the US and Miami it seems is very much setting a benchmark for how the sport wants to go about breaking America.",Sport/Sport,Lewis Hamilton ready to miss F1 Miami GP over jewellery standoff,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/lewis-hamilton-ready-to-miss-f1-miami-gp-over-jewellery-standoff
5/7/2022,"Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett’s article emphasised the importance of respectful, individualised maternity care, including in the language used to address transgender people (The language of maternity is alive and well – so why not expand it to include trans parents, 5 May). This idea is entirely uncontroversial. What has become contentious, however, is whether terms like “women” and “mothers” should be used in a broader sense, including in health communication and policy or replaced with other words that do not reference the female sex. It is a well-established principle of communication that the sex of individuals should be made visible when relevant and should not be made visible when not. This ensures that sex-related needs and issues are not overlooked and sex stereotyping is avoided. As I and others outline in a recent paper in Frontiers in Global Women’s Health, when discussing inherently sexed processes like pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding, there are risks to desexing language. Avoiding “women” and “mothers” can decrease inclusivity by requiring use of technical, more difficult to understand language. For example, when “women” is replaced with “people with a cervix”, this aids misunderstanding, particularly for those with low literacy or learning difficulties, or who are non-English speakers. Alternative terms for “women” that refer to reproductive body parts or processes such as “uterus havers”, “birthers” or “menstruators” are recognised as dehumanising and so to be avoided. Communicating statistics when language is desexed is fraught, as the NHS discovered when it wrote about how “8 in 10 people” will get pregnant after having unprotected sex. When communications refer to “parents” rather than “mothers”, the uniqueness of the mother-newborn relationship can be more easily overlooked. Far from a moral panic, there are real implications to desexing language when referring to inherently sexed processes and states. Thoughtful, careful discussion and consideration on this subject is needed.Prof Jenny GambleCoventry University  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/7/2022,"Police have been strongly criticised for not prosecuting a white woman who hit a 12-year-old black boy on the forehead with a paddle so forcefully he needed hospital treatment for a deep cut. The woman was arrested following the incident at a riverside park near Bristol but three weeks later Avon and Somerset police informed the boy’s family that no further action was being taken because the woman claimed she acted in self-defence and felt “threatened”. Relatives of the boy, Antwon Forrest, who is autistic, and campaigners questioned why the woman clashed with Antwon rather than white friends he was with and are asking whether race played a part in the decision not to press charges. The force has since said it has initiated a review of the case. The boy’s father, Tyran Forrest, who is mixed race, said: “If it was me that had hit a white child, I would be in jail right now. I was devastated when I got the letter from the police saying they were taking no further action. I had to tell Antwon she was getting away with it.” Antwon’s head was so badly cut it had to be glued together and he has been left with scar tissue and a lump. His father said: “He was so upset. I’ve brought him up to be brave so he tried to take it on the chin. He’s trying to get on with his day to day life but he’s affected.” The incident took place at Conham River Park in south Gloucestershire on 26 March when Antwon met a group of friends on a warm day for a birthday party. Tyran Forrest, a builder and driver from Stockwood, south Bristol, claimed some of the children – but not Antwon – were throwing mudballs at passing boats including one being paddled by the woman, who works for a car dealership. “She had a go at them. My son told her to calm down.” What followed allegedly involved some pushing and shouting and ended up with Antwon being struck by the woman with a paddle, and, as Tyran Forrest said: “My son was standing there, blood pouring down his face.” Tyran Forrest was called and asked the woman what happened. He claimed that: “She said she had seen red and didn’t mean it.” The police arrived and arrested the woman. “They told me she had admitted it,” he said. Antwon gave a video interview explaining what had happened. Asked why he thought Antwon rather than his white friends had been hit, Tyran Forrest said: “It seems a bit suspicious that she went for him. People can look at it how they want.” On 14 April a letter arrived telling the family: “The case has been reviewed and unfortunately the decision has been made to take no further action.” It continued: “The main reason is that during interview the suspect raised a possibility for self-defence. By this we mean that the suspect admitted pushing Antwon and when pushing him she had the paddle in her hand and this contacted with his head. The suspect claimed she pushed Antwon away because he challenged her and she felt threatened by him and the surrounding group.” There was an outcry after Antwon’s family posted the image of his head wound and the letter on social media. Patricia Daley, of Black Protest Legal Support, had called for the police to look again at the case. The ex-boxer Ashley Theophane wrote that he was not surprised by the police response. In a statement, Avon and Somerset police said the incident was taken seriously and a woman was arrested and interviewed. It added: “A realistic prospect of a conviction was not made out from the available evidence following the investigation. Since becoming aware of the injured boy’s family’s concerns through social media, officers have been in touch with them and initiated a review. “This review will be carried out by an experienced detective sergeant, with oversight from a senior officer. It is being monitored by the office of the police and crime commissioner and the intention is to identify appropriate independent scrutiny so that our communities can have confidence in the outcome.” The Guardian attempted to contact the woman through her workplace but received no reply.",News/UK news,UK police criticised for not prosecuting woman who hit black boy with paddle ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/uk-police-criticised-not-prosecuting-woman-hit-black-boy-antwon-forrest-with-paddle
5/7/2022,"In marginal Croydon, a group of weary Conservative activists were trying to drum up voters in the London council elections in the dying hours of polling day when they bumped into a group of Labour campaigners, who said: “We’ve sent our thank-you letters to Boris.” On the other side of the capital, a few hours later, as the counting got under way, a Labour candidate in a no-hope area was woken in the middle of the night and sped urgently to the count in a taxi when unexpected victory loomed. “Not a shred of work was done in the ward,” a Labour insider admitted of the shock result in Hampstead Town, which has never before returned a Labour councillor. Across London, Labour turfed out the Conservatives in strongholds Wandsworth, Westminster and Barnet, while the Tories failed to make hoped-for inroads in Sutton. The result was described as “catastrophic” by Gavin Barwell, a former London Tory MP and chief of staff to Theresa May. “I don’t really think that – even privately – the most ardent Labourite would argue Wandsworth and Westminster were failing councils. Voters clearly felt they were efficient,” he said. “They were held in 1990 through the poll tax row, in 1994 during the depth of John Major’s unpopularity, in 2014 all through the austerity agenda, in 2018 despite the Brexit turmoil. They withstood all those moments when the Conservative party was struggling. “It should be – but I don’t know if it will be – a massive wake-up call.” Tory campaigners in the flagship two seats, which boasted the country’s lowest council tax, had been nervous in the run-up to polling day. Some badged themselves as “local Conservatives” and told frustrated voters that “it isn’t Boris [Johnson] on the ballot paper” as they grappled to dissuade disaffected members from staying at home or switching party. But their efforts were not enough, in part, some believe, because the prime minister’s “levelling up” agenda had alienated some outside the northern “red wall”. Justine Greening, a former cabinet minister and ex-Tory MP for Putney, said: “I just feel that this sense of constantly saying to people in London and the south-east that their lives are fine makes people think: ‘Why would I bother voting for you?’” Greening conceded that “some people saw the Conservatives in government as the problem,” but said: “They don’t yet see Labour as the solution.” While some results were undoubtedly driven by local issues – low traffic neighbourhoods, council tax and the quality of services provided – Labour will view its gains as having symbolic importance, coming at roughly midway through the government’s administration. Winning Barnet, which has a large Jewish population, was viewed as a significant endorsement of Keir Starmer’s pledge to stamp out antisemitism in Labour. Local party figures also credited their campaign to improve the council, but admitted the current Labour leadership had really just “restored things to their natural order”. In 2018, canvassers recounted tearful conversations with Jewish voters, but this time many reported that those same people now felt able to back Labour. But one activist admitted there was still some distrust: “Sadly we’ve got ‘long Corbyn’ – in the Jewish community more so than any other community.” Campaigners hope that by fielding more Jewish candidates – including a rabbi in Haringey – they will be able to win over those still unconvinced at the next general election. Ben Trow, an actor in Barnet, said he was a lifelong Green party supporter but voted tactically for the first time in his life: “For the first time, I saw that Labour really had a chance of winning this area, and I had to go for that.” Tass Czechowski, who is retired and lives in the same borough, said: “This government is a disaster, from potholes in the road to Partygate in Downing Street. It’s a shame to punish local councillors over what’s happening in the House of Commons, but this lot are so appalling that we just have to try to get them out through any and every means we have.” In formerly true blue Westminster council, the Marble Arch mound played a significant part in Labour’s victory – with the Tories’ careful public spending promises countered with arguments that the £6m cost was a waste of taxpayers’ money. Jacqui Gough, a former flight attendant, said: “Locally, the Conservatives have been quite good – they’ve cleaned up the canal and the rates have been very reasonable. I was thinking this morning that I bet they will go up, but we can afford to pay. And we should spend more on services.” Across the river in Wandsworth, events planner Lucy Tetley said she backed the Tories locally for having “always done a great job keeping our council tax low”. She blamed Johnson for the party losing Wandsworth, saying: “I think it’s a great shame. I think people have let anger about Boris Johnson and Covid cloud their judgment.” Labour’s successes are also partly due to the city’s changing demographic. “The results in London are the end of a 30-year drift rather than an overnight collapse,” said Will Tanner, a director of thinktank Onward and former adviser to Theresa May. He added: “The Conservatives have fallen back there at successive elections since the mid-2000s, and have never held a smaller share of London constituencies while being in government than they do now. “So while of course it matters that citadels of low tax conservatism like Wandsworth and Westminster are no longer blue, it isn’t a shock, and the more material results are outside the capital.” The wins for Labour in Southampton and Cumberland have bolstered some party members’ hopes, but a failure to inflict more damaging defeats in the “red wall” and Midlands may encourage Tory MPs not to depose Johnson, given that it remains unclear if he is as much of an electoral liability outside London. A Tory MP in the home counties dismissed the Conservatives’ losses in London, saying the capital was “an electoral bubble that wasn’t with us when we won an 80[-seat] majority. The rest of the country is the barometer on where we really stand, not London.” But for Barwell, the areas lost in London still present a threat to the parliamentary seats in them held by Conservative MPs there. “They are part of the Commons majority of 80 that, if you carry on this way, are going to become more vulnerable,” he said. “Everyone tries to pretend London is different. But if the party is struggling in London, there are going to be other places in the country it will struggle too.”",News/Politics,How Boris Johnson’s Conservatives lost their grip on London,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/boris-johnson-conservatives-lost-grip-on-london
5/7/2022,"Mark Rylance’s stance on the inequalities of drama and theatre provision in UK schools needs to be aired more widely (Mark Rylance calls out Tory arts cuts in new Jerusalem programme, 29 April). Why, when the nation is concerned about the wellbeing and social health of children and young people, does drama and theatre continue to be marginalised? Drama enables children to explore issues of global concern, to develop new perspectives and acquire essential communication skills. Drama is a social art form that is informed by the interests of the participants. It is a collaborative learning experience that is sadly missing from the curriculum of many schools. It has been evident for many years that youngsters thrive in schools where drama is accessible to all. Drama should have the same curriculum status as art and music, and all children should have the opportunity to experience live theatre. Rylance asks: “If, in modern day England, an institution like Eton deems drama important enough to have two theatres, why are we allowing the government to cut arts education from the life of the rest of our young people?” His question is one that should be addressed urgently by educationists, arts bodies and politicians alike.Dr Geoff ReadmanChair, National Drama  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/7/2022,"Police in Canada are trying to identify a young Black girl whose body was found in a Toronto dumpster, a grim discovery that has shaken the city and seasoned investigators looking into the case. The Toronto police service announced on Thursday that the body, discovered on Monday in an affluent neighbourhood, was that of a young Black girl, believed to be between the ages of four and seven. Homicide investigators have been assigned to the case and are cross-referencing descriptions of the child with missing persons cases across the country, but acknowledge the child might not have been reported missing. “Our first priority now is to establish the identity of this little girl. The investigators will leave no stone unturned,” Insp Hank Idsinga told reporters. “Kids don’t just die.” A postmortem was conducted on Wednesday but police have not yet determined cause of death. Police say the level of decomposition suggests the girl could have died as long ago as last summer. Officers were called to a residential construction site in Rosedale, one of the city’s most affluent neighbourhoods, on Monday. Officers found the girl’s body wrapped in a crocheted blanket inside a plastic bag, which was also wrapped in a blanket. Police said the girl was of African or mixed African descent, was three and a half feet tall and had a slight build. She had four short ponytails, two of which were braided and tied with blue and black elastics. Investigators believe her body was left at the construction site between 28 April and 2 May, a location near to a highway and a close to an apartment building. While there are no cameras directly facing the dumpster, police have started collecting video from the surrounding area. Toronto’s mayor, John Tory, called the discovery an “unspeakable tragedy” and called on anyone who might recognize the blankets or know of a girl matching the police description to come forward. Residents had already turned the front of the property into an impromptu memorial for the child. Some had placed flowers, another a card that read “Little one, we pray heaven has dried your tears.” Idsinga said investigators would not stop until they have answers. “We will get to the bottom of it, no matter what it takes.”",News/World news,Body of a Black girl found in dumpster in affluent Toronto neighbourhood,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/body-black-girl-found-dumpster-toronto
5/7/2022,"In the course of more than two decades’ imprisonment in New York, Kathy Boudin, who has died aged 78 from cancer, underwent a profound transformation, from political revolutionary involved in a robbery that caused three deaths to penal reformer acting as an advocate for women in prison, and in particular for reunification with their children. She came to realise that she needed to recover her own sense of responsibility and self, free from any sense of political justification. This process became a path to seeking restorative justice – bringing people harmed by crime into contact with those responsible for it, to find a way forward – and eventually, clemency, parole and release from prison in 2003. The decisions that she came to regret came out of a passion for justice – against racism in the US, by demonstrating in favour of civil rights, and against imperialism abroad, as represented by the Vietnam war. In March 1970 she and other members of the Weather Underground, a breakaway group from Students for a Democratic Society, were in a house in West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, when three of the group were killed by the explosion of bombs that were being constructed, believed to be intended for an anti-war protest at a military base. Kathy and another SDS militant, Cathlyn Wilkerson, who were in another part of the house, survived and fled the scene. In the following years Kathy maintained a low profile while a fugitive from the FBI and continuing as an activist; the Vietnam war ended in 1975. She appeared on the front pages again in October 1981 when she was involved in the robbery of a Brink’s truck in Nyack, New York state, by acting as a decoy in a getaway truck. The motive was political, on behalf of the Black Liberation Army group, and the value Kathy and her partner, David Gilbert, gave to the operation lay in being white when the police would be looking for the black men who committed the robbery. A Brink’s guard was shot dead during the holdup a mile away from their waiting truck. Later, close to that vehicle changeover point, police stopped the truck David was driving and, although Kathy got out of the passenger seat and surrendered, the men in the back jumped out and shot two policemen. Up to that point I had not known Kathy, but I was a friend of her parents, Jean (nee Roisman), a poet, and Leonard Boudin, a leading liberties lawyer, who had mentored me in my early years as a barrister. In 1982 Leonard asked me to help Kathy with a defence strategy, and two years later she pleaded guilty to first-degree robbery and, with regard to the death of the security guard, second-degree murder. Her plea was accepted and she was sentenced to 21 years to life in prison. David and the others did not recognise the court and were sentenced to 75 years. Kathy entered the Bedford Hills correctional facility, a maximum security prison for women, with deep regrets and remorse for her participation in Brink’s, and serious questions about the role of violence in political movements. She also had to live with the consequences her political choices had for her son, Chesa, whom she had had with David; at the time of the robbery, he was 14 months old. Every year for 22 years I visited Kathy and saw how she changed. In prison, she focused on strengthening mother-child relationships across the separation of incarceration, working to bring up Chesa collectively with David, her former Weather colleagues Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers, and their two sons. In 1989 I made a documentary with Polly Bide for Thames Television about the innovative parenting scheme at Bedford Hills. After the Pell grants scheme to give prison inmates a college education was abolished in 1994, Kathy raised funds from private donors for classes to resume three years later. She also promoted a community response to the HIV/Aids epidemic, and edited and co-authored the book Breaking the Walls of Silence: Aids and Women in a New York State Maximum Security Prison (1998). After her release in 2003, for which Chesa and many of us had campaigned, Kathy developed a restorative justice programme inside prisons for long-termers, many of whom were sentenced as juveniles; she created policy initiatives to release ageing people from prison and to reform the parole system, and initiated a healthcare programme for people returning from incarceration. In 2014 she founded, with Cheryl Wilkins and Geraldine Downey, the Center for Justice at Columbia University, New York. Her work focused on the causes and consequences of mass incarceration, and the development of strategies to both transform the current criminal justice system and to deal with the day-to-day damage that the system has caused. Born in Manhattan, Kathy had enjoyed a privileged upbringing. The family’s house in Greenwich Village was the centre of liberal, radical and artistic circles. Her father acted for Paul Robeson and many other celebrated activists, including Daniel Ellsberg of the Pentagon Papers trial fame. Childhood friends from the Little Red Schoolhouse included the future activist Angela Davis. From Elisabeth Irwin high school Kathy went to Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, where she majored in Russian studies for her bachelor’s degree (1965); she visited both Moscow and Cuba. Later on, while in prison, she got a master’s degree in adult education and literacy from Norwich University, Vermont, and in 2007 a doctorate from Columbia University Teachers College. The spirit of the 1960s galvanised Kathy’s passion for justice and set the course for the rest of her life. From her engagement with the early days of the civil rights movement in the Cleveland-based ERAP – Economic Research and Action Project, a multiracial movement of poor people, founded by the social and political activist Tom Hayden and others – to her aligning with the anti-war Weather Underground later in the decade, Kathy threw her lot in with those most oppressed. The Weather Underground name came from the faction’s original name, Weatherman, after a 1965 Bob Dylan lyric: “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.” Kathy was wholehearted in following that wind, for better or for worse. She was an extraordinary, compassionate human being who became very close to me and my children, joining us for holidays on Cape Cod each year after her release. She turned her grave mistakes into an engine for change and public good. Last year she was reunited with David, after he was given parole. Chesa became a district attorney in San Francisco, and Kathy’s elder brother Michael was a federal judge. The three survive her, along with a grandson.

5/7/2022,"Wheat production in Ukraine is likely to be at least a third lower than in normal years, according to analysis of satellite images of the country. Ukraine is one of the world’s major exporters of wheat, but the war is taking a toll on the country’s agriculture and food supplies, sparking fears of shortages or higher prices around the world. Last year, Ukraine produced about 33m tonnes of wheat, of which it exported about 20m tonnes, making it the sixth-largest exporter globally. This year, according to analysis published on Friday by the satellite company Kayrros, the country has the potential to produce only about 21m tonnes of wheat, down about 23% on the average of the previous five years. As more disruption from the war is extremely likely, with fighting concentrated in the east where major wheat-growing regions are found, Kayrros estimates that the country’s wheat harvest is likely to be down by about 35% this year. Ukraine has already moved to ban exports of grain and many other food products, in an effort to preserve its own food supplies. Transport is also difficult, with Russia blockading the country’s Black Sea coast. Global wheat prices leapt by 20% in March, owing to the direct impacts of the war on wheat production, and the impacts of higher energy prices and fertiliser prices around the world. These were already rising before Russia’s invasion and have been sent soaring further by the impact of the war, as countries have moved to cut imports of oil and gas from Russia. While prices have since slipped back slightly from their record highs, analysts at Rabobank predict they could rise again due to the war in Ukraine, where it is predicting production could fall by slightly more than 20%, as well as sanctions on Russia and dry and hot conditions in other wheat-producing nations including the US and India. Carlos Mera, an analyst at Rabobank, said prices would remain high as it was unlikely major global producers would be able to increase production significantly, because of high fertiliser prices and pressure to grow other crops where prices were also rising. Russia and Ukraine are also major producers of fertiliser, which has further raised input prices for farmers. He added: “It is not just a question of how much wheat Ukraine will harvest but how much it will manage to export. Normally 90% of grain exports flow through ports into the Black Sea but we are not going to see that [because of Russian military action].” He said exports via train had also been affected by attacks on railway lines. Food price rises are now a serious cause of concern around the world. People on low incomes in developing countries were already facing problems because the pandemic had depleted their resources, while conflict has led to countries such as Yemen and Afghanistan teetering on the brink of famine. The climate crisis is also taking a toll. In recent weeks, a heatwave in south Asia has left millions of people facing heat stress. The heat is likely to reduce crop yields, and could affect India’s wheat harvest. Last year, heatwaves in Canada disrupted its wheat-growing and led to higher prices for pasta. Australia, another major wheat producer, has had heavy flooding this year. In the UK, food prices have also been raised by Brexit, which has added about 4% to inflation, according to the London School of Economics. Much of Ukraine’s wheat went to the Middle East, forcing countries there to be even more dependent on Russia for grain supplies. Egypt, for instance, which will host the next UN climate summit, Cop27, this November, is reliant on Ukraine and Russia for about 80% of its wheat. Kayrros uses AI combined with data from satellites to monitor commodities, biomass and other environmental concerns such as methane. Antoine Halff, its co-founder, said: “Monitoring geopolitical events in near real-time is critical to understanding them and mitigating their impacts. The impacts of the terrible war in Ukraine can sadly be seen from space, and this data illustrates the spectre of rising food prices and hunger the world faces as a consequence of this conflict.”",News/World news,"Ukraine’s wheat harvest may fall by 35%, satellite images suggest",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/ukraine-wheat-harvest-may-fall-by-35-percent-satellite-images-suggest
5/7/2022,"John Yems has left his role as manager of Crawley Town after he was alleged to have engaged in racist behaviour at the club. Yems was suspended indefinitely by the League Two side after the accusations came to light a fortnight ago. The Football Association this week confirmed it was investigating the 62-year-old and on Friday the club announced his departure. Crawley said in a statement they had “mutually agreed to part ways with John Yems, effective immediately” and added: “Crawley Town FC will immediately begin a global search for its next manager.” Yems had been manager of Crawley since 2019 and as many as seven members of the Crawley squad are reported to have made claims against him to the Professional Footballers’ Association. The PFA is understood to be offering counselling to these players. The allegations, which were first reported by the Daily Mail and have not been independently corroborated by the Guardian, include reports that Yems:  Referred to players of Asian heritage within the squad as “terrorists, suicide bombers and curry munchers”.  Created a racially segregated dressing room, with white players told “don’t change in the black boys’ room”.  Made racial slurs about black players and players of Asian heritage. Yems has not commented publicly on the claims but is believed to deny them. Crawley complete their league season away to Oldham on Saturday and came under new ownership last month. The club was bought by WAGMI United, an American consortium of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. Speaking on Friday one of the new owners, Preston Johnson, said the club hoped to move on. “We’re looking forward to the next era of Crawley Town Football Club,” Johnson said. “We have an opportunity to build on more than 125 years of rich history and take this club to the next level. We’re eager to partner with our players and supporters as we build a team and community that Red Devils fans can continue to be proud of – both on and off the pitch.”",Sport/Football,John Yems leaves Crawley Town after allegations of racist behaviour,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/john-yems-leaves-crawley-town-after-allegations-of-racist-behaviour
5/7/2022,"Emma Hayes has said she is pleased Chelsea remained competitive this season despite having a squad in transition as she prepared for the Women’s Super League title to be decided on Sunday. “We’re in a healthy place,” said the manager, who will say goodbye to the long-serving Ji So-yun, Jonna Andersson and Drew Spence at the end of the campaign. “I think we had an ageing squad, we’ve had to try and address that balance and to compete while you’re transitioning. That’s really tough. As a coach it’s why I’m pleased we’re in the position to compete, because that’s the hardest thing to do, trust me, when you’re transitioning ages.” Chelsea are one point clear of Arsenal going into the final day of the season and will win a third consecutive title if their result at home to Manchester United is not bettered by Arsenal, who play at West Ham. The journey has not been easy for Hayes amid injuries, key absences during the Asia Cup and ongoing worries about the fatigue suffered by the England forward Fran Kirby. “I would say [the bonds are deeper and stronger as a result],” said Hayes. “Man City had trouble at the beginning part of the year and they struggled. We lost Magda Eriksson for three months, Pernille Harder for large chunks, the girls at the Asian Cup for large chunks, Melanie Leupolz, Maren Mjelde. We expected Maren to be back last August, we’d planned for Maren to be back – huge losses. My question is how many top teams would have coped with that and still be there?” If there is pressure going into the final day, then an FA Cup final against City the following Sunday, Hayes says she is not feeling it. “I’m from a council estate. Trust me, pressure was putting money on the table to pay the bill; this is not pressure. Look at the cost of inflation, look at the rising costs for people paying the bills. “This is far from pressure; this is a joy, I love my job. I enjoy the situation but more importantly I enjoy representing a club that I absolutely adore and to be in a position where we can continue to win on behalf of Chelsea is something I think I was born for.”",Sport/Football,WSL season finale: Hayes relaxed as Chelsea bid to hold off Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/06/chelsea-emma-hayes-wsl-season-finale-arsenal-jonas-eidevall
5/7/2022,"Thursday’s local elections were seen as a test of voters’ mood after Partygate and as the cost of living crisis bites. Here are some of the things we learned. Conservative MPs have repeatedly found reasons to prevaricate rather than take action against their beleaguered leader for breaking Covid rules. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, some were taking comfort on Friday in the idea that Labour appeared to have made only limited advances into the “red wall” – and that the most catastrophic outcomes had been avoided (though suggestions of 800 or more lost seats always appeared outlandish). But these results are unlikely to have discouraged anyone plotting a coup. Labour won the popular vote, with the BBC’s projected national vote share putting the party on 35% to the Conservatives’ 30% – Labour’s best performance on this measure for a decade. The Liberal Democrats are breathing down Tory MPs’ necks across the south, from Jacob Rees-Mogg’s patch in Somerset to Dominic Raab’s in Surrey. And Labour looks likely to push the Conservatives into third place in Scotland, underlining fears that Johnson has become an electoral liability. Upcoming byelections in Tiverton and Honiton and in Wakefield may provide further evidence of that. The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden compared Keir Starmer’s performance in Thursday’s local elections unfavourably with that of Tony Blair in 1995, two years before he swept into Downing Street, when Labour gained 1,800 council seats. But there are other routes to power for Labour than a 1997-style landslide. The Lib Dems’ gains across the south, from Somerset to West Oxfordshire to Raab’s back yard of Elmbridge in Surrey, suggest the Conservatives could lose a swath of MPs outside Johnson’s stomping ground of the red wall to Ed Davey’s party. Combined with Labour gains in the red wall and a recovery in Scotland, that could be enough to deprive Johnson of his majority – though it would open up complex questions of what deal he might be prepared to strike with the Scottish National party, the Lib Dems, or both. Clinching Westminster, Wandsworth and Barnet puts Labour close to a clean sweep of the capital’s boroughs, despite the Conservatives being led by a man who was once the city’s mayor. Gloomy Tory MPs bemoaned the fact there are Conservative seats in Barnet and Westminster that now appear at risk, and questioned why their party was not able to continue to appeal to longtime supporters. Ravi Govindia, the outgoing leader of Wandsworth council, offered his answer, saying “other events” had clouded voters’ judgment, and many had raised “the issue of Boris Johnson”. Like the Lib Dems, the Green party in England had an unambiguously good night, albeit from a much lower base. By 4pm it had 78 councillors, up from 36 before polling day, and many of these were in places it had not previously been strong, including South Tyneside and Plymouth. Unlike in Scotland, where elections are fought under proportional representation and the Greens have joined the SNP in government, the English party’s strong showing is unlikely to presage a sudden rush of Green MPs to join Caroline Lucas in Westminster. But it has demonstrated its appeal well beyond its traditional strongholds of Brighton and Bristol, perhaps becoming what the elections expert Paula Surridge calls a “none of the above” party for voters exasperated with the status quo. Beccy Cooper, now the Labour leader of Worthing council after the party took control there in Thursday’s poll, has used the phrase “blue sea wall” to describe a string of places along the south coast – including Worthing, but also Southampton and potentially even true-blue Bournemouth – where political change appears to be afoot. Labour took control of Southampton council on Friday as well as Worthing, where demographic change making the town younger and more gentrified has helped Labour on its way. Alan Wager, of King’s College London, wrote before polling day: “We have emerging what looks to be a very wall-like set of places: a Plymouth-Bournemouth-Southampton-Portsmouth-Worthing axis running along the south coast where the Conservative party has reason to fear Labour.” There aren’t enough seats here to compensate for the loss of the party’s northern heartlands, but every little helps.",News/Politics,From ‘red wall’ to ‘sea wall’: five things we learned from the local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/local-elections-things-we-learned-labour-lib-dems-greens-red-wall-sea-wall
5/7/2022,"Few cities are as synonymous with New Labour as Hull. The city has elected only Labour MPs since the 1960s, including John Prescott, who hulked over Kingston upon Hull East for 40 years, and Alan Johnson, who divided his time between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s cabinets and the Hessle Road. On Thursday night, however, Labour was delivered a bloody nose by the Liberal Democrats, who took control of Hull city council on a promising night for England’s third party. Twelve years after the Lib Dems alienated much of the electorate by going into coalition with the Conservatives, they now appear sufficiently detoxified to cause major headaches for Labour and the Tories alike. Celebrating dozens of gains, including pushing David’s Cameron’s local council in West Oxfordshire into no overall control and overtaking Labour as the biggest party in Stockport, the Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, was cock-a-hoop. “What began as a tremor in Chesham and Amersham [and] became an earthquake in North Shropshire is now an almighty shockwave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down,” he said, referencing the party’s recent byelection victories. The party was heading towards a net gain of 80 seats on Friday afternoon. Davey started the day with a speech in Wimbledon, south-west London, where his party took 12 seats on the local council, Merton, mainly from the Tories. “The tectonic plates of British politics are shifting beneath Boris Johnson’s feet,” he said, before rushing to Somerset, where the Lib Dems had taken control of the local council from the Conservatives. A series of other gains saw the party erode support from the Tories in “blue wall” commuter-belt areas, including Woking and Elmbridge, both in Surrey. In the latter, the Lib Dems made gains in the constituency of the justice secretary, Dominic Raab. In Hull, what was overlooked amid all the talk of yellow fever was the fact that the Lib Dems ran the East Yorkshire city in the not too distant past. There is a framed newspaper headline in the office of the Liberal Democrat group at Hull’s Guildhall, which commemorates their big achievement last time they were in control, from 2007 to 2011. “Council not the worst in the country,” reported the Hull Daily Mail a few years into the party’s last reign, when Hull moved slightly up the Audit Commission’s table of best- and worst-performing local authorities. The Lib Dems are typically happy about celebrating a marginal gain. No achievement is too minor to be memorialised in a leaflet: every pothole filled, every drop kerb delivered, each planning application defeated. “They’re excellent campaigners,” conceded the Labour MP Karl Turner, who took over from Prescott in Kingston upon Hull East in 2010. “They take credit for everything. If I went outside my house now and picked up some dog poo with a shovel, you can be sure that the next day they’ll put out a leaflet saying, ‘Lib Dems delivering: we are getting dog poo picked up.’” Hull is home to the Liberal Democrats’ national campaign chief, Dave McCobb, who held his council seat on Thursday night. The new leader of Hull city council, Michael Ross, said McCobb was “very good at reading the electorate in terms of what’s happening and the mood, and he just gets what’s going on”. Turner thinks Labour was “not vicious enough” in campaigning against the Lib Dems in Hull. “We should have been hammering home to voters that the Lib Dems signed off the 55% cuts to Hull city council that we are still suffering today.” But Ross, who was first elected as a Liberal Democrat councillor as a 21-year-old Hull University student in 2002, thinks voters have forgiven the party for the sins of the coalition period. “It’s been a while since tuition fees have come up on the doorstep,” he said. Turner chalks up the Lib Dem victory in Hull to widely despised roadworks that have caused gridlock across the city for months; the introduction of cycle lanes and bus lanes during the pandemic, which have taken further space away from frustrated motorists; and unpopular plans to build hundreds of new houses. Ross agrees those issues were important during the campaign, but he rejected the idea of his party as opportunistic goalhangers. “We won through a combination of people feeling disgusted and let down by the Conservative government and fed up with the local Labour council,” he said. The win was the culmination of 11 years of hard graft, he said. “In 2011 we lost 10 out of 12 wards we were defending. Nationally, we took a kicking. But while in some places the party withered away on the vine, we were determined not to let that happen.” Turner nearly lost to the Conservatives in 2019, scraping though with a majority of 1,239. He takes heart from what he sees as the collapse of the Tory vote in Hull, which led to the party losing its sole councillor. However, he cannot just rely on an unpopular government if he is to win in the next general election. Enthusiasm for Keir Starmer’s Labour party is hard to discern on Humberside. “All Starmer does is criticise the government. He’s got nothing to offer the country,” said Stuart Ramsay, 68, a retired mechanical fitter and shop steward who described his politics as “slightly to the left of the middle of the road”. He said: “As a trade unionist all my life, I learned that you cannot go into a meeting and just complain. You have to have something to offer. I think Boris Johnson is like Winston Churchill was in world war two – he’s the best of a bad lot. If Angela Rayner was the leader, the Labour party might be in a better place. She seems to have a better grip on things.”",News/Politics,Lib Dems welcome signs of resurgence on night of local election gains,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/lib-dems-local-elections-hull-city-council
