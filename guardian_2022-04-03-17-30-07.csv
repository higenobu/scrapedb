4/3/2022,"The removal of free Covid tests is an “anti-business” measure that risks hitting the economy as it faces spiralling costs and uncertainty, ministers have been warned. Some workplaces are already seeing teams hit hard by Covid absences, after the number of infections reached its highest level on record last week. Official data suggests almost 5 million people have the disease, or one in 13 of the population. It comes with businesses already facing spiralling costs, as well as higher national insurance payments from this month. Employees are also being faced with a decision over when to test. There are now concerns that the withdrawal of free Covid tests for most people in England last Friday will lead to high levels of absences that could be avoided, causing more disruption of businesses already struggling. There are pleas for a rethink, with concerns that smaller businesses, as well as hospitality, could be heavily affected. “The Westminster government needs to understand that we are still living through Covid rather than with it, and change their approach to again provide tests free of charge,” said Dan Shears, the GMB union’s health and safety officer. “The cost of providing tests will likely be dwarfed by the productivity cost of millions of preventable infections.” Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said that the government had created a “perfect storm” for the economy and workers. “Ending free Covid tests in the middle of a cost of living crisis is terrible for family budgets and for public health,” she said. “With cases soaring again, the last thing workers should be worrying about is how they are going to afford tests. But that’s the position many frontline and low-paid staff have been put in.” Some unions are now calling on employers to help bear the costs of testing, as they would benefit from the lower absences. “It isn’t appropriate for workers to bear the cost of Covid testing to be able to go to work each day,” said Shears. “Workers do not buy their own PPE, and they should not buy their own tests.” Senior NHS figures are concerned that the lower Covid hospitalisation rate is creating complacency. Some health figures said they were seeing their most difficult period of the pandemic, while hospital cases in some areas were still weeks away from peaking. Scientists expect infections from the Omicron coronavirus variant known as BA.2 to fall by the end of this month. “There’s clearly lots of other things going on – I think that is lulling the public into a bit of a false sense of security,” said Dr Layla McCay, director of policy at NHS Confederation. “Thanks to vaccines, people with Omicron are less likely to need hospital care but a small proportion always will. A small proportion of a giant number is still a pretty big number, and lots of our members are seeing it rising still. “In previous waves of Covid, there’s been a national appreciation of the challenge the NHS is currently encountering and mitigations have been taken. Right now, the NHS is in a confusing scenario where they know they are under huge pressure due to Covid but they’re also being expected to deliver on recovery plans, when they might not necessarily feel they’re at that stage.” The Lib Dems calculated that pub owners, already struggling through the pandemic and facing rising costs including the return of a 20% VAT rate, could face a bill for £4,000 a year to provide testing for their staff should they choose to do so. “The decision to scrap free tests is anti-business,” said Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem health spokesperson. “This government has lost touch with the harsh reality faced by business owners who just want to stay safe and stay open. Yet again, small businesses are being shafted by this government’s nonsensical Covid policies.” Meanwhile, teachers warned that free tests were being axed and self-isolation rules relaxed in a way that was confusing and mis-timed. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Children who are ‘unwell and have a high temperature’ should stay at home until they no longer have a high temperature. “Adults who do test positive are being advised to ‘try to stay at home’ for five days, and children for three. This confusing guidance is a recipe for even more chaos and will make managing cases and preventing disruption of pupils’ education even harder than it already is.” Health department officials pointed out that the testing, tracing and isolation budget had cost more than £15.7bn in 2021-22. They said the population’s protection from Covid was now high enough to reduce the costs, as a result of vaccinations.",News/World news,End of free Covid testing risks creating ‘a perfect storm’ for UK economy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/end-of-free-covid-testing-risks-creating-a-perfect-storm-for-uk-economy
4/3/2022,"In its 20 years of existence, Ballet Black has commissioned more than 50 ballets by 37 different choreographers. So it was only to be expected that it would mark its anniversary with a double bill of new work. The first, Say It Loud, is a lively tribute to what the company has achieved down the years, loosely shaped in seven chapters by artistic director Cassa Pancho to a varied soundtrack by Michael “Mikey J” Asante that takes in everything from Steve Reich to Lord Kitchener and Etta James. There are words in there too; a reminder of the prejudice and opposition the company has faced from liberals – “Shouldn’t you be making works about slavery?” – as well as the purely racist. Its structure lets the dancers shine; so much of the appeal of this company lies in the talent it has allowed to blossom. These are individuals who you want to watch. This saves the second piece, Black Sun, by the South African choreographer Gregory Maqoma, which claims to be about standing together against human degradation but felt totally baffling. At the Royal Opera House, a triple bill containing a new work by Kyle Abraham (alongside revivals of the dramatic Solo Echo by Crystal Pite and Christopher Wheeldon’s still gleaming DGV) arrived to break the monotony of endless Swan Lakes. The Weathering reveals the American’s idiosyncratic ability to create beautiful movement that shifts between the formal and the casual as he marshals his 11 dancers (two women, nine men) in fluid patterns. Imbued with a sense of loss and longing, partly thanks to Dan Scully’s Chinese lantern lighting, it plays on the contrasts between very rapid turns and jumps and slow unfoldings. A duet for Calvin Richardson and Joseph Sissens, where they lean into each other catches the eye; so do the busy, bluesy twists of arms and legs that give shape and texture to the steps. Fumi Kaneko has a solo where her long arms and limbs seem to scrape the air; Anna Rose O’Sullivan turns like a top into the wings. The entire cast looks wonderful.

4/3/2022,"Shortly after 4pm last Friday, dozens of staff at Brasserie Zédel, close by London’s Piccadilly Circus, gathered in the Crazy Coqs, the glorious art deco cabaret room opposite the restaurant. There, they were addressed by Dillip Rajakarier, CEO of Minor International. Overnight, the vast Thai hotel and restaurant group had won a bidding war to take control of Zédel’s parent company, which also owns landmark London restaurants including the Wolseley, Delaunay and Colbert. He was now the boss. “He got it wrong from the start,” says one person who was present. “He kept referring to us as a brand. We’ve never thought of ourselves as a brand.” The meeting became increasingly fractious. “He told us that founders come and go,” says another. “That was when he completely lost us.” Similar town hall meetings planned for the other restaurants were swiftly cancelled. It seemed that Rajakarier had underestimated the loyalty of the staff to those founders, Chris Corbin and Jeremy King. While Corbin had taken a step back in recent years, King, regarded by many in the hospitality business as the capital’s leading restaurateur, remained very much hands on. He’s famed for his eye for detail and for his daily tours of his restaurant dining rooms, for stopping by the tables of regulars and newcomers alike to check they were being looked after. The difference between a restaurant owner and a restaurateur, he said once, is that one runs it from the boardroom and one runs it from the floor. King was always on the floor. Now he was out, banned from even entering any of the nine restaurants he had created. It was the dismal end to a fractious battle which began in 2017, when Corbin and King sold a majority shareholding in the business to Minor International to fund expansion. Commercial disagreements led Minor to force the company into administration, even though all the restaurants were trading profitably. In the early hours of Friday morning, the administrators held an auction during which King, backed by American investors, attempted to buy back his company. But Minor won, purchasing the remaining 24% of Corbin & King for a sum reportedly north of £60m. “I no longer have any equity in the business,” King told colleagues in a subsequent email. That morning every one of the restaurants posted a monochrome image of the two founders to their individual Instagram accounts with the caption: “THIS is Corbin & King.” Leading figures in the restaurant business expressed their dismay across social media. Stephen Fry tweeted: “Oh bollocks. Is it always going to be a world where the good guys lose and the greedy, soulless and mean win out?” In the midst of a cost of living crisis, when energy prices are going through the roof, a boardroom battle over a bunch of apparently fancy restaurants, with menus full of steak tartare and îles flottantes, may seem less than important. But what has happened to the much-loved group led by the Wolseley, on London’s Piccadilly, speaks to a faceless corporatisation of hospitality which has little to do with being hospitable and everything to do with profit above all else. Corbin and King met in the late 1970s when they were respectively running front of house at London brasseries Langan’s and Joe Allen. Together they bought the Caprice and turned it into a sure-fire hit, with a starry clientele. It became the cornerstone of an empire famed for its service, which included The Ivy. Since they sold that group in the late 1990s, it has gone through various owners and is now in the hands of businessman Richard Caring. In a foreshadowing of last week’s events, he has turned The Ivy name into a grim brand, shedding the talented staff who made the original restaurant what it was and cutting costs. But at least there was still the Wolseley, which Corbin & King opened in 2003. It was a Mittel European style restaurant with a menu of high-class comfort food, famed not just for its wiener schnitzel or Viennese cakes but also for the way it made customers feel. The artist Lucian Freud went so often that when he died they laid his regular corner table with a black tablecloth and left it clear all night. Then came the Delaunay, a favourite of actors including Eileen Atkins and Derek Jacobi, followed by Zédel, a vast gilded homage to the great Parisian brasseries, with its menu priced for the masses. At opening the soup de jour was just £2.25. Here, I should declare an interest: my jazz ensemble has had a monthly residency at Zédel for years. Hence I’ve become a freelance employee. I have learned that, while the company may have around 1,000 staff, they genuinely regard themselves as a kind of family led by King. He has promoted enlightened recruitment policies, including flexible working hours for parents of young children and an emphasis on older staff. On Friday evening the Wolseley’s tables were full, the great vaulted dining room clattering with chatter. The always-reliable food was flying out of the kitchens. My wiener Holstein, a schnitzel with capers and anchovies, was on point. The staff on the floor were doing their job as impeccably as ever. But quietly they admitted it had been a traumatic day. “I’ve given a quarter of my life to this company,” said one. “But I don’t think it’s going to be the same place any more.” As for Jeremy King, when the crisis first unfolded in January, he told one journalist that he enjoys the business too much: “And I’m too young to retire.” The future of the restaurants he opened may be unclear, but it’s certain King will be back.",Lifestyle/Food,In bad taste: the bitter battle for control at leading London restaurants,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/03/in-bad-taste-the-bitter-battle-for-control-at-leading-london-restaurants
4/3/2022,"The rich used saffron as a disinfectant, scattering it on floors and sprinkling it in fires. Known as “red gold” in Britain, it was thought to ward off the plague, as well as adding flavour and a golden hue to food. All across medieval Europe, it was revered by aristocrats and royalty alike. Now academics have delved into accounts of Cambridge colleges from the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries and unearthed evidence of the vast quantities of saffron consumed by medieval intellectuals in the city as a way of enjoying – and showing off – their wealth and elite status. Saffron was so highly valued by masters of Cambridge colleges that local smallholders on land let by the colleges would pay their rent in tiny amounts of the spice, the academics discovered. Before that, to ensure they never ran out, colleges such as Peterhouse, King’s, Pembroke, Queens’ and Jesus even cultivated it in their own college gardens, the research reveals. “Saffron was an essential part of the life of the college,” said Kasia Boddy, professor of American literature at the University of Cambridge. “They cooked with it, used it for medicinal purposes and sometimes they would settle their own bills with it. For example, Peterhouse would pay Pembroke with saffron. It actually functioned as a currency.” At some colleges, such as King’s, it was consumed weekly, despite being a luxury only the elite could afford. “Saffron was so rare that to see it appearing weekly in these books, I got a sense they were being quite opulent and ostentatious,” said Dr Alice Wickenden of Durham University, who carried out the research with Boddy. “It’s easy to imagine it was partly an exercise in showing off wealth.” She thinks the huge demand for saffron from colleges in Cambridge had a “substantial” impact on the local market, where saffron crocuses came to be seen as a highly profitable “cash crop” from the late 14th century onwards. “Local smallholders stopped being just subsistence farmers who were growing crops to feed themselves and their families,” said Boddy. “Now there was this cash crop you could make some extra money on.” Along with Wickenden and Dr Bonnie Lander-Johnson, she will give a talk on Wednesday about the new research at the Cambridge Festival. The chalky soil of south Cambridgeshire and Essex proved well-suited for growing saffron, and soon a major site of saffron production was established just 14 miles away from Cambridge in Chepyng Walden. The town was later renamed Saffron Walden by Henry VIII. “We discovered in the archives that pretty much all the villages between Cambridge and Saffron Walden were also growing saffron, albeit on a smaller scale,” said Boddy, adding that while saffron was also sent to London or traded abroad, “the local market was very much around the colleges”. One of the reasons saffron was so expensive in the Middle Ages – and remains so today – is because harvesting it is very labour intensive: “People would get up at dawn and work until late at night, with a very strong beer brewed expressly for that purpose,” Wickenden said. The bottom fell out of the English market in the 17th century, partly due to the rise of puritanism during the English civil war and the changing habits of the elite. “Everything had to stop being gilded,” said Boddy. “You stopped having your porridge with saffron, you wore plain clothes and you had plain food.”",Arts/Culture,Medieval Cambridge colleges demanded their rent in saffron,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/03/medieval-cambridge-colleges-demanded-their-rent-in-saffron
4/3/2022,"Norwich, home of Sale of the Century and the butt of many jokes is, actually, a lovely city. The cathedral even has some Elizabethan graffiti scratched into its walls that is only apparent if the light is right and you know where to look, but if you do and it is, it’s electrifying to see. It’s also home to Emporium Norwich, a chocolate shop that sells Brazilian artisanal chocolates. The beating heart of it all is something called a brigadeiro – a Brazilian truffle based on condensed milk. The selection of brigadeiros in (14) different flavours that you can choose, is a wonderful thing. Available in boxes of two (£4.35) to 48 (£73.25), these are more than mere chocolates, but mini desserts. If you’re having a drinks party – do we still do those? – and don’t want to make desserts, these would be perfect hand-me-rounds. (Do note the short shelf life and that they really need to be kept in the fridge.) While I loved the coffee and walnut, and the pistachio, and the red velvet, what really did it for me was the Romeo and Juliet – guava and parmesan. I have no idea how this flavour was decided upon, but honestly it was amazing. There are also wonderful brigadeiro cookies (coffee and walnut is the one to go for here), £2.90. A bit crisp, a lot soft and yielding, with an oozy centre. Dipping a toe into Easter, look out for the billionaire shortbread egg (£21.90, 340g), stuffed full of buttery shortbread, caramel and brigadeiro.

4/3/2022,"Vashti Bunyan is a singer whose times have always come slowly, as though in thrall to some kind of cosmic jet lag. Decades after her winsome, haunting debut album Just Another Diamond Day was released in 1970 – sinking without trace – Bunyan went online and discovered that her abject failure, as she had understood it, was now a cult artefact changing hands for silly money. So scarred had Bunyan been by the lack of validation at the time of Diamond Day’s release, she had put music away for an entire lifetime, never even singing to her three children in her otherworldly soprano. Unbeknown to her, she had since become a legend in alternative folk circles. Upon her re-emergence in 2000, Bunyan shared with fawning journalists the extraordinary story of her flower child-era journey from London to Scotland by horse and cart that formed the basis of Just Another Diamond Day: a hippy dream that actually happened. Even better, Bunyan then embarked on a second musical career. The title of this riveting memoir is taken from a song on Bunyan’s second LP, 2005’s equally wonderful Lookaftering. “I wanted to be the one with road dust on my boots,” yearns the title track, “and a single silver earring and a suitcase full of notes.” That song – and Bunyan’s memoir – tells of a countercultural dream gone awry as disillusionment and traditional gender roles clamped down on her youthful waywardness. Blossoming once again in her own time, it has taken another 20 years for Bunyan to write her story down in spare, often luminous prose. “Berneray [in Scotland, where Bunyan lived for a time] held its ancient history near to the surface. With no trees, the only verticals being the new electricity poles, Viking days hung in the air with nothing to absorb them.” And also: “We were two idiot dreamers who chose the wrong island to carry out those dreams upon.” The bare bones of the story will be familiar from the Diamond Day myth: in 1968, in pursuit of a simpler life, Bunyan and her then-partner, an artist, set off for singer Donovan’s place in Scotland in a cart pulled by Bess the horse (“Jog along Bess,” Bunyan sang on the album) with Blue the dog, writing songs as she went. “Towards a Hebridean sun, to build a white tower”, as one song had it. Naturally, their plans hit bumps in the road from the off. The horse they had bought as Betsy (the receipt is included here) turned out to be a decade older than advertised when she was re-shod and the blacksmith at Truman’s Brewery in Brick Lane, east London, recognised her. The fact that the now ex-brewery still had a stable full of dray horses feels extraordinary in itself – 60s London often feels like ancient times in this book. That sense of dislocation is redoubled by the pre-industrial, back-to-basics existence Bunyan and her other half-embraced. They kept clean in rivers, ate little but lentils, pooped in holes in the ground and favoured flowing Victoriana in their dress. Encountering as much suspicion as they did curiosity, they came to depend on the kindness of strangers – and the Traveller community. Bunyan’s mother’s grandfather had been a Romany, a fact painstakingly suppressed by the family that, somehow, did not pass unnoticed in the byways of northern Britain. Even before they set off, you boggle at some of their choices. In 1967, the pair lived inside a bush on Bromley Common for a time. Later, as the miles grew longer and heavier, the pair decided to get poor Bess pregnant. When they finally arrive at Donovan’s mythical redoubt nearly a year later, having overwintered in a house lent to them, there is nowhere for them, or Bess, to stay. They eventually end up on Berneray – the island they “carried out their dreams on” – where the God-fearing locals mostly spurned them, although some were kind. Throughout, the sexism of the times is breathtaking. Bunyan’s boyfriend “offers her” to Donovan. Her fledgling music career was dictated to her by men; many of the arrangements on her album repelled her. When she gave birth out of wedlock, there was considerable pressure to have her children adopted. Bunyan’s life has had numerous acts since then; she recounts these faraway exploits with an awareness ripened with time. The educated way she and her then-partner spoke, for instance, may well have helped keep the police off their backs and unlock some of the kindness they received. Ultimately, though, Bunyan’s story is riveting, and her eventual rebirth as an artist, a triumph of playing the long game.

4/3/2022,"Making music about natural processes or cosmic events is no easy task. Fluttering violins and shimmering percussion are a kneejerk stand-in for awe on many a nature documentary. Electronic music, ambient jazz and Björk, meanwhile, offer up more in the way of crustacean clicks and fissile atemporality. On The Unfolding, Mercury-nominated composer Hannah Peel joins forces with Charles Hazlewood’s Paraorchestra, who combine disabled and non-disabled players on conventional and assisted instruments. They tackle the mineralisation of bones, the geological timescales of Robert Macfarlane’s Underland, and pre-big bang times. Peel’s intentions are sound, the results are very pretty and the live shows will be great, but what ensues is still a modern classical-electronic crossover that relies too much on orthodox musicality to truly do its subjects justice. The presence of a soaring soprano is almost laughably anthropocentric on a track called The Universe Before Matter. The usual tickboxes are out in full: bird calls, or their flute approximations, on Wild Animal and “ah”-ing choirs on Part Cloud.

4/3/2022,"The new tax year starts this week and for many, that means people being worse off. Spiralling energy prices and rising inflation are foremost in the minds of many householders. But changes in the tax system that come into play this week, and some bill increases that have received less attention in the press, are also set to cause a headache. From Wednesday, the controversial rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) will come into effect. Announced last year, the government says the increase is to fund social care and the NHS. Under the changes, both the employed and self-employed will pay 1.25p more in the pound. Employees will be charged 13.25% on earnings between £9,568 and £50,270 and 3.25% on income above that. For the self-employed, class 4 contributions will rise to 10.25% and 3.25%. However, there is some respite to come in July, when the threshold at which NICs start to be paid will rise from £9,880 to £12,570. Accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg says those earning up to £41,389 will be better off than they were in the last tax year, but their pay will dip before then with the new regime. Once your income exceeds that figure, you will still be worse off than in the 2021/22 tax year. For an employed worker earning £50,000, the effect of the two changes will be a decrease in take-home pay of about £200 a year. Tax on share dividends will also increase by 1.25 percentage points, which will particularly affect people who rely on dividends as part of their income. Investors can earn up to £2,000 before they are liable for tax. After that, basic-rate taxpayers will pay 8.75%, while for those on a higher rate it will be 33.75%. A basic-rate taxpayer who receives £10,000 in share dividends will pay £700 in tax, up from £600. In last year’s budget, chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the personal allowance threshold would remain unchanged until 2026, instead of rising in line with inflation. This means the tax-free personal allowance remains at £12,570 for this year; above that threshold 20% income tax kicks in. The threshold for higher-rate income tax in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – when workers start paying 40% – has been frozen at £50,270. The effect will be to bring millions more workers into the tax net. As employees get pay rises, they will be pushed over the thresholds. If your employer has given you a rise to help you keep up with inflation, you might find less of it ends up in your pocket than expected. Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon says: “An individual earning £30,000 last year, who receives a pay rise of the national average 4.8%, will pay an additional £693 income tax in the coming year.” While many people will be focused on the increased cost of their energy, most households will also see a rise in water charges. Overall, bills have gone up 1.7% in England and Wales, pushing up the typical bill by £7 to £419, according to Water UK, the industry body. National Energy Action, a charity which works to eradicate fuel poverty, says there are wide regional differences. In the south-east, customers will potentially see reductions in their bill by 6.2%, but those in the north-east of England may see increases of 10.8%. Jess Cook, of National Energy Action, says the charity expects to see a significant increase in the number of people defaulting on their bills as they struggle with the rising cost of living. In many instances, the water bill is the first to go unpaid, she says: “This should be recognised for what it is – the first sign of substantial difficulty – and support should be available to households at this point to stop them spiralling into debt.” All water companies offer a social tariff, or a reduced bill, to customers experiencing financial difficulty. The WaterSure scheme, meanwhile, helps people who use a lot of water for medical needs and are on benefits, with their bills. Councils around the country have raised bills, with the average Band D demand going up by 3.5% to £1,966 a year – a £68 increase on last year, according to figures from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. The most expensive band D council tax is in Rutland in the East Midlands, where residents pay £2,300, followed by Nottingham, Dorset, and Lewes and Wealden in East Sussex. The lowest band D rate is in Westminster, where bills are £866 a year. Consumer campaigner Martin Lewis has called for homeowners to ensure that they are in the right tax band, and to challenge it via the Gov.uk website, or through the Valuation Office Agency. Council tax payers in England in bands A to D will receive a rebate of £150 on their bills this month, which will not have to be paid back, as part of the government’s plan to ease the pressure during this period of rising costs. The money will be paid straight into the bank accounts of those who have a direct debit set up with their local council, but anyone paying by other means will need to make a claim. The long-term decline in the number of people sending letters, coupled with the rise in inflation, means the price of stamps is increasing from Monday. A first-class stamp will go up 10p to 95p, while second-class will go up 2p to 68p. Meanwhile anyone hoping to fly long-distance after the pandemic restrictions will see the effect of rises in air passenger duty, a tax on passenger flights from UK airports. The rate for long-haul economy flights will go up by £2, while premium economy and higher will increase by £5 from Wednesday.",Lifestyle/Money,"If you thought your energy bill rise was bad, wait until you see these …",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/03/if-you-thought-your-energy-bill-rise-was-bad-wait-until-you-see-these-
4/3/2022,"At least 200 babies born at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust could have lived if their care had been better, including 131 who were stillborn and 70 who died soon after birth. Nine mothers also died avoidable deaths. Lifetimes were stolen as a result of shockingly bad maternity care. Many more were left with profound lifelong disabilities, their parents fighting against the odds for the care and support they will need for the rest of their lives. The Ockenden inquiry, published last week, found that, despite babies suffering fatal fractures as they were forced out of their mothers with forceps and clinicians leaving women screaming in agony for hours, mothers were blamed by midwives and doctors for the deaths and injuries sustained by their babies. It is tragic enough that one baby died as a result of clinical failures. But absolutely unforgivable that it happened again, and again, and again, all while desperate and grieving parents spent more than a decade fighting the system for the truth. There is so much to take away from one of the worst NHS scandals, spanning the 1970s to the present day. I have written about why maternity care has been particularly vulnerable to such dreadful cultures, with inquiries into baby deaths completed or under way in several other NHS trusts. Women are not only less likely to be believed when they say they are in pain, the “normal birth” ideology that has infected some parts of the midwifery profession – the wrong-headed notion that non-medical “natural” birth is always best – combined with the perception that the danger of childbirth is not just a cross for women to bear but something they should embrace without complaint, has made maternity services particularly prone to becoming needlessly life-threatening. But the analysis cannot stop there. There are too many common strands with other examples of systemic negligence in healthcare, such as the Mid-Staffs scandal, where patients were inflicted with dangerously terrible standards of care in the 2000s, and further afield in other parts of the public sector. People treated appallingly by the state, who cannot get answers about what happened to them, let alone the assurances it will not happen again to others, have to dedicate their lives to establishing the truth or let it go. From health to education to the police, poor leadership and bad cultures become ever more self-reinforcing, as whistleblowers are bullied out and good professionals follow. The political response is always “never again”, yet this is a blind spot for both sides of the political spectrum because these experiences fit no grand political narrative. The right obsesses about eliminating waste and improving efficiency in public services; for the left, the story too often stops and starts with the question of resources. Of course, more money is vital. There are those who advance a ludicrous narrative that we spend too much on our healthcare, despite the fact we have invested significantly less per person over the past decade than comparable countries such as Germany and France. We in fact spend too little, leaving the NHS understaffed and without the up-to-date equipment it needs to deliver truly world-class care. But many of these baby deaths – and the Mid-Staffs scandal – happened during the Labour funding boom. It is easy for the left to toss out the right’s lazy rule of thumb of “public sector bad, private sector good”; examples abound of where it has gone horribly and systemically wrong, such as the private equity companies pocketing huge profits from providing substandard care to some of the most vulnerable children. But countless public sector failures show that the left’s inversion of this doctrine can be just as misguided. Where those on the left who equate “public sector” with “good” go wrong is in their analysis of power: they equate it with private profit and leave it at that. But the truth is that nurses, doctors, teachers and police officers can have immense power over people’s lives, often with positive effect, but sometimes with terrible consequences. Just ask the survivors of child sexual abuse in Rotherham, where police prejudice and failures – police officers believed that children as young as 11 could have consensual sex with men three times their age – left their grooming gang abusers free to torture working-class girls whom those officers did not believe worthy of the same protection as their own daughters. Or the young black men stopped and searched over and over again with no good reason by the Metropolitan police. Or the adults failed as children by the dreadful state education they got in the 1970s and 80s, when the soft bigotry of low expectations ran rife across many schools. This was the insight at the heart of one strand of Labour public service reform: more money, but also more accountability. Sure, the targets were blunt, so came with unintended consequences, the inspection systems clunky and in need of improvement. That it took so long to even get inquiries into Mid-Staffs and Shrewsbury and Telford – it was Conservative, not Labour, health secretaries who eventually ordered them – shows how incomplete this reform agenda was. But it was powered by the right insights: the naivety of assuming the collective interests of public sector professionals always align with patients or pupils. Look at the British Medical Association undermining public confidence in (now-vindicated) expert immunologist recommendations about the gap between Covid vaccine doses because of demands from their own members, or the National Education Union’s position in favour of scrapping Ofsted inspections and league tables altogether. (The two inspections I experienced as a former school governor were the opposite of fun, but part and parcel of a school system that puts children first.) The truth is that politicians of all stripes have put too much emphasis on big-bang structural reform – spending vast sums on top-down reorganisations of the health and education systems – rather than on challenging the one thing that failing institutions seem to be so good at: closing ranks and protecting their own. There is no easy short cut to “never again”. It involves the hard and unglamorous work of improving leadership and culture in the worst pockets of the public sector, from dangerous maternity services to corrupt police forces. And never forgetting that power without accountability corrupts certain individuals and therefore institutions. Public or private: nowhere is immune.

4/3/2022,"The number of people with crippling debts who have entered into controversial official agreements to repay the money has reached an all-time high, new figures reveal. Individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) registered in England and Wales totalled 81,199 in 2021, more than double the number in 2015, according to the Insolvency Service. The figures have led to concern that vulnerable Britons are increasingly being lured into unsuitable legally-binding plans by private debt management companies. IVAs are court-approved agreements that usually last for five or six years, and involve a monthly repayment agreed by the creditor. Overseen by a specialist adviser, they are seen as an alternative to full-blown bankruptcy for people who have assets to protect and enough spare income to afford the monthly amount. But it is claimed that they are widely mis-sold, and marketed as an easy fix by companies that earn thousands in commission and fees, despite other solutions often being more suitable. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the market was “broken”, with charities and free debt advice services being “crowded out” by firms that earn up to £1,000 in commission for every person they refer to insolvency practitioners. It said exploitative marketing tactics and “potentially harmful business models” often led to “poor outcomes” for those entering into IVAs, who then faced charges of up to £5,000 on top of the money they owed. The FCA, which regulates debt management companies, has proposed a ban on referral fees for lead generators and plans to publish a policy statement later this year. But charities and finance experts warned that many more people would be trapped in IVAs amid the mounting cost of living, with adverts from IVA lead generation companies appearing at the top of Google searches for phrases such as “debt help”. On Friday, the energy price cap was increased by 54%, meaning that millions face sharp rises in their gas and electricity energy bills. The prices of food, petrol, diesel, council tax, water, car tax and other expenses have also increased. Joe Cox, senior policy officer at anti-debt charity Jubilee Debt Campaign, said intermediaries earn “large commissions by encouraging the mis-selling of IVAs”. He added: “This means people in debt end up paying unnecessary fees for the wrong solution, leaving them stuck in extreme poverty and indebtedness for years.” Ed McDonagh, public policy advocate at the anti-debt charity StepChange, said it was concerning that the number of IVAs had risen so sharply when other debt solutions, such as bankruptcy and debt relief orders, had not. “We can be fairly sure that, given that IVAs are the only debt solution that’s growing, this is largely down to really aggressive client acquisition practices,” he said. His charity had seen evidence of “budgets being manipulated” to make it look like an individual could afford an IVA when they couldn’t. Many people who are “falsely sold” IVAs should be on debt relief orders instead, which are for people with less than £30,000 of debt, few assets and low spare income, and which write off all debt, he said. “Many IVAs fail, which is pretty cataclysmic for those people. They find that most of their payments have gone on fees and their debt level has hardly changed, which can send them into a further spiral of debt and the stress, anxiety and depression that come with that,” McDonagh said. According to the government’s figures, IVAs accounted for nearly three-quarters of all individual insolvencies in 2021 compared with less than 50% before 2014. About a third of IVAs fail, according to the Insolvency Service. Charities have raised concerns about the misleading marketing of IVAs by some lead generation companies, whose adverts are often difficult to distinguish from services that offer free, impartial advice. One advert that appeared last week to those searching online for “debt help” promised to write off 90% of debt, and said it provided “government legislated” solutions. Another said: “Get In Touch. Live A Happy Life.” Last year, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned posts from three Instagram influencers that claimed people in financial trouble could wipe out 85% of their debt. The ASA said the ads for Debt Slayers, a lead generator that refers people to third parties offering IVAs, were “misleading” for failing to highlight the risks. Ashteck Media, trading as Debt Slayers, said at the time that its future adverts would highlight the risks, and that it had stopped using influencers. A spokesperson added on Saturday night that the company had not fully understood how IVAs worked at the time of the ads and that it had now stopped all promotion of them. In a separate case in December, the watchdog ruled that another company offering an “alternative to bankruptcy” had misled customers by suggesting it was affiliated with the government-endorsed National Debtline. The FCA said it was “focused on ensuring that the credit market works well for borrowers” and had proposed banning referral fees from insolvency practitioners. A spokesperson said: “Where we have had significant concerns with debt advice firms, we have removed their permission to provide advice, or restrictions have been placed on them. “We will continue to work closely with the Insolvency Service to address this issue.”",Lifestyle/Money,Repayment plans pushing thousands into deeper debt,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/03/repayment-plans-pushing-thousands-into-deeper-debt
4/3/2022,"Scientists fear that their last-ditch climate warnings are going unheeded amid international turmoil caused by the war in Ukraine, and soaring energy prices. The third segment of the landmark scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – which could be the last comprehensive assessment of climate science to be published while there is still time to avoid the worst ravages of climate breakdown – will be published on Monday, warning that the world is not shifting quickly enough to a low-carbon economy. But the previous instalment of the vast report – known as working group 2 of the IPCC – was published a month ago, just as Russia invaded Ukraine, and received only muted attention, despite warning of catastrophic and irreversible upheavals that can only narrowly be avoided by urgent action now. Scientists told the Observer that Monday’s fresh scientific warning must spur governments to belated action. Deborah Brosnan, adjunct professor of biology at Virginia Tech University in the US and a scientific consultant, told the Observer: “That [working group 2] report was widely anticipated, but completely ignored. Eclipsed mostly by the war in Ukraine, and domestic issues such as inflation, most major media have barely reported let alone analysed the findings.” She said people were shocked by the Ukraine war, and concerned about soaring prices, but that the climate crisis also needed urgent attention. “The war in Ukraine is a terrible tragedy playing out before our eyes, and families rightly fear being pushed into poverty by inflation. Yet we seem blind to the fact that an even larger and existential crisis is already unfolding today – one that will result in a global humanitarian crisis and on a scale never seen before.” Daniela Schmidt, professor at Bristol University and one of the lead authors of the working group 2 report, said the world’s current upheavals show how vulnerable we are to the impacts of the climate crisis, already being felt. Policymakers should consider where their resources are allocated, she advised. “Due to the geopolitical challenges, little political capacity is spent on climate action, and vast amounts of funding are allocated to defence,” she told the Observer. “[But] the current situation also clearly shows people’s widespread vulnerability to climate change.” Governments have at least been waking up to the problem behind the scenes, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics. “The IPCC report did struggle to gain attention. But while public discussion may have been muted, governments around the world are now studying the details of the report, and particularly its findings about how to make countries, companies and communities more resilient to those consequences of climate change that cannot now be avoided,” Ward said. The report, due to be published ,Monday’s will deal with ways governments and the public can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including greater use of renewable energy, growing trees and cutting-edge technology to suck carbon from the air. But its warnings – that the world is failing to deploy these methods at the scale required to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – will be muted by the bureaucracy of the IPCC’s processes. The report itself – part 3 of the sixth comprehensive assessment of climate science to be published by the IPCC since its foundation in 1988 – is based on thousands of scientific papers from the last seven years. But the key document published on Monday, the summary for policymakers, could be as short as 20 to 30 pages, consisting of a series of short messages and data. These messages are subject to intense wrangling by both scientists and governments. Under the IPCC methods, all governments have the right to make changes to the final summary – and some are exercising those rights by toning down findings and vetoing some of the strongest statements. Saudi Arabia, India, China and a few other countries have sought to make changes that would weaken the final warnings, the Observer understands. Some governments are anxious to avoid policy advice such as cutting subsidies to fossil fuels, even though these are widely espoused by leading authorities.This process of refinement – which has also been a complaint in the previous chapters of the IPCC assessment – is defended by some, as producing a document that all governments must “own”, as they have all had input. But many scientists are growing increasingly frustrated, as it produces a conservative and sometimes watered down document that many feel does not reflect the urgency and shocking nature of the threat.",News/Environment,Dire warning on climate change ‘is being ignored’ amid war and economic turmoil,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/03/dire-warning-on-climate-change-is-being-ignored-amid-war-and-economic-turmoil

4/3/2022,"Ifinally went abroad last week. It was a wrench to leave my silent monastic cell of a home office, with my blanket nest and laptop stand arranged just so, but a trip to Paris trumped all that. I’ve been bleating about it for months, pining like a Chekhov character, imagining café terraces and stalking Parisian pastry accounts on Instagram. My sister, who lives there, bought a flat recently, which sharpened my urge to go and cast a hard sibling eye over her soft furnishings, gossip about her neighbours and rate her local bakery. That was January; it took me until March to stop dithering and get on a train. I started regretting it around Doncaster when the man across the aisle began watching a medley of Premiership goals without headphones, while the one in front of me was vigorously phlegm clearing. Following an hour queueing at passport control behind people astonished they needed to show their passports, I squeezed on to the Eurostar next to a group of large adult sons, loud, maskless and crumb-coated. “PEOPLE,” I messaged a friend, because tutting felt like an inadequate outlet. “PEOPLE,” she messaged back, sympathetically. People. Lots of them are travelling again, taking advantage of the new freedom from Day 2 tests and PLFs. I know, because I am “people”, and I am doing it. But I’m apprehensive and ready to anger, as if a nasty, coiled-up part of me expects the world to be enraging and is sourly satisfied when it is. People: they don’t wear masks (as is their right); they talk loudly (permitted); manspread (should be illegal, but isn’t); shriek as they open cans of 9am cocktail and make video calls in the “quieter” coach. (Incidentally, it feels ominous that the quiet coach has been downgraded to the quieter coach, as if our behaviour has so deteriorated, quiet is no longer a realistic expectation.) People: they stare at you balefully as if they are the train police, sighing theatrically if you so much as sip your water (OK, this is me). Was it always like this? Yes, probably. But I think some of us have also lost the habit of other people, the look and sound of them, the affront of their marginally different choices. Like unsocialised pandemic toddlers, we’re either blithely doing whatever the hell we like in public, because we’ve forgotten it’s not home, or sulking because not everyone behaves exactly as we would like. It feels stressful – should I just give up and never go anywhere again? Is it worth the aggravation? It was totally worth it. I saw my sister, at last, and we walked for miles and sat on those cane chairs on a Seine-front terrace. There was so much to see: influencers changing outfits under flowering magnolias; shops selling one impossibly complex garment, or seven million antique pipes; dogs, all the dogs, from handbag- to horse-sized. I queued for a cake from superstar pâtissier Cédric Grolet that looked like a wizened prehistoric phallus (OK, vanilla pod) and gaped at Marie Antoinette’s tiny slipper and Marat’s jawbone. I also went to the new blockbuster Proust exhibition (surely only in Paris could this command overflow queues, literary fanboys and girls kettled in anticipation). One of the relics attracting a crowd was a panel of the cork used to soundproof his room. I have long empathised with Proust’s acute noise sensitivity: a book of letters to his neighbour is basically a more elegantly expressed version of the angry notes you find pinned to apartment block walls. But here, another exhibit held me rapt. It’s a handwritten list of the street calls of 1919 Paris, drawn up for Proust by a Monsieur Charmel, a concierge he asked to investigate on his behalf. That jerky, accelerated black and white footage we have of early 1900s street scenes is silent, but the list made me realise how loud it would have been. Charmel describes a cacophony of traders, loudly hawking cheese, “good, fresh mussels”, “green and tender” beans, artichokes or peas; there’s an upholsterer with a trumpet, a knife sharpener with a bell and someone playing the harmonica. He’s sorry, Charmel concludes, he can’t convey their “inimitable melody or intonation”. Quietly tucked away in his sickbed (he died three years later), Proust was hungry for news of noise, for proof of life. That’s why you leave your safe, cork-lined room. For people: the sight, and yes, the “inimitable melody or intonation” of them, the delicious pick ’n’ mix of their eccentricities. I am trying hard to recalibrate my instinctive response and remind myself that noise is life, that people are often what makes places special. When I managed, there were wonders in the soundscape: fashion gossip, presidential election talk, old friends squabbling over who should pay for lunch and a man negotiating refinancing for his hotel group in the Congo in the passport queue. It’s easier on holiday, of course, and even then, it’s not always a delight. But the drunk, singing Italian couple on the way back at least united my train carriage in eye-rolling frustration. People are entertaining, inspiring, enraging, too much and absolutely essential. I want more.

4/3/2022,"He thinks he is going to get away with it. When Boris Johnson addressed a recent dinner with his parliamentary party, he poked fun at those Tory MPs who were so disgusted by partygate that they tried to remove him. The king of crass comedy quipped that they should be grateful that they did not live in Russia where Vladimir Putin has “nobody to write 54 letters to Sir Grahamski Bradyski”. He was especially mocking of those Conservative MPs who wrote to demand a confidence vote and then withdrew their letters after the invasion of Ukraine. These missives were “elastic – they go in and you can pull out”. Just a few weeks ago, he stood on the precipice of losing the premiership. Someone who ought to know tells me that the number of letters submitted to Sir Graham got close to the threshold that would have triggered a confidence vote. Now the prime minister feels able to wine, dine and crack wise with his MPs. And to do so in the very same week that the Metropolitan police started issuing penalties for law-breaking at Number 10, imposing 20 fines in the first wave and with more expected to follow. It is appalling enough that the Met has found a pattern of criminality at the very heart of government. It is worse that the prime minister treats this as a laughing matter. One senior Tory present at the dinner says: “The number of jokes Boris devoted to partygate showed that he is either monumentally insensitive or monumentally self-confident.” Or both. This confirms that Mr Johnson feels neither genuine shame nor sincere remorse for the rampant lockdown-busting in Downing Street during the pandemic. It also tells us that this scandal has not changed his essential character one jot. That ought to alarm everyone, including the Tory MPs who laughed along with his jokes. They may have found the prime minister funny, but there is no reason to suppose that the country feels entertained. On their way to the revelries at the Park Plaza hotel near Westminster Bridge, Conservative MPs had to pass a protesting group of bereaved families of Covid casualties who shouted “shame on you” and “off to another party, are we?” Those who lost loved ones, often being denied the opportunity to hold the hand of a dying relative for one last time or even to attend the funeral, have not forgotten or forgiven. Partygate cut through to the public much more widely and much more deeply than the typical political scandal. Everyone can grasp the stark hypocrisy of the denizens of Downing Street flouting the restrictions that they imposed on everyone else. Nor can it be disputed that Mr Johnson issued repeated false denials about it to both parliament and the public. He remains under investigation himself, the events he attended including the notorious “bring-your-own-booze” party organised by his private secretary. The prime minister’s excuse, that he mistook a garden packed with people chugging wine for “a work event”, is no less risible now than it was when he first concocted that alibi. At Westminster, partygate is largely treated as yesterday’s news. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the cabinet’s specialist at defending the indefensible, has tried to exploit the war to dismiss the scandal as “disproportionate fluff”. But voters don’t think in the same way as politicians and telling them that they were silly to be affronted by partygate only makes them crosser. The public is capable of holding two thoughts in its head at one time: the war in Ukraine is a grave international crisis and law-breaking at Number 10 is a grave issue for Britain’s democracy. The polling companies agree that the public have settled on a verdict that is unlikely to change, whatever happens next. They have made up their minds about the prime minister. James Johnson, a pollster who sampled opinion for the Tories when Theresa May was at Number 10, reports that there has been a “consistent picture in all our focus groups since the start of January”. He quotes one voter describing the Tory leader as “a buffoon, a joke, an idiot and, worst of all, a liar. You can’t have a liar.” Another calls him “a hypocritical clown”. A third settles for the simple but searing “pathetic”. When the revelations about partygate were at their most intense, Mr Johnson’s approval ratings plunged to depths not visited by any prime minister in more than 25 years. They have recovered only a little since the beginning of the war. He remains deeply unpopular. There’s been scant sign of the “rally to the flag” benefit that Number 10 hoped would result from the outbreak of the most serious conflict in Europe since 1945. Johnson loyalists who talked deliriously about the war providing him with a “Falklands moment” have shown themselves in need of a lesson in good taste, a history tutorial and the attention of a clinician. Tories are now beginning to twitch about the local elections in early May. “I think they are going to be bad, possibly very bad, especially in London,” says one Conservative MP. These tests of public opinion will be immediately preceded by the hike in the rate of national insurance biting into pay packets for the first time, a huge jump in energy bills and surging prices for many other essentials. Lengthening waiting times and staff shortages have contributed to an unprecedentedly sharp fall in public satisfaction with the National Health Service. If the Tories are thumped at the ballot box this spring, it will be hard to say definitively how much of it is down to partygate and how much of it is about the state of public services and the squeeze on household budgets. What we do know, from past experience, is that voters get angrier about political scandals when they are feeling miserable about their own circumstances. Some Tories see danger for their leader in seething fury about partygate combining with discontent about the cost of living crunch. Says one: “It will make some of my colleagues more susceptible to the argument that we won’t win the next election if we don’t change leader.” Even some of the Johnson loyalists believe that “he is not out of the woods yet”. The police investigation into a dozen events in Downing Street during the pandemic, at least three of which were attended by the prime minister, is far from exhausted. No previous British prime minister has been found to have broken the criminal law while in office. If the police serve him with a fine, he will be in the position, always previously held to be untenable, of a law-maker being exposed as a law-breaker. Conservative MPs will then have to decide whether to remove him or make themselves accessories to the crime. Context will matter a lot to their calculations. “It is all about the timing,” says one former Tory cabinet minister. If he gets fined when Ukraine is still the centre of attention, or if some other emergency has erupted, then there will be a reduced chance of Mr Johnson being defenestrated by his MPs. If not, then he will be in greater danger of being ejected at the hands of his own party. Even if he escapes a police penalty, many of the public have already concluded that the prime minister is an incorrigibly mendacious rule-breaker. That is a problem not just for the Conservative party, but for everyone else too. One of the many damaging dimensions of this scandal is that it has severely compromised the capacity of the government to carry people with it at a time when effective and persuasive leadership is vitally necessary. In hard and perilous times, a leader has to be able to ask difficult things of the people in the national interest. This is a period when Britain needs a prime minister who can convince the country that sacrifices need to be made for the sake of helping the Ukrainians to resist the Russians, in order to cope with the global energy crisis, or in the event that Covid springs another nasty surprise on us. Mr Johnson cannot be that prime minister. He has lost the trust of the public and not won it back among his own MPs. Many still want him gone, not least for fear of what might happen next if the greased piglet somehow manages to squirm his way out of partygate. One senior Tory remarks: “If Boris gets away with this, he will think that he can get away with anything.” That’s a formula for more, and quite possibly worse, outrages to come. Boris Johnson may think he is done with partygate, but the anger about it is not done with him.
