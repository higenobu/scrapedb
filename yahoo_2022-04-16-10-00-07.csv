4/16/2022,"The governor of Mississippi has declared April to be both Confederate Heritage Month and Genocide Awareness Month. Gov. Tate Reeves unpacked Genocide Awareness Month as a time to reflect on the “systematic destruction of lives” and noted it had “no place in society,” but he neglected to mention the devastating race-based institution of American slavery or the near destruction of Native American people by white colonizers in the country. The Magnolia State’s top government executive declared also Confederate Heritage Month as a time to recognize the state’s Civil War history, a tradition initiated by his predecessors in 1993. “April is the month when, in 1861, the American Civil War began between the Confederate and Union armies, reportedly the costliest and deadliest war ever fought on American soil,” read Reeves from the proclamation. “As we honor all who lost their lives in the war, it is important for all Americans to reflect upon our nation’s past, to gain insight from our mistakes and successes, and to come to a full understanding that the lessons learned yesterday and today will carry us through tomorrow if we carefully and earnestly strive to understand and appreciate our heritage and our opportunities which lie before us,” the governor continued in the document. During an April 8 news conference presenting the proclamation, Reeves was asked by a local reporter about his decision, “Do you believe that’s to conflate considering the documented history of killing and racism toward people of color in the Confederate South?” A seemingly defiant Reeves responded, “Look, I signed the Confederate Heritage Month in the month of April in the same manner and fashion that the five governors that came before me, Republicans and Democrats alike for over 30 years, have done that. And we did it again this year. Didn’t think this was the year to stop doing it, so.” Despite Reeves’ claim, one voice quickly objected, suggesting Reeves was being misleading. Former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, a Democrat that served in the capacity from 1988 to 1992 and one of the last five governors, said he never supported this initiative, saying, “My question for Gov Reeves is ‘so what’ if 5 Governors have signed it. Doesn’t make it right.” I absolutely did not issue anything like this. It started with Fordice, an overt White supremacist. My question for Gov Reeves is “so what” if 5 Governors have signed it. Doesn’t make it right. https://t.co/D3C7ddQVqW — Ray Mabus (@SECNAV75) April 14, 2022 He further tweeted his disdain for the proclamation, “The only heritages of the Confederacy as far as I can tell are slavery and treason.” On the second proclamation, Reeves specifically identified the following genocides from three of the seven continents starting at the top of the 20th century: Armenia (1913); the Ukrainian Holodomor (1932); the Holocaust (1941); Cambodia (1972); Bosnia (1992); Rwanda (1994); and Darfur (2003). Noting that, in part, genocide is “the systematic destruction of all or a significant part of a racial, ethnic, religious or national group …” Not surprisingly, Reeves’ dual proclamation drew the ire of not only politicians, but also everyday citizens. A local reporter tweeted that Reeves sidestepped questions on whether “he believes there is a conflict between declaring April as Confederate Heritage Month as well as Genocide Awareness Month.” Others wondered where were America’s original sins. “So uh, did you just forget about Native Americans and all those black people we had shipped over to do our SLAVE labor?” read one tweet.

Like, all of them,” read another. Mississippi State Director of the Southern Poverty Law Center Mississippi said n a statement, “It is unfortunate that the governor chooses to glorify the Confederacy — a traitorous government that fought against the United States for the right to enslave Blacks.” Many have also pointed out the governor’s announcement comes in the aftermath of his signing the state’s highly contested critical race theory law on March 14, where he called CRT a curriculum of indoctrination created to “humiliate” whites. Reeves, who said, on Fox News “there is not systemic racism in America,” said when signing the bill, “Students are being force-fed an unhealthy dose of progressive fundamentalism that runs counter to the principles of America’s founding,” implying falsely that CRT is being taught at the K-12 level. “Children are dragged to the front of the classroom and are coerced to declare themselves as oppressors,” he continued. “That they should feel guilty because of their race, or that they are inherently a victim because of their race.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,‘Did You Just Forget … All Those Black People We Shipped Over?’: Mississippi Governor Confuses Many When He Declares April Both Confederate Heritage Month and Genocide Awareness Month,https://news.yahoo.com/did-just-forget-those-black-231800616.html
4/16/2022,"A Vietnamese father from the province of Nghệ An was sentenced to 14 years in prison for selling his daughter to human traffickers.

Lo Pho Pheng, 47, sold his 13-year-old biological daughter to a man in China for over 150 million Vietnamese dong (approximately $6,550) when he lacked the money to pay for medical treatment for a heart condition.

Pheng met with Lo Thi Cam, 35, in 2018 to propose selling his daughter, who referred him to Moon Thi Xum, 46.

Xum and a man identified as “Hong” took Pheng’s daughter to China to be sold off.

Pheng was able to receive 100 million VND (approximately $4,367). Xum also received 7 million VND (approximately $306), and Cam received 13 million VND (approximately $568).

Pheng’s daughter was able to escape back to Vietnam in October 2021 when she filed a denunciation of the crime to the Investigation Police Agency in the Kỳ Sơn District Police.

In the courtroom, the defendants pleaded guilty to their crimes. Pheng said that he “did not think straight” because of his lack of knowledge and poverty-stricken situation.

Xum was sentenced to 13 years in prison, while Cam was sentenced to 12 years. Although the victim requested a lenient sentence for her father, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for “trafficking of a person under 16.”

4/16/2022,"North Korea has finished construction of an 80-story residential skyscraper complete with penthouses in the capital of Pyongyang, but only some of the least fortunate in the country reportedly choose to live on the top floors of the country's high-rise apartments.

Defectors have said that many North Koreans take issue with the higher floors of these apartments due to a lack of working elevators, electrical issues, minimal water supply and poor overall safety and quality, according to Reuters.

“In North Korea, the poor live in penthouses rather than the rich because lifts are often not working properly, and they cannot pump up water due to the low pressure,"" Jung Si-woo, a 31-year-old North Korean defector, told Reuters.

Jung gave an example, adding, “A friend who lived on the 28th floor of a 40-story block had never used the elevator because it was not working. Most elevators worked just twice a day, during peak commuting hours from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., and the same timing in the evening.”

North Korean citizens are not given many options because housing is assigned, and the buying and selling of homes is illegal.

According to state media, housing development is an important goal for North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, and he has promised to build thousands of apartments. On Wednesday, the country completed construction on 10,000 new apartments, taking pride in their completion time and quality.

In Jung’s opinion, however, the efforts are theatrics. “It's to show how much their construction skills have improved, rather than considering residents' preferences.”

The editor-in-chief of Daily NK, Lee Sang-yong, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, corroborates Jung’s claims, saying his sources reported that the “apartments for regular people were not ready to live in.”

“Windows had only frames, and water taps, though installed, were not working; but the recently completed luxury homes come complete with furniture and utensils,” Lee explains.

 Kim Jong Un recently gifted a two-story luxury apartment to North Korean TV anchor Ri Chun-hee as thanks for her loyalty, saying, “There is nothing to spare for national treasures like Ri Chun-hee, who has led a virtuous life with the revolutionary microphone.”    Feature Image via (stephan)/Wikimedia Commons Enjoy this content?

4/16/2022,"CHISINAU (Reuters) - (This April 14 story makes clear in headline and first paragraph that Moldova did not directly accuse the Russian army, and corrects day on which minister made comments; in fourth and fifth paragraph adds context of minister's remarks and corrects exact wording of quote) Moldova said on Wednesday that reports that Russia's army was trying to recruit Moldovan citizens were dangerous and that it was regularly discussing all matters of concern with Russian officials, in response to a question about the Ukraine war. The comments came days after British military intelligence said that Moscow was trying to replenish its forces in Ukraine by recruiting in the breakaway Transdniestria region. Transdniestria is a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russian separatists that runs along the east of Moldova and comes to within about 25 miles (40 km) of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. Responding to a question from local journalists about alleged Russian attempts to recruit people in Transdniestria, Moldovan Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu said: ""These are not actions that contribute to peace for all of us, for our citizens, for our families, and these are dangerous things and should be discouraged"". ""There are a series of regular meetings between my colleagues at the Foreign Ministry and the ambassador of the Russian Federation, where Moldova is clearly articulating its position."" Moscow's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters was not able to verify whether Russia's army has been trying to recruit Moldovans. On Thursday, Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar said that Russia was massing troops in several areas including Transdniestria for a ""further escalation"" in Ukraine. Moldova said last month that it was monitoring the situation in Transdniestria, where an estimated 1,500 Russian troops are based, but that it had not seen significant changes since Russia's invasion of Ukraine started on Feb. 24. Transdniestria's authorities denied on Monday Russia was conducting any military preparations on its territory that threatened Ukraine. The region's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday about the remarks by Ukraine's Malyar. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and root out what it views as dangerous nationalists, but Ukraine and the West say Russia launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

4/16/2022,"LONDON — As the Russia-Ukraine war entered its eighth week, Russia confirmed that its flagship vessel in the Black Sea sank — with Ukrainians crediting their anti-ship missile for the action — while CIA Director William Burns warned that the U.S. can’t “take lightly” the possibility that Russia would use nuclear weapons. Moscow’s Defense Ministry confirmed on Thursday that the Moskva, Russia’s leading battleship in the country’s naval assault against Ukraine, sank while being towed to port during a storm. “While being towed ... towards the destination port, the vessel lost its balance due to damage sustained in the hull as fire broke out after ammunition exploded. Given the choppy seas, the vessel sank,” Russian state news agency Tass reported, quoting the ministry’s statement. Moscow initially said a “fire” set off some of its weapons and that “ammunition exploded on board” as a result. Officials said the crew, believed to include around 500 sailors, was safely evacuated from the burning ship. The ministry said the fire is now under investigation. However, the governor of Odesa claimed the damage was a result of a Ukrainian missile strike on Wednesday — which Moscow has denied. Russia’s military setbacks in the war against Ukraine could lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin using low-yield, or tactical, nuclear weapons, William Burns, the director of the CIA, warned on Thursday. Speaking at Georgia Tech, in Atlanta, Burns said: “Given the potential desperation of President Putin and the Russian leadership, given the setbacks that they’ve faced so far, militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons or low-yield nuclear weapons.” Burns added that the CIA has been watching the Kremlin “very intently” but said the U.S. had yet to see any signs that Putin was preparing to use those weapons. Russia has had nuclear forces on high alert since its invasion began on Feb. 24. Russia’s Defense Ministry pledged on Friday to launch more strikes against Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, following the loss of the Moskva battleship. “The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime,” the ministry said in a statement. A military factory in Kyiv that allegedly produced the Neptune missiles that Ukraine claimed it used to strike the Moskva was targeted overnight on Thursday. In a diplomatic note to the Biden administration, Russia warned the U.S. that there would be “unpredictable consequences” if Washington keeps sending military assistance to Ukraine. “We call on the United States and its allies to stop the irresponsible militarization of Ukraine, which implies unpredictable consequences for regional and international security,” the note said, according to the Washington Post. On Wednesday, President Biden authorized $800 million in military assistance for Ukraine. The shipment will include a wide range of weapons, including helicopters and Switchblade armed drones, as well as medical equipment. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged European countries to stop buying Russian oil that provides “blood” money to the Putin regime. Speaking to the BBC in an interview published on Thursday, Zelensky criticized Hungary and Germany for preventing an oil embargo. “We don’t understand how you can make money out of blood,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is what some countries have been doing, European countries.” The Ukrainian leader added: “Some of our friends and partners understand that it is a different time now, that it is no longer an issue of business and money. That it is an issue of survival.” At least 503 people in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region have been killed since the invasion began on Feb. 24, the local governor, Oleg Synegubov, said this week. Writing on the social media app Telegram, he said the dead included 24 children. _____",World/Yahoo News,Russia-Ukraine war latest: Key Russian vessel sinks as CIA warns about Putin's potential use of nuclear weapons,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-war-latest-key-russian-vessel-sinks-as-cia-warns-about-putins-potential-use-of-nuclear-weapons-134659324.html
