1/13/2022,"Prince Andrew has been forced to scale back his royal duties in the wake of sexual assault allegations from Virginia Giuffre, claims he strenuously denies. Aside from his royal roles, private firms such as BT and Barclays have also severed ties with him in recent years.  But he still remains the Duke of York, has kept the title HRH and is the patron or honorary member of more than 100 charities and organisations. Now that a civil sex assault case against him can go ahead, he could face rigorous questions over his private life in open court – potentially further damaging his public standing in the UK. But what does the future hold for the duke, and what could he stand to lose? Financial damages If he loses his case, US legal experts speculate that Andrew could face a bill that runs into millions of dollars, as there is no limit to possible damages. The press has been rife with speculation over how the duke has paid his lawyers, with some papers alleging the Queen has helped fund her second son’s legal bills and others saying she has refused to do so. But she will want to avoid being seen to have any role in helping to pay any potential damages. Andrew has recently been told he can sell his multimillion-pound Swiss ski chalet after paying a debt to a French socialite, which could alleviate any potential financial worries. HRH title Meghan and Harry were asked to stop using their His and Her Royal Highness titles when they stopped being working members of the royal family in February 2020. After his disastrous Newsnight interview, a few months before, Andrew had also stepped back from royal duties. However, he couldkeep his HRH status despite calls for him to lose it. Nigel Cawthorne, author of Prince Andrew: Epstein, Maxwell and the Palace, has speculated that he could be told to drop the title in the wake of the lawsuit. “There are too many legal questions surrounding the prince and it is increasingly doubtful that he can hold on to his HRH status,” he told Newsweek. Duke of York title There has been speculation that Andrew could be stripped of the title the Duke of York if he loses the case. But royal biographer Christopher Warwick is doubtful. Citing 1917 legislation aimed at preventing “enemy royals” using British titles, he told Sky: “Andrew is not an enemy of Britain, so the Titles Deprivation Act wouldn’t come into it.” Other honorary roles The duke has already had to abandon his Pitch@Palace mentoring scheme after sponsors deserted the initiative. He was also forced to resign as chancellor of the University of Huddersfield. The Outward Bound Trust ditched Andrew as its patron, while his role as president of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions also came to an end. But Andrew is still listed on the royal family’s website as patron or honorary member of 106 charities and organisations, from the Army Officer’s Golfing Society to the Yorkshire Society. These include dozens of golf clubs, but also hospitals and private schools. Military titles After his stint in the Royal Navy, including his service in the Falklands war where he claims he lost the ability to sweat, Andrew has 15 honorary military titles. Some of these, notably his role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards, are now in doubt. Grenadier Guards officers are reportedly “uncomfortable having to drink to the health of Prince Andrew at the end of regimental dinners”. Former lance sergeant Julian Perreira told the Daily Mail: “Prince Andrew will put a stain on the regiment’s proud history and will devalue the hard work of past and future generations of Grenadiers. He must step down immediately.”",News/UK news,Prince Andrew: what does duke’s future hold and what might he lose?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/prince-andrew-what-does-dukes-future-hold-and-what-might-he-lose
1/13/2022,"Good morning. The true picture of Omicron’s spread in Australia is becoming clearer as New South Wales joins other states in recording rapid tests results, Prince Andrew fails in his bid to have a sexual abuse lawsuit dismissed, and Novak Djokovic faces serious consequences for his actions after testing positive for Covid in December. The Omicron wave has been more damaging for business than lockdown, Melbourne business owners have calculated, with the absence of state or federal support exacerbating Covid-related staff shortages. On the retail and hospitality strip Chapel Street, 35% of the 2,200 staff employed have lost shifts while either sick or isolating, prompting business owners to call for a return of the $750-a-week disaster payments. Across the nation, businesses are temporarily closing as food shortages continue and music festivals are cancelled. Aged care providers have said family members have been providing critical care services due to staff shortages, with Covid outbreaks in at least 495 facilities nationally. Rates of hospitalisation have hit record highs, prompting doctors to encourage mild symptom sufferers to remain at home. It comes as NSW prepares for a huge jump in its Covid figures, with more than 50,000 positive rapid tests already registered after the online system was launched yesterday.  Prince Andrew faces a damaging, high-profile court case, after a New York judge quashed his lawyers’ attempts to have Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him thrown out. The Duke of York’s legal team had attempted to argue that a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein shielded the duke from the lawsuit, but judge Lewis Kaplan ruled the case against the prince could proceed. Analysts say it’s “a devastating blow” for the Duke of York, and by association, the royal family. Prince Andrew faces giving evidence and undergoing cross-examination over his association with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell and sex offender Epstein, unless an out-of-court settlement is reached. Novak Djokovic could face a fine or even prison in Serbia after his admission that he broke isolation while he had Covid last month, lawyers have said. The world No 1 male tennis player is still waiting for the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to decide whether to deport him. Djokovic on Wednesday acknowledged that he attended a newspaper interview and photoshoot in Belgrade on 18 December, just after he was alerted to his positive Covid test. The player also blamed “human error” by his support team for a mistake in his immigration paperwork, in a statement which has raised further questions. Lawyers in Serbia told local reporters that breaking the country’s strict isolation rules was an offence and subject to a fine or prison sentence of up to three years – although community service was more likely. Michaelia Cash’s department has defended religious schools’ right to sack teachers for their views on sexuality and appeared to confirm that safeguards for gay students will be delayed until after the religious discrimination bill. Former MP Tony Windsor has backed the request by traditional owners that the New South Wales government protect sacred sites on land sold back to farmers after a campaign by the Gomeroi people prevented Chinese mining company Shenhua from mining the property. A Perth magistrate has thrown out a case against an Extinction Rebellion activist, charged with aiding and abetting activists who used washable chalk to write messages on a suburban bridge. Human Rights Watch called the actions of police in the case “excessive and overzealous”. Boris Johnson is facing calls from his own party to step down as UK prime minister, after he admitted, via a carefully worded statement, to having attended a Downing Street party during lockdown, believing it was a “work event”. Nato’s secretary general has warned of “a real risk for a new armed conflict in Europe”, after talks between Russian, US, and Nato delegates ending without progress over the Ukraine crisis. EU dignitaries meanwhile have complained of being “deliberately excluded” from the talks. An 80-year-old Palestinian man, detained and handcuffed during an Israeli raid, has been found dead. The body of Omar Abdalmajeed As’ad was found with a plastic zip-tie still around one wrist, but the Israeli military says he was alive when their soldiers released him. “It’s almost impossible to crowbar other people into doing what we think they should.” Faced with three people locked into “or else” propositions, advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith recommends turning the other cheek. “Sometimes the parts of our lives we mess up in are the ones where we never thought we could do well: ‘I’m just like this.’ It takes real energy and self possession to break irresponsible habits – I wonder if hearing ‘you are up to this task’ might fuel him more than ‘you aren’t and you should be’”. “When covering the economy at the moment, it is best to remember the old joke that if you’re not confused, it is because you’re not paying attention.” Between the pandemic madness, historic trend disruption, and partisan spin, it’s hard to make top or tail of most present economic indicators, Greg Jericho explains. “So how is the economy going? In reality we don’t really know – nothing is as it usually is, nor as we can expect it to be in the future.” “Amid a flurry of data breaches, password leaks and Malware text scams last year, many of us have become more aware of the need to secure our digital information.” So how to navigate endless, tedious requests for unique alphabetical and numerical combinations? As Rafqa Touma writes, it’s time to embrace the era of the password manager: “the trusty vault of codes long forgotten”. As Feather Thompson recounts, when her husband Merv’s scattered ashes kept washing back in at the beach “it was clear [he] didn’t want to go.” A sailor, and Thompson’s companion of 60 years, connection with the sea always brought back fond memories of Merv, she tells Christine Retschlag.

But as numerous Australians and Englishmen await nervous selection chats, as Geoff Lemon writes, headaches over Mitchell Starc’s selection lead the line. The African Cup of Nations has been engulfed by farce, with a Zambian referee incorrectly blowing full-time on a match between Tunisia and Mali, twice. Tunisia’s coach claims his players were already in post-match ice baths before being recalled to the pitch. Archaeologists have handed down a scathing assessment of the heritage report filed as part of a $1bn proposal to raise the wall of Warragamba Dam, the Sydney Morning Herald reports, calling the work “manifestly inadequate” in meeting Aboriginal heritage expectations. A temporary relaxation of visa regulations will allow 400,000 foreign students to work extra hours, according to the Financial Review. The move is designed to help ease Covid-19 related labour shortages. And, the mastermind behind an alleged $150m phone text scam in the US has pleaded guilty as part of a plea deal that could see him serve his jail time in Australia, the West Australian writes. The draw for the Australian Open will be conducted on Thursday at 3pm, AEDT. The religious discrimination bill will go before a public hearing of the human rights committee. What’s the worst moment during a blind date you can remember? For one woman in China, a snap decision for the city of Zhengzhou to go into lockdown has meant her date has not yet ended. And while her daily video diaries have become viral sensations, the extra time together hasn’t seen love bloom, with the woman, Wang, describing her would-be paramour as “as mute as a wooden mannequin”, and his cooking skills as “mediocre”.

1/13/2022,"Nursing and midwifery leaders have urged Sajid Javid to delay the introduction of compulsory Covid jabs for NHS staff and said the controversial policy amounted to “self-sabotage”. The plea from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and Royal College of Midwives (RCM) comes as NHS trusts in England prepare to start sending out dismissal letters from 3 February to any member of staff who has not had their first dose of a vaccine by then.  They fear that the exodus of frontline personnel that mandatory vaccination is likely to trigger will make it even harder for NHS care providers to maintain normal care, given it would happen just as the service is grappling with record levels of staff sickness closely linked to the Omicron variant. The government’s own risk assessment of mandatory jabs published last November estimated that it could lead to the loss of 73,000 staff in a service that in England already has 93,000 vacancies. NHS bosses recently warned that that could make it unsafe and unviable to run entire units of hospitals, especially maternity units. “We are calling on the government to recognise this risk and delay a move, which by its own calculations looks set to backfire,” said Pat Cullen, the RCN’s general secretary and chief executive. “To dismiss valued nursing staff during this crisis would be an act of self-sabotage.” Cullen advised ministers to extend the deadline for staff to have two doses of vaccine, which is currently 31 March, so that trusts have more time to continue their efforts to persuade the still-unvaccinated to get jabbed, which has helped boost the overall immunisation rate in the NHS. “Encouraging people to get vaccinated is the best way to boost vaccine take-up. Nursing staff, who are well-placed to understand people’s concerns and are highly trusted by them, have led the Covid-19 vaccination programme and have a key role to play in addressing any concerns people may have about being vaccinated.” Gill Walton, the chief executive of the RCM, warned Javid that his insistence on mandatory vaccination has “opened a Pandora’s box of unforeseen consequences”. She said: “I appeal to the health secretary to reconsider his decision and to delay the implementation. Throughout the pandemic, maternity staff have fought to keep services open and to provide the best care to women and families. It has been unrelenting and so it’s no surprise that staff absence is currently at its highest in the pandemic so far. “Moving forward with mandatory vaccination could only see staffing levels fall further. The government has opened a Pandora’s box of unforeseen consequences – but there is an opportunity now to close it. We are urging Sajid Javid to do just that,” Walton added. “Levels of vaccination in the NHS are high and rising and we should be using discussion, persuasion and education to increase vaccination among NHS staff, not the hammer blow of mandating it.” Significantly, the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital trusts in England, made clear it believed that the policy is being introduced at undue haste and would deepen already major staffing problems. “NHS leaders support the requirement that staff who are in regular contact with patients be vaccinated against Covid-19”, said Danny Mortimer, its deputy chief executive. “Both the risks and consequences of a mandatory approach were highlighted by leaders at the time of consultation, and they would have preferred to have had longer to meet these requirements. “As the deadline approaches some frontline staff will have to leave their present roles if they continue to decline to be vaccinated. This will reduce frontline NHS staff numbers even further and lead to more gaps in capacity at a time of intense pressure and patient demand”, he added. However, the Department of Health and Social Care defended the policy. A spokesperson said: “NHS and care staff do amazing work and we are thankful to those who have chosen to get the vaccine. “Health and social care workers are responsible for looking after some of the most vulnerable people in society, many of whom are more likely to suffer serious health consequences if exposed to the virus. “This is about patient safety, and ensuring people in hospital or care have as much protection as possible. Vaccinations remain our best defence against Covid-19.”",News/Society,Sajid Javid urged to delay mandatory jabs for NHS staff in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/sajid-javid-urged-to-delay-mandatory-jabs-for-nhs-staff-in-england
1/13/2022,"In Wendy Sherman, the Biden administration has sent its most experienced negotiator into the fray, in an attempt to fend off a Russian invasion of Ukraine and a new conflict in Europe. No one in government has spent more time in high-stakes talks with hostile states than the 72-year-old deputy secretary of state, who has represented the US at two rounds of critical discussions with Russia this week.  She was part of an extraordinary mission 23 years ago, led by the former defence secretary William Perry, to try to do a deal with North Korea. For many North Koreans, it was the first time they had seen an American, and the regime went all-out to put on a show of a joyfully contented country. At one point, a bus stopped in front of the delegation, seemingly by chance, and its passengers poured out and went straight into a dance routine. “Everything was supposed to be ‘spontaneous’,” Sherman later told the Guardian. “And there was a cameraman following everything we did with a 1950s hand-cranked camera. It was all rather surreal. “When we wanted to talk, we walked outside, even knowing there might be bugs in the trees. When we wanted to get a message across and were not sure who we should be talking to, we would sit in a waiting room and speak, knowing we were being listened to.” Sherman did not set out to be a diplomat. She was an activist first, working as a social worker in Baltimore, trying to make affordable housing more available. After jobs as a staffer in Congress and the Democratic National Committee, she ran Emily’s List, an organisation committed to raising funds for pro-choice Democratic women’s candidates. That background combined with her deep involvement in negotiating the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, have made her the subject of deep Republican suspicion. But her experience and cool demeanour won over enough Republicans to win Senate confirmation as deputy secretary of state, by 56 votes to 42. While the former secretary of state John Kerry would fly in at critical moments of the Iranian talks, it was Sherman who led the day-to-day negotiations for the US – a feat of stamina as the discussions frequently went deep into the night. Laura Rozen, who covered the Iran nuclear talks from beginning to end and who now writes the Diplomatic Substack newsletters, recalls a European diplomat observing that, while the Iranians got on better with Kerry, Sherman was seen as the more effective negotiator. “What I think about a lot, watching Sherman doing high-stakes [nuclear] diplomacy with Iran and now with Russia, is her mantra, that the skills are transferrable,” Rozen said. “She trained as a social worker and came into foreign policy through Democratic party politics … and now, as a 72-year-old grandmother, Sherman is working with her former Russian counterpart in the Iran nuclear deal talks [Russian Deputy FM Sergey Ryabkov], to see if the US/transatlantic alliance and Russia can agree on diplomatic solutions to avert war and preserve European peace and security.” The short silver hair and metal-rimmed glasses add to her reputation as a steely, no-nonsense negotiator, but her friend Douglas Rediker, an economist who was formerly the US representative on the executive board of the International Monetary Fund, insists that there is a softer side, that also enhances her skills as a negotiator. “It’s trite but she is tough as nails, she is smart as a whip and she is also enormously human,” Rediker said. “There are some people who are extremely tough and experienced to the point where they are so cynical, that they lose the element of humanity. “Wendy can act like and think like a person as well as someone simply espousing the mandate that she’s been given.”",News/US news,Wendy Sherman: US turns to its veteran negotiator to safeguard peace in Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/12/wendy-sherman-us-veteran-negotiator-ukraine-europe
1/13/2022,"Prince Andrew faces the prospect of giving evidence in a high-profile trial after a New York judge refused to throw out a civil case over allegations he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre when she was 17 years old. Legal experts said the Duke of York has “no good options left” after he failed to have Giuffre’s case against him dismissed, with Manhattan federal court judge Lewis Kaplan rejecting his motion “in all respects”.  The ruling could see Andrew, who strenuously denies the allegations, divulging aspects of his personal life in open court this autumn. One option of avoiding such a sensational trial would be for the duke to reach an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre, possibly costing him millions, though there are suggestions she would want her day in court. Such an agreement could cause monumental reputational damage for the monarchy, however, with the duke already forced to step back from public life. The news is a very unwelcome development for the royal family, coming just three days after full details of the celebrations for the Queen’s platinum jubilee in June were revealed. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, saying: “We would not comment on what is an ongoing legal matter.” In his 46-page detailed ruling, Kaplan rejected the argument put by Andrew’s legal team that Giuffre had waived her right to sue him under a previously secret $500,000 (£360,000) settlement she made with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre alleges Epstein trafficked her to have sex with several people, including Andrew. In the conclusion of his written ruling, Kaplan said: “For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint or for a more definite statement is denied in all respects. “Given the court’s limited task of ruling on this motion, nothing in this opinion or previously in these proceedings properly may be construed as indicating a view with respect to the truth of the charges or counter-charges or as to the intention of the parties in entering into the 2009 agreement.” Outlining his reasons for denying the motion, Kaplan said the court was not able at this stage to consider the duke’s efforts to cast doubt on Giuffre’s claims or whether he was covered by the settlement agreement, suggesting these were issues for a trial. He said: “The 2009 agreement cannot be said to demonstrate, clearly and unambiguously, the parties intended the instrument ‘directly’, ‘primarily’, or ‘substantially’, to benefit Prince Andrew.” Giuffre’s lawyer David Boies said his client “wants to achieve justice” rather than focusing on any one person. Speaking to Sky News, he said: “She has been on a campaign to try and expose sex trafficking and the evils of sexual abuse – I think that is much more important than any individual involved in this. The key individuals are Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. I think the participants in the sex trafficking are also people that need to be held to account. “How they will be held to account, I think will vary from person to person. What is justice in an individual case will vary but I think it is a combination of those things that she is seeking.” Andrew’s options now are stark and unattractive, according to legal observers. Nick Goldstone, head of disputes resolution at Ince, said: “The ruling dismissing Prince Andrew’s strike-out applications is very thorough and comprehensive. The applications appear to have done the prince more harm than good.” The duke can seek a settlement out of court, though a settlement with no admission of liability could be costly, and Giuffre may not wish to settle. He can also contest the case, but that means giving a deposition under oath – possibly giving oral evidence – during which he will be quizzed on highly personal matters. He can also default, effectively ignoring the court case, but that would lead to a finding against him. Media lawyer Mark Stephens, of Howard Kennedy, told the BBC: “Andrew’s got no good options now. He can’t make things better so, essentially, I think he’s either going to have to engage in the trial process or he’s going to have to settle, and that may well be his least worst option.” If he decides to contest, legal observers said the duke would be advised to testify, though he cannot be compelled to do so. If he were to decline, “from a presentational perspective, that would not look good”, said Goldstone. Andrew could file for a motion of reconsideration on Kaplan’s ruling, or he could take an appeal straight to the second circuit court of appeals. Any appeal would delay proceedings. The duke is in the process of selling his £18m Swiss ski chalet amid speculation he requires the money for legal fees. If the case proceeds to full trial, it could see him forced to call witnesses, which could include members of the royal family, in particular his daughter Princess Beatrice. He maintained in his disastrous 2019 BBC Newsnight interview that, on the evening cited by Giuffre, he went with Beatrice to a late-afternoon children’s party at a Pizza Express in Woking. After the party, he claims, he was at home with his children all night. The ruling deals yet another blow to the embattled prince, whose reputation and standing within the royal family has already been tarnished by his friendships with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. He withdrew from public duties soon after the Newsnight interview, which failed to draw a line under his relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who counted former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump in his circle. Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail after his July 2019 arrest on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell, 60, the daughter of the late British press titan Robert Maxwell, was found guilty of five counts for luring girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s world for him to sexually abuse. Giuffre has claimed that the prince was “sweating profusely all over me” at a London nightclub on a night when they allegedly had a sexual encounter. Andrew said in his BBC interview that Giuffre’s statement about his perspiration could not be true, claiming: “I have a peculiar medical condition which is that I don’t sweat or I didn’t sweat at the time.” As part of Giuffre’s suit, her legal team has requested documents that would prove whether or not Andrew can sweat.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew faces trial after judge refuses to dismiss Giuffre case,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/prince-andrew-faces-trial-after-judge-refuses-to-dismiss-giuffre-case
