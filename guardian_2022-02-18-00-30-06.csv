2/18/2022,"Conservative MPs have warned of a parliamentary backlash following steps taken by the government to ease tensions with China, designed to pave the way towards better trading relations. Over the past few weeks, Boris Johnson has quietly signalled a thaw in frosty relations since the decision in 2020 to exclude Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from the UK’s 5G network.  His communications chief, Guto Harri, is a former spinner for Huawei, though his previous chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, had also been an advocate of mending relations. The prime minister has ordered a restart of the UK-China Joint Economic and Trade Commission [Jetco] and this year Rishi Sunak is understood to be on the verge of agreeing the return of annual trade summit, the 11th UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD), which has not been held since 2019. “The Treasury cannot shake the orthodoxy that we must have better trading terms with China,” one senior source said. “But it is Downing Street who really wants this. Boris has always been uneasy about having to cancel Huawei.” The EFD has previously been used to announce lucrative commercial contracts and closer trade cooperation but a Treasury source played down the significance of the return of the EFD, “if it goes ahead at all”, and said it would be a chance for dialogue rather that leading to any major changes. The source said it was wrong to portray Sunak as the driving force. “It’s the chancellor’s view that our principles should guide our relationship with China. We need to be eyes wide open about their increasing international influence and must take a principled stand on issues that conflict with our own values.” The move to defrost relations with Beijing is understood to be a source of tension between Johnson and his foreign secretary, Liz Truss. “Liz is a proper China hawk,” another senior government source said. Truss is scheduled to meet the delegation of MPs who were banned from China for lobbying for sanctions to oppose the Uyghur genocide in the coming days. The UK’s trade deficit with China has more than tripled in the last year, importing £40.5bn more from China than it exported to the country. Any significant change of approach threatens to reopen splits with backbenchers, especially those who have been blacklisted by Beijing and who are understood to feel they have received no tangible support from government, including on crucial issues like cybersecurity. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former cabinet minister, said it “beggars belief that we are about to re-invent the failed project kowtow” and blamed the Treasury and Downing Street for an overeagerness to normalise relations. “Whether it is the CCP’s illegal seizure and militarisation of the South China seas or the trashing of the Sino/British agreement on Hong Kong, the Treasury seems ready to turn a blind eye to it all.” There is also continued frustration about Johnson’s stonewalling over the appointment of Tim Loughton, one of the MPs banned from China, to the chair of the Conservative Human Rights commission. The body had been a leading internal Tory pressure group, particularly on Hong Kong which led to its blacklisting by Beijing, but Johnson has declined to approve Loughton as chair for more than a year. Its previous chair, Fiona Bruce, resigned after being appointed a special envoy on religious freedom by Johnson. Loughton has been a strong critic of the prime minister’s conduct over “partygate” as well as the cut to international aid. The rights activist Benedict Rogers, the commission’s deputy chair, is understood to have privately expressed deep frustration at the impasse. Rogers declined to comment. Another source from inside the group said they were “deeply troubled about this government’s commitment to freedom and human rights, the rule of law and democracy”. Other MPs who have been sanctioned include Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Nus Ghani, the former transport minister who has been a leading campaigner on Uyghur genocide, and Neil O’Brien, the Levelling Up minister. The sanction came after their campaign to insert a clause in the trade bill, which would have permitted the high court to make a preliminary ruling on whether genocide was occurring in a potential trading partner, a clause design to put barriers on a trade deal with China. Loughton, MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, said the government should be aware of a significant parliamentary backlash to any change of approach towards China. “Parliament has made it very clear that a government guilty of genocide needs to be treated with extreme caution and cannot be welcomed as an equal partner,” he said. “It would be an insult to parliament if the government were to ignore our concerns not least when seven Parliamentarians remain sanctioned simply for speaking the truth and standing up to China’s bullying and abuse.” Bob Seeley, who will lead a backbench debate on China next week, said: “We need to engage, but we have to engage as much on our own terms as possible and was understanding the risks of doing so. “I think we have not yet got our heads around these new authoritarian states and both the obvious threats they pose but also the more subtle threats they pose. We are trying to have business as normal. The world has changed. You’re not a sabre-rattler or a war monger for stating what everyone can see.”",News/Politics,Tory MPs warn of backlash against easing of UK-China trade,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/tory-mps-backlash-easing-uk-china-trade-uyghur-genocide
2/18/2022,"The singer Britney Spears has shared a letter she received from two members of the US House of Representatives inviting her to Congress to talk about her long-running legal battle over her conservatorship that ended with victory in November. “I was immediately flattered and at the time I wasn’t nearly at the healing stage I’m in now,” Spears, 41, said in the Instagram post about the letter she received in December from Congressmen Charlie Crist of Florida and Eric Swalwell of California.  “I’m grateful that my story was acknowledged. Because of the letter, I felt heard and like I mattered for the first time in my life!!! In a world where your own family goes against you, it’s actually hard to find people that get it and show empathy.” The letter conveyed Crist and Swalwell’s congratulations to Spears and her attorney Mathew Rosengart for winning the case that ended the conservatorship of the singer’s affairs, which lasted for almost 14 years and was mostly under the direction of her father, Jamie. In an interview following her courtroom victory in December, Spears said the entire affair had left her “scared” of the music business. The House representatives said they were troubled that “for years you were unable to hire your own counsel to represent your personal and financial interests”, among other issues, and invited Spears to Congress to speak about her “empowering” story and for them to learn more of “the emotional and financial turmoil you faced within the conservatorship system”. In her post, Spears thanked the congressmen for the invitation but did not indicate if she intended to take it up. “I want to help others in vulnerable situations, take life by the balls and be brave. I wish I would have been,” she said. “Nothing is worse than your own family doing what they did to me. I’m lucky to have a small circle of adorable friends who I can count on. In the meantime thank you to Congress for inviting me to the White House [sic].” An apparently starstruck Crist responded to Spears’ post in a short video clip of his own, released on Thursday morning. “I wanted to thank Britney Spears for sharing on social media about the conservatorship and the letter that I and Eric Swalwell wrote to her to make sure she understood what was going on,” Crist said. “I’m so happy for her, glad that her conservatorship was resolved. God bless her.” Despite winning back control of her affairs, Spears is still embroiled in disputes with her family. She has threatened legal action against her sister Jamie Lynn for a tell-all book she claims contains “misleading or outrageous claims” and is “potentially unlawful and defamatory”. And in January she made new allegations of financial impropriety against her father in response to his insistence she pay his legal bills.",Arts/Music,Britney Spears invited to US Congress to discuss conservatorship legal battle,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/17/britney-spears-congress-letter-conservatorship
2/18/2022,"Thirty-five years ago Michael Fish chirpily told BBC television viewers that a woman had called in and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way. “If you’re watching,” he told the woman, “don’t worry, there isn’t.” Of course Fish was correct, it was not a hurricane. But it was an unforgettable monster of a storm that caused incredible damage and killed 18 people.  The Great Storm of 1987 took hold in the early hours of 16 October and brought winds that peaked at 120mph. It caused mayhem and devastation not seen for 250 years, including damaged buildings, major travel disruption and the uprooting of 15m trees. Numerous small boats were wrecked or blown away and a Channel ferry was blown ashore near Folkestone. The most damaged areas of the country were London, the south-east and East Anglia. In the Observer Tim Walker compared the sensational coverage of the storm - arguably justified – to Daniel Defoe’s account of England’s last great storm in 1703. Defoe wrote: “Very early in the morning there began a very great and dreadful Storm of Wind … which continued with a strange and unusual violence.” The winds caused 2,000 chimney stacks to collapse in London and ships were blown hundreds of miles off course. More than 1,000 sailors died on the Goodwin Sands off the Kent coast. Meteorologists now believe that storm was a hurricane. That is not the case with Storm Eunice, with the predicted wind speeds comparable to what can be seen in northern Scotland during a storm. But the Met Office is sufficiently concerned to give it a red weather warning. The last red weather warning was for Storm Arwen in November 2021 which caused particular chaos and heartache for the north-east of England and Scotland. The damage was much worse because, unusually, the winds came from the north. Falling trees damaged power lines leading to power cuts for about 9,000 people, some without heat and light for more than two weeks during bitterly cold weather. If it had happened in London, politicians and numerous callers to local radio argued, it would have been condemned as a national scandal with an instant visit from a concerned prime minister. Arwen, which brought a recorded wind speed of 110mph to Settle in north Yorkshire, was the worst storm in a generation for many. Before Arwen, you would have to go back to March 2018 for a similar red warning. That was during the beast from the east when the mild weather changed dramatically in the last week of February. Temperatures plunged as low as -11.7C overnight and Storm Emma prompted wind warnings for parts of south-west England and south Wales. Before then only two red weather warnings had been issued by the UK Met Office since the current system came in to force in 2011.",News/UK news,How does Storm Eunice compare with UK’s worst weather in recent history?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/how-does-storm-eunice-compare-with-uk-worst-weather-in-recent-history
2/18/2022,"Joe Biden has said the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is now “very high” as he joined Nato allies in warning that a blitz of shelling in the Donbas region may be an attempt by Russia to stage a pretext for an attack. Claims of attacks by Russian-backed separatists at several locations in Ukraine’s eastern territory, including at a kindergarten and a school, were said bear the hallmarks of an attempt to incite conflict.  The US president, speaking shortly after the expulsion of the the country’s deputy ambassador to Moscow, said his administration has “reason to believe” that Russia is “engaged in a false flag operation to have an excuse to go in.” He told reporters: “Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine.” Boris Johnson echoed the president’s statement, saying the sudden escalation of violence in Ukraine’s eastern territories may be “designed to discredit the Ukrainians”. “We fear very much that that is a thing we will see more of over the next few days,” the British prime minister said. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she was “very concerned” by Thursday morning’s development. “Reports of alleged abnormal military activity by Ukraine in Donbas are a blatant attempt by the Russian government to fabricate pretexts for invasion,” she said. “This is straight out of the Kremlin playbook.” Speaking at a meeting of Nato defence ministers, the military alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, and the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said they had long feared that Russia would look to engineer an excuse for a military incursion. Stoltenberg said: “We are concerned that Russia is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine. It is still no clarity, no certainty about the Russian tensions. “We don’t know what will happen. But what we do know is that Russia has amassed the biggest force we have seen … for decades in and around Ukraine. And we also know that there are many Russian intelligence officers operating in Ukraine. “They are present in Donbas, and we have seen attempts to stage pretext false flag operations to provide an excuse for invading Ukraine.” According to western officials, nearly half the Russian battalion tactical groups are now within 50km of the Ukrainian border as Russia continues to build its forces up on the Ukrainian border at pace. Over the past 72 hours, intelligence officials said they had seen the construction of a pontoon bridge over the River Pripyat in Belarus, and the eight kilometres from the Ukrainian border sitting inside the Chernobyl exclusion zone. The activity was said to be highly unusual and inconsistent with any past exercise. Officials said the crisis was “entering into a very dangerous phase”, adding if the shelling in the Donbas region was sustained, and played up on Russian media, the crisis will have entered a new phase. Speaking at Nato headquarters in Brussels, Austin, a retired four-star general, said that all the evidence suggested that Russia was preparing for an assault. “We’ve seen the reports of the shelling and they are certainly troubling”, he said. “We’re still gathering the details. But, you know, we’ve said for some time that the Russians might do something like this in order to justify a military conflict. So we’ll be watching this very closely.” He added: “We see them add to the more than 150,000 troops that they already have arrayed on that border. Even in the last couple of days. “We see some of those troops inch closer to that border. We see them fly in more combat and support aircraft. We see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. “We even see them stocking up their blood supplies. You know, I was a soldier myself not that long ago. And I know first hand that you don’t do these sorts of things for no reason. And you certainly don’t do them if you’re getting ready to pack up and go home.” Following the emergence of photographs showing buildings damaged by shells, separatists in the Luhansk region claimed they had been forced to return fire in response to Ukrainian shelling, describing it as a “large-scale provocation”. Kyiv disputed the claim, saying that separatists had initiated the shelling but that its forces had not fired back. A nursery building in Stanytsia Luhanska was hit, wounding two civilians, according to the Ukrainian military. Western security officials have been monitoring the shelling in Donbas closely, warning it was “the sort of provocation that has the potential to escalate,” while also stressing that exchanges of fire across the line of control in eastern Ukraine were not uncommon. An official said there was “more concern with what is happening now” than with any possible pretext for an invasion by Russia that had been set out previously. However, similar levels of hostilities have been seen previously and it was not uncommon for issues to “flash up and go away”, the source said. One western official concluded: “I’m not saying this is a pretext, but I didn’t say it wasn’t a pretext.” The development came as US officials and the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, warned that the number of Russian troops on Ukraine’s border had increased by 7,000 in just the last 48 hours, rather being drawn down. Wallace said that about 60% of Russia’s total land combat forces were now believed to around the borders of Ukraine, despite claims from Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that he was executing a “partial withdrawal”. The western alliance is now waiting on Putin’s next move. A senior US official said on Thursday that Russia had delivered its long-awaited response to American and Nato proposals about Ukraine and European security, but declined to offer any further information. The US has said it will respond to the expulsion of its deputy ambassador to Moscow, Bartle Gorman. EU leaders held a special meeting in Brussels on Thursday where they discussed the general terms of a sanctions package against Russia in the event of an invasion. Lithuania’s president, Gitanas Nausėda, said he had become particularly worried by the Russian presence in Belarus, describing the country’s president, Alexander Lukashenko, as Putin’s “puppet”. Nausėda said his concerns ranged from the possible deployment of nuclear weapons to the country to his lack of confidence in Putin’s promise to withdraw the 45,000 troops in the country at the end of an exercise on 20 February.",News/World news,Joe Biden says risk of Russian invasion of Ukraine ‘very high’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/joe-biden-says-risk-of-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-very-high
2/18/2022,"The UK’s low-carbon and renewable energy economy has failed to grow since 2014, according to official data showing a fall in the number of green jobs. In a blow to the government’s pledge to boost net-zero employment opportunities, the Office for National Statistics said its latest figures, covering 2020, showed “no significant change” in turnover and job numbers in the sector compared with six years earlier.  Employment in the low-carbon and renewable energy economy – which includes manufacturing, energy supply and construction – fell by about 28,000 across the UK over the period, to just 207,800. Among the steepest declines were in factories producing energy-efficient products, onshore wind, and solar energy. Trade unions raised questions over the government’s plan to boost Britain’s low-carbon economy after years of limited progress. Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said the UK had an opportunity to be a pioneer on the path to net zero. “But we will miss out on these opportunities if ministers do not step up public investment and action. And we could see existing jobs lost to other countries who modernise their industry faster.” Although the latest snapshot includes the first year of the coronavirus pandemic – when the British economy plunged into the deepest recession for 100 years – the figures show that in 2019, before the health emergency struck, green business turnover also fell compared with a year earlier. According to the latest data, the sector with the largest growth in jobs was in low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, where employment more than doubled to 19,100. However, this wasn’t enough to offset bigger falls elsewhere, including a decline of more than a quarter, or 32,000, in the number of jobs in energy-efficient product manufacturing. The number of green businesses operating in the UK fell by 13% over the six-year period, while the combined turnover for the low-carbon economy fell by almost 6% to £41.2bn. The ONS said the fall in turnover was largely driven by the energy-efficient products and low-emissions vehicles sectors. The majority of businesses in the low-carbon and renewable energy sectors are in manufacturing and construction, both of which suffered a downturn in 2020. However, it said employment should have been less affected than turnover because the figures included staff on furlough. While green sectors including offshore wind have recorded substantial growth in recent years, with a sharp rise in renewable energy production, critics argue that much of the activity has been driven by foreign companies, with a reliance on the UK importing turbine blades and components manufactured abroad. Boris Johnson announced an ambition in late 2020 to create 250,000 green jobs across the country through a 10-point plan, as part of a wider government drive to hit net zero and embed a green recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Ministers are seeking to encourage the growth of green jobs in sectors such as offshore wind, including through the creation of freeports in an attempt to boost investment and jobs in the low-carbon economy. However, experts and campaigners have warned that the government’s net zero plans lack the required ambition and are not backed up with adequate funding from the Treasury, instead relying on the private sector.",News/Environment,"UK green economy has failed to grow since 2014, official figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/uk-green-economy-has-failed-to-grow-since-2014-official-figures-show
2/18/2022,"Boris Johnson has claimed the shelling of a nursery school in the Donbas region of Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists was a “false-flag operation” aimed at discrediting the Ukrainian government. According to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) there were “multiple shelling incidents” on Thursday morning across the frontline in eastern Ukraine.  Three people were injured in the attack in the city of Stanytsia Luhanska, which blew a hole through the wall of a kindergarten. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Russian side of “provocative shelling”. Speaking on a visit to RAF Waddington, in Lincolnshire, the prime minister said: “Today, as I’m sure you’ve already picked up, a kindergarten was shelled in what we are taking to be – well, we know – was a false-flag operation designed to discredit the Ukrainians, designed to create a pretext, a spurious provocation for Russian action. “We fear very much that that is the kind of thing we will see more of over the next few days.” A “false-flag” incident is one in which its origin is disguised, usually in an attempt to provoke retaliation. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, had said earlier that shelling across the border indicated Moscow was carrying out “false-flag operations”, though he did not point specifically to the kindergarten shelling. Johnson said he would be travelling to Munich for the European security conference this weekend, “to talk about what we are going to do to unify the west”. He said the UK was prepared to impose tough sanctions on Russia. “There is still time for the Putin regime to step back. There is still time to avoid a catastrophe; a catastrophe for Russia, a catastrophe for Ukraine and for the world. “If Russia were so mad as to invade, I don’t think people should imagine that this would be a brief business. This would be a bloody and protracted conflict in which, I’m afraid, there will be many casualties, and including many Russian casualties.” Western security officials have been monitoring the shelling in Donbas closely, saying it was “the sort of provocation that has the potential to escalate”, while also stressing that exchanges of fire across the line of control in eastern Ukraine were not uncommon.

2/18/2022,"Prince Charles’s biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, has claimed it was “extraordinarily unlikely” the prince knew of the alleged “cash for honours” scandal, saying the idea he could have been aware “frankly beggars belief”. Dimbleby defended the heir to the throne as the Metropolitan police launched an investigation into claims the Prince’s Foundation offered to support a Saudi billionaire donor’s application for citizenship and upgrade his CBE to a knighthood.  The broadcaster and friend of the prince, who wrote Charles’s authorised biography, criticised claims it was “inconceivable” Charles would not have known of the honours offer. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “That is a very colourful thing to have said. ‘Inconceivable’ suggests that there is no possibility other than that he knew. I think it is extraordinarily unlikely that he knew. I think if he had known, he would immediately have taken action about it.” Clarence House has said the prince had “no knowledge” of the alleged scandal and was “happy to help if asked” with the police investigation, but has not been. His former close aide Michael Fawcett, who has since resigned as chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation, allegedly wrote a letter to the Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, making the offer apparently in return for a generous donation. Dimbleby said Charles believed in the honours system, understoodit, and had conducted many thousands of investitures. “If there has been some scam, some breaking of the law, you honestly think he would have been party to that? It beggars belief,” he said. He dismissed as insignificant reports in the Daily Mail that the investiture for the Saudi businessman had taken place in Buckingham Palace’s blue drawing room, which the paper said is usually reserved for world leaders, and accused it of “finding fire where there is not even any smoke”. Praising Charles’s charity work, Dimbleby said the royal was president, not a trustee or chief executive of the charity. And, though once close to Fawcett, it “does not mean that Michael Fawcett would have said to him: ‘I just want you to know that I’m thinking of offering an honour on behalf of the Foundation to a Saudi businessman.’ I mean, come off it”. He criticised parts of the media’s ability to “turn a non-bombshell into a bombshell” and compared claims Charles must have known to the smearing of the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, “for allegedly not investigating Jimmy Savile”. The former home office minister Norman Baker, who along with the campaign group Republic reported the allegations to the Metropolitan police as a possible breach of the Honours Act, believed Clarence House would be thrilled with Dimbleby’s interview. “Arise Sir Jonathan,” Baker said. He added: “When the going gets tough, Jonathan Dimbleby is rolled out to defend the prince. “The idea that Dimbleby skates over, is the ‘I know nothing’, kind of Manuel [from Fawlty Towers] response to everything. Fact is, we know Charles and Fawcett are Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Charles has said he’s the one man he cannot do without. So the idea that Fawcett would be doing stuff without Charles knowing, it is inconceivable,” Baker said. PR expert Mark Borkowski said it appeared to him that Dimbleby’s interview could demonstrate that Charles, his aides and friends “are up for a fight now”. “They are wheeling out the big guns. Because that was a peerless interview, defending Charles and attacking the Daily Mail. It shows that they are not going to take this lying down. They are not going to go back to ‘never complain, never explain’.”",News/UK news,"Unlikely Charles knew of alleged ‘cash for honours’ claims, says biographer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/prince-charles-cash-for-honours-scandal-jonathan-dimbleby
2/18/2022,"The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been accused of allowing fake news to flourish after refusing to debunk false claims that civil servants in his department demanded the removal of a portrait of the Queen. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA senior civil servants union, has claimed that Kwarteng is damaging morale within the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy after ignoring requests to publicly correct reports that staff had replaced the portrait with a smaller picture of the monarch.  The row comes amid deepening anger among civil servants that they are being unfairly and repeatedly vilified in anonymous quotes from ministerial aides. The current row in BEIS was sparked by a report in the Daily Telegraph on 1 January under the headline, “How a portrait of the Queen that is ‘the size of a stamp’ has ruffled feathers in Kwasi Kwarteng’s business department”. An official was quoted telling the newspaper: “I think some of my colleagues forget we work for her majesty’s government.” A second added: “The new picture [of the Queen] is the size of a stamp. It’s laughable really.” The article also claimed that a memorial plaque commemorating officials from the former Ministry of Power who died during the second world war had been consigned to the “basement” of the building. The report was based on anonymous quotes from sources. After BEIS staff complained about the report, senior managers met union representatives. Documents show that BEIS managers agreed that staff did not try to downgrade a portrait of the Queen or remove a remembrance plaque. However, Kwarteng has not responded to pleas to correct the record. Penman said the report upset staff, some of whom have relatives who died in the war. “You would think that Kwasi Kwarteng would be ashamed that his allies are not only spreading fake news stories about the civil service, but that they would view a remembrance plaque and a portrait of the Queen as convenient tools with which to spread false and malicious accusations,” he said. “Instead, he’s happy for these stories to run without challenge or public comment despite being asked to do so, damaging the reputation of his department and the civil servants who work there. “The irony is, of course, that those civil servants know exactly where these stories emanate from and his excuse for refusing to respond – their anonymous source – is as insulting as it is transparent. “He must understand the damage this does to morale and trust among his civil servants, all for the sake of a cheap headline.” The latest clash follows a series of claims from unions that the government is briefing against civil servants. Unions have complained that the “partygate” allegations have led to resignations by civil servants while politicians have remained in post. Priti Patel’s former senior civil servant, Sir Philip Rutnam, resigned in March 2020 claiming he had been “the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign”. Anonymous briefings to the press have also suggested that officials working from home have failed to pull their weight during the pandemic. Asked to respond to Penman’s criticisms, a BEIS spokesperson said: “The Queen is our country’s head of state and it is right that her portrait is given pride of place in government departments with sufficient prominence. Following the renovations, we are pleased to now display two portraits of her majesty in the entrance to our offices in Westminster.”",News/Politics,Kwarteng accused of letting fake news flourish over Queen portrait,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/17/kwasi-kwarteng-fake-news-flourish-queen-portrait
2/18/2022,"New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, said he was “deeply disturbed” by video of a shopping mall brawl that ended with a Black teenager pinned to the ground in handcuffs with a police officer’s knee on his back, while officers let the white youth he had been trading punches with watch from a sofa. “The appearance of what is racially disparate treatment is deeply, deeply disturbing, and another reminder that progress we’ve made on relationships between law enforcement and the communities they serve … shows that our work is not done,” Murphy said after viewing the video of the weekend altercation at the mall in Bridgewater township.  A Facebook post by the Bridgewater police department acknowledged the incident “has made members of our community upset” and said an internal investigation had been launched. The Black youth’s mother on Wednesday questioned the responding officers’ handling of the incident while the national association for the advancement of colored people (NAACP) called for the law enforcement pair to be disciplined. “If it wasn’t for race, then what is it? What made them tackle my son, not the other kid? What made them be so aggressive with my son, not the other kid? Why is the other kid sitting down, looking at my son be humiliated and put into cuffs?” the mother, named only as Ebone to protect her child’s identity, told CNN. A statement posted to Twitter by the NAACP called on Murphy and the state’s acting attorney general, Matthew Platkin, to remove the two officers from duty. “Despite years of talk about bias training and accountability … the video cannot be denied. The immediate reaction was to aggressively throw the Black child to the ground, knee placed around the neck area and cuffed behind the back,” it said. “At the same time, the white youth, at least equally at fault for the fight as his Black counterpart, was carefully eased on to a couch and treated like a victim. This is something that African Americans in New Jersey experience too often.” National outrage over police treatment of Black individuals built into historic protests following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis when a white officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of murder while his three colleagues are currently on trial for hate crimes in federal court in St Paul. The civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing the family of the Black teen in the New Jersey incident, said he was “really troubled”. “Why is it the Black kid is presumed guilty and the white kid is presumed innocent?” Crump told CNN. “The Black kid is put face down with a knee in his back and the white kid was allowed to sit on the couch and observe him being humiliated.” In an interview with local TV station ABC7, the Black youth, whose first name is Kye, said he was defending a younger friend. “My friend was arguing with the older kid, and so I kind of just jumped into a fight. And since he’s older, he was on top of me and he’s bigger. I was just confused and mad about it,” he said. “They basically tackled me to the ground, and then the male officer put his knee in my back and started putting me in cuffs. Then the female officer came over and put her knee on my upper back too while [the white youth] was just sitting down on the couch watching the whole thing.”",News/US news,Police stop brawl by letting white youth sit on sofa as Black teen is handcuffed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/new-jersey-brawling-teenagers-black-white
2/18/2022,"“What sound does my body make?” is a question that has followed Briony Greenhill since she was a child in Suffolk, sitting and singing on the stairs of the family home. It’s there today in her work as one of the world’s leading proponents of collaborative vocal improvisation (CVI) and, too, in the power and intimacy of her new album, Crossing the Ocean. “These voices that we have are part of our human design,” she says. “There’s a beauty in bringing that out and making music with it.” Vocal improvisation is different to other forms of singing. There is no song, no score, no lyrics. “When you’re not given a song, and you end up learning to trust the song that comes through you in the moment, it’s like finding the rubber ring you can trip down the river on,” Greenhill says.  In CVI, groups improvise together. “You’re a channel for the music, the moment, the air. I’m grounded and I’m hollow, and these bigger energies are coming through me. You’re allowing the song to use you as a vessel.” As a child, Greenhill took singing lessons that moulded her voice to fit pop, jazz and musical theatre styles, which she describes as “putting these techniques on to my voice from outside”. At 20, she met a woman who was teaching the basics of Indian classical vocals at a festival. “You just sing one note,” she says. “You can do it for an hour – it’s a vocal meditation.” It was “about breathing feeling into your body”. Finding this technique calming, Greenhill started doing it most days. During a decade in which Greenhill studied political science and worked for thinktanks and NGOs, music took a backseat: she played singer-songwriter gigs around London and took occasional session work. At almost 30, she felt something needed to change and she travelled to India, where she attended a classical violin concert that would prove transformative. There was something in the violinist’s unstructured, improvised playing that reminded Greenhill of the joy she had found singing as a child. After the concert, she asked if he would be her music teacher. “Well, I teach violin,” he said. “But I want to be your teacher, so I’m going to pretend you’re a violin and get on with it.” Learning to sing like a violin wasliberating. “What I’ve found often in music education as a singer is that you don’t get treated like a musician,” says Greenhill. “It’s about lyrics, appearance, your vibe. It’s not about music theory the way it is for instrumentalists. But in India I studied melody and rhythm like a violinist, I asked my voice to find a higher standard of agility and precision and musical excellence.” Greenhill continued her studies in France, under David Eskenazy, and in the US with Bobby McFerrin and the vocalist and performance artist Rhiannon. “It was like ‘Learn Bach preludes in C! Transcribe Wes Montgomery guitar solos and then just sing them!’” she says. “And that was thrillingly next-level.” It can be hard to let go into this way of working. In the making of Crossing the Ocean, Greenhill collaborated with several classically trained musicians – including the composer Simon Dobson – and was struck by how cerebral their music seemed. “Because that’s not where this music comes from – it comes from the body.” Later this year, Greenhill will launch the UK’s first CVI festival. She has already produced a vocal improvisation app, Your Song, and regularly leads courses in the UK and California. “At the start, everyone is nervous,” she says. “But I feel like I have the best job, because people’s voices are so beautiful. They’re this rich garden with all these different plants and flowers in it. And often through fear, or lack of use, those flowers get hidden. So I feel like a gardener. And I have tools and methods to help the flowers come out.” There are often tears. “People go a funny colour and keel over sideways, because the voice is down there quite deep in the heart,” Greenhill says. “I think our modern life is so busy and pressurised, and you just carry on. But when you don’t carry on, and you reach inside for your voice, what comes up with it are things you’ve been pushing down in order to carry on. So you can excavate some of the grief that’s in the heart.” Last summer, Greenhill found herself back in California, singing in collaboration for the first time since the start of the pandemic. It brought up her own grief, of course, but it was a homecoming, too. “Being back on stage, and being back with people, and singing again …” she says, “I realised I had forgotten who I was. I had forgotten why I’m alive.” Crossing the Ocean is out on 25 February",Arts/Music,‘People go a funny colour and keel over’: Briony Greenhill on leading the world’s most intense singing lessons ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/17/briony-greenhill-singing-lessons-collaborative-vocal-improvisation-hearts
2/18/2022,"From the “boing” of a minke whale to the “drum” of a red piranha, scientists are documenting more sounds in our world’s oceans, rivers and lakes every year. Now, a team of experts wants to go a step further and create a reference library of aquatic noise to monitor the health of marine ecosystems. The Global Library of Underwater Biological Sounds, “Glubs”, will include every “thwop”, “muah” and “boop” of a humpback whale as well as human-made underwater sounds and records of the geophysical swirl of ice and wind, according to a paper in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution.  Of the roughly 250,000 known marine species, scientists think all 126 mammals emit noise. At least 100 invertebrates and 1,000 of the world’s 34,000 known fish species are known to make noise, but experts believe many more sounds are waiting to be discovered and identified. By bringing together existing libraries of fish, frogs and other marine species, it is hoped the library will help identify the lullabies, chants and anthems of aquatic ecosystems. Some fish species appear to develop geographic dialects, while the calls of blue whales are known to evolve through time. “The world’s most extensive habitats are aquatic, and they’re rich with sounds produced by a diversity of animals,” says lead author Miles Parsons of the Australian Institute of Marine Science. “With biodiversity in decline worldwide and humans relentlessly altering underwater soundscapes, there is a need to document, quantify and understand the sources of underwater animal sounds before they potentially disappear.” In the examples given by experts, Madagascar’s skunk anemonefish produces different fighting sounds to those in Indonesia. Fin whale calls differ among populations in the north and southern hemispheres and over seasons, while those of pilot whales are similar worldwide. Existing websites such as FishSounds and FrogID already host an inventory of aquatic noise. But it is hoped a single platform would enable the use of artificial intelligence identification of unknown noises while also allowing scientists to monitor the health of reefs, open ocean and freshwater ecosystems. Under the proposals, the public would be able to contribute their own underwater recordings. “Collectively, there are now many millions of recording hours around the world that could potentially be assessed for a plethora of both known and, to date, unidentified biological sounds,” said Jesse Ausubel, one of the founders of the International Quiet Ocean Experiment (IQOE) and a scientist at the Rockefeller University. Monitoring noise underwater has been used to study the effect of hurricanes and how prey change their behaviour near predators, and to document the migration patterns of great whales. Many fish and invertebrate species are nocturnal, often making audio monitoring the only viable study method. “Human song varieties include love and work songs, lullabies, chants, and anthems,” said Ausubel. “Marine animals must sing love songs. Maybe AI applied to the global library can help us understand the lyrics of these and many others.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Fish love songs and fighting talk: underwater sound library to reveal language of the deep ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/underwater-sound-library-to-reveal-language-of-the-deep-aoe
2/18/2022,"Hello and happy Thursday, The most fundamental concept in American government is that all politicians are accountable to the people. Constituents accept laws shaped by the people they vote for, knowing that they have the power to eventually vote them out of office if they disagree.  But when it comes to the US House of Representatives, this pillar of democracy is crumbling. An overwhelming majority of seats in the US House are becoming non-competitive. That means that when voters show up at the polls in November to vote for their candidates, the contests will already be decided. Their votes won’t matter. It felt strange writing that as the opening to a story we published last weekend exploring the decline of competitive congressional seats. How could voters’ choices not matter in an American election? But academics, analysts and other experts say the trend is undeniable. Just 27 of the 335 congressional districts that have been drawn so far as part of the redistricting process are considered competitive – meaning either party has less than a five-point advantage – according to FiveThirtyEight. Dave Wasserman, an elections expert for the non-partisan Cook Political Report, told me he expects there to be 30 to 35 competitive seats in total once states finish drawing all 435 district boundaries. That means that as many as 94% of representatives would be running in relatively safe seats – a figure that astonished me. Why is this happening? Some of the decline in competitive seats is due to natural geographic clustering of likeminded voters. That clumping means that when states draw new lines, it’s harder to draw competitive districts. In 2012, there were 66 competitive districts, Wasserman noted. By 2020, under the same set of lines, there were 51. But politicians are undoubtedly accelerating the decline in competition by distorting district lines to their advantage. As redistricting has unfolded this year, elected officials made aggressive efforts to change district lines to shore up incumbents, locking in their seats for several more years. The clearest example of this happened in Texas, where Republicans, who have complete control over the redistricting process, reduced the number of competitive districts from 12 to one . The decline in competition has huge consequences. No longer worried about a general election, politicians become more worried about fending off challengers in a party primary. That disincentivizes bipartisan compromise and incentivizes playing to their party’s base. “This will further increase polarization … it’s also a reflection of polarization, but it’ll also entrench polarization more deeply,” Richard Pildes, a law professor at New York University, told me. “They will do even more of what we know they already do, which is tack to the more extreme wings in order to try and fight off potential primary challengers to protect themselves on that flank.” The lack of competition can have consequences beyond congressional races, said Amanda Litman, the co-founder and executive director of Run for Something, which focuses on down-ballot contests. She noted that the Democratic party focuses its resources in battleground states where there are competitive congressional districts. Fewer competitive districts, she said, would mean fewer resources. “The fewer competitive elections there are, the fewer places that will be able to have concentrated effort and intentionality around [races],” she told me. Thinking about competitive districts also caused me to rethink what constituted a “fair” electoral map. A state that is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans – with 10 congressional districts, for example – could draw five safe Republican districts and five safe Democratic ones. Would that map be fair? Would it be fairer than one that has three safe districts for each party and four competitive districts? I posed this question to Pildes. He said that politicians tended to favor the former approach. “One reason parties don’t like competitive seats is that if the districts are all 3% to 4% predicted to go in one particular direction, they can all flip in a single election. Whereas if they’re plus-nine for one party, a three-point shift isn’t gonna do anything,” he said. “The value of competitive districts gets sort of short shrift in the political process because there’s not a lot of political self-interest in creating competitive districts.” Also worth watching … Texas election officials are seeing a staggeringly high number of mail-in ballots rejected ahead of the state’s 1 March governor’s primary. Amy Weirich, a Tennessee prosecutor, defended a six-year prison sentence for Pamela Moses, who tried to register to vote while ineligible. A federal judge blocked a portion of a new Texas law that made it a crime for election officials to solicit mail-in ballots. Texas is appealing the ruling. Florida Republicans are considering adopting a new measure that would make it harder to vote by mail, potentially causing headaches for at least 400,000 voters in the state.",News/US news,"Thanks to new congressional maps, most Americans’ votes won’t matter",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/17/newly-drawn-district-lines-safe-seats-congress
2/18/2022,"The Queen should abdicate: this is the right time. Not because another scandal has broken out, with police probing Saudi cash-for-honours donations to the Prince of Wales’s charity. Not because of Prince Andrew’s disgrace. Nor should she abdicate for the reason given this week by my friend and colleague Simon Jenkins: he calls for her to withdraw gently from public life to spend her declining years in dignified tranquility, and allow a “planned transfer” to Charles. In other words, let there be no perilous moment when people ask themselves why no one asked them first. Allow no possible pause for thought between her last breath and the shout of “vivat rex”. Make sure it’s a fait accompli with his royal posterior already cemented to the throne.  It is indeed a good time to bow out gracefully, as this platinum jubilee celebrates her 70-year reign with all the pomp of a four-day bank holiday and a new pudding. But let it mark an end to monarchy itself, those feudal centuries drawing to a peaceful close. The Queen has held the monarchy together skilfully through tempestuous scandals, from the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the divorces of three of her children to the flight of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, once heralded as royals for the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo era. This jubilee would make a cheerful ending to all the royal folderol. What better time to return the sovereignty promised in Brexit to the people to whom it belongs. Elizabeth the Last should get a historic send-off, her golden coach and crown retired and her six palaces opened as fine museums. (No, tourism is no excuse for monarchy: Versailles gets many more visitors, and so does Legoland down the road from Windsor Castle). In death or abdication, her passing will be an emotive memory marker in every family, the last link to the second world war, to remnants of empire and to that old black and white world of Pathé newsreels with their jolly jingo voices. “Thank God for the Queen”, proclaims the Sun’s front page today, absurdly. It’s doubtful she returns any thanks to Rupert Murdoch, whose lèse-majesté arrival here shattered that old reverence for royal mystique. The crown and constitution are no longer abstract debates. The need for an elected president has become urgent now Boris Johnson’s arrival in Downing Street tests conventions, laws and civil rights beyond their limits. John Major expressed that constitutional outrage eloquently on these pages, listing Johnson’s abuses: deliberately breaking international law; tearing up the ministerial code; ordaining police stop and search “without any cause for suspicion”; removing British citizenship at whim, while waging war against the civil service and the BBC, those national safeguards. The Commons Speaker turns out to be powerless against lies told to his face. There is no voice to admonish, check or protect against elective dictatorship by a wrecker of a prime minister with a strong majority. His MPs are shockingly derelict. Until now, monarchy was defended as dignified and powerless, a harmless decoration that never interferes with parliament. Embarrassing lapses – the Guardian’s revelations of the Queen’s consent preventing laws that may reveal her wealth or Charles’s “spider letters” leaning on ministers – are relatively trivial. The constitutional problem is not the monarch’s power, but powerlessness. Presidents around Europe protect constitutions and guard against overmighty politicians breaking basic law. A president would have stopped Johnson illegally proroguing parliament: it takes the authority of election to take action as a vital backstop in a constitutional emergency. Our monarchy has handed all royal prerogative to the prime minister with no check or balance, bar a House of Lords almost as weak as the monarch for the same bad reason – lacking the authority of election. Look how Johnson engages in voter suppression: his proposals for compulsory photo ID and abolishing colleges registering their students will deliberately deter the young and poor from voting. Look how he moves to curb the electoral commission’s power to prosecute illegal political donations protecting his own party’s pelf. There is no brake on an errant prime minister in a country without a written constitution, where a warped electoral system denies fair representation and there is no effective head of state to guard against law-breaking. The unelected Queen must do what the prime minister tells her to. Monarchists speak with revulsion of who an elected president may be. The royal historian Robert Lacey, in a recent debate, asked in tones of horror, “President Lineker? President Street-Porter?” But, urges Graham Smith, CEO of the Republic pressure group, look around Europe at dignified presidents who understand their ceremonial duties and the political limits to their role, while acting as constitutional guarantors. Former politicians take on a presidency with as much independence as our Speakers in parliament. Look across the Irish Sea at Michael D Higgins, Mary McAleese or Mary Robinson and ponder why British voters are too wild or daft to be trusted to make equally sensible choices. Support for this antique dysfunction wanes with each generation and it has become fragile. A majority of under-25s expect it to be gone in 25 years. Monarchy is a cast of mind blocking reform. Monarchy is a feudalism of the imagination that stamps approval on inheritance, inequality and privilege, all growing rampantly right now. “Take but degree away, untune that string, And, hark, what discord follows!” Shakespeare has Ulysses warn, eulogising “degree, priority and place” in Troilus and Cressida: no one knows if this deep conservatism aligning the planets with aristocratic order was his own view. The point is this: that string is untuned already. The crown decorates a riot of constitutional disorder. Abolishing it would open windows into every aspect of how we choose to be governed and how we think of ourselves.

2/18/2022,"Rail firms are warning passengers to avoid travel on Friday, when the worst storm in three decades is forecast to hit the UK. Journeys across Britain will be affected by speed restrictions and delays on Friday, the rail industry said, as Storm Eunice is expected to cause major disruption.  Winds of up to 90mph are forecast for parts of the UK, according to red and amber weather warnings issued by the Met Office. Long-distance train operators cancelled many services in advance and said passengers should use tickets booked for Friday to travel on Thursday or Saturday instead. Network Rail will be imposing speed restrictions of 50mph across most of the railway for safety reasons, to minimise the risk from fallen trees or debris blown on to the track. Engineers will be out in force for the second time in three days to combat damage from the extreme weather. Train services in Scotland, which bore the worst impact of Storm Dudley on Wednesday, had largely resumed by 10am on Thursday after a cleanup operation to repair overhead lines and remove fallen trees. Network Rail said additional engineers would be deployed ready to tackle problems as they arise, and to check all affected lines for damage before reintroducing services as quickly as possible. Transport for Wales told passengers to expect disruption and to avoid travel, with Eunice expected to be “the largest and most impactful storm affecting Wales for many years”. The mainline to Cardiff will be closed west of Bristol on Friday. Great Western Railway, which operates the south Wales mainline and across the south-west regions, is expected to be most affected by Eunice. The firm said customers could use tickets up to and including Monday, adding that it expected to significantly reduce all its long-distance services and close branch lines in Devon and Cornwall. LNER, which runs trains on the east coast mainline between London and Scotland, said customers should expect disruption and could claim a refund if they preferred not to risk travel. Avanti, which runs trains from London to Glasgow, said it would operate a drastically reduced timetable, with only one train every two hours between Euston station and Birmingham. CrossCountry has advised people not to travel on both Friday or Saturday, with a strike affecting services at the weekend. ​Jacqueline Starr, the chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, an industry body, said: “Rail companies are working hard to keep people moving safely but journeys will be disrupted, especially on Friday. We’re asking people to plan their travel for a different day if possible or to check and recheck before they travel.” Jake Kelly, a director at Network Rail, said: “We will be doing everything we can to keep as many services as possible running safely and reliably on Friday, but with such strong winds expected we know that disruption to passengers’ journeys is inevitable.” Transport for Greater Manchester urged people to only make strictly necessary journeys on Friday, saying that flying debris could block Metrolink tram services. Britain’s biggest airlines, easyJet and British Airways, said they were monitoring the situation as the storm approached, but neither has cancelled services as yet. Eunice will be more widespread, and comes at the end of a half-term break for many, when higher numbers than usual of families and skiers will be returning from holidaying abroad.",News/UK news,Storm Eunice: rail firms urge people to avoid travel on Friday,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/17/storm-eunice-rail-firms-urge-people-to-avoid-travel-on-friday
2/18/2022,"Concerns have been raised around access to Covid jabs for young children after it was suggested they are unlikely to be offered as part of school vaccination programmes in England. On Tuesday, it was announced that all children aged five to 11 in England will be offered a Covid vaccine, following advice from the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Similar announcements have been made for Wales and Scotland, with Northern Ireland having confirmed it will do the same.  The Guardian understands that details of the vaccine rollout are still being finalised but, in England at least, a schools-based programme is not likely to be the primary route. Instead, the jabs will be offered from April at pharmacies, vaccination centres and, where appropriate, at GP surgeries. The plans appear to be rooted in concerns that provision of the jabs in schools could disrupt other vaccination programmes. “School-based deployment will draw on many of the same resources required for the delivery of other routine immunisation programmes, including for HPV, MenACWY (meningitis) and MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), coverage of which was affected over the last two years because of the pandemic,” the JCVI has noted. There may also be other considerations. “In principle school programmes would represent an excellent opportunity to reach the target group, but I am not sure how comfortable, especially the younger children – and their parents – would be to receive an injection without (a) parent being present, and this needs to be explored with families,” said Beate Kampmann, professor of paediatric infection and immunity, and director of thevaccine centre at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Dr Simon Williams, a behavioural scientist at Swansea University, said he supported plans not to offer Covid vaccinations to five- to 11-year-olds in schools, noting a survey from the Office for National Statistics which found only six in 10 parents of children in that age bracket said they were likely to have their child vaccinated. “The downside to it being offered through schools is that some parents might feel like this puts undue pressure on their decision, or might feel that it is less optional that way,” he said, adding having to book an appointment outside of school was less likely to create a sense of division or difference between those children and parents who decided to have the vaccine and those who did not. But the plans have also raised concerns. The JCVI itself has noted that offering vaccines to children at school has previously been associated with “higher levels of vaccine coverage with less inequality as measured by ethnicity and indices of deprivation”. “[The challenge] is to make sure that those parents and children who do want the vaccine, but might find it harder to access or travel to other vaccination locations, or find time outside existing work and other commitments, are able to get it,” said Williams. “As such, making the vaccination appointments easy to book and making sure there are enough opportunities, including local and mobile sites and walk-ins, will help.” Dr Helen Salisbury, a GP in Oxford and a member of the Independent Sage committee, also raised concerns. “If we hope to make vaccines easily accessible to all families who want them, it makes sense to do the vaccination in schools which is where the children already are,” she said, although she added the school health service would need extra support to do so given vaccine programmes for older children need to continue at the same time. Salisbury added that while some GP surgeries may be able to put on further clinics for young children to be vaccinated, others may not feel they have the capacity. “The further option of mass vaccination centres is likely to limit the vaccination uptake to the most motivated families who also have access to transport, and is likely to widen inequalities,” she said. “In other age groups, we can see that the least advantaged in our society have the lowest vaccine coverage: the mode of delivery of children’s vaccines needs to be considered carefully to prevent this being duplicated in this age group.”",News/World news,Poor Covid vaccine access for children in England ‘likely to widen inqualities’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/17/limited-vaccine-access-for-children-in-england-aged-5-11-likely-to-widen-inequalities
2/18/2022,"A Tory MP who leads a group which campaigns against the government’s net zero measures has recruited two members of staff from a controversial organisation that questions climate science. After the Guardian revealed links between members of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, run by the MP Craig Mackinlay, and the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), further ties between the two organisations have been found.  Politico reported that Mackinlay, an outspoken critic of the government’s net zero policies, has taken on Harry Wilkinson, the head of policy at GWPF’s campaigning arm, Net Zero Watch, in addition to Ruth Lea, a former trustee of the arm, to work in his parliamentary office. Wilkinson is a critic of consensus on global heating, and has tweeted: “The ‘climate crisis’ is a religious belief, nothing to do with science.” He previously worked for Nigel Lawson, who founded the GWPF and makes claims such as: “I think that climate change is not a threat, it is happening very gently at a fraction of a degree per decade which is something we can perfectly well live with.” Wilkinson celebrated the news of his appointment, tweeting: “After 5 years of working as a Researcher for Lord Lawson, I am pleased to be able to take a position in Craig Mackinlay’s office. I look forward to supporting his work alongside continuing my role with Net Zero Watch.” Green campaigners have frequently called the GWPF a leading source of climate change denial, as it has questioned climate research by top scientists, called for green measures to be halted, and claimed the rising level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has many benefits. Mackinlay confirmed the additions to his team, adding that Lea, who will be working unpaid, had had a parliamentary pass through association with his office since 2016, but that she had primarily worked with him on Brexit. He told Politico her work with Net Zero Watch “was wholly unconnected to her original appointment with me and is not related to her continuation as a passholder now. She is largely retired these days and she comes to parliament infrequently.” The MP for South Thanet said Wilkinson’s continuing employment with Net Zero Watch “is fully disclosed according to parliamentary rules applying to MPs’ employees and his depth of knowledge acquired there is invaluable to my interest and work on net zero issues”. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group of 19 Tory politicians has been accused of attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, linking it to the cost of living crisis and leading to fears of a “culture war” campaign around net zero. They have recently called for fracking to be resumed and criticised the government’s plans to decarbonise industry, as well as casting doubt on plans to phase out diesel and petrol cars in favour of electric ones.
