3/16/2022,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk posted in a Twitter thread on Monday advising followers to own “physical things” when inflation is high. In the tweet, Musk said “As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high. I still own & won’t sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw.” The biggest takeaway for some followers seems to have been that Musk is still holding his Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) because the cryptocurrency’s price saw a temporary spike shortly after the tweet. However, the more important point to Musk’s message is that physical assets are generally the safest investment during times of high inflation. This message coming from the “Dogefather” himself should speak volumes. While Musk referenced owning a home, real estate, in general, performs well for investors during years of high inflation. Specifically, single-family homes, multifamily, self-storage and farmland. Running out to buy a property may not be the most feasible option for most investors right now, but luckily there are options available to buy shares of fractionalized real estate or even invest in a fund that has a portfolio of properties. Here are some ways you can buy fractional shares of these inflation-resistant properties. Single-Family Homes: The real estate crowdfunding platform Arrived Homes has made it possible for retail investors to buy shares of individual rental properties with as little as $100. The platform allows users to browse properties, similar to a real estate listing site, and simply choose which homes to invest in. Multifamily: There are multiple options to passively invest in multifamily properties through crowdfunding. Accredited investors can browse offerings on sites like CrowdStreet or RealCrowd and invest in a project with minimum investments starting at $25,000. Options are a little more limited for non-accredited investors, but CalTier Realty has a multifamily fund with a minimum investment of only $500. Self-Storage: The real estate crowdfunding platform RealCrowd currently has an offering for a self-storage portfolio, Reliant Self-Storage Fund III, with a minimum investment of $50,000. (read offering announcement) Farmland: Agricultural land may be one of the best long-term real estate plays available right now. Farmland acreage is shrinking across the country at a rate of over 1 million acres per year, while the global demand for food is steadily rising. The farmland investing platform FarmTogether recently launched a new offering for an organic vineyard in California, with a minimum investment of $15,000 (read offering announcement) Interested in exploring more real estate offerings?

3/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Stocks surged Wednesday and U.S. futures climbed as China’s vow to stabilize battered markets lifted sentiment after weeks of worries about war and high inflation. Treasury yields rose ahead of the Federal Reserve rates decision.

Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed more than 1.5% while those on the S%P 500 crested 1%. U.S.-listed Chinese stocks soared, with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. both up at least 20% in premarket trading, while Didi Global Inc. jumped more than 40%. An Asia-Pacific share gauge advanced the most since 2020, a measure tracking mainland companies listed in Hong Kong posted the biggest gain since the global financial crisis and a Chinese tech index added a record 20%. China vowed policies to boost financial markets and spur economic growth as it attempted to ease fears over challenges related to the ailing property sector, overseas listings and a clampdown on internet firms. Equities in China and Hong Kong had been under pressure -- shedding about $1.5 trillion over the first two days this week -- in part on speculation that Beijing’s ties with Russia raise the risk of a U.S. backlash. “The market was indeed oversold, irrational, in the dramatic rout, so real money is back doing bottom fishing,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific Yamaichi. West Texas Intermediate crude oil advanced, while staying below $100 a barrel. Treasuries fell, taking 10-year and 30-year yields to the highest since 2019 ahead of the Fed decision later Wednesday. The yuan strengthened and a dollar gauge dipped. A quarter-point Fed rate increase, the first since 2018, to fight high inflation is widely anticipated but there’s less certainty beyond that. While markets expect a total of seven such moves this year, policy makers also have to factor in growth risks emanating from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “We will be closely watching the Fed’s dot plot, which we expect to signal five or six interest-rate hikes this year, more than December’s projections but in line with market expectations,” wrote Lauren Goodwin, portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments. “A dot plot projecting more hiking would likely be a hawkish signal and could result in an earlier yield curve inversion.” In the latest developments from the war, Ukraine and Russia are due to resume talks Wednesday. A key adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called the negotiations “difficult” but said there is room for compromise. In Russia, President Vladimir Putin said Ukraine’s leadership was not “serious” about resolving the conflict. Russia has begun the process of paying $117 million in interest due Wednesday on dollar bonds. The country would be in default if it doesn’t pay the coupons in U.S. currency within a 30-day grace period, according to credit assessor Fitch Ratings. The ruble strengthened in Moscow trading. Elsewhere, the London Metal Exchange halted nickel trading minutes after it started, citing a technical issue with its new daily limit, as prices plunged immediately when trading resumed after a week-long suspension.
