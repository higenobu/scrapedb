1/10/2022,"A Washington state man identified as William Cunningham is facing felony hate crime charges after video footage captured him hurling racial slurs as he threatened a Black student who was involved in an altercation with his daughter and her boyfriend. The incident in the Seattle exurb of Monroe, Washington, occurred nearly two months ago on Nov. 10, local station King 5 reported, when Cunningham’s daughter, who is white, shoved a friend of a Black male student in the hallway. According to records obtained by the station, the young man later confronted Cunningham’s daughter and her boyfriend in the school’s parking lot. Threats were exchanged, and then the incident turned physical when the boyfriend reportedly pushed the young man, who then grabbed the boyfriend’s shirt. The daughter reportedly also hit the young man in the head with a water bottle. After their initial tussle was over and the Black student was still nearby talking to friends, the daughter allegedly made a video call to her father and walked to the Black student so that her father could see his face. Video footage captured the father making death threats, telling the young man, “going to [expletive] all you [N-word] up. If I see you, I’ll kill you,” and other racial expletives, court documents stated. “He said he’s a white cracker, and he’ll [expletive] all you [N-word] up. You want to act ignorant?” she said, according to court records. Addressing her boyfriend, she added, “My dad says you got something metal in the car smack that [expletive] in his mouth right now.” In a statement, Monroe police revealed that during their investigation they learned that Cunningham and his daughter went to the Black student’s workplace and followed him around for 20 minutes. The two were eventually banned from the establishment. Cunningham reportedly admitted to the allegations. He is expected to be arraigned in Snohomish County Superior Court on Jan. 19. Earlier this week, the school district released a statement acknowledging the incident, stating: “We are horrified that someone, especially an adult, would threaten one of our students in this way. There is no place for hate in the Monroe School District, and we will take action to remove access to school sites for anyone who threatens students and staff.” The victim has since transferred out of the school.

1/10/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Iran will face severe consequences if it attacks Americans, the White House said on Sunday, including any of those sanctioned by Tehran for the 2020 killing of General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Iran's sanctions on Saturday came as Tehran's proxy militias continue to attack American troops in the Middle East. ""We will work with our allies and partners to deter and respond to any attacks carried out by Iran,"" Sullivan said in a statement. ""Should Iran attack any of our nationals, including any of the 52 people named yesterday, it will face severe consequences."" Iran on Saturday imposed sanctions https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-imposes-sanctions-americans-over-2020-killing-top-general-2022-01-08 on dozens more Americans, many of them from the U.S. military, over the 2020 killing of Soleimani. Iran's Foreign Ministry said 51 Americans had been targeted for what it called ""terrorism"" and human rights violations. The step lets Iranian authorities seize any assets they hold in Iran, but the apparent absence of such assets means it will likely be symbolic. It was not clear why Sullivan's statement referred to 52 people when Tehran said it had sanctioned 51. Iran's sanctions included U.S. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It also included former White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien. Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, the overseas arm of the elite Revolutionary Guards, was killed in Iraq in a drone strike on Jan. 3, 2020, ordered by then President Donald Trump. A year ago, Iran imposed sanctions https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-sanctions/iran-blacklists-trump-u-s-officials-as-his-term-nears-end-idUSKBN29O24F on Trump and several senior U.S. officials.

1/10/2022,"PERTH, N.Y. (AP) — A New York man and his girlfriend are accused of holding the man's estranged wife captive for days and assaulting her, including cutting off one of her fingers, before she managed to escape. The 37-year-old woman told police she was kidnapped at gunpoint by her husband on New Year's Eve and physically and sexually assaulted, fearing for her life while being held at a home and at one point a motel room, according to court papers released Friday, The Times Union of Albany reported. “Throughout the entire time I was with Justin, he was threatening to kill me and told me if I didn’t kill myself, he would kill me,” the woman told investigators, referring to her estranged husband, Justin Wilson, 31. The Associated Press doesn’t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Wilson and Nicole Elmore, 35, both of Gloversville, were arraigned Friday on charges of kidnapping, assault and sexual assault. Wilson faces four charges and Elmore faces three, and other charges are pending against both, according to Wilson's attorney Stephen Rockmacher. Both were being held at the Fulton County jail after pleading not guilty and are scheduled to appear in court Feb. 7, he said. Rockmacher said he had only spoken briefly with Wilson, whom he has previously represented in criminal and family court matters. Rockmacher said he has not yet discussed the specifics of this case with his client. “I've read the allegations. I hope they're not true,” he said. “I've not yet discussed them with Mr. Wilson.” A message was left seeking comment with Elmore's attorney, Cristopher Savino. Court papers said Wilson drove the woman, face down in back seat of an SUV, to his trailer in Perth, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Albany, where she said she was brutalized for six days, including having her pinky finger amputated and the wound burned with a flame to stop the bleeding. At one point, the woman said, Wilson and Elmore took her to a motel in nearby Amsterdam, where she said she was further assaulted, including Wilson trying to drown her in a hot tub. The woman said she escaped nearly a week later after being left inside her estranged husband's SUV while he went inside a home.",U.S./Associated Press,Man and his girlfriend are accused of brutal assault on wife,https://news.yahoo.com/man-girlfriend-accused-brutal-assault-174345174.html
