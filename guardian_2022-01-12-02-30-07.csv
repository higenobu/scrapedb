1/12/2022,"Book sales continued to climb last year despite lockdowns, with more than 212m print books sold in 2021 – the highest figure of the last decade. Driven by booming appetites for crime novels, sci-fi, fantasy, romance and personal development titles, sales last year showed an increase of 5% on 2020. The sales were worth £1.82bn – a 3% increase on 2020, and the first year on record that sales have topped £1.8bn. The figures were released on Tuesday by Nielsen BookScan, which was forced to fill in lockdown data gaps with estimates based on its monthly consumer surveys, which collect data from around 3,000 book buyers each month. Bookshops across the UK were shut for over three months at the start of 2021.  Fiction was up 20% compared with 2019, said Nielsen, propelled by 19% volume growth for the crime and thriller genre, 23% for science fiction and fantasy, and 49% for romance. Chart-topping sales for Richard Osman’s first two novels drove crime’s strong performance: The Thursday Murder Club was the year’s bestselling title, while The Man Who Died Twice was the fourth bestselling title of the year. In non-fiction, the mind, body, spirit category saw the biggest growth, up by 50% to hit a lifetime high of £18.7m. Charlie Mackesy’s “book of hope”, The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, continued to be a source of inspiration for readers as the year’s second bestselling title, revealed Nielsen, followed by Matt Haig’s The Midnight Library, an uplifting novel in which heroine Nora struggles with depression. Other strong performers include the Women’s prize winner Hamnet, by Maggie O’Farrell, and the Booker prize winner Shuggie Bain, by Douglas Stuart, with adult fiction taking nine spots in the Top 20, its highest total since 2012. Adam Silvera’s young adult novel They Both Die at the End, a favourite on TikTok, just made it into the Top 20, the first YA title to do so since 2015. “Overall, the year’s bestsellers show book buyers seeking out comfort, laughter, escapism, familiarity and maybe a sense of community, given the continued impact of social media in bringing in new authors with existing platforms and creating conversations around new and old books,” said Nielsen’s Jackie Swope. “The start of 2022 is unfortunately looking a lot like 2021, with a new variant, a rush to vaccinate and widespread uncertainty. But one thing we can be certain about: books are most definitely not a pandemic fad and have proved their lasting power time and again.” Kiera O’Brien, charts editor at The Bookseller, welcomes the growth. “It really does seem to be a re-discovered/newfound love of reading driving sales across the board. Fiction rising 20% against 2019 (for the non-lockdown weeks of 2021) is really incredible, given how sluggish fiction sales have been previously,” she said. “Of course, Osman brought in nearly £12m in the non-lockdown weeks alone, but both Hamnet and Shuggie Bain hitting the year’s top 20 bestseller list shows literary fiction is rising (and perhaps the nation’s desire to support their local indie too). “ The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman (Penguin £8.99) The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse by Charlie Mackesy (Ebury £16.99) The Midnight Library by Matt Haig (Canongate £8.99) The Man Who Died Twice by Richard Osman (Penguin £18.99) Pinch of Nom: Quick and Easy by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson (Pan Macmillan £20) Guinness World Records 2022 (Guinness World Records £20) And Away … by Bob Mortimer (Simon & Schuster £20) Megamonster by David Walliams (HarperCollins £14.99) Windswept and Interesting by Billy Connolly (John Murray Press £25) Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens (Little, Brown £8.99) Figures provided by Nielsen BookScan.",Arts/Books,UK book sales in 2021 highest in a decade,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/11/uk-book-sales-in-2021-highest-in-a-decade
1/12/2022,"Senior professionals can expect pay increases of up to 25% in the first quarter of 2022, as the economy begins to open up following the lifting of Omicron-related restrictions and companies fight to hold on to their best staff. Experienced staff with salaries of £80,000 and above across a wide range of disciplines from marketing to finance and IT are already beginning to enjoy rises of £20,000 a year or more, according to recruitment firm Robert Walters.  The hunt for talent also extends further down the pay scales as professional services companies budget for an increase in their wage bill of between 10% and 15% – the largest increase seen since 2008 and almost three times the inflation rate, the recruiter said in its 2022 UK Salary Guide. Chris Poole, the firm’s managing director, said that after a year of double-digit pay increases for new joiners, firms were under pressure to ramp up pay rates for existing staff to prevent them quitting for a rival. Business lobby groups have reported many of their members complaining of lenghtening backlogs of work made worse by a shortage of staff. The situation has been made worse by many over-50s suffering from long Covid while experienced, skilled workers have quit their jobs in search of a new challenge, dubbed the great resignation. A switch to digital commerce during the pandemic has also created a dislocation in the jobs market, stranding many people in jobs that are no longer in demand. The report found that in the past year, wages for new starters grew on average by 6% to 8%, while those professionals who moved into industries at the forefront of fighting the pandemic or meeting pandemic-related demands, such as technology or healthcare, saw pay hikes as high as 15% to 20%. “Looking at the year ahead we will see more companies raise the pay of their existing employees to sit in line with new starter salaries,” he said. Over a third of businesses (39%) said they were increasing pay to keep up with rising inflation, he added. Many companies, unable to recruit from the wider jobs market, are looking to recruit and train existing staff, which often means promoting senior executives from regional offices who refuse to move to London. “There is a lot of compromise and flexibility in the search for talent,” a spokesperson said. “So boards are allowing people to work from quite far away and making commitments that executives only need attend a proportion of meetings in person.” She said the acceleration of digital services meant that tech savvy executives who could interpret large amounts of data were “head and shoulders above the rest”. However, many workers, including some of those with in-demand skills, are starting from a low base in their search for higher wages. More than half (54%) of workers said they were expecting a pay rise this year after a two-year salary freeze. The survey also unearthed a large degree of staff dissatisfaction from their treatment by employers during the pandemic, with two-thirds saying they will leave their job if they are not rewarded fairly. Three-quarters said they were “very confident” about job opportunities in their sector this year. The report said the majority of professionals gave top priority to “excellent compensation and benefits and a bonus scheme,” while 40% put job security as their most important rquirement. “In fact, flexi-hours (29%), remote working (22%), and holiday entitlement (20%) all rank much lower in importance for professionals – perhaps because over half of white-collar workers stated that they ‘wouldn’t bother’ asking about flexi-working in a job interview in the coming year because they naturally assume ‘it is a given now’,” it said.",News/Business,Workers could see 25% pay rise as companies fight to hold on to staff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/11/workers-could-see-25-pay-rise-as-companies-fight-to-hold-on-to-staff
1/12/2022,"Tamara Rojo, the artistic director of English National Ballet and one of the biggest names in the industry, is stepping down after 10 years in the role, the company announced on Tuesday. The acclaimed dancer – who has introduced groundbreaking works into the ENB’s repertoire, including more than 40 works choreographed by women – will step down in late 2022 to take up the role of artistic director at San Francisco Ballet, where her husband, Isaac Hernández, was recently appointed a principal dancer.  Rojo has been credited with giving ENB a new, international allure, through innovative and risk-taking commissions such as Akram Khan’s Giselle. She also led ENB into a new chapter in 2019 by moving it into the RIBA award-winning Mulryan Centre for Dance in east London, several months before the pandemic hit. Since then, she’s been a strong advocate of the arts, after ENB had to furlough 85% of its workforce and many of the staff, including Rojo, took pay cuts. Later this month, she will make her choreographic and directorial debut with Raymonda, her first full-length ballet, which ENB will perform at the London Coliseum. In a recent interview with the Guardian, she spoke about turning the 1898 ballet, set during the crusades, into a new production inspired by Florence Nightingale and the Crimean war. ENB said it will appoint an Artistic Advisory Panel to support the board in the search for Rojo’s replacement. Meanwhile, Rojo will become the first woman to lead the oldest professional ballet company in the US, founded in 1933. In a statement, she said it had been “an honour” to have led ENB since 2012. “I am incredibly proud of all that we have achieved together, from the tremendous talent working within and alongside the company, to creating and moving into the amazing new building we now call our home, to the off-stage communities we have established with our education and engagement work,” she said. “English National Ballet’s fundamental aim to bring world-class ballet to the widest possible audience has always resonated with me. It is the reason the company has been a part of my life for so many years, from performing here as a dancer early in my career, to returning as artistic director in 2012. My admiration and support do not end here. I will remain invested in English National Ballet’s continued success in the years to come.” English National Ballet’s chair, Sir Roger Carr, said Rojo had propelled the company to new heights. “After 10 years at the helm,” he said, “the legacy that Tamara leaves will be long lasting and it is hoped that in her new position in San Francisco she will have the opportunity to capitalise on past achievements and build a bridge between these two great ballet companies for joint endeavours to our mutual benefit.” He added: “I speak on behalf of us all at the English National Ballet when I offer my sincere thanks and wish Tamara every success in the future.”",Arts/Stage,Tamara Rojo to leave English National Ballet after 10 years as artistic director,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/11/tamara-rojo-to-leave-english-national-ballet
1/12/2022,"Germany’s new economy and climate protection minister has called for the nation to pull together to realise the “gigantic task” of creating a climate neutral country, saying it posed a considerable social and financial challenge as well as a big opportunity. Introducing a broad outline of his ambitious plans to the public for the first time since entering government as part of a three-way coalition last month, the Green party’s Robert Habeck called for a threefold increase in the speed with which carbon dioxide emissions are reduced, arguing Germany faced a race against time and required a “massive national debate” to achieve the goals set out by his ministry. He said the government faced an uphill task to win many people over to the idea of a transition.  “It is a large political task, but one that of course also offers an enormous chance,” he said, adding that it was “mightily ambitious” and would require the entire country to engage in “fresh thinking”. Asked if he believed he could succeed and whether he was in danger of destroying the reputation of the Greens if he failed, Habeck, who has a reputation for turning to literature for inspiration, quoted the German poet Friedrich Hölderlin, stating: “Where there is danger so the power to save grows accordingly.” Habeck warned Germany was currently “dramatically behind” in its aim to achieve a goal for 80% of energy to come from renewable sources by 2030, as well as for a 65% reduction in greenhouse gases compared with 1990 levels, and to become climate neutral by 2045. Currently about 42% of energy in Germany comes from renewables. Habeck said a radical overhaul of planning and building processes would be required as well as changes to industry and a slimming down of bureaucracy. Announcing a mandate for solar panels to be put on all new builds, he repeated his party’s pre-election manifesto that 2% of the entire surface of the country should make way for the mechanisms required for renewable energy, such as windfarms, solar panels and hydrogen technology. He urged people to embrace the technology and said this would help free Germany from dependence on unstable global markets. So far only two out of 16 states, Schleswig-Holstein and Hesse, are anywhere near the 2% target. A more relaxed and flexible approach towards rules governing the building of turbines was required, he said, expressing his frustration over a recent ruling in the southern state of Bavaria, according to which turbines cannot be erected closer to homes than a distance equivalent to 10 times their height. Habeck said he was planning to announce a first tranche of climate protection measures by Easter, and a second by the end of the summer, to come into force by 2023. The government’s plans have been fiercely criticised by Fridays for Future climate activists, who say they are too little, too late and are a betrayal of the Greens’ own principles. “We can no longer follow the policy of ‘we’ll do what we can’, rather we must have a policy according to the principle of ‘we’ll do what is necessary right now’. That is unfortunately not the case right now,” Hannah Pirot of Fridays for Future Berlin told the broadcaster InfoRadio. Habeck rejected the claims. He said: “I don’t recognise the charge of betrayal.” He added the goals of his government had to remain realistic and the effort had to be a collective one. Habeck said large-scale immigration would be necessary to realise the energy transition, which would require a considerable number of engineers, craftspeople and carers. “We have 300,000 job openings today and we expect that to rise to a million and more. If we don’t close that gap, we will face real productivity problems,” he said. He said while the pandemic had led to a reduction in CO2 emissions, these had risen again last year. “The trend is going in the wrong direction and that is of concern,” he said. Caution towards his plans came from within the government itself, with the pro-business FDP’s Reinhard Houben welcoming them, but urging Habeck to “not lose sight” of issues such as affordable energy and concerns over energy security. The government has said it will provide subsidies to enable lower income families to better shoulder increases in energy costs. The chair of the German Association of Towns and Municipalities, Gerd Landsberg, warned of the contradiction Habeck would face between people expressing their support for a rollout of renewable energy at the same time as resisting anything that might be built close to their own homes. “People are in favour of alternative energy as long as they don’t have to see or hear the facilities behind them,” he told German television.",News/World news,German climate minister says speed of carbon cuts needs to be trebled,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/germany-must-pull-together-to-achieve-climate-targets-says-green-minister
1/12/2022,"Andy Murray has welcomed Novak Djokovic’s release from immigration detention but he anticipates that the men’s world No 1 will have a number of questions to answer in the coming days if he remains in Australia. Djokovic spent his first full day of freedom focusing on tennis matters as he took to Melbourne’s Rod Laver Arena behind closed doors for much-needed practice after the best part of five days spent in a hotel room fighting the cancellation of his visa.  Off court however, his status remained in limbo as Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, continued to deliberate over whether to exercise his reserved powers and attempt, for a second time, to deport the Serbian, while fresh questions arose over the accuracy of Djokovic’s travel documents. There was no response from the Djokovic camp, either, following increasing attention on the positive PCR Test from 16 December on which he relied to obtain a medical exemption to travel and his apparent maskless appearances in public in social media posts shortly after that date. As players began to speak about Djokovic’s detainment, Murray said that it was positive to see Djokovic win his hearing but he believes there are still issues to be resolved. “It’s positive that he’s not in detention any more,” said Murray. “Obviously he won in court, so that’s a positive thing for him. Hopefully [he] will be able to concentrate on the tennis now. You know, I think there are still a few questions that need to be answered around, you know, the isolation and stuff, which I’m sure we’ll hear from him in the next few days.” Meanwhile, Marton Fucsovics of Hungary became one of the first players to publicly disagree with Djokovic’s presence in Australia. The 29-year-old Hungarian described Djokovic as the greatest player in the sport and underlined the respect he has for the No 1. “However, we must not go beyond what is happening in the world now,” he said, speaking with M1, a Hungarian TV channel. “People’s health is paramount, and there are rules that were outlined months ago, namely that everyone should vaccinate themselves, and Djokovic didn’t. From this point of view, I don’t think he would have the right to be here.” On Monday, Djokovic and his team of lawyers won their court hearing and successfully restored the 34-year-old’s visa when Judge Anthony Kelly found that the Australian Border Force had not given Djokovic enough time to speak with his lawyers and Tennis Australia before cancelling his visa. Thus allowed out of detention and to move around freely, Djokovic went straight from his lawyers’ offices to train at Melbourne Park and he returned for a second session in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, where he practised with Australian junior James McCabe on Rod Laver Arena. Amid ample curiosity about his physical condition after several days spent detained in a hotel room, Djokovic opted for his session to be held behind closed doors and the live feed of Rod Laver Arena in the press rooms was temporarily taken down. Top players sometimes opt to compete without an audience when they would rather the public or their rivals cannot see them. However, the tournament went through extraordinary measures to keep all eyes out with nearly every door in the arena locked shut. Aside from Tennis Australia’s in-house videographers, the only footage of Djokovic came through a drone directed by 9News, although Tennis Australia photographers were allowed to pool images. As Djokovic continues his preparation, he does so with clouds seeming to multiply above his head. The Australia Border Force is investigating suggestions that Djokovic disclosed incorrect information on his Australia Travel Declaration. In the form, released after his court hearing on Monday, Djokovic – who indicated among different court documents that his agent and Tennis Australia had completed the form at different times – declared that he had not travelled to any other country in the 14 days before he began his journey to Australia from Spain on 4 January. However, on Tuesday photos on social media appeared to indicate that he had recently travelled from Serbia as he had posed alongside the Serbian handball player Petar Djordjic in Belgrade on Christmas Day. Djokovic has not commented and it is not clear when the image was taken. Should Djokovic remain in Australia and compete in the tournament, Tennis Australia – who on Tuesday formally confirmed he would be the No 1 men’s seed – will likely be moved to increase security after the rowdy scenes on Monday as police used pepper spray on members of the public as they stormed a car they thought to be carrying Djokovic away from his lawyers’ offices. In the wake of Djokovic’s successful hearing, the ATP addressed his detainment for the first time in a lengthy statement, acknowledging the saga has been detrimental to all concerned. The men’s tennis governing body noted its respect for the Australian public’s sentiments and the strict border laws while expressing support for Djokovic. “It’s clear Novak Djokovic believed he had been granted a necessary medical exemption in order to comply with entry regulations,” said the ATP. “The series of events leading to Monday’s court hearing have been damaging on all fronts, including for Novak’s well-being and preparation for the Australian Open.”",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray says Djokovic has questions to answer as players dive into visa row,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/murray-says-djokovic-has-questions-to-answer-as-players-dive-into-visa-row
1/12/2022,"Back in his fifth makeshift studio after testing positive for Covid, Seth Meyers (boosted and asymptomatic, he noted) returned to Late Night to mock Ted Cruz’s groveling appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show over the weekend.  The Texas senator’s appearance on Carlson’s show, in which he apologized for condemning the 6 January assault on the Capitol as a terrorist attack, was “so pathetic, I honestly thought I was delirious from the Covid”, Meyers said on Monday evening. “Look, we all know Ted Cruz has a thing for self-humiliation,” Meyers noted. “He slinked back from Cancún after escaping the blackout in his state, he endorsed Donald Trump after Trump insulted his wife and his father,” and “he keeps showing up in public with that facial hair, looking like a Chewbacca who shaved everything but the beard.” So Cruz’s about-face wasn’t entirely surprising. Just a day before the first anniversary of the insurrection, Cruz told Congress, “we are approaching a solemn anniversary this week, and it is an anniversary of a violent terrorist attack on the Capitol.” “I mean, it’s the right thing to say, even though it’s definitely a little weird to condemn an attack you helped whip up by spreading the very lies that fueled that mob,” Meyers explained. “It’s like when OJ promised to find the real killer, except in Cruz’s case it’s arguably worse because he’s doing it at the scene of the crime.” But “even that bare minimum condemnation of the January 6th attack was apparently too much for the new enforcers of Republican orthodoxy like Tucker Carlson.” Carlson, who is rumored to harbor ambitions for a Republican presidential run against Cruz, tore into the senator on-air. “You called this a ‘terror attack’ when by no definition was it a terror attack,” Carlson said. “That’s a lie. You told that lie on purpose, and I’m wondering why you did.” Cruz corrected: “I agree with you, it was a mistake to say that yesterday.” “Wow, I knew Ted had a thing for self-humiliation, but that is next-level,” said Meyers. On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert tepidly addressed the discovery of 25 cases of a coronavirus strain in Cyprus which combines elements of the Delta and Omicron variants, nicknamed “Deltacron”. “Deltacron: also the name of the disappointing Transformer who turns into a delayed flight for Atlanta,” Colbert joked. The new variant follows on the heels of the Omicron surge, which may or may not decline sharply by the end of the months, according to experts. Said Dr Anthony Fauci over the weekend of Omicron’s future: “I would hope – I can’t predict accurately because no one can – but I would hope by the time we get to the fourth week in January – end of the third week, beginning of the fourth week – that we will start to see this coming down.” “Can you be more specific?” Colbert responded. “That’s like your horoscope reading ‘Capricorn, you will make a connection with a handsome stranger. Or not. Maybe he’ll give you a disease. No one can predict accurately.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel noted the rapid spread of Omicron among his staff, which shut down production last week, and encourage alternative motivations for getting the unvaccinated to participate. Quebec, for instance, has announced a vaccine requirement for the purchase of alcohol and cannabis; first-dose appointments have increased from 1,500 a day to 6,000. “I think maybe Pfizer needs to come out with some gummies and a hard lemonade,” said Kimmel. “Of course, there are all sorts of new crazy miracle cures and remedies,” he said, pointing to a particularly egregious anti-vax evangelist named Christopher Key who touts “urine therapy” – drinking one’s own urine – as a Covid treatment. “If this guy’s kids ever set up a lemonade stand in your neighborhood, run,” said Kimmel. “Urine therapy – that’s actually one conspiracy theory I’m OK with,” he added. “You think vaccines were created by the devil or George Soros or Bill Gates? Go ahead, pee in a mason jar and chug along with Dr Dumbass.”",Arts/Culture,"Seth Meyers on Ted Cruz: ‘So pathetic, I honestly thought I was delirious’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/11/seth-meyers-ted-cruz-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel
1/12/2022,"Wordle, a deceptively simple online word puzzle, has had a meteoric rise since its launch last autumn, from 90 daily players in November to 300,000 at the beginning of January, to 2 million last weekend. But, for its creator, the game’s rapid success has resulted in as much anxiety as excitement. The game has become an unexpected grassroots hit for Josh Wardle, who developed it for his puzzle-loving partner. The pair played it for fun on their sofa, and other users slowly began to join them.  Every day, there is a new word to guess, and players get just six chances to identify it. Wordle’s popularity is thought to be partly because, in an era of apps aggressively competing for your attention and time, the game was deliberately built to be played once a day, and without features designed to promote its growth such as push notifications and email sign ups. As its popularity has snowballed on social media, Wardle, a software engineer based in Brooklyn who is originally from Wales, has begun to feel overwhelmed by the response. “It going viral doesn’t feel great to be honest. I feel a sense of responsibility for the players. I feel I really owe it to them to keep things running and make sure everything’s working correctly.” But he takes comfort in the knowledge that his game has brought joy to people at a difficult time. “I get emails from people who say things like ‘hey, we can’t see our parents due to Covid at the moment but we share our Wordle results each day’. During this weird situation it’s a way for people to connect in a low effort, low friction way.” The game really took off when one user in New Zealand (where the game is especially popular) displayed her results in a sequence of emojis on Twitter, prompting Wardle to build a function that would allow users to share theirs more easily, in a visually appealing Rubik’s Cube-style grid configuration. Wardle also thinks the game is so popular because it’s simple and accessible, yet also challenging. “Even though I play it every day, I still feel a sense of accomplishment when I do it: it makes me feel smart, and people like that.” Part of the appeal of Wardle’s game is that it harks back to a more innocent age of the internet, gaming experts say. Users have grown cynical about many apps’ ethically dubious use of their data and attempts to monetise game play or foster addictive behaviour. “The internet is in a really bad place at the moment, but this is great because it’s not doing all those nasty things. It’s what the web was like when we first had it, it was much more playful,” said Adam Procter, who leads the game design course at Southampton University. Prof Chris Headleand, the head of game design technology at Staffordshire University, added that Wordle may also have benefited from its timing. A short daily game is a welcome reminder to take a break for those who are working from home. Equally, people have missed out on opportunities to connect with family and friends over in-person games during the pandemic. The rules were also intuitive for people who grew up playing word games such as Scrabble, or a code-breaking game such as Mastermind, said Steve Bromley, the author of How To Be A Games User Researcher. Wordle combined this familiarity with an opportunity to show mastery and to improve performance over time, a blend which enabled players to enter into a “flow state”. The game has also proven popular among mathematicians, who enjoy applying information theory to work out the best strategies for success. One tweet shared an algorithm that it said would result in the answer 50% of the time, or a choice of three 90% of the time. Others have worked out which words are best to start with to maximise your chances of success. One suggestion is to start with adieu, which has a lot of vowels. Tim Gowers, a mathematics professor at Cambridge, suggested choosing two words with a lot of commonly used letters where none are reproduced, for example “tripe” followed by “coals”. Gowers explained that the game touched on the theory of entropy, which is a measure of how much information is needed to specify a particular object (the Wordle’s word of the day) out of a collection of objects (all the five-letter words in Wordle’s dictionary). The question Wardle is currently grappling with is whether to evolve the game further. “I need to be really thoughtful. It’s not my full-time job and I don’t want it to become a source of stress and anxiety in my life. If I do make any changes, I would like to think they are changes I would have made even if it was just [my partner and I] playing.”",Arts/Games,Wordle creator overwhelmed by global success of hit puzzle,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle
1/12/2022,"Iam starting to think that common sense really is not that common after all – we live in exceedingly stupid times. Exhibit 874: US anti-vaxxers are now urging people to drink their own urine to fight coronavirus. Over the weekend, Christopher Key, the leader of an anti-Covid-19 vaccine group called the “Vaccine Police”, posted videos online extolling the health benefits of what he described as “urine therapy”. According to the wizard of wee, there is “tons and tons of research … [and] peer-reviewed published papers on urine”; so if you do your own pee-search you will discover it is God’s own antidote to Covid-19. “This vaccine is the worst bioweapon I have ever seen,” Key said. “I drink my own urine!” That is not the only questionable thing he does. Key was recently arrested for refusing to wear a mask and filming proceedings during a court hearing. The reason he was in court? He was arrested in April for refusing to wear a mask at a Whole Foods store. In August he made headlines for suggesting that pharmacists should be executed for administering coronavirus vaccines; in December he also set off on a road trip across the US with a fake badge and firearms, in a mission to arrest a Democratic governor over vaccine mandates. Very busy man, our Mr Key! I cannot help thinking that if his name was Mohammed his shenanigans would have had him locked up in Guantánamo Bay by now.  Key’s “urine therapy” is far from the only experimental – and highly dubious – Covid “cure” to be promoted during the pandemic. We all remember the former US president’s comments on the benefits of injecting bleach. Last year saw a prolonged bout of Ivermectin-mania. Now, along with urine, the right seems to be fixated on Viagra and colloidal silver. Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, who has repeatedly questioned the efficacy and safety of Covid vaccines, recently dedicated a portion of his show to hyping the potential of Viagra as a potential cure. Carlson seized on the story of a British nurse reportedly recovering from a Covid-19 coma, after being given a dose of Viagra, to sing the little blue pill’s praises. “Is there anything [Viagra] doesn’t cure?” Carlson joked. Yes, I am afraid it does not appear to cure stupidity. Speaking of which, the conservative media personality Candace Owens recently told her social media followers that she takes a “teaspoon a day” of colloidal silver, a product that has also been touted as a Covid cure by the likes of Infowars founder Alex Jones. I am sure I do not need to tell you this but there is zero evidence that colloidal silver can help with Covid. On the contrary, taking too much can turn your skin blue permanently and, in rare cases, can even kill you. (I can never resist an opportunity to big-up my hero Wilkie Collins, so I urge you to read his underrated novel Poor Miss Finch, about a blind woman who falls in love with identical twins, one of whom turns blue after trying to cure his epilepsy with silver. The novel won’t cure Covid but it may provide temporary reprieve from existential ennui.) The amount of misinformation about Covid cures is highly depressing, and it is important that we hold to account the people spreading dangerous falsehoods, and undermining trust in the vaccine. Still, let us be clear: the biggest obstacle towards ending this pandemic is not kooks such as Key and Owens. The obstacle is the rich countries that have been hoarding vaccines, and the likes of Pfizer and Moderna, who have been slow to license their vaccine technology (developed with taxpayer money) to poor countries. The fact that big pharma is making billions from a public health crisis is unconscionable. I am very pro-vaccine but I am running out of enthusiasm for boosters. The idea of potentially having to get a fourth shot soon, while so much of the world still cannot access a first dose, makes me sick. If only we had a vaccine for greed.

1/12/2022,"A trainee soldier was racially abused by a British army instructor who called him “Paki Rambo” – a nickname used in the satirical film Four Lions about a group of inept jihadists, a court martial has been told. Rifleman Kasem Salem, who is originally from Egypt, was also allegedly dubbed a “carpet rider” by Cpl Robert Mehers while he underwent his basic training.  Salem, 20, told the court he was a Muslim who moved to the UK keen to follow his father into the military but he felt “marginalised” by the alleged comments. Capt Daniel Lawlor, prosecuting, said Salem started his infantry training in April 2019 with 5 Rifles, having moved to the UK from Egypt in 2012 with his father. He told the court in, Bulford, Wiltshire, that Mehers was an instructor at the infantry training centre in Catterick, North Yorkshire.Salem said he was treated as an equal in his first week but allegedly felt he started to become marginalised after a meeting with instructors, where he spoke at length about his culture and religion. Salem told the court: “I decided to join the army because my father and his father served, so it’s a tradition. I was very open about my religion, faith and family … we talked about my beliefs and my culture.”He said Mehers was initially very understanding and went “the extra mile”, making sure he had set times to pray and all his dietary requirements were fulfilled. He said he greeted him with “Good morning, how are you?” in Arabic. There were also “discussions about cultural understandings” with the recruits, where they could ask questions about sensitive subjects.But Salem said he began to be called a “Paki Rambo”, “Egyptian’” and “carpet rider” and felt singled out because of his religion and upbringing. The court had been told a second instructor, Sgt Christopher Tolley, allegedly learned the Arabic for: “Your mother’s a whore” so he could insult Salem in his first language. It was also claimed Tolley told Salem his father was not allowed to attend a parade because he might be a suicide bomber and “his car might have a bomb in it”.But Tolley’s barrister, Ed Wylde, told the hearing Salem referred to himself as “Paki Rambo” after he and fellow recruits watched the Chris Morris satire Four Lions, in which one of the characters uses the phrase.Wylde said he even ran around the accommodation block “pretending to be a terrorist” and used “Allahu Akbar” – “God is greatest” as his “rallying cry” when attacking training dummies during a bayonet exercise.He said the young soldier was “the driving force behind the comedic variation of that stereotype”.Tolley and Mehers were both charged with ill treatment of a subordinate but Tolley was found not guilty after Salem’s evidence and Wylde’s submissions. The court ruled that the evidence against Tolley was not strong enough for a case to be answered and directed the board hearing the case to return a verdict of not guilty.Mehers denies the charge of ill treatment and the trial against him continues.",News/UK news,"UK army instructor racially taunted Muslim trainee soldier, court martial told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/11/uk-army-instructor-racially-taunted-muslim-trainee-soldier-court-martial-told
1/12/2022,"Outside the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan in south-western Sydney are four shipping containers with freezers inside. Over the next six months, more than a million plant specimens will be cycled through the containers, each spending about a week in the cold to rid them of any insects.  It’s an important step in a large operation to relocate the National Herbarium of New South Wales from the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney to a new facility at the Mount Annan site. Once inside, the collection will be moved into vaults that have been cleaned and fumigated and are temperature-controlled at 16C with 45% to 50% relative humidity to prevent insect infestations and mould. “Just about any plant you get growing in the bush is probably represented in our collection,” says Hannah McPherson, the herbarium’s collections manager. “We have really iconic Australian plants like wattle, eucalyptus and Sturt’s desert pea. “And then there are more difficult-to-manage things like cactus and stinging trees and palms that we have to house in a different way by hanging them in lockers.” The relocation will mark the end point for another project that will make the herbarium – which is not physically open to the public – much more accessible to researchers and the broader community. For nearly three years, staff and volunteers have been going through about 70,000 boxes in a mammoth undertaking to digitise the herbarium’s collection. It’s the largest mass digitisation of a natural history collection undertaken in the southern hemisphere and by the time it is completed there will be a digital record of 99% of the specimens the herbarium holds. The process has allowed staff to do something that had never occurred at the herbarium before. They’ve looked at every specimen the facility holds, auditing the entire collection, which covers Australian and global locations and dates back to samples taken in the 1700s. “Something that most people don’t know is that institutions like this one don’t know everything they have,” says the herbarium’s digitisation manager, Andre Badiou. “The Royal Botanic Garden is now the longest-running scientific institution in Australia. If you’ve got things that have been collected since that time, things get put away in boxes. “There are also other [facilities] that close down and send us their collections. It’s just not possible to keep up with that kind of input. So after a couple of years, you’ve lost track of everything you have.” To digitise the collection, every specimen was given a QR code and put on a conveyor belt that had cameras at the mid and end points. Sensors would read the label, images were taken and auto-cropped and the specimen was then packed into a trolley. Each specimen spent about two seconds in front of the camera. “You’re getting about 4,000 images a day going through,” Badiou says. “You can imagine just with a camera if you had a million plants to take photos of it would take forever.” The images were sent to the Netherlands-based digitisation company Picturae, which created different file types, some for internal use at the herbarium and others that are being uploaded to Amazon Web Services for scientists and the public to access. Alembo, a specialised transcription service based in Suriname, has also been working with herbarium staff to transcribe handwritten labels into digital records. Eventually, every specimen will end up on the Atlas of Living Australia and infrastructure is in development to make the whole collection more searchable. Through the course of the audit, items were discovered that herbarium staff had not realised were in their possession. These include two specimens that pre-date the herbarium’s existing special collection of 824 specimens Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected in Australia in 1770. One of them is a snowberry, or Gaultheria antipoda, collected in 1769 in New Zealand. The other is Parietaria debilis, a herb native to Australia and New Zealand that Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected the same year from Tolaga, Opuragi and Motuaro. They will be added to the special collections vault at the new state-of-the-art building at Mount Annan. The digitisation process also uncovered previously unknown illustrations in the specimen boxes, including work by the Australian botanical artist Margaret Flockton. It has resulted in a doubling of the herbarium’s illustration library, which is also being digitised and will remain at the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney. Most of the specimens the herbarium holds were collected by botanists. Older samples are markers of colonialism and the white, male field it was for a long time, Badiou says. There are also samples collected by gardeners, bushwalkers and farmers trying to identify plants on their properties, or orchid collectors who travel the world just to see one particular plant. Badiou says one particularly important collection is from a woman who followed her husband to remote Western Australia. She collected, dried and wrote about plant life on a property in a part of the country that is not represented anywhere else in the more than 1 million specimens. About 8,000 new items are added to the herbarium each year. The specimens are used for ecology, evolutionary studies, botanical consulting, artworks and bush regeneration. McPherson recently gave a talk to a group of poets using the specimens for inspiration. There are narcotic plants, such as opium poppies, which are kept under lock and key, and the site runs an identification service that is often called upon to identify items in criminal or poisoning cases. McPherson says anything related to looking after the environment also ends up coming back to the specimens in some way. The completed digitisation project will open the herbarium up on a scale that hasn’t been possible previously, she says. “Often people think of a herbarium like a museum, they keep lots of old stuff in there,” she says. “But for us as scientists we think of it as an active research collection because those old specimens are still just as relevant as the ones collected today. “It’s not just a dusty old warehouse.” The herbarium is part of a global lending and borrowing network that involves sending physical specimens to facilities all over the world for scientific research. The new images are of such high quality that researchers may no longer need to work with the actual physical specimen. “The point of the herbarium specimen is not just to be a plant in a collection, it’s a plant that represents a time and a place,” McPherson says. “We don’t just learn about that plant but a whole landscape and that landscape through time.” That includes looking at how a landscape has changed, how human activities have changed and reduced plant populations, and how the climate crisis is affecting plants – all the way down to leaf shape. “We could do that to an extent before but now there is just so much more we can do that will help us with our science,” she says.",News/Australia news,Heavy lifting at Sydney’s herbarium: the quest to move and catalogue more than 1m plant specimens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/heavy-lifting-at-sydneys-herbarium-the-quest-to-move-and-catalogue-more-than-1m-plant-specimens
1/12/2022,"Igrew up in a household eating copious amounts of chilli at every mealtime: heapings of chopped bird’s eye on eggs, extremely liberal lashings of Tabasco in popcorn, huge dollops of hot sauce consumed straight from the spoon. It was the idyllic childhood, probably because I spent most of it in a hot and heady daze, tongue burning and mind pleasantly blissed out in picante pleasure.  These days, I make my own chilli oil whenever I’m feeling particularly nostalgic. The right chilli oil feels transportive. For the less sentimental, it also just tastes great on almost any savoury dish, banishing weak-flavoured woes. Neil Perry recommends it on steamed silken tofu; Kylie Kwong drenches dumplings in the stuff; Meera Sodha tops vegan noodles with a light smattering for extra oomph. There are many variations out there, but I favour a very simple recipe of just four ingredients. You will need: a good handful of chilli flakes, salt, minced garlic, and vegetable oil. Eyeball everything. Throw it all into a pot at medium heat and let it simmer until the garlic just turns brown – the result is a brilliant red condiment with crispy garlic bits. The great thing about chilli oil is that it lends itself to experimentation: anything (and everything) goes. Add sesame, or cardamom, or grated ginger, or shallots, or Szechuan peppercorns on repeat attempts. Does too much of this chilli oil make my stomach ache with an intense burning sensation as I lay awake at 3am? Yes. Will I continue making it and then over-indulging anyway? Also yes. Reader beware: if you are unlike me in that you are sane, just a light patter of this chilli oil is sufficient to add requisite zing to your dish. My perfect lazy dinner is chilli oil on rice, but it’s also easily dressed down in toasties, soups and salads, or dressed up à la Ottolenghi. And for the extra lazy, Lao Gan Ma offers an iconic store-bought version that’s available in the international aisle (as well as all Asian groceries).

1/12/2022,"Foot pain is a common, disabling condition associated with older age and obesity and is more prevalent in women than in men. A 2008 study found that foot pain affects nearly one in five people aged 18 years and over in Australia. Dr Kade Paterson, a researcher at the Centre for Health, Exercise and Sports Medicine at the University of Melbourne and certified sports podiatrist, says in younger to middle-aged adults, plantar heel pain is the most common condition, affecting around 5-8% of the general population.  But as people age, the most common cause of foot pain is osteoarthritis of the big toe and the ankle joints, says Prof Kim Bennell, an academic physiotherapist and the director of the centre. Some illnesses can also affect the feet, such as diabetes or poor blood flow, says Prof David Hunter, a rheumatologist at Royal North Shore Hospital and the University of Sydney. Because the feet are involved in most types of exercising, foot pain can deter people from physical activity. But exercise, Bennell says, strengthens the muscles, improves flexibility and balance, and helps with weight loss, reducing the load on the feet. It also provides psychological benefits. “Exercise makes people feel better,” says Hunter. “Pain might still be present but can be better tolerated.” Exercise can help reduce foot pain in many ways, but it is essential to consult a podiatrist, doctor or a physiotherapist before you begin. There is evidence that tai chi and yoga classes can help reduce foot pain, Bennell says. Tai chi and yoga are excellent, holistic workouts that can strengthen and improve the whole body,” says Paterson. These barefoot practices can help strengthen the feet’s muscles and increase stability. Tai chi and yoga classes can also improve balance, essential to avoid falls and further injuries, especially as people get older. “The balance benefits that come with tai chi and yoga are an additional benefit that we don’t see with some of the other workout classes,” Paterson says. “Classes have the benefit of social participation as well,” adds Bennell. “People with persistent pain can often find it helpful to be in a group setting.” “My number one go-to exercise is some form of calf raises,” says Josh Butcher, a podiatrist and APA musculoskeletal physiotherapist. Although it can be challenging for many people, he says, calf raises are great for improving calf strength, stabilising the foot and preventing injuries. “If you have great calf strength, it means you don’t have to compensate through other muscles or other joints within the foot,” he says. “You’re using your body’s natural spring mechanism to propel forward and move.” Calf raises are a simple exercise you can easily slip into your day-to-day life. Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart. Push through the balls of your feet to raise your heels, keeping the knees extended but not locked. Hold for one second, then lower slowly back to the ground. This exercise has many variations, and you can slowly increase the intensity over time. You can begin with seated calf raises if standing causes too much strain. You can progress with weighted calf raises by holding weights in your hands or a single-leg calf raise by lifting one foot off the floor and holding on to a chair for balance. “[Calf raises] strengthen the big muscles that are outside of the foot and run into the foot. They also work out the little muscles that live inside the foot,” says Paterson. “It’s a really good all-round exercise to support foot function and can have pain-relieving effects.” However, he says calf raises might exacerbate some forefoot conditions, such as neuroma or bursitis, so it is essential to modify the exercise if necessary. “Walking is always a good exercise for [foot] osteoarthritis,” says Bennell. But even a short stroll might feel excruciating to someone with severe foot pain, so starting with short easy walks is recommended. Running is also an excellent activity for foot pain, especially if you already are a runner, Bennell says. But pacing yourself is critical. “Running is really good for foot pain,” says Butcher. “It just has to be done really well as it can lead to further injuries if you do it incorrectly. Starting with a coach to 5k run programs is always preferable.” He also recommends getting footwear checked by a recognised running-shoe shop. “Provided that the pain is not getting too bad or lasting too long, then certainly running is fantastic,” agrees Paterson. “But if you find this weight-bearing exercise makes your pain worse, then you can look at non-weight-bearing options like swimming or cycling.” While exercise has several benefits, all experts agree that people with foot pain should avoid doing too much too quickly. “Ease into it,” says Butcher. After months of lockdown, people are eager to get out and move more, he says, but overloading your feet too suddenly might exacerbate foot pain. “Having some pain during exercise is OK and expected,” says Bennell. “But if you are getting much worse symptoms that don’t settle down by the next day, then obviously whatever you are doing is a bit much and you need to back off.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How to move: with foot pain,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/12/how-to-move-with-foot-pain
1/12/2022,"The first time the audience lays eyes on Seth Cohen (Adam Brody), soon to become one of the biggest breakout characters in teen TV history, he is sitting cross-legged in pajamas, furiously playing a video game with his hair bed-coiffed like a parentless Kevin McCallister. It’s not the greatest sartorial start, but it is the perfect introduction to the smart, sullen, self-centred seventeen-year-old at the centre of this fish-out-of-water comedy/drama. By comparison, the first shot of the troubled Marissa Cooper (Mischa Barton) is positively dreamlike: bathed in soft, shimmering, streaming sunshine, half-smiling, every inch the teenage dream she would become to millions as The OC quickly caught fire. She lives next door to Seth, but they exist in different universes.  Soon we would meet Summer Roberts (Rachel Bilson), Seth’s unattainable crush and Marissa’s unlikely best friend; the type of girl who is comfortable going to house-parties in a bikini, who spouts California-isms like every day was a pep rally, as seemingly shallow as the bathing pools they party around. Our entry point to this rarefied world is Ryan Atwood (Ben MacKenzie), fresh out of lock-up, dressed in a singlet, abandoned by his mother, carrying all his worldly possessions in a sack. Kindly lawyer Sandy Cohen (played by a brilliant Peter Gallagher) was charged with defending the wayward kid and recognised a spark in him. By the time the first episode ends, Ryan is living with Sandy in a Newport mansion, as much a misplaced puzzle piece as his new roommate Seth. California, here we come! The OC was one of those lightning-in-a-bottle shows, intended by its creators to be a cross between The Karate Kid and 90210, and containing all the essential elements of both: a James Dean-type from the wrong side of the track; a smart kid who can’t wait to leave the fishbowl he was born into; buckets of tragic teenage love set among wealth, glamour and Californian coastlines; and hard-partying teens shepherded by troubled adults. There were overdoses, house fires, fist fights galore, and more drama in an hour-long episode than in the entire lifespan of most TV shows. Showrunner and creator Josh Schwartz, himself still in his late 20s and working on his first ever show, sprinted through storylines at such a fast pace that by the end of season two, major cracks were starting to appear. The OC burned brightly and briefly, only surviving four seasons – and about one-and-a-half great ones. But its cultural impact far outstripped its time on TV – like Friends or 90210, its stars will always be known for the vehicles that introduced them to the world. This show introduced the world to the concept of Chrismukkah: the Jewish/Christian hybrid holiday. Seth’s devoted fandom turned Death Cab For Cutie from Midwestern indie hopefuls into a million-selling mainstream rock band. Reality show staples The Hills and The Real Housewives of Orange County were both spawned by the public’s insatiable interest in this pocket of California. It even made water polo realistically seem like a sport the tough kids would play. Unlike most shows starring teens, the “adults” were given ample screentime and their own sophisticated storylines, with Sandy Cohen quickly and correctly becoming a sex symbol in his own right. (Forget Cara Delevingne; Sandy made big eyebrows a trend.) Best of all, the OC was ridiculous, and knew it. The show was filled with self-knowing winks, wry references to its own craziness, and never painted its faulted characters as entirely aspirational – despite how many pool-houses and ponies they possessed. Like California itself, everyone’s lives were built on fissures. Every minor rumble would trigger an earthquake; every mega-mansion was built upon shifting sand. Season one is where The OC peaked, but it’s the second season that is arguably the one people remember the most, as we meet improbable indie rock club The Bait Shop and its revolving lineup of the best acts from the mid-2000s. The Killers, Modest Mouse, The Thrills, The Walkmen, Rachel Yamagata and, yes, Death Cab all played at the venue, which Seth once quipped was the only place you could comfortably talk over the music, and which never had a drinks line. As a glossy time capsule of a specific era, there is no better show to revisit than The OC. As a high-octane, hilarious dive into a world that could never exist, it’s pretty much perfect. As Death Cab sang, this is the new year. The world is in turmoil. Slip into something comfortable.

1/12/2022,"Australia’s focus on hand hygiene has been about as effective as telling people mosquitoes will give them HIV, leading epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre says. Professor MacIntyre of the University of New South Wales said there needs to be a national air safety campaign and national standards set for safe indoor air.  At the start of the Covid pandemic, the federal government spent millions of dollars on awareness campaigns convincing Australians to wash their hands properly and to socially distance. But as understanding of the virus improved and evidence showed it was mostly spread through the air, there was no similar campaign for improved ventilation. “There is lots of denial. It’s hard as human beings to accept this [virus] occurred … I don’t think we’re going back to 2019 anytime soon,” MacIntyre said. “It hasn’t mutated into the common cold. This is not the flu. We need to get our heads out of the sand.” That means, despite vaccine availability, people should still wear masks and realise that “washing your hands won’t protect you”. “It’s like telling everyone HIV is spread by mosquitoes – ‘use your Aeroguard and you’ll be right’,” she said. When HIV emerged in the 1980s, people believed many myths about how it spread – such as through the air, touching, sweating, or mosquitoes. However, it is only transmissible through body fluids. While Covid can be spread through infected surfaces, the risk is very low and some researchers sneeringly call extensive washing and cleaning ”hygiene theatre”. It took a while for researchers and health authorities to catch up with the fact that Covid is primarily an airborne virus. Independent expert group OzSage on Monday recommended school openings should be delayed until students were vaccinated and indoor air standards were met. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In April 2021, the World Health Organisation updated its advice to recognise that “the virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.” Doctors then put pressure on Australia’s infection control expert group to focus more on air transmission. Prof Nancy Baxter, head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, said Australians took on board the messages about washing their hands back before vaccines were available. Then the new evidence about air transmission got bogged down in a debate about the definition of aerosol spread versus droplet spread. “The infection control people were among the last to come around,” Baxter said. “The people who had the most control over the narrative did [have a bias].” She said as vaccines started being distributed, no one saw the need to step up to “re-educate” people about the cause of most infections. School students could be better protected by moving classes outdoors, opening doors and windows, and understanding how well-ventilated classrooms are by using Co2 monitors. “And in spaces where you can’t improve the ventilation either through air conditioners or heating, or opening windows or doors, then Hepa filters work,” Baxter explained. There needs to be a standard for air quality, she said, because it’s a “workplace safety issue” for schools as well as workplaces. “People talk about living with Covid. It seems like from a government perspective, ignoring Covid is what we’re aiming for.” David Anderson, deputy director of the Burnet Institute, told ABC radio on Tuesday that there had been “practically no investment” in air quality. He said he was worried about school children going back into that environment. “Things like indoor air quality and ventilation, people have talked about it, we’ve known for at least 18 months that Covid is airborne, and there’s been practically no investment in improving air quality in indoor settings.” Guardian Australia contacted the federal health department and health minister Greg Hunt’s office for comment. A health department spokesperson said state and territory governments were responsible for workplace and environmental safety in schools and other workplaces, and that “some jurisdictional governments have been undertaking work to improve the ventilation in schools”. The department referred the inquiry about a national campaign and standard to Safe Work Australia. A SWA spokesperson said the states and territories were responsible for schools.",News/Australia news,"Australian air quality standards needed to combat Covid, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/australian-air-quality-standards-needed-to-combat-covid-experts-say
1/12/2022,"Rhys Nicholson has a vision for his upcoming Melbourne International Comedy festival show: zero mention of the pandemic. “I mean, who wants to talk about it?” he says. “There’ll be so many comedy shows, I reckon, that will be [titled] like ‘Blah Blah Gone Viral’, or some shit like that. And it’s just like, can we not talk about it? For just a little while? We’re living it. I would love just one aspect of my life to not involve talking about fucking Covid.”  But the pandemic did bring one useful object into Nicholson’s life: a meat thermometer. Like many of us, the comedian got very enthusiastic about cooking during lockdown. It even became a point of social connection. “Some friends and I started a Facebook group called Dinner Club and literally all we did is send each other photos of what we had for dinner that night,” he recalls. “It was so grim.” Here, Nicholson tells us about the life changing powers of this thermometer, as well as the story of two other important personal objects. Two rings that I wear – one is my engagement ring, and the other is an heirloom my father gave me that was his father’s, and his father’s father before him. I have a joke in my standup about how it’s been passed down to all the men in my family and I’m the closest thing we have to a man right now. It’s the first thing that came to mind because I’m always just terrified of losing it. Like, a ring is such an easy thing to lose and I can’t be the one, in a hundred years, who loses it. The engagement ring I got because I proposed to my partner, but I did it when I was really drunk in the middle of the night and didn’t remember it the next day, so I didn’t have a ring or anything like that. But my partner is a much better person than me. So one day a few months later, I had taken off the heirloom ring. My partner grabbed it, took it to one of our best friends, Lisa, who is a jewellery maker, and got her to measure it. Then he got the engagement ring made without my knowing and proposed to me on the top of a mountain. So he’s a real nightmare of a person! What a dick. This is a potentially boring answer, but I have a meat thermometer that you Bluetooth into your phone. I know that sounds so stupid. But you put the thermometer into the meat and leave it there, then there’s an app on your phone which tells you what the temperature is on the inside. You can set an alarm to go off when it gets to 58 degrees or whatever, without you having to constantly go and check it all the time. It’s weird when you get to an age where things like that become life changing. If you told me when I was 22 that I would be interested in meat thermometers, I’d be like “that sounds very depressing. I need to change the course of my life so that doesn’t happen”. But here I am, and it’s made my life a lot better. In the last couple of years, I’ve really tried to get better at cooking. It seemed to really kick off in the pandemic. Throughout the first lockdowns, I put on a tight eight kilos in six months, all from being deeply carnivorous. And that seems to be the magic number – everyone seems to have added between eight and 10. No one was like, oh, I put on three. A few years ago, I was heading to the airport in Auckland at 6am and realised I didn’t have my passport with me. I was coming back to Australia and was going to land and go straight to shows. It was too late to cancel them and my agent was calling people in a panic. It was the most useless I’ve ever felt in my life. But I got to the airport in Auckland and explained to a very nice Kiwi that I didn’t have my passport. I’m not exaggerating this in any way, he said, “no worries bro, let’s call Canberra”. Then a man in the airport called Canberra, I showed them my licence, and they let me on the plane! So it turns out if you’re ever in New Zealand and still have your licence, you can still get home. It’s up to the airline, which is wild to me. Air New Zealand were just like yeah, you seem like you.

1/12/2022,"There’s a simple reason Scott Morrison has refused to make rapid antigen tests free – and it has nothing to do with the budget or the economy. He just didn’t plan ahead. If he announced now that we could all have free test kits by February or March he’d be laughed out of office, so instead he is positioning himself as a fiscal conservative standing up to populists demanding he spend more money. As if.  To criticise Morrison for putting the health of the budget ahead of the health of Australians is to flatter him unfairly. Since the Covid crisis began, the Morrison government, having appointed a former gas executive to steer its Covid-19 recovery taskforce, has spent far more public money subsidising the gas industry than it will ever spend on rapid antigen tests. The idea that there is some trade-off between the health of Australians and the health of our economy is one of the foundations of Australian public debate, but it has no foundation in economics. As my colleague Jim Stanford surmised recently, you can’t have a healthy economy without a healthy workforce. That simple truth is now crystal clear to the restaurateurs and retailers who were recently demanding Covid restrictions be lifted. Morrison should have told them the truth before Christmas. Instead, he offered them false hope. As the election draws closer,Morrison is stuck in a dilemma of his own making. If he compensates businesses or workers for the costs of the freedoms he just granted, he’d have to admit he caused their pain. But if he doesn’t provide some support soon the economy will spiral downwards, only this time in the lead-up to a federal election. Ouch. Despite the months of blather from Morrison about the need to unshackle Australians from the yoke of (his) government’s oppressive regulations, the fact is it was government regulation and spending that got the country through the first two years of this crisis. Border controls, movement restrictions, mask mandates, QR codes and free vaccination delivered Australia one of the lowest death rates and unemployment rates in the world. Well-designed government intervention works. Josh Frydenberg knows that. As he released an economic update in December, the treasurer declared: “Having performed more strongly than any major advanced economy throughout the pandemic, the Australian economy is poised for a strong expansion.” I agree entirely, but that’s not the story Morrison wants to tell. No matter how many taxes or regulations he cuts, the reality is economies don’t work without workers, customers or supply chains. No matter how upbeat the prime minister appears, the Delta and Omicron variants of Covid are circulating freely in our shopping malls, restaurants, warehouses and hospitals. It is making hundreds of thousands of Australians sick, and it’s making millions think twice about going out to spend. Conservatives have spent decades claiming that enormously expensive tax cuts would “boost labour force participation” and in turn help grow the economy. But those same politicians don’t seem to care that Covid is knocking hundreds of thousands of people out of the workforce each week. And that’s before we send millions of unvaccinated children back to school who, even if they “only get a mild case,” will need parents to stay home and look after them. Thanks to lasts year’s strollout and this year’s poor planning, millions of Australians still aren’t eligible for their booster shot and, for reasons that are yet to be explained, millions of kids won’t be vaccinated before school returns. It’s true that Omicron presents new challenges and that Australians are tired of this pandemic. But, just as Churchill didn’t lose patience as the second world war dragged on, it’s Morrison’s job to stay focused and plan for what’s likely to happen, not what he’d prefer happens – and to communicate clearly with the public about the real challenges, and real choices, we face. I’m sure he would prefer to spend the next few months announcing expensive tax cuts instead of providing free RATs to all Australians. And I’m sure he would prefer to attack Labor over climate policy rather than work with the premiers to restore Australia’s testing and tracing capacity. But the job of the prime minister is to deal with the real crises that land in your lap, not respond to fabricated crises of your own making. There is strong evidence that controlling Covid was good for our economy these past few years; there’s no evidence that letting it rip will be good for it.

1/12/2022,"A Queensland coroner has recommended the state’s police force review the use of a controversial neck hold after an inquest into the death of an Aboriginal man in custody. The 39-year-old, known as Noombah or Noomba for cultural reasons, died in February 2018 after his long-term partner called police concerned he was going to kill himself.  He suffered a heart attack shortly after a struggle with two police who came across Noombah while driving to another incident near his house in Townsville. State coroner Terry Ryan found Noombah died of cardiac arrest in the context of being restrained, pre-existing heart disease and inhaling petrol in the hours before his death. The coroner found the actions of police officers Zachary Schembri and Shane Warren were lawful, authorised and justified in the circumstances and were not in breach of any police policy or procedures. Guardian Australia revealed in March last year that one of the officers said in a police interview shortly after the death that he had used a lateral vascular neck restraint (LVNR) hold while trying to restrain Noombah. The controversial hold is banned in other Australian and international jurisdictions and following the Guardian report Ryan requested Queensland police provide additional information to his office on LVNR training, how its use was governed, and its use in other jurisdictions. During the inquest, Schembri said he no longer believed he had used the hold during the struggle with Noombah. Ryan accepted that evidence in his inquest findings, published on Tuesday, but said the Queensland police service should review whether it continued to use the hold – and the training provided regarding its use. “I accept that a LVNR was not actually achieved in this situation, although that was how Const Schembri [initially] described the restraint he used,” Ryan found. “Irrespective of whether a lateral vascular neck restraint was activated in the detention of Noombah, there were conflicting views before the inquest about whether this type of restraint has a place in modern policing.” Ryan found the actions of Queensland ambulance service members who attended, however, “did not optimise Noombah’s chances of survival” after he suffered the cardiac arrest. The paramedics did not conduct a basic assessment of his vital signs or accurately record them, and after Noombah was found to be in cardiac arrest “the level of treatment was also suboptimal”, Ryan said. In his evidence, the Queensland ambulance service’s medical director, Dr Stephen Rashford, could not say if Noombah would have survived if the care provided to him had have been adequate. He said that in the most optimal circumstances about 25% of patients who arrest in the presence of paramedics do not survive. Ryan noted that neither of the paramedics who treated Noombah continued to practise. The Queensland ambulance service has apologised to Noombah’s family. In his other recommendations, Ryan said Queensland police should develop a mandatory requirement for police officers to request a priority response from the Queensland ambulance service when the demeanour of a person in custody “rapidly declines from a state of heightened emotion and agitation to one of apparent compliance”. This had occurred with Noombah, who Schembri had described as going from “100 to zero” very quickly. Under the recommendation, the process would be included in the police manual, and the mandatory request would require paramedics to conduct a medical assessment and monitor vital signs. Ryan also recommended the Queensland government work with Indigenous people in Townsville and other institutions to develop culturally appropriate referrals for “First Nations people in mental health crisis as an alternative to assessment in hospital emergency departments”.",News/Australia news,Queensland coroner clears officers after Indigenous death in custody but wants restraint reviewed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/queensland-coroner-clears-officers-after-indigenous-death-in-custody-but-wants-restraint-reviewed
1/12/2022,"Santos has been accused of failing Indigenous groups and treating one of the country’s biggest landholders with a “cavalier attitude” as it faces court action over a proposed expansion of its fracking operations in the Beetaloo Basin. Fracking in the Beetaloo Basin is being accelerated as part of the Morrison government’s gas-led recovery plan, and several companies, including gas giant Santos, are currently seeking to exploit the area’s natural resources.  But Santos has met well-resourced opposition in the Northern Territory supreme court from Rallen Australia, a company linked to the wealthy Ravazzotti and Langenhoven families, which owns huge swathes of land in the area through pastoral leases. The company has accused Santos of failing to meet strict obligations to disclose the proposed drilling of two additional horizontal wells on its land at Tanumbirini Station, near Daly Waters, in 2020, an expansion not allowed for under its existing environmental management plan. “At the very fundamental level, what this case is about is a cavalier attitude by a listed Australian public company to important disclosure regulations imposed on it by regulations designed to balance the interests of the miners and landholders,” Rallen’s barrister, Marcus Pesman SC, told the court this week. The court heard the company initially tried to convince the NT’s environment department it did not need to revise its environmental management plan to account for the two new wells. But the department disagreed, saying the new wells posed a “significant” and new environmental risk. It told the gas giant to lodge an amended environmental plan, which it did. Despite having been told of the added risk, Santos allegedly did not tell Rallen, despite what Rallen says was a legal obligation to do so. “And what we would be saying to your honour, ultimately, is that any responsible corporate actor, having received this correspondence from the department saying the new activity you intend to undertake contains significant environmental risks, would have communicated those risks to Rallen,” Pesman said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Santos responded by saying Rallen, a well-resourced and sophisticated company, could reasonably have been assumed to have known about the revised plan. That drew a sharp response from Justice Judith Kelly, who said: “But how on Earth is anybody supposed to comply with a requirement to give a stakeholder information about the regulated activity that the interest holder proposes to carry out, the locations where it’s – this is very specific – where it’s proposed to carry out the activity; and, importantly, the anticipated environmental impacts and environmental risks of the activity, and the proposed environmental outcomes in relation to the activity, and the possible consequences of that activity, if you don’t tell them?” The hearing is continuing this week. Outside court, the Nurrdalinji Native Title Aboriginal Corporation also accused Santos of not properly informing traditional owners about the expansion. Johnny Wilson, the group’s chair, said Santos was stopping traditional owners from “knowing the true story what is happening on country”. “It’s not just the pastoralists that Santos is failing to properly consult with, it’s also our people,” Wilson said. “Fracking wells risk the water systems that connect our country and people together. Our songlines go through these waters. We have a heavy heart thinking about what will happen if things go wrong when Santos does its mining.” Nurrdalinji is a recently formed group and says it includes traditional owners from Tanumbirini. The Northern Land Council is the relevant statutory authority under the Native Title Act empowered to speak on behalf of traditional owners. Santos said it could not comment while court proceedings were ongoing.",News/Australia news,"Santos was ‘cavalier’ over Beetaloo Basin fracking expansion, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/santos-was-cavalier-over-beetaloo-basin-fracking-expansion-court-told
1/12/2022,"Authorities in several Australian states have reintroduced mask mandates as a result of the recent surge in Covid cases. Earlier in the pandemic, amid PPE shortages for healthcare workers, the public was encouraged to wear reusable cloth masks or surgical masks, while P2/N95 respirators were not recommended for community use.  But the Omicron variant’s increased transmissibility has prompted the question: should you consider switching your reusable mask for a respirator instead? The latest guidance from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, published in November, suggests “individuals choosing to wear masks in the community may use any type of well-fitted mask”. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is considering changing its guidance to suggest that people who can consistently wear N95s instead of cloth masks should do so, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday. “It’s very important that with Omicron – it’s just so transmissible – that people wear the best quality mask they can,” said Dr Karina Powers, an occupational health physician in Western Australia. “Cloth masks are not enough: there are either not enough layers to filter out the viral particles or the weave is too loose,” she said. Surgical masks, like P2/N95 respirators, are made from three layers of meltblown polypropylene, and contain an electrostatic charge that traps particles being breathed in or out. However, surgical masks were initially designed for “source control” – worn by doctors and nurses to minimise the risk of contaminating a surgical area or infecting their patients. “They’re not designed to protect [the wearer] from airborne disease,” Powers said. Hassan Vally, an associate professor in epidemiology at Deakin University, said that studies on previous Covid variants show that an N95 mask is better than a surgical mask, which is better than a cloth mask. “If you’re in a higher risk situation, you want to be wearing the best mask you possibly can,” he said. Respirators sold in Australia must meet minimum protective standards. The P2 class of respirators is certified in Australia as filtering 95% of small airborne particles, and is essentially equivalent to the N95 standard set by NIOSH, the US’s occupational safety body. “It’s not the exactly same, but for all intents and purposes, it’s very similar,” said Prof Malcom Sim, president of the Australasian Faculty of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. KN95s are manufactured in China, with an equivalent standard set by the Chinese government. The CDC estimates, however, that about 60% of KN95s available in the US are counterfeit products that don’t meet NIOSH standards. “Very few of those are accepted for use here in the industrial environment, because they don’t quite meet the Australian standard that we have for P2 respirators,” Sim said. KF94s are manufactured in South Korea to meet a regulated standard. The respirator stands for “Korean filter” with a 94% filtration rate. Powers says ideally the government should provide everyone with free P2 masks. “So many [people] either don’t have access or don’t know how to find these or they’re not available in the chemist.” “This has been an airborne disease all the way along, and really we should have had supply from the beginning,” she said. “We will be far quicker at cutting outbreaks of disease and preventing large outbreaks starting if we are readily able to have access to these masks when needed.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Sim believes P2 class respirators are less useful for the general public than in specific workplace settings such as hospitals. “They’re not designed for general use out in the community,” he said. “You need to be trained in how to use them, they need to be fit tested for them to perform at their proper level of protection, and they’re not really designed for taking on … [and] off.” “I think we should be putting the emphasis on other prevention measures: sitting outside, density limits, being very careful in your own household with inviting people around,” Sim said. Vally agrees that the protection of P2 respirators is only useful if properly worn. “There’s no point in having that increased cost … if they’re not worn properly and they don’t actually work in the way they’re supposed to.” Sim is also concerned about potential supply issues if there is a rush on respirators by the general public. “I think that could cause a squeeze in the health and aged care sector.” “We continue to offer a range of P2 respirators for our retail and commercial customers,” said Ben Shanley, a category manager at Bunnings, in a statement. “Overall we’re not experiencing any widespread product availability issues at this time.” Prof Trent Twomey, the national president the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, said the Omicron variant had “sparked renewed demand” for P2 respirators. “Clearly P2/N95 masks are preferable to cloth but any mask is better than none,” he said. When used by healthcare workers, surgical and P2 masks are supposed to be thrown away after a single use. Powers says people in the general community can re-use P2 respirators. “You can drop your risk of transmission of Omicron by simply wearing the respirator and putting it in the sun, drying it out. You can keep using it … until the elastic breaks.” Peter Tsai, the inventor of the N95, has previously recommended buying seven of the respirators and rotating them daily, so that virus particles have time to become inactivated in the week between a mask being used twice. It’s important to note that washing single-use masks with soap and water, or sanitising them with alcohol, significantly decreases how effectively they can filter particles. Overseas, researchers have found that N95s can be reused at least 25 times after being decontaminated with vaporised hydrogen peroxide, without compromising their filtration system. However, while this could be useful in the healthcare setting, it’s not an accessible method for personal use.",News/Australia news,Respirators or cloth?

1/12/2022,"A Labor government will revamp the $4.7bn emergency response fund to commit up to $200m a year to disaster prevention and resilience, as leader Anthony Albanese sharpens his attack on the Morrison government for failing to plan. Making the announcement ahead of a visit to Mackay in Queensland on Wednesday, Albanese said Labor would use interest from the fund, which is managed by the Future Fund, to improve Australia’s disaster “readiness”.  Proceeds from the fund would go towards prevention measures such as flood levees, sea walls, cyclone shelters, evacuation centres, fire breaks and telecommunications improvements. “Thousands of Australians who face bushfires, floods and cyclones every year deserve to be protected by a federal government who plans ahead and invests to keep them safe,” Albanese said in a statement. “These investments will literally save lives, not to mention the taxpayers’ funds that have to be spent on recovery and repairs when disasters hit. “Australians are renowned as the best disaster responders in the world. They deserve to be backed by a government that looks forward, plans and prevents the worst.” The redirection of the fund towards resilience and mitigation measures draws on recommendations made in a 2015 productivity commission report which looked into natural disaster funding arrangements in Australia. The report, which was ordered by the then treasurer Joe Hockey, found that governments “overinvest in post-disaster reconstruction and underinvest in mitigation that would limit the impact of natural disasters in the first place”. “Current government natural disaster funding arrangements are not efficient, equitable or sustainable. They are prone to cost shifting, ad hoc responses and short-term political opportunism,” the report found. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The government established the emergency response fund in 2019, with the funds to be spent on recovery and mitigation, but none of the fund has so far been spent with the government referring to it as a fund of last resort. In the 2021 budget, the government announced a similar fund called the Prepare Australia fund, which committed $600m over six years for disaster resilience measures. Labor accused the government of continuing to sit on the emergency respond fund which had “done nothing to help” prepare the country for natural disasters. “Three years after it was announced, the ERF has not spent a cent on disaster recovery and has not completed a single disaster prevention project. The only thing it has done is earn the government over $750m in investment returns,” Albanese said. “As with Covid-19, the Morrison government’s failure to plan and prepare for natural disasters has left Australians vulnerable. “It doesn’t have to be this way. We know weather events are on the horizon – we have the smarts and the resources to prepare and prevent.

Labor said it would continue to fully fund disaster recovery through existing arrangements and would improve the efficiency of disaster recovery processes, “to simplify and speed up payments to disaster victims and repairs to damaged infrastructure”. Albanese, who is midway through an eight-day “Better Future for Queensland” tour, will spend a second day in the seat of Dawson on Wednesday, visiting a canegrower and the local Country Women’s Association. Dawson is held by the LNP’s retiring MP George Christensen on a 14.6% margin. The opposition is using the Queensland trip as a test run for the election campaign, with Labor needing to build on the six of 30 seats it currently holds to try to win government. Grilled about the performance of the party in Queensland at the last election during his trip, Albanese said it was clear Labor did not get enough votes right around the state. “One of the things that I’ve been determined to do is to make sure that we do better right around Queensland,” he said. “We’ve learned the lessons. We did a whole review into it. And what we didn’t do was show that in terms of our policy offering, (that) wasn’t strong enough to secure the support of people in Queensland.”",News/Australia news,Labor pledges to boost Australia’s disaster readiness with revamp of $4.7bn emergency response fund,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/labor-pledges-to-boost-australias-disaster-readiness-with-revamp-of-47bn-emergency-response-fund
1/12/2022,"Australia’s promised supplies of 51m doses of the Novavax vaccine, which failed to arrive in 2021 as planned, may be approved within months after the company finally completed its approval applications with the health department. The protein-based vaccine, which was initially intended to be available as a primary vaccine for the entire Australian population last year, has earned the nickname “Never-vax” within the health department because of the ongoing setbacks.  After providing initial data to the Therapeutic Goods Administration in January 2021, the company provided the government with its “complete submission of data and responses” last week. The Advisory Committee on Vaccines (ACV), which advises the TGA and the health minister, met to review the Novavax vaccine on Friday. The TGA is now preparing to review the committee’s final report. “Once the ACV’s final report is received and reviewed by relevant parties, the TGA will be in a position to make a decision,” a spokesperson for the Department of Health said. “The Novavax vaccine candidate will not be rolled out to the Australian public until the TGA has completed a full and thorough assessment. No part of this process has been rushed, and the TGA will not approve a vaccine unless it is found to be safe and effective.” The department noted that the supply of Novavax vaccine after approval would still be dependent on products arriving in Australia and meeting laboratory batch release requirements, noting problems faced by the company last year. “Throughout 2021, Novavax publicly indicated that there were delays in their regulatory submissions due to a series of vaccine manufacturing and supply issues,” the spokesperson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Speaking after Novavax sent its first shipment of its vaccine into the European market this week, the company’s chief executive, Stanley Erck, said the company had marked a significant milestone and was expecting Australian government approval within the next three months. “There’s a lot of pent-up demand for our vaccine,” Erck told Bloomberg TV on Monday. “We’re waiting for … approvals within the next 30, 60, 90 days from places like Australia, Canada, UK, and hopefully the US in that time period. So it’s a big transition for the company.” In response to questions from Guardian Australia, Novavax said the TGA was now “actively evaluating” the data it had submitted in January, and said the company had made “remarkable progress” developing and securing approvals for its vaccine. “Novavax are working closely with the TGA on the submission and are hopeful the regulatory evaluation will be completed shortly,” the spokesperson said. “Once completed we will work with the TGA and federal government on the quantities and delivery schedule for the vaccine.” When asked about the reasons for the delayed supply, the company said it believed “the important thing is to look forward and focus on how quickly we have got here”. “We have spent the last year and a half conducting multiple late-stage trials with over 45,000 participants, creating our supply network, conducting tech transfer, and refining and validating our analytical methods and dealing, as all manufacturers have, with global raw materials shortages.” The health minister, Greg Hunt, insisted repeatedly last year that the company was still on track to deliver on the contracted supplies for Australia in 2021, dismissing reports of ongoing delays as “incorrect”. Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations which use mRNA technology, the Novavax vaccine is a subunit protein vaccine, which uses a harmless part of the virus to trigger an immune response. The head of the country’s vaccine taskforce, Lt Gen John Frewen, said that he believed there were a number of people who had been holding out for the Novavax vaccine. “There is a group of people who are holding out for Novavax, so I think when Novavax eventually comes we will pick up maybe a couple of extra percentages there as well,” he said. In November, Hunt agreed that some people were waiting for Novavax, promising Australia would be one of the first countries to start administering the drug. “It may not be a full 2% exactly, but we do know that there are some people … who are waiting. Whilst we would advocate they don’t wait, I know that some will nevertheless make that decision, and I respect that,” Hunt said. Latest government data from Operation Covid Shield shows Australia’s vaccination rate, for those over the age of 16, is sitting at 94.7% for first dose and 92.1% who are fully vaccinated. Novavax was one of the three vaccines that the government prioritised in its initial vaccine procurement strategy, with the prime minister announcing in February last year that supplies would be “sufficient to vaccinate every Australian who chooses to be vaccinated in 2021”. The government continued to suggest the Novavax supplies would arrive in the third quarter of last year until the vaccine was dropped from the “horizon allocation” vaccine rollout strategy when it was released in June.",News/Australia news,Novavax vaccine may be approved for Australia within months,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/novavax-vaccine-may-be-approved-for-australia-within-months
1/12/2022,"Large swathes of the disability service sector have been forced into Covid isolation, leaving some clients without access to vital services, while a major provider has only been able to source seven rapid antigen tests for its entire workforce in one state. The peak body for National Disability Insurance Scheme providers, National Disability Services, told Guardian Australia up to 20% of staff at some organisations were in isolation, mirroring the Omicron-fuelled workforce shortages in other sectors.  Anger is also brewing among providers who say they’ve been left to compete for rapid antigen tests with other businesses and the general public, in part because they do not have priority access to the national stockpile like their aged care counterparts. Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday that despite this access, aged care providers were also struggling to obtain the tests from the federal government. “Disability services are under increasing pressure at the moment,” said the chief executive of National Disability Services, Laurie Leigh. “A number of staff are being furloughed or required to isolate following either [becoming] a positive case or being in contact [with one]. It’s causing additional strain and stress on what is already a system under strain.” NDIS provider Able Australia, which operates group homes and day services, has obtained a total of seven rapid antigen tests for Tasmanian staff. “We’re in the rest of the queue with the general public, which is really disappointing as a disability service provider,” the national director of engagement at Able Australia, Chandi Piefke, said. “We’ve actually had to ask our teams to hit up every pharmacy they can to get [rapid tests]. After putting that big call out we managed to get seven. We’re not talking seven packets, we’re talking seven individual tests. For a state that has over 100 staff and [100] clients, that’s simply not good enough.” Piefke said it was “quite ludicrous we’re into year three of the pandemic and we’re finding ourselves in this position”. “The standard channels which apply to health and aged care don’t seem to be available to the disability sector, which is really disappointing,” she said. National Disability Services is calling on the federal government to give support workers priority access to rapid antigen tests or PCR testing. Leigh said “having access to free [RATs] would make a huge difference”. Samantha Connor, the People With Disability Australia president, said last week that half of all people with disability in Australia lived in poverty and that many were keen to be tested regularly – and also have their support workers tested. She said it was not feasible for many to pay $15 a test when they had large teams of support workers. Her comments came as Guardian Australia reported how some people with disability were turning to a mutual aid fund in order to afford tests. While the government last week announced it would grant some free rapid tests to concession card-holders, including people on a disability pension and some on other payments, this will still exclude some NDIS participants. At the same time, some people with disabilities are missing out on vital services because workers are being forced into isolation, sometimes at short notice. Leigh said she had “anecdotal data saying anywhere between 10 and 15%, up to about 20% of their workforce may be affected at any one time”. Heather Renton, the chief executive of Syndromes Without A Name, which supports families of children with an undiagnosed or rare genetic condition, said some had reduced services or stopped them altogether. This was either due to staff being in isolation or because the families felt it was too risky to have support workers attend the house. “They’ve got the question, ‘Do I let support workers into my house and risk getting Covid into the house, or do I just struggle by and have these sleepless nights and be totally exhausted because I’m not getting a break?” Renton said. “Sometimes they need two people to shower the child, depending on the child’s age. It’s had a huge impact. A lot of support workers work in multiple places, a lot are off sick.” Renton, whose daughter has a rare genetic condition, has limited the number of support workers who could come to the house, meaning care had been reduced. “We have a carer who works in a number of places and we’re not having her care for our daughter at the moment,” Renton said. “It will impact her mental health.” Laura Green, the executive director at NDIS provider OnCall, which has about 2,000 disability support workers in Victoria and Queensland, said 2% of her staff had Covid and 7% were in isolation. “Every day is an absolute battle to look at what people need from you that day,” she said. Green said OnCall, which also provides workers to other providers, said there was “two to three times the demand for short-notice shifts, which tells us it’s happening across the sector”. Asked if the situation was the worst it had been through the pandemic, Green said “undoubtedly”. Piefke said the situation for Able Australia, which operates in Tasmania, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland, was broadly in line with the anecdotal evidence of other providers, meaning 10-15% of its workforce was in isolation at any time. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The National Disability Insurance Agency has previously said people in NDIS-funded supported independent living accommodation (SIL) and their providers could claim $12.50 per rapid test. There are about 25,000 SIL participants, but nearly 500,000 people in the NDIS. In a position paper released on Monday, the Centre of Research Excellence in Disability and Health warned there was “limited supply of rapid antigen tests, which are essential for ‘screening’ workers before they provide support”. It called for priority and free access for workers.",News/Australia news,Covid-related staff shortages in Australian disability sector leave some without vital services,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/covid-related-staff-shortages-in-australian-disability-sector-leaving-some-without-vital-services
1/12/2022,"Novak Djokovic has claimed victory in one court, and is back on one more familiar. But as he prepares for the Australian Open at Melbourne Park, he does so with a Damoclean sword hanging above his head.  Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, a close ally of the prime minister, is uniquely vested with extraordinary powers: at any time, with the stroke of the ministerial pen, he can end Djokovic’s right to stay in the country, and ban him for three years. Within government, these are known as the “God powers”, and their use – and misuse – has been controversial for decades. “I have formed the view that I have too much power,” a former holder of the immigration portfolio, Senator Chris Evans, said more than a decade ago. “I am uncomfortable with that, not just because of concern about playing God, but also because of the lack of transparency and accountability for those decisions and the lack in some cases of any appeal rights against those decisions.” Since Evans aired those concerns to the parliament, successive governments have falsely conflated migration with terrorism, or criminality, to justify more and more extreme powers. Australia’s federal court docket is quietly filled with dozens of challenges to visa cancellations. Rarely are they as fortunate as Djokovic: backed by money, institutional support, media attention, and a legal team in the multitudes. The worst-case scenario he faced was the abandonment of a tennis tournament (albeit a significant one). But for a refugee arriving in Australia seeking protection, without money or resources, without English or knowledge of Australia’s arcane migration law, what prospects for a successful conclusion? The glimpse of the government’s actions in the Djokovic case illuminate the capricious and arbitrary attitude taken by the Australian government towards people seeking entry. Australia is unique among liberal democracies for indefinitely detaining asylum seekers (though only those who arrive by boat). There are, right now, as Djokovic practises on Melbourne Park’s courts, refugees who arrived in Australia as children – whose claim for protection has been formally recognised – who have been stranded in detention for nine years. A childhood wasted, an adulthood formed in unjustified incarceration. There are stateless people – who have no country to which they can return – who have been detained more than a decade. For them, there is no swift resolution, no flag-waving supporters in the street, no presidential intervention, rapid court hearing, or forensic media glare. For them, it is only the slow, grinding demoralisation of a potentially limitless incarceration. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Australia’s detention regime is damaging, psychiatrists, the United Nations, and those running the regime itself, have repeatedly warned. The uncertainty of indefinite detention, the Australian government has been forced to recognise, is even more harmful. Visa cancellations, either at the border or in the community (as two others involved in the Australian Open have discovered), are commonplace. The government routinely cancels visas on so-called “character grounds”, powers are used against those convicted of serious crimes, or those believed to pose a threat to Australia. But these extraordinary powers, in certain cases unchallengeable, are also often misused. Some in Australia have had their visas cancelled for committing no crime at all. A stateless man acquitted of a murder wrongly alleged against him had his protection visa cancelled regardless last year: he faced detention for the rest of his life. Another man, 35, who had lived in Australia since the age of one, had his visa cancelled, and faced deportation to New Zealand, for belonging to an outlaw motorcycle gang that was not outlawed in the state where he lived. His behaviour was “entirely lawful” the minister was forced to concede. In both cases, the federal court (the same court in which Djokovic fought his case) intervened, after months of detention and uncertainty, to find, in the latter case, that the minister’s decision was “baffling”, “irrational and illogical” and “legally unreasonable”. The Djokovic case, too, has exposed a global apartheid around movement. Before the global pandemic, for those with the right passport, or enough money, free movement had become an expectation, a right that could be relied upon. For those without – many fleeing war, famine, persecution, or natural disaster – the world was a tightly constrained place, borders were hardened against them, with promises (and realities) or walls or armed guards, with forced deportations or boats being forced back to sea. “Djokovic’s detention and subsequent speedy appeal process contrasts starkly with the ongoing and prolonged inhumane treatment of refugees in Australia’s migration system,” Refugee Council of Australia chief executive Paul Power said. “Refugees seeking asylum in Australian airports don’t even get access to lawyers before they are put on the next flight out of Australia, let alone a chance to argue their case.” That Djokovic was momentarily hotel in the same hotel as refugees now in their ninth year of indefinite detention made that contrast all the more stark. Much has been made of the “Fortress Australia” mentality that has emerged into public prominence with the coronavirus pandemic. But the isolationist streak runs far deeper. In its incompetent handling of Djokovic’s case, the Australian government has exposed not just one bizarre case, but systemic, structural flaws in the way Australia treats those who arrive on its shores. Nation-states have the legal right to determine who crosses their borders. But there is an obligation that they treat people fairly, act reasonably, and without duplicity. In comparison to his colleagues, Djokovic is not popular in Australia. His anti-vaccination stance seems, to many in a population that is highly vaccinated and has been repeatedly locked down, irresponsible, entitled and arrogant. The Australian government might have sought to make an example of the world’s best male tennis player, as a demonstration that, as the prime minister said, “rules are rules”.
