12/31/2021,"New South Wales daily cases have likely exceeded 25,000 a day, a month earlier than the government was predicting a fortnight ago, an acceleration likely to bring forward the strains on the health system, experts say. The NSW government reported 21,151 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, almost a 90% jump on the previous day’s tally. Kerry Chant, the state’s chief health officer, said in a video briefing it’s “likely” the increase is higher than reported.  Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University said tests were probably catching about 80% of actual cases, meaning NSW will already be at the 25,000 cases a day rate flagged by health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December. Lydeamore said it remains unclear how much the surge is a result of the catch-up of a testing system that itself has been under strain with people who have been symptomatic for a couple of days before Christmas only coming for checks now, or a wider spread of the infection. “If it’s the former that’s better news,” he said. On Friday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a further change to the testing rules for confirmed Covid cases. “Further to national cabinet on 30 December 2021, and following further consultation with the chief medical officer and chief health officers, leaders have also agreed to remove the requirement for a day six RAT for confirmed cases in isolation,” Morrison said in a statement on Friday. “If confirmed cases remain symptomatic, they should remain in isolation. Anyone with symptoms will continue to seek a PCR test.” The change appears to pave the way for confirmed cases to leave isolation on the seventh day without a test, so long as they do not have symptoms. Queensland reported a 40% rise in new cases to 3,118, while Victoria’s increase was about 15% to 5,919. With Melbourne’s temperatures already at 35C just after noon and on track for 38C with similar conditions forecast for New Year’s Day, it is likely many people will postpone testing to avoid waiting in the heat. Still, given the highly contagious nature of the Omicron Covid strain, Lydeamore said he was “pretty sure [Victoria] will end up in exactly the same place in a few weeks time” as NSW. NSW Health corrected its hospitalisation tally to 832, or 15% higher than a day earlier, with 69 patients requiring intensive care. Six people died in NSW from Covid in the 24 hours, all aged between their 60s and 90s. Lydeamore predicted hospitals would start to toughen standards so that fewer less seriously ill patients get admitted and speed up discharges to create capacity for the coming increase of those needing care. “Certainly the NSW system is going to be quite stretched over the next period,” he said.

It’s going to be tight, I think.” Gerard Hayes, NSW state secretary of the Health Services Union, said the system was now operating like a “winter bed strategy” for flu. “It’s still early to tell but we’re not dealing with a fresh workforce,” Hayes said. “We’re dealing with a tired workforce and a workforce with very little redundancy attached to it.” The likely surge in patients will mean that hospital staff will need extra help, although so far there seems to be little planning for that, he said. Hayes said the ambulance service in the state had recently put on 200 university students because there was no slack in the system. “They are overwhelmed and they can’t necessarily provide service,” he said. “So I think the next six months is going to consistently see this.” “Governments of all persuasions have been cutting back on health consistently, and making it sort of virtually a just in time program,” Hayes said. Lydeamore said contact tracing is now of little use, with as many as 200,000 new contacts likely a day at current infection rates. Guardian Australia earlier this week reported on the scaling back of tracing. “The horse has probably bolted a week ago and we’ve only just looked in the stable,” he said. Even so, there are still ways to moderate the pace of spread of the infection, such as wearing a mask and limiting density of gatherings and the number of new interactions. “If I interact with the same group of 10 people every day, that’s far less risky from a transmission point of view than interacting with a different group of two for five days,” Lydeamore said. “So it’s kind of like that bubble concept that we had a long time ago.”",News/Australia news,"NSW Covid cases almost double overnight, raising pressure on health system",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/nsw-covid-cases-almost-double-overnight-raising-pressure-on-health-system
12/31/2021,"Work colleagues of confirmed cases, not just people who live together, may be classed as close contacts if a significant transmission event occurs, according to expert health advice cited by Scott Morrison to overhaul Covid-19 rules in Australia. Newly published advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee also went beyond health factors to justify the “pragmatic” changes to testing and isolation rules. It said it was a response to fast-increasing case numbers and “the living with Covid policy approach”.  The expert advisory panel – which brings together all state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly – said the changes would support “public health sustainability, social cohesion and economic recovery”. The AHPPC warned that previous testing rules were “placing considerable pressure on available laboratory resources”. On Friday New South Wales reported a record high 21,151 confirmed Covid cases, while Victoria reported 5,919, Queensland 3,118 and South Australia 2,093. The prime minister called for a “reset” to Australia’s pandemic response, describing the more infectious Omicron variant as a “game changer”. He said after a national cabinet meeting on Thursday that most states and territories would adopt a newly agreed definition of a close contact – with relatively Covid-free Western Australia a notable exception. But South Australia announced it would stick with a broader definition of close contacts. Morrison had said a close contact “is a household contact or household-like of a confirmed case only” – except in exceptional circumstances. “A household contact is someone who lives with a case or has spent more than four hours with them in a house, accommodation or care facility setting,” Morrison told reporters. However, the AHPPC statement appears to be more nuanced and does not mention the four-hour timeframe. The advisory group said in its statement: “Household or household-like contacts are the key group who should be required to quarantine as these individuals are the most likely to develop disease. “In addition, where a significant transmission event has been documented, those who were at this site or venue may be determined to be close contacts,” it added. “This may include worksites. Worksites and businesses are strongly encouraged to have business continuity plans in place to ensure workplace health and safety is achieved and outbreaks can be contained as quickly as possible.” The AHPPC said there was “still risk of transmission based on the nature of exposure for other contacts (such as in social, educational or workplace settings) who have had less extensive exposure to a case than household-like contacts”. “This group will not be required to quarantine, except in exceptional circumstances, and may be required to undertake other behaviours to decrease their risk of transmission to others,” it said. Morrison told reporters that the change to close contact definitions “and the complete abolition of the casual contact notion” would have a positive impact on staff shortages, particularly in the health system. But the AHPPC statement said other contacts who had potentially been exposed to a case but who were at lower risk of infection should monitor for symptoms and have a rapid antigen or PCR test if these occur. “All contacts should wear a mask when outside home, monitor symptoms and avoid visiting high-risk settings for 14 days following exposure to reduce their risk of transmission to others.” The AHPPC also warned that for the effective control of outbreaks, “different management approaches will be needed for contacts in closed, high-transmission settings, particularly when there are a large number of individuals at risk of developing severe disease”. This would include outbreaks in residential aged care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said his state would continue to define close contacts as not merely “household and household-like contacts and intimate partners”. The definition would also cover “those who have been in a setting where there has been significant transmission of Covid-19 (and there has been greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact)”. The SA announcement was interpreted as a departure from the nationally agreed definition. But it does not appear to clash with the AHPPC advice published overnight.

He said people needed to be aware “that you can still catch this disease if you’re not living with somebody, or in an intimate relationship” – and should monitor for symptoms. “That’s just a fact and people need to be aware of the risks associated with Omicron.” Dr Chris Moy, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association, said on Friday the national cabinet announcement was a “party trick” that meant fewer potentially infectious people would be identified as a close contact. What would have been better is to maintain the definition, and to adjust quarantine and testing requirements utilising more RATs to determine who is infectious.........BTW where are the RATs and where can I get one? Moy said on Twitter the move “defies the reality of who will actually become infectious, and unknowingly accelerate the propagation of Covid through the community”. But Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at the Australian National University, said the changes were a “reasonable” response to the current situation. “We don’t need zero Covid rules – what we need is practical rules that get the vast majority of people who are high risk [and] keep them away from others, but not expect that we’ll have zero risk,” Collignon told the Seven Network. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This disease is actually in the society, it’s going to be here for years to come. We need to adapt the rules so that we don’t, in fact, lose huge amounts of the workforce for little extra benefit.” Kelly said Omicron was “very transmissible” and there was “no doubt” case numbers would continue to rise. But he said data from South Africa – which had “the longest and most extensive experience” of the new variant – indicated a 73% decrease in severity of disease compared with Delta.",News/Australia news,"Covid transmission risk not limited to household contacts, Australian health panel warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/31/covid-transmission-risk-not-limited-to-household-contacts-australian-health-panel-warns
