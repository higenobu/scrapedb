3/4/2022,"The White House imposed new sanctions on Russian oligarchs and their families on Thursday, as Vladimir Putin showed no sign of de-escalating Russia’s devastating military attacks on Ukraine. Joe Biden said the sanctions will target those who “line their pockets with the Russian people’s money” as the Ukrainian people seek shelter from air strikes. “Our interest is in maintaining the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all of history, and I think we’re well on the way to doing that,” Biden said in a cabinet meeting. “Today I’m announcing that we’re adding dozens of names to the [sanctions] list, including one of Russia’s wealthiest billionaires, and I’m banning travel to America by more than 50 Russian oligarchs, their families and their closest associates.” The financial sanctions target at least eight Russian elites and their family members, in an attempt to prevent the oligarchs from transferring assets to spouses or children to circumvent the restrictions. Those sanctioned include billionaire Alisher Usmanov, a Putin ally whose super-yacht was just seized by German authorities, and Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for the Kremlin. The sanctions terminate the oligarchs’ access to the American financial system, while their US-based assets will be frozen and their property will be blocked from use. The State Department has also imposed US visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates. The White House has said the new sanctions are designed to put more pressure on Putin by targeting his inner circle of allies. “We want him to feel the squeeze. We want the people around him to feel the squeeze,” said the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki. The announcement marks an escalation by the Biden administration, which had already imposed sanctions on Putin, his foreign minister and some of the top executives of Russia’s largest companies following the invasion of Ukraine. Biden indicated in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday that his administration would crack down on oligarchs’ assets as part of the west’s efforts to further isolate Putin. “I say to the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who’ve bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: no more,” Biden said Tuesday. “We’re joining with European Allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.” The new sanctions came as the White House asked Congress for another $10bn in aid to Ukraine. Shalanda Young, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, said the money would be used to provide Ukraine with more defense equipment and emergency food assistance, as well as bolster enforcement of the sanctions against Russia. “Given the rapidly evolving situation in Ukraine, additional needs may arise over time,” Young said. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said Thursday that she supports including the funding for Ukraine in the omnibus spending package currently being debated in Congress. Pelosi also echoed demands to ban US imports of Russian oil, telling reporters: “I’m all for that. Ban it. Ban the oil coming from Russia.” But the White House has voiced a more skeptical opinion of sanctioning Russian oil companies, amid concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could drive gas prices higher. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,” Psaki said. “That would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people.” Any sanctions imposed by the White House may be coming too late for millions of Ukrainians. More than 1 million people have already fled the country because of the Russian invasion, and the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has begged for more assistance from western allies to end Putin’s airstrikes. “If you do not have the power to close the skies, then give me planes!” he said Thursday. “If we are no more, then, God forbid, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia will be next.” Ukrainian and Russian officials held another round of peace talks in Belarus, but they could only agree on establishing humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians. A phone call between Putin and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday yielded no major breakthroughs, and concerns are mounting over a large Russian convoy of tanks and artillery outside the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. The French Élysée palace said after the call: “We expect the worst is yet to come.”",News/US news,US to sanction Russian oligarchs as Putin shows no signs of de-escalating,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/us-russia-oligarchs-sanctions-putin-ukraine
3/4/2022,"Look on the bright side. It’s not that hard to be on the right side over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So the bar is quite low for a politician to be considered to have a good war. Just think what it would take to have a bad one. Which is why – more or less – Boris Johnson has made most of the right calls. If not always all at the right time. But it’s also quite tempting to indulge in politician envy. The Ukrainians voted for a comedian and got a leader. A man with an unerring moral compass. We in the UK also voted for a comedian and got exactly that. Except his act had long since stopped being funny. It never occurred to us that the world was going to get this serious. First Covid. Then this. We only signed Johnson for the good times and it’s far too late for buyers’ remorse. For now, unless Partygate and the Conservative party’s conscience catches up with him, we’re stuck with the Suspect. Only a couple of days ago he was all in favour of Ukraine joining the EU. Seriously. After years spent rubbishing it. Even in a war, he can’t resist gaslighting his own country. Again and again. Not content with breaking his own Covid rules, having piss-ups and trousering Russian donations, the Suspect ups the ante by giving a knighthood to Gavin Williamson. Presumably for services to fireplaces – Gav won salesman of the year in 2007 and 2008 – as it can’t be for anything he did in government. Williamson was the worst minister, a close-run thing with Chris Grayling, of his generation. Useless at defence – he told the Russians “to shut up and go away”: that worked – and a disaster at education. He was sacked from both gigs. But somehow he’s worth a K. Short of sticking two fingers up to the country, Johnson couldn’t have made his contempt for the UK more plain. Take sanctions. It would be much easier to believe Johnson when he says he is serious about going after Russian money if he didn’t have a track record as a serial liar. There again, maybe we just haven’t been listening to him carefully enough. And that by going after the money, he means pocketing as much of it as he possibly can. How else to explain why the UK has only sanctioned 11 Russian oligarchs, while the EU has now squeezed 680 individuals and counting? Or why the Suspect is so reluctant to clear the air by donating the £2m the Tory party has received from Lubov Chernukhin to a Ukrainian charity? Or why there has been no attempt to seize any Russian assets? Or, or, or. We all know that Boris can be bought: anyone for tennis? The only question is how much for. Still, Thursday was a day off for the Suspect so it was left to others to gloss over the mess he had left behind. Damian Hinds, the security minister, was first up on the morning media round and was summarily chewed up and spat out by Radio 4’s Today programme. Then Hinds did have the lost cause of trying to explain the government’s sanctions programme. It was like this. We were definitely a global leader in imposing the toughest penalties, which is why it made sense for us to be always a bit behind everyone else. In any case, it wasn’t a competition, he went on. And if we were to tell everyone what we were going to do before we did it then they would find ways to get round them. The BBC’s Simon Jack couldn’t believe his ears. He was dealing with a halfwit. Er … But you’ve already told everyone what you’re planning to do anyway, so any oligarch who hasn’t been sanctioned yet will be using the time to squirrel the money out of the UK. Hinds couldn’t quite cope with the logic and said nothing. “What about unexplained wealth orders?” said Jack. What about them? Hinds replied defensively. How many had the government put in place in the last year. The minister didn’t have a clue. Jack helped him out by informing him that the answer was a big fat zero. Hinds was triumphant. That proved how well they were working. There was currently no one in the UK with any unexplained wealth. Everything was totally above board. By now he was just a pool of water on the floor. His driver came along with a mop to take him away. Meanwhile, in Vilnius, Liz Truss was also talking about sanctions. Though not in a way that indicated she knew that it was her department that was responsible for imposing them. “Sanc-shuns are wor-king. Un-i-ted with U-kraine,” she said over and over again in that slightly robotic voice that suggests there is even less going on in her brain than first appears. Still, on the plus side, no one was there to listen so it didn’t really matter. The foreign secretary wasn’t even entirely sure why she was in Lithuania. Other than for the fact that she had to be somewhere and she might as well be somewhere Instagrammable than back in London. Then the foreign ministers of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia also looked as if they were wondering why she was there. She had come to offer her support to the Baltic states, she explained. Something she could just as easily have done by Zoom. None of the other ministers seemed that interested or grateful for the 200 troops she promised them. Rather they couldn’t wait for her to go so they could get back to talking among themselves. Also wondering how to fill her day was Nadine Dorries and the digital, culture, media and sport minister settled for making a statement about everything people already knew. Though she wisely recused herself from even thinking about sanctions on the grounds they were well above her pay grade. Instead, she listed all the sporting and cultural events that had already prevented Russian participation. Somehow in the retelling, she made it sound as if nothing would have happened but for her intervention. After also repeating that Russia Today was now blocked from British platforms, something unusual happened. Her voice choked and her eyes welled up as she praised the bravery of BBC journalists who were risking their lives to report from the frontline. This provoked gasps of surprise from MPs on both sides. Nadine had always been the BBC’s sternest critic. Dorries’s Beeb was full of biased, woke lefties churning out anti-Brexit propaganda and deserved to have its funding cut. Then this was Dorries in her compassionate, caring and conciliatory war mode. She was even polite to the SNP when they suggested it had been down to the EU that Russia Today had been blocked. Unprecedented. She also went on to show the love for Channel 4 – another first – before singling out Chris Bryant as an example to us all in his steadfast opposition to Vladimir Putin. That’s odd, said, Labour’s Kevin Brennan. He could have sworn the Tories had flooded the all-party parliamentary Group on Russia in an effort to get Bryant removed as the committee’s chair due to his hostility to Russia. Neither Vlad nor the Tories had found it useful for parliamentarians to be making life difficult for Russian kleptocrats. But that was then, and this was now. Everyone’s a democrat. Even Nad.

3/4/2022,"When the Winter Olympics closed on 20 February the main talking points were another Russian doping scandal and the International Olympic Committee’s controversial decision to award the Games to China. Fast forward just 12 days to Friday’s opening ceremony for the 2022 Beijing Winter Paralympics, and the Games will open under an entirely different geopolitical cloud. Here is some of what we can anticipate over the next week and a half in China. The Winter Paralympics are a modest affair compared with their summer counterpart – 78 gold medals are on offer across six sports between Saturday 5 March and Sunday 13 March, two events fewer than in 2018. Around 650 athletes from 49 nations were expected to compete before the IPC banned Russia and Belarus, and they will contest alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, biathlon, snowboarding, wheelchair curling and para ice hockey. The opening ceremony takes place at noon UK time on Friday 4 March. Ukraine have an excellent Winter Paralympics track record, with seven golds in Pyeongchang in 2018, and they finished fourth in the medal table in Sochi 2014, when they similarly competed during a Russian invasion of their homeland. Their full delegation of 20 athletes and nine guides is expected to reach Beijing and will compete in biathlon and cross-country skiing. Athletes had been warned before the Winter Olympics about making political statements that could upset the host nation, but we can anticipate a huge show of solidarity for Ukraine’s athletes from their peers. Team GB went into the Winter Olympics with a target of three to seven medals, and ended up with only two. The British Paralympians in Beijing have a chance to perform better – they won seven in Pyeongchang. This year the team are 25-strong, the biggest delegation since Lillehammer 1994, but Covid is a concern. Katie Guest, who would have been guide to the defending Paralympic slalom champion, Menna Fitzpatrick, has been unable to travel because of a positive test. Fitzpatrick will ski with a replacement guide. Millie Knight, who won two silvers and a bronze in South Korea, returns from serious injury to compete at her third Winter Paralympics but denies feeling pressure. “If we come away from these Games without a medal,” she has said, “that’s not going to be disappointing for us – it’s about performing well and being proud of what we’ve done.” China don’t have a huge pedigree in Winter Paralympics – having previously won only one gold medal – but the hosts have consistently dominated the medal table at the Summer Paralympics since Athens in 2004, and have invested heavily in advance of hosting. They are sending their largest ever Winter Paralympics delegation of 96 athletes to these Games. The snowboarders Sun Qi and Pang Qiaorong won world championship golds in 2019 and the standing skier Zhang Mengqiu won a World Cup gold in 2020 and are all medal hopes. The 44-year-old Zhang Haiyuan will race in the Alpine skiing for China, having previously won Paralympic gold in the long jump at Athens in 2004, while 28-year-old Jing Yu will become only the third woman to be part of a para ice hockey squad. If you enjoyed the aggression of the wheelchair basketball at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo then it is worth giving the para ice hockey your time. It’s a contact mixed team sport with players on sleds, playing ice hockey with an adjusted paddle that can be used to hit the puck at one end and manoeuvre on the ice with the other. The opening game on Saturday is a rematch of the 2018 final, featuring the US and Canada. Both will expect to meet again in the final. For a complete contrast there is wheelchair curling, once described as “chess on ice” by the Chinese star Yan Zhuo, who will be part of the host team defending their 2018 gold medal. “Our hopes for Team USA go far beyond medal expectations. The top priority remains making sure US Paralympic athletes have the support needed on all fronts – both mentally and physically – to perform at their best while living out their dreams,” the US chef de mission, Julie Dussliere, has said. However, the US topped the medal table in Pyeongchang and, with Russian athletes unable to compete, the path is open for even more than the 36 they won last time. The Ukraine-born Oksana Masters was unstoppable with two golds in para-cycling at Tokyo, and now she is in Beijing to defend her two cross-country skiing titles, saying: “I can’t wait to race for the two countries that make me whole.” Dan Cnossen is back, having won six medals including one gold in the biathlon and cross-country skiing last time. There is also sure to be a lot of attention on the “Eileen Gu of the Paralympics” – 20-year-old Katlyn Maddry was born in China but grew up in Alaska and represents the US in snowboarding.",Sport/Sport,"Brute force, raw emotions: six things lying ahead at the Winter Paralympics",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/03/brute-force-raw-emotions-six-things-lying-ahead-at-the-winter-paralympics
3/4/2022,"Zilina is a pretty town of squares and churches with a population of a little more than 80,000 that sits at the confluence of three rivers in the mountains of north-west Slovakia. It was, frankly, an incongruous place for a revolution in English football to begin, but it was there in 2003 that Chelsea played their first game under Roman Abramovich, a routine 2-0 win over MSK in a Champions League qualifier. Their last may come at Norwich in a couple of weeks, or perhaps at home to Brentford a fortnight after that, depending how soon a buyer emerges and how quickly the deal can be finalised. But it will be soon and, a couple of months after completing the full set of possible trophies by winning the Club World Cup, the Abramovich era at Chelsea will be over. The legacy he leaves is complex, not least because it is very hard to assess when it is still not clear why he bought the club. From a purely footballing point of view though, he brought Chelsea huge success. The temptation to point out that he took on a club that were fourth in the league, spent £1.5bn and leaves them third is strong, but Chelsea now are a very different club from the one he bought. They are no longer the flaky mavericks of the Kings Road, but an indisputable superclub. They had won the league only once before he arrived but he brought them five further championships, along with two Champions Leagues, five FA Cups and three League Cups. Might they have won more with more patience? Perhaps, but that is an enviable amount of silverware. He also changed football utterly. Chelsea beat Leeds 1-0 in the last game of Abramovich’s first season, after which Claudio Ranieri performed a slow, tearful lap of honour. Around £153m had been spent on players in that first year, £150m would be spent in the second – unprecedented sums at the time – and José Mourinho appointed manager. Seven miles to the north-east, Arsenal celebrated the completion of their Invincibles season with victory over Leicester. For them too, the future seemed ripe with possibility. Three months earlier, work had begun on a new stadium. With a capacity more than 50% greater than that of Highbury and an array of corporate facilities, this would allow them at last to compete with the financial might of Manchester United. The problem was, the world had changed. Chelsea didn’t need a big stadium; they had Abramovich. Spending power, suddenly, had become detached from success on the pitch or the capacity to generate revenue through vast crowds. Abramovich has always denied buying Chelsea for any reason other than love of football. That may be the case. But what is certainly true is that he paved the way for other owners whose wealth dwarfed that of even the most successful traditional owners, for the sheikhs and public investment funds whose interest in football was not winning trophies or even making money but massaging their public image. What happens next probably depends on who buys the club from Abramovich. Perhaps the process will be smooth, and Chelsea will simply swap one billionaire for another. But that is by no means certain. Much of Abramovich’s statement that the club is for sale was unclear. He may be writing off the £1.5bn the club owes him, but is that factored into the price? And could that leave the club liable for a substantial tax bill? And what would be the financial fair play implications of that? When he says “net proceeds” will be donated to a charitable foundation, net of what? There have been clubs sustained by a single wealthy owner before and it’s unlikely problems would be as severe for Chelsea as they were for, say, Blackburn, still less Gretna. The past 19 years have been an era in which their successes were broadcast across the world. They have a worldwide fanbase that should make them an attractive proposition. But the issue of the stadium is limiting. Hemmed in by a cemetery on one side and a railway line on the other, it is very difficult to increase the capacity of Stamford Bridge from 41,800, and various attempts to move over the past 20 years have come to nothing. A big stadium is not essential to a modern superclub, and it is certainly not sufficient to be one, but obviously the more revenue that can be generated on matchdays, the less burden there is on an owner. Other billionaires may not be so prepared to fund the club as Abramovich has been. There’s also the threat of a change to the loan system. Chelsea have 23 players out on loan, but have often in recent years had more than 40, largely as part of their policy of developing and selling young talent. From the summer the number of players a club can loan out will be restricted, which potentially cuts another source of revenue for Chelsea. The European champions may not be such an attractive proposition as they initially seem. With Chelsea’s future so uncertain, perhaps others will reconsider the wisdom of judging suitability for ownership purely on the grounds of wealth. At the very least, football should be contemplating the road that led from Zilina to this absurd situation whereby military decisions taken by foreign governments can have such an impact on an English club, and wondering what it could have done differently.",Sport/Football,Chelsea may struggle to find another Abramovich in a different world | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/03/roman-abramovich-exit-leaves-uncertain-future-for-chelsea-and-lingering-questions
3/4/2022,"Five years ago, Sara Pascoe and John Robins made standup shows about their breakup – both were good, but it was Robins’ that stuck in the mind, and won the Edinburgh comedy award. Why? Because, miserable though it otherwise is, being dumped makes for a more compelling story than doing the dumping. And so it proves again here, as Catherine Bohart – another casualty of a comedians’ romance gone south – turns her heartbreak into very engaging comedy. Compounding the anguish for Bohart was the backdrop of pandemic and lockdown against which she had to repair her wounded sense of self. This Isn’t for You tells the story of the Irishwoman’s journey from smug coupledom (the pair co-hosted a podcast about love and romance) via breakup and through a year of social isolation, in which her OCD spiked and her friends assailed her with terrible advice on emotional recovery. Or was it terrible? There’s learning here, as – after a show that pours entertaining scorn on “learn to love yourself” bromides – Bohart comes to an understanding of her own role in her romantic downfall. But it’s lightly worn. Healing is a factor in This Isn’t for You, in that laughing this much about the relationship and its end feels like a kind of triumph. But the focus is on the 33-year-old’s indignities and poor choices as she abases herself for love, takes out her romantic rage on a phonecall to BT and plots revenge with a drill-happy dentist. The mode is manic conversational, with the audience regularly consulted on the rights and wrongs of Bohart’s behaviour. The jokes are good, perhaps because the show underwent several rewrites as Bohart moved from bliss to desolation to acceptance without ever being allowed near a stage. On talking to herself throughout lockdown (“if you find yourself saying, ‘oh really?’, stop …”) and on the need for social rituals to terminate friendships, the show is as sharp as it is tender. Yes, inside stories of being dumped seldom struggle to engage an audience. But Bohart rewards that engagement with acuity, good cheer and a little hard-won wisdom in a show that’s worth holding on to. At Soho theatre, London, until 12 March. Then touring.",Arts/Stage,Catherine Bohart review – heartbreak comedy is a keeper,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/03/catherine-bohart-review-soho-theatre-london
3/4/2022,"But for an infamous fairway wood shot, which splashed into a Dubai pond to background screams of shock, Rory McIlroy would already have a 2022 victory to his name. The scale of anger writ large across McIlroy’s face after his late collapse at the Desert Classic will linger with anyone who witnessed it. McIlroy’s superb opening round of 65 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in Florida suggested he remains of a mind to right that Emirates Club wrong. McIlroy marched into an early lead where he has won once before, in 2018. Thoughts immediately and understandably turned towards what it would mean for McIlroy should he claim a tournament triumph before an annual trip down Magnolia Lane. “Regardless of when it comes in the season, it’s nice to win,” McIlroy said. “This is my fourth start of the calendar year. I’ve had one really good chance to win and probably one other half chance. I feel like I’m playing well enough to have chances to win golf tournaments, but all you can ask of yourself is to keep putting yourself in those positions on Sundays and then you see where your game really is. “Hopefully, this is another week where I put myself in a position where I can really see where my game is when the pressure is on.” Reflecting on Dubai, McIlroy admitted to mistakes when the watching world least expected them. “I did all the hard stuff right,” he said. “I made par on 14, par on 15, par on 16. Then you’ve got two gettable holes on 17, 18 and those are the holes where I made the mistakes. “So I did the hard part and whenever the opportunity came to sort of shut the door and win the tournament, I didn’t do that. That was what was most frustrating.” McIlroy’s day one at Bay Hill was most notable for an eagle putt, converted from 41ft at the 16th, his 7th. He returned six birdies and just one dropped shot. Ominously for the field, McIlroy’s putting looks back to its best. Graeme McDowell’s 68 was timely as he looks to catapult himself back towards golfing prominence. McDowell started this week as the world No 399. “I’ve been trending in the right direction,” he said. “I’ve been struggling to put it all together lately but there’s been a lot of good stuff happening with my game the last three or four months. Scores maybe haven’t suggested it but I played fantastic in Phoenix a couple weeks ago and just made nothing. Got off to a great start in Palm Springs and just didn’t continue it. There’s been a lot of really, really good stuff happening in my game.” Adam Scott, playing in McIlroy’s company, signed for the same score as McDowell. “Rory is a guy I can watch play and get positive swing thoughts for myself,” Scott said. “I love watching him swing a golf club.” Henrik Stenson was three under after five but had to settle for a 73.

3/4/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for direct talks with Russia’s Vladimir Putin as “the only way to stop this war”. The US and UK have announced additional sanctions on Russia. And more rain threatens the floods crisis in NSW. Concern is mounting over the movements of a huge column of Russian military vehicles outside Kyiv, amid a lack of fresh information about its position and the threat it poses. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that Kyiv’s “refusal to accept Russia’s conditions” means he will continue to pursue his war, the Élysée palace has said, adding: “We expect the worst is yet to come.” As the number of refugees fleeing the conflict passed a million and Russian forces, backed by heavy shelling, advanced on cities and key ports in the south and east, Russia’s president said in a 90-minute call to his French counterpart he was “prepared to go all the way”. Meanwhile, members of the public are paying for Airbnb rentals in Ukraine to help get money to residents. The world’s leading energy adviser said Europeans should turn down their thermostats by a degree to save on gas and reduce dependency on Russian imports. Macron has also warned that Europe must become more independent. Ikea has temporarily closed all stores and factories across Russia in a move affecting 15,000 workers, becoming the latest in a swathe of western firms to halt operations in the country. These efforts come as some countries scramble to speed up imposing sanction. Telecommunications problems are hampering flood rescues and recovery efforts in the NSW northern rivers region, with the Ballina mayor, Sharon Cadwallader, saying internet outages and patchy reception are the biggest issue for locals. Mobile internet coverage is almost nonexistent across large swathes of the region and phone reception is intermittent. Credit card payments cannot be processed, with most businesses only accepting cash. Some have been offering free food as a result, a welcome gesture in towns where supermarkets and shops have bare shelves. The veteran Liberal MP Warren Entsch has said the Morrison government should expand its $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover natural disasters – including catastrophic floods and bushfires – in other parts of the country. The flood has destroyed $5m of stamps, signalling the end for a small business. But though the floods are wreaking havoc on communities across NSW, scientists say describing them as “one-in-1,000-year” events (as Dominic Perrottet did) can mislead the public about the probability of such disasters recurring. Officials prepared talking points to help the government respond to questions about Tony Abbott’s trip to Taiwan, dismissing any suggestion the former prime minister’s visit represented a policy shift. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal the government was drafting its responses to potential media questions at least a week and a half before news broke of the former prime minister’s trip. Doubts have been raised about the United Australia party’s claim to have 80,000 members after more people complained about receiving emails welcoming them to Clive Palmer’s party, despite not signing up.

The cows are found washed up on beaches and, in Lismore, they’re cutting holes in the roof to escape the rising waters. In Sydney the rain won’t stop, while Perth experiences its hottest summer on record. Throughout the disorder comes the refrain: “When are we going to go back to having a normal summer?” Brigid Delaney explores why we cling to our memories of the perfect summer – before flood, fire and plague. But, she says, the past is gone and we have to wake up. There’s no correct amount of solitude, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith, but cultivating a relationship with yourself is the same as any other friendship. “Try not to think of solitude as just time spent with yourself,” she writes. “Try to think of it as something liberating: a chance to be what you aren’t around other people, and a chance to do whatever you’d like.” Barrie Kosky is known globally for breathing spectacular excess into old work.

3/4/2022,"Ukraine has announced it will issue non-fungible tokens to fund its armed forces, as cryptocurrency becomes an increasingly popular means of giving support to the government in Kyiv. Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s vice-prime minister, said on Twitter on Thursday that the government would soon issue NFTs to help pay for its military. NFTs confer ownership of a unique digital item – with pieces of virtual art proving particularly popular – upon their buyer, even if that item can be easily copied. Ownership is recorded on a digital, decentralised ledger known as a blockchain. Fedorov did not give further details of the NFTs but said the government had cancelled earlier plans to reward cryptocurrency donors with an airdrop, a free digital token typically used by the crypto community to encourage participation in a project. After careful consideration we decided to cancel airdrop. Every day there are more and more people willing to help Ukraine to fight back the agression. Instead, we will announce NFTs to support Ukrainian Armed Forces soon. We DO NOT HAVE any plans to issue any fungible tokens The move comes as a Ukrainian appeal for cryptocurrency donations passed $50m (£38m), after Fedorov posted a request for donations in bitcoin, ethereum and tether on Twitter last week.

The majority of the funds have gone to the government, with a smaller amount being sent to Come Back Alive, an organisation that funds the “real-time needs of defending Ukraine”. According to Elliptic there have been more than 102,000 cryptoasset donations since the start of the invasion last week, including a $5.8m donation by Gavin Wood, the British co-founder of the blockchain platform Polkadot. Elliptic added that a donation worth $1.86m appears to have originated from the sale of NFTs originally intended to raise money for Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder. A CryptoPunk NFT worth $200,000 has also been sent to the Ukrainian government. “The majority of donations received to date have been in bitcoin and ether, although US dollar stablecoins contribute a significant proportion,” said Elliptic this week. The company added, however, that scammers also appear to be piggybacking on the fundraising drive by tricking users who are attempting to donate to Ukrainian causes. The global NFT market reached $25.5bn last year, according to DappRadar, a firm that tracks sales, marking a meteoric rise from just $100m in 2020. The soaring value of NFTs has prompted warnings from sceptics that the craze for the tokens bears all the hallmarks of a speculative bubble. DappRadar’s head of finance and research, Modesta Masoit, said the Ukraine move was a “watershed moment” for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Ukraine has also raised more substantial sums through conventional means. Last week it raised £200m in a sale of war bonds and is in discussions with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank over raising further funds.",News/World news,Ukraine to issue non-fungible tokens to fund armed forces,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/ukraine-to-issue-non-fungible-tokens-to-fund-armed-forces
3/4/2022,"Gavin Williamson’s knighthood, announced by Downing Street on Thursday, has been condemned by opposition parties as a reward for failure, given the widespread criticism of his record as education secretary and mishaps in other roles. Here are some notable moments of his public ignominy. No one doubted that replacing exam marks with an alternative method of grading A-level students amid the Covid crisis in 2020 would be difficult. But Williamson was vilified, first for ignoring warnings that it would be a problem, and then, once the obviously unfair marks were in, for standing by the controversial combination of computer algorithm and teacher assessments. There was, inevitably, a U-turn 48 hours later, but by then much of the damage – both to students’ university chances and public confidence – had already been done. There is an argument that many of the main decisions regarding school closures and catch-up attempts were largely made in Downing Street. But teaching unions had little confidence in Williamson and his department over many associated issues, such as providing laptops and other technology to pupils who needed them, and helping schools become more Covid-secure once they reopened. Again, it was arguably the fault of Boris Johnson that the government twice held out against calls to extend free school meals or meal vouchers for poorer children into holidays, only to subsequently back down under PR pressure from Rashford, the Manchester United footballer and anti-poverty campaigner. However, it was Williamson’s department that was in charge. And it was very much Williamson’s fault when he told a newspaper he had held a Zoom meeting with Rashford, when in fact he had met a completely different black sportsman, the rugby player Maro Itoje. In another situation that would have permanently sunk the career of almost any other politician, Williamson was sacked as defence secretary in 2019 by the then prime minister, Theresa May, who had brought him into the cabinet, initially as chief whip. May said she had seen “compelling” evidence that Williamson leaked information from a meeting of the highly sensitive national security council about the involvement of the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei in the UK’s 5G network. Williamson conceded he had talked to the media, but denied that he had discussed anything about the meeting. It is fair to say that, before his sacking, some had worried that Williamson lacked the necessary gravitas to be defence secretary. This impression crystallised in March 2018 during a question-and-answer session after a speech in Bristol. Asked about the expulsion of Russian intelligence staff from the UK after the Salisbury nerve agent attack, Williamson condemned Russian actions before saying: “Frankly, Russia should go away and should shut up.”",News/Politics,Gavin Williamson – his blunders in full,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/gavin-williamson-his-blunders-in-full
