1/10/2022,"Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK’s Brexit party, has drawn sharp criticism, including from Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, after attacking Australia’s treatment of Novak Djokovic and travelling to Belgrade to visit the player’s family. Farage, who has long praised Australia’s strict immigration policies, on Monday tweeted his satisfaction after a judge ruled a government decision last week to revoke the tennis star’s visa was “unreasonable”.  The decision was “a huge win for @DjokerNole this morning”, Farage said, when Djokovic was released from immigration detention after winning his challenge to remain in the country and pursue his attempt at a record 21st Grand Slam title. Farage also told GB News that if – as he is entitled to do – the country’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, decided to intervene and withdraw Djokovic’s visa once more on different grounds, Australia would resemble a banana republic. “I mean, is Australia a country based on the rule of law, or is it a country where governments can exercise arbitrary power?” Farage said. “If that judgment this morning is overruled, what’s the difference between Australia and a banana republic?” A huge win for @DjokerNole this morning. If the Australian government fight this they will look dreadful. He said Australian authorities had used “really nasty tactics” against Djokovic, and called judge Anthony Kelly’s decision “the first really big victory” against “the big state which has grown so much over the past two years of the pandemic”. Britain’s former world tennis Number 1, Andy Murray, was among the more prominent critics, retweeting Farge’s video with Dokovic’s family and asking him to “please record the awkward moment when you tell them you’ve spent most of your career campaigning to have people from eastern Europe deported”. Clear now for sake of our national security as well as for social cohesion that we must Leave EU & have Australian-style immigration system. Djokovic, a long-term vocal opponent of mandatory vaccination, told border officials he was unvaccinated and had had Covid-19 twice, with the more recent positive test dated 16 December, according to a transcript of an interview with customs officials. The judge said it appeared Djokovic had received medical exemption from Covid-19 vaccination on the basis of that infection, and ruled the player was not given enough time to consult advisers so he could respond fully to the cancellation decision. Farage said he “believed firmly in freedom of choice” and if Djokovic had decided not to be vaccinated, that should be up to him. Australia’s immigration rules allow Hawke to use separate, personal powers to cancel the player’s visa as long as the minister is satisfied “a ground exists” to do so; that Djokovic can’t dissuade him of this; and that it would be “in the public interest”. Mary Crock, an immigration law professor, has said the country’s Migration Act gives immigration ministers “god-like powers” to cancel visas. “Everything that has gone before can be disregarded,” she said. “It is set up precisely for this situation.” Both before and since the Brexit referendum, however, Farage has consistently sung the praises of Australia’s tough immigration system, arguing that being able to emulate it was one of the main advantages for the UK of leaving the EU. “An Australian-style points system can be used to increase or decrease immigration numbers,” he tweeted in June 2019. “Does Boris Johnson want to reduce the numbers? I don’t think so.” In October 2015, he said: “If you want to take back control of your borders so that we can have an Australian-style immigration system, you have to vote to LeaveEU.” The following year, he tweeted that it was “clear now that for our national security as as for social cohesion we must leave EU and have Australian-style immigration system”. Please record the awkward moment when you tell them you’ve spent most of your career campaigning to have people from Eastern Europe deported.😉 https://t.co/rfFn1hdXlu Andrew Bridgen, a prominent Conservative Eurosceptic and long-term supporter of tougher UK immigration laws, tweeted his support for Farage’s view, saying the Australian government had “got itself into a real mess” over the Djokovic affair and “overruling the judge and deporting him now would … make it worse”. Asked if Djokovic should be allowed to compete at Wimbledon if he has not been vaccinated, the British prime minister, , Boris Johnson, said it was “important for the Australian authorities to make their own dispositions” adding: “I believe in vaccination.”",News/Politics,Andy Murray trolls Nigel Farage over Djokovic visa row,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/andy-murray-trolls-nigel-farage-over-djokovic-visa-row
1/10/2022,"“So, Mum/Dad, what are the railways for?” That is the question the UK rail industry will be dreading hearing in a post-pandemic world. This is not quite the existential crisis rail faced in the aftermath of the extensive Beeching cuts to the network in the mid-1960s, but that’s cold comfort. There is a considerable risk that services are going to deteriorate massively in 2022, sending the sector into the kind of downward spiral that was last experienced in the 1970s and 1980s.  By the financial year’s end, passengers may well be paying higher fares for a service of fewer and more crowded trains, departing from stations stripped of staff. And the result of that will be to push more people into using cars, but also to critically undermine the government’s “levelling up” promise, since poorer people are far more dependent on public transport. It’s a perfect storm. Unsurprisingly given the restrictions on travel and the instruction to work from home, revenue from rail fares dropped to a fifth of pre-pandemic levels during the 2020-21 financial year. The need to keep services running for key workers throughout lockdowns meant government subsidy rose from about £5bn to a very generous £17bn to prevent the network from collapsing. While this figure does include some modest investment to improve the network, that level of support will not be sustainable for long. The pandemic already led to significant change in the funding of the railways, when in September 2020, the franchise system created during privatisation in the mid-1990s was scrapped. Under franchises, private operators kept the fares, giving them an incentive to generate income through price increases and extra passenger numbers. Now the industry is being run through management contracts, which means the government effectively keeps all the fares but bears the risk if fewer people use the railways. The end of franchising was initially a temporary fix but has now become a permanent change as recommended by last year’s Williams-Shapps review of the industry. That review was already under way at the start of the pandemic – triggered by the chaotic May 2018 timetable change which resulted in widespread disruption because of the lack of coordination between operators and Network Rail. In light of the pandemic, its recommendations have led to the Treasury now demanding operators cut costs by 10% over the next year and a 3.8% fare rise in March, while the Department for Transport is looking at reductions to the timetable. But these cuts will have a severe impact on the level of service because the biggest spending areas for rail operators are on fixed costs such as station buildings, rolling stock and track maintenance, which are the same regardless of how many people use services. Other costs, such as fuel, electricity, platform staff and drivers are relatively low. The only way to save money is to dramatically reduce staff or to make severe inroads into the timetable, which will in turn impact revenue, creating a vicious circle. The unions are already preparing industrial action to combat these cuts, which will further disrupt services. At the same time, £500m is being spent on schemes to reverse some of the Beeching cuts. While that is welcome, reopening lightly used lines with an infrequent service seems an odd priority. Meanwhile, about £98bn may be spent over the next few years on HS2. This apparently contradictory position of building new services while existing ones are being cut reflects the Treasury’s view that capital expenditure is a “good thing” while operating expenditure, which by its nature recurs every year, is inherently “bad”. But this largesse in favour of HS2 is also putting the squeeze on other more modest enhancements and will result in a poorer service as temporary speed restrictions are imposed on dodgy sections of track. Escape from this perfect storm is possible. The Williams-Shapps report recommended the creation of a strategic body to oversee the railways, to be called, in a flourish of boosterism, “Great British Railways”. It will take over Network Rail, which is already state-owned, and provide a long-term plan for the railways. But as ever, the devil is in the detail. A government with a sense of history and an open mind would look to the British Rail of the past for a blueprint of how to run a successful railway. In its final decade before privatisation, it created three sectors – InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways – that had considerable independence in the areas of investment and timetabling. Allowing British Rail this freedom resulted in a blend of business imperatives backed by a strong public sector ethos that was successful. It became Europe’s most efficient railway. Sadly, all that was lost to privatisation, and while the collapse of the franchising system could provide an opportunity to recreate it, a continuing ideological obsession with private-sector involvement means that the increased costs and complexity that have characterised the railways in the past quarter of a century will remain. This matters for our transport system, but it matters more than that – because a good rail connection is a passport to prosperity. Look, for example, at how Margate has been transformed thanks to the half-hour reduction in journey time to London. As a corollary, look at how decline has been hastened in towns cut off from the rail network by Beeching. Railways have always been a catalyst of economic growth and prosperity, but politicians throughout history have often failed to recognise this. Some are commercially successful, some aren’t. So what? No one ever asks why the B-road to Nether Hopping should be kept open even though few cars use it on a daily basis. A properly funded, properly configured railway would cost a lot of money over the next few years until passenger numbers recovered, but railways are more than trains and tracks: they are an essential part of the fabric of the country. There is a moral case here, and politically there is the opportunity to make a popular case for a publicly owned, integrated railway – run independently of state interference. Labour should take it.

He has recently updated his book The Crossrail Story, and his history of British Rail will be published in June",Opinion/Opinion,UK railways are heading into a perfect storm.

1/10/2022,"Landlords who illegally dump the remains of cannabis farms will be traced using “smart water” spray in what is thought to be one of the first trials of its kind in the UK. Council officials in Bradford said they were taking action after a rise in the number of cannabis farms that had been fly-tipped in streets, along streams and in country lanes.  It is thought that landlords, rather than drug dealers, have been dumping the illegal waste following police raids. In a new approach to be approved by councillors on Tuesday, police officers will spray cannabis farms that have been shut down with so-called smart water so they can trace the drugs to a specific property if it is fly-tipped. The spray leaves an invisible marker on items or people so their movements can be more easily uncovered. It has been used by police in the UK to tackle domestic abuse and to ward off burglars. Officials at Bradford city council said they believed it was the first time such an approach had been used to tackle cannabis farm fly–tipping. They said in a report: “This is a new and innovative approach which we believe may not have been tried elsewhere in the country and clearly demonstrates the strength of the partnership between the council and the police to tackle environmental crime.” Environmental officers across the the UK have tried for years to tackle the dumping of illegal and harmful substances. Fly-tipping is a criminal offence under environmental laws and can be punished with unlimited fines or imprisonment of up to five years. The remains of cannabis farms are often dumped in rural locations under the cover of darkness, making it difficult to prosecute the culprits. Farmers and landowners often have to foot the bill to clear up the mess. In 2020, police surveyed more than 75 farmers and landowners in North Yorkshire about fly-tipping – 10 of whom reported having cannabis waste dumped on their land within the previous 12 months. One farmer said the remains of cannabis farms were being fly-tipped on their land every couple of months. In Bradford, bags have been found to contain dead cannabis plants, lamps, wiring and tubs of fertiliser. The council report, which is due to be discussed by its regeneration and environment scrutiny committee on Tuesday, said it collected 4,882 tonnes of fly-tipped waste and litter in the year from April 2020. Referring to cannabis, it added: “Over recent months, there have been a number of fly-tipping incidents that have involved cannabis farm waste.”",News/UK news,Bradford council to trace fly-tipped cannabis farms with ‘smart water’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/10/bradford-council-to-trace-fly-tipped-cannabis-farms-smart-water
1/10/2022,"There had been serious doubt over whether it would happen and even though it eventually did, many pondered whether it should have. In most other contexts this game would have been something to savour rather than to fret over, with Borussia Mönchengladbach the closest Bayern Munich have had to a bogey team during their near-decade of plenty, thus providing a worthy curtain-raiser for the Bundesliga’s Rückrunde. Perhaps there should have been some relief as Robert Lewandowski rolled Nico Elvedi before smashing home authentically, in time-honoured style, for the first Bundesliga goal of 2022. We had a storyline too, childhood Bayern fan Florian Neuhaus scoring with Gladbach’s first shot of the game and prompting an improbable comeback win for the visitors, and the merest soupçon of a title race to come.  Elsewhere in the Bundesliga there were plenty of other welcome indicators that it was business as usual – an Anthony Modeste headed goal for Köln, a thrilling match involving Borussia Dortmund in which the spectacle was almost entirely fuelled by, and their win achieved despite, their defensive incompetence – but this wasn’t quite the real thing. As Erling Haaland and Martin Hinteregger confronted each other as the Norwegian struggled to retrieve the ball from the net and get on with the game after Jude Bellingham’s equaliser for BVB, Haaland shouted at the Eintracht Frankfurtdefender that he was a “fucking idiot”, with viewers getting it loud and clear all over again in the echoes of the empty Deutsche Bank Park. There may have been amusement value at earwigging the players last year, but the novelty has worn off. On this opening weekend of the league’s second half of the season, it was impossible to escape the shadow of Covid-19. Bayern were at the heart of it and not just because of the long-awaited return of Joshua Kimmich, who stumbled into his well-documented vaccine controversy before Christmas and was fit and well enough to play for the first time since November (for the record, he “played outstandingly well in the first 75 minutes,” according to Julian Nagelsmann, before an understandable swell of fatigue in the game’s closing stages). For once, there could be no groaning about Kimmich being shunted to right-back. This was a genuine sporting emergency. On paper, Bayern’s line-up looked almost as formidable as ever, and casual observers might have wondered whether the midweek questions over whether the game could go ahead were overblown. Yet after a week in which players at the club’s Säbener Straße training base were separated into three different changing rooms to try and stop the spread, it was a clear case of next man up. Marcel Sabitzer was shoehorned into the left-back spot, the teenager Malik Tillmann given a first start on the left of midfield and Benjamin Pavard given a go at his preferred position of centre-back. There was even the sight of Paul Wanner, who only turned 16 on 22 December, stepping off a bench full of kids to become the youngest first-team player in the club’s history. It was a game that Bayern could, and probably should, have won – with Yann Sommer looking somewhere near his best in the Gladbach goal – and Nagelsmann had already embraced the challenge in the days leading up to the game. You could argue that not many coaches in his fashionable trainers would do the same, or that Bayern’s superiority has earned a level of comfort in which unfavourable conditions in a game are not a global difference-maker. Nagelsmann was blunt enough about his side’s culpability in the Gladbach equaliser, for example (“I don’t know why we’re defending it like that,” he told Dazn, exasperated), yet even he found himself incapable of avoiding the elephant in the room in picking apart the defeat. Sabitzer, playing a full 90 minutes for the first time in Bayern colours, was “dead after an hour” according to the coach. “Football is different from getting on the treadmill or running through the forest,” he added. It all felt, though, like detail rather than desperately important. The dreaded emptiness in the stands will take some getting used to again, though hopefully not for too long. The Geisterspiele – ghost games – were back and if a dearth of atmosphere doesn’t help football anywhere, it is particularly strongly felt in a league which counts noise and rancour from the stands as one of its greatest assets. There were spectators at Hertha’s game with Köln, with the Berlin senate allowing a 3,000 capacity at outdoor events – but by the time matchday staff and media had been admitted, that left room for 2,000 paying spectators. Better than nothing, perhaps, but a pretty sad sight in the Olympiastadion, which holds a touch under 75,000. The available tickets were raffled among season ticket holders, with 100 given over to the away side. This time, there is resistance to the concept as well. The Union Berlin president, Dirk Zingler, and Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke have both accused politicians of using football to score political points rather than really actioning what’s needed. While Bavaria’s state president, Markus Söder, took to Sport 1’s Doppelpass show on Sunday to defend Geisterspiele, and to detail that he was “totally annoyed” by a lack of national uniformity in German football’s approach, patience in boardrooms is wearing thin. Speaking to Der Spiegel last week, Watzke suggested that “with 8,000 spectators in our place (at the 81,000-capacity Signal Iduna Park), the risk of infection would be very slim, and everybody knows it.” With supporters still attending in bigger numbers in England, Spain and Italy, fatigue is not just an issue for on the pitch. “Every match behind closed doors costs us €4m,” continued Watzke. “It’s economically unbearable, and it also pulls apart the link between the club and the fans bit by bit.” If Söder is right to say that Germany is not out of the woods with the virus, then it’s also fair to point out that the Bundesliga has pandemic issues that still need addressing too. Friday: Bayern 1-2 Gladbach. Sat: Frankfurt 2-3 Dortmund, Freiburg 2-2 Arminia Bielefeld, Fürth 0-0 Stuttgart, Hoffenheim 3-1 Augsburg, Leipzig 4-1 Mainz, Leverkusen 2-2 Union Berlin. Sun: Bochum 1-0 Wolfsburg, Hertha 1-3 Köln.  Back on the field, Köln are thriving under Steffen Baumgart, with Modeste’s ninth (!) header of the season taking him up to 12 goals in the Bundesliga, setting his team on the way to a 3-1 win at Hertha and moving them up to sixth. What the Berliners would give for a touch of that upward mobility, though at least the loan move of Krzysztof Piatek (and his €4m annual wages) to Fiorentina might give sporting director Fredi Bobic a bit of latitude in the transfer market this month.  It could be worse for Hertha – they could be Wolfsburg. Florian Kohfeldt’s team are in freefall, losing at Bochum in Sunday’s late game to make it six Bundesliga defeats on the spin, and eight in all competitions. “We can’t be too dramatic because we still have 16 games to go,” striker Wout Weghorst told Dazn, “but we have to look at where we stand and change something really, really quickly.”  Wolfsburg are now in a relegation battle with, among others, Augsburg, whose new headline signing Ricardo Pepi made a debut as substitute in the loss at Hoffenheim (who, remarkably, are third). “We have to calm down a bit with him,” a protective Florian Niederlechner said of his new American strike partner.",Sport/Football,Bayern beaten as Bundesliga’s return is haunted by spectre of ghost games | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/bundesliga-covid-ghost-games-gladbach-dortmund-koln
1/10/2022,"Dairy and meat producers are pleading for more government help to cope with Covid disruptions in their industries as supermarket shelves empty and farm workers are hit by the virus. One big abattoir in South Australia has requested its staff return to work, despite 140 of them testing positive, while other farmers are facing filling milk vats or rotting produce as goods are held back from the market due to the lack of staffing.  Grant Crothers, president of the Australian Dairy Products Federation, said as many as 40% of workers in some parts of the dairy food chain were absent because of Covid or because they were close contacts. “We’ve obviously got an extremely time-sensitive raw material that relies on an excellent supply chain to get it to the processing point,” he said. “You can leave a cow in a paddock, you can leave grain in a silo, but you can’t leave milk in a vat on a farm.” Few dairy farmers would have more storage than about 1.5 days’ worth of milk production on their farms, Crothers said. Conditions had “changed dramatically” in the past couple of weeks, with the whole supply chain (including for exports) stretched or disrupted. “If you lose 24 hours, you’re in crisis mode because the milk can’t be stored on farm and therefore you risk dumping the milk, which triggers a whole lot of other issues around effluent and contamination of the waterways,” Crothers said. Meat producers were facing similar disruptions as every stage from trucking to deboning was being hit by staff shortages of varying levels, said Tim Kingma, a pig farmer near Echuca in northern Victoria. “One particular buyer of mine has over half their staff out with Covid.” “Australia has the meat,” said Kingma, who also heads the Victorian Farmers Federation pig group. “We’ve just got to get it to the plate.” In Kingma’s case, his farm would typically ship 600 pigs a week to market. “I’ve had to cut back 100 this week just because of the Covid issues,” he said. “They don’t stop growing. I can’t just put them out into the paddock to relax and forget about.” Both Crothers and Kingma welcomed changes announced on Monday by the Victorian government that will kick in from Wednesday 11.59pm, AEDT. Workers in the food sector, including supermarkets, may be exempted from close contact isolation requirements provided they are asymptomatic, undertake daily rapid antigen tests for five days and return a negative result prior to returning to work. The Victorian changes bring the state into line with Queensland and NSW. All states and territories, except WA, were expected to sign off on the changes on Monday. To work, though, they needed to be backed up by the supply of rapid tests to regional areas, Crothers said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In South Australia, Teys Australia has ordered back workers at its Naracoorte meatworks even if they are Covid positive. According to a notice to staff seen by Guardian Australia dated 9 January, the company said: “As per our call to you today – and as confirmed by SA Health – you are required to present for work tomorrow (Monday) as normal unless you are feeling unwell.” “This applies even if you have tested positive to Covid either by a PCR or RAT rapid test, and also if you are currently isolating because you are a close contact,” it said. Sharra Anderson, branch secretary of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union for SA and WA, said that almost 100 of the meatworks’ 400 staff had been infected. “This is absolutely disgusting. I’m absolutely gobsmacked,” Anderson said, adding that other abattoirs had just closed their doors when affected by Covid, rather than risking spreading the virus further. Staff will “go home to their family, who are also involved within the community” and give the virus to them. “It’s absolutely ridiculous,” Anderson said. Guardian Australia has approached Teys for comment. A spokesperson for the SA department of health said: “To ensure food security, SA Health has allowed a small group of critical staff who have tested positive and are asymptomatic, to continue to work in an isolated area away from others.” “These workers must remain at home and isolate when they are not at work until they are cleared from Covid,” the spokesperson said, adding SA Health had sent a Covid rapid response team to the abattoir in Naracoorte to test “all relevant staff”. “We are working closely with management to ensure the business can continue to operate safely and continue food production at the site,” the official said. Meanwhile, the Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) welcomed the response by federal and state governments to protect food supply chains. National cabinet on Monday endorsed interim guidance by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on permissions and restrictions for workers in food and grocery supply. “We welcome national cabinet’s endorsement today of the medical expert panel’s new set of arrangements, which allows workers who are close contacts to return to work if they have no symptoms and are fully vaccinated,” said AMIC CEO Patrick Hutchinson. Michael Coote, chief executive of the Ausveg industry group, said some growers were reporting staff shortages, particularly in the field and in packing sheds. “This is resulting in growers working longer hours, and in some cases redeploying staff to other areas of the business, to get product from the field to consumers,” Coote said. Growers were already under pressure to find pickers and packers because of visa restrictions. “Perishable products that have a limited shelf life are at most risk of disruptions across the supply chain, given the increased time that it can take for product to get from the farm to consumers,” Coote said. He said it was critical that essential workers who work in agriculture were able to continue to work if they test negative for Covid and are fully vaccinated.",News/Australia news,Australian food producers hit by Covid staff shortages welcome isolation rule changes,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/australian-food-producers-hit-by-covid-staff-shortages-welcome-isolation-rule-changes

1/10/2022,"France will press the EU to negotiate an asylum and migration treaty with the UK in an attempt to deter people from making the dangerous Channel crossing. The French government, which last week took up the six-month rotating presidency of the EU council of ministers, wants the whole bloc to act, despite warnings that other member states have no appetite for a migration treaty with Britain.  A senior French government official said the purpose of an EU-UK treaty would be to open up “a legal means of immigration with Great Britain, so people can legally go to Great Britain to seek asylum”. The source added that “obviously that means reciprocity,” suggesting British authorities could send people denied asylum back to the European country in which they had arrived. “We would be prepared to consider this. The idea is to have a zero balance at the end of the day.” Yet it remains unclear if the UK would agree to such proposals. During Brexit negotiations, the government was refused an asylum pact that would have allowed UK authorities to return people denied asylum to the EU, an arrangement that existed under Britain’s EU membership. The government, however, has long opposed allowing people to apply for asylum outside the UK, fearing it will trigger bogus claims. The EU commissioner for home affairs, Ylva Johansson, told the Guardian last month that other member states had limited appetite for an asylum and migration treaty with the UK, citing the Brexit dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol. The French government source countered that it was “a very important European question, not just a French question,” noting that France, Belgium and the Netherlands were “struggling with a major problem” as thousands of people came to their countries seeking to reach the UK. France and Britain had a spectacular diplomatic fallout last year, after 27 people drowned in the Channel trying to reach the UK. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, accused Boris Johnson of not being serious, after the UK prime minister published proposals on Twitter in time for newspaper deadlines, before the Élysée had received them. The French government argues the UK has lax labour market laws that act as a magnet for irregular migrants. Clément Beaune, France’s Europe minister, has accused the UK of “an economic model, of sometimes, quasi-modern slavery”. For its part, the British government blames the EU’s border-free travel zone: the home secretary, Priti Patel, said last year that “the real problem on illegal migration flows is the EU has no border protections whatsoever”. France received more than three times as many applications for asylum as the UK in 2020, with 93,470 claims, second in the EU only to Germany, which received 121,955 applications. In the same year 29,456 people applied for asylum in the UK The mooted treaty with the UK is part of a broader French agenda of tighter oversight of the free movement of people. Macron, who is expected to seek re-election this spring, wants to reform the EU’s passport-free Schengen zone and make progress on a long-stalled asylum law governing how to distribute refugees around the bloc. France would like greater political oversight of the 26-country Schengen zone, with regular meetings of home affairs ministers, akin to the monthly gatherings of the 19 finance ministers of the eurozone. “Our plan is to put more politics into the governance of Schengen,” said the government source, who said the agreement had been drawn up in a different era.

While imposing rigorous systems, Guardiola is also flexible when required, adapting to the needs of the various teams he has managed. Johnson: Somewhat different. While as London mayor Johnson successfully delegated much decision-making to trusted aides, his Downing Street has been marked by disorganisation, high staff turnover and brutal infighting. Guardiola: Manchester City are 10 points ahead in the Premier League and seem in a strong position to bring Guardiola a fourth title with the club. He is still hugely popular with their fans, even if he has yet to deliver a Champions League win, losing last year’s final to Chelsea. Johnson: Feted by his party after the 2019 election win, but faces increasing unrest from Tory MPs over tax rises, Covid restrictions, the cost of living and reports about allegedly lockdown-breaking Downing Street parties. Might not survive another season. Guardiola: Married entrepreneur Cristina Serra in 2014, after the pair had already been a couple for around 20 years. They have a son and two daughters. Johnson: Married three times, most recently to former Conservative party PR head Carrie Symonds, with whom he has two young children. Has four grown-up children from his second marriage, to barrister Marina Wheeler, and at least one other child, possibly more.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson v Pep Guardiola: who is the true blue champion?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/boris-johnson-v-pep-guardiola-who-is-the-true-blue-champion
1/10/2022,"The Ohio Republican Jim Jordan is the second sitting congressman to refuse a request for cooperation from the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.  In a Sunday night letter to the committee chair, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the Trump ally accused the panel of “an outrageous abuse” of its authority. He also claimed “an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague’s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives”. “This request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry,” he said, “violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms.” Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, who was also closely involved in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn his election defeat, has also refused to cooperate. The former Trump strategist Steve Bannon has pleaded not guilty to a charge of criminal contempt of Congress, for refusing cooperation. His trial is set for July. Mark Meadows, Trump’s final White House chief of staff and a former congressman, has also refused. The committee has recommended a criminal charge. Citing committee sources, the Guardian has reported that the panel is considering whether Trump himself might be charged with criminal conspiracy. But Thompson has suggested the panel may have few options to compel testimony from sitting members of Congress. An alternative path may be a series of primetime public hearings, seeking as wide an audience as possible. In columns for the Guardian, the former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal has laid out Jordan’s extensive contacts with Trump before and on 6 January, throughout legalistic efforts to throw out results and the Capitol riot itself. Blumenthal has also suggested precedent exists for compelling Jordan to testify – in the investigation of John Brown’s anti-slavery raid on Harper’s Ferry, Virginia in 1859. That event preceded the civil war, fought from 1861 to 1865. Many academics and observers have warned that Trump’s assault on democracy could stoke such conflict. Five people died and more than 140 police officers were injured around the attack on Congress, which failed to stop the certification of electoral college results. Trump was impeached, for inciting an insurrection, and acquitted. Jordan, a former wrestling coach and member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, is a leading Trump ally in Congress. Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, proposed Jordan as a member of the 6 January committee. Democrats blocked it. Only two Republicans sit on the panel: Trump critics Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. On Sunday, Kinzinger asked on NBC: “What did the president know about 6 January leading up to 6 January? “It’s the difference between, was the president absolutely incompetent or a coward on 6 January when he didn’t do anything or did he know what was coming? That’s a difference between incompetence with your oath and possibly criminal.” On Sunday night, a spokesperson said the committee would respond to Jordan soon and “consider appropriate next steps”. “Mr Jordan has admitted that he spoke directly to President Trump on 6 January and is thus a material witness,” the spokesperson said. “Mr Jordan’s letter to the committee fails to address these facts.”",News/US news,Congressman Jim Jordan refuses to cooperate with 6 January committee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/us-capitol-attack-jim-jordan-refuses-cooperate
1/10/2022,"After landing in Melbourne on 6 January, Novak Djokovic is questioned by Sudhir R, an officer of the Department of Home Affairs, about why he has travelled to the country. After clarifying that he has come to play in the Australian Open, the officer asks him about his vaccination status. The quotes are taken from the transcript agreed between both parties and released by the Federal Circuit Court in Melbourne on Monday. INTERVIEWER: Are you vaccinated?DJOKOVIC: I am not vaccinated.INTERVIEWER: Thank you. Have you ever had Covid?DJOKOVIC: Yes. I had Covid twice … in June 2020 and recently – I was tested positive, PCR 16th of December 2021 … I have the documents as well to confirm that. If you want I can provide.  The interview is then suspended while Djokovic’s documents are photocopied. When it resumes at 00.35am, the world No1 confirms that his manager filled in his visa application and claims that he has a medical exemption to enter Australia from the federal government. INTERVIEWER: OK, so this letter here, medical exemption pretty much talks about a review panel by Tennis Australia, it doesn’t talk about the federal government? But you are sure definitely … DJOKOVIC: Yes, the process was, yes, the process there was two indepen … two medical panels … there was one that was related to the federal government for sure. The interview is then suspended for a second time before recommencing. It turns out that Djokovic has got confused - and exemption certificate he has is from the state government instead. DJOKOVIC: Yes, so I just checked with my agent … this certificate for exemption has been provided by independent expert medical review panel commissioned by Tennis Australia and the decision of the panel has been reviewed and endorsed by independent medical exemption review panel of the Victorian state government. INTERVIEWER: So previously you said to me that it was done by the government. DJOKOVIC: Yes, I, I, well I probably made a mistake, it was not the federal government, it was the Victorian government that had selected the independent medical panel that has reviewed together with the Australian Open. INTERVIEWER: That’s absolutely fine, but the thing is like you [inaudible] come to Australia and it is pretty much governed by Federal government. DJOKOVIC: This I understand. So do you need any additional documents from me?INTERVIEWER: Yeah, if you are claiming that you did receive emails from federal government … because, yeah, we want to give you every opportunity to provide as much information as you can. DJOKOVIC: All right. OK, so no we did not get any emails from the federal government. This is what we got from the Australian Open player medical team, because they are the organisers of the event, so this is what we got. INTERVIEWER: OK, that’s fine. DJOKOVIC: And I am sorry, I apologise. The interview is then suspended at 00:52am, and Djokovic has to wait another three hours before it resumes at 3:55am. Immediately he is issued with a notice of intention to consider cancellation of his visa. INTERVIEWER: So I’m just going to read out all the information. DJOKOVIC: I don’t understand, you’re cancelling my visa, or?INTERVIEWER: This is a notice of intention to consider cancellation under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958. So once I serve this notice to you I will give you like, you know, 20 minutes – or whatever if you need more time you can request that – and you need to provide us reasons why we shouldn’t cancel the visa. DJOKOVIC: I mean, I am really failing to understand what else do you want me to provide to you. I have provided all the documents that Tennis Australia and Victorian government has asked me to do in the last three/four weeks, this is what we have been doing. My agent and I have been in a constant communication with Tennis Australia and Victorian state government, the medical panel… INTERVIEWER: Yep. DJOKOVIC: They have allowed to have the medical exemption for the Covid vaccination. I applied, they approved, I just really don’t know what else do you want me to say … I just really don’t understand what is the reason you don’t allow me to enter your country – just I mean, I have been waiting four hours and I still fail to, to understand what’s the main reason – like – lack of what papers? Lack of what information do you need? Or?INTERVIEWER: Ah yep, so I am just going to read out all of the information to you and I’m going to give you a copy of this as well …DJOKOVIC: So you’re giving me legally 20 minutes to try to provide additional information that I don’t have? At 4 o clock in the morning? I mean you kind of put me in a very awkward position where at 4 in the morning I can’t call director of Tennis Australia, I can’t engage with anybody from the Victorian state government through Tennis Australia. I just you put me in a very uncomfortable position. I don’t know what else can I tell you. I mean everything that that they – I was asked to do is here. INTERVIEWER: Yeah. DJOKOVIC: And I wouldn’t be here sitting in front of you if I if I wasn’t complying to all the rules and regulations set by your government. So I just – I don’t know what I I mean – to me it is a little bit shocking that you are have – that you are going to give me the notice to cancel my visa based on what? If you can, we wait for 8 in the morning and then I can call Tennis Australia and then we can try and figure this out. But right now? They’re all sleepy… I don’t know what else I can do at this moment. So I really, I know legally you’re following – but it just doesn’t make any sense. I mean I have done everything I possibly can. Right now I can call my agent. You – you told me not to use my phone, so I’m not communicating with anybody, no one knows what’s going on.INTERVIEWER: Mmhm. DJOKOVIC: But I really need to understand from you because you’ve been giving me very vague answers, or literally no answers at all, for the last four hours… the intention to consider to cancel, which I don’t really understand what it means. The interviewer explains that under the Biosecurity Act 2015, there are requirements for entry into Australian territory - and that previous infection with COVID-19 is not considered a medical contraindication for COVID-19 vaccination in Australia.DJOKOVIC: Sorry to interrupt but that’s not true. The independent medical panel of Victorian state government has stated explicitly that that that if you have recovered or if you had the positive test of coronavirus and negative test of coronavirus in the last six months and you have a sufficient amount of antibodies, you’re you’re considered to be part of the the the process of getting a medical exemption. That’s how I got it. I mean I communicated directly with the Victorian state government, that’s absolutely not true. The interviewer then reads out a long statement to Djokovic, telling him that unvaccinated persons create a greater health risk of contracting Covid-19 and spreading Covid-19 to others, either of which will further burden the Australian health system. He adds that if his Visa is cancelled he maybe prevented from entering Australia for three years. He then asks Djokovic to sign a document. DJOKOVIC: So I don’t know really what to do at 4am. If you allow me to switch on my phone and make a call to my agent and try and get a hold of people from Tennis Australia.There’s absolutely no way I would put myself in a position to come and sit here with you and it would definitely come to my attention, the attention of my agent or the team of people around me that the six months Covid regulation was not in place. INTERVIEWER: That’s fine, but I need to go through this process, and so, that’s fine if you don’t want to sign it, but I will still, I will make a photocopy of it, I will give it to you, so I’m just going to say you’re not going to sign. DJOKOVIC: OK so can you just explain to me whether you will allow me to acquire more information from through my phone with my agent? INTERVIEWER: So not at this stage, once I finish off this or suspend this interview I will come back and I will let you know. The interview is then suspended for a fourth time at 4.23am before recommencing nine minutes later. Djokovic is told he can now use his phone. The interview is again suspended before resuming at 5.20am, when Djokovic is told that he will be moved to a hotel in the city. DJOKOVIC: But that hotel? Is it like a Covid hotel or is it what is it?INTERVIEWER: No, it’s, I don’t know the name of it, it’s just a place … I’m guessing the department has contracted with the hotel to allow people in … who’s refused entry to the country to stay at the hotel there. DJOKOVIC: OK. So does that mean I can take my bags with me or?INTERVIEWER: First thing is, I just wanted to see… what’s your response to the NOIC, notice of intention to cancel to consider cancellation, so do you have anything to say, why the visa shouldn’t, why shouldn’t we consider cancelling the visa? Djokovic again states his reasons why he should be allowed his visa. The interview is then suspended for a sixth time at 6.14am before resuming at 7.38am. Djokovic is then notified that the Australian government intends to cancel his visa under section 116 of the Migration Act 1958. INTERVIEWER: Other relevant agencies will be advised that your visa has been cancelled. Um, so this is the notification and the time is 7:42 am. Um, up to you, your choice if you wish to sign. DJOKOVIC: No. INTERVIEWER: That’s fine. I’m just gonna invite another officer into the room and she’s gonna detain you. DETAINING OFFICER: My name is Beck, I’m an officer of the Australian Border Force. It has come to my attention that you are an unlawful non-citizen in Australia. 20 Therefore, I am detaining you under section 189(1) of the Migration Act of 1958 at 07:43 hours on the sixth of January 2022. Now I’ll leave you with my colleague. DJOKOVIC: Ah, just regarding the next step am I going to be escorted to a hotel?INTERVIEWER: Yeah so, the next step is gonna be you would be escorted to a hotel. That’s where you will stay, and then inform the airline, and once we get some more information. SERCO - it’s another agency who takes care of it - they’ll inform you and then they’ll bring you back to the airport. DJOKOVIC: OK. Which airline are you – because I, do I have any, decision in where I’m gonna go or – travel? Because I can buy my own ticket to go back. INTERVIEWER: Yeah – that – that’s right. Pretty much the way it works whichever airline you flew with, we’ll inform them and it’s their responsibility. So you came with… DJOKOVIC: Emirates, yeah, so will go back to Dubai. NTERVIEWER: Yep. So if you don’t have any more questions, yeah, I’ll just cease this interview. DJOKOVIC: OK. INTERVIEWER: All right, so the interview is being ceased at 7:45 am on 6 January 2022.

1/10/2022,"Given their decades-long ubiquity, it’s weird to realise that Ant and Dec don’t actually make a lot of television shows. Just three really, at the moment: Saturday Night Takeaway, I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! and Britain’s Got Talent. In TV years, all three are positively ancient, with the first two starting in 2002 and the third in 2007. With hits as perennial as these, it’s little wonder that Ant and Dec don’t choose to branch out more, especially when their efforts to host new shows tend to flounder and die in the space of a year or two. Anyone remember PokerFace? Push the Button? Red or Black? In all honesty, probably not.  Which brings us to Limitless Win. On the face of it, this is a shiny-floored Saturday night gameshow like any other. There are questions. There’s a Who Wants To Be a Millionaire-style money ladder. There are absurdly chipper contestants. On the face of it, Limitless Win is utterly anonymous. It could be presented by Bradley Walsh or Nick Knowles or Davina McCall or the ghost of Bob Monkhouse or a photofit of a horse. So why have Ant and Dec chosen this to be their first new series proper in a decade? Probably the format. Limitless Win is, with the exception of a few bells and whistles that we’ll come to in a moment, Who Wants To Be a Millionaire. The more questions you answer, the more money you win. But, as the title suggests, there is no upper limit. On Millionaire, you answer 15 questions and go home a – well, millionaire. But here, you can just keep going until you lose. That might be when you reach a thousand pounds. It might be at a million pounds. The onscreen money ladder goes all the way up to £12m, but it doesn’t stop there. In theory, a genius could take part on Limitless Win, and be its only ever contestant, and slowly drain the entire planet of all its financial reserves. That is unlikely to happen, of course – largely because Limitless Win suffers from the annoying gameshow trope of slowing everything to an agonising crawl wherever possible. We meet the contestants. We see them backstage. We get to watch them debate every single possible answer to every single question, at length, in real time. Maybe I’m the only one who finds this sort of thing infuriating. Maybe the general public is crazy for watching couples passive-aggressively bickering about the number of sails on the Blue Peter ship like the world’s worst dinner party guests. Who can really say? On the subject of annoyances, Limitless Win also seems to be the recipient of several gratuitous complications. For instance, the answer to every question is a number. You lose lives depending on how much your answer varies from the correct answer. You gain lives in a quickfire 60-second round. You pick the number by twisting a dial. There are also lifelines, which come at random and are so numerous that each has to be explained at length every time. If you want to use a lifeline, you have to hit a button. There is another button for when you want to cash out. It is all so unnecessarily complicated that, when your auntie inevitably pulls the home game edition out of the cupboard three Boxing Days from now, she’ll get three lines into the instructions before your entire family loses their minds with rage. And yet, despite all this, Limitless Win resides in the upper echelons of gameshows. The reason for this, of course, is Ant and Dec. As hosts, they are absolutely effortless. They can explain the rules without battering you over the head. They can chat to the contestants like old friends. When the prize amount starts to gain altitude, they ramp up the tension like a pair of pantomime dames, clutching their temples and pulling faces at the crowd. The thing is, they sell all this like a dream. Another host might be tempted to overdo it, plunging the show into the realms of insincere melodrama. Not Ant and Dec: theirs is a perfectly weighted performance. It doesn’t show off their skill set perfectly – that’s still I’m a Celebrity – but it’s beautiful to watch nonetheless. Are they enough to keep me watching Limitless Win? In all honesty, probably not. Once you’ve seen one episode, the only reason to stick around is to see how much money the contestants will win, and you sense that the press will make a lot of noise about the big episodes ahead of time. Still, this is Ant and Dec’s most effective new venture in probably two decades and, as such, you shouldn’t be surprised if it becomes an ITV mainstay.",Arts/Television & radio,Limitless Win: will Ant and Dec’s gameshow drain the entire planet’s finances?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/10/limitless-win-will-ant-and-decs-gameshow-drain-the-entire-planets-finances
1/10/2022,"Lalage Bown, who has died aged 94, was appointed to her first teaching post in the new University of the Gold Coast (Ghana) in 1949. Although only 22, she immediately questioned the department’s British literature-oriented curriculum, believing that poems such as Wordsworth’s Daffodils (I wandered lonely as a cloud) had little meaning for African students, and that it was important for them to encounter writing by and about African people. Challenged by the department’s senior members, who doubted that such texts existed, she bet them a bottle of beer that she could produce numerous passages written in English by African authors over the previous 200 years. Within two weeks she won her beer, and mimeographed copies of the relevant works were distributed to students and teachers.  Eventually Bown edited the resulting anthology, Two Centuries of African English, including prose by the 18th-century writers Ignatius Sancho and Olaudah Equiano, as well as more contemporary politicians and authors such as Jomo Kenyatta, Julius Nyerere and Chinua Achebe. The anthology was published in the Heinemann African Writers Series in 1973, rapidly becoming a core text for adult education and other classes throughout Africa. This was just one of numerous books she edited and co-edited. Throughout her three-decade career in Africa, Bown established a network of adult education institutions and organisations in Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. Her energy and formidable abilities as a manager, linked to a talent for encouraging collaboration, brought lasting achievements for adult literacy in these countries. Together with her African colleagues in Zambia, for example, she established a national extramural programme that emphasised current issues, introduced special courses for trade unionists, politicians and police, and drew on radio and television as a media for education. She also set up the first systematic training for adult educators in Africa, and was the founding secretary of the African Adult Education Association. When she returned to Britain permanently in 1980, she devoted her considerable energies to widening access to adult education throughout the UK. Bown gave particular attention to helping women in Africa learn to read and write. In a 2009 interview for the Unesco education sector newsletter, she commented: “I was left with the huge conviction that even the simplest acquisition of literacy can have a profoundly empowering effect personally, socially and politically. When it comes to women, there is a huge change in their self-worth and confidence.” In 1990 she drew on experience in Africa, the US and Britain, and as an active member of the Canadian-based International Council for Adult Education, to produce a widely cited report for ActionAid, Preparing the Future: Women, Literacy and Development. Born in Croydon, Surrey (now in the London borough of Croydon), the daughter of Dorothy (nee Watson) and Arthur Bown, Lalage was the eldest of four children. Her unusual name, pronounced Lallagy, derives from an ode by the Roman poet Horace. Her father worked for the Indian civil service in Burma (now Myanmar), but the children stayed in children’s holiday homes and boarding schools in Britain, visited by their mother during the summer holidays, and their father only when he was on leave once every three years. Lalage was educated in Wycombe Abbey school and Cheltenham Ladies’ college, before studying modern history at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating in 1949. She subsequently took an MA in adult education and economic development. After six years as resident tutor at the University of the Gold Coast, Bown taught in the extramural department at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. In 1960, she marked Nigeria’s independence while serving as assistant director of extramural studies at the University of Ibadan. Following four years as director of extramural studies at the University of Zambia, and the end of the Nigerian civil war, she was appointed professor of adult education in Ahmadu Bello University, northern Nigeria. In 1977 Bown moved to the University of Lagos, where in 1979 she was appointed dean of education. While in Nigeria, she took into her home five-year-old twin girls, Taiwo and Kehinde, whose family had been victims of the war, and she became their permanent foster mother. Bown’s achievements in the field of adult studies did not go unnoticed outside Africa. She was appointed OBE in 1977. In 1975 she received an honorary doctorate from the Open University for services to the education of the underprivileged, and was the first woman to receive the William Pearson Tolley medal from Syracuse University, New York, for outstanding contributions to lifelong and continuing education. In 1981 she was appointed director and titular professor to the University of Glasgow’s department of adult and continuing education. Under her leadership, that department offered the widest range of subjects of all continuing education departments in the UK. After her retirement in 1992, Bown remained an active member not only of her local Rotary Club in Shrewsbury but also of numerous international societies and boards, including the Council for Education in the Commonwealth from 1999 till 2006. She was made a fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland and also of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1991, and was inducted into the International Adult and Continuing Education Hall of Fame in 2009. She is survived by a brother, Hugh, and by Taiwo and Kehinde.
