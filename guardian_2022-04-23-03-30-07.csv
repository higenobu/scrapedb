4/23/2022,"A man fell to his death from a burning block of flats after police arrived to look for a suspected arsonist. Five officers tried to get inside the property to rescue the man, in his 50s, but were overcome by the flames, police said. One officer sustained serious burns and remained in hospital on Friday. The others were treated for “minor injuries and smoke inhalation” and discharged, while a firefighter was treated by paramedics at the scene, Bedfordshire police said. Detectives had been investigating three attempted arson attacks on properties in Luton in the early hours of Wednesday and used CCTV footage to identify a suspect.The officers were dispatched to the apartment in Green Court, in a 15-storey block, at around 4am on Thursday but arrived to find the entrance on fire. Emergency services were called but police said the “fire took further hold of the flat” before the man fell from a window. Assistant chief constable Sharn Basra said: “This is a tragic case and we are working hard to establish all of the facts of what took place. “Our focus on Thursday was on identifying the man who had died and tracing his family members before we released any further information publicly. “We have also been carefully recovering all possible evidence from the scene and assisting residents who had been displaced from their homes. What is clear from the evidence collected so far is the bravery of the attending officer, who tried to fight through the flames to save the man inside. “Our thoughts remain with both him as he recovers in hospital and the loved ones of the man who sadly died.” The man has yet to be formally identified and his next of kin have been informed, the force added. The case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. More than 100 residents were evacuated from the building on Thursday morning, with the majority allowed back into their flats by the evening. Luton council said there is no indication that cladding was a factor in the fire. The Bedfordshire fire and rescue service area commander, Stuart Auger, said: “The fire was successfully contained to the flat thanks to the efficient performance of the building’s fire protection measures and fire doors. “Thanks to this we were able to work alongside Bedfordshire police to efficiently evacuate all residents from the building with the help of smoke hoods. “Our thoughts are with the loved ones of the person who sadly passed away and we will work with partners to reassure the community over the coming weeks and months.” Anyone with information which may assist the police investigation is asked to call 101 or get in touch with the force through beds.police.uk/ro/report, quoting Operation Cheagle.",News/UK news,Man falls from burning block of flats in Luton,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/man-falls-from-burning-block-of-flats-in-luton

4/23/2022,"Education officials in Florida have been criticized for putting “political theater” over teaching after they revealed four examples from among the 54 math textbooks they rejected last week. The state said it had refused to use the books because of “prohibited topics” including alleged references to critical race theory. On Friday, however, after pressure to explain the decisions, the education department published several images of math problems from the textbook with the offending segments highlighted. In one example, a colored graph features levels of “racial prejudice” by age. Another example, under the heading “adding and subjecting polynomials”, begins with the words: “What? Me? Racist?” and uses the statistical results of a common survey about unconscious bias as an example for a set of mathematics problems. The other examples make references to “social and emotional learning” or “social awareness”, concepts that conservative education activists say are a gateway to leftwing ideology. “Those examples were given with no context and were not even elementary-level material,” Andrew Spar, president of the Florida Education Association that represents more than 150,000 educators, said. “So it seems like it’s more about smoke and mirrors of trying to accomplish a political agenda than really about what we are teaching our kids.” Florida’s banning of the books is widely seen by critics as an extension of Republican governor Ron DeSantis’s “culture war” on the supposed indoctrination of children in schools. He recently signed the state’s controversial “don’t say gay” law – officially the Parental Rights in Education bill – that prohibits discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in elementary classrooms. His education department came under fire last week for announcing it had banned the textbooks without giving supporting details, and it said it was releasing the images “based on the volume of requests the department has received for examples of problematic elements of the recently reviewed instructional materials”. The department said the examples were not an exhaustive list, and provided the images with no descriptions or context. “Social and emotional learning” has been attacked by conservatives. Quoted in the New York Times, Chris Rufo, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, linked social-emotional learning to a wider discussion of race, gender and sexuality teaching in classrooms, and called it “a delivery mechanism for radical pedagogies such as critical race theory and gender deconstructionism”. Other content that Florida’s education leaders objected to are cartoon children appearing at the side of textbook pages encouraging students to “learn together”, to have “a growth mindset” by trying a new way to tackle a problem when they were stuck, or to adopt a “math mindset” to help understand their feelings. “Math is about getting the right answer. It’s not about how you feel about the problem,” DeSantis said at a press conference earlier in the week. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “The [Florida education] department is continuing to give publishers the opportunity to remediate all deficiencies identified during the review to ensure the broadest selection of high quality instructional materials are available to the school districts and Florida’s students.” Teachers representatives, meanwhile, dismissed it as “political theater” by the governor, who is, they say, focused on the wrong priorities. “What educators and parents are concerned about is if we don’t have teachers in our classrooms, or bus drivers to get kids to school on time, then our kids aren’t learning math or any other subject,” Spar said. “We’re expecting over 9,000 teacher vacancies by the end of the year, according to the state board that he appoints, and we have a massive bus driver, paraprofessional, cafeteria worker, custodian shortage in addition. We’ve heard the governor say or do nothing about it. “These kinds of antics and political theater going on over these textbooks is exactly what’s driving people out of the profession.”",News/US news,Florida’s examples of banned topics in math books derided as ‘political theater’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/florida-examples-prohibited-topics-math-textbooks
4/23/2022,"By attending the inauguration of a new JCB factory in Gujarat on Thursday, Boris Johnson might have thought he was leaving his troubles behind in Westminster. What harm was there in going in to bat for a successful British business owned by a big Tory donor? Plenty, it transpires. Mr Johnson walked into a major human rights controversy over the use of JCB’s bulldozers in flattening Muslim homes and businesses in Delhi and in states run by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party. Mr Johnson should not have mugged for the cameras with the machinery used to intimidate religious minorities by a regime seemingly bent on creating a theocratic Hindu state. Perhaps he is unaware of the growing sense of vulnerability felt by India’s 200 million Muslims. But no one who is paying attention could miss what Mr Modi is about. He is the only person ever denied a US visa for “severe violations of religious freedom”. This was in 2005, after he failed, as Gujarat’s chief minister, to stop a series of deadly anti-Muslim riots. Earlier this month the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Washington was monitoring a rise in human rights abuses in India by “some government, police and prison officials”. The US often takes an instrumental approach in determining whether human rights violations are raised or overlooked. India’s democratic backsliding, coupled with Delhi’s refusal to speak out against the Russian invasion of Ukraine, probably tilted the scales in the White House. But Mr Blinken’s warning should have been heeded by Mr Johnson. Instead of keeping his distance, Mr Johnson hugged Mr Modi close. India is set to be the world’s fastest-growing major economy over the next two years. London joins the list of capitals courting Mr Modi, despite his refusal to choose sides over Moscow’s invasion. India’s bargaining power rests on appearing as a key element in western-led efforts to counterbalance China in the Indo-Pacific. One assumption is that India is so indispensable in geopolitics that its partners will not be offended if it also deals with some of their opponents. Another is that the country is competently governed and has the social and economic means to accomplish its policy goals. The latter is a live question. Mr Modi failed to grasp the scale of the Covid pandemic early on, and his mistakes meant that Delhi failed to fulfil its obligation to supply Covid vaccines to the EU. Last year, Germany’s then leader Angela Merkel wondered if Europe had erred in allowing India to become a large pharmaceutical producer. Britain’s prime minister pointedly described India as the world’s pharmacy. Mr Johnson, who faces political oblivion thanks to his own pandemic mistakes, might envy the ends – if not the means – of Mr Modi’s rule. The Indian prime minister has been in power since 2014. His success is built on an aggressive assault against minorities, with economic policies that favour the rich. Mr Modi’s populist repertoire sees him claiming that the poor are his priority, while doing little to combat inequalities. His appeal endures despite rising unemployment and Covid deaths. Judges rarely confront the government. Civil society opponents are jailed. But Britain is not India. The Indian jurist BR Ambedkar sensed a fatal political flaw in his fellow citizens: the tendency towards hero worship, which he said was “a sure road to degradation and to eventual dictatorship”. In Mr Modi, that prophecy might be fulfilled.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson in India: flying into trouble | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-in-india-flying-into-trouble
4/23/2022,"Voters in Britain are familiar with the concept of the “red wall” – a group of regional constituencies in the UK that traditionally voted Labour, but flipped to supporting Boris Johnson. For Australians unfamiliar with the lore, it’s a simple story. Johnson won the 2019 election by forging a new coalition of traditional Tories and pro-Brexit working-class voters antipathetic to the then Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Much was written at the time about this electoral realignment; swathes of people had moved away from voting according to their economic interests, and were now more motivated by identity and cultural affinity – a shift that also underwrote Trumpism. The red wall concept has surfaced in dispatches in Australia during the opening two weeks of the 2022 election campaign. There’s been sustained speculation among journalists and some pundits about whether Scott Morrison is currently attempting a Johnson-like flip, writing off heartland seats in metropolitan Australia at risk from the so-called “teal” independents and hunting for gains in outer suburban and regional Labor-held seats, like Hunter and Parramatta, to offset the losses. There’s a few things to say about this. Now you’ve heard the red wall story, it will feel very familiar. This recruitment exercise is not new in Australia – for the Liberals, this has been a 30-year project. John Howard used various culture wars to chip off a chunk of Labor’s traditional base. Tony Abbott weaponised carbon pricing to that end, and the scars of that corrosively cynical foray persist until this day. Morrison has pursued the same core objective, narrowcasting relentlessly to men who might vote Labor. In 2019, one of the pillars of Morrison’s recruitment strategy was the entirely bogus “war on the weekend”. In 2022, the speculation about Morrison and red wall strategies has surfaced in the context of a transgender rights debate that has erupted during the campaign. The current debate has been catalysed by two things – the first is the deeply offensive and insensitive views of the Liberal candidate in Warringah, Katherine Deves, and the second is Morrison’s decision to publicly back a private member’s bill from the conservative Liberal senator Claire Chandler banning transgender women from playing women’s sport. Trans rights is an established part of the culture war repertoire in Britain and the US, but the same toxic debates haven’t yet taken off here. If you follow politics closely, you’ll know the prime minister was limbering up pre-election to entrench his religious discrimination legislation as the cultural wedge of the 2022 contest – but his own people shot his torpedo out of the sky when they crossed the floor and effectively killed that bill. So we’ve had, are having, this trans debate – which is grotesque really, given the vulnerabilities of the community, particularly young people. During the past fortnight, Morrison has used this issue to foreground his own conservative values; court fractious elements of his own base contemplating voting for Clive Palmer or Pauline Hanson because of vaccination mandates and lockdowns; and also to recruit Labor defectors alienated by what they would consider the excessive relativist progressivism of contemporary culture. There are different views around the government about whether Morrison’s persistent signalling is a cunning plan or a found strategy (and by found strategy, I mean a snookered prime minister is making a virtue of necessity). I’ll need to unpack this a bit I suspect. The cunning plan scenario is Morrison and his brains trust sees the sustained contention as a net positive for him and the campaign – the latest successful instalment in a three-decade centre-right Australian project to hollow Labor’s base and fully entrench the Coalition federally as the natural party of government. There are costs – to be sure. It’s possible the government loses Wentworth or North Sydney as progressive Liberal voters make it clear they’ve had enough of Morrison and his plots and his brinkmanship. But small losses don’t matter if you can shore up the base, stem a leakage of votes to populist rightwing insurgents and pick up new voters who identify with your message. The found strategy scenario is Morrison is in irretrievable trouble. The “teal” seats are already gone, and marginals are also at risk. If you are the party leader in this scenario, all you can do is try to blast your way back into the contest, and if you can’t, then sandbag as many seats as you can. Sometimes you break back, or sandbag, by giving voters something new to chew on. But there are risks of course. The main risk is voters will become seriously irritated by the fixation on an issue they regard either as completely confected, abstract or immaterial. It is unclear to me whether the current conversation shifts votes when people are concerned about housing prices, inflation and jobs. Brexit, and the identity politics that hung off that, was potent. “Axe the tax” was total bollocks, but potent. But is this issue? Just as there are two ways to look at Morrison’s tactical motives, one offensive and the other defensive, there are also two ways to look at his decision to dig in behind Deves – a candidate who on any measure of decency should be gone. The first probability is Morrison chose Deves deliberately to ignite a culture war about trans rights that would smoulder away in the background in an election predominantly about economic management. Deves would speak to cohorts of persuadable voters, but at a micro level. But in the way of campaigns, where controlled burns can escalate into bushfires, the Morrison/Deves bespoke culture war has now become a macro issue. It now imperils the government’s chances of hanging on on 21 May because the whole wretched foray reinforces Morrison’s negatives among progressive Liberal supporters – his refusal to adopt a serious climate policy, his implacable obduracy on a federal integrity commission, and his complete botch up of last year’s #MeToo reckoning. But the problem is Morrison is now trapped. He might want to dump Deves to minimise the risk of a teal wash. But that’s now fraught, because if Morrison cancels the Warringah candidate, he not only loses face, he will galvanise groups like Family Voice or the Australian Christian Lobby or other well-organised conservative religious forces – as well as generating pearl clutching histrionics in the Murdochsphere. If Morrison dumps Deves, cue unhinging among the Fox News mini-mes who proselytise to the Liberal party faithful. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Speaking of crowns, Labor will do everything in its power to dislodge Morrison’s between now and 21 May, and particularly over the next seven days while Anthony Albanese is in isolation recovering from Covid-19. Last weekend, insiders were reporting pressure was mounting on Labor’s campaign director, Paul Erickson, and the advertising team to go negative against Morrison. Why negative so early? Labor’s marginal seat holders, out canvassing and phone banking around the clock, were reporting swinging voters were more persuaded by negative messages about Morrison and his record than by their own positive policy pitch. This was particularly true in Queensland, where Labor has an enormous (perhaps impossible) job to do to bring Morrison’s numbers down. The view there is if Labor can turn this election contest into a referendum about Morrison, then victory is possible. Labor’s first negative advertisements about Morrison screened this week, before Covid forced Albanese off the hustings. The Labor campaign will deploy the front bench over the next seven days to fill the void. While it is very unhelpful for Albanese to lose momentum just as he had found his confidence on the hustings – particularly given a lot of voters are still on the fence because they haven’t seen enough of him – some in the Labor brains trust see (or perhaps hope) there is upside. Frontbenchers can go harder against Morrison than Albanese could on the hustings because putative prime ministers generally don’t get to be prime ministers by presenting as street brawlers. And if you want the campaign to be a referendum on Morrison – perhaps your best chance is to make him a solo act.",News/Australia news,The ‘red wall’ and what it means for Australia’s election campaign | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/23/the-red-wall-and-what-it-means-for-australias-election-campaign
4/23/2022,"Barely a month after two separate reviews of policing made the case for radical reform in light of growing risks, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has issued a fresh blast of criticism. The latest findings relate to the police’s approach to stop and search. The number of these searches carried out rose 24% to 695,009 in the year to March 2021. Almost 70% of stops – 478,576 – were drugs searches. While the Met points to the seizure of 4,800 weapons as proof that stop and search is a valid tool, the IOPC rightly asserts that the service – which uses stop and search more than any other – must, along with the UK’s other 42 forces, “balance tackling crime with building trust”. This has fallen to alarmingly low levels after a series of incidents that have horrified even many of those who are usually pro-police. The most extreme was the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving officer. More recently, reports of the strip-search of a 15-year-old girl, carried out at school with no teachers or parent present, provoked outrage. An official investigation found that racism was “likely to have been an influencing factor” in the way this black child was treated. Last week it was announced that the school’s headteacher has stepped down. Racism is to the fore too in the stop and search review. In the year to March 2021, black people were seven times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched. Extraordinarily, the official police watchdog is now calling for people from black, Asian and other ethnic minority backgrounds to be “safeguarded” from the harms caused by biased policing. The Home Office and police chiefs should take up the suggestion of research into the trauma this causes, including to children and young people, and bearing in mind the disproportionate use of force including handcuffs. Allegations that one boy was searched 60 times over two years, starting when he was 14, are being examined. Racism in the police, of course, is nothing new. Nor is sexism. Arguably, the sharing of grossly offensive images and views on social media – for example by disgraced officers at Charing Cross station, in Hampshire and West Mercia – has simply given an uglier edge to pre-existing attitudes and behaviour. But what has become clearer recently is that flawed leadership has allowed the situation to deteriorate. The acting Met chief, Sir Stephen House, told MPs last week that his former boss Dame Cressida Dick had been wrong to blame the force’s problems on rogue individuals. Instead, it is “subcultures” that need to be rooted out – failures of supervision that must be faced. But while it is a relief to see this admitted – and it must always be remembered that police officers, like other frontline public sector workers, do a difficult job – it is impossible to have faith in any promised clearout. The outgoing chief inspector, Sir Tom Winsor, believes the problems are structural as well as cultural. The architecture of the 43 separate forces is “far from fit for purpose”, his final report said. He also raised the threat of infiltration by organised crime. Change is needed and the current home secretary, Priti Patel, is incapable of leading it. The opportunity is there for the government’s opponents to set out an alternative. Labour should take it. British policing needs an overhaul.",News/UK news,The Guardian view on stop and search: this can’t go on | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2022/apr/22/the-guardian-view-on-stop-and-search-this-cant-go-on
