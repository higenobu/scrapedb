3/30/2022,"GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) shares were both briefly halted for volatility on Tuesday morning amid a recent rally in 'meme stocks'. Shares of the video game retailer surged to $199 a piece during the morning session before dropping below their opening level. GME ended the day down 5% at $179.90. Cinema chain operator AMC's stock went as high as $34 this morning and ended the session flat at $29.44. The flagship meme stocks have been on a tear over the last week and a half. GameStop shares surged last Wednesday after chairman Ryan Cohen bought 100,000 shares of the video game retailer. Earlier this month AMC announced it was buying a stake in gold and silver miner Hycroft Mining Holding Corp (HYMC). On Monday AMC surged 45% in one day after the cinema chain's CEO Adam Aron told Reuters investors should expect to see more ""transformational"" deals in the future. ""I'd like to think there will be more third-party external M&A announcements going forward where AMC can reach for the stars and intriguing investments that have potentially attractive returns,"" Aron said. AMC and GME are currently the #1 and #2 trending tickers on Yahoo Finance. It's been a volatile quarter for the broader markets as well as meme stocks. Despite the volatility, GameStop and AMC are both positive for the year. Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY), another meme stock, is up around 90% year-to-date.

3/30/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- With all the focus on the risk of default by Russia, an even more spectacular collapse has gone largely unnoticed right next door: There’s a bond crisis brewing in Belarus, which has the world’s worst-performing government debt this year. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: U.S. Skeptical After Russia Vows Kyiv Pullback Ukraine Update: Kyiv Seeks Cease-Fire Deal in Russia Talks Abramovich Suffered Suspected Poisoning During Ukraine Talks World’s Longest Passenger Flight Plans to Avoid Russian Skies Biden’s $5.8 Trillion Budget Would Hike Taxes on the Wealthiest Notes from the key Russian ally, which shares Ukraine’s northern border, have slumped to levels that suggest investors see little hope of getting repaid. Belarus dollar-denominated debt due in 2027 was quoted as low as 6.5 cents on the dollar on March 7, down from 88 cents just days before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They were last quoted at 11.7 cents, an 87% decline from right before the war. Belarus -- whose leader maintained control in a disputed 2020 election -- is a bond-market minnow, with $3.3 billion in foreign obligations and its next dollar payment due in June. And its economy, at around $60 billion as of 2020, was a sliver of Russia’s. But its size and economic dependence on Russia are at the heart of bondholders’ problems -- with less reserves and oil exports, the impact of sanctions is only magnified, and default is seen as all but certain. “Default is very likely, even inevitable,” said Stuart Culverhouse, who has spent 16 years covering sovereign debt restructurings at research firm Tellimer Ltd. “They have been dependent on Russia since the disputed election in August 2020, and that dependence has just increased since the war. It’s a client state of Moscow now.” Investors started ditching Belarus bonds in mid-February as tension around Ukraine escalated. While President Alexander Lukashenko has denied Russia asked Belarus to join the conflict, Russian troops used it as a staging post for the invasion. Ukraine’s border guard also said some shelling has come from Belarus. Some of the sanctions applied to Russia have also been extended to Belarus, a nation of about 9 million people that relied on Russia and Ukraine for more than half of its trade in 2019, according to World Bank data. Analysts predict a severe toll on the economy, which is expected to contract about 6% this year, according to the average of five forecasts compiled by Bloomberg this month. Venla Sipila-Rosen, associate director of economics at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the nation’s economy could contract by 10.5% this year due to the confluence of war, financial and sanction shocks. “Belarus’s economy is so connected with the Russian economy,” she said, explaining that a default would only strengthen that dependence. “It would make it even clearer that they would not have any means of borrowing in any international markets, and make them even more eager to increase their financial linkages with Russia.” 86% Slump Against that backdrop, Belarus dollar bonds have slumped 86% this year on average, the steepest decline across all global government debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show. By comparison, Russian bonds are down 75%, and Ukraine’s have fallen 54%. Holders of Belarus obligations include some of the biggest investors in emerging markets, such as Franklin Resources Inc., Fidelity Investments parent FMR LLC and Capital Group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on the investors’ most recent disclosures. The data include holdings of passive funds, which have little choice in what they buy or sell, and don’t necessarily encompass investors that aren’t required to disclose debt transactions; holders tracked by Bloomberg own about 4% of total debt outstanding. Belarus debt represents less than a fraction of 0.1% of Capital Group’s total assets under management, Tom Joyce, a spokesperson, said via email. In the portfolios that hold it, the positions aren’t material, he said. Fidelity and Franklin Resources didn’t reply to emailed requests for comment. Belarus’s dependence on borrowing was evident at year-end, when its total debt load amounted to about 45% of its gross domestic product, while Russia’s was around 20%, according to Fitch Ratings data. Belarus’s foreign reserves were just $3.9 billion by the end of January, a “temporary buffer” that will likely be exhausted rapidly, Moody’s Investors Service analysts wrote in a statement. Russia’s totaled about $630 billion before the invasion. Belarus “is economically far more vulnerable than Russia, even in a scenario where we see a resolution of the war,” said Jens Nystedt, a senior money manager at Emso Asset Management. For the smaller country, “upside is more limited, while the downside is probably even higher if it directly joins the war.” After breaking away from the Soviet Union, Belarus stayed aligned with Russia, unlike some of its neighbors. Lukashenko has led the country since its first presidential election as an independent republic, in 1994. He maintained control in 2020 despite protests after key challengers were detained or kept off the ballot. This month, Lukashenko took a page from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s playbook by signing a decree to let the government repay foreign-currency debt in the local currency, also called the ruble. That step requires the consent of the Council of Ministers and can be applied when “unfriendly” countries impose restrictions on Belarus, the finance ministry said. Failure to pay the bonds -- or payment in a different currency -- would put Belarus in default, said Timothy Ash, a sovereign debt analyst at BlueBay Asset Management. Smaller countries in the developing world typically turn to the International Monetary Fund when they default, seeking loans often with the condition that they’ll enact economic policies aimed at improving their outlook. That path seems unlikely for Belarus given the U.S. stance on the war. The U.S. has the largest share of voting power in the IMF’s board of directors, which has to approve the lender’s programs before disbursement of funds. The extra yield investors demand to hold Belarus sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries has skyrocketed to almost 12,000 basis points, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. data, far above the level of 1,000 basis points for debt to be considered in distress. S&P Global Ratings says the nation could default within a year if things don’t improve soon. A default is also “increasingly likely” in the view of Moody’s.

3/30/2022,"The news of Tesla (TSLA) laying the groundwork for its second stock split in two years has made analysts and investors optimistic, as shares rallied 8% higher on Monday following the news. According to Wedbush Securities Managing Director Dan Ives, the EV maker is headed down the right path. ""Tesla right now is in a massive position of strength in terms of where they're heading from a manufacturing perspective, in terms of Berlin, as well as Austin and overall demand,"" Ives said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above), later adding: ""They have that high-class problem of a four-digit stock. And I think it's something where you could always have the debate, but a stock split is a smart strategic move for Tesla, just like it was for Amazon, just like it was for Google, as well as for Apple."" A stock split would change the price per share of Tesla's stock but not the overall value of those holdings. A recently Tesla regulatory filing showed the EV manufacture plans to request stockholder approval at its upcoming annual meeting to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock as a way to ""enable a stock split."" In early August 2020, Tesla announced a five-for-one stock spilt that sent the share price to a record high of $2,000. Following the stock split, the price per share was reset to around $460. Tesla shares dipped earlier this month after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the company was facing inflationary pressures. The stock has since rebounded to over $1,000 per share. ""You don't buy it because of a stock split,"" Ives said. ""You buy it because fundamentally where you think it's gonna go, but the stock split is gonna be something that is a catalyst. It's been rumored for the last four or five months. And I think it was smart to get out there."" Tesla's board of directors has approved the management proposal but not yet approved the actual stock split, according to the filing. Ives believes the timing of the stock split announcement is ""bullish"" following Tesla's grand opening in Berlin and the upcoming production factory in Austin, Texas. CEO Elon Musk opened Tesla's first European factory last week in Germany that will employ 12,000 people and produce 500,000 vehicles a year. ""[A] company that's gonna do their second split in two years is not doing it because they're in a position of weakness,"" Ives said. ""I think it shows position of strength, confidence."" And as the company goes through Q1, he added, ""you're going to see more and more momentum, especially from a manufacturing perspective. You got the April 7th barbecue in Austin where that cuts the ribbon there. And despite all the noise, despite all the competition right now, Tesla, at least in EV land, it's really Tesla's world and everyone else paying rent."" Dani Romero is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
