3/18/2022,"Visitor numbers at Britain’s museums, galleries, zoos, castles and country houses increased by 25% last year, but are still down 57% on pre-pandemic levels. Unsurprisingly, figures published on Friday showed striking rises over the year at outdoor attractions. However, those that rely mainly on overseas visitors have yet to claw back pre-2019 numbers. The Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) said its sites had a total of 67.8m visits in 2021, up from 45.4m the previous year, but still significantly down on 2019’s 156.6m. The most-visited attraction was Windsor Great Park, which drew 5.4m visitors – the first time the list was not topped by a London attraction. In second place was the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, which saw a 61% increase in visitors to 1.9m. Chester Zoo, normally the most-visited attraction in England outside London, was in third place. Other outdoor sites in the top 20 included RHS Garden Wisley, Jeskyns community woodland in Kent, Moors Valley country park in Dorset, Longleat in Wiltshire and London Zoo. Overall, sites that are primarily outdoors saw just 17% fewer visitors in 2021 than two years before. Mixed sites such as cathedrals recorded a decline of approximately 51%, and predominantly indoor sites such as museums and galleries saw numbers fall 73% from pre-pandemic levels. The most-visited indoor attraction in the UK was the Natural History Museum, which was in fourth place overall with a 21% increase to 1.5m visits, while the British Museum came sixth, with a 4% increase in visitors. Tate Modern, Britain’s most visited attraction before the pandemic, fell to seventh place after a 19% fall in its annual total, though daily visitor numbers were 60% higher in 2021 than after reopening in 2020. Somerset House, which has some cultural activities in its open-air neoclassical courtyard, bucked the trend with a 36% increase, rising two places to eighth. Sites that provided a figure reported that just 4% of admissions in the past year were from overseas visitors. Bernard Donoghue, director of ALVA, said the figures showed that tourism was “hit first and hit hardest” by Covid-19. “A huge spectrum of those attractions, mostly outdoors, are recovering well, but many, mostly those which are usually heavily dependent on overseas visitors, are still just surviving.” According to Donoghue, overseas visitor numbers are not likely to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2024: “For many of our most iconic attractions, this means not getting back to financial resilience four or five years after having first closed their doors.” He called on the government to reverse its ruling that EU school and youth groups need passports rather than ID cards to travel to the UK. “This has meant that the school and youth market from the EU has suffered considerably.” He added that the decision to end tax-free shopping should also be overturned: “It is making the UK uncompetitive in the highly lucrative retail tourism market, and the reduced level of VAT for accommodation and attractions should be retained for at least the next financial year.” Since 2020, attractions in Scotland have seen a 45% increase in visitors, while London saw the weakest year-on-year rise, with visits up just 17%, compared with 26% for other areas of England. Sites in London were closed for an average of 148 days in 2021. The most-visited Scottish attraction was the National Museum of Scotland (in 20th place overall), followed by Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh.

3/18/2022,"Astroscale has been awarded an €800,000 contract by the European Space Agency (Esa) to lead a study into new systems for avoiding collisions between satellites in space. Tens of thousands of satellites are being planned for launch in the next decade, dwarfing the number sent up since the beginning of the space age. As the skies become more crowded, efficient space traffic management becomes critical. Constant ducking and diving reduces a satellite’s lifespan by depleting its fuel. So the study aims to develop automated systems that can determine the likelihood of orbital collisions with greater accuracy, thus reducing the number of false alarms and unnecessary avoidance manoeuvres. As far as possible, these computations will be performed onboard the individual satellites, removing the need for so much contact with ground controllers. The study will be performed as part of the collision risk estimation and automated mitigation activities within Esa’s safety programme. Based at the Harwell Space Cluster, Astroscale will partner with GMV and OneWeb. In November, at the Paris peace forum, Astroscale and GMV helped launch the Net Zero Space initiative, pledging to “achieve the sustainable use of outer space for the benefit of all humankind by 2030”.",News/Science,Spacewatch: Astroscale to lead Esa space collision avoidance study ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/18/spacewatch-astroscale-to-lead-esa-space-collision-avoidance-study
3/18/2022,"Immunity declines steeply among care home residents in the months after Covid vaccination, a study has found, leading to calls for regular boosters for the most vulnerable. The study of more than 15,000 care home residents found that protection against hospitalisation and death fell by one-third three to seven months after vaccination. The decline is far sharper than that seen in younger people, where immunity against infection wanes, but protection against severe illness appears to be robust. “What we’re seeing is that they are at increased risk of infection, hospitalisation and death as immunity wanes, and those increases look quite big,” said Prof Laura Shallcross, a public health expert at University College London and author of the paper. “That’s not good news at all. “It suggests annual boosters in residents may not be enough,” she added. From April, a second booster (fourth dose), is being offered to adults aged 75 and over and residents in care homes. Further boosters could be rolled out in the autumn, depending on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the health secretary, Sajid Javid said this week. The latest findings, which have been published as a preprint, could be influential in shaping this decision. They come from the Vivaldi study, funded by the UK Health Security Agency, which monitored Covid in staff and residents in 331 care homes across England from December 2020 to December 2021. The researchers found that two vaccine doses were effective at preventing 85% of hospitalisations and 94% of deaths among care home residents between two and 12 weeks after the second dose. But this protection fell to 54% of hospitalisations and 63% of deaths at three to seven months after vaccination. The trajectory looked very different in the 19,000 staff who were also tracked in the study. In staff, with an average age of 45, protection against infection fell just slightly from a 50% to 42% reduced risk after three months. There appeared to be no substantial waning in immunity against severe disease for staff, with very few hospitalisations occurring after vaccination. Once the residents were given a booster, in the autumn, protection against hospitalisation was brought back up to 90% and against deaths to 98%. However, early data suggests that this protection fades in a similar way. “Repeated booster jabs may be needed to protect elderly care home residents in future, as immunity wanes relatively quickly in this group following vaccination,” said Shallcross. “A booster every six months, based on our data, is not unreasonable. In future, if Covid follows a seasonal pattern, it may make sense to give people an autumn booster ahead of a winter surge, as with flu, Shallcross added. But epidemiologists predict that Covid will not settle into a regular seasonal pattern in the next year or two, and there are likely to be erratic spring and summer waves of infection. Shallcross said that while vaccine coverage in care homes was very good, there was a concern that elderly people in the community might underestimate their continued risk from Covid – in particular, in light of recent government messaging has emphasised the need to get back to normal. “People might think they’re protected and not get the next dose, but they might not be as protected as they think,” she said. Prof Danny Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the work, said the findings were important and that the emergence of the Omicron variant had underlined the need for further protection even in younger age groups. “It really supports the strong case for fourth boosts in over-75s, but in fact, as we’re seeing, most of the younger population likely need it just as much,” he said. Ultimately, the hope is that a next generation of vaccines will produce much longer lasting immunity, meaning that repeated boosters will not be necessary, Altmann added.",News/World news,Covid immunity declines steeply in care home residents – study,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/covid-immunity-declines-steeply-in-care-home-residents-study
3/18/2022,"Cases and deaths from Covid-19 have fallen in the US, but warning signs and rises in other countries are prompting experts to take future and existing variants of the virus seriously – and they are warning that America has not yet reached the endemic phase. It’s important to prepare now for the next surge or variant, whether that’s BA. 2 or a different one, experts say. While it’s not yet clear if BA.2, a sublineage of Omicron, will cause another surge so soon on the heels of the first Omicron outbreak, it shows worrying signs of being able to reinfect those who previously recovered from Covid, like its sibling BA.1. Several countries in Europe are seeing another surge now, and early indicators, such as wastewater monitoring, show that cases may start to tick back up in the US. But it’s not clear whether the reason for the surge is because of the variant’s increased transmissibility or its ability to evade immunity, or countries’ relaxed precautions and waning immunity – or all of the above. “​​That’s a really, really hard one to answer definitively, because everything’s happening at the same time,” said Aris Katzourakis, a professor specializing in virus evolution at the University of Oxford. But he and other researchers warned on Monday that other variants will emerge, and they could be more severe than variants we’ve seen before. While Omicron is less severe than Delta, Delta was more severe than previous variants. Scientists are watching BA.2 especially closely for signs that it is adept at reinfection after previous bouts with Covid. “That is the most important and challenging scientific question right now in the field of Sars-CoV-2 epidemiology,” said Samuel Scarpino, a mathematical epidemiologist and managing director of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation’s Pandemic Prevention Institute. “It’s very unusual to see a surge followed by another surge in rapid succession. When that happens, it’s almost always a sign of some kind of immune evasion.” The US is frequently three to four weeks behind surges in the UK, Scarpino said. “I think the signs are all pointing towards there being a surge of BA.2 in the US, but what we’re seeing in Europe has just started to happen over the past week and a half – so it’s still early days, which means there’s a lot of uncertainty.” It’s not yet clear how bad such a wave would be, especially given prior immunity from the recent surge and changes in behavior. “There are more unanswered questions about this than any previous variant,” he said. Understanding the nature of new variants is more complicated than it was when Covid first emerged, he added. Now huge swaths of the population have very different levels of protection, whether from vaccination or from previous infection, which may have occurred one or two years ago and begun to fade. Only 44% of the US population has been boosted. That makes vaccination and booster campaigns all the more important in preparation for coming surges, Scarpino said. “It takes weeks to build up the immunity; sometimes it takes weeks and weeks to get the campaigns rolled out. We really need to be moving on this now.” That’s because there will undoubtedly be another variant of concern, even if BA.2 fizzles, he said. There is “a real and credible risk that there could be another surge coming, and we just need to make sure people are aware of this and that we have plans in place to respond to make sure that we’re not back in the middle of all this again in a month”. Yet the Biden administration has announced that it is running low on Covid funds, which could create massive gaps in its ability to respond to this and other variants. Amid messages of optimism about falling cases from top health officials, momentum on funding Covid initiatives – including testing, treatments, research, wastewater monitoring, hospitalization costs and vaccination – is stalling. Funds could run out by the end of the month for some of these programs. Part of the problem centers around a misunderstanding of what happens when a virus becomes endemic. Endemicity has a very narrow definition in epidemiology. A pathogen is considered endemic when the number of people who are susceptible to the virus balances out the reproduction number, creating a steady number of cases each year. In other words, it’s regular and predictable enough, because populations have a certain level of immunity, that experts have some ability to anticipate what’s going to happen. Some commentators have suggested that the US has already reached this state – and, perhaps more worryingly, have assumed that the virus will inevitably evolve to become milder. “Both of those are problematic,” said Katzourakis, who has also written about the harms of endemic viruses. This virus is still surging out of control, and “we don’t know what and when it’s going to come next”. “Endemic” also doesn’t mean “safe”, Scarpino said – and it doesn’t mean that officials give up on battling the virus. There are many diseases, such as malaria, rotavirus and hepatitis C, that are endemic but still deadly, Katzourakis said. “And we also try our best to manage them – we don’t just let them do their thing.” Endemic viruses, like influenza, also regularly mutate to create epidemics or even pandemics, he said. And “the more the virus circulates uncontrollably in the population, the higher the chance of another variant that’s going to scupper our optimistic hopes will be”. The biggest concern now is that officials seem to be relinquishing control of the virus. “It seems a very, very risky situation to be in,” Katzourakis said. “That’s the real danger here – accepting that we shouldn’t be doing something to control the virus. That part then becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where, by not doing anything, we’re creating a situation that gets ahead of ourselves and causes us even more problems.” That’s one reason why closely monitoring viruses is still important even after they’ve become embedded in human populations. Scarpino compares this kind of work to weather forecasting. “People complain about the accuracy of weather reports a lot, but weather reporting is actually pretty darn accurate,” he said. If schools close due to inclement weather, they usually have an idea of how long those closures will last – think days, not months. The US needs a similar system for pathogen forecasting, he said. “If you have real-time information, we can keep schools open … We can save lives.” A major part of that is having very up-to-date information that’s communicated clearly. Right now, CDC data lags by about two weeks, making it difficult to grasp what’s happening. “I would never decide to carry an umbrella or not, based on a weather forecast from two weeks ago,” Scarpino said. “We know that people will take real-time action on weather data, from things as small as carrying an umbrella or putting on a raincoat to things much bigger like evacuating to get out of the way of a hurricane. We know people will do that. Now we know that that requires delivering data to people in real time, in a trusted way, through formats that they have access to.” Understanding that viruses like Sars-CoV-2 will evolve to pose new threats, and monitoring them carefully, gives leaders time to prepare for major surges. “Early action is always better,” Scarpino said. “If we start to see cases surging, we may need to take more measures. “As much as I and everybody else wants this to be over, it’s not over.”",News/US news,"Prepare for next variant as Covid not yet endemic in US, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/18/us-covid-next-surge-variant-ba2
3/18/2022,"Alexander Serdyuk has stopped talking to his mother. He is nervously watching war edge ever closer to his home in Lviv. She is 1,500 miles (2,400km) to the east in Russia, denying that any of it is actually happening. “I can’t speak with her,” says the 34-year-old Russian who moved to Ukraine 10 years ago. “She doesn’t understand me. She says it’s just Nazis killing each other, and that we are responsible for all this.” “She just doesn’t believe me,” he adds. “We used to speak with each other a lot, but now there’s just no point.” It’s the same for Natasha Henova. She has already fled her home near Kharkiv with her young sons and husband, as the bombs crept ever closer to their village. When she called a cousin who lives near Moscow to update her, however, the conversation was almost as upsetting as the war itself. “She is sympathetic but says that we are being lied to,” says Henova, a 35-year-old English language tutor. “She says it’s all America’s doing. I say OK, but why are Russians hitting us if it’s all about America? She says Ukrainians have been so cruel to people in the Donbas. “She said Ukrainian soldiers must surrender. She even invited me to come to Russia to be with her. I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I’m desperately struggling here to keep Ukraine independent and she invites me to go to Russia.” As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its fourth week, an information war between people on both sides of the border is intensifying. The military onslaught is not just demolishing residential buildings and city centres in Ukraine; it is sorely testing myriad familial cross-border ties that have endured for decades, centuries even. While people in Ukraine can see with their own eyes what is happening to their country, people in Russia do so only through the house of mirrors that is state television, and when those cowering in bunkers send videos and messages about their plight, many (but not all) of the recipients simply dismiss it as fake news. Natalia Ivanivna has Russian parents and grandparents, so when the 62-year-old accountant had to flee Kharkiv earlier this month for a village in western Ukraine, there were plenty of relatives whom she wanted to alert. “Fifteen minutes after the shelling started, I sent them a series of messages: ‘We are being bombed.’ The first question they asked me: ‘Who is doing the bombing – our army or yours?’” Ivanivna says she believes it is fear as much as ignorance that shapes the worldview across the border. “I think they are scared of Putin’s regime, as much as my parents were scared of Stalin’s. Now they just don’t reply. I don’t have anger towards them; I just feel sorry for them.” So pervasive and persuasive is Russian television, that even some people in eastern Ukraine who watch it were taken in by its version of events. Maria Kryvosheyeva, who fled Kharkiv with her two children, has a grandmother who stayed behind, too frail to travel. “She used to only watch Russian television,” Kryvosheyeva says, “and when the war started I noticed she was very calm. She was like, ‘Don’t worry. Putin said everything is OK.’” She changed her tune when Russian forces started bombing Kharkiv. “We turned over to Ukrainian television, which was showing everything, all the destroyed buildings. But Russian TV was showing webcam videos from days earlier and was telling people that everything was normal in Kharkiv. My grandmother started to cry. She said: ‘I can’t believe I’ve been brainwashed all these years.’” About half of Ukrainians – more than 20 million people – have family in Russia, according to a 2011 survey which also found that a third of Ukrainians had friends or acquaintances there. Familial interchange between the two countries has been prolific for centuries, from the early days of empire in the 17th century, through the late Soviet period and into the age of independence, says Orysia Lutsevych, a research fellow at Chatham House. “Remember, Moscow was always the metropolis of the empire,” she says, explaining why so many Ukrainians moved east over the past 300-plus years. “It was an attractive place for people who wanted to make a career. The similarity of the language meant it was easy to go and study there. The best institutes were there, so it was very prestigious to go.” Russians and Ukrainians living in other countries also feel infuriated with the denialism that seems to have infected their relatives. The kind of things they hear include: the war footage is fake; Nazis are running amok; Ukrainians should stay indoors or the fascists will get them. Natasha, a UK-based Russian who didn’t want her surname published, has a Ukrainian father and Russian mother who both now live in western Siberia. Her father’s family are from Vinnytsia, in Ukraine, however, and some of them have already fled to Poland. Natasha asked her dad if he’d spoken to his brother. Her father said yes and that everything was fine – though he couldn’t hear much through the air raid sirens. “I said to him, ‘How can everything be fine if there are air raid sirens? How is that OK?’” She says her mother parrots Russian television, about the suffering of Russian people in eastern Ukraine and the need to protect them. “But this sounds mad to me,” Natasha says, “because my family is Russian-speaking and they are fleeing to Poland.” “When I ask my mother if she’s seen the images, the footage, and what’s happening in the cities, she says they are all fake,” Natasha adds. “It’s so frustrating not to be able to have this conversation. I’m really disappointed that she believes the president instead of me.” Some of this might be generational. Natasha says the older generation grew up through the Soviet period believing that the west was against them, that the only people they could trust were their own leadership. She says there is a deep Russian sense of being the greatest nation on Earth, with the richest resources, a survivor race that can get through anything. “Of course they are going to believe what they have been told.” Forgiveness may take a long time. Lutsevych says there is a very strong sense of ‘we will not forget’ in Ukraine, a determination that when the bombs have stopped falling, war crimes must be punished and people held accountable. She says it will probably take a truth and reconciliation process similar to what happened in South Africa after apartheid for families to be able to speak to each other again. Artur Kolomiitsev, a 28-year-old photographer sticking it out in Kharkiv, is not sure he can forgive. His parents in Russia are understanding, he says, but his aunts, uncles, cousins and grandmother less so. “They don’t believe this war is real. They believe we are bombing ourselves and that our government is on drugs,” he says. “If one day I were to send them a picture of a missile hitting me in the head, maybe only then would they believe me. I don’t want to see them any more. I don’t want to talk to them any more. I will never forgive them.” Natasha Henova doesn’t want to lose touch with her younger cousin, who was clearly also a close friend through their formative years. “Maybe when it’s all over, maybe in a few years, if my family stays alive, maybe I’ll be able to forgive her and understand her.”",News/World news,‘They don’t believe it’s real’: how war has split Ukrainian-Russian families,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/ukraine-russia-families-divided-over-war
3/18/2022,"Ignore Netflix’s “season 2” tag, Top Boy has been around for a while. Ronan Bennett’s drama about “shotting” [selling] “food” [drugs] to make “Ps” [money] on a Hackney council estate, aired for two series on Channel 4 between 2011 and 2013, was cancelled, and then revived for Netflix in 2019, by Drake. The Canadian rapper turned Top Boy superfan was so keen to find out what happened next to Dushane (Ashley “Asher D” Walters), Sully (Kane “Kano” Robinson) and their nascent narcotics empire that he signed on as executive producer. It’s understandable. Top Boy has since evolved into much more, but it always was compulsive viewing. In that third season – or first, by Netflix’s accounting – Top Boy also levelled up. The writing satisfyingly remedied issues over the representation of women and “ghetto” stereotypes, while fresh directors including 2022 Oscar nominees Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard) and Aneil Karia (The Long Goodbye) brought a lyricism that the grit-’n’-grey-sky urban thrillers of yore had often lacked. This Covid-delayed follow-up is welcome then, with one reservation: Dushane and Sully are in their mid-30s now – approximately 93 in roadman years – so surely it’s time to hang up their shotting shoes and retire? It’s a dilemma that any decent drama will encounter if it lasts long enough: logically, characters need to grow up and move on with their lives. But if they do, the show’s dramatic impetus also disappears. This is doubly true in Top Boy, because men like Dushane and Sully derive not just status but identity from their Summerhouse estate “endz”. Stray too far from that place, or from each other, and Top Boy loses its reason to exist. With this in mind, there are ominous signs in season four’s early episodes. Much of the action takes place in Spain and Morocco, where Dushane is attempting to shore up his supply lines. When he does return, it’s not to Summerhouse, but to the fancy, open-plan apartment he’s acquired for himself and girlfriend Shelley (Simbiatu “Little Simz” Ajikawo). Sully, too, is elsewhere, living in a canal boat where he can brood over past betrayals, interrupted only by a weekly money drop. So Top Boy seems to be shark-jumping faster than youngers scaling a fence when the feds roll up. Stick with it anyway and by mid-season you’ll be glad you did. Stay in there just to watch Jaq (Jasmine Jobson), Dushane’s shrewd enforcer, who’s rapidly become one of the show’s most interesting characters. Can she open up emotionally to a posh-totty new love interest (Vogue cover model Adwoa Aboah), avenge a homophobic hate crime and effect a complicated reconciliation with her exiled sister, Lauryn (Saffron Hocking)? You’ll stick around, too, for instantly engaging new characters such as tearaway Tia (Conya Toccara) whose impish grin leads Stefan (Araloyin Oshunremi) away from school and into mischief, just like Ats (Keiyon Cook) used to do. And what has become of the mysteriously awol Ats? About once a series, it seems, some sweet urchin must be sacrificed to placate the god of Ps. First Gem, then Jason … now Ats? Ultimately, we’re all at the mercy of Dushane and his now-you-see-it-now-you-don’t conscience. Even in a cast full of rappers who – impressively – really can act, Kano was a standout last series, making Sully’s expressive face the prism through which Top Boy explored all the inhumanity of Britain’s immigration policy. This series it’s inner-city gentrification and newly minted property developer Dushane who finds himself at odds with the rest of the estate’s residents. He’s unrepentant, as he tells his mum and anyone else who asks: “Summerhouse is a shithole. I’m actually doing everyone a favour.” Maybe Dushane really is selfish enough to throw his community to the developer wolves, just to facilitate his own escape. Part of Top Boy’s brilliance is that it could go either way. We see characters act with tender kindness in one moment, then ruthless brutality in the next, and none of their deeds – good or bad – cancels out the others. Dushane, Sully, Jamie, Jaq: they’re all ruthless, reprehensible bastards, who you desperately want the best for. By revealing the emotional, psychological ties that keep people connected to home – “shithole” or otherwise – Top Boy makes its point and resolves that plotting problem about Sully and Dushane’s age in one. Like these forceful, resourceful anti-heroes, the show always comes out on top.

3/18/2022,"Priti Patel’s plans to process asylum seekers abroad are facing a Conservative rebellion next week, with MPs calling the proposal “clearly ridiculous” ahead of a vote on the nationality and borders bill. Amendments circulated among senior Tories include attempts to scupper government plans to set up offshoring centres and a proposal to instead create a global resettlement scheme to accept 10,000 people a year from war-torn regions. Rebels believe they could gather the support of dozens of MPs on Tuesday, when the controversial bill returns to the Commons, after a softening in attitudes in the wake of the Ukrainian refugee crisis. They remain unsure whether they have enough support to overturn the government’s 77-seat working majority, however. In an email circulated among potential rebels, the former chief whip Andrew Mitchell described the government’s offshoring plans as “a moral, financial and practical failure”, adding that the suggestion the government could use Ascension Island, a remote UK territory in the Atlantic Ocean, as a processing centre was “absurd” and risks exposing women and children to abuse. “We would have to build a British Guantánamo Bay and [use] RAF planes,” he wrote. He also claimed that the cost to taxpayers would be £2m per person, adding: “If we were to place asylum seekers at the Ritz [hotel] it would only cost £250k a year.” Ministers see Australian-style offshore processing centres – to which migrants would be flown within seven days of arriving in the UK – as a key potential deterrent to stem the record surge in Channel crossings. At the same time, the government appears to be observing a softening in public attitudes towards asylum seekers amid the war in Ukraine. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said: “I find it hard to image that in the current climate they are going to send Ukrainian asylum seekers offshore if they arrive here by boat. If you can’t do it to a Ukrainian asylum seeker, how are you going to do it to anyone else?” The former Home Office minister Damian Green also plans to rebel and support an amendment passed in the Lords that sets up a permanent, legal route for asylum seekers. Conservatives are being urged to support an amendment to create a “safe statutory resettlement scheme which can be ‘flexed in response to crises’”. Referring to Ukraine, the email reads: “Never again should the government experience the chaos of the last few weeks or the months of chaos following the fall of Kabul.” The bill returns to the Commons after the Lords voted to remove clause 28, which would allow asylum seekers to be removed from the UK and sent overseas to a third country for their asylum claim to be processed. Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, said on Thursday that the proposal to move refugees abroad while their claims are processed would violate their rights. “The proposed offshore processing centres would expose asylum seekers to real risks of forced transfers, extended periods of isolation and deprivation of liberty, violating their human rights and dignity,” said Bachelet, who was jailed and tortured under the Pinochet regime in Chile. Patel has signalled that she wishes to go ahead with offshore plans. Last month, she recruited the former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer to review the country’s border force, weeks after he had urged the UK to adopt a hardline on boat migrants. But so far, the search to find a willing venue to base an offshore centre has been knocked back. Officials from Albania and Ghana have denied claims from Home Office officials that they are in talks to set up a processing centre. So far this year, the UK authorities have rescued or intercepted 2,923 people making the dangerous journey in 97 boats. Last year that figure was not reached until 13 May. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our nationality and borders bill … will fix our broken asylum system so we prevent people from making dangerous journeys to the UK and protect the those in need through safe and legal routes. “The Lords’ votes … are disappointing, but we will not be deterred from delivering what the people of this country voted for.”",News/Politics,Patel’s plans to process asylum seekers abroad facing Tory rebellion,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/18/patels-plans-to-process-asylum-seekers-abroad-facing-tory-rebellion
3/18/2022,"Dead corals are being recorded in aerial surveys across the Great Barrier Reef in what the marine park’s chief scientist says is a widespread and serious bleaching event on the world heritage icon. Aerial surveys have covered half of the 2,300km reef, with the worst bleaching observed in the park’s central region off Townsville, where corals on some reefs are dead and dying. The unfolding bleaching comes ahead of a 10-day UN monitoring mission to the reef due to start on Monday. Leading reef scientist Prof Terry Hughes said this week a sixth mass bleaching event was now unfolding on the reef, adding to events in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, told Guardian Australia: “There is certainly a risk we are seeing a mass bleaching event, but we aren’t in a position to confirm that yet. “We want to finish the aerial surveys to really understand this before we make a call on the extent and severity of this bleaching.” Lobbying last year by the Morrison government saw the 21-country world heritage committee go against UN advice to put the reef on a list of sites in danger. The committee will consider the reef again at a meeting in June, armed with a report from the UN visit. Aerial surveys from helicopters that started last Saturday have revealed mild to moderate bleaching driven by rising ocean temperatures on reefs in the remote far north, with the most badly hit reefs across a 250km stretch to the north and south of Townsville. Most reefs in that central region, between Hinchinbrook Island and Bowen, were severely bleached and there were still reefs not yet surveyed there. Bleaching is considered minor if less than 10% of corals on an individual reef are bleached. Levels up to 30% are categorised as moderate, up to 60% is major and beyond that, bleaching is considered severe. “We certainly have widespread bleaching. It’s variable,” Wachenfeld said. “The fact that at the very least, from Hinchinbrook to Bowen, most reefs are severely bleached – this is a very serious event. There is no question about that. Some of the observations in that region have been of coral mortality. “That is where the heat stress has been worst. We haven’t yet surveyed all that area, but I would expect that situation of most reefs being severely bleached would go north and south of Bowen.” Aerial surveys started while the heat stress was still building across large parts of the reef. Wachenfeld said rather than wait until the heat had peaked, the flights had started because “we are starting to see coral die.” When a coral bleaches, the transparent flesh and white skeleton are easy to see from the air. But if it dies, the flesh begins to rot and is quickly taken over by algae which is darker in colour. “You then can’t see from the air that a living coral was there a week ago,” said Wachenfeld. Flights are expected to continue until the end of next week. Planes will be used to survey outer reefs in the south. Surveys have not yet been conducted over the major tourism areas around Cairns and Port Douglas, but heat stress has been lower in those areas. In the remote north, Wachenfeld said some reefs had not recovered from a severe 2016 bleaching event. Reports of “no bleaching” from this week’s flights were down to there being little live coral left. Dr Britta Schaffelke, director of Great Barrier Reef research at the Australian Institute of Marine Science – a partner in the survey effort – told Guardian Australia it was too early to know how the current event compared to previous ones. “At the moment, what we see is widespread and in some parts it is severe and that is worrying. There is no doubt about it,” she said. While some bleached corals can recover, those badly hit can take weeks or months to die from bleaching, so the full impact of the current event will take a long time to fully understand. “It’s a major stress event for corals even if they don’t die from it. There is no historical record of such stress events happening so frequently,” Schaffelke said. Richard Leck, head of oceans at WWF Australia, said bleaching was directly attributable to global heating caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions. “Reducing Australia’s domestic and exported emissions fast, this decade, is the main solution within our control,” he said. The environment group released analysis on Friday showing that for Australia to be part of efforts to keep global heating to 1.5C, the country should release no more than 4bn tonnes of CO2 between now and mid-century. But the analysis, carried out by scientists, said the Morrison government’s current strategy to reach net zero would release 9.6bn tonnes. “We’re going to blow our emissions budget by more than double,” said Leck. Dr Zebedee Nicholls, one of the scientists that carried out the analysis, said: “The science is clear: the outlook for coral reefs around the world is bad at 1.5C, and their fate is all but sealed at 2C.” Greenpeace Australia climate impacts campaigner Martin Zavan said: “This latest bleaching event has once again exposed the Morrison government’s failure to protect the Great Barrier Reef, throwing billions at band-aid measures while failing to address climate change, the biggest driver of catastrophic coral damage.” Kelly O’Shanassy, chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said: “If the federal government is serious about its claim of wanting to protect the Great Barrier Reef it must rapidly phase out coal, oil and gas and stop encouraging the growth of fossil fuel industries.” Dr Lissa Schindler, reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the unfolding bleaching was “disastrous news” for the marine and communities that relied on the reef. “What is most concerning is that this widespread bleaching is happening during a La Niña weather event, which is normally characterised by rain and cloud cover on the east coast of Australia often helping to cool waters. It shows the consistent pressure our reef is now under from global heating.” Guardian Australia has approached the environment minister, Sussan Ley, for comment about the bleaching.",News/Environment,Dead coral found at Great Barrier Reef as widespread bleaching event unfolds,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/18/dead-coral-found-at-great-barrier-reef-as-widespread-bleaching-event-unfolds

3/18/2022,"Last time I was here, the beach was packed with grey seals, and fluffy white pups were strewn in the dunes. It was bittersweet: amazing to see the thriving colony but painful to observe a group of people walking close to a youngster positioned on the path, as if an inconvenient traffic bollard had blocked their way. The seal looked distressed, thrashing, big-eyed. Today, the beach is all mine. No seals and hardly any people. The seals are mainly out at sea now, although the wardens who protect the breeding colony still have plenty to do, rescuing those trapped or injured by rubbish. Perhaps worst are the seals “necklaced” by flying frisbee rings, suffering from severe lacerations. A few carcasses of young seals decompose on the sand; babies that didn’t make it. The sky is breathtakingly blue, and the sun carries a hint of warmth before it is whipped away by an ear-chilling wind. It’s a day where I need to cry at the sea – do you ever have those? For reasons we are collectively sharing, but also for some all of my own. The dead seals make ideal companions, but a grey head pops out of the water too and watches me, the perfect comic offset to my moment of grief and fear. I walk along the sealine towards Hemsby, shocked anew at how much and how rapidly the coast has changed. Vast chunks of land have been eaten up by the sea. Here, it is obvious that Norfolk is on the frontline of sea-level rise and climate change. We are standing on such shifting sands. I turn inland, into the dunes knitted together with marram grass, where everything is warmer and sheltered. The gorse shines out, vivid yellow, coconut sweet, and I’m surrounded by skylarks. It’s said that “when gorse is in bloom, ’tis the season for kissing”, the in-joke being that gorse flowers most of the year. There are at least a dozen skylarks, all foolish and giddy, swooping and frolicking in pairs or threes. One rises, helicopter-high, that scratchy bright song so full of energy.
