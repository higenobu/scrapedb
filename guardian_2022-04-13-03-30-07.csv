4/13/2022,"Richard Wigglesworth batted away suggestions that his Leicester Tigers teammates must safeguard against complacency before their Champions Cup match against Clermont on Saturday. After a famous 29-10 win in France in the first leg last weekend, they are all but assured of a place in the last eight of Europe’s premier competition. “It wouldn’t be on any of the players’ lips,” Wigglesworth said of such premature talk. “Steve [Borthwick] has created an environment where anyone wouldn’t dare breathe, hopefully even think about it. We have to attack this weekend.” Wigglesworth, who also serves as an assistant coach, was glowing in his praise of head coach Borthwick and explained how the former England captain has transformed the club into such a formidable outfit. Before Borthwick’s arrival at the start of the 2020 campaign, Leicester were a team in decline. Two consecutive 11th place finishes in the Premiership was an abject return for the 10-times champions. In his first season, Borthwick took the team to sixth in the league and also reached the Challenge Cup final, losing by a point against Montpellier in Twickenham. This year, few would be surprised if they secured a historic domestic and continental double. “He is as on-task as anyone I’ve met,” Wigglesworth said of Borthwick’s approach. “There is a non-stop need for the next minute, hour, day, week to be really good. He’s doing what he should be doing, which is leading. That is where he is most comfortable, that is where he excels. He’s just really skilled but still authentic. Really skilled with his language, with his demeanour, the tone of his voice, the list goes on.” Beyond Borthwick’s philosophy, Wigglesworth has his own experience to serve as a ballast to any complacency. He was part of the last English team to win in Clermont with Sale Sharks in 2008 but was on the losing side in the next round at home to Munster. “We thought we were better than we were,” Wigglesworth said of that defeat 14 years ago. “[Leicester] haven’t done anything yet.” Perhaps not, but Wigglesworth has, particularly with Saracens where he won nine major trophies including three European Cups. Is this Leicester team on its way to replicating those feats? Like a disciple of Borthwick, Wigglesworth downplayed the comparison. “This is a team that’s won zero [trophies] and was the worst team in the league 18 months ago,” he said. “I’d be pretty bonkers to think those two teams are comparable at the moment.”",Sport/Sport,Richard Wigglesworth says fired-up Leicester ‘have to attack’ Clermont,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/12/richard-wigglesworth-says-fired-up-leicester-have-to-attack-clermont
4/13/2022,"After briefly dropping in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) then resurged beyond 2019 levels to finish the year at a record high, according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Researchers with the CDC said its report, 2020 Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance, shows how Covid-19 disrupted in-person healthcare and diverted scarce public health resources away from STIs, which had been on the rise for years. Ultimately, diverting resources to Covid-19 caused young people, racial minorities and gay and bisexual men to suffer disproportionately from new infections, it said. The new data provides “the clearest picture yet of [the impact of] Covid-19 on STIs”, said Dr Jonathan Mermin, director of the CDC’s National Center for HIV, viral hepatitis, STD and tuberculosis prevention. “Honestly, there’s just much to be done.” The CDC’s new report covers 2020, the first year of the pandemic and a time defined by lockdowns, social distancing and fear. The new report covers rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis. Early in 2020, it appeared social distancing might reduce rates of STIs. However, by the end of the year few infections had surged past levels seen in 2019. In just one example, rates of gonorrhea had jumped 10% by year’s end, said Mermin. Those increased rates were driven by a lack of in-person appointments, delayed health screenings, lapses in health insurance for people who lost jobs and “crumbling public health infrastructure” that diverted contact tracers and testing supplies to Covid-19. In 2020, reported cases of gonorrhea increased 10% and primary and secondary syphilis (two stages of the disease, with different symptoms) 7% compared with 2019. Especially worrying was the rate of congenital syphilis, or syphilis passed from mother to newborn, which increased 15% from 2019 and is up 235% compared with 2016. Rates of chlamydia declined 13% in 2020, but researchers said the decline was not something to celebrate. Rather, chlamydia is typically asymptomatic and detected in in-person screenings such as pap smears. Because people put off these visits in 2020, cases probably went undiagnosed. What’s more, groups that suffered disproportionately from new infections, such as racial and ethnic minorities, are among the same groups who were disproportionately affected by Covid-19. STIs also especially affected the young and poor. “Some racial and ethnic minority groups continue to experience higher rates of STDs,” and half of new infections are among 15- to 24-year-olds, said Dr Leandro Mena, director of CDC’s division of STD prevention. For decades, the US has spent more on healthcare than any other country, yet has worse health outcomes than many other developed nations. Such high rates of STIs among people with fewer resources are a reflection of “the nation’s failure to provide sufficient healthcare for everyone who needs it”, said Mena. Although the 2020 data is grim, researchers said there were bright spots. For example, testing capacity and contact-tracing staffing have stabilized since 2020, and are reaching pre-pandemic levels – though that may be because many health departments have given up or significantly scaled back contact-tracing for Covid-19 following the Omicron surge. The federal government also released the first national five-year plan to combat STIs, and has invested $200m to build public health capacity. The hope, said researchers, was to avoid disrupting services for diseases such as STIs should another emergency occur.",News/US news,US sexually transmitted infections surged to record high in 2020,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/12/us-sexually-transmitted-infections-record-2020
4/13/2022,"Vladimir Putin has insisted that his bloody campaign in Ukraine will continue until its “noble” goals have been achieved, arguing that the invasion was proceeding as planned, despite fierce Ukrainian resistance and heavy losses among Russian forces. “We will achieve our objectives, there are no doubts,” Putin told workers at the Vostochny cosmodrome in Russia’s far east, in his first public comments on the war since his forces were forced to retreat from northern Ukraine more than a week ago. “Its goals are absolutely clear and noble,” Putin said of Russia’s military campaign while standing alongside his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, during a visit to mark the 61st anniversary of the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin’s first human space flight. It was only his second public appearance in a week, after a brief appearance at the funeral of the ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, where he made no direct mention of the war. His recent low profile has marked a stark change for a leader who was ubiquitous on Russian television in the early days of the war. Speaking later at a televised news conference, Putin dismissed Ukrainian testimony that Russian troops had executed civilians in Bucha, comparing the killings to what he claimed were western staged chemical weapons attacks in Syria aimed at incriminating Russia’s ally Bashar al-Assad. “It’s the same kind of fake in Bucha,” Putin said. It was not clear whether Putin meant that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were staged or that the civilians had been killed by Ukrainians, two contradicting versions that have been heavily promoted by Russian officials and state media. Ukraine has accused the Russian military of executing civilians in Bucha, a town outside the capital, Kyiv, that Russian troops occupied for several weeks before withdrawing. Western countries are working with Ukraine in a joint investigation to gather evidence of possible Russian war crimes. Lukashenko described the atrocities of Bucha as a “British special operation”, without citing evidence. “If you need addresses, passwords, car numbers, car brands on which they arrived in Bucha and how they did it, the FSB [spy agency] of the Russian Federation can provide this information. If not, we can help with that,” said the Belarussian leader, who has previously claimed that Ukraine was planning to invade his country. Putin also said sanctions imposed on his country would not have their desired effect, drawing an analogy between Russia’s situation today and that of the Soviet Union in 1961, when Gagarin became the first man in space. “The sanctions were total, the isolation was complete, but the Soviet Union was still first in space,” Putin said. “The blitzkrieg which our foes were counting on did not work,” Putin added, referring to the unprecedented western sanctions imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. At times the Russian leader appeared to ramble or stammer, in stark contrast to the icy, confident demeanour that he normally displays. A recurring theme in Putin’s remarks on Tuesday was that war with Ukraine, which will soon enter its third month, had been “inevitable”. “We were forced to this … Ukraine began to turn into an anti-Russian foothold. They began to grow sprouts of nationalism and neo-nazism … And a clash with these forces was inevitable for Russia,” Putin said. “They were just picking a time for an attack … It was inevitable, it was only a matter of time.” He added that the invasion, which has so far cost tens of thousands of lives and driven more than 10 million Ukrainians from their homes, was “the right thing to do”. Sam Green, a professor in Russian politics and the director of the Russia Institute at King’s College London, said that from the start of the crisis Putin had framed Russia’s actions in Ukraine as an “existential threat”. “This whole war has been built around the rhetoric that Russia has been under an existential threat. That this war was forced upon Russia. While goals and objectives might shift throughout this war, Putin simply can’t abandon this type of existential rhetoric,” he said. Green said this rhetoric appeared to have caught on in Russia, pointing to the genuine support the war seemed to have among swaths of the population. “Putin wants to make sure there isn’t a single doubt left why it is waged and why all the pain and sacrifices are justified.”",News/World news,Vladimir Putin insists Russia will achieve its ‘noble’ goals in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/vladimir-putin-insist-russia-will-achieve-noble-goal-ukraine-dismiss-bucha-killing-fake
4/13/2022,"The prime minister and the chancellor broke the law. That is the finding of the Metropolitan police investigation, which will result in fixed-penalty notices for the two men. To be more precise: Boris Johnson broke the life-saving rules that he set, and which others made immeasurable sacrifices to follow, in the very place where they were formulated – then denied having done so. Through his actions and his subsequent remarks, he has treated the public with contempt. While parties took place in Whitehall, hundreds of parents, spouses, siblings and friends were dying each day. Families were unable to see vulnerable relatives in care homes. Doctors and nurses on the frontline could not gather to comfort each other after gruelling shifts. The Met is investigating no fewer than 12 gatherings, and has handed out 50 fixed-penalty notices; with the prime minister alleged to have attended as many as six events, he could yet face more fines. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group observed: “It is still unbelievably painful that Boris Johnson was partying and breaking his own lockdown rules, while we were unable to be at our loved ones’ sides in their dying moments, or in miserable funerals with only a handful of people.” That Mr Johnson should have lied when challenged over his behaviour is hardly surprising, given his record. But the ministerial code of conduct is clear: “Ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation.” Mr Johnson told parliament that he had been repeatedly assured that there were no parties and that no Covid rules were broken. Asked about two events in late 2020, Rishi Sunak assured MPs: “I did not attend any parties.” The opposition is right to say that they should go. According to a snap YouGov poll, 57% of voters agree. Each day that Mr Johnson remains in place, he diminishes the highest office in the land. Yet no one expects him to do the honourable thing and, conveniently for those concerned, the Met has issued these fines while parliament is in Easter recess. The integrity of British government is now in the hands of Conservative MPs. While cabinet ministers proved notably quiet on Tuesday, backbenchers who had previously demanded his resignation drew back from the brink, citing Ukraine – though Britain has previously changed prime ministers even when at war itself. Others point to the paucity of suitable replacements. Many are waiting for the judgment of the public in May’s local elections. Meanwhile, Mr Sunak, who looked like a rising star when handing out furlough cash, this week asked for an investigation into his own financial affairs after news of his wife’s non-dom tax status and the couple’s US green cards emerged. There could hardly be a more glaring contrast than the one between his treatment of the country’s poorest as the cost-of-living crisis takes hold – snatching back the £20 boost to universal credit – and his family’s gilded lifestyle. The lockdown breaches will magnify growing public anger at the kind of country this government is creating: the sense that there is one set of rules for those in power and another for the rest of us; the feeling that it is their world, built by them and for them, in which the rest can only struggle by. It is hard to think of a conclusion more corrosive to democracy, and to a society already deeply riven. Tory MPs can choose to ignore the ministerial code of conduct, trashing the standards of government. They can choose to ignore Mr Johnson’s actions. But they should remember that the public will ultimately judge them as well as their boss if they give him a free pass – and rightly so. Treat voters with contempt and you should expect them to respond in kind.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on partygate: a test of our democracy | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-partygate-a-test-of-our-democracy
4/13/2022,"Amazon, notoriously, does not like trade unions very much. In 2021, America’s wealthiest corporation spent around $4.3m (£3.3m) hiring consultants to help keep them out of its warehouses. For years, the tech giant has waged scandalous campaigns across the US to discourage its million-strong workforce from seeking formal representation. At mandatory “captive audience” meetings, employees have been required to listen to anti-union lectures from their managers – and draw the right conclusions. Perceived troublemakers have allegedly been harassed and dismissed. And until this month, the bullying strategy had a 100% success rate. All of which makes the pioneering establishment of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) in New York a minor miracle, as well as a landmark moment. Defying the usual playbook of scare tactics and dirty tricks – and a lavishly funded “vote no” campaign – Staten Island warehouse workers voted on 1 April to form the first Amazon union outside Europe. A second New York warehouse will stage a similar vote later this month, and staff at more than 50 other Amazon sites have contacted the Staten Island organisers for advice and support. “The revolution is here!” one ALU coordinator told the Guardian at the weekend. “Revolution” may be overstating it, but something is in the air. For decades, a decline in union membership in America has been accompanied by a corresponding rise in social inequality. But US public support for unions has risen significantly in recent years, and there are signs that labour shortages are encouraging employees to take greater risks in demanding better pay and working conditions. Under Joe Biden’s presidency, the National Labor Relations Board has been become far more proactive in defending the right to organise and following up on cases of employee victimisation. A tangible effect is beginning to be seen. On the same day as the Staten Island vote, baristas at a New York Starbucks formed the 10th branch of the Starbucks Workers United union – an organisation that only achieved its first breakthrough in Buffalo in December. Employees at more than 170 Starbucks stores across the US are now contemplating following suit. Perhaps most significantly of all, a new generation may be on the move; younger workers were at the heart of the ALU campaign, opting to start an independent movement from scratch rather than relying on outside help from traditional unions. Startup energy, creative use of social media, barbecues paid for by GoFundMe and two years of listening to workers’ concerns did the trick. The postwar heyday of the great industrial unions will not come back. But that does not mean that modern workforces must be condemned to the exploitative, controlling tendencies exemplified by Amazon. The ALU’s victory has set an inspiring precedent. Having been so unexpectedly humiliated, Amazon last week announced that it would seek to legally overturn the Staten Island vote on technical grounds. Its New York executives should instead resign themselves to sitting down and bargaining with a workforce that it has treated with disdain. Hopefully, there will be many more such negotiations to come.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Amazon’s first American union: inspiration from New York | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/12/the-guardian-view-on-amazons-first-american-union-inspiration-from-new-york
4/13/2022,"Perhaps the most damaging aspect of Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak receiving fines for breaking lockdown laws is the fact the pair have publicly denied any wrongdoing. Here is a look back at some of the denials made by the prime minister and his chancellor. After the Mirror’s first story about Christmas parties in Downing Street broke, Johnson responded to the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, who had asked if a party was held at No 10 on 18 December 2020. Speaking at prime minister’s questions, he said: What I can tell the right honourable and learned gentleman is that all guidance was followed completely in No 10. When asked on Sky News why he would not explain his account of the allegations, Johnson said: Because I have told you and what I want to repeat … that the guidance is there and I am very, very keen that people understand this. When asked about alleged Downing Street parties held in December, the prime minister told BBC News: All the guidelines were observed. After footage of Allegra Stratton joking about a Christmas party was released, Johnson told the Commons: I repeat that I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken. When asked again about alleged Downing Street parties by Sky News, Johnson replied: I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules … all that is being looked into. At a No 10 press conference, the prime minister told journalists: On your point about rules, I follow the rules. After the Guardian revealed pictures of people, including the prime minister, at drinks in the Downing Street garden on 15 May 2020, Johnson said: Those were people at work, talking about work. I have said what I have to say about that. The prime minister apologised to parliament and admitted attending a gathering but at this point he continued to stress that he thought it was a “work event”. He said: I believed implicitly that this was a work event, but with hindsight, I should have sent everyone back inside. In an interview with Sky News, when asked if he broke lockdown rules, Sunak replied “no”, adding that Johnson had his “total support”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson and Rushi Sunak: timeline of denials,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/boris-johnson-rushi-sunak-timeline-denials
4/13/2022,"Contradictory, explosive accounts of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s tumultuous three-year marriage have been presented to jurors on the opening day of Depp’s libel case against his ex-wife in a US court, with Depp’s lawyers accusing Heard of fabricating domestic violence claims against him to advance her own career. Heard’s attorneys, meanwhile, argued that her allegations are true, she had a right to express her views, “and all Mr Depp has wanted to do is humiliate Amber, to haunt her, to wreck her career”. Opposing profiles of the movie stars – with Heard’s counsel presenting Depp as “an obsessed ex-husband hellbent on revenge” and Heard described as a woman who would “resort to physical violence, throwing things, to prevent Mr Depp from leaving” – were heard during opening statements. “Today, his name is associated with a lie. A statement issued by his former wife,” Depp’s attorney Ben Chew said on Tuesday. “You will learn during the trial that Miss Heard’s accusations were prompted by Mr Depp’s request for a divorce.” Heard’s attorney later said they would present evidence during the trial to show that Depp had described “the violent side of himself as the monster” while engaging in “crushing drug and alcohol abuse”. “Amber Heard never wanted to unearth for the public who the real Johnny Depp is,” her attorney Ben Rottenborn said. “But that’s going to come out over the course of this trial.” The estranged couple arrived at the court in Fairfax, Virginia – Depp in a dark blue suit, black shirt and cream tie; Heard in a grey blazer with her hair in a low bun – amid a throng of fans, whom they have both been instructed to avoid. Depp’s attorneys claimed Heard’s opinion article in the Washington Post, published on the eve of the cinema release of Aquaman, in which she acted, “falsely and unfairly cast Mr Depp as a villain”. The actor, said his attorney Camille Vasquez, will “go to his grave knowing that whatever he does there will always be people who believe he abused a woman”. Vasquez also accused Heard of stagecraft. “She has been living and breathing this lie for years now,” she said. “She is preparing to give the performance of a lifetime in this trial.” Heard’s attorney’s countered that Depp’s accusations against his ex-wife were designed to “mislead you” and their client’s case was about her right to free speech under the first amendment. “That’s what you’re being asked to decide,” said J Ben Rottenborn, an attorney for Heard. The lawyer also noted that Depp is trying to prove “the words Miss Heard used were about him and were false … and he can’t do that”. “Mr Depp’s team is going to try to turn this case into a soap opera. Why, I’m not sure, because the evidence isn’t pretty for Mr Depp.” The mudslinging, which will probably last seven weeks, is unlikely to do either actor’s career any favors. Both claim their reputations have been significantly damaged by the other, but it is Depp who brought the defamation action on the basis of the 2018 Washington Post article in which Heard wrote about domestic violence towards women – and implied, according to Depp, that he was the perpetrator. Depp, 58, is suing Heard, 35, for $50m over the article; Heard is counter-suing for $100m. For Depp to prevail, jurors must “prove by clear and convincing evidence” that Heard knowingly made false claims – a standard of proof that is typical of civil cases and is somewhat less rigorous that “beyond reasonable doubt”. Trial observers have noted that Depp is not suing the Washington Post itself, which some have said suggests that his action may not be fundamentally about libel, but about the messy end of a turbulent marriage acted out in public. Some famous faces are expected to testify, including the actor Paul Bettany, who texted with Depp about Heard; the actor James Franco, who allegedly once asked Heard about bruises on her face after a row with Depp; the actor Ellen Barkin; and the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, who is Heard’s former boyfriend.",Arts/Film,Johnny Depp-Amber Heard trial: jurors hear conflicting accounts of marriage,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/12/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-opening-day
4/13/2022,"Long queues spilling out of Australian airport terminals are continuing to make the news. Airport chiefs say chaotic scenes at departure halls have been fuelled by a range of factors set to come to a head over Easter and the Anzac day holiday. Security companies have been desperately sourcing more staff, health departments have relaxed isolation rules to reduce absenteeism, and airline bosses have backtracked after appearing to blame travellers for long delays. So why are Australia’s airports in such a state of chaos at the moment? And will it get worse before it gets better? When did the problem start – and why? The long queues at Australian airports – particularly domestic departure halls – rose to prominence last week, but the aviation industry was aware of potential issues well before then. On 28 March, Sydney airport warned domestic travellers to arrive two hours before their flight’s departure time – up from the traditionally recommended one hour. The airport predicted it would be busier than any time in the preceding two years as people started travelling following Covid lockdowns and disruptions. At the same time, it was down staff after struggling to recruit workers following the lengthy pandemic-related shutdowns. The Sydney airport chief executive, Geoff Culbert, told ABC TV on Tuesday “on any given day we’re operating at 60% of pre-Covid staffing levels dealing with 90% of pre-Covid passenger levels and the maths leads you to where you are”. He insisted the airport was recruiting back in December “but we just can’t get the people into the roles”. Queues at security checkpoints – which travellers must go through after checking their baggage – have been the source of the delays. Certis, the private company that Sydney airport contracts to provide passenger security services, was working in advance to rebuild a workforce reduced during the pandemic. The recent spike in Covid cases and an associated rise in staff being forced to isolate – whether as cases or close contacts – further complicates matters. Security and airport staff who are household contacts of a Covid case had – like the general population – been required to isolate for seven days, drastically reducing the ability of airports and airlines to maintain already depleted workforces. Hell is… this at 5am.🤦🏻 @SydneyAirport @JetstarAirways pic.twitter.com/Gq8VaKD5Az At Sydney, security queues have become so bad that passengers have reported missing connecting international flights when transiting between terminals. At times, only a fraction of the security checkpoint lanes have been open. Even with passengers arriving two hours before flights, long queues have been forming before 5am – well before the airport’s curfew lifts. Back office, IT and retail staff have been moved to the departure hall to comb through crowds to prioritise passengers at risk of missing their flight. Have the queues only been at Sydney airport? No. Sydney airport appears to have experienced the most significant delays but travellers at other major airports, including Melbourne and Brisbane, have also been hit with long delays at the departure gates. Warnings that domestic travellers should arrive two hours before their flight’s scheduled departure have also been issued to travellers at these airports. Sydney airport has warned the delays will get worse before they get better. It expects this Thursday, 14 April, to be its busiest day since the start of the pandemic with about 80,000 passengers passing through the domestic terminal. Brisbane is expecting 50,000 visitors on Thursday. What’s being done to fix this all? Pleas for passengers to arrive two hours before their flight’s departure have eased queues at certain times in recent days, but pressure points remain. Since the chaos began last week, the Victorian and New South Wales health departments have tweaked their Covid isolation rules for household contacts of positive cases. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Air transport service staff – including security personnel at airports – are now recognised as critical workers. That means they are exempt from the requirement to isolate for seven days if a close contact of a case – provided they are symptom-free. Workers whose absence would pose a high risk of disruption as determined by their employer qualify for the new rule. However, they must travel directly from their home to work, must wear a mask at all times, and are required to frequently test themselves for Covid over the course of what would have been their isolation period. Is easing the isolation rules for airport workers Covid-safe? This isn’t an easy question to answer. Assessing the implications for Covid transmission, Peter Collignon, a professor of infectious diseases at the Australian National University, believes it is a sensible tradeoff given Australia has achieved widespread Covid vaccination. He says health departments easing the rules appear to recognise that a masked, asymptomatic close contact worker poses a transmission threat that is equal to – or outweighed by – a situation in which hundreds of potentially Covid-positive travellers are standing in close proximity in a departure hall for hours on end. “It is a critical function to allow flying, so it’s not unreasonable,” Collignon says. “Crucially, the isolation rules that have been forcing the standstill at the airports can perversely increase the infection rate, as they’re causing people to line up together for hours in a poorly ventilated room.” Is it just shortages of security and airport workers that are causing the problem? No. Baggage handlers and other ground staff have also been affected by the same structural shortages and Covid issues that have hit the security workforce. At Sydney airport, wait times for baggage have ballooned, with officials acknowledging that passengers in the international terminal have had to wait up to one hour after landing for their bags to be taken off the plane and put on luggage carousels While security and airport staff shortages have been identified as the main problem affecting the queues at airports, the industry says there are other factors at play. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, was forced to clarify comments he made on Friday that passengers were “not match fit” and that those forgetting to remove laptops and aerosols from their bags at the security check are contributing to the delays. “Just to be clear, I’m not ‘blaming’ passengers,” Joyce said later. “Of course, it’s not their fault.” In his warning in late March, Sydney airport’s general manager of operations, Greg Hay, made similar comments about travellers causing delays at screening points. But shortages have plagued the aviation industry throughout the pandemic. Qantas shed thousands of staff and outsourced ground crews in a decision that was challenged in court. Unions have criticised the airline over the effect of its outsourcing and the expectations placed on fewer staff members. Pilots and aircrews are also in short supply. This week, Qantas issued an urgent plea for pilots to fly three international flights and a number of domestic flights scheduled for the coming days. The airline has also apologised to customers who have faced long wait times with its call centres trying to reorganise flights that had been cancelled.",Lifestyle/Travel,Why are there long queues at Australian airports – and what is being done to fix it?,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/13/why-are-there-long-queues-at-australian-airports-and-what-is-being-done-to-fix-it
4/13/2022,"In 2017, as Australia was debating marriage equality, Jason Om struck a chord with a very personal story. In a piece for the ABC, he wrote about his father’s 16-year struggle to accept his sexuality and how his dad eventually came to vote yes in the plebiscite. That piece is part of the basis for Om’s memoir, All Mixed Up, which is out now through ABC Books. But there is more to Om’s story than just the strained relationship between father and son. All Mixed Up also explores the life-changing secrets held by other members of his family, including Om’s late mother, who died when he was just 12. The memoir dives into the truth about his family’s past, his experience of growing up in a multi-racial, multi-faith household, and Om’s acceptance of his own “mixed-up” identity. Om – a Walkley-winning reporter with the ABC’s 7.30 – now lives in Sydney but once called Adelaide home. Back in the South Australian capital, he had an enviable collection of mid-century furniture. Only one piece, a Danish-designed armchair, made it with him in the move. Here, he tells us why he’d scramble to save that chair in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. I’m really into design and vintage furniture, mainly mid-century modern. The market is very on-trend at the moment, and there’s no shortage of replicas and knock-offs. But there’s nothing like the stunning and simple elegance of the real deal. At one point I had three couches, all bought on the cheap when I was living in South Australia while working for the ABC. A white vinyl click clack sofa cost me just 80 bucks. When I moved house in Sydney, I decided to downsize, but one treasured item I kept was my original Z-chair by Danish designer Kai Kristiansen. It has dark polished wood and beige wool with diagonal stitching. The attention to detail is unsurpassed and the design is timeless. Now, it’s in need of a little love. The arse is falling out, so I’m looking to get it repaired soon. If I had the money, I’d turn my home into the set of A Single Man with all that sexy 1960s design. When I go grocery shopping, I want to grab everything in one go and dump it in the car. So my big hessian shopping bag is indispensable. It’s actually a new bag I bought to replace an old one from the Adelaide central market. I’d forage at the market and hitch all my goodies on a bright red Vespa. That was long before the ban on single-use plastic bags, and before BYO became the norm. That bag lasted me 15 years before it got holes in it. Surprisingly, this style of hessian bag – basically a big sack with straps – was hard to find in Sydney. So I went back to the central market website and ordered it online. I can’t live without it. It’s so strong, I could even lug a large bag of potting mix I bought recently. I reckon this bag will probably be with me another 15 years. Living in Sydney, I’ve developed a fixation on mould. I can’t stand it. A while back, when I was living in a damp and dark terrace, the humidity was so bad I was pulling out absolutely drenched t-shirts from the back of my wardrobe. I’m talking sopping wet, and having to wring out the water. My collection of graphic t-shirts, which I’d built up over the years, was ruined.

4/13/2022,"Fairytales are full of horrors, as well as happiness. Too often we remember the happily ever afters and not how we got there: the beautiful woman who eludes a hitman sent by her stepmother; the girl swallowed by a wolf; the chamber full of dead women. Corpses abound in Pushing Daisies, but this fairytale TV show, as vivid as a picture book, also has plenty of heart and warmth. It tells the story of Ned (Lee Pace), a pie maker who can bring people back to life. He resurrects his murdered childhood sweetheart, Chuck (Anna Friel), and they fall in love – so far, so happily ever after. But once Ned has resurrected someone, he can’t touch them again or they will die – this time for good – so the two lovers are destined to moon over each other, sleep in separate beds and kiss through plastic wrap, never feeling each other’s touch. They must conceal their big secret: he makes the dead live and she is the living dead. Ned may be ecstatic at the unexpected reappearance of Chuck in his life, but her resurrection is not met with the same joy from others. Olive Snook (Kristin Chenoweth), a waiter in Ned’s shop The Pie Hole, is furious at Chuck’s arrival, as she is secretly in love with her boss. Emerson Cod (Chi McBride), a gruff PI who uses Ned’s gift to solve crimes, now finds he has to split his reward money three ways, with the pie maker and “the dead girl”. As Snook and Cod, Chenoweth and McBride give the show a much-needed tartness, an essential counterbalance to the sugary romance. Tart too are Chuck’s aunts Lily and Vivian (Swoosie Kurtz and Ellen Greene), two former synchronised swimming legends who are distraught after the death of their niece. Unaware she has sprung back to life, they spend their time drinking vodka, eating cheese and slinging bitter bon mots in a dimly lit, over-furnished house full of stuffed birds. Pushing Daisies is a mishmash of whodunnit, romcom, musical, farce, horror, melodrama – yet from all these familiar forms, creator Bryan Fuller made something that is not like anything else at all. And 15 years after it first aired, it still pulsates with imagination, wit and emotion. The show often looks like a picture book, with its deliberately flat CGI backdrops and boldly coloured sets in vivid reds, golden yellows and cool greens evoking a far away land – something akin to, but not quite of this world. The cast makes light work of the dialogue, which pops with rhymes, alliterative banter and double entendres; some of the saucier lines are almost lost amid the mayhem. “Olive can you close up?” Ned asks, leaving the cafe with Chuck. “I think I already did,” she replies sadly, watching the man she loves leave with another woman. Pushing Daisies received 12 Emmy nominations for its first season, and four wins for its second, but was cancelled before a third, something that has been attributed to disruptions brought about by the 2007-08 Hollywood writers’ strike. A hastily conceived and unsatisfying ending does nothing to mar the wonder of the preceding episodes. Fuller has said that he made Pushing Daisies to offer an escape from life’s bleaker aspects. “I hoped in the telling of this tale about pies and dogs and love and lost childhoods and reclaimed romance, we could find respite from what was essentially death, death, death,” he told Esquire in 2017. “We’re surrounded by death every day. If anything, it allows us to look with greater affection at the living moments rather than spending time wallowing in depression.” Pushing Daisies could easily have been all beauty and no beast – but beneath the whimsy, the starry-eyed romance and the wacky hijinks, is a touching, bittersweet story of grief, longing and betrayal.

4/13/2022,"Anthony Albanese is set to announce Labor’s first major health commitment of the election campaign: $135m to trial 50 new urgent care clinics meant to ease pressure on hospitals. The clinics will be based at GP surgeries and community health centres in at least 50 locations across the country. Labor says they will be modelled on a similar scheme operating in New Zealand. Wednesday’s announcement in Melbourne comes as Labor rolls out a series of health policies and Albanese seeks to refocus his campaign on the party’s key messages of Medicare, aged care and childcare after a rocky start to his campaign. Labor this week has also announced it will restore a 50% loading for telehealth psychiatric services for regional and urban areas at a cost of $31m and pledged a $1.5m boost to child hearing services. Strengthening Medicare and “making it easier to see a doctor” are among Labor’s key campaign messages – but the party has been saving its key health announcements for closer to polling day on 21 May. Albanese said the provision of bulk-billed urgent medical care would allow families to see a doctor without needing to visit over-burdened hospital emergency departments. “Labor’s Medicare urgent care clinics will mean more families will get top-quality care from a nurse or a doctor without having to wait in a hospital emergency department,” he said. “These clinics are a key part of Labor’s plan to strengthen Medicare by making it easier to see a doctor.” The clinics – which will be built in every state and territory – would be able to treat sprains and broken bones, cuts, wounds, insect bites, minor ear and eye problems and minor burns. They would be open seven days a week from at least 8am to 10pm which is the time when most non-life-threatening injuries occur, the opposition says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The issue of strained hospital emergency departments has become a growing problem for state governments, with ambulance ramping – when an emergency crew is unable to transfer their patients into hospital within a clinically acceptable time – becoming more prevalent as a result of surging demand. The recent South Australian election saw Labor successfully campaign on the issue of ambulance ramping, while it has also become a political issue in WA and Queensland. According to the Australian Medical Association, there is a chronic underfunding of public hospitals resulting in an “access crisis” that is the worst it has been in 30 years. “We have heard stories of people dying waiting to be seen in public hospitals that are operating at breaking point, and ambulance ramping at public hospitals because there aren’t enough beds and staff to cope with demand,” the AMA said in its pre-budget submission. In New Zealand, urgent care clinics deal with about 2.5m consultations a year, with the country having the lowest rate of emergency department attendance per capita in the developed world. According to the Royal New Zealand College of Urgent Care, New Zealand has an ED attendance rate each year of 230 for every 1,000 people, compared with 330 in Australia. Labor’s shadow health minister, Mark Butler, said the policy was a “practical, tangible” example of Labor’s commitment to strengthen Medicare and make it easier for families to access care. “Medicare is the bedrock of our health system and by using it to help take the pressure off hospital emergency departments we make can the whole system stronger,” he said.",News/Australia news,Labor to commit $135m to trial 50 urgent care clinics intended to ease pressure on hospitals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/labor-to-commit-135m-to-trial-50-urgent-care-clinics-intended-to-ease-pressure-on-hospitals
4/13/2022,"There are fears health issues in babies could be going undetected as infant and maternal health checks remain suspended in parts of Melbourne’s west due to a shortage of workers. Early childhood and maternal care experts warned the ongoing limits to the free service meant some parents were relying on blogs instead to find health information about their child’s development. The Department of Health enacted an initial six-week pause on maternal checks for babies aged over eight weeks on 28 January while a “code brown” was in place in hospitals across Victoria. The emergency measure, designed to ease pressure on hospitals caused by a surge in Covid cases, allowed the state’s health workforce to be redeployed which meant specialist nurses were unavailable to conduct the regular infant checks. Despite the code brown ending in mid-February, long-term workforce shortages and a Covid-driven baby boom have meant some councils were still unable to offer the service. Wyndham City Council is still only conducting maternal checks on babies aged under eight weeks. At Melton City Council, the service is paused for babies four months and over. Jennifer Weber, chief executive of Caroline Chisholm Society, said the ongoing pause was a “worrying” trend because maternal checks played a vital role in early screening for heath problems, providing referrals and identifying risk factors like domestic violence and postnatal depression. “This is your universal service, and it’s not operating as a universal service,” she told Guardian Australia. “How much more can this system be put under this pressure before somebody says enough is enough?” The maternal checks – a free service offered by all local councils – monitors babies’ key development factors like weight and diet and provides support and advice for parents. Weber said the service was receiving reports of parents using blogs to find out information because they were unable to see a maternal and child health nurse. “Families are reporting things like – their babies are not smiling. So then where do families go to [get] their information? “We don’t want mothers having to then go to blogs to find out: ‘Is this where my child should be in their development?’” Weber said Caroline Chisholm Society advocated for increased funding for family service organisations to partner with maternal health services to relieve some of the pressure and ensure parents and babies did not “slip into vulnerability”. She said specialised maternal health nurses – nurses who have trained as midwives and have qualifications in maternal and child health – were an ageing workforce, with code brown “exposing that risk”. “If you’ve got a child under the age of two, who has eyes on the situation with a mum and a family to get the best outcome?” she said. The pandemic has compounded nurse and midwifery shortages. In July last year, the Andrews government announced a $13.2m investment to ease pressures on the state’s maternity services, after reports of understaffed maternity wards and women giving birth in emergency rooms and corridors. But the six-month funding has now run out. Opposition health spokesperson, Georgie Crozier, a former midwife, said maternal and child health checks were critical in detecting developmental delays, feeding problems and family violence issues. “For these services not to be reinstated to some of Victoria’s most vulnerable mothers and babies is putting them at further risk,” she said. The Greens’ deputy leader and emergency services spokesperson, Ellen Sandell, called on the state government to undertake a “comprehensive” review of Victoria’s perinatal care to fix long-term workforce issues. “Women, parents and babies are not getting the quality of care they deserve at the most vulnerable time of their lives and midwives and nurses are being pushed to the brink. Victoria needs to do better,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning During the pause, Indigenous families, vulnerable children and those with additional needs are still able to access the maternal check service. The Municipal Association of Victoria, the peak body for local councils, said there were a “small number of councils” unable to resume maternal checks at full capacity. “We are currently working with the Department of Health and Safer Care Victoria on short and medium term strategies to help councils work towards full capacity,” MAV’s chief executive, Kerry Thompson, said. Wyndham City Council said it was monitoring the situation closely and ensuring families had alternative support options. Melton City Council said it was driving a recruitment campaign to attract qualified maternal and child health nurses, and urged the state government to create incentives for nurses to move into the specialisation. The government has warned the peak from the Omicron subvariant – predicted to occur this month – will result in “several hundred” extra hospitalisations each day. The state’s peak hospital body has warned it could result in worsening staff shortages and a reduction in elective surgery procedures.

4/13/2022,"Christian lobby groups are pressing both major parties to recommit to the unamended religious discrimination bill as Labor guarantees to extend the chaplaincy program with a secular choice for schools. Guardian Australia understands Labor has told FamilyVoice it has “consistently supported” the $61m a year chaplaincy program but will move to give schools the option of a secular pastoral care worker. The opposition is being pressured by Christian Schools Australia to ditch its proposed changes to the religious discrimination bill. On Tuesday Scott Morrison stopped short of recommitting to the religious bill and blamed Labor for his government’s decision not to put it to a Senate vote in February. That prompted outrage from FamilyVoice spokesman Greg Bondar, who said it was “not true” to blame Labor for “Morrison’s failure” to pass the bill, instead blaming five Liberal MPs for a deal with the attorney general to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination. In February Labor helped pass the religious discrimination bill in the lower house but, along with five Liberal MPs who crossed the floor, added amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act to protect LGBTQ+ students. Facing a revolt from conservatives who found the amendments unacceptable, the Morrison government shelved the bill, which did not pass the Senate despite bipartisan support for banning discrimination on the grounds of religion. On Tuesday Morrison incorrectly claimed the bill didn’t have bipartisan support, arguing “the Labor party used it as a Trojan horse to seek to make other changes”. “I found that very disappointing,” he said. Asked if he would commit to reintroduce and pass the bill in the next term, Morrison said his “views about protecting people against religious discrimination are well known and my credibility on those issues are not challenged or under question”. Bondar said Morrison must commit to pass the bill. He noted Labor has committed to pass a religious discrimination bill including “maintaining the right of religious schools to preference people of their faith in the selection of staff”. “Christians and faith-based groups are very disappointed at Morrison’s failure to come good with the promised bill,” he said. One Nation has recommitted to the bill, and its leader Pauline Hanson has taken aim at Morrison for “capitulating to Liberal moderates and [announcing] more protections for students who didn’t need them”. Christian Schools Australia director of public policy, Mark Spencer, said it had sought a commitment from both parties to reintroduce and pass the bill in its original form. Labor had called for a range of other amendments banning racial vilification and removing the controversial statements of belief clause. Spencer warned Labor against the “strong temptation to want to put its stamp on a piece of legislation” that had already been the subject of “extensive consultation”. Since the 2019 election, Labor has been seeking to extend an olive branch to religious communities. Labor told FamilyVoice it is “committed to give schools the option to choose either a professionally qualified secular student welfare officer or a chaplain with ongoing qualification requirements, to ensure that our students are appropriately supported”. On Saturday Guardian Australia revealed claims by a former chaplain that Schools Ministry Group, the second largest chaplaincy provider, imposes a code that discriminates against staff based on relationship status and sexual conduct. Caragh Larsen also claimed a SMG manager blamed a child’s behavioural issues on a “demonic response” to the “presence of God” that chaplains brought into a school. SMG has said it does “not endorse” the comments, which are under investigation by the South Australian education department. Nadia David, Labor’s candidate for Indi, linked to the story on Twitter, questioning “why are we paying for religious chaplains in state schools”. Why are we paying for religious chaplains in state schools?? https://t.co/p8fyk5FvB7 Independent MP Zali Steggall said there is “value in the breadth of pastoral care services provide by the chaplaincy program as a supplement to formal counselling” but schools should be allowed “more choice”. The independent candidate for Boothby, Jo Dyer, said “requiring support [to young people] to be provided by chaplains … undermines the important principle of the separation between church and state”. “I support schools being able to access the funds currently provided through the national schools chaplaincy program to buy in a range of pastoral and psychological support services.” In December, an inquiry into mental health chaired by Liberal MP Fiona Martin called for an independent evaluation of the chaplaincy program. The independent candidate for Curtin, Kate Chaney, supports that call. “It’s appropriate that we are reviewing whether wellbeing outcomes are best served through the current chaplaincy program,” she said.

4/13/2022,"The only people in Australia who can boost wage growth are employers and the only way they can do that is by giving people pay rises. The whole point of abandoning what was once called “centralised wage fixing” and deregulating the labour market over the past 30 years was to put employers in charge of deciding how much they pay their employees. And, guess what, on the whole Australian employers have decided to boost their profits rather than boost their workers’ wages. Just as Scott Morrison wants to see more women get into parliament (but not at the expense of men) and wants to see housing affordability improve (without house prices actually falling) the prime minister is all in favour of stronger wage growth – but not at the expense of higher profits. Unfortunately for Australians struggling with the rising cost of living, they can’t feed magic pudding to their kids. The share of GDP flowing to workers has declined steadily since the Coalition came to power, from 53.2% in 2013 to about 50.6%. To put that decline into context, if the wage share of GDP had remained steady since Tony Abbott came to power, Australian workers would be taking home an additional $49bn in their pay packers this year. To put that in perspective, we only spend $51bn on the entire aged pension. While it is individual businesses that are responsible for lifting their prices and profits faster than they are lifting the wages of their workers, there is no doubt they have been cheered on by the Coalition government. Indeed, soon after Tony Abbott won the 2013 election his then employment minister, Eric Abetz, having referred to employers who offered good wage rises as “weak kneed”, declared that: “Employers and unions must be encouraged to take responsibility for the cost of their deals; not just the cost to the affected enterprises but the overall cost in relation to our economy efficiency and the creation of opportunities for others. “If this is not done, then we risk seeing something akin to the wages explosion of the pre-accord era.” While Abetz was wrong about the risks of a “wage explosion” in Australia, he was right that Australian employers need to “take responsibility” for the impact of the low wages they have been offering, not just on their workers but on the economy as a whole. As both the Reserve Bank of Australia and Treasury have made clear, Australia’s low wage growth is a major drag on the economy. The tens of billions of dollars that have been kept from Australian workers have obviously not been spent in local shops, haven’t created local jobs and, in turn, have made it harder for some businesses to offer higher wages. National wage growth is not some abstract concept like “consumer sentiment” or an arbitrary, self-imposed speed limit like “23.9%” – the Coalition’s magic number to suppress the tax-to-GDP ratio. Annual wage growth is simply the average rate of wage increases paid by Australia’s 2.4m employers. Just as Australia’s rainfall would be above average this year if every town had more rain than usual, the only way to boost Australia’s wage growth is for employers to offer bigger pay rises than they did last year. While there is no doubt wage growth and the wage share of national income are at all-time lows, there is also no doubt that Scott Morrison is about to blame either employers or his government for the problem. Which means the only people left to blame are workers – a bit like blaming starving people for not eating enough. Earlier this year the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, argued that “switching jobs allows workers to move up the job ladder for better pay”. While this may be sometimes true for a tiny minority, it is erring on the side of delusional for most of Australia’s 13.3 million workers looking for a pay rise. It is true that workers have a role to play in demanding higher pay, but it is also true that three successive governments have worked tirelessly to discourage, and even criminalise, employees working together to negotiate wage rises and go on strike if they fail. Likewise, as the largest employer in Australia, the commonwealth government has relied heavily on pay freezes for public servants. Needless to say, if the biggest employer in Australia freezes pay then average wage growth has to fall. Again, it’s not that complicated. In the great “whodunnit” of low wage growth in Australia, big business lobby groups are quick to provide their alibis for why they can’t give their workers a pay rise. But while everyone seems to have an excuse, the evidence is clear: corporate profits are up 20% through the pandemic, the first time in Australian history where profits have increased, far outstripping wages. Low wage growth in Australia didn’t happen by accident. It’s the system working as intended. The only question is whether politicians will keep blaming workers for their lack of bargaining power – or start trying to fix it. Dr Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute, an independent thinktank based in Canberra.

4/13/2022,"Australia’s new gas export developments are likely to struggle economically after 2030 if the world lives up to commitments to combat the climate crisis, according to a warning to major investors. It suggests Australia’s liquified natural gas (LNG) exports could fall slightly this decade before dropping sharply to less than 20% of current levels by 2050 if the world attempts to limit global heating to 1.5C, as agreed under last year’s Glasgow climate pact. The analysis by the Investor Group on Climate Change, a body that represents major institutional investors that manage more than $33tr in global assets, questions the viability of eight major fossil fuel developments that are yet to begin production and are scheduled to run until after 2050. They include Woodside’s $16bn Scarborough project in Western Australia, Origin Energy’s plan to start extraction in the Northern Territory’s Beetaloo Basin and Santos’ greenfield gas development at Narrabri in New South Wales. The analysis has been released shortly before Woodside and Santos hold annual general meetings at which shareholders will vote on the companies’ climate plans. Using modelling commissioned from global energy consultants Wood MacKenzie, the analysis found demand for gas exports was more likely to fall much more rapidly than gas use within Australia. About three-quarters of gas extracted in Australia is exported. The industry has grown dramatically over the past decade, and last year shipped 81m tonnes, valued at $50bn. But the investor group said its research showed new developments could to be economically challenged under scenarios consistent with 1.5C of heating, and investors were likely to be cautious about supporting capital expenditure, particularly for projects that were scheduled to run past the 2040s. Rebecca Mikula-Wright, the group’s chief executive, said investors would be concerned that the modelling indicated new gas developments would face “a range of complex and interconnected risks”. “Investors want to understand how Australian gas companies are assessing the risks associated with new projects, in particular the risk of accelerated demand decline as the world shifts to net zero,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “As a country, we need to be part of a net zero emissions future by embracing a transition that is efficient, economically sensible and favours renewable energy sources over fossil fuels.” The modelling turns on the assumption that governments and investors will accelerate climate policies with an aim to limit heating to 1.5C. The world’s most respected climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), last week suggested that goal was slipping out of reach. Gas is often described as having half the greenhouse gas emissions of coal when burned, though studies have found its impact on the climate is greater than this due to leaks of methane – a short-lived but highly potent greenhouse gas – during extraction and transport. The gas industry lobby group, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, argues demand for the fuel will remain strong as the world cuts emissions, in part due to carbon capture and storage (CCS). Australian government’s have committed more than $4bn to developing CCS – capturing emissions and storing them underground – but it is yet to prove economically viable at scale. Speaking last week, the association’s outgoing chief executive, Andrew McConville, said: “Gas will continue to be a part of the future cleaner energy mix as a cleaner alternative that complements so many of the pathways to net zero by 2050.” The gas industry is strongly supported by the Morrison government, which committed nearly $1bn of public support as part of what it calls a “gas-fired recovery”. Labor has not opposed support for gas industry expansion. The investor group cited a recent report by the IPCC, which found gas use contributed to dangerous emissions levels and that global carbon pollution needed to peak by 2025 and be cut nearly in half by 2030 to keep alive a chance of limiting heating to 1.5C. The analysis considered the impact of eight developments proposed by the energy companies Woodside, Santos, Origin and OilSearch that are scheduled to start production before the end of the decade, and projected demand for gas across Asia and Australia. Depending on the path taken to try to limit global heating to 1.5C – principally, how quickly Australia embraces long-duration storage to back-up renewable energy – it found domestic use of gas would fall by either 50% or 13% by mid-century. But it found LNG exports would fall dramatically after 2030 whether the world took an accelerated or more gradual path in cutting emissions. Projects that cost more and were harder to access geographically were likely to come under the greatest pressure.",News/Environment,"Australia’s new gas projects to struggle financially after 2030 if 1.5C climate goal met, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/13/australias-new-gas-projects-to-struggle-financially-after-2030-if-15c-climate-goal-met-report-says
4/13/2022,"Australia’s official jobless rate could drop below 4% as soon as Thursday, market economists predict, as labour shortages force some restaurants to limit services, and recruiters dangle hefty pay increases to lure talent. The nation’s unemployment rate will sink as low as 3.8% when the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports labour data for March, economists say. That would be the lowest rate since 1974. While Labor leader Anthony Albanese stumbled earlier this week to say the latest jobless rate sat at 4%, the precise figure (for statistical nerds) was 4.042%. Since the ABS started releasing monthly jobs data, the rate has only been below 4% once, in February 2008, when it was 3.981%. The consensus of forecasts is for the March unemployment rate to come in at 3.9%. ANZ has the lowest estimate among the big four banks, predicting the tally to come in at 3.8%, with the economy adding 50,000 jobs for the month. Hiring signs have become increasingly common in shop windows around the country. However, employers such as Sydney Restaurant Group said it was a battle to secure staff even at higher wages. “We’re short everywhere but finding good chefs is a very, very difficult task, as it is for all front-of-house people,” the group owner, Bill Drakopoulos, said. “Every position is hard to fill.” On some days his company, which operates 15 venues mostly in the Sydney region, has been forced to limit the number of patrons it can serve. At other times, it has cut the 14 lunch and dinner standard shifts across the week to 10. “The demand is certainly there,” he said. “It’s the … shortage of staff that is hurting us.” Tim Nieuwenhuis, the managing director of Workfast Australia, a recruiter for industries ranging from construction to mining, said firms were “screaming for workers”. “Most government projects are recruiting people as fast as possible,” Nieuwenhuis said. “We’re flying [new recruits] all over the country”. Skilled staff who might have snared a salary of $100,000 a year before the pandemic were now asking for, and getting, as much as 40% more. Nor had the federal election triggered any hiring pause. “Australian governments, either way, they love infrastructure no matter which party wins,” he said. Alexi Boyd, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, said finding workers “is still essentially the No 1 issue” for her group’s members. “It’s stifling growth, it’s stifling their ability to innovate,” Boyd said. The halt of international students and migrants during the Covid pandemic was one reason for the shortage, with conditions only slowly improving. The lack of affordable accommodation in many regional areas also meant it was hard to house staff, she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Smaller firms were also less able to free up staff and time to train newcomers. Cafe owners, for instance, who might have been semi or fully retired, have had to return to their shops to serve as baristas or take on other roles to keep the doors open, Boyd said. Many shopping centres, such as Elizabeth Street in Brisbane’s CBD, were littered with empty stores, a trend we could see more of if staff shortages persist. “We need to open the pressure valves, otherwise we’ll see more of those shops close,” she said. Customers were starting to check ahead to see if a business is still open: “It’s become part of the psychology.” However, business confidence seems yet to be dimmed by the challenges of filling jobs, at least according to the monthly survey released on Tuesday by NAB. Business conditions, for instance, rose 9 points last month to be +18, the largest one-month jump since June 2020.

4/13/2022,"New South Wales Liberal senator Hollie Hughes justified claiming a taxpayer-funded travel allowance for Melbourne Cup day by saying the alcohol company that gave her a spot in its marquee had employees in her home state, making her attendance parliamentary business. Hughes billed taxpayers for a short trip to Melbourne in 2019, during which Victorian brewery Furphy, owned by alcohol giant Lion, treated her to an $800 spot in its Flemington marquee on Melbourne Cup day. The NSW senator had no other official engagements that day in Melbourne, but did have meetings and media engagements in Melbourne either side of race day, which justified the trip and her expense claim as predominantly for parliamentary business. Freedom of information documents show that the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority began investigating Hughes’s expense claims after reporting in the Guardian. She was asked to explain why she claimed the travel allowance, which was about $392 for the day of the Melbourne Cup. Hughes told the watchdog that Furphy was associated with Tooheys, also a Lion brand, which was a “major employer in my state”. “I was hosted as a Senator for NSW by Furphys at the Melbourne Cup, owners of Tooheys. A major employer in my state of NSW,” she wrote to Ipea. Hughes told the watchdog she had visited one of the company’s factories at a later date, which was “an extension of the working relationship with the organisation”. “This [the relationship] included working with them throughout the Covid lockdown and the NSW State Government to avoid the factory closure during lockdown,” she wrote. Furphy is a Geelong brewery. Ipea accepted the explanation and said the case warranted no further investigation. But it also told the senator that she would need to be prepared to publicly justify her claim. “IPEA further notes that while such an event might appear to have personal benefit to some in the Australian community, in the principles-based scheme it is the responsibility of the parliamentarian to be prepared to publicly justify for their use of public resources for conduction [sic] their parliamentary business,” the watchdog wrote. The Guardian asked Hughes whether she stood by her claim that her attendance was linked to her parliamentary work because Lion had employees in her state. On Friday, her office asked for more time to respond due to the fact the senator was “currently very ill with Covid”. She appeared for an in-person interview with Sky News at the channel’s Sydney studio two days later, on 10 April. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW Covid rules require positive cases to isolate for seven days.

The senator then finished her isolation the day prior to the Sky News interview, and returned a negative rapid test on the day of the interview. “Senator Hughes tested positive for Covid on Saturday 2 April. She isolated at home from 2 April to 9 April and had a negative RAT on Sunday 10 April,” the spokesperson said. “Senator Hughes did not have a sore throat, runny nose, cough or shortness of breath in the last 24 hours of her isolation period.” The spokesperson did not respond to further questions about the Melbourne Cup travel allowance claim.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberal senator billed taxpayers for travel allowance on day of Melbourne Cup marquee event,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/13/nsw-liberal-senator-billed-taxpayers-for-travel-allowance-on-day-of-melbourne-cup-marquee-event
4/13/2022,"The Greens will announce on Wednesday a $7.5bn a year policy to include dental into Medicare, which the party says will be a key priority if it holds the balance of power. Speaking at the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Greens leader Adam Bandt will announce that the policy could be funded by billionaires and large corporations paying their “fair share of tax”. He will also say the party is “on track” to hold balance of power in the House of Representatives and noted that the party had already successfully negotiated dental services for children in a deal during the formation of Julia Gillard’s minority government in 2010. “Last time the Greens were in the balance of power we got dental into Medicare for kids, and now we’ll finish the job by getting dental into Medicare for everyone,” Bandt will say. “In balance of power, the Greens will kick the Liberals out and take climate action by stopping new coal and gas mines, and we’ll tackle the cost of living by getting dental and mental health into Medicare, fixing the housing affordability crisis and wiping student debt.” Bandt will claim the policy, which parliamentary budget office costings show would cost about $7.5bn a year, could be funded by its proposed 6% extra tax on billionaires and a corporate “super profits tax”. “The money is there to pay for these plans if we have the guts to take on the billionaires and big corporations,” Bandt says. “Labor agrees with Liberals that workers should get a one-off payment of $420 but billionaires should get a tax cut of $9,000 a year, every year, for ever, but the Greens want something different.” “The Greens will make Clive Palmer pay more tax so you can fix your teeth.” Under the policy, everyone entitled to Medicare would be able to access Medicare-funded dental care and orthodontic treatment as well as oral surgeries, periodontics and prosthodontics. The proposal would also expand the child dental benefits scheme (CDBS) to provide eligible recipients with unlimited routine and therapeutic dental care, including orthodontics, and allow health care card holders to be bulk-billed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning PBO costings, released by the party, show the $7bn annual cost estimate is based on the assumption that about 80% of dental care services would be routine dental care, which consists of low-to-medium cost dental care services, and that there would be sufficient qualified dentists and dental care workers for the significantly increased demand for services. The PBO document states that it does not examine whether the supply of qualified dentists and health care workers is sufficient for the forecast increased demand of dental care services, nor the impact to private health care premiums, insurance rebates and the viability of private providers, who would be required to bulk bill. The annual cost is about $7.5bn a year over the forward estimates, growing to about $10bn a year over the medium term, with a 10-year cost of $77bn.",News/Australia news,Billionaire tax to fund Greens’ $7.5bn plan for Medicare to cover dental,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/billionaire-tax-to-fund-greens-75bn-plan-for-medicare-to-cover-dental
4/13/2022,"Thousands of Etsy sellers are shutting up shop this week to protest against a rise in fees made by the online marketplace for independent artists, vintage sellers and craftspeople. The move is a response to Etsy, which hosts more than 5.3m businesses, from Monday increasing the fees it charges sellers from 5% to 6.5% – a 30% increase. More than 20,000 Etsy sellers have joined the strike after organising via Reddit, with many putting their online shops in to “vacation mode” for the whole week and some just for Monday. Other Etsy vendors are keeping their stores open but have added imagery explaining their opposition to the fee hike to customers. In a letter sent on Monday to Etsy’s chief executive, Josh Silverman, the strike organiser, Kristi Cassidy from Rhode Island, called the move “nothing short of pandemic profiteering”. Etsy has yet to respond. Speaking to the Guardian, Cassidy said: “We gave people multiple options for how to participate, depending on their financial situation.” Cassidy said more than 22,500 Etsy sellers had joined the protest. As well as anger about the increased fees, Etsy vendors are also opposing other changes, which they argue have cheapened the brand and eaten into their profits. Sellers with an Etsy turnover of more than $10,000 a year are charged an extra mandatory 12% fee for offsite marketing. Noemie Kenyon, a British seller, said: “I’m unhappy about the forced marketing – or what they call ‘offsite ads’. I find that quite outrageous as the seller doesn’t have a say on what will be advertised.” As well as asking for the fee increase to be cancelled, the strike organisers want sellers to be able to opt out of offsite ads. Etsy dropped its B-corp certification – a US legal designation under which companies undertake to maintain certain standards relating to employee benefits, charitable giving and supply chain practices – in 2017 and went on to report record profits in 2020 and 2021. Etsy did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment. A spokesperson told Marketwatch: “Sellers have consistently told us they want us to expand our efforts around marketing, customer support and removing listings that don’t meet our policies. Our revised fee structure will enable us to increase our investments in each of these key areas so we can better serve our community and keep Etsy a beloved, trusted and thriving marketplace.” In a blog to Etsy sellers published before the strike, Cassidy wrote: “As individual crafters, makers and small businesspeople, we may be easy for a giant corporation like Etsy to take advantage of. But as an organised front of people, determined to use our diverse skills and boundless creativity to win ourselves a fairer deal, Etsy won’t have such an easy time shoving us around.” After Amazon workers’ historic win last week in establishing its first union in Staten Island, New York City, Cassidy said she believed this could be the start of a new labour movement for the gig economy. “That’s what we wanted to do from the beginning,” she said, adding that more than 500 sellers had committed to work together to grow an Etsy activist campaign.",News/Technology,Thousands of Etsy sellers to strike over rising transaction fees,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/12/thousands-etsy-sellers-strike-fees-online-shops
