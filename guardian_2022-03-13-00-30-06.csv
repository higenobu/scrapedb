3/13/2022,"You might have heard the song Heat Waves, by Glass Animals, or maybe you haven’t. It was a UK hit, but not ubiquitous, not the kind of song you would necessarily expect to break international records. It was first released in June 2020. Last October, it peaked at number five. Glass Animals were on their way to becoming an indie-pop staple. In 2017, they were nominated for the Mercury prize, for their second album. But in the US, they have become a pop staple and there is no more indie about it. It took 59 weeks for Heat Waves to make the journey from its arrival at number 100 in the Billboard charts to its spot at the very top and now, after more than a year, Glass Animals have a number one hit in America. It is the slowest ascent to the top of all time and a sign of how unpredictable a hit can be right now. Star-making songs come from all sides and they come from all eras; it is increasingly difficult to work out where, when or why it will happen. Take Pavement and their album Terror Twilight, which came out in 1999. I bought it on CD at the time. The band’s biggest song on Spotify, with 68m plays, is a B-side from that era called Harness Your Hopes, which would have been one for the mega-fans, even then. A report on Stereogum, in 2020, dug into the algorithms to suggest reasons why that particular song floated to the top, but more than 20 years later, it’s so popular that the band last week released a brand new video for it, starring one of the actors from the hit series Yellowjackets. It is thrilling, in a way, almost lawless. It’s as if a toddler has been left in charge of the music industry and is pressing the buttons at random: why not let TikTok turn Fleetwood Mac’s Dreams into one of the biggest hits of the 2020s, even though it was first released six decades ago? At the same time, any world-conquering hit is usually a surprise. It’s unpredictable by nature. What labels think will work is rarely in line with what listeners decide has worked. That’s why artists are always asked if they saw a megahit coming and they always say they did not. Mark Ronson always says that, for a long time, he didn’t think Uptown Funk was working at all. Camila Cabello said she had to persuade her label to release the mega-hit Havana. It makes sense that few could have seen Heat Waves coming. That’s part of the story of a smash. Sitting at the centre of a gaudy Venn diagram where celebrity gossip and sketch comedy meet is Pete Davidson, the Saturday Night Live regular who is also known for being a boyfriend to very famous women. Davidson, who was once engaged to Ariana Grande and who now goes out with the freshly divorced Kim Kardashian, has been a staple of the gossip circuit in recent weeks, after Kanye West, Kardashian’s ex-husband, depicted an avatar of Davidson being buried alive and then slapped by a skinned monkey, in two music videos for the same song. So last week’s report in Deadline that Davidson is to star in a new comedy inspired by his own life, certainly sounds as if it has potential. The show, provisionally entitled Bupkis, is in development but has been compared to Curb Your Enthusiasm, which is a bit like me standing in front of the mirror in my pyjamas thinking about getting dressed and then comparing myself to a catwalk model in full couture. The report says it is a “fictionalised” version of his life, but, considering the twists and turns of just the past fortnight, surely the issue isn’t what to make up, but what on earth he’s going to leave out. Anew YouGov survey, published on International Women’s Day, has revealed that, when it comes to naming female artists, British people are not necessarily at their best. Turn them upside down and shake them like a piggy bank and 30% can name three, with Tracey Emin, Barbara Hepworth and Frida Kahlo the most common artists to know. More than half of respondents said they had never been taught about female artists at school. Usually, hope lies in young people when it comes to addressing historically sexist imbalances, but not according to this survey: 84% of 18- to 24-year-olds were not up to the task. The survey was commissioned by the art historian Katy Hessel to promote her forthcoming book, The Story of Art Without Men. As an avid watcher of quiz shows on television, these results did not surprise me. From quizzes I have learned many things, namely that Tipping Point reliably gives the best wrong answers in the game (see the contestant who answered a question about which MP had written a weight-loss memoir with “Agatha Christie”). But what is true across the board, from University Challenge to Pointless to The Chase, is that questions about female artists strike fear into the hearts of every contestant. Either they answer a question that doesn’t specify the gender of the artist with a man’s name or their faces drop as they realise they should have used that extra hour they spent revising the periodic table to read up on Sarah Lucas or Vanessa Bell. Hessel is custodian of the excellent Great Women Artists Instagram page, which is the perfect place to start, for anyone who would like to brush up.

3/13/2022,"Popular restaurant chains which stopped taking cash during the pandemic have turned their backs on it long-term in the latest sign of Britain’s shift towards going cash-free. Prezzo, Itsu and Côte Brasserie are on a growing list of restaurants that have gone card-only for good, citing reduced costs, quicker customer service and claims of improved hygiene. Many branches of Starbucks and Burger King are also accepting card payments only, while Pizza Hut says it has decided to continue cashless “for the foreseeable future”. The businesses were among thousands across the UK that stopped taking coins and notes when Covid-19 first spread. Restrictions have now eased, and research has found the risk of transmission from handling cash to be low – yet many shops and restaurants are still refusing to take it. While Starbucks has not formally announced a cash ban, branches in Cambridge, Grimsby, Northumberland and London are among those accepting only card payments two years after the pandemic began. The chain said its stores had “gradually reintroduced cash” over the past year, but that “this may however vary from store to store”, as decisions lie with individual licensees. Janette Foggo, 67, a support worker from Glasgow, said she was forced to leave Burger King after finding cash wasn’t accepted. “Just so you know, not accepting cash impacts so many people in support situations who don’t use cards,” she tweeted. Another customer wrote that her six-year-old daughter was “very sad” after being unable to spend her pocket money at a card-only store. Prezzo, one of the chains to formally announce its move to cashless, said this made things “much simpler and quicker” for staff and customers at its 151 Italian restaurants. Meanwhile Côte Brasserie, a French-inspired chain which has 80-plus outlets, said it decided to go permanently cash-free because of reduced local banking facilities” and for the “safety of its teams”. And Itsu, the Asian-inspired chain with 73 stores, said being cashless lets it serve customers “safely and more quickly”, “with no distraction on cash handling policies”. Many independent businesses have also taken the step of going cash-free, particularly in city centres, according to analysts. Other chains still take cash but say they “encourage” card payments, including Caffè Nero, Pizza Express and Greggs. Nando’s, the chicken chain with more than 450 branches, opened its first cashless restaurant in Liverpool in December. It still takes cash at the others but a spokesman said that “could very well change in the future”. Adrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, which represents the banking and finance industry, said there had been a “long-running trend away from cash even before the pandemic”. In 2008, about 60% payments were in cash, and by 2020, that figure was 17%. The picture is not black and white, however, with many businesses that dropped cash during the pandemic now readopting it. Caffè Nero has returned to cash, and Costa, McDonald’s and JD Wetherspoon still offer a choice of payment options. A spokesperson for Wetherspoons said lots of customers still liked to use cash, adding: “Turning down people who turn up with legal tender is controversial.” Many retailers, the consumer group, including Aldi, Asda, Co-Op, John Lewis, Lloyds Pharmacy and Waitrose, have also pledged to continue accepting cash following a campaign by Which? The growing number of businesses moving to card-only payment has led to calls from some to protect payment choice. In the US, cities including New York and San Francisco have banned businesses from refusing cash. Charities including Age UK say failing to ensure its continued use risked freezing out the most vulnerable. Richard Kramer, chief executive of the disability charity Sense, said many would be lost without it: “If, for example, you are living with a learning disability you may only understand cash and not own a debit card. If you have a visual impairment you may struggle to use a card reader.” About 1.2 million UK adults do not have a bank account and rely solely on cash, according to the Financial Conduct Authority. Ron Delnevo, a spokesman for the UK Cash Supply Alliance, called for “payment choice” and claimed that a full move towards a cashless society could give payment companies a monopoly, enabling them to hike up their fees. He added that many people simply enjoyed using cash, with more than 40 million using it more than once a month in the UK. “Some businesses are saying now, for our sake, we’re not accepting cash,” he said. “What about the public?”",Lifestyle/Money,Cash’s reign fades as Covid accelerates high street switch to card-only,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/cashs-reign-fades-as-covid-accelerates-high-street-switch-to-card-only
3/13/2022,"The power of Sebastian Meise’s subdued prison drama comes not from big, brash moments but from subtle details. Sound design that hints at the aching emptiness outside the frame and beyond the walls. A bruised light, which gives everything and everyone a half-dead pallor. And Franz Rogowski’s remarkable, contained performance as Hans Hoffman, a gay man who spends much of his life in prison, persecuted for his sexuality in accordance with paragraph 175 of the German penal code. Time ceases to have the same meaning behind bars, but thanks to a striking physical transformation, Rogowski guides us through a nonlinear storyline spanning 1945 – Hans is released from a concentration camp only to be imprisoned immediately for the crime of his homosexuality – to 1969 and the repeal of paragraph 175. Hans’s incarcerations repeatedly reunite him with Viktor (Georg Friedrich), a one-time cellmate whose initial hostility evolves into something deeper.

3/13/2022,"Three points forward; back to a three-point gap. And on goes the world’s premier staring contest. Blinking is strictly prohibited. The focus was on Mohamed Salah after his agent, Ramy Abbas Issa, responded to Jürgen Klopp’s comments about a contract extension in a very 2022 manner by posting seven laughing emojis. But the Egyptian did not seem distracted as his emphatic second-half penalty sealed an eighth straight league victory. And Luis Díaz once again showed why, should the worst happen, life can go on. The speed of his adjustment to the Premier League has been remarkable; to say he has hit the ground running would be like describing Usain Bolt as a jogger. On his first league appearance away from Anfield, Díaz flicked, kicked, twisted and spun to the ground. Each time he got up, including after he nodded Liverpool ahead by bravely beating Robert Sánchez to the ball. Brighton are demob unhappy. They are neither upwardly or downwardly mobile this season, with this – their fifth straight defeat – making for their worst Premier League run. Home discomfort has seen them win just one in 11 but, while boos once again rang out at full-time, they were aimed at referee Mike Dean. Really though, they were born from frustration. If anything, the hosts should have been a man down. With Liverpool competing for multiple trophies, Klopp is having to manage his side like a rotisserie, turning his squad carefully to ensure just the right level of “done”. One change from last weekend’s laboured victory over West Ham saw the February player of the month, Joël Matip, return. Not only is Matip’s defending assured, his mazy runs have become a trademark. Few defenders in the division operate so well in the final third, and with his – and virtually Liverpool’s – first venture forward came the opener. Spotting Díaz’s diagonal run from left to right, Sánchez was a second late and left his opponent strewn. The celebrations were initially muted, a red card mooted. VAR suggested Dean simply chat to Sánchez; a punishment not befitting the crime. Unable to celebrate by pointing skywards in honour of his late grandmother as is the norm, Díaz had to make do with a warm embrace from Klopp. That shook Liverpool out of a slumber. Salah flashed a volley over before forcing a save from Sánchez after whizzing up the field on a break. He nearly scored when a deflection off of Lewis Dunk’s calf hit the bar and should have done better when he dragged wide after a Díaz surge. But when Sadio Mané fired a volley against Yves Bissouma’s flung out hand, Salah converted from the spot to score his 20th Premier League goal of the season and Liverpool’s 2,000th in the competition. Until going behind, Brighton were brave, buzzing around in the yellow and blue strip they wore to show solidarity with Ukraine. There was even the rare sight of Fabinho looking slightly exposed by the neat triangles around him. Neal Maupay flashed an early 20-yarder at a scrambling Alisson but the goal left them flat. Leandro Trossard’s head was rightly in his hands after going nowhere near with a chance to level within a minute of the restart, but Alisson’s 15th clean sheet of the season was not in question until he tipped a late Danny Welbeck flick over. Sadly, Adam Lallana’s introduction as a half-time substitute against his former club lasted all of five minutes. Klopp, who previously described him as a club legend, showed concern. For the Brighton manager, Graham Potter, a past issue that had for a time appeared resolved has reared its head again: possession – of which they have usually have plenty – might make a sizeable chunk of the law, but offers little if not accompanied by goals. With one in five, those have dried up. Next for Liverpool is their game in hand: a trip to Arsenal, whose soft underbelly has been replaced by snarl and bite. But greatness will not be thrust upon Klopp’s men; they must achieve it.",Sport/Football,Díaz and Salah on target as Liverpool beat Brighton to stay in title hunt,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/brighton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
3/13/2022,"The Covid pandemic has made families “more relaxed” about their children staying home or going on unauthorised holidays, fracturing the social contract between parents and schools in England, according to the head of Ofsted. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s chief inspector, said she was concerned about the high level of absences among pupils, telling the Association of School and College Leaders annual conference: “Some parents have health concerns for themselves or family members and wait in hope for a highly unlikely zero-Covid future. “Others, having seen that remote education is possible, have a more relaxed attitude to absence, whether long-term or to enable family holidays in term time. They have seen that other people’s children are away from school and so expect the same latitude. “Families whose children have special educational needs struggled more than most when regular support services were curtailed. Some of those children found comfort in learning at home, going at their own pace. So it’s understandable that some parents are reluctant now to let that go.” The pandemic and lockdowns has also “exacerbated” existing problems for children who were persistently absent from school, often among parents who were struggling financially or because of domestic violence or substance abuse. “The disruption we’ve seen over the last two years has fractured the social contract around education … Now’s the time to remake that contract,” she said. Spielman told the conference in Birmingham she was also concerned by increases in children in England being educated at home, and said she supported the government’s plans for a register of children being home-schooled. “We take a very liberal attitude to home education in this country, compared to many other nations. “We need to recognise that home education is very hard. Most parents aren’t equipped to do it and if they are motivated by their own or their child’s anxiety, rather than a deeply held desire to home-educate, the outcomes for their child are unlikely to be great,” she said. Referring to the abuse and murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, Spielman said: “And we should also remember that sadly a small number of parents have darker motivations for taking their children away from their teacher’s sight.” The conference of head teachers also heard Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary, attack the government’s handling of education in England during the pandemic. “When clear, focused government leadership was needed in response to the pandemic there was a vacuum. No plan, no direction. No ambition,” Phillipson said. “Children who joined reception classes in September will have lived more than half their lives under the pandemic. “In many cases, they have not had the chance to explore, socialise, develop vital skills, in nurseries or playgroups, all of which will matter right throughout school, and right throughout their lives.” Phillipson said a future Labour government would look closely at Ofsted’s role in school improvement, noting that while Ofsted is officially 30 years old, the schools it inspects are now very different. “Yet Ofsted still operates in a way that is often too high stakes, and where the risks of a bad inspection outweigh the rewards of a good one. “A cat and mouse game between inspectors and schools, with no incentive to have an honest professional dialogue, to accept weakness and work to address it, are the unhelpful features of such an adversarial system,” Phillipson said, arguing that “change needs to happen”.",News/Education,Covid made parents ‘more relaxed’ about unauthorised holidays – Ofsted,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/12/covid-made-parents-more-relaxed-about-unauthorised-holidays-ofsted
3/13/2022,"One of two Republicans on the House January 6 committee has said he regrets his vote against the first impeachment of Donald Trump, for withholding military aid to Ukraine in an attempt to obtain dirt on rivals including Joe Biden. In tweets posted on Friday, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued, with cities besieged and bombarded, Adam Kinzinger said: “I want to be honest, in Congress I have only a few votes that in hinds[igh]t, I regret. My biggest regret was voting against the first impeachment of Donald Trump. “It’s important for political leaders to be transparent and admit regret when needed. The bottom line, Donald Trump withheld lethal aid to Ukraine so he could use it as leverage for his campaign. This is a shameful and illegal act, directly hurting the Ukraine defense today. “I wish I could go back in time and vote for it, but I cannot. What we can do now is to ensure that this never happens again, and that we all put the interests of our nation above our party. Alexander Vindman [a White House official who was fired for opposing Trump’s Ukraine scheme] and others deserve our appreciation.” No House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the Ukraine scandal, which saw only the Utah senator Mitt Romney vote to convict in the Senate. Kinzinger, from Illinois, was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him for inciting the deadly Capitol attack. Kinzinger is also among such Republicans who have announced that they will retire at the next election, rather than face a Trump-anointed challenger. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the other Republican on the January 6 committee, faces such a primary challenge. She also voted not to impeach Trump over Ukraine but to impeach him over the Capitol riot. Trump is in legal jeopardy over January 6, his attempts to overturn the election and his business affairs. But he still dominates the Republican party and polling of possible presidential nominees in 2024. He has hinted heavily and repeatedly that he will indeed run. In response to Kinzinger’s tweets, Edward Luce of the Financial Times said he “want[ed] to hear more as it can’t be that you were ignorant of the facts or of the nature of Trump”. Luce added: “It’s always admirable to admit mistakes … it would be an even greater service to hear about the psychology of such politics as most of his colleagues are still acting that way.” Kinzinger did not immediately elaborate. His party remains home to politicians who have praised Vladimir Putin, not least Trump himself. The former president has repeatedly praised the Russian president for being smart, though he has condemned the Ukraine war. On Thursday night, Trump repeatedly rebuffed attempts by the Fox News host Sean Hannity to get him to say Putin was “evil” or an “enemy”. Another House Republican, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, a prominent Trump supporter, was reported this week to have called the president of Ukraine, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, a “thug” and his government “incredibly evil”. On Twitter, Kinzinger said: “This is the sad but successful impact of Russia’s cyber operation that we’ve seen pushed and promoted on conservative outlets. The threat is real and it’s dangerous. Case in point: a sitting US congressman is echoing Putin propaganda.”",News/US news,Republican Kinzinger: I should have voted to impeach Trump over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/kinzinger-republican-impeach-trump-ukraine-putin-madison-cawthorn
