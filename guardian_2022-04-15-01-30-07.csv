4/15/2022,"Some of Rio’s most cherished street carnival groups say they are fighting for the right to party ahead of the city’s first official celebrations since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Rio’s world-famous samba schools will return to action next week for their first parades at the Sambódromo stadium in more than two years. But the carnival enthusiasts behind hundreds of “blocos” – riotous musical troupes that roam the streets clutching brass instruments and booze – are furious they have not received authorization to gather. The Omicron variant scuppered plans for this year’s pre-lenten carnival, which should have been held in late February. But while the Sambódromo competition was rearranged for next weekend – and often expensive private shindigs are also taking place – authorities claim there was insufficient time to prepare for the free outdoor blocos, which attract hundreds of thousands of partygoers. More than 120 blocos denounced their sidelining this week in a manifesto that declared: “The streets belong to the people and we are free to speak.” “Revelers unite!” urged the pronouncement, whose signatories included groups such as the Soggy Capybaras and the Bellicose Knickers. Hundreds of glitter-smeared carnival activists pranced through downtown Rio on Wednesday night to protest what they called a hammer-blow to the local economy and one of Brazil’s most important cultural treasures. “The city hall has abandoned street carnival,” complained Kiko Horta, a founder of one of Rio’s best-known blocos, the Cordão do Boitatá. “It makes no sense. Street carnival – along with the [Sambódromo] carnival – is the city’s most important festival. It has tremendous symbolic, cultural and economic value. Simply forbidding it is absurd,” Horta added. Telma Neves, the president of the samba bloco Engata no Centro (City Centre Coupling), joined the demo with her 83-year-old mother Georgina who had not missed a carnival since she was six. “We’ve spent the last two years in silence, unable to do anything,” Neves, 58, complained. “We’re pleading for the right to our own carnival.” Wednesday’s rally offered a snapshot of the weird and wonderful world of Rio street carnival, as bacchanals of all ages and from all walks of life danced through town wearing a dizzying medley of costumes – or in some cases almost no clothes at all. One man came dressed as a grim reaper brandishing a Minion toy and a pretend syringe – a political critique of president Jair Bolsonaro’s denialist response to Covid. Other performers sambaed on wooden stilts or carried the flags of their racily named blocos including Bésame Mucho (Cover me with Kisses) and the Bloco das Trepadeiras (Botanical Bonking). Claudio Manhães, a 43-year-old x-ray technician, came to represent his group – founded by a gang of samba-loving radiology professionals and called Te Vejo Por Dentro, or I Can See Your Insides. “We thought this year’s carnival would be a super carnival like in 1919 after the Spanish flu,” Manhães said, showing off photographs of the green T-shirts his bloco had printed for a party that would no longer take place. “It’s sad. There were so many expectations,” Manhães sighed. “Revelers wanted that moment of joy – and even more so than usual because of the Covid pandemic.” Dhel Aquino, the founder of Dhel e os Cabras da Peste, a bloco that mixes samba with north-eastern rhythms like frevo and baião, said the government’s failure to support Rio’s free, open-air carnival undermined the democratic nature of debauchery. “Our carnival is participative … a place where you can have fun if you’ve got money and have fun if you don’t,” said the Amazon-born journalist who remembered falling in love with carnival when he moved to Rio with his family as a child. “I live carnival and I breathe carnival. I spend the whole year thinking about carnival,” Aquino enthused before donning a red clown’s nose and joining the jamboree. “It represents freedom. It represents being able to forget about your daily life, your problems, your demands and your worries.” Tarcísio Motta, a leftist councillor who has criticised the government’s treatment of the blocos, questioned whether Rio’s mayor wanted to cast himself as “an enemy of carnival”. “The city hall is right to support the samba schools … but why haven’t they done the same for street carnival?” Motta asked, accusing authorities of depriving residents of their legal right to carnival. As Wednesday’s protest grew Juarez Santos, the president of the LGBTQ+ bloco Banda das Quengas (Band of the Floozies), reminisced about carnivals past, when huge sweat-drenched crowds mobbed his bloco’s sound system in the Cruz Vermelha square to hear Brazilian classics – and the mandatory anthem I Will survive! There would be no Gloria Gaynor in 2022, lamented Santos, whose rainbow vest featured the group’s name and cartoon of a muscular male dancer in a minuscule scarlet thong. “This year we have been silenced.”",News/World news,Rio carnival groups fight for right to party ahead of official celebrations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/rio-carnival-street-groups-party-official-celebrations
4/15/2022,"When a 13-year-old girl was detained in the arrivals hall at Manchester Airport in 2002 carrying heroin worth almost £1m, it was the pioneering criminal solicitor Mary Monson who was called in. Monson, who has died aged 74, was recognised as one of the north-west of England’s most experienced defence lawyers for juveniles. The teenage drug mule, who appeared older than her years, had flown in from Islamabad in Pakistan. She was charged with importing 11kg of heroin but was too scared to talk. Monson cleared her diary for the case, and over the next three months visited the terrified child almost every day, gradually winning her trust. In court, the charge was eventually dropped; the prosecution acknowledged that the girl was “more sinned against than sinning”. The case may not have been a classic courtroom victory but it was a vindication of Monson’s technique of dedicating time to secure a full understanding of – and providing friendship to – those caught up in the criminal justice system. Her clients were often from poor or immigrant backgrounds. As her reputation grew, her high profile trials included the Strangeways prison riot, “Gunchester” era gang killings of the 1980s and 90s, and the racially motivated Anthony Walker murder in Liverpool. More recently she was involved in regulatory cases such as those involving Cambridge Analytica/Facebook, Unaoil and the Grenfell investigation. The high court judge Sir Anthony Hayden, who worked with her, described Monson as a “powerhouse of energy, not always organised or structured, but completely indefatigable,” adding that “she provided a voice for those who otherwise would not have been heard in the system”. Monson was born in Tufnell Park, north London, and was brought up in what her family described as “respectable poverty”. Both her parents were from Ireland; her mother, Margaret (nee Connor), had left a County Mayo smallholding aged 14 to work as a servant, and her father, Joseph, also emigrated to England, where he became head porter at a London hotel. One of four children, Mary, the eldest, attended Our Lady of Sion grammar school in Holloway before going to Holborn College of Law in London, graduating in 1971. After working for the Automobile Association, she moved to Manchester in 1974 and became an articled clerk with Flint and Holmes solicitors. Her experiences in magistrates courts transformed her approach. The children she represented often did not have proper shoes and were rarely accompanied by a parent or adult. Some had been taught by older criminals, Fagin-like, to commit burglaries. Before the 1984 Police and Criminal Evidence Act, officers’ evidence was invariably believed. Monson was shocked at the sight of blood-stained walls and stories of youngsters being beaten. She challenged the police version of events and regularly won her clients bail. In a case where a cabin attendant faced charges of stealing miniature drink bottles and cigarettes, Monson arranged for a procession of pilots, fresh from long haul flights, to appear in court delivering testimony on the behalf of the wrongfully accused defendant, who was was acquitted. Hard-working, she was never a solicitor to accept statements at face value or to suffer fools gladly. The barrister Michael Mansfield, who stayed with Monson when they worked on cases together and recalled her terrifying rottweiler having to be restrained on his visits, praised her as “intrepid” in pursuing defence leads, for always being accessible to clients and for never giving up. She represented, he said, the “pinnacle of public service lawyers”. As soon as she could, in 1979, Monson had set up her own solicitors’ practice. That year she had also married Leon Kotrie, a Ukraine-born businessman who imported kosher vodka. When he later fell ill, they faced financial problems; their home was sold and Monson had to set up a new law firm. Leon died in 1996, but despite the personal difficulties she faced, Monson continued practising until shortly before her death. In later years she took up the cause of homeless people, donating generously to a breakfast club at the Salford and Eccles Unemployment Centre. Although not politically active, her sympathies were with socialism. When Donald Trump made his state visit to Britain in 2019, Monson organised a counter demonstration – an open-top bus tour of Manchester. “I have regarded my job as trying to apply a sticking plaster to the poor, disaffected and abused in society,” she told a radio interviewer. “I’m making a moral protest against his values … He stands only for Trump and greed … I’m interested in promoting humanity.” She is survived by two sons, Joseph and Liam, who both now work for the family law firm, Mary Monson solicitors, and Kotrie’s daughter from a previous relationship, Allie.

4/15/2022,"The organisers of the Monaco Grand Prix have said the race will remain on the Formula One calendar as the sport looks to accommodate new meetings. The street circuit’s contract ends this year but the president of the Automobile Club de Monaco, Michel Boeri, is confident a new deal will be agreed. Monte Carlo hosted its first F1 race in the series’ opening year in 1950 and has become globally recognised for its track laid out on the city’s winding streets. However, the course is no longer suited to modern F1 cars and the race is often an uneventful procession. In the past, such was the prestige of the event, the race was not required to pay a hosting fee, an arrangement ended by F1’s new owners, Liberty Media. F1 recently concluded a deal to hold a race in Las Vegas next year and are expected to add one at Kyalami in South Africa soon. With a season capped at 24 races, there is increasing pressure on meetings to justify their position. F1’s chief executive, Stefano Domenicali, warned that the “pedigree” of a race would not guarantee its place and that some events could be rotated on and off the schedule. With this year’s race scheduled for 29 May, Boeri maintained that Monaco would retain its spot. Speaking to race marshals this week, he said: “It was implied that the fees required were too excessive for Monaco and that the grand prix would no longer be held. That’s untrue. We are still in talks with them and must now seal the deal with a contract. “I can guarantee you that the grand prix will keep taking place beyond 2022. I don’t know if it will be a three- or five-year contract, but that’s a detail.” Meanwhile, the FIA has reacted to criticism from drivers about the speed of the Aston Martin safety car at the Australian Grand Prix. The reigning champion, Max Verstappen, was outspoken in his disapproval, noting that the drivers could not maintain tyre temperature behind it. “The safety car was driving so slow, it was like a turtle. Unbelievable,” he said. “It’s pretty terrible the way we are driving behind the safety car at the moment.” Other drivers joined his complaints, if with a lighter tone. Mercedes’ George Russell pointed out that he believed the Mercedes safety car was five seconds a lap quicker, to which race winner, Charles Leclerc, noted that a Ferrari version would be even faster. The FIA hit back by issuing a statement on Thursday, highlighting that it was not a performance issue with the Aston Martin. “The primary function of the safety car is not outright speed, but the safety of the drivers, marshals and officials,” they said. “The speed of the safety car is therefore generally dictated by race control, and not limited by the capabilities of the safety cars.” The Haas team, which dropped its title sponsor the Russian Uralkali company and driver Nikita Mazepin after the invasion of Ukraine, has responded to their claim for a return of payments with a forthright rejection and a counterclaim. The team is understood to have dismissed Uralkali’s request for $13m (£9.95m) and instead demanded $8.6m compensation for “loss of profits”.",Sport/Sport,Monaco Grand Prix organisers insist race will retain spot on F1 calendar,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/14/monaco-grand-prix-f1-calendar
4/15/2022,"Diego Simeone started clapping and how the Atlético Madrid supporters responded. There was still time to play in Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final second leg against Manchester City at the Metropolitano, the additional nine minutes not yet up and there would be even more than that, as it turned out. The Atlético manager later explained that his applause was for the fans, who had built a wall of noise during the tie, a fulminating backdrop to a high-stakes occasion. But why did he go so early with it? Perhaps he realised the game was up, the 0-0 unbreakable, City sure to advance thanks to Kevin De Bruyne’s first-leg goal. And so it was a little like a manager shaking hands with his opposite number before the final whistle has blown; a gesture of sportsmanship, something to create a moment. Did Simeone really think it was over? Or was it a ploy to create the energy for one last push, which Atlético did manage? In the 13th minute of stoppage time the substitute Ángel Correa unloaded for goal and he was denied by a smart Ederson save. Atlético were so close. But the longer that Simeone continued to clap and the crowd to follow him, the more the alternative reading presented itself. Like everybody in red and white, Simeone was beside himself with frustration at his team’s inability to capitalise on their second-half dominance and fuming at City’s attempts to waste time – the play-acting, the writhing about, the need for treatment. There was a sardonic undercurrent. Congratulations for winning like this. Like Atlético might do. Are City not supposed to be better, purer? Simeone would deny it. Just as Pep Guardiola had denied and would continue to deny having criticised Simeone and Atlético after the first leg. The City manager had said that “ever since prehistory” it had been hard to face a team that defends deep with two lines of five. Plenty of people in Madrid interpreted that as a dig but Guardiola maintained he was simply praising Atlético as the masters of the approach. Smiling or applauding while getting in the low blow; killing with kindness. It has been the theme of the meeting between the champions of Spain and England. The third reading of Simeone’s stoppage-time behaviour was the most unlikely. Was it grudging admiration for City? Finally you have learned how to close out a result. Guardiola has been cast as a magpie over the past days. He played like Liverpool against Liverpool in the 2-2 Premier League game on Sunday, using quick, long balls up the channels. Now he had played like Atlético against Atlético. “I try to imitate the best teams and learn,” Guardiola said after the Liverpool game with so much sincerity it felt as though he had to be sarcastic. It is the tone that so riles some of his rivals, including Simeone. “Often, those who are very eloquent are very intelligent and have a way of praising you dismissively,” Simeone said after Wednesday’s tie. “But those of us who maybe have less eloquence are not stupid.” Whichever way you sliced it, Guardiola and City had got under the skin of Simeone and Atlético. On one level, it was hilarious to hear Atlético bleating about City’s use of the dark arts, the very last word in pots and kettles. But more seriously, City had found a way to pass one of football’s greatest tests – getting through at the Metropolitano – and it was a new way for them, one to bind them even more tightly, particularly after the mass melee that flared in the 89th minute. There was sweetness in the second-half rearguard action, in the suffering, which was encapsulated by Phil Foden. The forward was battered and bloodied, his head bandaged from the 12th minute after he was cleaned out in an aerial challenge by Felipe. But he refused to be cowed. “Unbelievable competitive mentality,” City’s Rodri said. “We grow a lot in this sense in the last years. We need to keep improving because we are going to live moments like this in the next games. We need to have a strong mentality, to be together and never give up.” It remained a flawed City performance. Play as they did in the second half and they will most likely go out against Real Madrid in the semi-final. It was strange to see how City could not connect any kind of forward moves; much of it was sideways or passing for its own sake. When Atlético jumped into their press, City could not see the spaces. They were suffocated, barely able to cross halfway. City took on collateral damage, injuries to De Bruyne and Kyle Walker. The schedule remains intense and going the distance with an adversary such as Atlético, complete with the demands of travel to and from Madrid, is hardly the ideal preparation for another meeting with Liverpool on Saturday – in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. It has been lost on nobody at City that Liverpool were able to rest players in their home Champions League quarter-final second leg against Benfica on Wednesday, which was altogether smoother for them. But City are into their third Champions League semi-final, one step closer to the holy grail of a first triumph in the competition. The hope is that the thrill of it and how they got it done can override the maxed-out bodies and minds.",Sport/Football,Guardiola plays magpie again as Manchester City find joy in suffering | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/pep-guardiola-plays-magpie-manchester-city-atletico-madrid-liverpool
4/15/2022,"New York has been on edge since the Brooklyn subway shooting on Tuesday, which injured 29 people during the morning commute, including at least four schoolchildren. “First of all, thank god nobody died in this attack,” said Trevor Noah on Wednesday’s Daily Show. “That’s the main thing. It’s honestly a miracle, in fact. And kudos to all the people who stepped up to help each other in a crazy moment like this.” With New York on edge in the wake of a mass subway shooting, a hero stepped in: Zack Tahhan pic.twitter.com/bG1UkRSyiD “People always say that New Yorkers are selfish and rude and won’t lift a finger for other people,” he continued, “and that’s true … on a normal day. On a normal day, New Yorkers are not trying to help anybody.” But after seven years in New York City, Noah had learned that “when shit hits the fan, New Yorkers come together. Always, always.” Cell phone footage from the attack on Tuesday, in which the suspect Frank R James released a smoke bomb and shot a 9mm Glock indiscriminately, shows passengers carrying others out of the station, performing first aid, and looking for the shooter. It took authorities 30 hours to apprehend James, 62, in part because the security cameras at the 36th street station in the Sunset Park neighborhood failed to capture anything during the attack. The MTA has 10,000 cameras dispersed in 472 subways stations, and claims that only those three were not operational that day. Noah didn’t buy it. “Really? Out of 10,000 cameras in the subway system, the only three that weren’t working are the ones that could’ve helped. Really? Uh, that’s a crazy stroke of bad luck if it were true.” James was arrested in Manhattan after a tip from 21-year-old Zach Tahhan, who was, ironically enough, installing security cameras at an apartment nearby. “So if the city had hired Zach to fix their busted-ass subway cameras, then maybe Zach wouldn’t have had to get them out of this mess in the first place!” Noah mused. Noah thanked Zach, as well as “all the New Yorkers who stepped up on the subway yesterday, because this event turned out a whole lot better than it could have. And you know whatever this guy intended to do to New York, it didn’t work. New York is a tough place. After 9/11, New York bounced back. After Hurricane Sandy, New York bounced back.” After the devastating first wave of Covid, too. “The point is: this city keeps coming back and that’s what makes it the greatest city in the world.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also celebrated the arrest of James after a tense 30-hour manhunt in the city. Authorities suspected James, he explained, because a credit card with his name on it had been found at the scene, as had a key to a van he had rented. “He also left a cheek swab, a filled-out tax return and his SoulCycle emergency contact,” Colbert quipped. “It’s fortunate that James left behind plenty of evidence,” Colbert continued, because of the security camera malfunction. “Well, that’s what the MTA gets for hiring the same guy who did the cameras in Jeffrey Epstein’s cell,” Colbert joked. “It does explain the new subway safety posters: ‘if you see something, that’s cool. We didn’t!’” The host also touched on a “tough week” for Joe Biden, from the highest inflation rates since 1981 to a speech in Iowa in which a bird appeared to poop on his lapel. “Look, folks, this is the kind of story late night was made for,” said Colbert. “Steve Allen started the Tonight Show in the 1950s to talk about a pelican guano-bombing Ike. So covering this recent incident is the Late Show’s duty.” “That bird is now the Republican frontrunner in 2024,” Colbert quipped of the splatter above Biden’s lapel. “It’s already picked its #2.” However, a reporter on the scene and the White House communications team clarified that the alleged bird poop was actually corn powder dripping from the ceiling of an active factory. “Fine, fact check grudgingly accepted,” said Colbert. “It wasn’t bird poop. It was just a gentle rain of industrial corn dookie.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel commented on the justice department’s investigation into whether Rudy Giuliani violated any laws when he flew to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskiy into dig up alleged dirt on Hunter Biden. “Remember that? When Trump sent Goonie to not so subtly threaten to withhold military assistance that we now know how desperately they needed it to come up with damaging information about his opponent’s son?” The FBI has already “raided Rudy’s cave” and so far Trump’s former lawyer has cooperated. “He even let investigators look inside the coffin he sleeps in during the daylight hours,” Kimmel quipped. Kimmel also mocked another frequent target, Texas senator Ted Cruz, who did a live podcast taping in which an audience member asked: “Assuming it would end global hunger, would you fellate another man?” “Only if that man was Donald Trump, is what the answer is,” said Kimmel.",Arts/Culture,"Trevor Noah on Brooklyn subway attack: ‘Whatever this guy intended, it didn’t work’ ",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/14/trevor-noah-brooklyn-subway-attack-zach-tahhan
4/15/2022,"Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s former top adviser, will give testimony to the January 6 committee today, according to the Associated Press. The reported cooperation of Miller is further evidence that the House investigation into the Capitol riot is lapping at the doors of the Trump Oval Office, after the former president’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, both former senior White House advisers, gave their own testimony in recent weeks. According to two sources cited by the AP, it is unclear if Miller will appear in person or virtually before the nine-member bipartisan panel. The fact he is appearing at all is a significant development, however, and probably another major blow to Trump’s efforts to shield information about his movements on the day of the insurrection and subsequent efforts to overturn the presidential election he lost to Joe Biden. Miller, considered Trump’s top aide through the entirety of his single term in office, has fiercely resisted previous efforts to get him to testify after receiving a subpoena in November. At the time, Bennie Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the panel, said Miller had “participated in efforts to spread false information about alleged voter fraud”, the basis of Trump’s big lie that his election defeat was fraudulent. How cooperative Miller will be in terms of the testimony he has to offer remains to be seen. It is likely that Miller’s decision to appear was prompted by last week’s House vote to hold former Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in contempt for their refusal to comply with their own subpoenas. Miller’s testimony – if he is cooperative – could be some of the most valuable and compelling evidence the January 6 inquiry will have collected to date about Trump’s involvement in the deadly insurrection. Miller was ever-present at Trump’s side throughout his administration, a supremely loyal and focused character credited as the mastermind of some of the most controversial and harshest policies it enacted. An extremist known for his white nationalist and far-right views, Miller was central to almost every decision the former president made while in office, as well as ultra-hardline immigration policies Trump would probably have enacted had he won a second term. It is that loyalty to his old boss, and to Trumpism itself, that has analysts wondering if Miller will in fact be forthcoming or will instead plead the fifth amendment to questioning. There is already speculation that Miller’s agreement to appear – which neither he nor the panel has yet confirmed – was simply an exercise in avoiding the fate of Scavino and Navarro. Miller’s appearance tightens the committee’s focus in the final stages of its investigation on the inner circle of Trump, who has vociferously pushed the big lie that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent. The former president’s actions on the day of the insurrection and afterward have been under scrutiny, most recently a revelation that calls he made on 6 January were hidden from the official log. The inquiry has also looked into an illegal scheme allegedly pushed by Trump and his supporters to put forward fake electors to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the electoral college. The panel has said it will probably hold public hearings this spring, and a report is expected before this year’s midterm elections. Polling shows Republicans in a strong position to seize a majority in the House, at which point most observers believe they would shut the inquiry down if it is still ongoing.",News/US news,Former Trump adviser Stephen Miller to testify before January 6 committee,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-testify-january-6-committee

And through his attacks on his enemies, including civil society and the free press, Putin has turned Russia’s domestic laws into a tool of repression. “President Putin’s actions, and the actions of many leaders of his ilk, remind us that while law can provide the moral basis for a just and human society, the imposition of unjust statutes creates a platform for tyranny.”",News/US news,Letter: Madeleine Albright obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/letter-madeleine-albright-obituary
4/15/2022,"A stumpy-legged creature that was half a metre long and boasted a surprisingly long toe on each of its hind feet has been discovered by experts analysing fossils from a prehistoric lake in Scotland. The creature is thought to have lived around 330m years ago – a time when what is now Scotland sat on the equator and featured not only a warm climate but a wealth of vegetation and even volcanic eruptions. Dr Timothy Smithson, co-author of the research at the University of Cambridge, said the rocks in which the fossils were found were laid down in an isolated lake, but that the animal would have lived on the land as the lake would have been too hot, or had the wrong chemical balance, to sustain life. “There were no fish or other aquatic animals in the lake until much later,” he said, adding that a diverse array of fossils have previously been recovered from the quarry including scorpions, millipedes and a limbless snake-like creature. “They seem to have fallen or been chased into the lake, were unable to get out, died either because it was hot water, or chemically unsuitable for survival, or they drowned and then sunk to the bottom,” said Smithson. Writing in the journal Communications Biology, Smithson and colleagues report that they named the newly discovered creature Termonerpeton makrydactylus. The moniker means “boundary crawler” and “elongated toe”, and refers to the boundary walls near the East Kirkton quarry where the late Scottish fossil collector Stan Wood is thought to have found the specimen in the mid-1980s, and the unusually long fourth digit of the creature’s hind feet. Smithson said the creature would have looked a bit like a lizard, with big feet but stumpy legs, adding the creature’s long toe was unusual in an animal from that time. “A similar long fourth toe is found in living lizards where it is thought to extend the stride length and thus allowing them cover ground more quickly. It may also help the animal negotiate a variety of substrates from firm ground to shingle and sand,” he said. “This may have been advantageous to Termonerpeton too, helping it to escape predators and also negotiate an area prone to volcanic ash falls as well as the firm soil and leaf litter.” Smithson added the creature lived before the two modern groups of tetrapods – amphibians such as frogs and newts, and amniotes such as reptiles and mammals – evolved. “It was on the line leading to reptiles, birds and mammals but was not a direct ancestor of any of these,” he said.It is thought the fossil of the long toed-creature, which includes bones of the ribs, pelvis and left leg and hind foot among other features, sat in a drawer after it was donated by Wood to the University Museum of Zoology in Cambridge in the 1990s, and when it was first examined it was thought to be an example of another animal that had already been discovered. But the new analysis reveals it to be something different. “It is exciting because it shows for the first time that early tetrapods were experimenting with different ways of growing their feet to deal with walking on land,” said Smithson. “The finds at East Kirkton quarry represent the earliest evidence anywhere in the world of terrestrial tetrapods, animals that seemingly lived all their life on land,” he added. “They lacked any evidence of amphibious habits – although we have no evidence of how they may have reproduced.” Dr Nick Fraser of the National Museums Scotland, which houses one of the other East Kirkton quarry fossils, but who was not involved in the study, said the findings were exciting, not least as they show the evolution of terrestrial locomotion in early tetrapods was complex, and did not follow a regular pattern. “For me it also suggests that the amniotes had started to flourish somewhat earlier than previously thought,” he said. “We are seeing a much greater diversity of different types from this time period.”",News/Science,"Scottish quarry fossils belong to long-toed lizard-like creature, experts say ",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/14/scottish-quarry-fossils-belong-to-long-toed-lizard-like-creature-experts-say
4/15/2022,"Germany’s chancellor is under growing pressure to authorise the delivery of heavy weaponry to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s looming eastern offensive, with Olaf Scholz’s coalition partners accusing him of failing to live up to his promises. The centre-left leader had surprised even close partners in his three-party coalition when on 27 February he announced an “epochal change” in Germany’s foreign policy to boost defence spending and relax its restrictive stance on exporting weapons to conflict zones. Six weeks on, prominent politicians from allied parties urged the Social Democrat to follow up words with actions after Germany was accused of stalling on delivering heavy weaponry to Ukraine and blocking a wholesale ban on Russian oil and gas. Scholz has to “not just purse his lips but start to whistle”, said the Free Democratic party’s Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, who chairs the Bundestag’s defence committee. With a view to the apparent failure of economic sanctions in stopping Vladimir Putin’s military campaign, she said there had to be a renewed focus on hard power. “There is only one answer that Russia understands: to continue to try to end the war through talks – but with one hand visibly on the holster,” said Strack-Zimmermann. “That means that Germany has to also supply Ukraine with heavy weapons to help it defend itself, as long as they can be handled by the Ukrainian army.” Her appeal was echoed by Anton Hofreiter, a leading figure on the left of the German green party: “The problem lies in the chancellory,” Hofreiter told the broadcaster Deutsche Welle. “We have to finally start supply Ukraine with what it needs, and that’s heavy weapons.” He continued: “I can only speculate why the chancellor is stepping on the brakes like this. I can see no logical reason for it. But with his actions, the chancellor is not only damaging the situation in Ukraine, but he is also massively damaging Germany’s reputation in Europe and the world.” Hofreiter and Strack-Zimmermann, along with Michael Roth of the SPD, travelled to Ukraine earlier in the week. By the end of March, Germany had supplied Ukraine with €186m (£154m) worth of military supplies, including rocket-propelled grenades, anti-aircraft rockets, machine guns and ammunition, but not heavy weapons such as tanks, helicopters or fighter planes. Over the weekend, Ukraine’s ambassador to Berlin, Andrij Melnyk, expressed a wish for Germany to aid his country against an expected major Russian offensive by delivering Leopard battle tanks, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Cobra weapons location radars and the armoured howitzer Panzerhaubitze 2000. “With them we can not only try to stop the expected huge Russian offensive in the east, but also to reconquer the occupied territories in the south,” Melnyk told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung. According to Welt am Sonntag newspaper, the Ukrainian government has made Germany an offer for 100 Panzerhaubitze 2000s that it is hoping to buy straight from the German armed forces and which the latter would then replace with newly built armoured howitzers. The gap this would create in Germany’s military arsenal cannot not be filled before 2024. Because of this, Scholz’s government is reportedly lukewarm about the deal. The chancellor has said any arms deliveries to Ukraine must not put at risk Germany’s Nato commitments in other regions, such as the Baltic states. Scholz’s party also say Germany should not deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine until Nato allies reach a joint decision to do so. So far, only the Czech Republic has confirmed that it has sent T-72 tanks and BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles. “The federal government is closely coordinating with our international partners,” said Rolf Mützenich, chair of the SPD’s parliamentary group. “Germany must not go alone.” But Scholz’s critics say he is deliberately allowing bureaucratic hurdles to slow down a decision on weapons exports in an effort to pacify those within his party who are still holding out for a diplomatic settlement with the Kremlin. “Of course there are members of the SPD’s parliamentary group who are still in shock because their idea of Russia has brutally collapsed,” said Strack-Zimmermann. “I think the chancellor is still paying too much respect to their sensitivities.” A survey by the polling firm Infratest dimap released on Thursday showed a majority of German respondents favoured heavy weapons exports over an energy embargo that could hit Germany’s economy. Fifty-five per cent of those questioned were in favour, with only 37% opposed. A clear opposition to arms exports was recorded only among supporters of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland.",News/World news,German chancellor ‘stalling on heavy weaponry to Ukraine’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/german-chancellor-stalling-heavy-weaponry-ukraine-coalition-olaf-scholz-russia-offensive
4/15/2022,"Patricia MacLachlan, who has died aged 84, was the author of more than 60 novels and picture books for children, among them Sarah, Plain and Tall (1985). This short novel for young readers has sold around 7m copies and garnered an impressive list of awards. The story is set on a poor farm on the prairie and told in the first person by 10-year-old Anna, carer of her brother Caleb, whose mother died giving birth to him. She records the arrival of the eponymous Sarah, to take care of the family. Drawing much on nature, particularly on spring and its regenerative qualities, Sarah, Plain and Tall is a vivid story of great intensity, despite having little obvious drama. It embodies MacLachlan’s ability to weave a powerful narrative around family interactions that creates a fully realised picture despite being restrained – and told briefly. Sarah, Plain and Tall touched readers around the world. In 1991 it was turned into a TV film starring Glenn Close as Sarah, for which MacLachlan wrote the screenplay. Subsequently she added four more titles about the same family growing up. Although not strictly autobiographical, MacLachlan’s stories were largely based on realistic and perceptive observations of family life, which she conveyed with a kind and humorous eye and a simple clarity that gave the stories a luminous quality. Writing largely realistic stories as either picture books or short novels, she was gifted at telling stories with a big impact in a way that was also spare stylistically and in length. An only child, Patricia was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her parents, Madonna (nee Moss) and Philo Pritzkau, were from Kansas and North Dakota respectively. They felt connected to a way of life shaped by the prairie and her father was also proud of his Russian heritage. Following her father’s promotions in the teaching profession, the family moved eastwards, where he became an education professor at the University of Connecticut; her mother was an English teacher. Thereafter Patricia remained in New England but carried a bag of prairie dust with her wherever she went. That sense of place was a constant theme in her books and, both from her own experience and from her conversations with many children, she never lost her belief that what you knew first was of critical importance. She retained a deep connection with her childhood and, school aside, described it as happy. She had loving parents who introduced her to books and music, she created an imaginary friend and she became an accomplished pianist and cellist. Patricia went to Windham high school, New Hampshire, and studied English education at the University of Connecticut. Believing that life experience was of equal importance to study, she briefly dropped out of her course and took a job at a publishing company in New York. The choice of publishing was coincidental: following a dismal English lesson at school and the crushing comment on her work by the teacher, she had written in her diary as an eight-year-old: “I shall try not to be writer.” She graduated in 1962 and married Robert MacLachlan, a clinical psychologist, in the same year. On graduation she taught English at an elementary school in Manchester, Connecticut, for a year but it was not an experience she particularly enjoyed. Following the birth of her three children she stayed at home while also volunteering, including serving on the board of a children’s social services organisation that helped families in trouble. These years later provided much inspiration for her writing as she kept notes on all she saw of family behaviour. Writing about her work she later claimed that most of her stories began with a character and that many of them came from these years. Her parents, husband, children and friends all make appearances in her books. MacLachlan’s career writing picture books took off swiftly. The Sick Day (1979) and Through Grandpa’s Eyes (1980) were published almost simultaneously. Other titles followed in quick succession and MacLachlan’s reputation grew rapidly in the following years. It was affirmed when Sarah, Plain and Tall won the Newbery medal and the Scott O’Dell award for historical fiction, and MacLachlan went on to write several picture books with her daughter, Emily. Her husband died in 2015. She is survived by Emily, two sons, John and Jamison, and six grandchildren.

4/15/2022,"‘The red carpets will be sumptuous!” announced Cannes festival director Pierre Lescure bullishly, seated aside the beaming general delegate Thierry Frémaux. And the mood is pretty bold, now that the festival is returning to a post-Covid normality after cancellation and then disruption in 2020 and 2021. The festival apparently isn’t giving us the new David Lynch movie that had been feverishly predicted – and the traditional patriotic pining for Brits continues, with none in competition this year. But Cannes is lining up new work from its established alpha auteurs: Claire Denis, David Cronenberg, George Miller, Kelly Reichardt, Park Chan-wook and James Gray, as well as the returns of Palme winners Ruben Östlund, the Dardenne brothers, Cristian Mungiu and Hirokazu Kore-eda. And there are two huge Hollywood tentpole attractions: Cannes regular Baz Luhrmann is bringing the glitz with his whopping spectacular Elvis, about Elvis Presley, with Austin Butler as the King and Tom Hanks as Colonel Tom Parker. (Interestingly, Presley’s granddaughter Riley Keough makes her directorial debut at Cannes with Beast, co-directed with Gina Gammell in the Un Certain Regard sidebar.) Tom Cruise is also coming to Cannes with his sequel Top Gun: Maverick. The announcement of the official selection is always greeted with scrutiny of its gender balance and global representation – yet with #Cannes2022, the issue always had to be Russia and Ukraine. What are the optics here? Cannes does have a Russian film in competition: Tchaikovsky’s Wife, directed by Kirill Serebrinnikov – about Tchaikovsky’s tumultuous marital relationship with Antonina Miliukova. (An echo of Ken Russell’s The Music Lovers perhaps?) But Serebrinnikov is a noted anti-Putin dissident, unable to attend Cannes for his last two films because of a travel ban, and now effectively exiled in Germany. Cannes also has a movie in its Special Screening sidebar by the Ukrainian director Sergei Loznitsa, whose 2018 film Donbass was a brilliant and disturbing study of Russia’s psychological war of attrition in eastern Ukraine. His new film is The Natural History of Destruction, based on WG Sebald’s 1999 book about the massive allied air bombardment of German civilians during the second world war. The opener is a zombie comedy from Michel Hazanavicius: Z (Comme Z), or Final Cut – remade from the Michael Frayn-esque Japanese film One Cut of the Dead. Park Chan-wook’s Decision to Leave is a Korean mystery thriller featuring Chinese star Tang Wei. James Gray’s Armageddon Time is a boyhood drama set in 1960s New York, with Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Strong. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Broker is a drama about the “baby boxes” in which newborn babies in South Korea are abandoned. David Cronenberg’s horror thriller Crimes of the Future (from his own, long-gestating script) promises to be one of the sexiest titles of the festival, with Léa Seydoux, Kristen Stewart and Viggo Mortensen. Ali Abbasi, director of the cult film Border, now gives us Holy Spider, the Schraderian story of a holy man who sets out to “cleanse” the Iranian city of Mashhad of immorality. Claire Denis’s The Stars at Noon is based on the novel by Denis Johnson and set in Nicaragua – a return to her keynote theme of empire and colonialism. Ruben Östlund’s Triangle of Sadness promises to be another of his mordant satires of the absurdities of human nature – a desert island nightmare for the super-rich with echoes, perhaps, of The Admirable Crichton. The Dardenne brothers, Luc and Jean-Pierre – double Palme d’Or winners – return with Tori and Lokita, about two young people from Africa exiled in Belgium. Another Belgian, Lukas Dhont, known for his trans drama Girl, now comes to the competition for the first time with Close, about the disintegrating friendship of two teenage boys.Kelly Reichardt is one of the biggest names on the European festival circuit, as the possessor of that prized indie auteur sensibility, and her Showing Up has Michelle Williams as an artist on the verge of a career breakthrough. Romanian director Cristian Mungiu is a fourth-timer at Cannes – little is yet known about his new film here, RMN. Elsewhere, Cannes stalwart Arnaud Desplechin returns with Brother and Sister, showcasing Marion Cotillard and Melvil Poupaud. Cannes remains tough on Netflix content and loyal to theatrical distribution and the big-screen ethos. But its most notable announcement this year is a partnership with TikTok, platforming exclusive backstage/interview content while diplomatically shifting the tone away from its haughty mandarin dismissal of the digital streaming world. The Cannes film festival runs from 17 to 28 May.",Arts/Film,Cannes 2022: the alpha auteurs line up for a post-pandemic party,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/14/cannes-2022-alpha-auteurs-david-cronenberg-baz-luhrmann-claire-denis-dardenne-brothers-kelly-reichardt
4/15/2022,"Boris Johnson made a special request for Evgeny Lebedev and a Kremlin-linked Russian dignitary to bypass security checks when he met them as London mayor in 2015, the Guardian has learned. Johnson’s friendship with Lebedev has come under scrutiny in recent weeks, including the prime minister’s decision to award the Russian-born media owner a peerage in spite of concerns raised by the intelligence and security services. Official documents show Johnson had a meeting in his office at City Hall in 2015 with Lebedev and Mikhail Piotrovsky, the director of Russia’s State Hermitage Museum, who has links to Vladimir Putin. According to an email released under freedom of information laws, Johnson’s office describes the two men as “VIPs” and adds: “The mayor has asked specifically that they are not asked to go through the airport-style security.” No meetings or written notes of the meeting were retained but a report to City Hall subsequently said they were “discussing cultural prospects in London”. Labour said Johnson’s request was a sign that his “carefree attitude to British security runs deep in his bones”. Lebedev, the owner of the Independent and Evening Standard and the son of a former KGB spy, has always denied any links with the Kremlin and has condemned Russia’s war in Ukraine. Piotrovsky is a significant figure in Russian culture, as the director of the State Hermitage since 1990, and in politics, as one of 75 people who were asked by Putin to help redraft Russia’s constitution so he could stay in power. He has been a member of the Duma, was awarded the order of friendship by Putin in 2016, and has been on the board of the state-owned Channel 1 television. Piotrovsky was a strong advocate for Russia’s retaking of Palmyra, in Syria, from Islamic State, saying it was important for cultural preservation. In 2016, Johnson expressed admiration for Putin’s “ruthless clarity” in providing Bashar al-Assad’s troops with military backing to save the archaeology of the city. In 2015, Britain’s relationship with Russia was already difficult because of Putin’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea, but Russia had not reached its current pariah status in the west, with political channels remaining open. A spokesperson for Johnson would not comment on what the 2015 meeting with Lebedev present was about or why he had requested the usual security arrangements be lifted. “As mayor of London, Boris Johnson met a wide range of relevant individuals, media outlets and businesses, all of which were declared as required,” she said. “This government and the Conservative party have strongly held Russia to account at all times and have been some of their harshest critics internationally, from our response to the Salisbury poisonings to the strong action we have taken following Putin’s recent illegal invasion of Ukraine.” Asked what the meeting was about and why the guests were allowed to skip security, Lebedev said: “It’s news to me that the most senior curator in Russia was allowed to bypass security checks. “It seems to be the mayor of London offering a courtesy to a towering figure in the world of arts, and trying to make him feel as comfortable as he could by sparing him a metal detector and signing in.” Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, said it was about a “pattern of behaviour dating back years. He puts personal friendships above the public interest.” Labour also claimed that Johnson “has never been serious about taking the tough measures needed to eradicate Putin’s influence in Britain”. Controversy has surrounded Lebedev’s peerage ever since it emerged that the House of Lords appointments commission had expressed concerns about his elevation and asked Downing Street to reconsider in March 2020, after advice from Britain’s spy agencies. The appointment went through only after it was resubmitted amid pressure from Downing Street. The chair of the commission that advised on Lebedev’s appointment has now been summoned to give evidence to MPs when parliament returns next week. Paul Bew, an Irish historian, will appear before parliament’s public administration committee on Wednesday to answer what its chair described as “very serious questions” about Downing Street’s role in the appointment. “We will be holding an evidence session on the role of the House of Lords appointments commission with Lord Bew,” the committee’s Conservative chair, William Wragg, said in a letter to Rayner. He said members would raise some of the issues regarding Lebedev’s elevation in the session. The spy agencies had told the commission that the issue related to Lebedev’s father, Alexander Lebedev. During the late cold war period, Lebedev Sr worked undercover at the Soviet embassy in London. His real employer was KGB foreign intelligence, and he left in 1992 with the rank of colonel. Johnson has known Evgeny Lebedev for years. The prime minister has been a regular guest at parties hosted by Lebedev in London and at his converted castle in Perugia, Italy. After one such event in April 2018, while Johnson was foreign secretary, he was seen at a nearby airport reportedly looking as if he had slept in his clothes, having apparently attended without his usual security detail.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson asked for Evgeny Lebedev to skip City Hall security in 2015 ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/14/boris-johnson-asked-for-evgeny-lebedev-to-skip-city-hall-security-in-2015
4/15/2022,"The actor Ron Pember, who has died aged 87, was familiar to television audiences thanks to his wiry physique and his long, thin and cadaverous face, often moustachioed. His prominent cheekbones, domed forehead and darting eyes were excellent tools for conveying wily factotums, jobsworth officials, dodgy spivs and seedy operators on both sides of the law. Hard-working, natural and versatile, he swung happily from good value cameos to leading character parts, with his role as radio operator and resistance member Alain Muny in Secret Army (1977-79) cementing his place as a television favourite. Now often unjustly languishing in the shadow of the sitcom ’Allo ’Allo, which plundered it for comic effect, Secret Army was a respected, sophisticated drama that brought nuance to its depiction of a fictional resistance movement in German-occupied Belgium during the second world war, regularly drawing audiences of 16 million. He was also a deft comedy turn. Recurring appearances in the Dick Emery Show (1975-81), the Two Ronnies (1980-84), and in the sitcom Sink Or Swim (1980-81) augmented many memorable guest roles, including as tenants’ association chairman Baz in Only Fools and Horses (1983) and a sadistic taxman in Red Dwarf (1988). Born in Plaistow, then in Essex, Ron was the youngest of five children of Gladys (nee Orchard), a waitress at a Lyons’ Corner House, and William, a painter and decorator. He was educated at Eastbrook secondary modern school in Dagenham, where his family had moved during the second world war. His love for theatre blossomed when his father regularly took him to the People’s Palace entertainment venue in Mile End, and he was soon performing with amateur groups and helping out backstage at local theatres. He left school at 14, doggedly writing to theatrical greats for advice (they all replied encouragingly) and joining an Arts Council theatre company performing Shakespeare in pubs across County Durham in 1949. National service (1952-54) took him to Egypt with the Royal Air Force and touring the Middle East with the RAF Show Band. He then worked in variety theatre and was part of a comedy and singing trio before joining the Penguin Players repertory company at Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, in 1957. Two years later a cold, dishevelled Pember doorstepped the actor and producer Bernard Miles, who ran the Mermaid theatre in London, asking for work and explaining that he had come from Dagenham. “You look like you’ve walked here,” sniffed Miles. “I have,” came the rejoinder. Impressed, Miles cast Pember in Treasure Island, beginning a long, fruitful series of collaborations, with Pember acting in and/or directing many Mermaid productions, including Enter Solly Gold (1970) and Shakespeare’s Rome (co-directed with Miles, 1981). Despite his TV ubiquity, theatre was his first love – in 1974 he co-wrote and composed the musical Jack the Ripper, which debuted at the Players’ theatre in London before transferring across the city to the Ambassadors. He enjoyed a lengthy association with the Royal Shakespeare Company – he was the Porter in Trevor Nunn’s 1974 Macbeth and a sardonic, rasping, cockney Feste in Twelfth Night the same year. He was also part of the early National Theatre company (1964-66), and rejoined the NT later, performing in a number of its productions every year between 1981 and 1988 and proving invaluable to directors such as David Hare, Richard Eyre and Alan Ayckbourn. He considered his NT performance as Sganarelle in Don Juan at the Cottesloe theatre in 1981 as his best. Pember’s prolific TV career, starting in 1961, included roles in Nicholas Nickleby (1977), The Gentle Touch (1980), HG Wells’s The Invisible Man (1984) and Rumpole of the Bailey, as career criminal Den Timson ((1987-92). His film career included supporting roles in Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Death Line (1972), The Land That Time Forgot (1974), Aces High (1976) and Personal Services (1987) – and he was front-billed as batman Dobbs in the ill-fated Bulldog Drummond pastiche movie, Bullshot (1983). When he was playing Scrooge in his own adaptation of A Christmas Carol at the Mermaid theatre in 1992 (a show he had devised three years earlier at the Birmingham Rep), he suffered a stroke. This compelled him to retire, and in 1998 he moved to Southend-on-Sea. In 1958 he met Yvonne Tylee when she visited Bexhill as a summer show dancer, and they married the following year. She survives him, as do their children, Pauline, David and Catherine.

4/15/2022,"Aman who fled Afghanistan just before the Taliban retook Kabul said the UK government’s plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda felt more like a political announcement than an attempt to tackle human trafficking. Omar, 31, who arrived by small boat from Calais last August, was uneasy about the distinction made by the prime minister between those who come to Britain by legal routes and those who do not, pointing out that for many people fleeing war zones there are no legal routes they can take to claim asylum in the UK. He fled Afghanistan after escaping an assassination attempt. A human rights journalist, who had also worked for the ministry of foreign affairs under the old regime, Omar believed he would continue to be targeted, so he flew to Turkey, continued to Calais by road, and was helped to cross the Channel by people-smugglers. He left his wife and two young sons in Kabul. He is currently waiting for his asylum claim to be processed, staying in a hotel in London with about 120 other asylum seekers, many of whom have been waiting for 14 months for their claims to be assessed. His brother, a former British embassy employee, was last August accepted on to the UK’s Afghan resettlement programme, but Omar had fled Afghanistan earlier and there was no legal route for him to come to the UK to seek sanctuary. The two faced similar threats in Afghanistan but only one was given access to the resettlement scheme. “The system needs to be reformed, but this is not the answer. This feels a very political announcement,” he said. He did not feel the announcement was directed primarily at saving lives or combating the people-smuggling gangs. “There are lots of other ways to stop people from dying in boats. They could make a more flexible visa regime for people fleeing Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. I had no alternative, except to take a boat – there was no way for me to come here legally. “How will the government distinguish between people who are economic migrants and those who are genuine asylum seekers? That process is taking more than a year at the moment.” He suggested it would be a better solution to divert the money that the government is spending on new facilities in Rwanda towards employing more staff in the UK to work on clearing the current backlog of asylum cases and on moving people out of hotels. “Or they could set up a big processing campus for them here, to fast-track the process there.” He was uncertain about whether or not it would prove to be a deterrent. “The smugglers will tell people that the rules won’t apply to them, they will tell them that everything will be fine. They will continue to charge people between £4,000 and £10,000 to cross.” Omar speaks fluent English and has some family in the UK, so it seemed the obvious place to come. He dismissed the implication that because he is a young man, he should be classified as someone likely to be an economic migrant rather than a refugee. “People gamble their lives when they cross the Channel, you’re prepared to sacrifice everything for the chance to live in a peaceful society in the UK. It wasn’t something I did for fun; I came to this country to save my life.”",News/World news,‘This is not the answer’: asylum-seeker in UK slams Rwanda plans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/there-was-no-way-to-come-here-legally-asylum-seeker-in-uk-slams-rwanda-plans
