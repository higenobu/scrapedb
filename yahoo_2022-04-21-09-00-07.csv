4/21/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) -In a show of strength two months into its assault on Ukraine, Russia test-launched a new nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile which President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday would make Moscow's enemies stop and think. Putin was shown on TV being told by the military that the long-awaited Sarmat missile had been test-launched for the first time from Plesetsk in northwest Russia and hit targets in the Kamchatka peninsula, nearly 6,000 km (3,700 miles) away. The test of the Sarmat, under development for years, did not surprise the West, but came at a moment of extreme geopolitical tension. Russia has yet to capture any major cities since it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Ukraine's defence ministry was not immediately available for comment. ""The new complex has the highest tactical and technical characteristics and is capable of overcoming all modern means of anti-missile defence. It has no analogues in the world and won't have for a long time to come,"" Putin said. ""This truly unique weapon will strengthen the combat potential of our armed forces, reliably ensure Russia's security from external threats and provide food for thought for those who, in the heat of frenzied aggressive rhetoric, try to threaten our country."" Announcing the invasion eight weeks ago, Putin made a pointed reference to Russia's nuclear forces and warned the West that any attempt to get in its way ""will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history."" Days later, he ordered Russia's nuclear forces to be put on high alert. ""The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last month. Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday the Sarmat was fired from a silo launcher at 1512 Moscow time (1212 GMT). Russia's nuclear forces will start taking delivery of the new missile ""in the autumn of this year"" once testing is complete, Tass quoted Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, as saying on Wednesday. SYMBOLIC TIMING Jack Watling of the RUSI think-tank in London said there was an element of posturing and symbolism involved, less than three weeks before the annual Victory Day parade where Russia shows off its latest weapons. ""The timing of the test reflects the Russians wanting to have something to show as a technological achievement in the lead-up to Victory Day, at a time when a lot of their technology has not delivered the results they would have liked,"" Watling said. Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the launch was an important milestone after years of delays caused by funding issues and design challenges. He said more tests would be needed before Russia could actually deploy it in place of ageing SS-18 and SS-19 missiles that were ""well past their sell-by date"". Barrie said the Sarmat's ability to carry 10 or more warheads and decoys, and Russia's option of firing it over either of the Earth's poles, posed a challenge to ground and satellite-based radar and tracking systems. Igor Korotchenko, editor in chief of Russia's National Defence magazine, told RIA news agency it was a signal to the West that Moscow was capable of meting out ""crushing retribution that will put an end to the history of any country that has encroached on the security of Russia and its people"". Ukraine has mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions to try to force Russia to withdraw forces Moscow says are on a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists.

4/21/2022,"The prominent former editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a highly popular state-run Chinese media outlet, published a commentary on Saturday urging Chinese citizens to “prepare for a military struggle” in the near future.

The commentary, written by journalist Hu Xijin, came after U.S. senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and six other U.S. officials visited Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, last Thursday. The visit was strongly denounced by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who warned that China is “firmly opposed to any form of official exchange between the U.S. and Taiwan.”

Hu, who resigned from his post at the end of last year after three decades at the newspaper, remains a vocal and influential state media figure with around 460,000 Twitter followers.

Earlier this month, Hu wrote an article for the Global Times stating that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which China claims as a part of its territory, would be “the most serious provocation by Washington to China on the Taiwan question since the island's then regional leader Lee Teng-hui visited the US in 1996.”

On Twitter, he simultaneously wrote that Pelosi was “playing with fire” and that “there must be serious consequences for her visit.”

In his most recent comments about the highly tense U.S.-China-Taiwan situation, as reported by Newsweek, Hu asserted that there is a “very high probability” that there will “ultimately” be a “direct military confrontation.” He noted there was a ""sense of crisis"" in Taiwan.

""As the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorates, we must prepare for a military struggle,"" Hu wrote.

Regardless of who starts the confrontation, Hu added that any kind of “high-intensity military crisis,” even if not war, would be highly consequential.

As to whether the U.S. would aid Taiwan with military support in the event of a Chinese invasion, Sen. Graham declared on Friday during his meeting with President Tsai Ing-Wen that “every option is on the table.”

Tensions have continued to rise between China and Taiwan since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered heightened speculation about the possibility of China invading Taiwan. The U.S. continues to showcase support for Taiwan by sending high-profile envoys to the island nation’s capital.

4/21/2022,"WASHINGTON — Russia’s halting efforts to conduct electromagnetic warfare in Ukraine show how important it is to quickly respond, and immediately shut down, such attacks, Pentagon experts said Wednesday. But the U.S. needs to get much better at its own EW rapid response, they said during the C4ISRNET Conference Wednesday — and can learn a lot from how the private sector has handled these situations. Brig. Gen. Tad Clark, director of the Air Force’s electromagnetic spectrum superiority directorate, said modern wars will increasingly involve electromagnetic warfare, particularly to shape the battlefield when conflicts begin. Dave Tremper, director of electronic warfare for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, pointed to SpaceX’s ability last month to swiftly stymie a Russian effort to jam its Starlink satellite broadband service, which was keeping Ukraine connected to the Internet. SpaceX founder Elon Musk steered thousands of Starlink terminals to Ukraine after an official sent him a tweet asking for help keeping the besieged country online. “The next day [after reports about the Russian jamming effort hit the media], Starlink had slung a line of code and fixed it,” Tremper said. “And suddenly that [Russian jamming attack] was not effective anymore. From [the] EW technologist’s perspective, that is fantastic … and how they did that was eye-watering to me.” The government, on the other hand, has a “significant timeline to make those types of corrections” as it muddles through analyses of what happened, decides how to fix it and gets a contract in place for the fix. “We need to be able to have that agility,” Tremper said. “We need to be able to change our electromagnetic posture to be able to change, very dynamically, what we’re trying to do without losing capability along the way.” Redundancy is also critical so the U.S. could keep operating on another system if an EW attack succeeded at knocking one out, Tremper said. The U.S. needs to think a lot more innovatively when it comes to building new EW equipment, Clark said. It won’t be enough to just buy upgraded versions of legacy systems, he said — the U.S. has to come up with new systems that allow for much greater resilience and speed. This includes incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into next-generation systems to be able to respond faster, he said. Increased use of digital engineering can also help the military model new equipment with a computer and work out the kinks before going through the time-consuming typical acquisition and testing process. Clark said the Air Force’s in-development Compass Call, the EC-37B, is a prime example of how digital engineering is transforming how the service approaches new electromagnetic warfare capabilities. Software coders and engineers are working with Compass Call operators on the ground to figure out creative ways to jam enemy signals, Clark said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has taught the U.S. a great deal about the sophistication and reliability of Russian equipment, they said, and their troops’ ability to carry out missions in a synchronized way. In particular, Tremper said, it has shown how important it is to properly train the personnel assigned to carry out electromagnetic warfare operations. Trying to carry out EW while moving forward inside the territory you’re invading, and not in a secure location, makes it even trickier. “It’s a very hard problem, if you don’t have well-trained operators,” Tremper said. “The degree of coordination and synchronization of these types of operations is such that the undertrained operator will have a harder time pulling off those types of events successfully.” Tremper said the Pentagon expected a “much stronger” EW showing from Russia — but cautioned that isn’t to say all of Russia’s efforts have failed.",World/Defense News,SpaceX shut down a Russian electromagnetic warfare attack in Ukraine last month — and the Pentagon is taking notes,https://news.yahoo.com/spacex-shut-down-russian-electromagnetic-190254556.html
4/21/2022,"Last Wednesday in Stockholm, the prime ministers of Sweden and Finland, countries where neutrality and military non-alliance are deeply woven into their cultures, shocked the world by issuing a joint statement that, thanks to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they were considering applying for membership in NATO. “There is a before and after Feb. 24,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters in reference to Russia’s latest military incursion in Ukraine. “The security landscape has completely changed.” “We have to be prepared for all kinds of actions from Russia,” Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said, adding that Finland would decide about applying to NATO in a matter of weeks. While both countries had already closed off their skies to Russian air traffic, the announcement about NATO membership further risked the wrath of the Kremlin, which has repeatedly threatened both against joining the 30-member military alliance. Over the last week in Sweden, radios, portable generators and camping stoves are flying off shelves as its 10.4 million citizens begin stocking up on canned food, water, flashlights and matches in preparation for anticipated acts of Russian sabotage. In Finland, where the government has stockpiled enough grains and fuels in strategic reserves to last at least five months, they’re expecting more cyberattacks like those that hit the ministries of defense and foreign relations on April 8, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the Finnish Parliament via video. Like the Swedes, the 5.5 million residents of Finland believe that Russia will soon target its infrastructure, including the internet and electrical grid, and Russian violations of the airspace in both countries are already on the rise. In response to their public declarations of interest in NATO membership, Moscow has renewed its threats to retaliate and bolster nearby ground and air forces, deploying “significant naval forces in the Gulf of Finland,” according to Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council. ""There can be no more talk of any nuclear-free status for the Baltic [Sea],” Medvedev added, a threat dismissed by analysts in the region as saber rattling, since tiny Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic, is widely believed to already hold nuclear weapons. “If you’re talking about large nuclear weapons, it doesn’t really matter if the bases literally are in the Baltic Sea or the Gulf of Finland, if it is in Kaliningrad or if they’re 500 miles away,” Charly Salonius-Pasternak, security and defense analyst at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs in Helsinki, told Yahoo News. The addition of Finland and Sweden to the Western military alliance would not only expand NATO territory by 300,000 square miles toward the northeast — in blatant defiance of Putin’s demands last December to shrink NATO’s footprint — but it would also roughly double NATO's borders with Russia to nearly 1,600 miles. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who called Sweden and Finland “our closest partners,” said in early April that he expected all NATO “allies will welcome them.” He added, “We know that they can easily join this alliance if they decide to apply.” “These are two really capable military powers, who are far more capable than the size of the countries would suggest,” Ivo Daalder, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, told Yahoo News with regard to Sweden and Finland. And they would also boost military capabilities in the Baltic Sea, home to three small NATO countries — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — whose defense has always posed a problem for the alliance, Daalder said. The likely accession of Finland and Sweden is “a really big deal” for NATO as well as Finland and Sweden themselves, Daalder added. “Sweden has been neutral or [militarily nonaligned] since 1814,” he noted. And Finland, which became independent from Russia over a century ago, “has never wanted to be part of any alliance since it became independent in 1917. ... But for the invasion of Ukraine, this wouldn’t have happened.” Indeed, even three months ago the prospect of Sweden and Finland joining NATO didn’t appear in the cards. Finnish Prime Minister Marin said in January that her country was “very unlikely” to join NATO under her watch, a sentiment that was echoed by Sweden’s defense minister. Two weeks ago, however, Marin did an about-face, proclaiming that “Russia is not the neighbor we thought it was.” The fact that “Russia seems willing to invade, on completely false pretenses, its neighbors that don’t belong to NATO” sparked a realization among Finns, who have long tried to placate the Kremlin, Salonius-Pasternak said. Specifically, when the citizens of Finland, which fought the Soviet Union after it invaded in 1939, watched Russia’s savage attacks unfold in Ukraine, something fundamental changed in their logic. After Russia’s atrocities in Bucha became clear earlier this month, Finnish public support for joining NATO soared to 68%. Local thinking, Salonius-Pasternak said, switched from “If we join NATO, Russia may get annoyed and do something bad to us” to “They may do something bad anyway, so why not seek a form of deterrence that is completely unavailable to them?” “What happened,” Salonius-Pasternak added, “was the Finnish population drew some conclusions which forced the hand of the Finnish political elite, and thereby also the Swedish.” Gunilla Herolf, senior associate research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs in Stockholm, agreed that Finland is blazing the trail toward NATO membership. “Finland has been taking the lead,” she told Yahoo News. “After public support for NATO went up so much in Finland, people in Sweden started to realize that it’s very likely that Finland will join, and that made public opinion go up in Sweden as well.” The two countries have a very close relationship, she added, which only intensified in 2014 when Russia invaded Ukraine the first time, annexing Crimea. Herolf expects that the extensive cooperation of Sweden and Finland with NATO, with which they often perform joint military exercises and whose forces they fought alongside in the Balkans and Afghanistan, will help speed up the process of applying for membership. But there’s a risk: While Finland and Sweden are expected to apply in the coming weeks, their acceptance into the military alliance depends on unanimous agreement from all 30 of NATO’s current members, a process that could take months. “That invitation needs to be ratified by all 30 current members, and that means that the U.S. Senate will have to ratify it, and 29 parliaments will have to ratify it,” said Daalder. While he doesn’t foresee any problems, he added, “you never know — maybe a parliament gets dissolved and therefore there’s no parliament to ratify it.” Until their membership is ratified, Finland and Sweden will remain vulnerable. If Russia attacked either before they were admitted to the alliance, neither could invoke Article 5, the NATO clause that states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Another potential snag is the upcoming presidential election in France. Right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen, currently trailing incumbent President Emmanuel Macron by at least 7 points, has vowed to cut France’s military involvement with NATO. “While the ratification process among the 30 NATO members could happen quickly,"" said Daalder, “the problem is it needs to go quickly in 30 countries. The real question is, what do you do in the meantime?” Once Finland and Sweden are officially invited to apply to NATO, Daalder said, even before their membership is approved by member countries, “the president of the United States should make clear that until such time as these countries are formally part of NATO, that we, the United States, hopefully with partner countries, are committed to defending their security.” In the meantime, both Finland and Sweden are boosting their armed forces and ramping up annual spending on civil defense and arms. The Finnish government in February ordered 64 F-35s from Lockheed Martin, with a price tag of over $9 billion. Sweden, where the 2021 defense budget was around $7 billion, is expected to raise that amount to about $11 billion, roughly the 2% of GDP required of NATO members.",World/Yahoo News,"Finland and Sweden, moving toward possible NATO membership, brace for Russian backlash",https://news.yahoo.com/finland-and-sweden-moving-toward-possible-nato-membership-brace-for-russian-backlash-215223249.html

4/21/2022,"MBS erupted at US national security advisor Jake Sullivan when the two men met for the first time last year, WSJ reported. The crown prince started ""shouting"" at Sullivan after he brought up Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder. Khashoggi was assassinated in 2018, and the CIA later concluded that MBS personally ordered his killing. Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman erupted at national security advisor Jake Sullivan during a meeting last year when Sullivan brought up the assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. That's according to The Wall Street Journal, which reported that the argument happened last September, when the two men met for the first time since President Joe Biden took office. Although the crown prince wanted to strike a ""relaxed tone"" for their meeting, he ""ended up shouting at Mr. Sullivan after he raised the 2018 killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" the newspaper reported. ""The prince told Mr. Sullivan he never wanted to discuss the matter again,"" people familiar with the discussion told The Journal. The crown prince also said that the US ""could forget about its request to boost oil production."" Khashoggi, 59, a longtime Washington Post columnist known for his criticism of the Saudi kingdom, was assassinated and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, after going there to get paperwork for his upcoming marriage. The CIA concluded a little over a month later that Prince Mohammed, also known as MBS, had personally ordered Khashoggi's murder. The Journal's report on Tuesday detailed at length the deterioration of the US's relationship with Saudi Arabia over the last several years. Those divisions have deepened since Russia launched a full-scale, unprovoked invasion in Ukraine in February. The US and other Western nations have pushed the kingdom to increase its production of crude oil to offset rising oil prices and squeeze Russia's ability to finance its war. But, The Journal reported, Saudi Arabia has refused to do so thus far and its interests remain aligned with Russia's. This story is breaking. Check back for updates.

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. A final coroner's report has revealed new details including the cause of death of Oscar-nominated director and producer Jean-Marc Vallée. Vallée, who was known for films like ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and the hit HBO series ""Big Little Lies,"" was found dead at his cabin outside of Quebec City on Dec. 25, 2021. The 58-year-old Montreal-native was believed to have been preparing to entertain guests for the holidays when he died from what's now been determined as ""a fatal arrhythmia secondary to severe coronary atherosclerosis."" According to Deadline, Vallée's death was particularly shocking since he abstained from alcohol and was ""a fitness fanatic."" A preliminary report received by the director's family on Dec. 31 stated that ""Mr. Vallée’s death was not caused by the intervention of another party, a voluntary act, or a known disease."" ""Testimonials of friendship, esteem and respect for our father and for his work are still coming from around the world,"" his sons Alex and Émile Vallée said in a statement following his passing. ""We are sincerely grateful and we hope that his creativity will continue to serve as inspiration and guidance to the people in this industry that he was so passionate about."" Read on to learn more about cardiac arrhythmias, signs and symptoms, and how they can be prevented. A cardiac arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat. If you have an arrhythmia, your heart may beat slower or faster than what is considered normal. ""A cardiac arrhythmia is serious because the condition can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms or you associate your symptoms with something else,"" a representative from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI) tells Yahoo Canada. ""Oftentimes, doctors only spot the condition during a physical exam."" There are several conditions that might cause your heart to beat abnormally, and treatment depends on the cause. However, it can be normal to have a fast or slow heart rate. For example, the heart rate may slow down during sleep or increase while exercising. ""Generally, cardiac arrhythmias are grouped by the speed of the heart rate,"" the UOHI source, who asked to not be named, says. ""A tachycardia arrhythmia is a fast heartbeat (resting heart rate is greater than 100 beats per minute), and a bradycardia arrhythmia is a slow heartbeat (resting heart rate is less than 60 beats per minute)."" ""Cardiac arrhythmias may feel like a racing or fluttering heart and can be harmless. But some arrhythmias may be aggravating and life-threatening,"" they add. Cardiac arrhythmias occur when the electrical signals that coordinate heartbeats don't work properly. This causes the heart to beat too slow, too fast, or a combination of both. ""Arrhythmias can also be caused by high blood pressure, electrolyte imbalances, irritable heart tissue, injury from a heart attack, changes in the heart muscle or coronary atherosclerosis,"" the UOHI source continues. Coronary atherosclerosis, the secondary cause of Vallée's passing, kills 70,000 Canadians each year, per the University of Ottawa. Aside from cancer, it is the second-leading cause of death. The UOHI representative explains that ""coronary atherosclerosis is triggered by plaque buildup in the the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart and the human body. Over time, the plaque build-up narrows arteries resulting in adverse health effects."" Cardiac arrhythmias may not cause any symptoms or warning signs. However, a medical professional can diagnose an irregular heartbeat while performing diagnostic tests, taking a pulse, or listening to a patient's heart. ""Although symptoms can be silent, the signs of a cardiac arrhythmia include shortness of breath, chest pounding or discomfort, weakness or fatigue, a fluttering in the chest, and feeling dizzy or lightheaded,"" says the UOHI source. ""Other common symptoms may include sweating, fainting and anxiety, which is why the condition can easily be mistaken for something else."" If you have symptoms of an arrhythmia, or if you feel like your heart is beating too quickly, too slowly, or is skipping a beat, you should make an appointment to see a doctor or a cardiologist. There are a variety of factors that increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and irregular heartbeats. If you have certain medical conditions including coronary artery disease, congenital heart disease, thyroid disease, high blood pressure or sleep apnea, you may be more at risk of developing the condition. ""Excessive use of stimulants such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine or drugs can also cause your heart to beat faster or slower than normal and may lead to the development of more serious arrhythmias or death due to ventricular fibrillation,"" explains the UOHI source. Treatment can depend on the severity and type of the arrhythmia. Once identified, there are various treatment options including catheter or pacemaker procedures, medication and surgery to control or eliminate fast, slow or irregular heartbeats. These treatment options are usually very successful. Implementing heart-healthy lifestyle changes can help prevent heart damage that can trigger certain cardiac arrhythmias. Examples include exercising regularly, getting adequate sleep, and eating a healthy diet that's low in salt and fats and rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. ""I would also recommend quitting smoking, reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, and monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels,"" explains the source.

Researchers from the Alfred Hospital and Baker Heart Institute in Australia have reported that drinking coffee is associated with a lower risk of heart disease and dangerous heart rhythms as well as with living longer.

4/21/2022,"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it. One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64. And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents. With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post. DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said. A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain. “He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said. “There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said. Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline. “What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said. “How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added. Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said. “I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.” DeHart said he paid what he should have owed. It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

4/21/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Russian defence ministry has proposed that relatives of soldiers killed in Ukraine should have to apply to military rather than civilian authorities for compensation payments, imposing an extra level of secrecy around its war losses. Russia already classifies military deaths as state secrets even in times of peace and has not updated its official casualty figures in Ukraine for nearly four weeks. In its proposal, the defence ministry asked that the benefits paid to the families of fallen soldiers no longer be overseen by civilian officials but handled by enlistment offices instead. That move is designed to ""limit the circle of people"" with information on Russian troops killed in Ukraine, it said. The proposal appeared on a government legal information website. It was unclear when it would be reviewed by the government. The ministry said on March 25 that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded since Moscow launched what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine on Feb. 24. It has provided no update on military casualties since then, but the Kremlin has spoken of ""significant losses"". Ukraine and Western governments have said they believe Russian casualties are many times higher.

4/21/2022,"The images and video began circulating on social media almost immediately. When reports first emerged last week of an explosion on the Moskva, Russia's flagship in the Black Sea, posts purporting to be of the carnage and aftermath soon followed. The ship was both a symbol of Russia’s strength as well as a key cog in its military operations. Its sinking and the unverified circumstances around the explosion — Ukraine said it hit the ship with missiles, Russia said ammunition damaged the ship and it sank in a stormy sea — quickly led to an appetite for anything that might show what really happened. Most of the claims were quickly debunked by professional news organizations and amateur analysts, often referred to as the open-source intelligence community (OSINT for short). In some, the ship didn’t match the Moskva’s profile. Others were quickly found to be old videos. But a couple of pictures that emerged in recent days are different. Images and a short video appeared to show thick black smoke billowing from a warship bearing a striking resemblance to the Moskva. The photos were new. The ship was clearly a Slava-class cruiser, of which the Moskva was one of three. By using archive photos, the NBC News Social Newsgathering team matched the shape and infrastructure of the ship — including its dome-shaped fire-control radar, helicopter hangar, helipad and distinctive dark gray paint. Some lingering doubts remain. NBC News could not determine who originally took the video or images, or why they are only being shared now. The Pentagon has also said the images cannot be verified. But experts who spoke with NBC News said they believed that the photos, assuming they have not been doctored, showed the Moskva. The photos showed no signs of alteration. James Stavridis, a retired U.S. Navy admiral, said there was a high chance that they showed the Russian vessel. “In today’s world, with the ability to produce deep fakes of just about anything, I wouldn’t bet my life on an assessment,” he said. “I would say this is in fact the Moskva. It certainly appears to be a Slava-class cruiser. They are utterly distinctive with the missile tubes up forward. No other Slavas or similar ships have been sunk in distress that I know of or can find. Occam’s Razor tells me this is very probably the Slava class cruiser Moskva.” Bradley Martin, a senior policy researcher with the Rand Corp. and a former surface warfare captain in the U.S. Navy, said all available evidence points to the Moskva as the ship in the photo. “There are no other ships of this kind that have been damaged, and the damage is consistent with the reports,” he said in an email. Capt. Patrick Kulakowski, a military professor at the Russia Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, offered a similar assessment. “I don’t know if anything is doctored, but that is a Slava class,” he said. “They only have three of them, and we know that [the other two] are alive and well.” The NBC News Social Newsgathering team also noted that one of the images circulating online showed the ship noticeably leaning portside and that a rescue tugboat could be faintly seen behind the Moskva spraying two streams of water into the air. A low-quality, three-second video also showed a similar scene of the warship on fire, as a tugboat approached the vessel. The recording ended abruptly when a man yells in Russian: “What the f--- are you doing?”",World/NBC News,Images appear to show carnage of sinking warship Moskva,https://news.yahoo.com/first-images-appear-show-russian-145215054.html
4/21/2022,"Marjorie Taylor Greene is going to appear in court on Friday. The media will be there, too, and she’s furious about it. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg ruled earlier this week that an effort to disqualify the conspiracy theorist from running for reelection over her alleged role in the attack on the Capitol last Jan. 6 can proceed. The group who filed the challenge, Free Speech for People, is alleging that Greene is in violation of the 14th Amendment, which states that if someone took an oath to defend the Constitution and then “engaged in insurrection or rebellion,” they can’t serve in Congress.

Greene seems a little worried, perhaps because she’s built her entire career on pushing lies and unfounded conspiracy theories — from Jewish-funded space lasers starting the California wildfires to the 2020 election being stolen — and has little experience telling the truth, which she’ll now have to do lest she open herself up to perjury charges. “You want to talk about it? It’s a big lie,” she said recently on One America News. “They want to talk about the big lie, this is the big lie and it’s destroying democracy.” Greene grew even more animated about the media presence in the courtroom. “I really hope you guys get a camera in that courtroom,” she continued. “You know what the Democrats and the media are going to do: They’re going to click and cut and paste so they can sell a lie on their networks every night.” Greene talking about “destroying democracy” is pretty rich. Rolling Stone reported last fall that Greene was one of several lawmakers who participated in the planning of the “Stop the Steal” rally that preceded the riot at the Capitol. She’s since valorized those who stormed the Capitol in attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. “If you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants,” she said in October. Greene made the same argument against the media’s presence in the courtroom on The Jennis Ellis Show, hosted by Trump’s former election attorney. “It’s absurd what they are claiming and lying about,” she said on Tuesday. “They’re going to allow the press in the courtroom. They’re going to allow the whole thing to be videoed live. … You know what that’s going to look like. The Democrats and the nasty mainstream media … are going to be able to twist and turn and clip out any little piece they want.” Marge getting scared for court Friday: “They’re going to allow the press in the courtroom. They’re going to allow the whole thing to be videoed live. They’re going to be able to clip out 😁any little piece they want of the horrible things .. they’re going to say about me.” pic.twitter.com/PJq4QpBh6u — Ron Filipkowski 🇺🇦 (@RonFilipkowski) April 19, 2022 Greene tried to block the effort to get her booted from the ballot earlier this month, arguing that the move is unconstitutional while “vigorously” denying that she “aided and engaged in insurrection.” Judge Totenberg didn’t buy it. “This case involves a whirlpool of colliding constitutional interests of public import,” the judge, who was appointed by President Obama, wrote. “The novelty of the factual and historical posture of this case — especially when assessed in the context of a preliminary injunction motion reviewed on a fast track — has made resolution of the complex legal issues at stake here particularly demanding.” U.S. District Court Judge Richard Myers II, who was appointed by Trump, last week ruled in favor of Madison Cawthorn as the North Carolina representative moved to block a similar effort to disqualify him from Congress for his alleged involvement in the events of last Jan. 6. Cawthorn, like Greene, was mentioned in Rolling Stone‘s report about the organization of the rally that preceded the riot. Greene wasn’t as lucky as Cawthorn, but it will likely be hard to prove that she, or any of the other lawmakers who may have helped incite the riot, actually violated the 14th Amendment — even though the evidence against Greene in particular is pretty copious. Regardless, Friday’s testimony could be illuminating. Up to this point, Greene has been free to peddle lies ad infinitum, and because Republican leadership doesn’t seem to care, the only real consequence she’s faced has been getting banned from Twitter. She’ll now have to speak not only under the specter of media scrutiny, but of perjury charges.

4/21/2022,"BANGKOK (AP) — With its ground troops forced to pull back in Ukraine and regroup, and its Black Sea flagship sunk, Russia's military failings are mounting. No country is paying closer attention than China to how a smaller and outgunned force has badly bloodied what was thought to be one of the world's most powerful armies. China, like Russia, has been ambitiously reforming its Soviet-style military and experts say leader Xi Jinping will be carefully parsing the weaknesses exposed by the invasion of Ukraine as they might apply to his own People’s Liberation Army and his designs on the self-governed island of Taiwan. “The big question Xi and the PLA leadership must be asking in light of Russian operations in Ukraine is whether a military that has undergone extensive reform and modernization will be able to execute operations that are far more complex than those Russia has undertaken during its invasion of Ukraine,” said M. Taylor Fravel, director of the security studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Russia's armed forces have undergone an extensive process of reform and investment for more than a decade, with lessons learned in combat in Georgia, Chechnya, Syria and its annexation of Crimea helping guide the process. The Ukrainian invasion, however, has exposed weaknesses from the top down. Experts have been collectively stunned that Russia invaded Ukraine with seemingly little preparation and lack of focus — a campaign along multiple, poorly-coordinated axes that has failed to effectively combine air and land operations. Soldiers have been running out of food, and vehicles have been breaking down. With losses mounting, Moscow has pulled its bloodied forces away from the capital, Kyiv, to regroup. Last week, the guided-missile cruiser Moskva sank after Ukraine said it hit the ship with missiles; Russia blamed the sinking on a fire on board. “It's very hard to see success at any level in the way that Russia has prosecuted the campaign,” said Euan Graham, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies based in Singapore. President Vladimir Putin, who has been closely involved in Russia's military reform, did not even appoint an overall commander for the operation until about a week ago, apparently expecting a quick victory and grossly misjudging Ukrainian resistance, Graham said. “It's a very personal war on his part,” Graham said. “And I think the expectation that this would be a cakewalk is obviously the biggest single failure.” Putin's decisions raise the question of whether he was given accurate assessments of the progress of military reform and Ukrainian abilities, or was just told what he wanted to hear. Xi, also an authoritarian leader who has taken a personal role in China’s military reform, could now be wondering the same, Fravel said. “Xi specifically may also wonder whether he is receiving accurate reports about the PLA’s likely effectiveness in a high intensity conflict,” he said. China has had no recent major conflict by which to gauge its military prowess, having fought its last significant engagement in 1979 against Vietnam, said David Chen, a senior consultant with CENTRA Technology, a U.S.-based government services firm. “The wakeup call for (China’s) Central Military Commission is that there are more unknown factors involved in any such campaign than they may have anticipated,” Chen said. “Russia’s experience in Ukraine has shown that what may seem plausible on paper at the Academy of Military Science or National Defense University becomes much more complicated in the real world.” Xi, the son of a revolutionary commander who spent time in uniform himself, began undertaking military reforms in 2015, three years after assuming leadership of the Central Military Commission. Total troop strength was reduced by 300,000 to just under 2 million, the number of officers cut by a third and a greater emphasis given to non-commissioned officers to lead in the field. China’s military has a tradition of respect for initiative from lower-ranking soldiers dating from its revolutionary origins, said Yue Gang, a Beijing-based military analyst. By contrast, Russian forces in Ukraine have shown weaknesses where decisions have had to be made on the front lines, he said. “Chinese soldiers are encouraged to put forward their thoughts and views when discussing how to fight,” Yue said. China's seven military districts have been reorganized into five theater commands, the number of group armies reduced and the logistics system reorganized to boost efficiency. The ratio of support to combat units was increased and a greater emphasis placed on more mobile and amphibious units. Xi has also sought to end rampant corruption in the military, going after two former top generals shortly after taking power. One was sentenced to life in prison and the other died before his case was concluded. China's military is highly opaque and outside the purview of civilian judges and corruption investigators, so it's difficult to know how thoroughly the organization has been exorcised of practices such as the selling of commissions and kickbacks on defense contracts. For Xi, the military's primary mission remains to protect the ruling Communist Party, and he has followed his predecessors in fighting back hard against efforts to have the military shift its ultimate loyalty to the nation. Xi's overriding political focus could mean the lessons he draws from the Ukraine conflict are off base, Graham said. “Xi Jinping will always apply a political solution because he's not a military specialist or an economic specialist,” Graham said. “I think the military lessons have to go through a political filter, so I'm not sure that China will take the lessons that are abundant and on show for everyone to see.” The stated goal of China's military reform is to “fight and win wars” against a “strong enemy” — a euphemism widely understood to refer to the United States. China has pumped huge amounts of money into new equipment, has initiated more realistic training exercises with force-on-force scenarios, and sought to reform its fighting doctrine by studying American engagements in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Gen. David Berger, the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, said in a forum in Australia last week that Beijing would be watching the Ukraine conflict closely. “I don't know what lessons they will learn but ... they're focused on learning, without a doubt, because they've been doing that for the last 15 years,” he said. Berger stressed the need for strong coalitions in the Pacific as a way to keep China's ambitions toward Taiwan in check. China claims Taiwan as its own, and controlling the island is a key component of Beijing’s political and military thinking. In October, Xi again reiterated that “reunification of the nation must be realized, and will definitely be realized.” Washington’s longstanding policy has been to provide political and military support for Taiwan, while not explicitly promising to defend it from a Chinese attack. Like Putin’s assessment of Ukraine, Xi’s China does not appear to believe that Taiwan would try to put up much of a fight. Beijing routinely blames its problems with the island on a small group of hardcore independence advocates and their American supporters. The entirely state-controlled Chinese media, meanwhile, draws on the imagined narrative that Taiwan would not willingly go to battle against what it describes as their fellow Chinese. Now, the quick response by many nations to impose tough, coordinated sanctions on Russia after its attack on Ukraine, and the willingness to supply Ukraine with high-tech weaponry could make Xi rethink his approach to Taiwan, Fravel said. With “the rapid response by advanced industrialized states, and the unity they have demonstrated, Xi is likely to be more cautious over Taiwan and less emboldened,” he said. Conversely, the Ukraine experience could prompt China to accelerate its timetable on Taiwan with a more limited attack, such as seizing an outlying island, as a real-world test of its own military, Chen said. “A sensible course would be to mature the PLA's joint institutions and procedures through ever more rigorous exercises,” Chen said. “But as the world has witnessed, a central leader with a specific ambition and a shortening timeline may short-circuit the process in reckless fashion.”",World/Associated Press,China looks to learn from Russian failures in Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/china-looks-learn-russian-failures-042629994.html
4/21/2022,"(Updated with Hutchins’ family lawyer statement) Long in the spotlight for Alec Baldwin’s fatal shooting of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins last October, the film’s armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed is now declaring a degree of vindication after a vital safety report’s release Wednesday. “After OSHA’s very comprehensive safety investigation involving numerous interviews and review of documents, it has concluded that production willfully failed to follow national gun safety standards, which caused this tragedy,” Reed’s lawyer Jason Bowles told Deadline on Wednesday. “OSHA found that Hannah Gutierrez Reed was not provided adequate time or resources to conduct her job effectively, despite her voiced concerns,” the Albuquerque, New Mexico-based attorney noted. More from Deadline 'Rust' Production Company Fined Nearly $137,000 For ""Willful & Serious"" Safety Violations: ""An Avoidable Loss Of Life Occurred"" 'Rust' Shooting Report From New Mexico Safety Agency Is ""On Track"" For Release This Week OSHA Investigating Accident On 'Tales Of The Walking Dead' In the damning report, Rust Movie Productions LLC and its management were hit with a maximum $136,793 fine by the New Mexico Occupational Health and Safety Bureau for its “willful and serious” violation of workplace safety procedures during the filming of the indie Western. “Critically, OSHA also determined that production failed to call Hannah in to perform her armorer duties and inspect the firearm right before its use in the impromptu scene with Baldwin,” Bowles continued in his remarks for his client. “As we have stated before, had anyone from Production called Hannah in back into the church before the scene to consult with her, this tragedy would have been prevented. Hannah has also reached out to OSHA recently in an effort to provide her suggestions for changes and improvement of safety standards on sets to avoid a tragic incident in the future.” With various lawsuit filed over the killing of Hutchins — including a wrongful death action from her family against Baldwin, the Rust producers, Reed and other crew members — the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office is still investigating what actually occurred at the Bonanza Creek Ranch set on October 21. As of yet, no one has been charged or arrested for the incident by either the cops of the local D.A. As that probe tightened, Reed herself sued Rust armorer/mentor Seth Kenney and his Albuquerque-based PDQ Arm and Prop in January of this year. Focusing on alleged negligence by Kenney seemingly mixing up live and dummy rounds, the filing in the New Mexico courts also claimed that Props Manager Sarah Zachary wanted to cover up any previous accidents. Reiterating the narrative that Reed’s father Thell Reed, an industry veteran father, has been espousing since mid-November last year that Kenney never returned hundreds of rounds of live ammo to him from another movie they worked on together, the January 12-filed suit also implicitly carried forward the “sabotage” theory that the younger armorer’s attorneys have been espousing for months. Hutchins was killed by a live bullet in a prop gun discharged by Baldwin on October 21, 2021 on the set of Rust near the New Mexico town. “I didn’t pull the trigger,” Baldwin insisted to ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos in a December 2 interview. The 30 Rock actor also told Stephanopoulos, “I have been told by people who are in the know, in terms of even inside the state, that it’s highly unlikely that I would be charged with anything criminally.” “The idea that the person holding the gun and causing it to discharge is not responsible is absurd to me,” Matt Hutchins, Halyna’s husband, told Today‘s Hoda Kotb in an interview on February 24. “Watching him I just felt so angry. I was just so angry to see him talk about her death so publicly in such a detailed way and then to not accept any responsibility after having just described killing her.” On March 11, Baldwin had his lawyers file paperwork seeking arbitration against his fellow Rust producers. Long story short, the multiple Emmy winners desires to invoke a provision in his contract that could indemnify him in all current and future lawsuits, as well as see his legal bills paid. Hutchins family lawyer Brian Panish of Los Angeles-based Panish | Shea | Boyle | Ravipudi called Baldwin’s filing and revelations of personal communications with Matt Hutchins to be “shameful.” He added: “The only action that ended the film’s production was Baldwin’s killing of Halyna Hutchins.” Today, Panish complimented OSHA for their findings and hinted at some of his own. “We are pleased that the NM OSHA report has shed some light on the workplace safety issues that plagued Rust and led to the tragic and fatal events of Oct 21, 2021,” the attorney told Deadline. “Our own investigation has found overwhelming evidence of recklessness and negligence on the part of the Rust production team and others.” Best of Deadline 2022 Awards Season Calendar - Dates For The Emmys, Tonys & More Awards Season Red Carpet Photos: Grammys, Oscars, SAG Awards & More Spring Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

4/21/2022,"He might secretly be the world’s richest person, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is also the world’s greatest value destroyer. The International Monetary Fund estimates that Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine will lower world economic growth by eight-tenths of a percentage point this year and two-tenths next year. That might not sound like a lot, but given the size of the world economy, it amounts to about $935 billion in lost output, roughly equivalent to zeroing out the entire economy of Turkey or the Netherlands. The toll could easily top $1 trillion if the war drags on or escalates. This is the destruction caused by one man demanding the ruination of a large, peaceful and productive country. It’s not an unstoppable virus, a complex financial contagion or an unforeseen natural disaster. The cost of Putin’s fanaticism is obviously acute in Ukraine, which is suffering thousands of deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage to civilian infrastructure. But Putin’s war is raising the cost of fuel, grain and other vital products literally everywhere. It will cost lives and lower living standards in dozens of nations nowhere near the battlefields. Financial markets have adjusted to Putin’s mayhem, which is both good and bad. It’s good because a resilient global economy lumbers forward. Sanctions on Russia have forced workarounds in the markets for oil, natural gas, and other Russian minerals and products that are now in limited supply or wholly unavailable. Five million Ukrainian refugees in Europe and elsewhere — many displaced by Putin deliberately — are straining relief systems. The risk of a broader war between Putin and the NATO alliance is real and terrifying. Yet markets are patching themselves up and a Putin recession seems unlikely. [Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or send in your thoughts.] It's bad because functional markets may relegate Russia’s violent crusade to background noise and blunt the urgency for all nations that seek prosperity to defeat Putin, now. The United States and many nations in Europe and elsewhere have hit Russia with tough sanctions that will hinder its military power, over time. But those sanctions could go further, and they haven’t mainly because some European leaders feel they can’t shut off Russian energy imports without damaging their own economies too much. Some Western nations also fear that giving Ukraine advanced weaponry, such as tanks and fighter jets, might lead Putin to strike back directly at the donor countries. Yet the West is now at a point where it can bear the risk and cost of confronting Putin, or face him down later at multiples of the present cost. There may never be a better opportunity to defang Putin. Russian forces spectacularly failed to capture Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, and impose a puppet government. They retreated from central Ukraine in disarray, exposing vast holes in a military looted from top to bottom, like the entire Russian economy. Old, neglected equipment broke down routinely. Undisciplined troops employed lazy tactics. Broken supply lines left units short of food and fuel. Intercepted phone calls revealed panicked Russian conscripts desperate to escape and, in some cases, refusing to fight. In southern Ukraine, coastal defense troops sank the Russian navy’s Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, destroying a $750 million fighting platform with two missiles costing perhaps a couple million dollars. Putin’s military may be more vulnerable than at any time during his two-decade rule. Despite that, Russian forces now seem to be launching a new campaign to carve off as much of eastern and southern Ukraine as they can get. At some point, Putin may seek a “peace” settlement that leaves Russia in control of whatever territory it can take and keep. There can be no peace with Putin. The Ukraine invasion is at least Putin’s fourth attempt in 15 years to take neighboring territory with force and kluge together some remnants of the old USSR. Putin’s territorial gains to date would seal off Ukraine’s access to ports on the Sea of Azov, and he probably aims to capture Ukraine’s Black Sea coastline as well, leaving it no seaports to the outside world. If Putin could accomplish that, he would have military force on the border of tiny Moldova, where he also has territorial ambitions. Moldova isn’t a NATO member, but it borders Romania, which is. Russian missile strikes deep into western Ukraine, just miles from the border with NATO-member Poland, show Putin is willing to cut it close and risk an errant attack on a NATO member, which would oblige the alliance to respond. Nobody should assume Putin would stop in Ukraine, if the war ends with Russian territorial gains. He’d continue to claw for turf and military advantage. China’s communist rulers, meanwhile, are watching closely, to see if democratic powers have the mettle and attention span to stop the sort of aggression they may someday attempt in Taiwan or other parts of Asia. The Western goal at this point should be a complete Ukrainian victory, with all Russian forces out of the country. Leave Putin in power in Russia; regime change is a reckless goal. NATO shouldn’t send troops, but Western nations should supply everything short of that and maximize the economic pressure on Russia, to end Putin’s medieval adventurism once and for all. On April 19, a Stanford University working group published a list of several dozen specific recommendations for cutting off the cash Putin uses to fund his military. The ultimate goal should be a complete ban on Russian oil, coal and natural gas products, Russia’s main source of capital. Since that would be difficult for some nations to do quickly, interim measures could include tariffs on Russian energy products that would force Russia to cut the underlying price to remain competitive, reducing the proceeds going back to Russia. Importing nations could also require energy payments be held in escrow accounts until the Ukraine war ends. The Stanford group also calls for designating Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism, which would trigger other types of sanctions. As for military aid, Eliot Cohen of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies argues that the United States should boost the value of materiel support for Ukraine from several billion dollars to tens of billions, and include heavy weapons that could be decisive on the battlefield, such as tanks and artillery. The Biden administration is moving in that direction, but Cohen, writing in the Atlantic, says the pivot is too slow, given that “decisive action is urgently required to tip the balance between a costly success and a calamity.” The fastest way to help Ukrainian forces is with more Soviet-style equipment they already know how to use. Most of this would have to come from eastern and central European nations such as Poland, Lithuania and the Czech Republic, which are already sending some such weapons. The U.S. role is to facilitate delivery and help these nations backfill donated equipment with newer systems, covertly if necessary. Western defense contractors surely won’t object. Every path involves risk. If Europe and the United States put everything they have into ejecting Russian forces from Ukraine, Putin could lash out with chemical or biological attacks or even a nuclear strike of some kind. But if he succeeds even partially in Ukraine, he could do the same thing later, when he’s closer to NATO borders. Tighter limits on Russian energy imports would be tough on European nations such as Germany and Italy that can’t readily replace the energy. But better to do it on their own terms now, than to let Putin dictate the terms later. Nobody wants to bear the cost of Putin’s war, but there will always be another Putin war and the cost will only go up.

4/21/2022,"STORY: Russia said on Wednesday it had conducted a test launch of its Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missile, a new addition to its nuclear arsenal which President Vladimir Putin said would make Moscow's enemies 'stop and think'. Russia released footage of what it says shows the test launch of the new missile. The Sarmat has been under development for years, and its test-launch is not a surprise for the West, but it comes at a moment of extreme global tension over the war in Ukraine. PUTIN: ""The new complex has the highest tactical and technical characteristics and can penetrate all modern anti-missile defenses. It has no analogues in the world and will not have any for a long time to come."" The missile test came as Ukrainian forces were making their last stand in the besieged city of Mariupol, after a Russian ultimatum to surrender or die expired on Wednesday. Once a prosperous port of 400,000 people and now a devastated wasteland, Russia was hitting the city's last main Ukrainian stronghold - the Azovstal steel plant, with bunker-buster bombs, Kyiv said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 1,000 civilians remained trapped in the plant. In a video posted online on Wednesday, Ukrainian commander Serhiy Volyna - still fighting in Mariupol - urged the international community to help evacuate wounded Ukrainian fighters and their families. ""This is our appeal to the world. It may be our last. We may have only a few days or hours left. The enemy units are dozens of times larger than ours, they have dominance in the air, in artillery, in ground troops, in equipment and in tanks."" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned of a grim aftermath once the fighting ends. ""What the world witnessed just a couple of weeks ago when the receding Russian tide from Bucha revealed what was left in its wake in terms of death, destruction and atrocities. We can only anticipate that one: this tide at some point also recedes from Mariupol, we are going to see far worse, If that's possible to imagine."" A small convoy of buses carried some civilians out of Mariupol Wednesday – but Ukrainian officials say the number of people evacuated was far fewer than planned.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Russia tests nuclear-capable missile,https://news.yahoo.com/russia-tests-nuclear-capable-missile-232259745.html
4/21/2022,"CHERNOBYL, Ukraine (AP) — Here in the dirt of one of the world’s most radioactive places, Russian soldiers dug trenches. Ukrainian officials worry they were, in effect, digging their own graves. Thousands of tanks and troops rumbled into the forested Chernobyl exclusion zone in the earliest hours of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, churning up highly contaminated soil from the site of the 1986 accident that was the world's worst nuclear disaster. For more than a month, some Russian soldiers bunked in the earth within sight of the massive structure built to contain radiation from the damaged Chernobyl nuclear reactor. A close inspection of their trenches was impossible because even walking on the dirt is discouraged. As the 36th anniversary of the April 26, 1986, disaster approaches and Russia’s invasion continues, it’s clear that Chernobyl — a relic of the Cold War — was never prepared for this. With scientists and others watching in disbelief from afar, Russian forces flew over the long-closed plant, ignoring the restricted airspace around it. They held personnel still working at the plant at gunpoint during a marathon shift of more than a month, with employees sleeping on tabletops and eating just twice a day. Even now, weeks after the Russians left, “I need to calm down,"" the plant's main security engineer, Valerii Semenov, told The Associated Press. He worked 35 days straight, sleeping only three hours a night, rationing cigarettes and staying on even after the Russians allowed a shift change. “I was afraid they would install something and damage the system,” he said in an interview. Workers kept the Russians from the most dangerous areas, but in what Semenov called the worst situation he has seen in his 30 years at Chernobyl, the plant was without electricity, relying on diesel generators to support the critical work of circulating water for cooling the spent fuel rods. “It was very dangerous to act in this way,” said Maksym Shevchuck, the deputy head of the state agency managing the exclusion zone. He was scared by it all. Russia’s invasion marks the first time that occupying a nuclear plant was part of a nation's war strategy, said Rebecca Harms, former president of the Greens group in the European Parliament, who has visited Chernobyl several times. She called it a “nightmare” scenario in which “every nuclear plant can be used like a pre-installed nuclear bomb.” A visit to the exclusion zone, more desolate than usual, found that the invasion risked a catastrophe worse than the original explosion and fire at Chernobyl that sent radioactive material into the atmosphere and became a symbol of the Soviet Union’s stumbling final years. Billions of dollars were spent by the international community, including Russia, to stabilize and secure the area. Now authorities are working with Ukraine’s defense ministry on ways to protect Chernobyl’s most critical places. At the top of the list are anti-drone systems and anti-tank barriers, along with a system to protect against warplanes and helicopters. None of it will matter much if Russian President Vladimir Putin resorts to nuclear weapons, which Shevchuck says he can't rule out anymore. “I understand they can use any kind of weapon and they can do any awful thing,” he said. Chernobyl needs special international protection with a robust U.N. mandate, Harms said. As with the original disaster, the risks are not only to Ukraine but to nearby Belarus and beyond. “It depends from where the wind blows,” she said. After watching thousands of Soviet soldiers work to contain the effects of the 1986 accident, sometimes with no protection, Harms and others were shocked at the Russian soldiers’ disregard for safety, or their ignorance, in the recent invasion. Some soldiers even stole highly radioactive materials as souvenirs or possibly to sell. “I think from movies they have the imagination that all dangerous small things are very valuable,” Shevchuck said. He believes hundreds or thousands of soldiers damaged their health, likely with little idea of the consequences, despite plant workers' warnings to their commanders. “Most of the soldiers were around 20 years old,” he said. “All these actions proves that their management, and in Russia in general, human life equals like zero.” The full extent of Russia’s activities in the Chernobyl exclusion zone is still unknown, especially because the troops scattered mines that the Ukrainian military is still searching for. Some have detonated, further disturbing the radioactive ground. The Russians also set several forest fires, which have been put out. Ukrainian authorities can’t monitor radiation levels across the zone because Russian soldiers stole the main server for the system, severing the connection on March 2. The International Atomic Energy Agency said Saturday it still wasn’t receiving remote data from its monitoring systems. The Russians even took Chernobyl staffers’ personal radiation monitors. In the communications center, one of the buildings in the zone not overgrown by nature, the Russians looted and left a carpet of shattered glass. The building felt deeply of the 1980s, with a map on a wall still showing the Soviet Union. Someone at some point had taken a pink marker and traced Ukraine’s border. In normal times, about 6,000 people work in the zone, about half of them at the nuclear plant. When the Russians invaded, most workers were told to evacuate immediately. Now about 100 are left at the nuclear plant and 100 are elsewhere. Semenov, the security engineer, recalled the Russians checking the remaining workers for what they called radicals. “We said, ‘Look at our documents, 90% of us are originally from Russia,'” he said. “But we’re patriots of our country,"" meaning Ukraine. When the Russians hurriedly departed March 31 as part of a withdrawal from the region that left behind scorched tanks and traumatized communities, they took more than 150 Ukrainian national guard members into Belarus. Shevchuck fears they’re now in Russia. In their rush, the Russians gave nuclear plant managers a choice: Sign a document saying the soldiers had protected the site and there were no complaints, or be taken into Belarus. The managers signed. One protective measure the Russians did appear to take was leaving open a line routing communications from the nuclear plant through the workers’ town of Slavutych and on to authorities in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. It was used several times, Shevchuck said. “I think they understood it should be for their safety,” he said. The IAEA said Tuesday the plant is now able to contact Ukraine’s nuclear regulator directly. Another Ukrainian nuclear plant, at Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine, remains under Russian control. It is the largest in Europe. Shevchuck, like other Ukrainians, has had it with Putin. “We’re inviting him inside the new safe confinement shelter,” he said. “Then we will close it.” ___ Follow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,Russia's Chernobyl seizure seen as nuclear risk 'nightmare',https://news.yahoo.com/russias-chernobyl-seizure-seen-nuclear-062146772.html
4/21/2022,"Moscow's mayor says 200,000 Russians in the city are likely to soon be without work. Hundreds of Western companies have distanced themselves from Russia, creating a dearth in jobs. Some global firms pledged to continue paying their local workers, though it's unclear for how long. Moscow's mayor said on Monday that hundreds of thousands of city residents could lose their jobs as Western companies suspended or pulled their operations from Russia. ""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post. In the post, Sobyanin said Moscow had approved an employment-support program worth 3.36 billion rubles, or roughly $41 million, that would supply temporary jobs or training to those without work. Sobyanin wrote that about 58,000 employees were expected to benefit from the program and that Russia would provide a monthly allowance for children and loans for small and medium-size businesses. Sobyanin's comments came as Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to deny Western sanctions had affected Russia's economy. ""We can now confidently say that such policy (of sanctions) towards Russia has failed,"" he said on Monday. ""The economic blitzkrieg strategy didn't work. Moreover, the initiators themselves couldn't get away with the sanctions."" More than 750 companies have publicly announced that they will cut operations in Russia to some degree since the invasion of Ukraine began, according to the Yale School of Management. Some companies have pledged to continue paying their Russian workers while they're closed in the country, though it's unclear how long they plan to sustain their support. McDonald's, one of the first major businesses to withdraw from Russia, said its store closures in the country cost the company $50 million a month because it kept its about 62,000 local workers on the payroll. Some of its locations are still open because the franchisees who own and operate those restaurants have refused to close, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Sobyanin's post indicated that Moscow was still grappling with a long list of crises. City authorities will discuss in the next two weeks how the capital will maintain its stock of medicines without imports and how it will keep its hospitality industry afloat, he wrote. ""There is a lot of work to be done, the results of which will appear only in a few years,"" Sobyanin wrote.

4/21/2022,"On Wednesday, the Florida Senate voted 23 to 16 to eliminate the Reedy Creek Improvement District, dealing a major blow to Disney and by extension, taxpayers in Central Florida. The district has about a billion dollars in outstanding bonds that need to be dealt with. That burden, as state lawmakers admitted, will fall on local taxpayers. “The procedures that we have will transfer that indebtedness to the general-purpose local governments,” said Sen. Jennifer Bradley (R–Clay County), the bill’s sponsor in the Florida Senate. The billion dollars in bonds that Reedy Creek holds will mature as late as 2036. About 20% are revenue bonds, which will be backed by payments for services like utilities. The remaining 80% are general obligation bonds, backed by faith and credit in the district, which is on the verge of dissolution. READ: What would dissolving Disney’s Reedy Creek mean for local taxpayers? “Those are issued to creditors on the promise that the district will continue to exist and will be able to pay those obligations, of course, state law says that those bonds will be assumed by the counties but just because state law says that you really must dig in to see what is in those agreements,” said Joe Bishop-Henchman, vice president of policy at the National Taxpayers Union. “You don’t really know what’s in the fine print of all of these agreements.” In 2008 when AIG went out of business, its bonds had to be paid immediately. The bonds that were taken out by Reedy Creek could be the same, and if so, that payment would fall on the county. READ: DeSantis: Florida lawmakers to consider ending Disney’s self-governing power during special session In questioning during the bill’s lone committee stop in the Senate in Tallahassee, state lawmakers admitted they do not know who would absorb the debt or how soon. “A billion dollars spread across the population of the county may not be too much, but it’s money, real money,” Bishop-Henchman said. While Orange County would acquire Disney’s land and debt, there wouldn’t be that much additional money for the county. READ: Walt Disney World removes all face mask requirements “If Reedy Creek goes away, the $105 million it collects to operate services goes away,” wrote Orange County Tax Collector Scott Randolph. “That doesn’t just transfer to Orange County because it’s an independent taxing district. However, Orange County then inherits all debt and obligations with no extra funds.” Under state law, Orange County is not allowed to tax Disney extra unless it creates a new special district for Disney. However, to do this, the county would need the property owners inside of Disney (the company) to agree to take back the debt. READ: Groups gather near Disney World to protest company’s stance on Florida education law If the bond debt falls on Orange County, residents can expect to acquire between $2,200 to $2,800 in extra debt for a family of four. The Florida House is expected to pass the measure on Thursday. If signed into law it would dissolve Reedy Creek, as well as five other districts in the state on June 1, 2023.

4/21/2022,"Russia's massive, new offensive in eastern Ukraine reflects Moscow's hope to reverse its battlefield fortunes after a catastrophic seven weeks of war. Russian forces have sharply intensified artillery barrages and airstrikes on Ukrainian positions in the industrial heartland known as the Donbas. A look at the war in Ukraine so far: A FALTERING START Russian troops rolled to the outskirts of the capital of Kyiv days after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24, but the offensive was quickly stymied by staunch resistance. The Russian military incurred heavy personnel and equipment losses, and the failed Kyiv offensive boosted the morale of the Ukrainian forces, allowing its leaders to rally vast international support and secure more weapons from the West. That raised the costs of war for Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin switched the focus to the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian government forces since 2014, after the Kremlin’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. After the retreat from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and other areas in northeastern Ukraine, Russian forces pulled back to the territory of Moscow ally Belarus, as well as areas in western Russia to be rearmed and resupplied for the new offensive. Gen. Alexander Dvornikov was named the new commander for the campaign. At 60, Dvornikov is one of Russia’s most experienced officers, credited with leading Moscow’s forces to success in Syria in a ruthless campaign to shore up President Bashar Assad’s regime in a civil war that saw whole cities flattened and millions displaced. His appointment is seen as reflecting the Kremlin’s awareness to quickly improve poor coordination among various forces that hampered previous efforts THE NEW OFFENSIVE Ukrainian officials said the push began Monday in the Donbas, with Russia trying to press the offensive along an arc-shaped front line stretching for more than 300 miles (480 kilometers) from the northeast to the southeast. In what appeared to be a sharp increase in bombardment Tuesday, Russia said that in the last 24 hours, it struck 60 Ukrainian military facilities with its warplanes and 1,260 with its artillery, while attacking 1,214 troop concentrations. The claims could not be independently verified. The Pentagon described the stepped-up campaign as “shaping operations” setting the stage for a broader offensive. Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who leads Sibylline Ltd., a defense consultancy, said the Russians had escalated bombardments and appeared to be moving gradually to take chunks of territory, focusing mostly on the destruction of Ukraine's most capable forces in the Donbas. “They are hoping to destroy effectively the largest part of the Ukrainian prewar regular army, the best Ukrainian forces,” Crump told The Associated Press. THE RUSSIAN BATTLE PLAN Ukrainian and Western experts expect Russia to try to encircle Ukrainian forces with a pincer movement by advancing from Izyum in the north and Mariupol in the south. Once Russian forces crush the last remaining pocket of Ukrainian resistance at a giant steel mill in Mariupol, they expect that will allow those forces to be freed up to enable the offensive to gain its full tempo. Some predict Russia also may try to use its forces north of Crimea to try to capture the industrial hubs of Zaporizhzhia and Dnipro on the Dnieper River, effectively cutting Ukraine in half. During the eight years of fighting the separatists, the Ukrainian government forces have built multiple rows of trenches along the line of contact that the Russians have failed to penetrate. But Crump and other experts noted that Ukraine was running out of weapons and supplies. “They are firing through a lot of supplies,” he said. “And part of the Russian strategy at this point is to keep probing, to keep searching for ways, keep shaping the battlefield, to get Ukraine to fire the missiles, to use things up, to fire its artillery so they have less supplies left when the bigger blows start to fall sequentially.” Ukraine has pleaded with the West for warplanes, long-range air defense systems, heavy artillery and armor to counter the massive Russian edge in firepower. The Western allies have increased arms supplies and started providing heavy weapons, but it could take time for these to reach Ukrainian troops, which must then learn how to operate them. “New equipment is great, really helpful in many ways, but the problem is you’ve got to learn how to use it,” Crump said, adding that Ukraine may put the new weapons in areas away from the fighting to give troops some practice with them and redeploy Soviet-era weapons to the eastern front. CHALLENGES FOR THE RUSSIANS The Russian offensive will probably face the same logistical challenges its troops encountered early in the war. During the botched attempt to storm Kyiv, Russian convoys stretched along highways to the capital, becoming easy targets for Ukrainian artillery, drones and scouts. The operations in the east could be equally hard, especially as foliage sprouts with the arrival of spring and provides natural cover for guerrilla attacks. Crump said the Russians appear to have learned from their earlier mistakes and tried to avoid long supply lines. They also sought to ensure using railways instead of trucks to carry the bulk of their supplies. While the terrain in the east is flatter and easier for the Russians, Crump noted that rain has made it difficult for off-road movement, constraining maneuvering. “That makes it very hard to be unpredictable and to use tanks to their advantage,” Crump said, adding that Ukrainian defenses will be stretched as the ground dries, offering Russian armor more options to maneuver. While the Russians appeared to be making better use of their assets than at the start of the campaign, he said, “they’ve still got morale problems” and many units ""have been pushed together with little training.” The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War said that while Russian forces may be able to gain ground through the heavy concentration of artillery and larger numbers, its eastern campaign is “unlikely to be dramatically more successful than previous major offensives around Kyiv.” It probably will be hampered by the same “poor coordination, the inability to conduct cross-country operations and low morale that impeded prior offensives,” it said. A PIVOTAL MOMENT After the botched beginning, Putin badly needs a victory in the east to boost the Russians' morale and to try to negotiate an end to hostilities on his terms. Bruised by Western sanctions, Russia lacks financial resources for a long fight. A protracted conflict will multiply the already heavy economic damage and fuel social tensions, eroding the Kremlin’s base of support. Russia already has put its most capable combat units in action, and continued fighting will likely force it to mobilize reservists and send fresh conscripts into combat — moves that could bring broad public discontent. Putin probably hopes that routing Ukrainian forces in the east will allow him to force Kyiv to accept key Kremlin conditions for a halt in fighting — the acknowledgement of Moscow's sovereignty of Crimea and the recognition of the independence of the eastern separatist regions, including areas that had been under Ukrainian control before the war. “I think we’re at this pivotal point where we find out whether we’re going to get a peace, a pause or a protracted conflict,” Crump said. —- Associated Press writer Danica Kirka in London contributed. __ Follow the AP’s coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,EXPLAINER: How Russia's eastern push in Ukraine may unfold,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-russias-eastern-push-ukraine-175044788.html
4/21/2022,"A Washington couple is suing their fertility clinic for destroying their 7 embryos. The clinic admitted an error in embryo storage, causing them to dry out and die. The law firm representing the couple says the fertility industry is less regulated than salons. Kara Seldin-Howell and Kolton Howell always knew they wanted to have kids. But after they married and bought a house, they found conception was more difficult than expected. Their doctor told the Washington-based couple that undergoing in vitro fertilization would be their best bet for starting a family, so they sought consultations with fertility clinics around the country before settling on CNY Fertility Colorado. ""In retrospect, we regret that decision,"" Seldin-Howell said during a press conference Wednesday. After the couple underwent the emotionally and physically-draining process of IVF — including invasive tests, hormone injections, and a surgical procedure to remove Seldin-Howell's eggs before they were mixed in a lab with Howell's sperm — they were elated to learn they'd created seven viable embryos. But just two days later — the day before Mother's Day 2021 — their fertility doctor Dr. Paul Magarelli called to say the embryos had been destroyed. After investigating why, Magarelli told the couple he learned the clinic's lab professionals hadn't put the required oil in the Petri dish, causing the embryos to dry out and die. ""Within a span of 48 hours, we went from being overjoyed that our dream of starting a family was finally coming true, to having that dream ripped away from us,"" Howell said. ""Even after almost a year, I'm still struggling to process what happened."" The couple, represented by Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane & Conway, is suing CNY Fertility Colorado and its parent company CNY Fertility, which operates other fertility clinics in New York, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia, and Canada. They claim negligence, breach of contract, lack of informed consent, and other allegations. CNY Fertility Colorado did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. During the press conference, Seldin-Howell said she and her husband would still like to start a family, but they haven't yet been able to move forward. ""This experience has definitely derailed our journey to becoming parents,"" she said, noting that they've lost valuable time both undergoing IVF and recovering from what happened. While another round of IVF isn't off the table, ""I can't say we aren't afraid of something similar happening,"" Seldin-Howell said. ""We're traumatized by this experience."" She said the only consolation Magarelli gave them was that it wasn't their fault, and that they'll require staffers to ""double-check"" embryo storage protocols in the future. According to their lawyers, any potential compensation offered wasn't sufficient to avoid a lawsuit. ""These embryos were our future babies until CNY fertility carelessly destroyed them,"" Seldin-Howell said. ""I feel robbed of our time, our resources, and the blood, sweat, and tears we invested in this process, and most importantly, robbed of our future and our dream of starting a family."" Peiffer Wolf Carr Kane & Conway says it's handled hundreds of cases of fertility center misconduct. In 2021, a LA couple sued their fertility clinic after an embryo mixup led them to get pregnant with another couple's child while that couple got pregnant with and began raising theirs. That year another family claimed their now-adult daughter was conceived after a fertility doctor used his own sperm in a treatment without consent. Earlier this year, two women alleged they were switched at birth 57 years ago, a discovery made via DNA test. In 2019, Peiffer Wolf firm pushed for national legislation for better oversight of IVF and fertility clinics, which it says are less regulated than barbershops and hair salons. There's no one government agency that oversees the fertility industry, which includes close to 500 clinics and centers. That means no one is managing how fertility centers label tissue such as embryos or disciplining centers that don't comply with professional guidelines, NBC News reported. While a measure of self-regulation comes from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology — a nonprofit whose member organizations are required to advertise truthfully, accurately report outcomes, and to work with nationally accredited labs — errors still happen far too often, Adam Wolf, a partner at Peiffer Wolf, said. ""I'm still baffled by this preventable tragedy,"" he said Wednesday. ""CNY Fertility's response of 'Whoops. We'll try harder next time,' should disturb all of us.""

4/21/2022,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — During its 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran embraced the protest cry of “neither East nor West,” rejecting both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, then locked in the Cold War. The phrase to this day hangs over the doors of Iran’s Foreign Ministry. Russia’s war on Ukraine, however, has exposed just how much Tehran has tilted toward Moscow in recent years as the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers stoked decades-old, hard-line anger at America. Members of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard train on Russian surface-to-air missile systems and aircraft. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi visited Russian President Vladimir Putin on one of his first trips abroad. The war also exposes deeper fault lines even within Iran’s domestic politics. Among ordinary Iranians, there is a great deal of sympathy for Ukraine, a nation that staged a pro-democracy “Orange Revolution” similar to the “Green Revolution” that shook Iran more than a decade ago but was forcefully put down. Iran’s historic enmity with Russia has combined with a wider feeling among some that backing Moscow betrays the Islamic Republic’s often-stated message that it stands against the world’s major powers. “We have to help oppressed people of Ukraine as we do support people of Palestine and Yemen simply because they are targeted by powers,” said Zohreh Ahmadi, a mother of two in downtown Tehran’s Sarcheshmeh neighborhood. “A bullying power is killing children and women in Ukraine.” Iran's state-controlled television network, whose English-language service Press TV describes itself as “the voice of the voiceless,"" hews close to Russian talking points. It used Moscow's euphemistic term “special operation” to describe the war's early days. Stories referencing the killings of civilians in Bucha by Russian forces include headlines falsely describing it as a “fake attack” or “provocation” on Press TV's website. Part of the Iranian government's anger at Ukraine likely stems from the aftermath of the Guard's 2020 shooting down of an Ukrainian airliner, which killed 176 people on board. Tehran denied for days it shot down the plane before saying troops made a mistake after Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq in response for the killing of a top general. Ukraine’s criticism of Iran grew more direct as time went on. That’s something Tehran’s Friday prayer leader, Kazem Sedighi, mentioned in a March sermon after Russia began its war on Ukraine. “In the case of the airplane, Ukraine misbehaved against us and misused it in support to the U.S.,” Sedighi said. He also engaged in the “whataboutism” common in both Iranian and Russian state media — bringing up a separate topic to charge hypocrisy while deflecting the issue at hand. “Wars claim the lives of innocent people in Yemen and Syria but there is huge propaganda over Ukraine and this is racism,” Sedighi said. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, said his nation opposed “war and destruction” while blaming America for the conflict. He also brought up a longtime suspicion that he shares with Putin — that the U.S., rather than ordinary citizens, fuels what he described as the “color coups” that back democracy. For Khamenei, it is memory of the Green Movement protests that followed Iran's disputed 2009 presidential election that directly challenged the theocracy he leads. Iran's security services used violence and mass arrests to put down the demonstrations. But unrest has re-emerged in recent years over economic issues. For Putin, it is Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution and its later Maidan protest movement that dislodged the Kremlin-leaning politician Viktor Yanukovych. But others from within Iran’s Shiite theocracy have raised concerns about Tehran’s stance on the war. Mohsen Aminzadeh, a former deputy foreign minister under reformist President Mohammad Khatami who was later imprisoned after the disputed 2009 election, went as far as to call Iran’s position “very bad” in a recent interview. “It was possibly the worst, the most passive stance of Iran’s diplomacy since 1979,” Aminzadeh recently told the monthly magazine Ayandeh Negar. On the streets of Tehran recently, 17 people were willing to speak to an Associated Press journalist about the war, with others declining. Of them, 12 supported Ukraine, three reiterated Iran’s official stance and two supported Russia. “I support Ukraine,” said Sajjad, a 26-year-old computer programmer. Like others, he spoke on condition he be identified only by his first name for fear of reprisals. “Russians are killing innocent people for nothing. Why should we remain silent?” A retired Iranian captain, Mehrdad, called Russia’s reasons for the war “ridiculous” and similar to those used by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein to launch a bloody eight-year war on Iran in the 1980s. Saddam at the time pointed to supporting Iran’s Arab minority in its oil-rich southwest as a justification for his invasion. “It is stealing Saddam’s reasons for attacking Iran; possible threats by revolutionary Iran and supporting an ethnic group,” said Mehrdad, 75. “By this excuse, every country can attack others — even Russia.” Ali Nemati, a 64-year-old retired teacher, praised Putin as “very brave” for challenging NATO, also a new preoccupation of Iran’s hard-line government under Raisi. However, Iran has been living quietly next to Turkey, which joined NATO in 1952. “Iran should support Russia since it is alone in its fight against imperialism,” Nemati said. However, in its imperial past, Russia fought multiple wars against Persia, which ceded territory to the czar. Russia invaded Iran alongside Britain in World War II to secure oil and trade routes in their war against Germany. After the war, Russia refused to leave, sparking the first global crisis of the newly formed United Nations. That memory hasn't faded. Russia's brief use of an Iranian air base amid the war in Syria, in which both backed embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad, similarly sparked widespread anger. Now, Iran may be feeling like a poker chip in a wider game rather than a player at the geopolitical table. A sudden demand by Russia for sanctions-relief guarantees threw negotiations in Vienna over Iran's tattered nuclear deal into disarray. Russia's demand seems to have eased, while now it appears American sanctions on the Guard remain the last hurdle. Iranians have noticed Russia's gambit. “The point that Putin made a strategic mistake and sent forces to Ukraine and is now drowning in an Ukrainian quagmire cannot be a (logical) reason for Russia to take the deal as hostage,"" the conservative daily newspaper Jomhouri Eslami said in a March editorial. Taxi driver Abbas Najafi suggested Iran stay out of it all together. “It is not our war. It is not our problem,"" he said. ""We are under the U.S. sanctions now and we should not look for more headaches.” ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.",World/Associated Press,"In Iran, Russia's war on Ukraine is a political flash point",https://news.yahoo.com/iran-russias-war-ukraine-political-060417201.html
