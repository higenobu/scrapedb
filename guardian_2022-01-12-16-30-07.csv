1/12/2022,"State and territory leaders will consider relaxing isolation requirements for the trucking and logistics sector, as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, calls for patience over the country’s disrupted supply chains. With estimates from industry that between 20% and 50% of the transport and logistics workforce is currently out of action as a result of Covid exposure, the government is also pushing for national cabinet to agree to scrap testing requirements for border crossings.  The federal government is also set to allow international students to work more than 40 hours a fortnight in affected sectors, in an attempt to ease workforce pressures in critical industries. After urgent talks with industry groups and unions on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, Morrison convened a meeting of the national coordinating mechanism on Wednesday, which was also attended by senior ministers and the heads of the infrastructure, treasury and health departments. Morrison said that the challenge being posed by escalating case numbers linked to the Omicron outbreak was “keeping things moving”. “That’s what riding this wave of Covid means, and of course … with so many cases appearing every day and that expected to continue until its peak, this will have an obvious impact right across our supply chains,” he said. “It’s important that we continue to problem solve right across all of these areas … in transport, health care, aged care, as we’ve already been doing. “But of course, we require a fair bit of patience through this process as well, because with so many people getting Covid, that is clearly going to take more and more people out of the workforce.” Morrison said the goal was to “get as many people” to work as possible, while continuing to roll out the booster shot program. “Keeping that rolling and keeping the country rolling by ensuring we keep these supply chains intact, is the task,” the prime minister said. Acting small business minister Anne Ruston, who held a roundtable meeting with representatives from the retail, grocery, farming, transport, pharmacy and aviation sectors on Wednesday, said the government was looking at ways to increase the number of people available to work. “[We are] making sure that we look at other innovative ways that we can activate or unshackle potential other employment opportunities,” Ruston told Sky News. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Many older Australians I’m sure would be happy to do a few extra hours work to help out at the moment so we’re looking at how we can help them do that [and] our temporary visa holders in Australia that are all still here. “But also making sure that anybody who is currently on unemployment benefits who are able to work, we’d be really keen for them to undertake some really active investigation about how they can help out with these workforce shortages as well.” Ruston said one of the key demands from industry was for national consistency and clarity around requirements and rules for isolation, testing and workplace activities. National cabinet will consider the changes to isolation requirements on Thursday, and will look to relax isolation rules for other areas deemed essential services, beyond frontline health workers and those in the food manufacturing and distribution sectors. While transport and logistics workers will be the priority, other sectors under consideration for eased isolation requirements also include teachers and childcare workers, mental health and physiotherapy services, veterinarians, and civic services such as rubbish collection and water and energy services. The government is also working on what other requirements should be in place for essential workers who return to work in such circumstances, including booster shots, social distancing measures and hygiene standards. National cabinet will also sign off on new arrangements for pharmacies to distribute rapid antigen tests free for concession card holders, amid concern from the sector that they would be forced to source their own supplies under the scheme. The government is yet to confirm a start date for the scheme. The Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, will give a presentation on economic impacts and the importance of keeping schools open, which will be considered along with health advice that has been finalised by state and commonwealth officials. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said that any changes to isolation requirements needed to be made on the basis of medical advice. “We need to take that advice because where medical advice has been ignored, or short-circuited, the end economic consequences have been more dire than if the medical advice had been followed,” Albanese said. He said workers were already stepping up to help, but were being let down by the federal government. “Working people have made incredible sacrifices and stepped up. They did their part of the bargain, the federal government has not done its part,” he said.",News/Australia news,Isolation rules may be relaxed for transport workers as Scott Morrison asks for patience on shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/isolation-rules-may-be-relaxed-for-transport-workers-as-scott-morrison-asks-for-patience-on-shortages
1/12/2022,"The number of Covid-19 cases reported in New South Wales is set to explode on Thursday after more than 50,000 people registered positive rapid antigen tests on the government’s new app within six hours of it launching. After the state recorded 34,759 new Covid-19 cases via PCR tests on Wednesday, the customer service minister, Victor Dominello, told radio station 2GB that 53,909 positive rapid tests had been registered since it became available on the Service NSW app at 9am.  The government has been preparing for a sharp rise in the number of Covid cases as it prepared for the launch, and it is likely to be days before a picture of the true count becomes clear. This is partly because people have been urged to register positive tests dating back to 1 January. Of the more than 50,000 cases registered on Wednesday, 34,249 had come from the past seven days, with the remaining third dating back to 1 January. “Look it is a big number [but] as you’d expect,” Dominello told 2GB. “Covid is not just here in NSW, it’s in Queensland, it’s in Victoria, it’s in South Australia and all throughout Europe. It’s a pandemic.” The government has placed increasing reliance on the use of rapid tests in a bid to ease the strain on the faltering PCR testing system, despite continuing reports of a shortage of stock. But the premier, Dominic Perrottet, rejected suggestions people would not receive positive Covid results as a result of the shortage, noting that more than 135,000 PCR tests had been conducted on Tuesday and saying rapid tests would become “part of normal life” once supplies increased. “I see the PCR test being complementary and continuing alongside the rapid antigen tests,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The shift to rapid testing has come amid increasing uncertainty around the reliability of Covid case numbers in NSW, after the government removed the requirement for people who tested positive with a rapid test to also receive a PCR test. It has also come as the government urged people not to get PCR tests unless they were symptomatic or a close contact in a bid to ease pressure on the system. On Wednesday the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, conceded the changes had been “confusing”. “I know it’s been really messy, this transition has been quicker than we’ve ever wanted it to be,” she said.

The decision has been criticised as unworkable, and Dominello conceded it was mostly about “messaging”. “We had two options [and] what we are trying to drive which is the lesser of two evils [is] demonstrating that it’s serious,” he said. “If we didn’t have the fine then there’s probably going to be more people taking it less seriously.”",News/Australia news,"NSW Covid numbers set to explode after more than 50,000 positive rapid tests registered",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/12/nsw-covid-numbers-set-to-explode-after-more-than-50000-positive-rapid-tests-registered
1/12/2022,"If you are a man who has failed in an attempt to launch a vodka brand, done the same with a line of steaks, and bankrupted several casinos and hotels, leaning further into the hospitality business might not seem the savviest move.  But that’s exactly what Donald Trump, never one to listen to his haters, or to his advisers, has done, in opening a new bar in his eponymous midtown Manhattan tower. The bar, named 45 Wine and Whiskey, in a nod to Trump having served as the 45th president, promises handcrafted cocktails in “the most exclusive setting”. Opened in late November, it serves a range of president-themed drinks and is, according to the marketing material, a place to “relax and unwind”. That may have been the intention, but a recent visit by the Guardian revealed that 45 Wine and Whiskey mainly serves as an ode to narcissism, or as a world record attempt to cram the most black-and-white photos of one man into quite a small space. Behind the bar alone there are 15 gold-framed photos of Trump, whose penthouse apartment lurks 50 stories above. A giant picture of Trump sitting behind his presidential desk dominates the seating area. In total, there are 39 photos of the former US president in the bar, suggesting this may be a venue for people who are fond of the former Apprentice host. There’s a shot of Trump, the first president to be impeached twice, meeting the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in the Korean demilitarized zone, while another photo shows Trump and Melania flanking an uninterested-looking Queen Elizabeth. One picture, a strange choice, shows Trump holding up a copy of the Washington Post with the headline: “Trump acquitted.” There are other things to look at. From the wooden bar-top a patron can take in the peach marble walls and plentiful golden banisters that mark Trump Tower as one of the leading homages to 1980s opulence. It’s part of a decor theme dubbed “dictator style” by the fashion writer Peter York. Given that 45 Wine and Whiskey replaces the “Trump bar” that previously occupied the same spot, it isn’t exactly a new venture. And much like its predecessor, 45 Wine and Whiskey boasts red velvet seating, marble tables and gold flourishes, in keeping with the rest of the building. The seating area scans out across the lobby, over to the famous gold-effect escalator that spewed Trump on to the political stage in 2015. The drinks follow the grandiose theme – at least in terms of the pricing, which is extortionate. The Forty Five – a whiskey with syrup and bitters, served with two small hamburgers and, bizarrely, a Diet Coke – is $45. The Flotus – a potent white wine and gin ensemble that could hint at Melania’s lack of activity while in the White House – is $29. The Mar-a-Lago spritzer, named after the Florida resort where Trump has been holed up since he left office, is a grift almost on a par with Trump University. The drink consists of white wine, soda water, and grapefruit juice. It is served with an orange wedge, and costs $29. The pricing might explain the fact that during a recent hour-long afternoon visit, the Guardian was the only customer – although it doesn’t explain the laissez-faire opening hours. According to the website, the bar is open from noon to 8pm, but at 1.50pm one day recently there was a red velvet rope guarding the entry, and no signs of life. After leaving Trump Tower and returning at 3pm, the bar was still closed; it was only at 3.45pm, during a third visit, that access was gained. Hopefully for the beleaguered former president, his well-wishers will visit the bar at more suitable hours. But some of his vaccine-skeptical supporters will face a major obstacle, in the form of a big blue sign at the bar’s entrance. “New York City requires you to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to enter this business,” it says. “Those five and older must show proof of Covid-19 vaccination.”",News/US news,Trump’s new Manhattan bar: serving rip-off drinks and a side of narcissism,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/12/trump-bar-manhattan-new-york-45-wine-and-whiskey
1/12/2022,"In a weak moment after the break up of my 30-year marriage, I signed up for a dating site, eHarmony. After paying the subscription for the first month, I realised it wasn’t for me and cancelled that evening. The next morning my bank informed me that eHarmony had attempted to take £65 from my account. I then found lots of angry online reviews claiming that the company charges £65 for the “personality profile” based on a questionnaire that you have to fill out during the registration process. There’s no mention of this charge on the website, or in the terms and conditions. I’ve refused to pay, but have received several emails demanding it.MB, Totnes, Devon  Amid the cyber-jungle of dating agencies, it’s easy to see why eHarmony was appealing. The company, which claims to have created 2 million successful relationships in 20 years, was founded in 2000 when online dating was in its infancy. At its zenith its revenue was reportedly $250m a year and actor Ben Stiller used its services in the 2013 film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Its UK website claims to be the “No 1 trusted dating app” according to an unspecified survey. But something is badly wrong. Online reviews tell the same story of customers drawn in by starry promises, then clobbered by a mysterious £65 when they cancel their membership within the statutory 14-day cooling-off period. To see for myself, I signed up to what is trumpeted as a free service. Integral to the registration process is a lengthy questionnaire about traits and tastes. This instantly generates a personal profile. There is no mention of a £65 fee. The terms and conditions allude to a deduction of “reasonable” costs if a contract is cancelled within the cooling-off period, but a profiling charge is not specified. The “free” service turns out to be almost useless. Photographs of matches are blurred out and customers can only communicate with potential suitors by designated emojis. For fuller interaction, customers are invited to pay a monthly fee with a 50% discount, but these fees are not what they seem. The recommended “premium plus” option promises 12 months of membership “from £9.95”. You have to squint at the small print beneath the payment form on the next page to discover that a £3-a-month instalment fee is added to this, and that the monthly cost nearly doubles to £22.90 three months in. A year’s membership, therefore, costs £244.95. And unless you remember to cancel at the end of the 12 months, it rolls over to the following year. What do you get for this? Not much, apparently. Reviewers complain of unsuitable matches from random parts of the country. I asked eHarmony why customers are not alerted to the £65 fee and it claimed they were required to tick a box accepting the charge during the membership purchase process. When pressed, it clarified that the box appeared after the payment had been completed. It ignored requests for a screenshot. “EHarmony honours all cancellation requests made during the cooling-off period, subject to deductions for services already provided,” it says. “Having purchased a premium membership, customers are presented with a dedicated web page that includes key membership terms and conditions. Here they are asked to tick a box confirming that they would like to access their subscription immediately, and therefore consent to the £65 charge for services received during the first 14 days.” This would appear to be in breach of the Consumer Rights Act, which requires key terms and conditions to be explained and accepted before a contract is agreed. Terms added afterwards are not legally binding. Moreover, if a customer cancels within 14 days, costs can only be deducted for services already rendered and those must be reasonable. I asked eHarmony how £65 was a reasonable sum for a computer-generated profile, but it did not respond. As for the sneaky £3 supplement added to the monthly membership charge, eHarmony explained it was a “small” sum for those who choose to pay in monthly instalments. It did not reply when asked whether the free service allows customers to arrange to meet potential matches and whether those who paid for membership were refunded if they cancelled within 14 days. You did, eventually, receive your subscription payment back and eHarmony agreed to waive the £65 as a “goodwill gesture” when you said you’d contacted the media. At the start of a new year there will be many people looking to start a new relationship. Don’t be beguiled by seductive websites until you’ve checked out the reviews.

1/12/2022,"Acouple of years ago, after a bad academic year, I’d thought things would get better over the summer. They didn’t. I kept walking out of shops without buying what I’d gone in for, because it felt wrong to be taking up space and expecting attention. I couldn’t buy train tickets, even at the machine, because other people deserved to go first and, as soon as there was someone behind me, I gave up mid-transaction. I wasn’t eating much – food was for other people – but at the same time I was travelling and appearing at literary events and festivals, confident on stage as I’d been confident in the classroom all year. It seemed to me that my low estimation of myself off stage was correct and so I didn’t think to seek help any more than I’d seek help for believing that rain is wet. One day in September (kids at school, students still on summer vacation, a time when work can be done from a train or hotel), I was in Paris, changing trains, really, but still with enough sense to know that a person arriving at night and leaving the next day might as well leave late the next day and give herself a day in Paris. I wasn’t sure it would work, knew myself perfectly capable of walking the streets hour after hour telling myself that any competent person would be enjoying museums and shops and cafes and what kind of privileged neurotic steals a day from her work and her family and then doesn’t even have the guts to buy a croissant, days off are wasted on me and I don’t deserve … I knew the city, a bit, from teenaged (mis)adventures, and I set off into the Marais, hungry from missed meals the day before and carrying a backpack too heavy with books. Sunlight through plane trees, the streets still quiet. Old stone, balconies, geraniums, city squares with those perfectly geometric arrangements of trees and municipal planting that we don’t do in England.  I sauntered. I passed a couple of cafes where people sat outside with newspapers, café au lait, tartines. I paused to read menus, though I knew what they’d say and I knew what I wanted, une tasse de chocolat chaud et des tartines au beurre, the breakfast offered by my friend’s mamie every morning in the French Augusts of my teens – in delightful contrast to my sugar-free, wholegrain upbringing in Manchester. There was one cafe in a colonnade, overlooking a garden across which children hurried to school, several people breakfasting alone, and several free tables. I could maybe, I thought, I might not panic if – I did. The ancestral voices were too loud for chocolate and white bread but not so loud I couldn’t order fruit and tea (you do know you could buy that down the road for tuppence ha’penny, you know you’ve just spent all that money on some leaves and hot water). I sat there, in the sun, reading and sipping, almost like a real person who was allowed to be there. I tipped the waiter almost like someone who wasn’t raised by Yorkshire folk. I strolled on. The Picasso museum was closed, but I found it funny rather than another symptom of moral failure that I had, yet again, tried to go to a European art museum on a Monday. Shops began to open. Presents for the children, I thought. A box of patisserie – tissue paper, ribbon, smelling of French butter – that will be a nuisance on the train but a small miracle at home in Coventry after dinner tonight. I backed out of the first place I tried – too grand, not for the likes of me – but managed well enough at the second, and then, wandering into the Pletzl in the Marais, I found a Jewish bakery selling some of the cakes of the other side of my childhood, poppy seed and sour cherry. Another ribboned box. More strolling, and then a public garden glimpsed through the gap in an old wall, which turned out to be the memorial garden to the children of the ghetto. I knew about those children from researching a book I’d written and abandoned, and I sat there with their memories. New small children came to play. I wandered on, passed again the window of a silversmith where I’d admired a bracelet earlier. It was open now and I found I could go in, try on the bracelet. (How much? On yourself, just like that, for no reason? You want your head looking at. Who do you think you are?) I walked some more and sat in another park and watched people and ate a sandwich and a rather lavish piece of cake, and then I went back and bought the bracelet because that afternoon I did briefly know who I am: a woman with a silver dragonfly on her arm, a women who can buy herself a silver dragonfly. I don’t mean to say that shopping cures melancholy. I don’t mean that consumerism isn’t destroying the planet. I don’t mean that being privileged and sad is real suffering. Maybe I shouldn’t have bought my bracelet. Or maybe we’re allowed to find small joys, in proportion to our situations, on a burning planet with the ancestors howling in our ears.",Lifestyle/Life and style,A moment that changed me: I was crippled by negative thoughts – then I bought a silver bracelet,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/12/a-moment-that-changed-me-i-was-crippled-by-negative-thoughts-then-i-bought-a-silver-bracelet
1/12/2022,"As Joe Biden and Kamala Harris readied to speak at the Atlanta University Center Consortium in Georgia on Tuesday, nearly a dozen protesters gathered outside the building, holding up signs that read “end the filibuster” and bore messages of support for federal voting rights protections. Biden and Harris were in Atlanta to bring urgent attention to the party’s efforts to pass new voting rights laws, but some activists who attended the event (and several who opted not to attend) have criticized the president, claiming he was using the moment as a “photo op” instead of putting forth a solid plan of action.  In a video posted to social media during the event, Sandra Williams, the executive director of the ATL North GA Labor Council, emphasized that the group supported the president but wanted strong action to ensure voting rights legislation is passed on the federal level. “It’s time for president Biden to do what he knows to do to pass the voting rights act,” she said. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, two major Democratic bills, have been blocked by Senate Republicans using the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance a bill. The filibuster rule has become a major point of contention. Outside of the event, activist Porsha Miller chanted, “End filibuster, voting rights now” through a bullhorn.Both Biden and Harris pushed for changes to the Senate filibuster rules in order to pass the voting legislation, which is currently stalled in Congress. “I support changing the Senate rules, whichever way they need to be changed, to prevent a minority of senators from blocking actions on voting rights,” Biden said on Tuesday. “Let the majority prevail,” he also said, referring to the 60 votes currently required. “And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.” The move garnered support from the coalition of activists who had previously opted out of attending the event, worrying the president wouldn’t take a strong enough stance or reveal a solid plan of action to ensure the legislation is passed. “We appreciate president Biden and vice-president Harris amplifying the urgency of protecting our freedom to vote, as they demonstrated today in Georgia,” the group of organizers including Fair Fight Action, New Georgia Project Action Fund, Black Voters Matter Fund, GALEO Impact Fund, Inc., Asian American Advocacy Fund, Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, and former Georgia NAACP president Reverand James Woodall said in a statement. Many of the event’s attendees also seemed more supportive of the president, cheering for him when he evoked the two Georgia senate runoffs that helped decide control of the US Senate, and applauding the vice-president when she criticized Georgia’s controversial SB202, an election law passed by the Georgia legislature last year. Specifically, she criticized a portion of the law that makes it illegal to pass out food and water to people who are waiting in line to vote. Cameron Randle, graduate SGA president at Clark Atlanta University, said he wanted the same justice that the activists were demanding, but he was ultimately pleased with Biden and Harris’ speeches. “John Lewis worked so hard for voting rights and (former) President Trump and his supporters, and the Republican senators are really trying to undermine our democracy. That’s why I’m here standing with president Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris to say ‘I stand with y’all.’ In the state of Georgia, democracy is on the line.” In addition to attending the event, he wrote a letter to the president thanking him for Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund, which saw the department of education invest billions of dollars in historically under-resourced colleges and universities, and also asking him to get rid of student loan debt for HBCU graduates. Sawyer Kovacs, a student at Columbus State University, said he traveled from north Georgia to hear Biden and Harris speak. He applauded the administration for hosting the event on a college campus. “College is one of the most important and crucial places to get people educated on things like voting,” he said. The student added that he believes Biden’s speech was a “stride towards progress in ensuring everyone has equal rights and availability to vote and achieve their goals”.",News/US news,‘Democracy on the line’: Biden under pressure to act on voting rights now,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/11/joe-biden-kamala-harris-pressure-act-on-voting-rights-georgia
1/12/2022,"Remember when the media were obsessed with murderous millennials? There was a period, some years back, when every other article was about how millennials were killing everything from the diamond industry to napkins to capitalism. (Alas, we didn’t quite manage to top that last one.) Anyway, we had a good run, but we millennials are old now; we have kids and cricks in our necks. It is gen Z’s turn to pick up the sword. And what do you know? It seems they already have. Their first victim? The word “diet”. According to CNN, diet drinks are disappearing from supermarket shelves and being replaced with identical products labelled as “zero sugar”. “Younger people just don’t like the word ‘diet’,” it reported the chief marketing officer at PepsiCo Beverages North America saying at an industry conference last month. “No gen Z wants to be on a diet these days.”  According to a report by the market research company Mintel last year: “While the diet designation may be associated with strict regimes or deprivation, the ‘zero’ designation has fewer negative connotations, corresponding with simply a cleaner profile.” Credit where it is due: gen Z’s tastes have been shaped by their elders. The word “diet”, along with the strict calorie counting that went along with it, started going out of fashion years ago. “Body positivity” became all the rage and the idea that you might not feel good about your body became slightly embarrassing. Unrealistic beauty ideals were still being shoved down people’s throats, but you couldn’t really admit that they were influencing you. People stopped talking about dieting and starting gushing about woolly concepts such as “wellness” and “clean eating” – which are often just diets in disguise. “Diet” may have become a dirty word, but dieting is by no means dead – it has just gone into stealth mode.

1/12/2022,"Conifer plantations, which are being expanded around the UK to combat the climate crisis and foster biodiversity, are in danger of hurting one of the key species they were thought to protect: red squirrels. The threatened red squirrels, driven to near-extinction over most of the UK by grey squirrel incursion, were thought to thrive in conifer habitats as the food sources in such forests tend to be limited to small seeded cones, which red squirrels are better at exploiting than the more generalist grey squirrels. That should mean conifer plantations prove better for red squirrels than greys.  But new research upends that perception by highlighting the role of pine martens. These native predators were until recently, like the red squirrel, in short supply. Recovery in their numbers has shown that pine martens are generally good for red squirrel populations, at least in native broadleaf woodlands, because they suppress the numbers of grey squirrels. The research, published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found this was not true in conifer plantations, where pine martens lack diverse sources of food and prey on red squirrels instead, turning them from a protector to a threat. To conduct the research, scientists from Queen’s University Belfast and the University of St Andrews, with Ulster Wildlife and the help of citizen scientists, used camera traps to survey more than 700 sites across Northern Ireland over a five-year period, looking for red squirrels, grey squirrels and pine martens. Dr Joshua Twining, lead author of the research, from Queen’s University in Belfast, explained the findings: “In natural woodland, there are diverse amounts of prey, and lots of refuges for squirrels, so red squirrels don’t get predated all that much. But in conifer plantations, where a single species is planted and of uniform age there is very little biodiversity or alternate prey, and an absence of refuges, so pine martens will eat red squirrels to survive here.” He said the research suggested that woodland managers should reconsider whether conifer plantations should be preferred over native broadleaf trees. “We need to adapt our strategy: if we keep planting conifer plantations, as opposed to native woodland, this saviour of the red squirrel may cause its decline in certain locations,” he warned. About three-quarters of the forested area of the UK and Ireland is made up of non-native timber plantations, of species such as the sitka spruce, according to the researchers. Conifer plantations were already a cause of concern to ecologists, as they tend to be monocultures, are often harvested after a few decades, and may provide less diversity than native broadleaf species. But government planting schemes in the UK and Ireland have tended to favour conifers, which are easier to plant and harvest. A spokesperson for the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “We are committed to taking action to recover our threatened native species in England, such as the red squirrel. The planting of coniferous trees in England is at a low level, with our Nature for Climate Fund focusing on the establishment of native broadleaf woodlands at a large scale. Alongside our England Trees Action Plan, this will support the recovery of native red squirrel populations across the country.”",News/Environment,"Conifer plantation push could threaten red squirrel population, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/12/conifer-plantation-push-could-threaten-red-squirrel-population-study-finds
1/12/2022,"Novak Djokovic has released a statement he says will be his last before the Australian government decides whether to re-cancel his visa. In it, the world No 1 male tennis player blamed his agent for an incorrect declaration about his pre-flight travel and acknowledged an “error of judgment” in knowingly attending an event while Covid-positive.  So what did we learn about the timeline of Djokovic’s diagnosis and movements before his travel to Australia – and what are the questions still unanswered in the visa cancellation saga? On 1 January, Djokovic’s agent submitted an Australian travel declaration on his behalf, declaring “no” when asked: “Have you travelled or will you travel in the 14 days prior to your flight to Australia?” Djokovic had obtained an exemption to vaccination requirements from the Tennis Australia chief medical officer, approved by a Victorian government independent review board, stating that he had received a positive PCR test to Covid-19 “recorded on” 16 December. Djokovic’s affidavit to the federal circuit court challenging his visa cancellation set out this timeline: 18 November – the Australian government granted him a visa. 16 December – he “was tested and diagnosed with Sars-CoV-2”. 22 December – his second PCR test returned a negative result. 1 January – he authorised his agent to submit his travel declaration. 2 January – he received a border travel permit from the Victorian government. 4 January – he flew from Spain to Melbourne via Dubai. 5 January 11.30pm – he arrived in Melbourne. 6 January – his visa was cancelled. Guardian Australia and others reported that Djokovic appeared at public events in the days after his 16 December test result despite Serbia’s rules requiring 14 days of self-isolation. These included a ceremony for the unveiling of a stamp in his honour in Belgrade, which he posted about on Twitter, and an event at the Tennis Association of Belgrade for an award ceremony on 17 December. On 18 December, the French newspaper L’Équipe said he took part in an interview and its Champion of Champions awards photoshoot in Belgrade. Djokovic was pictured on the streets of Belgrade in a social media post dated 25 December, in apparent contradiction of his declaration form that stated he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia, which Australian Border Force began to investigate. In Djokovic’s Instagram statement on Wednesday he set out the following timeline: 14 December – he attended a basketball game in Belgrade after which it was reported that a number of people tested positive with Covid. 16 November – he took a rapid antigen test which was negative and a PCR test. 17 December – he attended a tennis event in Belgrade to present awards to children, after testing negative again on a rapid test. “I was asymptomatic and felt good, and I had not received the notification of a positive PCR test result until after that event,” Djokovic wrote. 18 December – despite now knowing he had tested positive, he attended his tennis centre in Belgrade to uphold a “long-standing commitment for a L’Equipe interview” because he “felt obliged” to and “didn’t want to let the journalist down”. “While I went home after the interview to isolate for the required period, on reflection, this was an error of judgment and I accept that I should have rescheduled this commitment,” Djokovic said. Djokovic’s statement on Wednesday that he did not learn of his positive test result until after the event on 17 December follows his own statement to the court that he was “tested and diagnosed” on 16 December and Tennis Australia’s chief medical officer’s letter that his positive result was “recorded on” 16 December. Djokovic’s acknowledgment that his agent made an “administrative mistake” in “ticking the incorrect box” on his Australian travel declaration will arm the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, with another potential ground to cancel his visa. Hawke has the power to cancel the visa if he is satisfied of a ground such as this, or the original ground that an unvaccinated person might pose a risk to public health, and that cancellation is in the public interest. Djokovic’s statement did not address a Der Spiegel report claiming anomalies in the apparently positive PCR test of 16 December. On Monday, Der Spiegel claimed that when it scanned the QR code belonging to Djokovic’s PCR test at 1.19pm German time it said: “Test result Negative.” However an hour later, after another scan, it said: “Positive.” On Tuesday, Der Spiegel said it had found an anomaly in the timestamp for the digital version of Djokovic’s positive test which, it claimed, indicated the result may actually be from 26 December and not 16 December. Spiegel acknowledged the timestamp could also reflect when the result was downloaded. When asked about Djokovic’s PCR test on Monday, his brother Djordje insisted the entire process was public and “all documents are legal”. Wednesday’s social media post also didn’t explain why Djokovic didn’t wear a mask when he visited the children while awaiting his PCR test result. He said he took a rapid antigen test before going to the event “and it was negative” – presumably a false negative. The Instagram statement further didn’t address why he didn’t tell L’Equipe he was positive at the time of the interview and photoshoot.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic timeline: what did he say then and now about his positive Covid result?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/novak-djokovic-timeline-what-did-he-say-then-and-now-about-his-positive-covid-result
1/12/2022,"Hello, I’m Warren Murray and here’s what we have in front of us.  Boris Johnson is facing intense pressure from senior Conservatives to publicly confess he attended a rule-breaking garden party in Downing Street, with the Scottish Tory leader suggesting the prime minister should resign if he broke Covid rules. They are awaiting his explanation at prime minister’s questions today. Senior Conservatives have said MPs are discussing who would replace Johnson. One said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, could be prime minister within months: “It is no longer a question of if the PM will go, it is when.” It has been claimed that Martin Reynolds – Johnson’s aide who threw out the invitation for about 100 Downing Street staff for the “bring your own booze” party on 20 May 2020 – also attended another alcohol-fuelled gathering for No 10 staff on 18 December, the same night as a controversial press office party. A No 10 spokesperson said of the event allegedly attended by Reynolds: “A number of private office staff worked late into the evening on the Covid response.” If police officers saw laws broken while on guard at Downing Street they would be expected to report it, a former Scotland Yard assistant commissioner says this morning. With the Met under pressure to investigate, Robert Quick, who was once in charge of protection operations for Downing Street, said: “The garden at Downing Street would be monitored by police officers. You would have thought the police would be reasonably aware of what was going on there.” Smart motorways brought to halt – The rollout of smart motorways has been suspended by the government until at least 2025. The motorways, which convert the hard shoulder to a live running lane, have been heavily criticised by safety campaigners and relatives of people who have died in crashes after being left unable to find safe refuge when their vehicles broke down. Schemes to convert stretches of the M3, M25, M62 and M40 will be put on ice until five years’ worth of safety data are available, ministers have said. The government has promised £900m for safety measures on existing smart motorways in the meantime, including more emergency refuge areas. Midweek catch-up > Novak Djokovic has blamed his agent for an “administrative mistake” in declaring he had not travelled in the two weeks before his flight to Australia and apologised for an “error of judgment” in attending an event after testing positive to Covid-19. > The UK government is being sued over its net zero climate strategy, which lawyers argue illegally fails to include the policies needed to deliver the promised cuts in emissions. > YouTube is a major conduit of online disinformation and misinformation worldwide and is not doing enough to tackle the spread of falsehoods on its platform, according to a global coalition of factchecking organisations. > In the US, Joe Biden is pushing hard for the Senate to set aside the “filibuster” rule, which Republicans are using to block the protection of citizens’ voting rights. > UK households have suffered the sharpest fall in the amount of cash they have available to spend for almost eight years, amid a worsening cost of living crisis driven by high inflation and rising energy bills. > Waitrose is to start selling “tearless onions” that are the result of decades of selective cross-breeding. Covid latest – One in seven people who have tested positive for Covid could still be infectious if released from isolation upon receiving a negative lateral flow result after five days, new data suggests. The prime minister has indicated he favours reducing the quarantine time from seven to five days. Britain’s parents are being warned to look out for signs of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), which can leave children struggling to breathe. Covid lockdowns last year meant there were fewer RSV infections than normal, so this year there may be less immunity among children. Keep up with Covid developments at our live blog. Tuition scheme branded failure – Labour says the national tutoring programme (NTP) is failing children and taxpayers, with just 10% of this academic year’s target for children receiving one-to-one or small group tutoring from NTP tuition partners reached so far. Official figures show headteachers in England are favouring their own school-led tuition programmes over the national scheme, which was controversially awarded to the Dutch multinational Randstad. The Department for Education has said pupils in England began just over 300,000 tutoring courses last term and insisted the NTP was on track to deliver its target of 2m courses this academic year. DfE figures also revealed that more children stayed off school last week because of Covid than at the end of last term. Demining rat sniffs his last – A rat that won a British heroism award for finding landmines in Cambodia has died peacefully in retirement. Magawa, a giant African pouched rat originally from Tanzania, helped clear mines from about 225,000 square metres of land – the equivalent of 42 football pitches – over the course of his career after being trained to sniff out explosives. He was retired from the field in June of last year. Landmines and unexploded bombs remain a huge danger in Cambodia, with four reported deaths just in the last few days. Hospital trusts across England have declared “critical incidents” in record numbers as the Omicron wave brings rising admissions and staff sickness. But the strains on NHS capacity long predate Covid, says Denis Campbell. With the climate crisis becoming ever more urgent, a growing number of young, childless men are taking the drastic decision of being sterilised for environmental reasons, writes Simon Usborne. Trevor Bayliss, the World Cup-winning former England head coach, has emerged as the in-house favourite to take charge of the Australian men’s team should Justin Langer’s contract not be renewed after the Ashes. Goals from Jan Bednarek, Armando Broja and Che Adams alongside an own goal from Álvaro Fernández gave Southampton a 4-1 win over Brentford in the Premier League. Newcastle are poised to make Chris Wood their second January signing, with the striker scheduled for a medical after the club agreed to meet the release clause of about £20m in his Burnley contract. The Leicester captain, Ellis Genge, has apologised to his teammates for losing his head at Wasps on Sunday and collecting a yellow card which he believes “potentially cost us the game”. The Yorkshire interim coach Ryan Sidebottom has apologised for using “a poor choice of words” when suggesting in a television interview that the county should “forget” the racism scandal that has engulfed the club. Emma Raducanu, the US Open champion, lost her first match of the year in 55 minutes, falling 6-0, 6-1 to Elena Rybakina in Sydney, while Andy Murray defeated Viktor Durasovic in his first-round match. And Kelechi Iheanacho’s excellent first-half goal handed Nigeria a deserved 1-0 victory over a below-par Egypt in their Africa Cup of Nations Group D clash in Garoua. Asian stock markets followed Wall Street higher on Wednesday after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said monetary policy would return to normal and interest rates might be raised earlier than planned. Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Oil prices edged higher. Futures trading suggests the FTSE should be half a per cent higher at the open as well. A pound is worth $1.364 and €1.199 at time of writing. We have a separate round-up of the major front pages today – a summary follows. The Times’ headline says “Say sorry or doom us all, ministers tell Johnson”. The Telegraph says “Johnson losing Tory support” and the junior minister Michael Ellis is shown bearing the brunt of MPs’ anger in the Commons. The Guardian captures the Tory anger too and gives prominence to the suggestion of Douglas Ross, the Tory leader in Scotland, that Johnson should resign if he broke Covid rules. The Daily Mail asks: “Is the party over for PM?”, calling it the “gravest crisis of his premiership”. The Mirror is more emphatic, saying “The party’s over, Boris”. In the Metro, “Contempt for the victims” is the headline, alongside Johnson appearing to “smirk” during an interview about the crisis. The Financial Times says “Johnson faces ‘potentially terminal’ showdown over Downing Street parties” with PMQs taking place today and two polls showing majority support for his resignation. The Sun has the strapline “No 10 garden partygate” and reports Johnson “went into hiding” … “It’s my party and I’ll lie low if I want to” is the headline. The i says “PM’s future in jeopardy as Tories rage at lockdown drinks party”. The Express does its thing and claims support within the party is still strong for Johnson after “delivering Brexit and winning the war against Covid” … “Don’t blow it now, PM!” it urges in the headline.
