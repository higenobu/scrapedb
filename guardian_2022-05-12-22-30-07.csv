5/12/2022,"Deliveroo has been accused of “seeking endorsement for exploitative practices” after signing a deal with the GMB union that does not ensure its couriers will be paid the legal minimum wage throughout their whole working day. The takeaway group has pledged to pay its 90,000 riders at least the minimum wage after costs but only while delivering an order, under the deal which recognises them as “self-employed”. However, they are not paid while checked into the app and waiting for an order, meaning their overall earnings per hour for the time they have set aside for work can fall below the legal minimum level. Alex Marshall, the head of the IWGB union which has been fighting for improved rights for the couriers, said the new deal did not change Deliveroo’s current practices. Classifying riders as self-employed independent contractors means they are not legally entitled to sick pay, holiday pay or the minimum wage. The union, which is seeking to go to the supreme court to challenge a ruling that Deliveroo’s riders are self-employed, described the deal with the GMB as a “hollow and cynical PR move”. Marshall said the timing of the deal, before Deliveroo’s annual shareholder meeting on 20 May, was a “desperate attempt to go to the meeting and say ‘look how great we are doing’ when this company is as rotten as ever”. The GMB union said the deal gave Deliveroo’s couriers the right to collective bargaining on pay and consultation rights on benefits and other issues including health and safety. The union will also be able to represent individual riders who are GMB members in disputes, which it said would give them a “stronger voice”. Mick Rix, national officer at the GMB, said the deal was “a blueprint for those working in the platform self-employed sector”, adding: “Tens of thousands of riders for one of the world’s largest online food delivery services will now be covered by a collective agreement that gives them a voice – including pay talks, guaranteed earnings and representation in times of difficulty.” Will Shu, the founder and chief executive of Deliveroo, said the deal offered couriers “flexibility, guaranteed earnings, representation and benefits”. He added: “Deliveroo has long called for riders to have both flexibility and security and this innovative agreement is exactly the sort of partnership the on-demand economy should be based on.” He said the company was among the first in the gig economy to offer riders free insurance, which covers periods of illness and support for new parents.",News/Business,Deliveroo accused of ‘cynical PR move’ with union deal for couriers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/deliveroo-union-deal-couriers-minimum-wage-gmb-iwgb
5/12/2022,"An image of the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way has been captured, giving the first direct glimpse of the turbulent heart of our galaxy. The black hole itself, known as Sagittarius A*, cannot be seen because no light or matter can escape its gravitational grip. But its shadow is traced out by a glowing, fuzzy ring of light and matter that is swirling on the precipice at close to the speed of light before its eventual plunge into oblivion. The image was captured by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT), a network of eight radio telescopes spanning locations from Antarctica to Spain and Chile, which produced the first image of a black hole, in a galaxy called Messier 87, in 2019. Prof Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam and co-chair of the EHT Science Council, said: “The Milky Way’s black hole was our main target, it’s our closest supermassive black hole and it’s the reason we set out to do this thing in the first place. It’s been an 100-year search for these things and so scientifically it’s a huge deal.” The image provides compelling proof that there is a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, which had been the working assumption of mainstream astronomy. But a minority of scientists had continued to speculate about the possibility of other exotic objects such as boson stars or clumps of dark matter. “I’m personally happy about the fact it really drills home the fact that there is definitely a black hole at the centre of our galaxy,” said Dr Ziri Younsi, a member of the EHT collaboration who is based at University College London. “It’s a turbulent, chaotic and quite violent environment. It made me think, ‘Wow, we’re quite lucky to live at the edge of the galaxy actually.’” To the untrained eye, the latest image might appear similar to that of M87, which is 55m light years from Earth, but the observations are already giving entirely new scientific insights. And, Younsi said, there was an emotional, as well as purely scientific, value in finally seeing the enigmatic object about which our home galaxy revolves. “It’s another doughnut, but it’s our doughnut,” he said. Despite being local in astronomical terms (still 26,000 light years away) observing SgrA* turned out to be more challenging than anticipated and the team has spent five years analysing data acquired during fortuitously clear skies across several continents in April 2017. Sagittarius A* is more than a thousand times smaller and less massive than M87*, meaning a resolution the equivalent of seeing a bagel on the moon was required to bring it into focus. Its size means dust and gas is orbiting it in a matter of minutes, rather than weeks, so the image was constantly changing from one observation to the next. Markoff compared the challenge to trying to capture a puppy chasing its tail using a camera with a slow shutter speed. And the scientists had to peer through the galactic plain, meaning radiation from all the intervening stars had to be filtered out. Some combination of these factors – and possibly some extreme black hole phenomenon – explain the bright blobs in the image. “We didn’t anticipate how evasive and elusive it would be,” said Younsi. “It was really a tough picture to take – it’s hard to overstate that.” The EHT picks up radiation emitted by particles within the accretion disc that are heated to billions of degrees as they orbit the black hole at close to the speed of light, before vanishing into the central vortex. The blotchy halo in the image shows light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole, which is four million times more massive than our Sun. The latest observations are already giving intriguing hints about the nature of our own black hole. Simulations based on the data hint that our black hole’s angle of rotation is not neatly aligned with the galactic plain, but is off-kilter by about 30 degrees. The observations also suggest that SgrA* is in a dormant state, in contrast with some black holes, including M87, which feature vast, powerful jets that blast light and matter from the black hole’s poles into intergalactic space. “If a big star fell in, which would happen every 10,000 years, that would wake it up for a short amount of time and we’d see things brighten up,” said Markoff. Ultimately, scientists hope that observing these competing processes in black holes – gobbling up nearby material versus blasting it outwards into space – could help answer a chicken-and-egg style question about the evolution of galaxies. “It’s an open question in galactic formation and evolution. We don’t know which came first, the galaxy or black hole,” said Prof Carole Mundell, an astrophysicist at the University of Bath who is not part of the EHT collaboration. “From the technology perspective it’s mind-blowing that we can do this,” she said of the latest images. The EHT team’s results are being published on Thursday in a special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

5/12/2022,"In the first Top Gun in 1986 – that anti-Strangelove cold war classic – the US Navy’s fighter pilot Lt Pete “Maverick” Mitchell gets accused of letting his ego write cheques his body can’t cash. But with the sequel, it’s quite clear the body of Maverick, played by Tom Cruise, has been cashing cheques with abandon for decades. His pecs have been setting up standing orders. His biceps have been signing off on direct debits. His abs have been authorising BACS transfers and his rock-hard buttocks each have their own PayPal account. In short, as we return to the extraordinary story of Pete Mitchell, it’s plain that he’s still physically solvent, in the opening scene recklessly test-flying a colossal stealth fighter at Mach 10 against orders from the glowering officer on the ground (played by Ed Harris), who is forced to concede that he’s “got balls”. (They’re both configured for contactless payment.) Almost 40 years on from the first film, which was directed by Tony Scott, Maverick is still speedy, less needy – more centred and calmer, in fact, but still in humungous shape and in love with flying. Directing duties are taken over by Joseph Kosinski, known for his digital effects and sci-fi, and the script is by Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer and longtime Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie. In 2022, Maverick is still only a captain, when he could have been an admiral by now. Despite his badass attitude, he’s respected by the real flyers and loathed by the pointy-headed brass, and is protected by his enduring bromance with former classmate and rival Iceman, who is now an admiral. Val Kilmer gamely contributes a cameo. The inevitable crisis is a double-header. The Navy must get an elite team of pilots to carry out a Dam Busters-style raid on an Iranian nuclear enrichment plant (needless to say, not a single “Iranian” face is clearly glimpsed and the words “Iran” and “Iranian” could be dubbed out for something else for overseas markets). Commanding officer Cyclone (Jon Hamm) has the ticklish diplomatic task of telling Maverick to train this new generation of adorable hotheads without joining them in the skies himself. What’s even trickier is that the new intake includes Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), son of Goose, played by Anthony Edwards in the first movie: Maverick’s wingman and buddy, for whose fate many (including Rooster) still blame Maverick. But you can’t stay mad at Maverick, or keep him on the ground, for long. There’s plenty of rock’n’roll fighter-pilot action in this movie, but weirdly none of the homoerotic tension that back in the day had guys queueing up at the Navy recruitment booths set up in cinema foyers. Weirder still, it is actually less progressive on gender issues than the original film, which did after all put a woman in charge: astrophysicist Charlotte Blackwood, played by Kelly McGillis, was the trainer (inspired by real-life Pentagon official Christine Fox). Now it’s Maverick in charge and there is just the one female pilot under his instruction: Phoenix, a thin role for Monica Barbaro. McGillis has evidently not been invited back and her character is never mentioned. The unmarried Maverick’s love interest this time around is a nice woman who runs the local bar, an entirely thankless part for Jennifer Connelly. But where, oh where, is the towel-round-the-waist, semi-nude locker-room intensity between the guys? The guys who compete with each other but need each other? Well, nowhere. The confrontations happen in more wholesome, open conditions: in Connelly’s bar, mostly, and a healthy good-natured game of beach football for team-building. Teller has to be a tough guy, so his late father Goose is remembered by this film as more of an alpha than he actually was: in fact, Goose was a nerdier and more retiring type, closer to this film’s bespectacled comedy turn Bob (Lewis Pullman). Glen Powell plays an arrogant young pilot, call-sign Hangman, who has the burden of incarnating the big-headedness of both the younger Iceman and the younger Maverick. Cruise’s movie-star chops are still miraculous though, and he has a genuinely touching dialogue scene with Kilmer. Now I want to see him take on a sequel to Risky Business and do the underpants dance again.

5/12/2022,"The Nobel prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa, Latin America’s most eminent living chronicler of power and corruption, has declared a preference for Jair Bolsonaro over Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as Brazil prepares to head to the polls later this year. The 86-year-old Peruvian writer, who also holds Spanish citizenship, revealed his thoughts on October’s election during a talk in Uruguay on Wednesday. “The Bolsonaro case is a very difficult one,” he told an audience in Montevideo. “Bolsonaro’s clowning around is very difficult for a liberal to accept. But now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I of course prefer Bolsonaro. Even with Bolsonaro’s foolishness, he’s not Lula.” The writer, who was beaten to the Peruvian presidency in 1990 by Alberto Fujimori, said Lula was regarded fondly in Europe despite having been convicted “of being a thief”. The controversial corruption charges to which Vargas Llosa referred were annulled last year. His support for Bolsonaro, however, was far from uncritical when it came to the president’s attacks on Covid vaccines. “It’s insane, it’s absurd to oppose [them] in the way he has,” Vargas Llosa said. “It seems absolutely irresponsible to me.” It is not the first time the novelist has thrown his weight behind a rightwing candidate. A few months before the second round of last year’s presidential election in Peru, Vargas Llosa set aside decades of lacerating criticism of the Fujimori political dynasty when he called on voters to support his former foe’s daughter Keiko rather than her far-left opponent, Pedro Castillo, who nonetheless prevailed. “Peruvians should vote for Keiko Fujimori because she represents the lesser of two evils, and if she’s in power there are more possibilities of saving our democracy,” he wrote in his column in Spain’s El País. In 2009 Alberto Fujimori – whose time as president was marked by Shining Path terrorism, economic upheaval and political corruption – was given a 25-year prison sentence for authorising death squads and presiding over rampant graft and vote-rigging. When neighbouring Chile voted in its final-round presidential election last December, Vargas Llosa backed the ultra-conservative José Antonio Kast over the leftwing Gabriel Boric, the eventual winner. The political scientist Daniel V Guisado noted that the novelist had also supported unsuccessful candidates in Spain, Argentina and Bolivia in recent years. “Getting Vargas Llosa’s backing is the biggest political tombstone of the last century,” Guisado tweeted, adding: “Congratulations to Lula.” Progressive Brazilians took the comments as further proof that the legendary Peruvian writer had lost the plot. “What a sad figure,” tweeted the political economist Filipe Campante. “He has lost all political lucidity,” agreed Lucas Paulino, a centrist anti-Bolsonaro campaigner from the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. Vargas Llosa, who has drifted further to the right with age, caused a stir in October last year when he said voting the right way in elections was more important than having free elections. “Latin America will undoubtedly emerge from [a very difficult situation] when Latin Americans discover that they’ve voted badly,” he told the national convention of Spain’s conservative People’s party. “The important thing in elections isn’t that there’s freedom in those elections; it’s voting well – and voting well is something that’s very important because countries that vote badly, as has happened in some Latin American countries, pay dearly for it.”",News/World news,Author Mario Vargas Llosa backs Bolsonaro over Lula in Brazil election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/author-mario-vargas-llosa-backs-bolsonaro-over-lula-in-brazil-election
5/12/2022,"How do you become the richest man in the world? In Elon Musk’s case, part of it involves making workers in China put in hours that would be unacceptable according to labor norms elsewhere. On Tuesday, the Tesla boss praised Chinese factory workers for pulling extreme hours while taking a shot at American workers. “There is just a lot of super talented hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,” the billionaire said. “They won’t just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3am oil, they won’t even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.” Musk’s comment comes as Tesla’s massive Shanghai “Giga-factory” pushes its workers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic lockdown there. In April, Tesla restricted its Shanghai workers from leaving the factory under a so-called “closed-loop” system originally developed by Chinese authorities to contain Beijing Olympics participants. While locked inside, the workers were reportedly made to work 12-hour shifts, six days in a row while sleeping on factory floors. Production at the plant was forced to halt this week due to parts shortages, the company said. Labor rights and safety violations have been reported at Tesla’s Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018, with some workers making as little as $1,500 a month in what an investigation by local journalists dubbed the “Giga-sweatshop.” Even in the United States, Musk is well known for his disregard for labor norms and work-life balance: the tech billionaire infamously declared “nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week”. He has bragged about making Tesla’s US employees work 100-hour weeks, while claiming to have worked 120-hour weeks himself. In March, Musk called an all-hands meeting for his other company, SpaceX at 1am. These practices are on par with China’s extreme work culture, nicknamed “996” in which workers are expected to work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The practice has been the source of protests in recent years and has been characterized as a form of modern slavery. Eli Friedman, a China labor expert and associate professor of international and comparative labor at Cornell University’s ILR School, said Musk’s remark should be understood in the “broader context of American corporations taking advantage not just of the low cost of labor in China, but the flexibility.” For bosses like Musk, “that’s the comparative advantage: the fact that you have hundreds of thousands of workers that you can literally wake up in the middle of the night and put them on the production line,” Friedman said. “It’s kind of tapping into a kind of Orientalist narrative about these kind of robotic Chinese workers who, [Musk] says in a sort of valorized way, that this is a good thing,” the researcher added. Officially, Chinese labor law mandates a 40-hour work week, with employees allowed up to 36 hours of overtime a month – which would come out to just over a 48-hour work week. But that’s not what happens in practice. “There’s no pretence anywhere that that’s enforced,” said Friedman. “Excessive overtime is kind of a built-in feature of the whole model of industrial development in China. Very long hours and compulsory overtime, while not legal, are also completely the norm. And this is done regularly in consultation with local governments who are also tasked with enforcing the labor law.” Employees in China are often asked to sign a “striver’s pledge” which waives their right to overtime pay and paid time off. And while many corporations in China have unions, the unions are funded by the employer, which makes them essentially powerless to negotiate against management, Friedman noted. Tesla did not respond to questions about its factory’s work hours and policies. China’s gruelling culture of extreme hours has been celebrated by tech billionaires in the country, including Alibaba’s Jack Ma, who has called the “996” system a “huge blessing,” and rival company JD.com’s Richard Liu, who has called workers who work fewer hours “slackers”. In recent years, a growing movement of Chinese workers has stood up to oppose overwork, with some activists using tools like GitHub to compile lists of Chinese companies accused of violating labor laws. Anger over the country’s extreme work culture intensified last January after a 22-year-old worker for Shanghai-based e-commerce firm Pinduoduo collapsed and died after leaving work at 1.30am, after a run of brutally long shifts. Incidents like these helped fuel a trend among young Chinese social media users early last year promoting “tang ping”, or “lying flat” on the ground as a passive protest against work, which has since been restricted on the Chinese internet. Later in the year, China’s top court ruled that forced and excessive overtime was illegal, but the ruling has not been well enforced. Work stoppages, often unofficial “wildcat” strikes, continue to occur regularly in China. Chinese and American labor norms have clashed in recent years, as bosses pit teams against each other. The 2019 Netflix documentary “American Factory” described the conflicts that arose after a Chinese billionaire, Cao Dewang, opened a factory in an abandoned General Motors plant in Ohio. “American workers are not efficient, and output is low,” Cao complained at one point in the film. “I can’t manage them.” Last week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that some of the US-based employees at Chinese-owned TikTok were expected to pull back-to-back all-nighters and spend as many as 85 hours a week in meetings to keep up with their Chinese colleagues. In the United States, employees covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act must receive overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. But the law places no cap on the number of hours an employee can work. The grim backdrop to Musk’s comments is that “American workers are in a very subjugated position as well, unfortunately”, said Friedman. “The not-at-all subtle threat is that these Chinese workers are a threat to you white American workers. If you don’t meet that standard, then your jobs are on the line.”",News/Technology,Elon Musk praises Chinese workers for ‘burning the 3am oil’ – here’s what that really looks like,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/12/elon-musk-praises-chinese-workers-for-extreme-work-culture
5/12/2022,"More than a quarter of British households own a cat but, despite being the second most popular pet in the UK, their behaviour still mystifies us. This is because, compared with dogs, cats are asocial creatures programmed to be in constant survival mode, so they rarely show pain or discomfort – making it tricky for owners to spot any health issues. Keeping your kitten fit and well doesn’t just start with what they eat, but how they poo. Yep, gross, we know, but as with all living creatures, you are what you eat – and you are also what comes out of you, to a certain extent. Stool colour, frequency and smell are all factors to consider when looking at your cat’s overall wellbeing, but in particular their digestive health. “The right balance of high-quality nutrients is crucial for the healthy development of your kitten and the ongoing good health of your adult cat,” says Clare Hemmings, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin. The brand offers a wide range of cat food tailored to age, breed, size, in both wet and dry formulations, to help your kitten get exactly what it needs for better digestion and overall health. “Kittens eat little and often and go to the toilet more frequently when young because their digestive tract is immature – they’re not as efficient at digesting their food as a mature cat is,” says Hemmings. Adult cats also prefer the little and often style of eating and thrive on a diet of easily digestible, high-quality meat and vegetable proteins that provide essential amino acids. “It’s much better for their digestive health to graze throughout 24 hours. It also helps them keep to an ideal weight, provided you don’t allow them to exceed their daily ration,” says Hemmings. There is a direct correlation between what you feed your cat and their health – poor nutrition causes digestive issues and can result in health problems, such as pancreatitis and constipation. Changes in bowel movements can be a sign something is wrong. “Faeces should be easy to scoop up, not sloppy or crumbly. It’s just the right size, not too much, not too little. Also watch out if it looks like your cat or kitten is straining to go to the toilet, perhaps sitting but not passing anything, or when they do it is lumpy/crumbly – this may be a sign of constipation,” says Hemmings. Constipation is often triggered by a lack of water and can cause major health issues. “Cats prefer running water, that’s a genetic throwback because sitting water could be tainted, so they won’t drink it,” says Hemmings. “Water bowls should be at least half a metre away from cat food, or better still get a water fountain. Constipation is serious for cats; it can be painful and may need veterinary intervention.” Stress can also trigger changes to a cat’s toilet habits, says animal behaviourist Debbie Connolly. “Any change should be noted. If they start to defecate next to the tray or in another place entirely, consider stress factors: have you moved? Introduced another animal or new human to the household? These small things can be triggers – seek specialist help if you are worried.” Although nobody is expecting you to be a feline faecal expert, there are a few different poo properties that even the untrained eye can look out for. But remember, if any changes concern you, always check with a vet. ColourUsually determined by the food they eat, dark, meat-based food produces darker faeces, whereas food with a high chicken content will be paler. A change to the protein source in their food can result in a change in colour. Warning: Stools that are black or tinged with blood suggest serious digestive health issues, so make sure you consult your vet if you notice this. ConsistencyA healthy bowel movement should be firm, not runny or sticky. Loose stools suggest diarrhoea, which needs veterinary treatment. Kittens are more prone to diarrhoea – their digestive tract is developing, and their immunity is low. They also dehydrate quickly, so always consult your vet if your kitten has diarrhoea. Chalky or lumpy poo suggests a lack of water, so speak with your vet, and change how you provide water for your cat. SmellCat poo should not have an overly strong smell associated with it. If the cat’s diet is too high in protein, or the protein isn’t easily digestible, it can result in heightened aromas. Tip: “Avoid highly scented litter,” says Hemmings. “Cats don’t like it, they also like litter to be deep enough to bury their faeces and soft on their paws.” RegularityYour cat shouldn’t go to the toilet more than a couple of times a day. If you’re guilty of overfeeding your cat, improving the quality of its food to a more scientifically formulated option it can graze on throughout the day will ensure your cat isn’t eating more than it should. Make sure you seek veterinary advice if frequency increases. HairLong-haired breeds such as persians can be at risk of furballs. Passing hair through their digestive system is natural and normal for cats and the best way to eliminate ingested hair. If your cat frequently vomits hairballs, you should consider a specialist hairball diet to help drag hair through the digestive system. WormsRoundworms look like small grains of rice; tapeworms live in the gut, and both are detrimental to your cat’s health. Tip: Cats can get worms from ingesting fleas in their coat when grooming – ask your vet for a dual treatment programme. If you are at all worried about your cat’s health, you should always consult your vet.

5/12/2022,"Deep inside even the fluffiest kitten lies the genetic instructions to build a killing machine; anyone who has received a mutilated “present” on their doorstep can attest to that. Your cat’s distant ancestors first honed their hunting skills by ambushing prey in prehistoric forests millions of years ago, before diversifying into a broad carnivorous suborder of mammals including civets, mongooses, and even hyenas. One branch Feliformia, the felid family, includes cats of all sizes. Felidae can be further separated into two groups – Panthera and Felinae – based on, strangely, the sound they make. Panthera species comprise the “big cats” – lions, tigers, jaguars, and leopards – and roar. Felinae species – including lynxes, Pallas’s cats, cougars and the domestic cat – can only muster a purr, due to bony ligaments in their voice boxes. Interestingly, the cheetah sits within its own genus, called Acinonyx, and is the only living species in this category. Despite their differences, most living cat species share common characteristics that have been shaped by hunting: retractable or partially retractable claws to allow for quieter movement when stalking prey; slender, muscular bodies for an efficient chase; strong forelimbs to hold kills down; and spiny tongues to remove flesh from bone. They are also all obligate carnivores, which means they depend entirely on meat-based diets. In fact, the need for meat has played a significant role in determining their evolution. At home in treetopsProailurus, the “first cat”, is thought to be the first recognisable cat precursor, appearing in the fossil record around 25m years ago. It was a little larger than a house cat but still resembled something like a mongoose, living in Europe and Asia as the prehistoric tropical world we associate with dinosaurs was transitioning into the ecosystem of the modern world. The forests that served as the hunting grounds for many predators began to give way to grasslands, which forced hunters to adapt. Species within the Proailurus genus, with their arboreal nature and partially retractable claws, were excellent at hunting from trees where they could also hide from predators, but their stealthy tactics were just as effective for stalking in the tall grass. Almost all living cat species have retained their distant ancestors’ ability to climb trees. Though adapted for a life in the trees, on the ground Proailurus used the soles of its feet in a similar way to modern primates and many other animals. This would have made the animal slower than its descendants, who eventually evolved the cat-like quality of walking on tiptoes – we call it walking digitigrade – some 5m years later. Enter, Pseudaelurus … A stealthy stalker emergesPseudaelurus, the “false cat”, emerged in Europe, Asia, and North America about 20m years ago. Although they retained the long, flexible spine of Proailurus, they were more recognisably cat-shaped with more speed and increased stealth than their precursors, enabling them to stalk prey in open savanna, rather than forests. They also evolved sharper teeth for tearing meat and began to lose the molars passed down to them for generations. This genus consisted of animals of varying sizes, from specimens closer to our domestic cats, to larger animals the size of modern cougars. It is thought that Pseudaelurus is the ancestor from which all modern cats, both large and small, descended. They were even the common ancestor for the now extinct genus of sabre-toothed cats, the Machairodontinae. Old diets die hardAlthough today’s cats are closely related to other small cats, such as the European wildcat (Felis silvestris), the jungle cat (Felis chaus), the Chinese mountain cat (Felis bieti) and the black-footed cat (Felis nigripes), their specific evolution has largely been shaped by artificial selection. Yet, while human selection has led domestic dogs to stray far from their wolf ancestry, the domestic cat still retains much of its wild heritage. One of the key points here is their diets. Domestic dogs adapted to eat omnivorously while in human captivity around 13,000 years ago, but cats remain dedicated meat eaters. To some extent, according to Clare Hemmings, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin, this is because “cats had no need to adapt to human captivity, because they always had access to meat” in the form of rodents and other small prey. As such, all cats, big and small, lack the enzymatic ability to synthesise important nutrients – such as taurine, arachidonic acid, vitamin A and vitamin B3 – that are mostly found in meat. But while there are great similarities between large cats and domestic ones, there are important distinctions too. “Tigers and other big cats have a massive capacity for gorging and will eat 50kg in one go and then fast for days,” says Hemmings. “But domestic cats like lots of small meals, preferably 14 to 20 a day.” Cats also only have 500 taste buds, compared with a human’s 9,000, so they approach their food through different senses, especially their keen sense of smell. “The best way to show your love for your cat, or any animal, is to respect the species that it is,” says Hemmings, which means we should understand how their food preferences are innately tied to their evolutionary history. For Royal Canin, this means tailoring nutrition to provide vitamins and amino acids that our feline friends have evolved to require, developing specialist kibble shapes for jaws influenced by natural and artificial selection, and ensuring the taste, aromatic and textural experience packs enough punch to make up for a cat’s relatively unrefined sense of taste. They don’t only provide your cat with the food it deserves; they honour millions of years of survival and adaptation, too. This will ensure your fluffy hunters continue to be the king of your house, even if they’re no longer kings of the jungle.

The Test side have won one of their past 17 games and are being overhauled after the dismissal of the previous coach, Chris Silverwood, in January after the team’s abject performances in the Ashes, and the resignation of their captain, Joe Root, after their series defeat in the West Indies in March. Ben Stokes was named as the side’s new captain last month. McCullum has agreed a four-year contract, and will arrive in the UK later in May after the completion of Kolkata Knight Riders’ Indian Premier League campaign. The New Zealander’s first series in charge will be against the Black Caps in June. “I’d like to say how pleased I am to be given this opportunity to positively contribute to England’s Test cricket setup and move the team forward into a more successful era,” the 40-year-old said. “In taking this role on, I am acutely aware of the significant challenges the team faces at present, and I strongly believe in my ability to help the team emerge as a stronger force once we’ve confronted them head-on. I’ve enjoyed several robust conversations with Rob Key about the direction of travel for the team and have found his enthusiasm contagious. I’m no stranger to bringing about change within a team environment, and I can’t wait to get started. Ben Stokes is the perfect character to inspire change around him, and I look forward to working closely with him to build a successful unit around us.” McCullum, who will give up his role with KKR at the end of this year’s IPL after three years as head coach, previously coached Trinbago Knight Riders to the 2020 Caribbean Premier League title. Although he has no experience as a coach in the first-class game he captained New Zealand in 31 of his 101 Test matches, starting a process of improvement that culminated, five years after his retirement, in them winning the inaugural World Test Championship last summer. He will certainly be able to identify with England’s current predicament: when he took over New Zealand’s Test captaincy they were ranked eighth, and in his first innings as captain in 2013 they were bowled out for 45 by South Africa. McCullum is a close friend of Eoin Morgan, England’s white-ball captain, having acted as master of ceremonies at his wedding, and his New Zealand side were seen as the template for the successful reconstruction of England’s limited-overs fortunes following their humiliation at the 2015 50-over World Cup. “I like to pick his brain,” Morgan said in 2019. “As a pure leader, he’s exceptional. New Zealand cricket had embodied playing fun cricket under him. Playing against them, we were a little bit jealous.” Rob Key, England’s newly appointed managing director of men’s cricket, said he hoped McCullum and Stokes would make “a formidable partnership”. “It has been a real privilege to get to know him and understand his views and vision for the game,” said Key, who sat on the recruitment panel alongside the ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, the strategic adviser, Andrew Strauss, and the performance director, Mo Bobat. “He has a recent history of changing cricket culture and environments for the better, and I believe he is the person to do that for England’s red-ball cricket. We were incredibly fortunate to have a seriously strong list of quality candidates for the post, with Brendon demonstrating he was our No 1 choice. Time for us all to buckle up and get ready for the ride.”",Sport/Sport,Brendon McCullum named England men’s Test coach on four-year deal,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/brendon-mccullum-named-england-men-test-coach-cricket
5/12/2022,"Colm Bairéad resigned himself to walking away empty-handed from the Irish Film and TV awards in March. His tiny-budget Irish language drama The Quiet Girl was up against Kenneth Branagh’s multi-Oscar-nominated juggernaut, Belfast. “We were like: ‘OK, well, that was lovely.’ We’d got 10 nominations. We’re just happy with that, you know?’” But, on the night, The Quiet Girl swept the board, with eight wins, including best film. “Winning all those awards was, er, extraordinary.” Bairéad, 41, looks mildly embarrassed. He is modest and thoughtful, not fully relaxed at being the centre of attention. I suspect that the hour we spend chatting at the Soho offices of the film company distributing his film is about 59 minutes too long for him. The Quiet Girl (An Cailín Ciúin in Irish) is his first film. It is the beautiful and extremely moving story of a nine-year-old girl from a poor family who is farmed out to relatives while her mother gives birth to yet another baby. It is based on Claire Keegan’s acclaimed 2010 novella, Foster, which Bairéad read after spotting it on a Top 10 list of books by Irish female writers. It left him floored, in floods of tears: “I fell in love with the story in such a profound way.” Then panic set in: “I was sure someone had snapped up the rights. But, miraculously, they were available.” It is set in early 1980s rural Ireland, where withdrawn little Cáit (Catherine Clinch, already being talked up as the next Saoirse Ronan) is unloved and ignored by her family. Her father is a drinker and gambler; her exhausted mother struggles to meet the basic needs of her children. At the beginning of summer, Cáit’s dad packs her into his battered Ford Cortina and drives three hours to Waterford, to drop her with relatives she hasn’t seen since she was a baby: her mum’s cousin Eibhlín Cinnsealach (Carrie Crowley) and her gruff farmer husband, Seán (Andrew Bennett). But in the care and kindness of these strangers – with hot baths, hair-brushing, a pound slipped into her hand for a choc ice – Cáit comes to life. It is as if she is being seen for the first time. This is a film of gorgeous simplicity and heartbreaking humanity – full of details that gave me great rushes of overwhelming emotion. When Cáit’s dad drops her off at the Cinnsealachs’, he drives off with her suitcase in the boot, leaving her only with the clothes in which she is standing. It tells us everything about his indifference. (The mystery for Cáit to discover is why there is a wardrobe of boys’ clothes at the couple’s house, when they do not have children.) My favourite moment comes when grumpy-seeming Seán silently leaves a chocolate biscuit on the kitchen counter for Cáit – a tiny gesture of love that speaks volumes. Speaking to the Observer when Foster was published in 2010, Keegan described her story as “an examination of home and an examination of neglect”. For Bairéad, it has something to say, too, about the shame in Ireland’s past of children being mistreated. Nothing terrible happens to Cáit; this is not a story about abuse in orphanages or the Magdalene laundries. “But it’s a film that’s still quite aware of that backdrop,” Bairéad says. He quotes a line from the Irish proclamation of independence. “It promises to cherish all of the children of the nation equally. That’s certainly something that we as a society haven’t always managed to do.” In the film, a neighbour of the Cinnsealachs gives Cáit the once over and asks: “Can she be put to work?” – as if this small child is a farm dog or a horse. Bairéad became a father two years before he read Foster. One of the things that interested him was how parenting has changed in Ireland. “In 1981, we were on the threshold of a modern Ireland, but still very Catholic and socially conservative. Children were seen and not heard. That was very much a staple of Irish life in the past.” Was that his experience growing up? Bairéad shakes his head. “My parents would’ve been more liberal. But then there were still vestiges. We were hit; the wooden spoon and all that.” He was raised in Dublin in a bilingual home – his dad was a teacher of German and only ever spoke to him in Irish. When I mention my Irish heritage, Bairéad asks my surname and translates it into Irish. “Clarke. That’s Ó Cléirigh.” He and his wife, Cleona Ní Chrualaoi – she is also his producer – are raising their two sons in Irish. “I’m turning into my dad now,” he says. “I don’t speak English to my boys.” Irish is on the decline as a language and audiences at home will mostly be watching A Quiet Girl with subtitles. “Irish people have this sort of strange relationship with the language,” says Bairéad. “Everyone’s forced to do it in school, but most leave with very little. They can ask: ‘Can I go to the toilet?’ in Irish or whatever.” Yet he has noticed a shift in the perception of the language, particularly in younger people. “I don’t know whether that’s because they’re more culturally sensitive. I think, after going through a recession and a pandemic, that society started to look inward a little and reappraise identity a little, you know?” Besides, there is a connection to the language: ‘It’s wrapped up in all of these things to do with national pride. And there is a recognition factor as well. People understand the texture of the language, because even the way we speak English as Irish people has all these inflections that are hangovers from the Irish language.” A renaissance in Irish-language cinema, which began with the potato-famine drama Arracht, has been credited to a funding initiative led by the Irish-language broadcaster, TG4, which financed The Quiet Girl. Bairéad thinks the scheme is a product of a growing confidence in Irish-language culture. In the past six months alone in Ireland, there have been four Irish-language films. So why has The Quiet Girl captured so many hearts? Bairéad answer is characteristically modest. “Um, I’m not sure what the reason is. I just think it sort of says something, maybe, about our country, our past and our character.” After screenings, people have been coming up to him in tears. “There was a woman in her early 80s. She’d been fostered as a child and she said that the film had captured completely how she felt walking into these new homes. It brought back all of that to her. As she was telling me, I could see the pain there, you know?” The Quiet Girl is in UK cinemas from 13 May",Arts/Film,‘I fell in love with it in a profound way’: how The Quiet Girl’s fostering story captured its director’s heart,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/12/quiet-girl-irish-language-film-colm-bairead-foster-claire-keegan
5/12/2022,"Hannah Walker first noticed her partner liked to gamble when they would go to the pub together: he would make a beeline for the fruit machine, while she’d play quizzes and card games on itbox machines. “But he’d stay on the fruit machine a lot longer, and I’d leave the itbox to continue my glass of wine,” she recalls. She thought nothing of it at the time. Just like her enthusiasm for a few glasses of wine, she saw casual gambling as a vice, but one that was fun and easily managed. Over the next few years, though, unexplained money troubles became an increasing feature of the couple’s life together. Walker’s partner was constantly glued to his phone, until one day in 2019 he left it at home by accident. “I knew something wasn’t right, so I logged in, and discovered that so much money had been going into online gambling.” Her initial reaction was shock, but also shame. “I didn’t want to tell family and friends about it because my partner is the most wonderful man in the world ever, but I knew they would judge him for it.” Like many partners of gambling addicts, Walker was perplexed by the gulf between how she perceived her partner – kind, caring, responsible – and how addicts are typically portrayed: as people who are out of control, and who don’t follow the advice of one discontinued industry-funded slogan, “When the fun stops, stop”.As a performance artist, Walker’s remedy was to turn her experience into a piece of multimedia theatre, drawing on hours of interviews with addicts, their partners and clinical experts to help her understand how someone she so admired could be drawn into an expensive compulsion. What she took away from those conversations is the central message underpinning her new show, Gamble: “I’ve learned that gambling addiction has nothing to do with someone’s character.” Opening at the Northern Stage theatre in Walker’s home town of Newcastle upon Tyne on 19 May, Gamble focuses on how websites use manipulative techniques to lure people in. Using video, lights and music, Walker creates a sinister, DayGlo dreamscape evoking the flashy colours of sites that promise punters harmless fun. Walker, dressed in a suit covered in dollar bills, casts herself as an industry gatekeeper. “We love looking after our new customers,” she purrs while offering “free bet” promotions, which is where many addictions start. For much of the show, Walker’s co-creator, Rosa Postlethwaite, sits silently on a sofa turned away from the audience. A projection shows her compulsively gambling on her phone, reflecting how online platforms have made addiction a solitary, 24/7 experience. Gamble’s main plot line is autobiographical, charting Walker’s experience with her partner, from the moment of discovery – “I want my £100,000 back!” she shouts – to the process of coming to terms with her partner’s condition. She describes how although he leaves Gamblers Anonymous meetings feeling proud of his progress, she feels awful, anxious about the money that’s been spent and uncertain how to deal with her own feelings. She and her character are not alone in that regard. Walker learned that many addicts and the people close to them are crying out for a space to share experiences. Unlike alcohol and drug addiction, which are better understood, there are far fewer support groups available. “There is such a stigma around addiction, and I don’t know why that is, but all I know is that the more I talk about the fact my partner has gambled, the more people talk to me about their experience, and share that a family member or someone they know has gambled,” she says.Every performance of Gamble will be followed by a Q&A with Matthew Gaskell, a psychologist, gambling expert and clinical lead on addiction for the NHS Northern Gambling Service. Walker is also organising coffee and cake mornings for people to exchange stories. She and Gaskell believe that the shame associated with addiction is a deliberate strategy employed by gambling firms to distance themselves from its harms, and shift the burden of responsibility on to individual players so as not to jeopardise the industry’s £5.9bn annual profits. “They’re conveying the message that addiction ‘has nothing to do with us: you’re the one with the problem, you need to take responsibility and control yourself’. It’s no accident that they employ those tactics,” Gaskell says. “What’s been handed down to us through the years is the idea that addiction is a moral failing, a weakness of will. Even though this is undermined by science, it pervades the public discourse. This is compounded for gambling because less is known about it; it’s portrayed as everyday, harm-free, fun entertainment.” According to Gaskell, just 2 to 3% of people with a gambling addiction come forward for support. His patients say this is because they have no idea it is a health problem akin to drug or alcohol addiction. This is partly due to the increased societal acceptability of gambling, so it’s not seen as a problem, but also a lack of public health messaging showing people how to get help.Gaskell thinks this is because the government is in thrall to the gambling industry, labelling it a leisure pursuit and placing it under the control of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport rather than the Department for Health and Social Care, which would shift the emphasis towards harm reduction. Public health messaging is typically funded by the gambling industry, leaving the public “ignorant to its dangers and harms”, he says. This, says Gaskell, is in keeping with a culture shift that has taken place in recent years, and which he attributes to how online platforms have reinvented gambling’s image. “When I was growing up, gambling was seedy, behind frosted glass, something middle-aged men did with the Racing Post under their arm. It certainly wasn’t something young football supporters did; it’s changed – they’ve hijacked youth culture and made it a cool thing.”He sees irony in the resistance to supercasinos in the 2000s, which were halted following a public outcry. “Fast forward a few years and everyone’s got a supercasino in their pocket … Rapid, continuous forms of gambling are where the harm is,” he explains. This is because slow-moving events – buying a national lottery ticket, for example – are less likely to push people into a “hot state” in which they lose control and continue to bet, even though they’re losing money. Walker’s play coincides with a pivotal moment for the industry. This month, the government is expected to publish a long-awaited white paper on gambling, which addiction experts hope will introduce stronger regulation of the online market, including curbs on advertising and affordability checks, as well as preventing the industry from funding research and public health messaging, as big tobacco did in the past. “The whole thing almost needs to be ripped up and started again,” says Gaskell. “The harm is so severe and pervasive, the previous laws just aren’t fit for purpose.” The power of Walker’s show lies in her own emotional journey. “When I first found out [my partner was gambling], I was shocked, and in my head I was like: ‘If this ever happens again, I’m gone, I’ve got a baby.’ But when my partner relapsed it was so different, my emotional state in that moment. I felt: ‘OK, that’s happened, but the way you feel now must be so shit and so low that I completely empathise with you, and we will get through this.’ “I think if I hadn’t began making the show, or doing any of the research, we potentially wouldn’t be together.” Gamble is at Northern Stage, Newcastle upon Tyne, 19 to 21 May.

5/12/2022,"The 20-year manhunt for one of the world’s most brutal killers has come to a decisive end in an overgrown cemetery outside Harare. The body of Protais Mpiranya, the former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard indicted for genocide, lay buried under a stone slab bearing a false name, which UN investigators tracked down and identified with the help of a critical lead found on a confiscated computer: the hand-drawn design for Mpiranya’s tombstone. His body was exhumed last month at the request of UN investigators, and Mpiranya’s identity was confirmed by DNA analysis on Tuesday. The man charged with overseeing the slaughter of thousands of Rwandans, and abetting the murder of many more, died in Harare in October 2006 of a heart attack brought on by tuberculosis, at the age of 50. But his death, like much of his life, had been swathed in secrecy by his family and supporters. Mpiranya had been living in Zimbabwe under an assumed identity for four years, despite its government’s insistence that he was not in the country. The investigation that followed his trail all the way to the grave in Granville cemetery on the southern edge of Harare found he had arrived on a Zimbabwean military plane and had been in frequent contact during his stay with Zimbabwean officials in the then president Robert Mugabe’s regime who were well aware of his identity as a valued ally in the second Congo war of 1998-2003. “That the Zimbabweans, at least elements of the authorities, knew he was in Harare is obvious,” said a senior official involved in the investigation. “He was even seen meeting with Zimbabwean officials. Of course he was trying to hide his identity from the public, but the entire reason he went to Zimbabwe is because of his relationships there.” The Guardian has asked the Zimbabwean government for comment. As a fugitive, Mpiranya had outlasted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994 to bring the genocidaires to justice after the genocide that killed up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. It had indicted him on eight counts, including genocide and crimes against humanity, but was unable to find him to make him stand trial. After the tribunal closed in 2015, a “residual mechanism” was set up to wrap up old cases, and part of that mechanism was a small tracking team under the command of the chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz. At 7am on 7 February, members of the team arrived at the cemetery, where the graves were invisible beneath head-high grass. It took two and a half hours to find what they were looking for: a black headstone in memory of a Sambao Ndume whose date of birth matched Mpiranya’s, 30 May 1956. A team member recalled the discovery of the grave: “There was that moment when my colleague called out: ‘Found it!’ And we all just stood there looking at it. It was exactly as we thought it would be,” he said. “All that hard work, the ups and the downs, it had led to this moment.” The French inscription on the tombstone read: “Here rests forever one who loved his fatherland, his people and his family, more than his own life.” Below that, a crude depiction of a warrior with bow and arrow was carved with the message: “Dad RIP”. The path that had led the trackers to the grave was long, convoluted and dotted with dead ends. There were supposedly eyewitness reports from across Africa from people claiming to have seen him, and until late last year the investigators believed he was probably still alive, hiding out in Zimbabwe with his fellow combatants from the Congo war. By May 2020, Mpiranya was the last major fugitive among the 93 accused indicted by the ICTR, and the most wanted war crimes suspect in the world. As head of the Rwandan presidential guard in 1994, according to his indictment, he had given his men a kill list of prominent Tutsis and orders to kill their families too. He armed and trained the notorious Interahamwe Hutu militia, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. And with the signal for the bloodletting to begin, the shooting down of the plane carrying the country’s president, Juvénal Habyarimana, on 5 April 1994, he sent his men to set up roadblocks at which Tutsis were massacred. Soldiers from the presidential guard murdered the prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, and mutilated her body. The 10 lightly armed Belgian soldiers who had been sent to protect her were shot and hacked to death with machetes. After the fall of the Hutu regime in July 1994, Mpiranya fled across Africa, spending four years in Cameroon until it became inhospitable for genocidaire fugitives. He moved on to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), fighting with Hutu forces and Zimbabwean troops on behalf of the country’s president Laurent Kabila, against the Rwandan army, in what became known as the second Congo war. Zimbabwean officers saw the former commander as a cut above most of the Congolese troops they were fighting alongside . “He developed a lot of relationships with these guys during the war,” a senior official in the prosecutor’s office said. “They respected him. He was a good commander, a professional, someone who listened, asked questions and took decisions. He was very security conscious. So he impressed the Zimbabweans when others they were working with did not.” So when Mpiranya was first indicted in September 2002, his friends and admirers in Zimbabwe helped spirit him across borders. According to witnesses, he flew from Mbuji-Mayi in central DRC to Harare on a Zimbabwean military plane. Mpiranya brought a small entourage of Hutu commanders with him and, using a fake identity, set up a small transport business with two large vans, bought most likely with proceeds from Congolese diamonds. He was better at giving orders than doing business. The venture floundered, and over the four years in Zimbabwe, Mpiranya’s standard of living crumbled. Starting off in a substantial villa in the first year, the family had to downgrade to an apartment in the same area and then another in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood. They stopped hiring conductors for the buses and a family member had to do the work themselves. Then both buses were in accidents and there was no money to repair them. Much of the rest of his assets were wiped out by Zimbabwean high inflation in those years. When Mpiranya fell sick with tuberculosis, he had no money left to pay for his medical care and his wife in the UK had to take on more work to send funds. Filling in the forms for hospital admission, he used a new identity, Sambao Ndume, the name he would be buried under. The UN investigators believe his family and friends covered up the death so as not to dent morale among the Hutu forces in DRC – and so as not to expose themselves to scrutiny. The tracking team found several had secured safe haven in the UK and EU with bogus asylum claims. The tribunal tracking team spent the time chasing wispy leads around Africa, provided by informants either seeking to cover up Mpiranya’s death, or looking to make money, or both.“The family and his associates deliberately concealed for the last two decades his presence in Harare and his death,” Brammertz said. “The investigative file was filled with information that he was quite active, with businesses and associates in several countries. My predecessors, and perhaps even myself at the beginning, focused more on those leads.” Over the past few years, the tracking team went back over the entire investigation, reviewing the databases, interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses, stripping out tips and speculation, and the investigators’ own possible bias, back to the last fact in Mpiranya’s life they knew for sure: he was in the DRC in 2002. They reconstructed every known detail of his life, his mindset and connections. The breakthrough came last September with the seizure of a computer and other material in a raid in a European country (which the Guardian is not allowed to identify). Combing through a mass of data, they came across emails with veiled references to “the one who has a passed” and the “old man”. Then they cross-checked with the travel of some of Mpiranya’s relatives, from visa stamps sent by partner governments, and found them converging on Zimbabwe in October 2006. Sifting through hundreds of digital pictures, they found photos of a funeral including those of the body laid out for the mourners. It looked like Mpiranya and was dressed in a suit that the investigators later found in the grave. Finally, they found the photo of a hand-drawn picture of a gravestone, sent by a close relative, and realised it was a commission for the stone carvers of Harare. If they could find a stone like that, they could find the body. After years of stalling the search, the Zimbabwean authorities agreed to allow the body of the man calling himself Sambao Ndume to be dug up. On 27 April, the trackers, a UN pathologist, and three Zimbabwean detectives gathered at the grave as the sun rose. About 20 riot police had been sent along as well, torpedoing any hopes that it could be done quietly. The conspicuous police presence drew a small crowd of curious local residents. The gravediggers worked their way down to the coffin with spades, and then the pathologist took over, climbing down into the grave to take a careful sample, without disturbing the rest of the body, with a deference Mpiranya had not accorded to his multitude of victims. Prosecutors are still looking for five more indictees, and Brammertz believes the discovery of Mpiranya’s body will increase the pressure on the governments of other countries, where the last ageing fugitives are thought to be hiding. But Mpiranya was the last of the main figures of the Rwandan genocide to be accounted for, although he had succeeded in avoiding a trial. “Of course the goal is to arrest fugitives,” Brammertz said. “But we need to account for them, one way or the other. First, because as they say themselves, survivors and victims want a final answer. “And second, to say this person is dead means they can’t cause further harm, and they aren’t living this nice life as a fugitive somewhere while the victims try to rebuild their lives. “And, of course, for the UN and our mandate,” he added, “we have to demonstrate our determination and that we go all the way.”",News/World news,Twenty-year search for Rwanda genocide suspect ends in Zimbabwe grave ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/twenty-year-search-for-rwanda-genocide-suspect-ends-in-zimbabwe-grave
5/12/2022,"When Laurie Bertram Roberts was 17, she was sent home from hospital and almost bled to death. Pregnant and experiencing bleeding, she had gone to the emergency department of her nearest hospital in Indiana twice, and was told she was miscarrying, but, because a scan showed the foetus still had a heartbeat, she was also told there was nothing they could do. What she needed, in order to end a pregnancy that was ending anyway, was an abortion – but she says the Catholic hospital would not provide one. “They had the power to end my pregnancy right there, when I was already bleeding fairly heavily, in a tremendous amount of pain. Instead, they sent my scared 17-year-old self, a mother of two already, home.” There Bertram Roberts collapsed. She closes her eyes, visualising the scene. “I remember what it feels like to think you’re dying. Laying on the floor, in my mom’s kitchen, I passed out.” She was taken to hospital to have the emergency procedure that she could have had earlier. She had twins already, having got pregnant and married at 16 (though the marriage didn’t last). By the time she was 25, Bertram Roberts, now 44, had seven children. She had wanted to terminate one of these pregnancies – her health was suffering so soon after her previous birth, and she was a single parent living in poverty. It seemed impossible to have another baby, but when she arrived at the clinic, she found she couldn’t afford the abortion. “I got turned away, and then I ended up being too far along. The trauma of that, even though I love my child … I came to terms with having to stay pregnant, but not everybody does. I was fortunate – I had my mom and my grandmother to help me. That’s the only reason I made it through. I can’t imagine what it would have been like if I didn’t have that.” Both these events – needing or wanting an abortion, but not being able to have one – crystallised Bertram Roberts’s belief in reproductive rights, and set her on a course as an activist. Bertram Roberts, who identifies as a non-binary femme, is executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, an organisation based in Alabama that provides abortion care and campaigns for reproductive justice. When we speak over Zoom, Bertram Roberts – warm, funny, just the person you’d want to get you out of a difficult situation – is at home in Tuscaloosa, with a Wonder Woman poster just behind her. The previous organisation she founded and is still involved with, the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund (MRFF), is now run by two of her daughters. Since the draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade, which had established a legal right to abortion, was leaked, Bertram Roberts says: “I haven’t been able to sleep, but before this, I was having trouble sleeping.” In the states she has lived and worked in, abortion access has always been fragile, and increasingly limited. Mississippi has a “trigger law”, which means that abortion will be banned if, as looks likely, Roe v Wade is overturned. It will almost certainly become illegal in Alabama, too, as well as neighbouring states, meaning options for women – even if they could afford to travel – will become extremely limited. It will disproportionately affect women of colour, who accounted for nearly 67% of abortions in Alabama in 2019, and those living below the poverty level, who will be more likely to self-manage abortion with pills at the risk of being caught, “and criminalisation is going to disproportionately fall on black and brown bodies, because it always does.” Forced birth, says Bertram Roberts, “is going to kill people. You can’t force people to stay pregnant and then not expect that people are going to die, when it’s more risky to give birth than to have an abortion. And that’s just in general, that’s not even specific to black women.” Yellowhammer and MRFF have provided women with money to pay for not only the abortion itself (since 2020, Yellowhammer has had its own clinic, but both funds enable women to access clinics across state lines), but transport, childcare costs, and food. Bertram Roberts sees reproductive justice as all-encompassing – not just providing access to abortion and contraception, but supporting families to look after the children they already have. “We’re also doing work around self-managed abortion, making sure people know how to safely use pills.” Bertram Roberts was raised a fundamentalist Christian and grew up believing abortion was evil. As a child, she would go on “plenty of anti-choice events. I got told that I was a survivor of the ‘post-Roe holocaust’.” A grim smile. “And they would specifically say to me I should be very grateful that my white mother decided to have me because she was pregnant with a black man’s baby.” Then, she says, “life happened, and I became a teenage mom and wife. I got pregnant again and again and again, and you just learned that no issue is as black and white as anti-abortion activists try to make it seem.” She has always been an activist – when she was about 11, she started a petition at school to get a janitor, who had been bullying children, fired. In her 20s, she went to a community college, and excelled, despite having her last two children during her time there. At 27, she got a scholarship to Jackson State University in Mississippi, leaving her children with her mother while she studied for a political science degree. She would call them every evening, and spend every night marking their homework. In her third year, they were allowed to come and live with her on campus. University – where she embraced racial justice and feminist campaigning – politicised her. As an older student, and mother of seven, young students sought her out if they were pregnant and wanted an abortion. “When folks needed to figure out how to get to a clinic or how to get the money, I was kind of that person.” She was also part of a group fighting to get the university to take the domestic violence she had witnessed on campus seriously (before university, she had survived domestic abuse). During this time, a fellow student, Latasha Norman, was killed by her boyfriend. “We could have been doing actual preventative work,” says Bertram Roberts. “One of the lessons that I learned from that is that we help us. It’s good to work on policy and within the system, but at the same time, we got us. That really influenced the work I do now.” She became more involved in abortion rights around the time Mississippi was considering the “personhood amendment”, which, had it passed, would have defined life as the moment of conception, but was rejected by voters. Involved with the local branch of the National Organization for Women (NOW), she was the only person who would go on television to talk about the incendiary issue of abortion. “A lot of people had jobs to lose,” she says. Bertram Roberts was unable to work because of chronic health problems. “You can’t fire me from being disabled,” she says with a laugh. “What are you going to do? Fire me from being a caretaker to my kids?” Funny and forceful, she is a natural communicator, and didn’t go in for euphemisms such as “reproductive health”. “Abortion! Say the word, otherwise a lot of times people don’t even know what you’re talking about. So that became my job. I became the abortion lady of Mississippi.” By 2013, she was escorting women to clinics. What was that like? She pauses. “I won’t say I wasn’t ready, because I knew what they [the anti-abortion protesters outside clinics] were going to be like, but I don’t think I expected them to be so personal. It was like they did research on me – they knew how many kids I had, they knew when I had them.” Her teenage daughters would go with her and Bertram Roberts remembers protesters calling them “jezebels”. “Like, who does that?” she says. “They would come up to [my daughter] and be like, ‘how many abortions have you had to be so eager to kill black children?’” Bertram Roberts wasn’t, she says with a wry smile, “ready for them to lecture me about black history. The audacity of these white people!” They would tell her that one day she would be on trial “just like Nazis. ‘OK, thank you, people who think The Handmaid’s Tale is a fanfic. Please get the fuck out of my way.’” She gets abusive emails now, including one this week that ended by saying her mother should have aborted her. She laughs and says, “there’s nothing like being so anti-abortion that you think I should be aborted.” Bertram Roberts was meeting women who were sometimes a few dollars short, sometimes more, who couldn’t pay for their abortion, and so she would scramble to raise money. At first funding came through NOW, then in 2015 she established MRFF as a separate organisation. “It really came out of seeing people who didn’t have a taxi fare, who came hungry. The need is so great.” Sometimes accessing abortion would mean travelling for hours, and women would tell Bertram Roberts they had food for the trip, “but really, what they mean is they’re going to buy a box of cereal on their food stamps”. The reputation of MRFF grew; at one point, she says, it was getting 100 calls a week. “There’s just no way to get back to that many people, and we were out of money.” It had to close down for a few months to cope with the backlog. Now the MRFF gets about 20 calls a week, “and we’re able to help about half of those”. (Yellowhammer receives 50 to 60 calls a week.) The majority of women who access the services, she says, “are low-income or working class and already have kids. They understand the decision that they’re making. And some folks just don’t want to have kids.” They have included women whose sterilisation surgery has failed. “People who were using contraception and it failed, people who had their contraception sabotaged, young people who are preyed upon or assaulted, grandmas who thought they were in menopause. People who get abortions are the people you know. That’s what I’ve learned doing abortion care.” Abortion, she says, is simply part of wider reproductive healthcare. “You never know when a pregnancy that is going as planned will turn into a pregnancy where you need abortion care. The bravado that some people have to think, ‘It could never be me …’ I didn’t choose to need an abortion at 17. I was a fully pro-life, never-have-an-abortion person and then almost died because no one would give me one.” Ultimately, she says, nobody should have to feel like a choice was made for them. “You should have support whether you choose to parent, or have an abortion.” She smiles, clearly frustrated by the fight but ready for it. “I don’t see what the issue is.

5/12/2022,"Protais Mpiranya was pursued to his grave by a small but relentless posse of seven UN investigators and analysts known as the tracking team. The unit has played an essential role in finding all but a handful of the 93 accused war criminals indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). A similar tracking team worked for the parallel Yugoslav tribunal (ICTY), and by 2011 had helped bring to justice, or otherwise account for, all 161 of those charged with war crimes from the Balkan wars. Few UN operations can boast such striking success rates with such few resources, and the team’s advocates argue the methods and lessons learned by the two ad hoc tribunals, and the “residual mechanism” that followed them, should not be allowed to go to waste if there is to be any hope of delivering international justice for war crimes in the future. The International Criminal Court, at present, has no comparable unit. When the Yugoslav and Rwandan tribunals were established in 1993 and 1994 respectively, there was no model for how to hunt war criminals. In the Nuremberg tribunal, the defendants had almost all been caught by the allies occupying Germany, so there was little need for trackers. That did not apply in the Yugoslav and Rwandan cases. “One thing is absolutely clear, that we didn’t fully appreciate when this started in the 90s: you should really assume that every person indicted is going to be a fugitive,” said Kevin Hughes, the chief of staff in the mechanism’s prosecutor’s office and co-leader of the tracking team. “These guys are not just waiting around to be arrested.” The tribunals’ first tracking teams were led by veterans of military and police intelligence, with experience of handling informants and conducting surveillance. That worked for the low-hanging fruit among the fugitives, the careless and unlucky. But as others sought haven from sympathetic governments – many Hutu genocidaires initially flocked to Cameroon for example – it became clear that diplomatic skills would be required, to cajole and pressure those governments into cooperation. The tracking teams also brought in analysts able to find patterns in the huge amount of data generated by the investigations, and to dig deeper into the worlds in which the fugitives lived. By the time the Rwanda tribunal was wound up at the end of 2015 and its last cases were handed over to the residual mechanism, just eight of the 93 indictees were still at large. But among them were some of the most important figures behind the genocide, and the pursuit showed signs of flagging. Serge Brammertz was brought over from the ICTY to be the chief prosecutor under the mechanism, with responsibility for Rwanda. The Belgian lawyer, who had overseen the capture of Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, brought some of the ICTY team with him and a fresh approach. They found the investigations were drowning in a sea of data and leads generated by more than 80 paid sources, who had sent the trackers chasing their tails around the world. Under Brammertz, the payments were stopped and the number of informants shrunk to 10. Then the trackers went back to the case files, stripping out dubious tips from questionable informants, and interviewed or re-interviewed witnesses, looking for ways to establish more detailed profiles of the wanted men. “You have to be able to investigate the whole narrative of your fugitive and the whole arc of your fugitives. We needed to understand his complete story. We need to understand his family and his associates,” said Ewan Brown, a former British army officer and the tracking team’s other co-leader, who has also investigated war crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Darfur. “To do that effectively we need creative thinkers exploiting creative sources.” Over the past two years, the team has steadily crossed the last major fugitives off its list. Felicien Kabuga, a Hutu businessman whose radio stations had stoked hatred of Tutsis and who imported half a million machetes on the eve of the genocide, was caught in Paris on 15 May 2020. The remains of former defence minister Augustin Bizimana were identified in Congo-Brazzaville on 22 May 2020. After that Mpiranya was their most wanted man, the last of the big fish. Five more junior fugitives remain, but Brammertz’s team is confident of more breakthroughs in the near future. The main lesson from the 20-year manhunt for Mpiranya, the trackers say, is to start laying the ground for the hunt as soon as you start investigating the crime. “An investigative approach from the very beginning is what we really recommend now as being the way forward,” Hughes said. “Some of these things could have probably been closed earlier, because you would have already been asking questions in 1994.”",News/World news,The Hunters: the small UN unit that tracked down Rwanda’s worst killers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/the-hunters-the-small-un-unit-that-tracked-down-rwandas-worst-killers
5/12/2022,"Cryptocurrencies, according to their most ardent supporters, are supposed to supplant nations existing’ currencies and end central banks’ control over the money supply. Instead, individuals will be able to trade with each other in a decentralised, digital financial ecosystem. This is a good thing, they promise, because unlike states and their central banks, technology is incorruptible. Crypto-evangelists imagine technology as a replacement for social and political institutions. But technology never replaces social and political behaviour; it merely alters the rules and norms we follow. To see this in action, one need only look at the plummeting value of Terra Luna, a crypto token that crashed by 98% in a day, causing some investors to lose their life savings; the plunging value of Bitcoin and Ethereum; or the countless scam victims whose non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been stolen. NFTs use the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, to trade algorithmically generated illustrations that riff on a theme. On offer are cartoony Bored Apes, Lazy Lions and “CryptoDickButts”. Although NFTs are aesthetically uninspiring, they can sell for as much as $91.8m – and as they have grown in value, scams involving stolen NFTs have abounded. Just last month the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s Instagram account was hacked, and the perpetrators stole about $3m worth of NFTs by directing followers to a fraudulent site. When a scammer steals a CryptoDickButt, all the ecstatic manifestos about the decentralised power of the blockchain disappear, as scam victims plead with the handful of crypto exchanges to block the sale of their stolen NFT. The underlying technology and its tokens might be decentralised (and even that claim is questionable, given that cryptomarkets are wildly concentrated in the hands of a few hundred people), but where you can actually buy, use and sell these things is still limited to a few services and exchanges. This forces crypto fans to recognise a hard truth: currencies and contracts are only as valuable or enforceable as the people and institutions that recognise their legitimacy. Blockchain technology does not change this fact whatsoever. In turn, states and institutions have begun to treat crypto as a potentially destabilising geopolitical force, capping and taxing the ravenous amounts of energy that crypto mines consume. The crypto mining industry already consumes 0.55% of global energy production – about as much as a small country. Some have gone so far as to put the kibosh on blockchain technology altogether. China effectively banned the mining and use of cryptocurrencies in late 2021; prior to that, the country was far and away the largest bitcoin miner by volume, accounting for as much as 75% of global volume in September 2019. Its reasons for banning crypto are likely a combination of curbing the power consumption of crypto mines, protecting citizens from scams and controlling the flow of money both within the country and with China’s trading partners. To date, China is the only government that has made an aggressive move towards ridding itself of this technology, but other nations face similar problems. Russia has been learning this lesson in the last few months, starting in January when crypto miners set up shop in nearby Kazakhstan after getting kicked out of China. Their mining servers took a heavy toll on the central Asian nation’s electricity grid, using as much as 8% of its total energy-generating capacity as they swiftly became the second-biggest crypto producer behind the United States. Despite efforts to control the industry through energy taxation, citizens in Kazakhstan rioted over high fuel prices and unreliable electricity. Russian and neighbouring nations’ troops were called in to quell the violence in January, even as most of their attention was focused on Ukraine. The war in Ukraine is proving to be different but an equally decisive moment for the geopolitics of crypto. The vice prime minister of Ukraine, Mykhailo Fedorov, announced on 3 March that his government would issue an NFT to raise money for the war effort. So far, the Ukrainian government has raised $50m-worth of crypto since the war began, though there has been little reporting on exactly who is raising money for arms in Ukraine this way. Alex Bornyakov, deputy minister of digital transformation of Ukraine, has only said that “most donations come from people,” while others come from companies. Russia itself is a big player in crypto, supplying 11% of the world’s Bitcoin mining capacity. Oligarchs in the country must be grateful, given that trading between the Russian rouble and crypto assets has doubled since the assault on Ukraine began. Getting around sanctions by converting rouble to crypto assets seems to be working for now, but that might end soon. Just as scam victims are quick to request that NFT trading sites blacklist a stolen Ape, crypto exchanges are under pressure to bar Russians from their platforms. There’s been robust debate in the industry as to whether this is antithetical to the whole idea of the technology, but the point is this: crypto has not brought about a financial revolution, it’s just given states and scam artists a new piece to play on the grand chessboard. This is only the beginning. Churning out inscrutable financial assets using coal-powered electrical grids is contributing to a rapidly warming planet that is already experiencing the worst droughts seen in more than 1,000 years in California and supercharged monsoon seasons in India. All the ethereal imagery associated with crypto obscures the fact that it is made up of millions of tons of coal, copper, rare earth metals and plastic. The servers that mine crypto exist on the planet in real countries with laws, wars and resource shortages – which are governed by politicians that have real commitments and interests. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we are beginning to see an emerging geopolitics of crypto that looks very much like the old world of banking and finance.

5/12/2022,"Healthcare providers have issued a stark warning that failure to form an executive at Stormont will worsen Northern Ireland’s health care crisis and endanger patients’ lives. Representatives of doctors and nurses made the intervention on Thursday in a tacit appeal to the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to not derail the formation of a new administration on Friday. “Our health service is on the verge of collapse,” said a joint statement from the Royal College of Nursing, the British Medical Association Northern Ireland, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, and the Royal College of GPs. The five organisations said a political impasse would disrupt planning and cripple the ability to fund elective care, mental health and cancer strategies. Stormont is to meet on Friday a week after Sinn Féin overtook the DUP as the biggest party, giving it the right to nominate a first minister. “We are appealing to our newly elected representatives to put our health service first, form an executive without delay,” said the statement. “We have the longest waiting lists in the UK, emergency departments are overflowing, general practice is in crisis, and we have chronic workforce shortages, alongside burnt-out staff who are contemplating leaving the health service for ever. The situation could not be more serious.” The DUP made no direct response to the appeal but its MP, Sammy Wilson, said the party still planned to block a new executive unless the UK government addressed its concerns over post-Brexit checks on goods entering the region from Great Britain. Power-sharing rules mean there can be no executive without DUP participation. “Being inside the executive would require us to implement the agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol, something which we believe damages our constitutional position, removes the democratic decisions from Stormont and is damaging our economy,” he told the BBC. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has warned the EU the UK may scrap parts of the protocol but the DUP wanted to see concrete action, not just words, said Wilson. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, has said the party may block not only an executive but also the assembly when Stormont meets on Friday, a move backed by militant elements within unionism, including the Traditional Unionist Voice, which siphoned votes from the DUP in the election. Moderate unionists have condemned the looming impasse as reckless, as has the centrist Alliance and nationalists. Most of the assembly’s 90 members endorse the protocol as the least worst way to deal with Brexit. “The DUP’s attempt to hold the North to ransom until they get their own way on the protocol cannot be allowed to continue,” said Colum Eastwood, the MP and Social Democratic and Labour party leader. “Their selfish actions show their contempt for families in our communities who are struggling to heat their homes, put food on the table and petrol in their cars during the current emergency.” A report on Thursday from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) undermined DUP claims that the protocol was hurting the economy. It said the Northern Ireland economy outperformed the UK average and had recovered to pre-pandemic levels. “This is partly an outcome of the Northern Irish protocol and its special status in the Brexit arrangements, including better trade and investment conditions as part of the EU’s single market and customs union.” Grace periods on some border checks have delayed the full impact of the protocol.",News/UK news,"Stormont stalemate risks patients’ lives, medical leaders warn",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/12/stormont-stalemate-risks-patients-lives-medical-leaders-warn-northern-ireland-nhs
5/12/2022,"They think it’s all over … it is now. The lucrative corporate marriage that brought us 30 years of annual football simulations, and made billions of dollars in the process, is now defunct. Fifa and Electronic Arts (EA) have parted ways. And now the dust has settled on a day of frantic press releases, hype and guarded interviews, what sort of challenges face both entities as they jostle to reclaim the future of the footie sim for themselves? Here’s my pretty safe bet: Fifa is going to have a tough time of it. Now freed from the exclusivity clause granted to EA, the company apparently has a range of “non-simulation” games due out this year from various developers. It’s likely these will be casual titles, probably for smartphones, crammed with micro-transactions and perhaps aimed at the huge Asian market for arena-based multiplayer games. If there’s a plausible Fifa: Clash of Teams game, perhaps with some NFTs thrown in, you can bet someone is working on it. Fifa has claimed it will have a full Fifa football sim out in 2024, with president Gianni Infantino making a blustering promise that it will be “the only authentic, real game” and “the best one available for gamers and football fans”. This is, patently, a ludicrous piece of hubris, showing no understanding of modern video game development. EA’s titles represent the culmination of 30 years of sports sim development with a huge, dedicated and extremely experienced team. Where else is Fifa going to find that sort of expertise? It could partner with Konami’s Pro Evolution studio (especially considering the difficult start for the latter’s current series, eFootball), but then Konami hasn’t really challenged EA’s Fifa games in more than a decade. At the same time, it’s hard to imagine any other large, established development studio in the world pivoting to sports sims in such a short space of time. What about 2K games? It has the respected NBA 2K licence and its Visual Concepts studio has experience with basketball and American football – it even worked on the Madden series in the mid-1990s, so there are transferable skills here. But even then, making the best footie game available with barely two years’ dev time from a cold start? I don’t think so. If Fifa is hoping to ride this out on brand recognition alone, it has another think coming. In 2003, Championship Manager was one of the biggest brands in sports gaming. Published by Eidos Interactive and developed by Sports Interactive, it was an institution. But in 2003, the two companies split, allegedly due to differences over royalty negotiations and the fact that both wanted more control over the franchise. What happened next should be instructive for both EA and Fifa. Sports Interactive signed a new publishing deal with Sega and bought the rights to Kevin Toms’ vintage sim brand, Football Manager. “The team in place at SI were the team behind the game, we had the database and we’d spent the previous decade plus building the community,” recalls Sports Interactive CEO Miles Jacobson. “We were the ‘owners’ of all of those things. And the sum of those is way more important than the brand – even back in those days where the internet wasn’t as ubiquitous as it is now. “I’d be lying if I said we were never worried about it. We were confident, but not arrogant. It took a lot of work not just from us, but also our partners at Sega.” Eidos, meanwhile, set up a new team, Beautiful Game Studios, to take over work on Championship Manager, no doubt thinking the brand would make up for the relative lack of experience. The resulting game, Championship Manager 5, was released a year late and riddled with bugs, and despite four subsequent iterations and a brief afterlife as a mobile game brand, the series never got close to challenging Football Manager as a serious sim. Whomever Fifa partners with for the next “official” Fifa game, if the quality’s not there, it’s unlikely to succeed. One thing is certain: this heralds the end of an era, not just for the Fifa games but for the very idea of selling big tentpole video games on annual physical discs. Konami hasn’t had huge success converting its Pro Evo series into a free-to-play service, but that won’t deter Electronic Arts from exploring live subscriptions for its future football games. No doubt the corporation has plans for a football metaverse, in which the game sits alongside livestreamed matches, influencer broadcasts and lots of expensive customisation options. Beyond the final whistle, this messy breakup is going to have ramifications that spread out across the industry.

5/12/2022,"The world’s leading energy economist has warned against investing in large new oil and gas developments, which would have little impact on the current energy crisis and soaring fuel prices but spell devastation to the planet. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), was responding to an investigation in the Guardian that revealed fossil fuel companies were planning huge “carbon bomb” projects that would drive climate catastrophe. He said countries must seek to replace Russian oil and gas in the near term without damaging their long-term prospects. “I understand some countries may look at new fossil fuels but they should remember it takes many years to start production,” he said. “[Such projects] are not the solution to our urgent energy security needs and they will lock in fossil fuel use.” Revelations by the Guardian show nearly 200 carbon bomb projects are in planning, or have already started pumping, that will result in at least 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes, equivalent to about 18 years of current global emissions. Companies pursuing such developments could end up with uneconomic stranded assets, Birol warned. “If the world is to succeed in moving to net zero, these projects may fail to recover their upfront development costs,” he said in an interview with the Guaridan. Soaring global energy prices have led governments to seek new sources of fossil fuels. “I do understand why countries are reacting like this,” he said. “But there is the issue of the time horizon.” Big new exploratory projects for oil, gas and coal would take years to produce any fuel and could lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades, Birol warned. “The most suitable projects are those with short lead times and quick payback periods, such as expanding production from existing fields,” he said. Using existing sources more efficiently would also help reduce emissions, Birol noted. He said governments must also urgently seek to reduce fossil fuel demand, through home insulation, cutting speed limits, making public transport cheap or free and introducing car-free days in cities. “If we do not have these voluntary measures, I’m afraid that energy rationing may be on the table,” he said. Birol said unlike in previous oil shocks, such as those of the 1970s, the world now had cheap alternatives available in the form of solar and wind power, which had plummeted in price. This should prompt governments and companies to push harder for renewable energy. “I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point to a cleaner and more secure energy system,” he said. “This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind the change to clean energy. “The world does not need to choose between solving the energy crisis and climate crisis, we can do both.” The UN secretary general also called for an end to new fossil fuel projects, warning that climate change posed “an existential threat to us all – to the whole world”. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, António Guterres said: “Main emitters must drastically cut emissions, starting now. This means accelerating the end of our fossil fuel addiction and speeding up the deployment of clean renewable energy.” The IEA advised almost exactly a year ago that no new gas, oil or coal development could take place from this year onwards if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. That finding caused shockwaves among governments in the run-up to the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where leaders agreed to bring forward national plans in line with the 1.5C limit. But many countries, and private sector companies, have ignored the advice, as the Guardian’s investigation of fossil fuel projects under development has shown. These carbon bombs would in effect eliminate any hope of staying within the 1.5C threshold. Greg Muttitt, an energy expert at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: “Governments and companies often suffer from a form of cognitive dissonance: while recognising the urgency and severity of the climate threat, they still keep developing new oil, gas and coalfields and mines that will worsen the problem. The policy answer is a simple one: when in a hole, you need to stop digging.” Greenpeace said the Guardian’s investigation revealed the “fossil fuel industry’s business model remains a blueprint for climate catastrophe”. “Investment plans by oil and gas firms will blow us past every assessment of what is safe for the climate, and that’s shocking,” said the group’s senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick. “But what’s truly shocking is that they are not hiding it. These activities are legal and in fact are encouraged by governments around the world, particularly the ones that have the biggest reserves and the most to lose.” Caroline Lucas, an MP for the UK’s Green party, said in response to the Guardian’s investigation: “Governments seem intent on sending us towards our own destruction. How many more times must we tell fossil fuel companies to #keepitintheground?” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: “The answer to a global fossil fuel crisis cannot be to double down on fossil fuels. Every country must go further to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy. “That’s the right response to the climate crisis, but it’s also the right response to the cost of living and energy security crises too – with renewables now by far the cheapest and most secure form of energy. “Governments around the world should be urgently investing in a green energy sprint to shift decisively off destructive, expensive, and volatile fossil fuels for good.”",News/Environment,"No new oil and gas mega-projects if world is to avoid climate chaos, says IEA chief",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/oil-gas-mega-projects-climate-iea-fatih-birol-carbon-bombs-global-energy-crisis-fossil-fuel
5/12/2022,"Finland and Sweden could apply for membership of the 30-nation Nato alliance within days, ending decades of military non-alignment in a historic shift triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here is a brief look at the background and implications of their decisions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a defensive military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US, UK and France to counter the threat of postwar Soviet Russian expansion in Europe. Its common security guarantee is based on article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and commits members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression. Both considered that joining the alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, and so have long pursued policies of neutrality, and then non-alignment, to avoid antagonising a major regional power. Finland’s concerns have been largely practical: it shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of rule by Moscow, and its army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding about 10% of its territory. A 1948 agreement of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with Russia isolated Finland militarily from western Europe, though the breakup of the Soviet Union and EU membership have since allowed it to step out of Russia’s shadow. Sweden’s opposition to Nato membership has been more ideological. Its postwar foreign policy has focused on multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament and it has long seen itself as a mediator on the international stage, running down its military after the end of the cold war. It has reintroduced conscription and boosted defence spending since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but many on the Swedish left remain suspicious of the US-led Nato’s agenda and argue that Nato membership will only increase regional tensions. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said last month that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “changed Europe’s whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic region. Essentially, many Finns and Swedes increasingly feel that joining Nato will help keep them safe when they face a plainly belligerent and unpredictable Russian leader. Polls show public support for Nato membership has trebled to about 75% in Finland and surged to about 60% in Sweden. Nato membership would mean that for the first time Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Both countries switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the EU. They are already Nato partners, taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence with the alliance. Finland already meets Nato’s defence spending target of 2% of GDP, while Sweden is on course to do so. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said they would be welcomed “with open arms” if they do apply and that the accession process would be quick, although formal ratification by all the alliance’s members could take several months. From the military perspective, the addition of Finland’s and Sweden’s armed forces would represent a major boost to Nato’s assets in northern Europe, filling a hole in the alliance’s defences by doubling the length of its border with Russia and improving security and stability in the Baltic region. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to take “retaliatory steps” to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin sees Nato not as a defensive alliance but as a threat to Russia’s security. He blames Nato for blocking his takeover of Ukraine and has demanded Nato troops be withdrawn from eastern Europe. It is unclear how he would respond if he considers the alliance’s expansion in northern Europe an existential danger. Finland’s president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make a formal decision on submitting an application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats have been split on the issue and are holding an internal consultation, with a decision also due on Sunday. The party is widely expected to back membership, giving an overwhelming majority of MPs in favour. Swedish media have said a final government decision will be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted shortly afterwards. Many analysts believe the two countries will apply simultaneously.",News/World news,Why are Sweden and Finland not yet in Nato and does the alliance want them?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/why-are-sweden-and-finland-not-yet-in-nato-and-does-the-alliance-want-them
5/12/2022,"Good morning. Republicans have blocked legislation in the US Senate that would codify the right to an abortion into federal law, in advance of an anticipated supreme court decision striking down the protections enshrined by Roe v Wade. The conservative Democrat Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, joined the Republicans in their unified vote to defeat the legislation by 51 votes to 49. “Sadly the Senate failed to stand in defense of a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body,” Kamala Harris, the first woman and woman of color to serve as vice-president, told reporters outside of the Senate chamber. Democrats moved quickly to stage the vote after a leak last week of a draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, indicated that the court’s conservative majority had privately voted to strike down Roe and subsequent rulings. “If we do not take a stand now to protect a woman’s right to choose, then mark my words, it will be open season, open season on our God-given freedoms,” majority leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech before a vote. Already, advocates of reproductive medicine are warning that in vitro fertilization treatment could be a “casualty” of some of the proposed anti-abortion laws that are emerging across the US. Finland must apply to join Nato without delay, its president and prime minister said, as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape European security and the Atlantic military alliance. Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin made the call in a joint statement, saying: “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.” The announcement comes as five diplomats and officials told Reuters that Sweden’s bid for Nato membership will likely follow soon after Finland’s. According to Reuters, Nato expects Finland and Sweden’s membership to be granted quickly, paving the way for an increased troop presence in the Nordic region during the one-year ratification period. Yesterday, a state judge struck down new congressional districts in north Florida, saying that governor Ron DeSantis, who drew the lines, had made it harder for Black voters to elect their chosen candidates. “I am finding the enacted map is unconstitutional because it diminishes African Americans’ ability to elect candidates of their choice,” circuit judge Layne Smith said, according to the Tributary.

A California not-for-profit this week concluded a project to collect litter beneath the top 25 feet of the surface of Lake Tahoe from the 72 miles of the lake’s shoreline. Scuba divers ended up pulling out a whopping 25,000 pounds of waster, including plastic bottles, engagement rings, 1980s Nikon film cameras, entire lamp-posts and … “no littering” signs. Internal documents reviewed by the congressional select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis have revealed how meatpacking industry representatives lobbied Donald Trump officials to downplay the threat of Covid-19 to plant workers, and to block public health measures. The end result was catastrophic and deadly: at least 59,000 workers at five of the largest meatpacking companies contracted coronavirus in the first year of the pandemic, of whom at least 269 died. Mike Lindell, the MyPillow chief executive and staunch Trump ally, is continuing his crusade endorsing big lie advocates for top offices in 2022 and spending lavishly on lawsuits to ban voting machines.

A new study published in the Energy Policy journal found that the US, the world’s largest extractor of oil, will release 140bn metric tons of planet-heating gases if fully realized, unleashing emissions four times larger than all of the planet-heating gases expelled globally each year – an act that will place the world on track for disastrous climate change.
