2/7/2022,"Navy officials on Sunday identified a Seal candidate who died after an intense training session known as Hell Week, and promised to investigate the episode that left a second sailor in hospital. Kyle Mullen, 24, of New Jersey, died in hospital in Coronado, California, on Friday night, the officials said, giving no cause of death. The other sailor is unidentified and remains in a naval hospital in San Diego in a stable condition.  The pair were among a group of recruits seeking to become members of the Navy’s elite sea, air and land team best known for killing terrorist leader Osama bin Laden in 2011. Neither was engaged in active training when they were taken ill, the Navy’s statement said, adding that the incident occurred several hours after the candidates successfully completed the basic underwater demolition segment of “Hell Week” training, which it said was “part of the first phase of the Navy Seal assessment and selection pathway”. In the missive released on Sunday, the Navy confirmed Mullen, of Manapalan, New Jersey, as the dead candidate. “We extend our deepest sympathies to Seaman Mullen’s family for their loss,” rear admiral HW Howard III, commander of the naval special warfare command, said. “We are extending every form of support we can to the Mullen family and Kyle’s classmates.” Hell Week training is part of a lengthy and rigorous selection process for SEAL candidates, following an initial seven to nine-week initial boot camp, and consisting of exhaustive underwater and parachute training. The program, according to the Seal website, “is designed to push you to your physical and mental limits”. The dropout rate is high, and only about 20% of recruits successfully complete the training that the Navy acknowledges is “brutal”. Up to 250 candidates each year go on to become Seals. According to USA Today, Mullen’s death is the first of a Seal candidate in training for six years. In 2016, Seaman James Derek Lovelace, 21, drowned in a pool training session, which was initially ruled a homicide by the San Diego medical examiner after hearing evidence that his head was repeatedly pushed under water by an instructor. Navy investigators later ruled that no crime was committed and declined to file charges, although NBC reported at the time that three Seal candidates had died in four consecutive training classes, and that Lovelace was the fifth trainee to lose consciousness in a pool exercise in four months. A post mortem examination later revealed that Lovelace had an enlarged heart, which contributed to his death. The Navy’s Seals unit was formalized by President John F Kennedy in 1962 after military leaders flagged the need for a highly trained maritime force to respond quickly to escalating situations or to conduct special operations. But elite US forces operating as Seals had a storied history before Kennedy’s administration codified the unit, taking a leading role in the D-day landings of 1944 and the invasion of Okinawa the following year.",News/US news,US Navy identifies Seal candidate who died after ‘Hell Week’ training session ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/us-navy-identifies-seal-candidate-dies-after-hell-week-training-session

2/7/2022,"When Danny Hunter took over as the chairman of Boreham Wood in 1999, he was working in the film industry as a prop master. He won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, he was a part of the team that made Stanley Kubrick’s Full Metal Jacket and there were plenty of James Bonds, too. Were any of the silver screen dramas as gripping and outlandish as this? In the prickly heat of the moment, surely the greatest in Boreham Wood’s 74-year-history, the answer had to be no.  Under the astute management of Luke Garrard, who has been at the helm since October 2015, Boreham Wood have established themselves in the National League, the top tier of the non-league game – and on a relative shoestring budget. They have gone close to promotion to the Football League, losing the play-off final to Tranmere at Wembley in 2017-18, and they are well-placed for another push this season. Garrard calls promotion the “Holy Grail.” This was La-La Land. Only three times previously have Boreham Wood taken a Football League scalp in the FA Cup – those of Blackpool in 2017-18, Southend last season and Wimbledon in the third round of the competition this time out. Those clubs were in Leagues One and Two. But in Boreham Wood’s first ever fourth round tie, this was Bournemouth – a club that has designs on promotion into the Premier League, which recruited heavily in January to help them there. Garrard’s team were deserved winners. They rode their luck at times towards the end but it was no siege. They had been the better team in the first half, Bournemouth shapeless and inviting boos from their support, with the goal coming on 38 minutes from the captain, Mark Ricketts – a precise low shot from the edge of the area after Bournemouth could not clear. Ricketts had been a youth-team player at Charlton when Scott Parker, the Bournemouth manager, was a star at the south London club. Bournemouth went close towards the end but it was not their day. They simply did not create enough. “We’re going to Wembley,” chanted the Boreham Wood fans. They are actually going to Goodison Park for a fifth round tie against Everton. Garrard had predicted that Parker would largely field the team that started at Yeovil – another National League club – in the previous round of this competition and he was right. Parker made nine changes from the Championship win at Barnsley last time out and yet he could still call upon players who pedigree dwarfed that of their opponents. There were debuts for the January deadline day loanees, Freddie Woodman and Nat Phillips, who have come from Newcastle and Liverpool, and it was always going to be vital for Boreham Wood to keep their focus as narrow as possible, to play the game and not the scale of the occasion, even if it was pinch-me time for the fans that had travelled. They were determined to enjoy it and how they howled for an early penalty when Josh Rees went over Phillips’ leg after an incision from the right-wing back, Kane Smith. So did Garrard and his staff. Was this to be the moment? It was not a foul. Boreham Wood’s wing-backs were under orders to push up, with Garrard not wanting to die wondering. Rees worked centrally, in front of the midfield but deeper than the wide attackers, Tyrone Marsh and Scott Boden, and Garrard could be extremely pleased at how his team settled. Parker could be unhappy at the first-half efforts of his team, his emotions getting the better of him on 36 minutes as they tried to play out from the back and it all looked rather laborious. Moments later, Boreham Wood had the goal and who could say that they did not deserve it? The spark came from Jacob Mendy, the left wing-back, who began his career within the Atlético Madrid youth team set-up. He burst to the byline to pull back a low cross, which produced a rushed and unconvincing clearance from the Bournemouth midfielder, Gavin Kilkenny. Ricketts was waiting and his low side-foot went through a crowd, kissed the inside of Woodman’s right-hand post and went in. In the technical area, Garrard tried to show little emotion before he threw the contents of a water bottle up and all over the place – a metaphor for how he must have been feeling inside. The boos for Bournemouth were loud when the half-time whistle went. Moments earlier, Lewis Cook had lifted high – Bournemouth’s only real effort of the first-half – to draw an ironic chant from the home crowd. Yes, they had mustered a shot but, more seriously, they were staring at humiliation. Parker introduced Ryan Christie and another deadline day loanee, Todd Cantwell, for the second-half – a sign of his urgency but where was it from his players? Woodman was almost caught out by a Ricketts cross that swirled towards the far corner and Boreham Wood dug in hard at the other end, their commitment epitomised by the centre-half, David Stephens, who gave no quarter in the challenge. Cantwell played on the right of Parker’s midfield three and he saw plenty of the ball. Bournemouth pressed more and more on to the front foot and, inevitably, they came on strong in the closing stages, as Parker made three more substitutions – including the introduction of his leading scorer, Dominic Solanke. Philip Billing lobbed high when played through by Christie on 76 minutes and then Taye Ashby-Hammond tipped a shot from the latter up and against the crossbar. Billing headed the rebound against the woodwork but he was offside and it did not matter when Jaidon Anthony put the rebound into the net. Deep into five nerve-shredding added minutes, Boreham Wood knew they had pulled it off when Solanke dragged a low shot just wide.",Sport/Football,Ricketts strike stuns Bournemouth and puts Boreham Wood in dreamland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/bournemouth-boreham-wood-fa-cup-fourth-round-match-report
2/7/2022,"Brendan Rodgers has apologised to Leicester City supporters for his team’s “embarrassing” 4-1 FA Cup defeat by Nottingham Forest that he said proved “why a lot of these players are not top players”. On a day when a fan from the Leicester end was arrested for running on to the pitch to attempt to attack Forest players celebrating after Joe Worrall’s goal made it 3-0, the visitors’ manager set up a confrontation with his ailing squad by accusing them of a lack of hunger.  The FA Cup holders, enduring a trying season in the Premier League, were humiliated at the home of their local Championship rivals who secured a fifth‑round tie at home against Huddersfield Town. Philip Zinckernagel, Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence also scored, with Kelechi Iheanacho pulling one back, in the teams’ first meeting for eight years. “The lads were brilliant,” Steve Cooper, the Forest manager, said. Leicester released a statement banning the pitch invader from their games for life. The FA confirmed it will investigate the incident in which Ryan Yates, Johnson and Davis pushed back against the offender who threw two punches. “The club is appalled by such behaviour and offers its apologies to Nottingham Forest and its players whose safety was compromised,” a Leicester spokesman said. Rodgers, who substituted his captain Youri Tielemans for the day for “performance” reasons, lambasted his players after the game. “It was an awful performance and I have to apologise to the supporters,” he said. “To come here, [for] the first game between the two sides for a long time, [with] a great atmosphere … in derby games you need authority and you need physicality. It was sadly missing from our performance. “I said it before about having changes in the squad. It’s a lack of hunger. That’s why a lot of these players are not top players. Because they can’t sustain it. That’s where my admiration of the really top players who can keep that hunger and desire – no matter how much they achieve. “I always judge it on the physicality of the team: the pressing, the aggression. When you stop getting it, you can’t quite get there, your time could be up.There are a lot of these players, between now and the end of the season, who need to prove that they are still worthy of being here.”",Sport/Football,Brendan Rodgers apologises to Leicester fans for ‘embarrassing’ defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/brendan-rodgers-apologises-to-leicester-city-fans-for-embarrassing-defeat
