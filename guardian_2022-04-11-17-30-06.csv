4/11/2022,"The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, says he “accepts responsibility” for a gaffe on the first day of the federal election campaign when he couldn’t state the national unemployment figure or the official cash rate. Albanese was asked on multiple occasions if he knew the figures during a press conference in the marginal seat of Bass in Tasmania at the start of the six-week campaign. “The national unemployment rate at the moment is, I think, it’s five point … four ... sorry I’m not sure what it is,” Albanese eventually said. Labor’s finance spokesperson, Katy Gallagher, was then asked to step in and she confirmed the unemployment rate was 4% and the cash rate was 0.1%. The opposition leader is expected to continue on the hustings in Tasmania on Tuesday morning, while the prime minister, Scott Morrison, will be campaigning in marginal seats in Sydney. Bass is held by the Liberal MP Bridget Archer on a 0.4% margin and is being contested by Labor’s former MP for the seat Ross Hart. Albanese had initially attempted to sidestep the question about the RBA’s cash rate, which has been at 0.1% since November 2020, saying: “We can do the old Q and A stuff over 50 different figures.” “The truth is that … the reserve bank have said that there’ll be multiple interest rate increases – regardless of who’s in government.” In an attempt to cauterise the mistake – which the Liberal party promptly made into a campaign advertisement attacking Albanese’s readiness to govern – Albanese later apologised saying he was “human but how he responded was a “test of character”. “Earlier today I made a mistake. I’m human. But when I make a mistake, I’ll fess up to it, and I’ll set about correcting that mistake,” Albanese said. “I won’t blame someone else, I’ll accept responsibility. That’s what leaders do.” He said his mea culpa was a mark of how he would approach the role if elected prime minister – seeking to draw a comparison with Morrison. “Will I be perfect? No, but I’ll tell you what I’ll be doing is this; if I ever do make a mistake, I’ll put my hand up. I’ll own it. I’ll take responsibility, and I’ll set about fixing it. That’s what I did today, and that’s the way that I would approach being prime minister of this country,” he told Sky News. Labor’s campaign spokesman, Jason Clare, backed Albanese saying “politics is not a pop quiz”. “Aussies are fair dinkum people. We don’t get everything right but when you take a mistake, you say ‘Sorry, I stuffed up, I will fix it’. That is what Albo did today.” The deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, also defended Albanese, telling the ABC “elections aren’t memory tests, they are tests of leadership”. However, the slip-up gave ammunition to the Liberal party’s campaign, which has been seeking to paint Albanese as an economic risk. Campaign spokesman Simon Birmingham said the error showed that Labor “can not be trusted”. “If you don’t know what the interest rate is, you can’t be trusted to put the right policies in place to keep them low,” Birmingham said in a statement. “If you don’t know what the unemployment rate is, you can’t be trusted to keep Australians in jobs.” Morrison, who was unable to answer a similar question about the price of bread and petrol at the National Press Club earlier this year, said the election was a choice between “strong economic management” and Labor – who “can’t be trusted to manage money”. “0.1% is the cash rate, it’s been there for some time,” Morrison said when asked to cite the RBA’s official rate. “The unemployment rate, I’m happy to tell you, is 4% and is falling to a 50-year low.” The prime minister was campaigning in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore, held by the Labor party’s Fiona Phillips on a 2.6% margin. He announced a $40m roads package for the Shoalhaven region alongside the Liberal party’s candidate, former state government minister Andrew Constance. Constance, who criticised Morrison at the time of the 2019-20 black summer bushfires saying he “got the welcome he deserved” when greeted by angry locals in Cobargo, would not be drawn on the earlier conflict between the pair. “We can’t reverse history here. The reality is, to the PM’s point, I am going to be fierce in my representation of the people of Gilmore. I won’t sit there as a wallflower, I will call it how it is,” Constance said. Morrison said he had been in Cobargo on a “difficult day” for the shell-shocked community, but he was happy Constance was on his team “because he calls it straight.” The prime minister was also on the defensive about the status of former education minister Alan Tudge, who Morrison claimed had stood aside from the front bench, but who actually remains in cabinet. Morrison said Tudge was not receiving a ministerial salary but was “technically” in cabinet because he “still has his warrant from the governor general”. “Alan has taken his own decision for family and health reasons to stand aside. He’s not being paid as a minister and I look forward to him returning because what he’s been doing in education has been very important,” Morrison told the ABC. Morrison was also asked to comment on reports that Rachelle Miller, the former Coalition staffer who was in a relationship with Tudge, had received a payout figure of $500,000. The prime minister said that it was “a private matter involving sensitive issues” and he had no visibility over the arrangement struck between Miller and the Department of Finance. “No one can make any assumptions about any findings because there have been none that have been presented to me, which suggests any impropriety on behalf of Mr Tudge,” Morrison said on Monday.",News/Australia news,‘I’ll fess up’: Anthony Albanese tries to make a virtue of not knowing unemployment or cash rate,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/ill-fess-up-anthony-albanese-tries-to-make-a-virtue-of-not-knowing-unemployment-or-cash-rate
4/11/2022,"On any given day I will spend a considerable amount of time tensing my muscles to the rhythm of the national anthem. I might be driving, in a meeting or writing to a deadline, but my muscles will be sending our gracious Queen victorious, happy and glorious, long to reign over us. Other times, I breathe in sync with the sound of traffic going past, bite my nails or pinch myself when I’m trying to complete a task, so that if my brain decides to abandon its instructions, the sensation will serve as a reminder of them. I often forget to buy food or take my medication, and often can’t recall whether I’ve showered or not. My email inbox currently has 18,485 unread messages. Still, I am luckier than most women with ADHD. I received a diagnosis at the age of seven after a school referral. But many women come to be diagnosed later, after decades of being called scatty or disorganised, plagued by guilt and anxiety. The latest NHS figures show that while more than 100,000 men were diagnosed with ADHD in 2019-20, just 33,000 women received a diagnosis. With diagnostic standards set by studies of boys and men – who tend to show symptoms such as hyperactivity, as opposed to the introverted and inattentive presentations more common in women and girls – we are often forgotten. That is changing – thanks in part to a growing ADHD positivity community online. There’s @the_adhd_femme_collective, @female_adhd and my favourite, @Iampayingattention. The latter is run by Jess Joy and Charlotte Mia, two young professional women with ADHD and autism who founded the account and its wider members’ platform because they wanted to create a space where people could get to know themselves, and find a community who are trying to do the same. Users share advice on strategies to help them thrive, and on how to find treatment routes. They run online body-doubling sessions where you can log on and complete a frustrating task alongside others with ADHD. Women suggest coping mechanisms for concentration, such as the Pomodoro technique, which splits up work time into smaller bursts of focus. Their positive narratives around ADHD help you to train yourself out of the guilt that comes with the inability to concentrate. The BBC radio DJ Phoebe Inglis-Holmes credits the account with helping her “unpick [her] incorrect, preconceived notions about being neurodivergent”. In contrast to the young women I see online now, I tried to conceal my ADHD for years. My sisters were sworn to secrecy at school, and I have spent much of my life in conflict with my brain, forcing myself into 9-to-5 productivity rhythms, chastising myself when my brain doesn’t comply. I did freelance jobs to avoid difficult office environments. The heart of the ADHD positivity movement though is about creating a shift away from seeing neurodivergence as a problem that needs curing, to seeing it as an asset. Trying to see my mind as an ally is a long-term goal for me: I still feel very guilty claiming ADHD as a label. As someone who’s co-founded a successful social enterprise and is publishing my second book this year, I secretly wonder whether people will think I’m making a fuss, claiming a stake in an identity that I don’t deserve when other people have it worse than me. I still catch myself wishing my brain would “work properly”. I’m having a baby this summer and worry that my attention-deficit will let them down too. My husband helps keep track of my prenatal appointments and is in charge of lists. When I catch myself thinking like this, I counter it by listing the ways I benefit from ADHD, which are many and varied. For starters, I don’t have the attention span for long-held grudges or neuroses. In contrast to obsessive compulsions, I often leave my door open with the keys in the lock and don’t think twice about it. This ends badly less often than you’d think and is quite a relaxed way to live. Being very aware that my brain cannot perform all the necessary tasks means I’m never too self-reliant. I’m good at celebrating those in a team who have skills that I don’t. I’m able to have multiple interests and have a go at anything. Because I’m bad at planning, my coping mechanism is to be really good at troubleshooting. Knowing my flaws makes me a good team player; it can be fun and positive being impulsive. Because I rarely feel wedded to a plan, I’m flexible – and am very happy to be guided by the enthusiasm and skills of others, which is quite an empowering way to be. Neglect of detail and structure means I find it easier to see the big picture, sweeping trends and new ideas. It also means I’m not able to comprehend some of the barriers and am comfortable challenging them. It makes me great at handling a crisis and working under pressure. My life is quite interesting because I don’t have a particularly thorough outworking of consequences. I’ll attempt things that are audacious without much thought. Last year, we bought two train carriages from a scrap yard to eventually live in. I helped to found REfUSE, a company that has challenged unjust food systems. This year I’m staying in communes, co-living spaces and eco-villages to write about non-nuclear living. Often my ideas fail, but I can easily move on as I don’t over-focus on failure. Narratives around neurodiversity are changing. Just as we’re realising that having all-white male boards in business and politics has led to weaker, un-critical governance, we’re realising that neurodivergence is an asset too. The gymnast Simone Biles has spoken publicly about her diagnosis and her use of medication, tweeting “it’s nothing to be ashamed of”; will.i.am has credited the condition with fostering the creativity that has helped him write music. Michael Phelps talks about how he used swimming to help him concentrate after his diagnosis aged nine. Those of us who had whispered these combinations of letters behind hands are now claiming them back – and if not quite holding them proudly now, then at least trying to. Mim Skinner is the author of the book Jailbirds: Lessons from a Women’s Prison and co-founder of REfUSE. Her second book Living Together, finding community in a fractured world will be published later this year Additional reporting for this piece by Ashleigh Dick",Opinion/Opinion,I’m a woman with ADHD – here are all the reasons why I'm proud of it | Mim Skinner,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/11/woman-adhd-proud-positivity-neurodivergence
4/11/2022,"Bereaved families are facing bureaucratic barriers, unsympathetic customer service staff and lengthy delays when trying to close the accounts of a deceased relative. The Cost and Bureaucracy of Dying, a report by campaign group Fairer Finance and the death notification portal Life Ledger, found that some customers’ accounts were accruing charges for weeks after their death. And some investment firms were continuing to apply platform charges until the account closure had been completed. Meanwhile, banks – including Halifax, Barclays and Bank of Scotland – charge unspecified fees that can exceed £500 for settling self-invested personal pension agreements, claiming they reflect administrative costs. Billions of pounds of assets remain stuck with banks, insurers and pension funds because of baffling red tape and a vested interest in stalling claims, the report claims. Of the 49 savings providers surveyed, 22 require relatives to queue on a phone line, or in a branch, to notify them of a death. The findings are borne out by readers who contacted the Observer after attempts to wind up a loved-one’s estate were thwarted by red tape and incompetence. When Ron McDowall’s wife died of a heart attack, he sent a copy of the death certificate to her credit card provider Virgin Money, but received no response. A follow-up call required him to negotiate numerous voice recognition prompts and a lengthy wait before he was connected to the bereavement team, which asked him to email the death certificate. Weeks later, the bank sent a statement declaring that the account was in arrears and would incur default and interest charges. When he contacted the bereavement team on the email address it had provided, he received an automatic reply informing him that the inbox was no longer monitored. “The lack of responsiveness and empathy from Virgin caused me great distress,” says McDowall. “The bank presented itself as an uncaring organisation which is difficult to communicate with, and does not follow up on requested actions.” After involvement from the Observer, Virgin Money admitted the charges had been made in error, apologised and issued a refund and compensation. Fairer Finance is urging regulators to simplify and harmonise protocols for after a customer dies, and to ban fees for closing accounts. Currently, there is no maximum timescale by which banks are required to respond to a request to close the account of a deceased customer. Companies differ widely on what processes they follow, and when a grant of probate is required to release funds – some may request it when there is £30,000 in the account, for example. A survey by consumer group Which? last year found that four in 10 respondents reported waits of more than three months for a deceased’s account to be closed. When Richard Sheldon requested information about the balances in his late father’s six bank accounts in order to apply for probate, he says going through needlessly complex procedures compounded his grief. “Each bank has a different process,” he says. “Most involved several lengthy telephone calls, but Marcus by Goldman Sachs insisted on a seven-page form, including a series of irrelevant declarations about indemnity and insolvency, and signatures from all three executors, which was a problem as one lives abroad.” Marcus says the form is designed to gather, in one go, the information needed to wind up accounts once probate is granted. It revealed the balance, and promised to simplify its procedures. In 2018 the Death Notification Service was launched by the financial sector to allow organisations to be notified via a single online form. Firms then respond with details of next steps. However, only 26 are signed up and those that are still require executors to follow their individual, sometimes onerous, verification procedures. Madeleine Farbrother used the service to notify Clerical Medical Insurance Group (CMIG), part of Lloyds Banking, of her mother’s death. “I was told they couldn’t find the policy, and was referred to the Lloyds bereavement team which advised me it only deals with policies less than 10 years old,” she says. “My three emails received automated replies stating they were very busy. I repeatedly rang to be informed that it would take 157 working days to provide me with an estimate of the policy’s value. Meanwhile, I was unable to apply for probate, couldn’t sell my mother’s flat on which I was incurring service charges, and faced having to pay council tax again.” After the Observer intervened, CMIG admitted a series of errors, including the claim that policies more than 10 years old could not be handled by its bereavement team. It apologised for Farbrother’s “unacceptable” experience, paid her £300 in compensation, and offered to reimburse any costs caused by the delays. Two other websites offer a one-stop notification service which goes beyond financial firms, and extends to banks, charities, subscription services and utilities. Life Ledger was set up by Ruth Blakemore, the chief executive of a charity, after it took nearly a year to close the accounts of her late mother. “I found my dad crying, surrounded by all the paperwork, after he’d spent two days trying to sort my mother’s affairs,” she says. “There couldn’t have been a worse time for him to climb this complex mountain of admin.” Settld offers a similar service. However, there is no obligation for firms to sign up to them. Fairer Finance is calling on the government to streamline the process by launching digital death certificates, and a digital identity for consumers to which all their accounts would have to be registered. “In today’s digital age, it should be possible to reconcile someone’s affairs after they die by completing nothing more than a single online form,” says Fairer Finance’s founder, James Daley. It also wants the financial sector to sign up to its dignity after death charter, which commits companies to minimising bureaucracy and closing accounts within 48 hours of receiving the necessary documentation. The Home Office says there are no plans for a digital death certificate. Financial services trade body UK Finance says it encourages members to abide by core principles to support bereaved families, including rapid, empathetic responses. The Financial Conduct Authority has issued guidance on the treatment of vulnerable customers, and says it will be carefully considering the recommendations of the Fairer Finance report.",Lifestyle/Money,Calls to end banks’ needless bureaucracy piling on the agony for the bereaved,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/11/calls-to-end-needless-bureaucracy-adding-to-agony-for-bereaved-families
4/11/2022,"Making games is a long old road – five years or more, often, from conception to actual release – and when Kenji Kimura was stuck for ideas on the game he was directing, Ghostwire: Tokyo, he would wander the streets of Tokyo for inspiration. Walking around the back alleys of Shibuya, where the city’s ultra-modern architecture rubs up against old shrines and traditional houses, he would imagine a Tokyo eerily emptied of people by a paranormal event; what it would look like, how it would feel. Then, a few years into the production of Ghostwire: Tokyo, something similar happened. Like many cities across the world, Tokyo was suddenly deserted as people were confined to their homes in the early stages of the pandemic. “It suddenly felt so spooky walking in the city, because we had to be afraid of a thing that we cannot see,” says Kimura. “If we needed to go somewhere, we wouldn’t deviate from the shortest path.” The team he was directing at Tango Gameworks moved from their Shibaura office to home-working, finishing off their game about a ghostly city while living in one. “In the worst moments of the pandemic, when we were locking down the city, it was very strange,” adds Masato Kimura, the game’s producer. “There was nobody walking the streets. It felt unreal. When you take the Yamanote train line it’s supposed to be packed, especially in rush hour, but there was just nobody on that train, even during commuting hours. Tokyo is such a populated city, but once you take all the people out of it, you start to get this sense of loneliness and melancholy.” In the game, a creeping fog erases the crowds in Shibuya, sweeping across the city and leaving piles of clothes in its wake. It’s an action movie and a ghost story, casting you as a young guy, Akito, who survived the paranormal event because he was possessed by a vengeful spirit. Sharing his body with this spirit, Akito finds that he can battle the headless schoolgirls, creepy faceless salarymen and other ghosts now at large in place of the human population. As players, we spend our time exploring the city in all its creepy, unsettling emptiness, defeating ghosts with magic, trying to track down Akito’s sister, and exploring the stories of the people who used to live there. Unlike many big-budget modern games it is a contained experience, taking 12 or so hours to finish, and the controlled scale means that every aspect of the game’s compressed Tokyo is astonishing to look at, from the posters in the windows of the convenience stores to the neon-lit streets to the imposingly tall buildings, full of aggressive yōkai – supernatural beings. Both Kenji Kimura and Masato Kimura, who are not related, credit Ghostwire’s striking atmosphere to Junya Fuji, the environment designer, characterising the special paranormal effects that he created as the game’s “secret sauce”. The project began as a sequel to The Evil Within, Tango Gameworks’ successful horror game from 2014, but it soon became clear that it was becoming its own thing. The city itself was the main inspiration; before there was any story, any characters, even any idea of how the game itself would play, the team had spent years iterating its eerie version of Tokyo. This is highly unusual in game development; the gameplay idea normally comes first, and everything else from art to music and story must fit around it. But this alternative approach gave the developers the freedom to get their vision of Tokyo right first, and see where that took them. Fuji says he had a key phrase constantly in his mind at this time: “This is not a horror game”. “How do we make something scary, uneasy, spooky, but not horror?” he says. “That ruled some things out – no gore, no bloodstains, those are horror game tools. Without using the usual things, how can we create this new sensation of uncomfortable, but still familiar? “About a year or so after the project started, we had another year to think thematically: what people would be in the city, what would their feelings and emotions be, and how would we capture those feelings and apply them to the city itself, if there were no people left? Without thinking too deeply about game systems, we tried to keep those feelings and emotions of those people at the core of the project.” “One inspiration was a movie Dark City: both the lighting, and the sense that something ominous was in that city, overcoming it,” adds Kenji. “We chose a place that people were familiar with, one of the first places that people imagine when they think about Japan – and from there we created this big incident, that people would disappear. From there, we were able to evolve the concept for this game.” Ghostwire’s Tokyo certainly is uncanny, and not just because of all the ghosts. It is a familiar place to most people with any connection to Japan, even if you’ve only seen it in movies or games or TV shows, and experiencing a version of it that’s this realistic, but also deeply wrong, gives me the heebs. “The city itself is our main inspiration,” says Masato. “If you’ve been here, if you’ve lived here, you know that Tokyo has a lot of super modern cutting-edge buildings alongside very old, traditional shrines and houses, and by walking a few steps you can feel like you’ve stepped into another world. “In this city, these wildly different things can be right next to each other. We wanted to capture that mix, strangely pieced together the way that Tokyo is, and put it into a game that emphasises and adds to it. We thought that could turn into something really interesting.” Ghostwire: Tokyo is out now on PlayStation 5 and PC",Arts/Games,‘It’s like stepping into another world’: how Covid affected the eerie city of Ghostwire: Tokyo,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/11/ghostwire-tokyo-tango-gameworks-covid-lockdown
4/11/2022,"In the opening scenes of Pelin Esmer’s heartwarming documentary, the sublime and the quotidian are beautifully intertwined. The tranquil sight of a group of older women enjoying a seaside dip is juxtaposed with a striking view of the Roman amphitheatre overlooking the deep blue ocean. Unassuming in appearance, the women quickly transform into thespians, taking over the ancient site and making it a rehearsal space for an amateur production of King Lear. Coming from an impoverished rural background, this unlikely peasant-women theatre troupe brings the magic of Shakespeare to remote Turkish villages where even the basic staple of drinking-water is nonexistent. Their performances often take place on school playgrounds, and are rudimentary in terms of costuming and staging. Wearing their own clothes, the women give Shakespeare a regional otherworldliness. And alongside the evident communal pleasure inspired by such events, the off-stage interactions between the performers and the villagers are equally fascinating. Zeynep, who plays Lear, confides her youthful hope of becoming a nurse, which was was quickly quashed by her father’s order that she must stick to raising goats. Performing has ignited a transformative sense of confidence in Zeynep, however. And the young girl she confides in has her own dream of teaching, though her future seems uncertain. The film’s freewheeling structure makes for a great intimacy with its subjects but it doesn’t help the viewer with the physical orientation of events, especially not those unfamiliar with the local geography. However, though modest in terms of visuals and scope, Queen Lear is an endearing ode to the collective power of art and a subtle call for gender equality in Turkey.

4/11/2022,"As we race towards the federal election on Saturday 21 May, one key pandemic-inspired question has cropped up – how will those who are Covid positive cast their vote? On Monday, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) announced it would roll out a telephone voting system for those subject to isolation orders. “We are working on a telephone voting option, which will be a first,” the AEC boss, Tom Rogers, told ABC Radio. With six weeks to go, the AEC is still fine-tuning the registration process but the digital engagement director, Evan Ekin-Smyth, said people with Covid would have three days to ring and get their vote in. “The key thing to note with this service is that it is only for the final three voting days – Thursday, Friday and election day,” Ekin-Smyth said. “Up until the Wednesday prior to election day, people are able to apply for a postal vote.” Voters with Covid will register and be issued with a unique code they use to cast their vote. They can then call the AEC, use the code to identify themselves and tell the official how they wish to vote. “The person taking the call will mark the ballot paper according to your wishes expressed on the phone,” Ekin-Smyth said. “This process will be supervised and scrutineers will be able to observe, as they can for all voting methods.” While the AEC does offer this for people who are blind or have low vision, Covid patients will have to study their ballot paper before they call. This will reduce wait times, as a senate paper can be over one metre long in some states. “We’ll be providing ballot paper recreations on our website for people to be able to study and come to us prepared on how they want to number their ballot paper – reducing call times and wait times,” Ekin-Smyth said. The AEC is employing thousands of new staff to run this operation so that when voters call they will be talking to a real person. “It will be limited in its eligibility criteria to people who have to isolate under health directions, and for the final three days only,” Ekin-Smyth said. The AEC is currently working with health authorities to determine whether or not close contacts who are isolated will be provided with an exemption to vote. “It will not be a smooth process,” Ekin-Smyth said. “The wait on the phone will be longer than the wait at a polling place. People need to plan their vote this election and ensure they only access services that they are eligible to access.”",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022: how to vote by phone if you are in Covid isolation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/11/australian-election-2022-how-to-vote-by-phone-if-you-are-in-covid-isolation
