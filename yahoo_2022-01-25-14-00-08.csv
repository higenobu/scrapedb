1/25/2022,"Neil Young has never been a fan of Spotify, withholding his own music back from the streaming service until 2019. An advocate for better-sounding digital music, Young was never a fan of the sound quality Spotify offered but eventually relented. It’s not like people couldn’t stream Young’s music—he has his own website with ridiculously high-quality digital versions of his entire catalog.
 Speaking of Neil Young’s website, earlier today, he posted an open letter to his management and record label, asking them to give Spotify an ultimatum. They can either have access to his classic song library or continue offering sentient tubs of whey powder a platform to spread COVID misinformation.

 “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” the note read. “Please act on this immediately today and keep me informed of the time schedule.” When someone asks for a schedule or is Neil Young, you know they mean business. If both? Forget about it. Rogan’s podcast, a Spotify exclusive and a leading cause of brain rot among American males aged 18 to 34, has frequently come under fire for platforming anti-vaccine advocates just as the United States edges ever closer to one million COVID deaths. “I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform,” he continued. “They can have [Joe] Rogan or Young. Not both.” Young joins a chorus of more than 270 doctors, nurses, scientists, and educators calling on Spotify to de-platform Rogan, who continues to refuse to spend eight years researching things like myocarditis. Spend eight years, Joe. In the open letter from these health care professionals, many of which actually know about myocarditis, they wrote: With an estimated 11 million listeners per episode, JRE, which is hosted exclusively on Spotify, is the world’s largest podcast and has tremendous influence. Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy. As noted, the letter is no longer accessible, so it’s unclear if a response from Spotify eased Young’s concerns or if his deal with Spotify is going the way of the Pono.",Politics/The AV Club,Neil Young gives Spotify an ultimatum: Him or Joe Rogan,https://news.yahoo.com/neil-young-gives-spotify-ultimatum-022500292.html
1/25/2022,"Over the weekend, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the world’s leading (translation: most dangerous) anti-vax conspiracy theorist, was one of many kooky speakers railing against COVID vaccines and mandates at a “Defeat the Mandates” rally in Washington, D.C. “Even in Hitler’s Germany, you could cross the Alps into Switzerland, you can hide in the attic like Anne Frank did,” said Kennedy Jr. “Today the mechanisms are being put in place that will make it so none of us can run, none of us can hide.” At the antivaxx rally in DC, RFK Jr. says that in the future ""none of us can run and none of us can hide"" because of Bill Gates' satellites and also 5G, unlike... the Holocaust.""Even in Hitler's Germany, you could hide in the attic like Anne Frank did."" pic.twitter.com/bRtmDBTxZl — Ben Collins (@oneunderscore__) January 23, 2022 The outrageous comparison was immediately condemned by a Twitter account belonging to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial Place and Museum, which was established in 1947 to preserve the memories of those lost—and what happened to them—in the concentration camps during the Holocaust. “Exploiting of the tragedy of people who suffered, were humiliated, tortured & murdered by the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany - including children like Anne Frank - in a debate about vaccines & limitations during global pandemic is a sad symptom of moral & intellectual decay,” they wrote. How Did John Stockton, the Most Boring NBA Legend, Become an Anti-Vax Weirdo? Their statement prompted a Twitter user to tag in Hines, saying, “You need to make a statement! Do you stand with your husband?” A day later, on Monday evening, Hines finally broke her loud silence on the matter, replying, “My husband’s opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues.” My husband’s opinions are not a reflection of my own. While we love each other, we differ on many current issues. — Cheryl Hines (@CherylHines) January 25, 2022 Kennedy Jr.’s decision to compare COVID vaccine mandates—or the choice to get a vaccine in order to prevent the spread of a very deadly, very contagious virus—to the systematic annihilation of Jews during the Holocaust is particularly galling given that the hit show Hines stars in, Curb Your Enthusiasm, is populated by a cast of Jewish actors/characters, including star/creator Larry David, and is one of the most culturally Jewish programs in TV history. Then again, there’s no bottom to Kennedy Jr.’s anti-vax crusade. One year prior to his Holocaust rant, he falsely tied baseball legend Hank Aaron’s death to the COVID vaccine.

1/25/2022,"Several U.S. states sued Google on Monday over what they call deceptive practices in location-tracking. Texas, Indiana, Washington State and the District of Columbia all accuse the tech giant of invading users' privacy. The bipartisan suit accuses Google of falsely leading customers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow them to protect their privacy. But instead, the suit alleges, Google continues to systematically surveil its customers and profits from their data. Google has been quick to respond. Spokesperson Jose Castaneda said the case was based on ""inaccurate claims and outdated assertions"". He added ""we have always built privacy features into our products and provided robust controls for location data. We will vigorously defend ourselves and set the record straight."" A similar case was filed against Google by the state of Arizona in 2020. It alleged the U.S. firm used “deceptive” and “unfair” practices to obtain the location data of users. That lawsuit is pending.",Business/Reuters Videos,U.S. states sue Google over location-tracking,https://news.yahoo.com/u-states-sue-google-over-044737254.html
