1/5/2022,"Experts are keeping a wary eye on yet another COVID-19 variant, this one with 46 mutations. It was detected in France and showed up in a traveler who recently arrived from a three-day stay in Cameroon, French researchers said in a pre-print study published on medRxiv, which means it has not yet been peer-reviewed. While researchers were monitoring the strain to ascertain how infectious it is or whether it poses a danger, experts emphasized that its discovery alone was not cause for alarm. Moreover, it was noted even before omicron took over the world stage and “has been on our radar,” WHO incident manager on COVID Abdi Mahamud said at a press briefing in Geneva on Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. “That virus had a lot of chances to pick up.” So far, indications are that it hasn’t. But it did manage to infect 12 people in Marseille, in southeastern France. The 46 mutations had not been detected in other countries, The Independent noted. The person infected with the B.1.640.2 variant, dubbed IHU after being discovered by scientists at the IHU Mediterranee Infection, was fully vaccinated and had just returned from a three-day trip to Cameroon when they tested positive, the researchers said. Any speculation or alarm would be premature, the researchers said. ______",Health/NY Daily News,New COVID variant ‘IHU’ with 46 mutations detected in France,https://news.yahoo.com/covid-variant-ihu-46-mutations-031400156.html
1/5/2022,"North Korean state media has claimed Kim Jong-Il invented “wheat wraps,” which closely resemble burritos.

In a propaganda video from Pen News, a street food stand outside the Kumsong Food Factory in Pyongyang was shown selling “wheat wraps” to people, including children and soldiers. More shots displayed an industrial kitchen with trays full of filling, which appeared to contain vegetables like cabbage and carrots. Spinning meat resembling an al pastor trompo could also be seen in some shots.

 

It is unclear who in North Korea has access to the burrito-adjacent “wheat wraps.” North Koreans have historically faced food shortages, with the COVID pandemic increasing food instability in the country. Farming issues and vulnerability to climate change may create additional problems for people there.

While the more precise origins of the burrito are undetermined, they are known to have originated somewhere in Mexico and have existed since at least the 1900s, growing popular in the U.S. in the 1950s.

1/5/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday canceled a news conference he had scheduled for Jan. 6, the one-year anniversary of his supporters' deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol.    Trump said in a statement that he would instead discuss many of the same topics he would have addressed at the news conference at a rally in Arizona on Jan. 15.    Thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in the worst assault on Congress since the War of 1812. Fueled by Trump's false claims that his November 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud, the rioters tried to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's victory.  One police officer who responded to the scene died the day after the attack, while four others who guarded the Capitol died later by suicide. About 140 police officers were injured during the hours-long attack. Four rioters also died. More than 700 people have been charged with joining in the assault.    The violence led to Trump's second impeachment and numerous investigations. One of them, in the House of Representatives, is seeking to question influential Fox News television personality Sean Hannity about text messages with Trump, his aides and his lawyers during that time.    (Reporting by Eric Beech and Makini Brice; Editing by Scott Malone, Leslie Adler and Grant McCool) ",Politics/Reuters,Trump cancels planned Jan. 6 news conference,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-says-canceling-jan-6-231500942.html

1/5/2022,"MSNBC primetime host Ari Melber and former Trump White House official Peter Navarro clashed in a wild interview Tuesday night over the latter’s steadfast attempt to overthrow the 2020 election results and upend a democracy. Melber teed up the segment with an old clip from former Trump strategist and Navarro sidekick Steve Bannon’s War Room: Pandemic podcast of Bannon describing exactly how the duo sought to overturn the election. The clip, from Jan 6, 2021, shows firsthand how Bannon, along with Navarro, hoped to deploy their half-baked “Green Bay Sweep” plan of action to overturn the 2020 election results. In so doing, they would gain Republican House lawmakers’ support with the end goal of a successful objection to the 2020 presidential election verification. Trump Adviser Peter Navarro Lays Out How He and Bannon Planned to Overturn Biden’s Electoral Win The tense interview kicked off with Melber asking: “What was the plan, and who was in on it besides you, Bannon, and Trump?” Right off the bat, Navarro fired back by claiming he’d put together a report chock-full of evidence of election fraud. “I went over tens of thousands of pages of documents and proved that the election was in all likelihood stolen,” Navarro said, “through fraud and election irregularities.” Melber then jumped in, calling Navarro out over his unsubstantiated claim of election funny business. “That’s false,” the host declared. “That’s false.” Navarro responded: “You can say that’s false. That’s fine.” The MSNBC host got the last word in, saying, “Yes, it is fine!” Seeking to get the segment back on track, Melber asked, again, “What was the plan itself, and who was in on it?” The ex-Trump official replied with an equal parts long-winded and self-imploding answer that outlined his detained plan to overturn the 2020 election. “The [Green Bay] Sweep was simply that. We were gonna challenge the results of the election in the six battleground states. They were Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, Nevada,” Navarro said. “And basically, these were the places where we believed that if the votes were sent back to those battleground states and looked at again, that there would be enough concern amongst the legislatures that most or all of those states would decertify the election.” Without skipping a beat, on his MSNBC nightly program The Beat, Melber proceeded to ask: “Do you realize you are describing a coup?” The ex-Trump official refuted, “No. I totally reject many of your premises there.” In a late December interview with The Daily Beast, Navarro laid out in his own words just how the plot was designed to overturn the election. “The Green Bay Sweep was very well thought out. It was designed to get us 24 hours of televised hearings,” the ex-Trump trade adviser said. “But we thought that we could bypass the corporate media by getting this stuff televised.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/5/2022,"SYDNEY (AP) — Australia and Japan will sign a treaty on Thursday to increase defense and security cooperation in a move that has been hailed as “historic” but which might anger China. Prime ministers Scott Morrison of Australia and Fumio Kishida of Japan will meet in a virtual summit to sign the agreement, which Morrison said “will underpin greater and more complex practical engagement between the Australian Defense Force and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces."" “Australia and Japan are the closest of friends,” Morrison added. “Our special strategic partnership is stronger than it has ever been, reflecting our shared values, our commitment to democracy and human rights and our common interests in a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific region.” In September, Australia signed the so-called Aukus trilateral security pact with the United States and Britain under which those two countries pledged to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The deal upset China, which said that Aukus “seriously undermined regional peace and stability, intensified the arms race and undermined international non-proliferation efforts.” In a statement on Wednesday, Morrison described the latest treaty with Japan as historic and said “it will, for the first time, provide a clear framework for enhanced interoperability and cooperation between our two forces."" “This treaty will be a statement of our two nations’ commitment to work together in meeting the shared strategic security challenges we face and to contribute to a secure and stable Indo-Pacific,"" Morrison said. The U.S. and Australia, along with India and Japan, are also members of a strategic dialogue known as “the Quad,"" and Morrison said Wednesday that Australia would contribute “an expanding agenda” for that as well.",World/Associated Press,"Australia, Japan to sign 'historic' defense, security pact",https://news.yahoo.com/australia-japan-sign-historic-defense-042509244.html
