1/10/2022,"Rep. Maxine Waters said Rep. Matt Gaetz ""needs to shut up"" after he spoke about the Capitol insurrection. Gaetz said he was proud of the work Republicans did on January 6. The Florida congressman said some people made ""legitimate arguments about election integrity"" on January 6. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California had scathing remarks for Rep. Matt Gaetz after he made reflecting on the Capitol insurrection. ""We're ashamed of nothing. We're proud of the work that we did on January 6 to make legitimate arguments about election integrity,"" Gaetz said about the GOP on Steve Bannon's radio talk show. ""We're actually going to walk the grounds that patriotic Americans walked from the White House to the Capitol who had no intent of breaking the law or doing violence,"" Gaetz, a Republican from Florida, said alongside a nodding Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green. Waters said on MSNBC's ""The Sunday Show"" Gaetz's comments were ""absolutely outrageous."" ""The world watched what happened, and for them to try and rewrite history and to tell people 'don't believe your lying eyes' is absolutely outrageous,"" said Waters, who added that Gaetz ""better be concerned"" about what's happening in his sex-trafficking investigation. ""To get in our faces and talk about they had no intent of hurting anybody when we've got five of our Capitol police officers who are dead, 150 of them who have been harmed,"" Waters continued. ""We can't let them get away with it."" A Senate report found that five officers who served at the Capitol died in the days and weeks after the insurrection, the New York Times reported. The Times also reported that around 140 police officers were injured in the events. Some 738 people have been charged with crimes in connection to the Capitol insurrection, and 171 rioters have pleaded guilty. Waters said on MSNBC that it is not possible to work with some Republicans. ""I want my party to rise to this occasion and not try and think that somehow we are going to be able to work something out with them. They have defined themselves as liars, people with no integrity, and they are intent on protecting Trump, and they're all afraid of him,"" Waters said. ""They are not representing even their constituents, and so Gaetz needs to shut up,"" she added. Read the original article on Business Insider",U.S./INSIDER,Rep.

1/10/2022,"Rescue crews saved 27 people stranded on a large piece of ice floating off the shore of Point Comfort in Green Bay, police in Wisconsin said. The ice broke away from the shoreline, carrying dozens out over the frigid bay waters, according to the Brown County Sheriff’s Office. Police, firefighters and the Coast Guard responded the morning of Saturday, Jan. 8, the sheriff’s office said. “Barge traffic yesterday appears to have weakened the ice along the east shore of the Bay, therefore, the ice should be avoided for all recreational use,” the BCSO wrote in a Facebook post, warning others to stay clear of the area. One man caught on the ice floe, Shane Nelson, was ice fishing with a friend when a loud noise caught their attention, WLUK reported. “It sounded like, almost, somebody fired a gun out there,” Nelson told the TV station. “We thought it was interesting, got out of our shanty, took a look and people were yelling on the ice we’re separating.” Nelson and the other castaways were rescued in a matter of hours, ferried back to shore a boatload at a time, police told WLUK.
