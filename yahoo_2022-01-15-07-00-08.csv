1/15/2022,"By Lisa Richwine LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -Netflix Inc has raised its monthly subscription price by $1 to $2 per month in the United States depending on the plan, the company said on Friday, to help pay for new programming to compete in the crowded streaming TV market. The standard plan, which allows for two simultaneous streams, now costs $15.49 per month, up from $13.99, in the United States. Prices also rose in Canada, where the standard plan climbed to C$16.49 from C$14.99. Shares of Netflix gained nearly 3% to $533.84 on Nasdaq after Reuters broke the news of the price rises. They closed 1.3% higher at $525.69. The increases, the first in those markets since October 2020, took effect immediately for new customers. Existing members will see the new prices in the coming weeks when they receive their monthly bills. ""We understand people have more entertainment choices than ever and we’re committed to delivering an even better experience for our members,"" a Netflix spokesperson said. ""We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options. As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget,"" the spokesperson added. The world's largest streaming service is facing the most competition ever from companies looking to attract viewers to online entertainment. Walt Disney Co, AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia, Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc are among the rivals pouring billions into new programming. Netflix has added customers despite prior price increases, which shows its members have been willing to accept higher costs, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said. ""This is evidence that Netflix has pricing power,"" Mahaney said. Netflix had said it would spend $17 billion on programming in 2021. The company has not disclosed spending for 2022. The U.S. price of Netflix's premium plan, which enables four streams at a time and streaming in ultra HD, was increased by $2 to $19.99 per month. For Netflix's basic plan, with one stream, the cost rose by $1 to $9.99 per month. In Canada, the premium plan rose by C$2 to C$20.99, and the basic plan was unchanged at C$9.99. At $15.49 per month, the standard U.S. plan from Netflix now costs more than competitors. HBO Max, owned by AT&T Inc, is currently offering an $11.99-a-month promotion for 12 months. The price of Walt Disney Co's Disney+ is $7.99 a month or $79.99 a year. The United States and Canada is Netflix's largest region with 74 million streaming customers as of September 2021. The region accounted for nearly 44% of the company's revenue in 2021's third quarter, or about $3.3 billion. Most of the company's recent pickup in subscribers has come from overseas. Netflix's subscriber growth slowed from a boom early in the COVID-19 pandemic but rebounded with help from global phenomenon ""Squid Game,"" a dystopian thriller from South Korea released in September. Total global subscriptions reached 213.6 million. The company's next subscriber report is due Thursday when Netflix posts quarterly earnings. Analysts project the company will report 8.5 million new sign-ups from October through December, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data, bringing its global subscriber base to 222 million.

1/15/2022,"NFL star Ndamukong Suh has not missed a game to injury in his entire 12-year NFL career. The 35-year-old, 315 lb player maintains his durability through a strict lifestyle. Suh's daily routine includes intermittent fasting, kombucha, and a high-protein diet. NFL star Ndamukong Suh has managed to stay injury-free for his entire 12-year NFL career, and has done so at a weight of 315 lbs. The 35-year-old defensive tackle has started all 16 games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this year and continues to play at a high level in his late 30s, and he credits his strict lifestyle for his longevity. Suh said he follows a variety of wellness practices, including intermittent fasting, drinking kombucha every day, and a high-protein low-carb diet in an interview with GQ. ""When I started to take a holistic approach to my training, that's when I saw big payoffs,"" he told GQ. ""We really take a holistic approach as we go throughout a week."" As a follower of intermittent fasting, Suh follows a schedule that switches between periods of eating and periods of fasting. It's an eating strategy that doesn't put limits on what you eat, but rather when you eat. Intermittent fasting has been popularized as a weight loss technique, but for Suh, who maintains his 315-lb frame to be an effective defensive lineman, that isn't necessarily his objective. One benefit associated with intermittent fasting is reduced inflammation, a focus for professional athletes trying to avoid injury. When your body is in a fasted state, your glucose reserves are next to empty, which may reduce painful inflammation, Andrew Wang, MD, a professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, previously told Insider. Wang said the body produces less inflammation when burning ketones compared to glucose. Some studies have found that diets that promote ketosis can also alleviate inflammatory pain. Another potential benefit Suh gets from intermittent fasting is improved cognitive function — a key quality for older players who are not as nimble and fast as younger ones. A small 2016 study which tested amateur weightlifters after a 48-hour fast found that the those who fasted had improved ""mental flexibility,"" which was defined as participants' ability to quickly and efficiently switch between tasks, according to the researchers. Suh's eating period comes around mid day, so lunch and a pre-lunch snack are his biggest meals, according to GQ. For his pre-lunch snack, Suh will eat almond butter, hard boiled eggs, parfaits, and trail mix, which are all dense in protein. Suh said kombucha — a probiotic-rich, low-sugar alternative to soda — is also regularly featured in his pre-lunch snack. Kombucha is a fermented tea made by adding sugar and yeast to black or green tea. The probiotics in kombucha can establish themselves in your gut and help the healthy bacteria in your digestive system digest and absorb other nutrients, Vanessa Rissetto, RDN, co-founder of Culina Health, previously told Insider. Suh said his most common lunch is low-carb, like a salad with chicken or vegetables.

1/15/2022,"By David Shepardson and Tim Hepher WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it is proposing conditions that would allow FedEx to install a laser-based missile-defense on Airbus A321-200 airplanes. Delivery company FedEx Corp in October 2019 applied for approval to use a feature that emits infrared laser energy outside the aircraft as a countermeasure against heat-seeking missiles, the FAA disclosed in a document. A FedEx spokeswoman declined immediate comment about whether it is still pursuing approval for the application. FedEx does not currently operate any Airbus 321 planes. The FAA said it is still reviewing the proposal and will consider public comments. Airbus did not immediately comment. The airline industry and several governments have been grappling with the threat to airliners from shoulder-fired missiles known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or MANPADs, for decades. Some use infrared systems to target an aircraft's engines. ""The FedEx missile-defense system directs infrared laser energy toward an incoming missile, in an effort to interrupt the missile’s tracking of the aircraft’s heat,"" the FAA document said. The FAA proposed conditions before it would consider approving the system, including ensuring it will prevent the inadvertent operation while on the ground, including during maintenance. According to the U.S. State Department, more than 40 civil airplanes have been hit by MANPADs since the 1970s. Efforts to combat the threat accelerated after two missiles narrowly missed an Arkia Israeli Airlines Boeing 757 passenger jet on take-off from Mombasa airport in November 2002. Cargo planes have also been targeted. In 2003, an Airbus A300 freighter flown by DHL was damaged by MANPADs and forced to make an emergency landing in Baghdad. In 2007 and 2008, FedEx took part in a U.S. government trial of anti-missile technology for civil planes by installing Northrop Grumman's Guardian countermeasures system on some commercial cargo flights while BAE Systems said it had installed its JetEye system on an American Airlines airplane.

1/15/2022,"Last July, Republican candidate for governor Darren Bailey took to Facebook to denounce both the extension of federally-enhanced state jobless benefits and Democratic President Joe Biden’s visit to Crystal Lake to promote his coronavirus relief agenda. “Here’s the dangerous slope that we are on in America,” the state senator and farmer from downstate Xenia said, while discussing Biden’s visit. “That’s exactly what we heard: Free stuff. Handouts. Don’t worry about it, the government’s going to take care of you.” “Friends,” he said, “that’s socialism.” But only months before, on Feb. 26, Bailey received the latest of a series of payments from the federal government’s coronavirus business relief Paycheck Protection Program under the Small Business Administration — $231,475 to support 11 jobs at the family farm he owns with his sons. Less than a month later, on March 22, Bailey reported a personal loan of $150,000 to his campaign for governor, listing “Self-Employed (Bailey Family Farms)” as his employer on the required state campaign finance disclosure form. All told, records compiled in a database produced by investigative news agency ProPublica show Bailey’s family farm and two other entities he owns, Bailey Family Freight and the Virtue House Ministries Christian school run by his wife, received $569,045 in so-called PPP loans from April 2020 to February 2021. Additionally, Bailey Family Farms got $282,424 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program in 2020 to compensate farmers for COVID-19 related losses. As was the case with most PPP loans, Bailey’s loans were forgiven. Bailey’s campaign said Bailey and his farm, “like millions of hardworking people in Illinois,” were “tremendously impacted by the forced government shutdowns and resulting economic downturn.” “Like multiple businesses in Illinois, the Bailey Family Farm participated in the programs and abided by all the relevant rules,” Bailey’s campaign said in a statement. In addition to the PPP and Coronavirus Food Assistance payments, Bailey has received $2.1 million in federal agriculture corn, soybean, wheat and sorghum subsidies for his five-county farming operation since 1995, according to a database compiled by the Environmental Working Group, an organization backed by progressive money. Bailey’s campaign said the U.S. Department of Agriculture subsidies are determined by the federal government due to market factors including the influence of agriculture imports and exports. Bailey Family Farms, the campaign contended, gets less per acre in subsidies than the average farm in Illinois. Bailey’s rhetoric about socialism in his July Facebook post was consistent with comments he has made in railing against big government control — particularly over efforts to deal with the pandemic. He has repeatedly accused Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker of being a “tyrant” over business closures and masking and vaccine rules and mandates. Bailey made an unsuccessful legal challenge to Pritzker’s executive authority, and in May 2020 was removed from the House floor for failing to wear a required mask. He has refused to disclose his vaccination status. A member of the so-called Eastern Bloc of ultraconservative downstate lawmakers, Bailey has co-sponsored legislation to create a “New Illinois” state, separate from Chicago and its political influences on the region despite acknowledging it is impractical to accomplish. Bailey is not the only Republican candidate for governor to take part in the Paycheck Protection Program. Gary Rabine, a Bull Valley businessman who owns a Schaumburg-based paving and construction business group, received nearly $2.7 millioncovering seven different entities for 104 jobs in April 2020, the ProPublica database showed. Jesse Sullivan, a Petersburg entrepreneur, received $67,545 for his Alter Global firm to cover four jobs in May 2020. Paul Schimpf, an attorney and former state senator from Waterloo, did not appear in the database. But it is the timing of Bailey’s most recent PPP loan that prompts questions. Bailey announced his candidacy for governor on Feb. 22, four days before he received the second PPP loan for his farming operation, and exactly one month before he loaned his campaign $150,000. Usually, candidates give money to their campaigns at the same time they announce to demonstrate financial wherewithal for the campaign ahead. Rabine announced his candidacy almost a year after his last PPP loan while Sullivan’s candidacy came 16 months after his PPP loan. Under the SBA’s rules to obtain a PPP loan, borrowers “must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary” and “review carefully the required certification that ‘current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant.’ ” “Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support their ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business,” the SBA said. When asked why Bailey’s farm needed the PPP loan if he personally had money to give his campaign for governor, Bailey’s campaign did not directly answer the question. “Every penny was accounted for and reported accordingly. There is zero connection to these things and only the liberal press is pretending there is,” Bailey spokesman Joe DeBose said in a statement. While Bailey was critical of Biden and government handouts in his July Facebook post, DeBose said the primary message was to come out against Pritzker’s decision to extend federal supplemental jobless benefits, contending that doing so was “over-incentivizing workers to stay home, which created an economic mess that continues to devastate local businesses and families as inflation soars.” The extended federal jobless benefits ended in Illinois on Sept. 11. DeBose said Bailey and his office has and continues “to help Illinoisans apply and receive the help they need,” including pandemic-related business grants and loans as well as jobless benefits from the state Department of Employment Security, which had repeated problems in responding to a surge of requests for help due to the pandemic. “The elites and the fake news media can attempt to mislead people, but Illinois voters and working families know better” about Bailey, he said. rap30@aol.com Here are the links: Coronavirus Food Assistance Program database: https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/15429-coronavirus-food-assistance-program-where-did-the-money-go USDA federal subsidy database: https://farm.ewg.org/persondetail.php?custnumber=A03129520",Politics/Chicago Tribune,"GOP candidate for governor Darren Bailey got $231,475 federal paycheck loan in February.
