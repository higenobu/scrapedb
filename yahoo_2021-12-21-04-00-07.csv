12/21/2021,"The father of Rust cinematographer Halyna Hutchins holds Alec Baldwin ""partly responsible."" Anatoly Androsovych spoke to the tabloid the Sun after Baldwin said in his first TV interview earlier this month that he wasn't responsible for Hutchins's death and the shooting of director Joel Souza because the gun went off without him pulling the trigger. A live round was in the gun when it shouldn't have even been on the set and the 42-year-old director of photography was killed on Oct. 21. ""I can't understand the behavior of Alec,"" Androsovych said.  ""Why did he fire the shot during the preparations?"" he asked, referring to the gun discharging during rehearsal while Hutchins was setting up the camera for the shot. The lawsuit filed by Rust script director Mamie Mitchell claimed the script never called for Baldwin to fire a gun in the first place.  Hutchins's dad also noted what gun experts have said: ""The revolver is the type of gun which doesn't shoot before the trigger is pressed,"" Androsovych said, so ""Alec is partially guilty for causing that shot."" He continued, ""It is clear to me Baldwin fired the shot from his hand so it’s hard for me to understand how he cannot be held partly responsible for my daughter's death."" Androsovych also asked questioned why Baldwin deleted tweets after the shooting. Hutchins's father also spoke of his daughter's 9-year-old son, Andros, in the wake of the tragedy. He said he wasn't sure the child would ""ever fully recover."" ""Andros is slowly getting back to life, but this is [a] huge blow for all of us,"" he said. The investigation into the shooting continues. Last week, authorities were granted a search warrant to look through Baldwin's phone data. The actor, also a producer on the western, has been cooperating with authorities, he's said. Baldwin is named in two lawsuits so far related to the shooting. Other defendants are the production company as well as the 24-year-old armorer Hannah Gutierrez Reed and assistant director Dave Halls, both of whom handled the gun before Baldwin got it. Hutchins's husband, Matthew, retained counsel specializing in wrongful death lawsuits. In an interview with ABC News on Dec. 2, Baldwin said, ""Someone is responsible for what happened, and I can’t say who that is, but it’s not me. Honest to god, if I felt I was responsible, I might have killed myself."" In an exclusive interview with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos Thursday, actor Alec Baldwin discussed the accidental on-set shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins back in October, and what could be in store for his career, both short and long term, in the wake of the tragic event.
After candidly telling Stephanopoulos that he “couldn’t give a s**t” about his career anymore, the host asked him, “Is it over?”
“It could be, it could be,” Baldwin said. “If I decide that I -- I mean could I work? I'm gonna go make another movie in January. And I said to them, ‘Do you wanna get out of it? Do you wanna get rid of me 'cause of what happened?’ They said, ‘No.’ But I say to myself, ‘Do I wanna work much more after this? Is it worth it?’”
Since the incident happened, the 3-time Emmy winner says he’s been having very vivid dreams and hasn’t slept in weeks. But among the range of emotions he’s gone through, there’s one that he hasn’t been feeling. When Stephanopoulos asked if this is the worst thing that has ever happened to Baldwin, he answered “yes” without hesitation. Then Stephanopoulos asked Baldwin if he feels guilt?”
“No. No,” Baldwin said. “I feel that someone is responsible for what happened, and I can't say who that is, but I know it's not me. Honest to god, if I felt that I was responsible, I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible,” Baldwin said. “And I don't say that lightly.”",U.S./Yahoo Movies,Halyna Hutchins's father insists Alec Baldwin is 'partly responsible' for cinematographer's death: 'Baldwin fired the shot',https://news.yahoo.com/rust-halyna-hutchins-father-alec-baldwin-partly-responsible-death-170525969.html
12/21/2021,"Sen. Manchin doesn't want the child tax credit to go on in its current form — if it extends at all. A work requirement would ensure payments are ""accountable,"" Manchin told West Virginia's MetroNews. And harsher salary thresholds would make sure the aid reaches families that ""really need it,"" he said. The child tax credit will have to look dramatically different for Sen. Joe Manchin to support an extension. The West Virginia senator drove a stake through Democrats' spending hopes on Sunday, announcing on Fox News he won't vote for the Build Back Better plan as it currently stands. Part of the proposal included an extension of the child tax credit, which has doled out monthly payments as large as $300 to roughly 36 million households since it began in July. The last checks for the program went out on December 15, and it was up for renewal in President Biden's BBB plan. Manchin publicly criticized BBB's price tag for months, arguing it posed too great a risk with inflation already running at historic highs. Yet a Monday interview with West Virginia's MetroNews revealed more reasons for Manchin's opposition and, specifically, why he wouldn't back a re-up of the child tax credit. The centrist senator began by repeating his call for a work requirement, arguing such a test is necessary for the payments to be ""accountable."" Other Senate Democrats had rebuked the work requirement in recent months, with many arguing that raising a child is work in itself. The Monday interview signals that, unless such a stipulation is added, Manchin will allow the credit to expire in late December. Manchin also raised issue with the credit's income thresholds. There's no test to ensure the credit reaches the families who need it most, and that's led the program to be more expensive than necessary, the senator told MetroNews host Hoppy Kercheval. ""Do you believe people making $200,000 and $400,000 should still get the child tax credit the same as someone making $50,000, $60,000, or $70,000 that really needs it?"" Manchin said. The $200,000 and $400,000 levels reference the thresholds at which the child tax credit phases out faster for individual or joint tax filers. Households making more than those levels each year already aren't able to receive the full credit. A separate report published earlier Monday morning revealed some of the qualms Manchin had privately raised with the child tax credit. Manchin told Democratic colleagues in recent months he was concerned parents would waste the payments on drugs, The Huffington Post reported, citing sources familiar with the senator's comments. Though Manchin didn't address such concerns in the MetroNews interview, he noted that the program should be more targeted. Congress should ""make sure the money follows a child"" so it can go to another caretaker if the biological parents aren't raising the child, the senator said. There are ""so many things we can fix that [Democrats] won't even talk about,"" Manchin said, adding ""we've been way far apart philosophically."" The fallout from an expired child tax credit would likely be harsh. The program's first payments alone led the child poverty rate to drop to 11.9% from 15.8% through June, according to researchers at Columbia University's Center on Poverty and Social Policy. Almost 10 million children risk falling back into poverty if the credit isn't renewed, researchers at the progressive Center for Budget and Policy Priorities said earlier in December. The credit's expiration would also come months before the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, leaving families with higher borrowing costs while direct aid dries up. Other Democrats aren't giving up yet on passing BBB and extending the credit. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer vowed to ""keep fighting"" for the spending plan on Monday, noting in a letter to colleagues that Manchin's opposition wouldn't deter the party ""from continuing to find a way forward."" How the party moves forward, however, is unclear. Manchin's remarks all but guarantee that, if the child tax credit is extended at all, it won't be nearly as wide-reaching as it's been this year.

12/21/2021,"Prince Charles’s wife, Camilla Parker Bowles, is taking on an all-new role just in time for 2022. The Duchess of Cornwall, 74, was just named Patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), which aims to connect military personnel with their families. She announced the exciting news by sitting down for a candid video, which was shared by the royals on YouTube and social media. In the video, Bowles reveals that it’s an honor to act as Patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service. “I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak to you all for the first time as a very proud Patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service,” she says. “For 75 years, the BFBS has championed our wonderful Armed Forces and shone a spotlight on their vital work.” She continues, “Spanning 15 time zones, from the deserts of the Middle East to the windswept Falkland Islands, you are a truly worldwide organization that supports our service men and women wherever they may find themselves. You also, of course, support service families who face immense obstacles.” Bowles went on to explain why she’s so passionate about the Armed Forces, adding, “I know a little of the importance of maintaining the connection between service personnel and family because during the second World War, my father was held as a prisoner of war in Germany.” She says, “The men could cope with almost anything as long as they were not deprived of some form of contact with home.” This new partnership sounds right up her alley.

12/21/2021,"By Tom Balmforth MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday it urgently needed a response from the United States on its sweeping security demands and again warned of a possible Russian military response unless it saw political action to assuage its concerns. Moscow, which has unnerved the West with a troop buildup near Ukraine, last week unveiled a wish list of security proposals it wants to negotiate, including a promise NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine. Washington has said some of Russia's proposals are obviously unacceptable, but that the United States will respond some time this week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks. Konstantin Gavrilov, a Russian diplomat in Vienna, said that relations between Moscow and NATO had reached a ""moment of truth"". ""The conversation needs to be serious and everyone in NATO understands perfectly well despite their strength and power that concrete political action needs to be taken, otherwise the alternative is a military-technical and military response from Russia,"" he was quoted as saying by RIA news agency. The U.S. response is likely to shape Moscow's calculus over Ukraine, which has become the main flashpoint in East-West relations. The United States and Ukraine say Russia may be preparing an invasion of its ex-Soviet neighbour. Russia denies that and says it is Ukraine's growing relationship with NATO that has caused the standoff to escalate. It has compared it to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world came to the brink of nuclear war. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that Moscow had so far received no response from the United States. ""I think they'll try to turn this into a slow-moving process, but we need it to be urgent, because the situation is very difficult, it is acute, it tends to become more complicated,"" he was quoted by RIA as saying. The Kremlin said it was still too early to assess the West's response, but that information from ""various sources"" about a readiness to discuss the ideas was positive. Asked separately about a Belarusian proposal to host Russian nuclear weapons in the event of similar deployments in its vicinity by the West, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had numerous options. ""It's no secret the deployment of different types of armaments near our borders that could pose a danger would require corresponding steps to be taken to balance the situation. There are all sorts of options here,"" he said.

12/21/2021,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene rejected claims the pro-Trump movement is racist at a conference.  She tried to defend it by noting that ""yellow people"" are among those who love Trump. Critics pointed out that the phrase has a long history as a racist slur.  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia attracted criticism for using a term widely seen as a racial slur in boasting of the racial diversity those who support former President Donald Trump.  Greene, an outspoken Republican champion of Trump, made the comments at the weekend conference of the conservative Turning Point USA youth movement.  ""When I walked in yesterday, I was like, what kind of people come here?"" Greene said. ""So I'm walking around and seeing some good people, and I see white people, Black people, brown people, yellow people."" —PatriotTakes 🇺🇸 (@patriottakes) December 19, 2021 ""And then there's talk of freedom and loving America and conservative principles, some crazy people in here were talking about how much they love this guy named Jesus. And I heard — someone I really like — I think I heard that a lot of people here like a guy named Donald J. Trump."" She went on to mock those who accuse the pro-Trump movement of being racist. ""And then I said, 'Oh, oh, I know exactly what this is: the left calls this a white supremacist party."" Greene's use of the phrase ""yellow people"" is itself a racist trope, critics pointed out.  ""I honestly haven't heard someone use ""yellow people"" for decades,"" said George Takei, the famed ""Star Trek"" actor who has campaigned against discrimination towards Asian Americans.  ""Referring to Asian Americans as 'yellow people' definitely isn't something a white supremacy cult would do,"" tweeted activist Nathan Schneider. Insider contacted Greene's office for comment on the criticism.  In the late 19th and early 20th century, the term ""yellow peril"" was widely used to stir racist fears of malign Asian influence, and a series of discriminatory anti-Asian laws were passed.  Greene has built her political reputation by participating in culture-war controversies, and has previously drawn accusations of racism.
