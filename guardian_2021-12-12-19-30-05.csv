12/12/2021,"Priti Patel’s much-trumpeted scheme to allow Afghans to resettle in Britain has been starved of “appropriate resources”, according to officials, as a former senior diplomat voices fears that the UK government appears intent to let the initiative wither away before it has even started. The Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme (ACRS) was announced to great fanfare in August as the Taliban took Kabul, but four months on it has still not started. A senior Whitehall source with intimate knowledge of the scheme said it had been delayed because it had not received adequate support for it to launch.  Adam Thomson, a former Foreign Office director for Afghanistan, said that, based on his experience, it appeared evident that the scheme to resettle vulnerable Afghans had been a cynical show of political opportunism that was now destined to fail. “It looks like a politically expedient announcement. With the media focus having gone elsewhere, the government has lost political will, lost focus and lost implementation. “It’s a tried and tested technique. You announce something, you look good. Then somehow circumstances prevent you from actually achieving your targets,” said Thomson, who is also a former UK ambassador to Pakistan and Nato”. Since the announcement of the resettlement scheme on 18 August more than 100 days have passed with no apparent tangible progress. Its website has not been updated since 13 September and confirms the programme “is not yet open”. Last week, however, the government issued a statement saying it was committed to the initiative and that the ACRS was “one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history”. Without offering a timeframe, it promised “more details soon” on a scheme which was promoted by ministers as a programme to help women, children and religious minorities at risk of Taliban reprisals. Similar disquiet also surrounds the resources and effectiveness of another government relocation scheme involving Afghanistan – the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap). On Friday, a parliamentary answer revealed that just 84 officials have been assigned to Arap, which was launched in April and conceived to resettle people who worked for the UK in Afghanistan. The same parliamentary response confirmed it had so far received more than 90,000 applications, with more arriving each day – a caseload that suggests each official is dealing with or has processed more than 1,000 applications. When the Home Office was asked how many officials had been assigned to the resettlement scheme, it would not provide a figure. Similarly, no indication of resources relating to the scheme has been provided, although a Whitehall source said if they had wanted to get the scheme up and running quickly they could have recruited volunteers from the civil service. The Whitehall source, who has knowledge of the ACRS, said: “The resettlement scheme was a ticket for people to rebuild their life but it’s just not been resourced appropriately.” Thomson added: “As far as I can tell there’s no cross-Whitehall coordination mechanism that brings together FCDO [the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office], the Home Office and the MoD to actually make sense of Arap and launch ACRS.” A spokesperson for Adam Smith International (ASI), which delivered UK government aid programmes in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2018, said the failure to open the resettlement scheme had compounded eligibility issues with regard to Arap and had left hundreds in grave danger. “Almost none of our former staff have had any update or information about their applications since the evacuation finished. The ACRS scheme is not yet open. This has left hundreds of our staff from UK projects in a desperate situation in Kabul, without hope and without information,” they said. Only about 20 of ASI’s former staff out of more than 230 who applied for resettlement via the Arap scheme have so far been given the chance to relocate to the UK. The government said: “ACRS is one of the most generous schemes in our country’s history and will give up to 20,000 further people at risk a new life in the UK. We are working across government and with partners such as UNHCR [the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees] to design and open the scheme amidst a complex and changing picture. We are committed to working in step with the international community to get this right.”",News/World news,Fears grow that Home Office has lost will to resettle Afghans under threat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/fears-grow-that-home-office-has-lost-will-to-resettle-afghans-under-threat
12/12/2021,"Drug addicts should be allowed to use illicit substances in “supervised injecting facilities” with medical staff on hand to ensure no one dies, health groups are urging ministers. Senior doctors, public health specialists, drug experts and health charities want the government to approve trials of “overdose prevention centres” (OPCs) to cut Britain’s soaring toll of drug deaths. Supporters of the idea say that while letting users consume hard drugs in safe places, watched over by nurses and doctors, is controversial, it reduces fatalities and drug-related crime.  Scores of organisations and individuals working in the health and drug fields have signed a statement co-ordinated by the Faculty of Public Health (FPH) calling on ministers to permit the creation of some centres in order to save lives. Drug-related deaths hit a new record of 5,900 in Britain last year. There were 4,561 in England and Wales. Almost half of such poisonings involved opiates, including heroin, and 777 deaths involved cocaine. “Urgent action is needed to tackle the spiralling rates of drug deaths across the UK. Drug deaths are avoidable and it is unacceptable that we see evidence-based actions to prevent harm such as OPCs go unutilised in the UK,” the statement says. “OPCs are healthcare facilities where individuals consume their own drugs supervised by trained staff who can intervene if they overdose.” Signatories include the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the Association of Directors of Public Health, charities such as the Hepatitis C Trust and National Aids Trust, and the drug reform campaign group Transform. Professor Maggie Rae, the president of the FPH, said the 6,000 deaths “are lives we can save”, adding: “As health and care professionals, we are guided by the imperative of protecting health and saving lives, and nothing else. Government has a moral duty to take all steps possible to protect health; and to ignore this call and the clear evidence in support of OPCs as a life-saving measure is to accept the continued loss of thousands of lives across the UK.” Drug consumption rooms have been used in many European countries since the emergence of Aids in the 1980s as a way of reducing diseases associated with drug use. The Netherlands has a network of several dozen, Germany has more than 20 and there are others in Spain, Denmark and Switzerland. At most centres, staff give addicts needles to reduce infection risk, offer counselling, encourage users to seek treatment and step in if someone overdoses. The all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform, a cross-party group of MPs and peers, has also backed the statement. Its chair, the Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, said: “The international evidence is overwhelming that public health and public safety are advanced by the existence of these overdose prevention centres. “There’s a significant reduction in the number of drug deaths, more people become engaged with drug treatment, crime falls, drug problems in an area become less visible – for example, there are fewer needles lying around – and the lives of users and people who live and work in areas that were previously plagued with the consequences of drug abuse are significantly improved.” However, the government made clear it would not permit even a trial of the facilities. “We have no plans to introduce drug consumption rooms and anyone running them would be committing a range of offences, including possession of a controlled drug,” a spokesperson said. They pointed to the 10-year drugs strategy launched last week, which includes a commitment to put £780m into improving access to treatment. Last year, drug worker Peter Krykant established the first drug consumption facility in an ambulance in Glasgow. However, he lost his job and was cautioned by the police as a result of setting up the service. The experience, together with trying to help other traumatised drug users sent him back into drug-taking after 11 years. He has since recovered and remains determined to help addicts, but says “it was easier to get support 20 years ago in Scotland than it is now”.",News/Politics,"Overdose prevention centres will save lives, say UK senior doctors",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/overdose-prevention-centres-will-save-lives-say-uk-senior-doctors
12/12/2021,"After years of stability, the Office for National Statistics reported that alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 had increased by 19% from 2019, counting 8,974 deaths coded as caused by alcohol misuse, with three in four being from alcoholic liver disease. The national lockdown saw an increase in abstention, but also in heavy drinking. Harm can increase without greater total consumption: the distribution matters, not just the average. Drinking too much alcohol raises the risks of many diseases, so analysts try to estimate total numbers of deaths attributable to alcohol consumption – they modelled about 19,200 alcohol-related deaths in England in 2019, around four times the direct count of number of alcohol-specific registrations. The method requires many assumptions, such as 11% of breast cancer deaths in women over 75 being due to alcohol, and a major recent change in such attributable fractions cut estimated alcohol-related death figures by around 23%.  People might like a single number to settle an issue but we cannot count everything directly and analysts may need to construct a range of statistics to improve our understanding. Many tens of thousands of deaths every year are attributed to air pollution, but until an inquest in 2020, it was never given as an official cause of an individual death. Influenza also demonstrates the limitations of counting. Between 2013 and 2020, only around 600 people in England and Wales died with influenza as the direct underlying cause each year. Yet England’s public health agency estimated in 2020 that there were around 15,000 “influenza-attributable deaths” in the 2016-17 season alone. That figure comes from the FluMomo model, which picks out periods with high mortality over a curved seasonal baseline, attributing those deaths to influenza or extreme temperatures. This approach has some weaknesses, including potential overestimation and insufficient corrections for registration delays. In essence, FluMomo tries to estimate how many fewer deaths would occur if flu were eliminated. That just about happened last winter, contributing to a deficit in non-Covid-19 deaths and our continued distancing behaviour means, once again, flu is running at a very low level. That’s currently about the one bit of good news for the NHS.  David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge. Anthony Masters is statistical ambassador for the Royal Statistical Society",News/From the Observer,"Deaths attributable to alcohol, air pollution and flu must be modelled rather than counted | David Spieghalter and Anthony Masters",https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2021/dec/12/deaths-attributable-to-alcohol-air-pollution-and-flu-must-be-modelled-rather-than-counted
12/12/2021,"Before I started out in forensics 20 years ago, I served in the military. I was a communications engineer in the army, radios were my domain. After I left, someone suggested I turn to digital forensics. I was a bit of a sceptic at first, but I just didn’t understand what could be done. In my time, I’ve worked in both the private and public sector; within the police and as an independent expert.  Nearly everything I do starts with a device – a phone or computer. When prosecuting or defending, I’ll be handed the device usually seized by police officers, or all its data once it has been extracted. I want anything and everything I can get my teeth into, seeking information and clues. I’m looking at all sorts, from the content of messages to locations and metadata. Information comes from Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp… There are call logs and SMS messages, emails, geotags and pictures, too. It’s rare, these days, for any case to not to have digital evidence in play, from terrorism and violent crime, to missing persons and school bullying. It’s no great surprise that data which might be useful can end up deleted. My job is to identify what’s hidden, sometimes starting with backups, whether on the device or online (when it’s legal and authorities have the right to do so). Information is also stored after it’s been removed by a user. There’ll be communication and system logs; thumbnails of images often remain in a database long after the original has been put in the bin. Phones just used to do texts and calls. It’s unrecognisable, really, compared to what they do now. The tools we have at our disposal are good, but we’re constantly playing catchup with the criminal world. The trouble is, even the most basic technology can be used by criminals to their advantage, making my job harder. Much of the information I can glean from mobile devices comes from traces of communication pinging around different corners of the internet. Global criminal networks can avoid this in a very simple way, for instance, by logging into an email account online, writing a message and leaving it in the drafts folder. Someone else can then sign in, read and respond without leaving a trace. That just means I have to work even harder, with data spread across different jurisdictions. I’m certainly careful about how I use my phone and apps, knowing what I do, but I reckon that’s generational. I turned 60 last month, I didn’t grow up sharing my life online. In my line of work, it would seem strange to start. I sit at the interface between forensics and archaeology. I’m an environmental archaeologist who uses minuscule materials found in the natural world as clues, whether to try and solve crimes, or to imagine what landscapes looked like thousands of years ago. Microfossils are my specialism: preserved elements invisible to the naked eye. Specifically, I turn to diatoms – microscopic, single cell algae that grow in wet conditions, from soils to the ocean. Examining them closely at crime scenes and on evidence can help paint a picture, linking both people and objects to places and times. A case often starts with soil: what is it like? Does it have unique properties? Which diatoms are living inside it? There’ll be huge variations, from Scottish highland mulch to urban grit. Once that’s analysed, I look at possible transference – can these diatoms be traced on the suspect’s clothing, personal possessions or a getaway car? There’s endless information hiding in the humble shoe. Usually, these techniques are used to try and solve violent crimes. But I’m also increasingly working on heritage crime, alongside Historic England. People engaging in their own illegal excavations of important archeological sites is a real problem. With little enforcement, much of our history can disappear into thin air. That’s where forensic ecology can help. Take my case from last year involving Beeston Castle, a protected heritage site in Cheshire. In December 2019, five men illegally metal detected in its grounds, taking off with axe heads and other bronze age artefacts. After attempts were made to sell the items, the police got involved. As so often happens, the suspects simply claimed they’d found the haul elsewhere. So, I took soil samples from the castle, and created a profile. Within the axe heads, I found a direct diatom match. Securing convictions from this type of crime is traditionally incredibly hard, but using our techniques, the men were found guilty. My field is still a fairly unknown corner of forensics. Taking evidence to court in a way both judge and jury can understand is often difficult. Generally, people understand the basics of DNA and fingerprints from books, or shows on Netflix. Diatoms? Understandably very few people have a clue. Still, recently, a forensic ecologist has been written into Silent Witness. I’m told she’s based on me. I studied zoology and always thought I’d end up working with big, cute and furry animals. Somehow, I ended up dedicating my career to the study of fleas and flies. I knew I would the first time I looked at insects through a microscope. Most of us never see them in fine detail, but up close you see how beautiful and fascinating they really are. My PhD was on the decomposition of flesh and what the succession of insects that appear on bodies might tell us. I spent time in Tennessee at the Anthropological Research Facility, otherwise known as the Body Farm. Before I’d even finished writing up my research, I was being called out to do casework. Today, I’m also a lecturer in forensic investigation, too. Blow flies are my focus in forensic work, the little creatures most of us only ever spend time swatting. But in my line of work, they can offer many answers. After death, blow flies are often the first to arrive. The female will lay eggs which hatch into tiny larvae. Then other insects will appear. Deciphering each of these stages can tell us the minimum amount of time since someone died. In the first few days, I can estimate a time of death to within a few hours; I can help rule out whole periods when the death couldn’t have occurred. This helps detectives focus their investigations, calling on all sorts of evidence relevant to that specific time. That’s quite a lot to learn from the humble fly. I chose this path because it seemed interesting. If somebody had told me this would be my career when I was a child, or even 10 years ago, I wouldn’t have believed them. I’m not motivated by putting people behind bars; I just want to find the truth. Yes, my evidence can result in convictions, but what I find may well also indicate innocence as well. Whoever I appear for, I remain totally neutral. I can’t try to support a single theory. I’ll write my analysis, write up a report, and see what’s found. Sometimes I do get affected by what I see. Driving home from a scene, I turn up the radio very loud in the car – the music blasts out, air hits my face with the windows open. It helps me feel alive. In forensic linguistics, there’s a tenet we use to describe our work: improving the delivery of justice through language. We’ll look at any criminal or legal context where language is an issue. That means highlighting language barriers in the justice system. It also means catching the bad guys. Authorship analysis is a core part of our work: we try to ascertain who might have written a particular piece of text. A forensic linguist will read the relevant evidence and compare it with known writings of potential suspects. Our job is to ascertain who is most likely to have been responsible for writing it. There are all sorts of characteristics we look for – a basket of potentially useful features. It could be odd spellings, repeatedly used phrases, grammatical constructions. I might tend to say “hi”; where you’d say “hello”. There was an offender on the dark web who was partially identified because he regularly used the unusual greeting “hiyas”. The same goes for all uses of language. A decision, often subconscious, is made with everything we write or say – we call the habitual ones “idiolectal choices”. I’m looking to find the patterns these habits can create, in the hope of identifying authorship. We also do profiling, trying to describe the type of person who might have written something based on these decisions. There are gendered and socio-economic markers, professional and regional ones, too. We look to colloquialisms and influences from other languages. When attempts at extortion are being made – with ransom notes – this can be hugely valuable intelligence. Slang interpretation is becoming an increasingly common area for us, drawing up dictionaries to help juries interpret the meaning of messages later presented as evidence. This can prove integral in proving whether there was intent, or conspiracy to commit a criminal activity. Forensic linguistics has been around in its current form since the 1970s, but it’s the internet presents a whole new arena for us, with potentially vast applications. Anonymity is a real challenge to law enforcement online – you can conceal your face, location, voice… and yet it’s impossible to conceal your language. We also train law enforcement officers who might need to go undercover online, ensuring they’re equipped with the relevant language to sound plausible. This might allow them to infiltrate digital criminal gangs by knowing the relevant lexicon, in turn catching abusers. At times, an officer might also need to jump on to a victim’s device urgently to catch an offender. Helping them communicate believably is key in these “account takeover scenarios”. Of course, criminals have and will catch on. Gloves can be worn to hide fingerprints – no doubt similar attempts will be made online to cover up identifying features of language. It’s no small task and these efforts at subterfuge could well create their own distinctive patterns for us to identify and analyse. It’s all part of the job. Forensic linguistics became a storyline in the final series of Line of Duty. A certain word was repeatedly misspelt, and this offered clues. The exposure was great, but it riled us linguists a little. Officers claimed there was a 95% probability certain messages had been sent by a specific suspect. In real life, we would never claim to be quite so certain. For the most part, I’m a generalist forensic scientist. For much of my career, I’ve taken the crime scene to courtroom approach. That’s a necessity when you work in an NYPD crime lab. You’ve got to use all the traces at your disposal, from fingerprints to the analysis of gunshot residue. I wanted more from my work, so I went back to school to get my doctorate. I left the police, but continued to work through my studies as a medical photographer, and investigator, too. For a while, I even considered a career change into art conservation. I needed to find my own area to explore. While working a job investigating death scenes, there was a case which changed the course of my career. A woman’s body had been found in a park – the only way we could identify her was by a tattoo: a rose, with the name Patricia underneath. Officers used this evidence to help identify the victim. And, sure enough, they secured a conviction for the man who killed her, too. Few people had really considered tattoos in forensics before I started my research properly: not just in using them as a means for identification, but in other ways as well. I’m interested in everything from the chemical makeup of inks, to what can be drawn out from a tattoo’s imagery. The field is very much in its infancy, I’m still assessing the significance of what can be done. Looking at inks themselves is of particular interest to me. If a body is unidentifiable, but a tattoo can be detected, could the ink tell us where or when the body art was done? We have specialist techniques to look at tattoos that have become damaged, infrared photography in particular. The biggest problem I face is that people in the field, from law enforcement to pathologists, don’t even know I exist. Considering tattoos may not even cross their mind. I’d love to see a day where tattoos are considered a key part of investigations. And, obviously, I’d quite like to be that person called to the scene. My interest in botany predates my living memory. Mum says I’d sit and stare at vegetation as soon as I was old enough to crawl. Alongside people, plants have always been my favourite thing on the planet. I don’t know where it came from, but I was reading degree level textbooks on botany by the age of 10. After completing my PhD, I worked as a habitat surveyor, traipsing around London’s backstreets recording biodiversity and wild plants. Soon, I became a curator at the Natural History Museum. Then one day, out of the blue, I received a phone call: “We’ve got a dead body in a ditch, can you give us a hand?” I jumped on the train, and dived in at the deep end. Sensorially, you just learn on the job. You can’t know if you’ll be able to emotionally and physiologically deal with the experience until you get there. As it happens, I found I could. I help police search for bodies in the natural landscape when there’s a missing person. Often these are cold cases, when someone may have been in situ for years and years. I’m looking for tells in the natural environment of where a body might be. I also get called in once a body is discovered, often helping identify how long the person’s remains may have been there for. The plant life might hold clues as to whether there was a struggle; could someone have made an escape? How the vegetation has grown around the body is full of clues. I also look for trace evidence – fragments of natural materials that could link a suspect to a crime scene or victim. If there’s a body, for instance, I’d make an inventory of all the plants in the area. Later, if we have a suspect or items of evidence, I’ll examine the plant life that might link the two. Botanists often talk about “plant blindness” – how people don’t see vegetation as having a story to tell, but just as lumps of green. I, meanwhile, can look at two identical seeming bushes and draw out distinct details. One might be decades old, another grown rapidly from seed. I can tell if it’s been left to grow, pruned or hacked away at. Observations like these can prove very important. When you’re called into a serious crime scene, you work until you drop. It’s not just the mental efforts that tire me out, but crawling through the mud while it pours with rain. I’m in my mid-50s now; my knees can really hurt. On my last case, I worked 70 hours in six days. When I got home I could barely speak or move. How do I relax? With a glass of wine and an entirely unbelievable zombie film.

12/12/2021,"Another day. Another body under Boris Johnson’s battlebus. Another Tory adviser on the white steps of another Canonbury villa. Another pantomime of regret fabricated from whatever tortured sounds and sad shapes the face can muster. Another bright satellite burning up in Johnson’s doomed orbit. Intended to absorb difficult questions, Allegra Stratton was a five-and-a-half foot human loofah made of chlorinated chicken, 30% full of liquefied facts. Her press secretary role was created in 2020, a firewall between Boris Johnson and the troublesome world of events. This week, for example, she might have shielded him from the unproven suggestion that he had helped to fly 170 asylum-seeking pets out from collapsing Kabul, like the animal-loving politician played by Steve Coogan in the forthcoming Disney+ film Taliban Dolittle.  Stratton was even given her own Downing Street press conference hub in which to answer hacks’ pesky queries, at a cost to the taxpayer of £2.6m, a strategy assumed to be more effective than merely hiding the prime minister in a nearby fridge at the first sign of a microphone, a notebook and some semblance of journalistic ability. Bizarrely, the only time the £2.6m speak-space made any impression was this week, a year after its completion, when footage emerged of Stratton on its podium, rehearsing plausible denials of a Covid rule-breaking party in Downing Street last December, and finding the whole thing a wizard wheeze. “Is cheese and wine all right? This is recorded,” she laughs. “This fictional party was a business meeting and it wasn’t socially distanced.” Watching Stratton flail, it’s obvious why her press secretary role was so swiftly canned. Had she been given the job she would have made things even worse. As it happens, she didn’t get the job, and made things even worse anyway, a special kind of genius. Under lockdown, I admit, I went to a party. Or did I? Suddenly I am not so sure. Was it a party after all, or just some people in a place? There was cheese and wine, I think. Does that make it a party? There is cheese in a cheese sandwich and wine in a wine bottle, but that doesn’t mean either is a party. Or does it? Maybe I attended a cheese sandwich? Or climbed into a wine bottle, like a tiny Spanish galleon? Or maybe I went to a business meeting? I met people, certainly, but did I do any business? If there are no people in a room, but there is cheese, does that mean it is a party? Whether it was a party, not a party, a business meeting, a cheese sandwich, or a wine bottle, one thing I am certain of is that the correct procedures were observed. And a man who may have been at the party, or wasn’t if it wasn’t a party after all, will soon be contracted to confirm that. By me. Last month, vaccination checks were at the discretion of venues, and it seemed unlikely that the government would insist on face coverings in theatres. After all, Boris Johnson likes to watch Macbeth mask-free while masked people all around him wonder what he takes away from the tale of an ambitious traitor and his manipulative wife. But by Wednesday night, a massive dead cat was required to distract from a day of denied parties and prioritised pets, so Johnson banged plan B on the kitchen table, alienating backbench Covid sceptics. Given the irrefutable evidence of Boris Johnson’s government’s corruption and callousness, how can those few Tory MPs that appear to have a conscience, such as the new intake that voted against their leader’s attempt to spare Owen Paterson, remain in the disgusting party? They should retire from politics, or join the Liberal Democrats, which is essentially the same thing. Even given everything that has happened this week, there are many diehard Tories, clinging to an inflatable bendy banana marked “Get Brexit Done”, who will still want to vote for the party despite its utter rottenness. After all what’s the alternative? A blandly competent Labour party notably not hell-bent on asset-stripping the country’s infrastructure to line their own pockets? That simply won’t do! But the Tory faithful will require a blood sacrifice to convince them their concerns are being addressed. And maybe this time some doorstep weeping and a symbolic sacking of soon-to-be-forgotten Foreign Office Sirs will not be enough. Fate has handed us the perfect votive offering to assuage Tory anger: Pen Farthing’s Afghan animals. Farthing’s innocent 170 refugee dogs and evacu-cats are now permanently branded by association with Tory negligence and Boris Johnson’s lies, even though the intervention by Johnson’s own personal parliamentary private secretary on the poor beasts’ behalf isn’t definitive evidence of his guilt. But on the corner of Hyde Park, where once stood the bloody tree of Tyburn, let us pile a pyre of faggots. Let banks of seating be laid upon the lush slopes of the magnificent Marble Arch Mound. Newly relieved of her latest government role, Allegra Stratton serves party cheese and party wine as Boris Johnson, and other chief actors in the cavalcade of contempt for the lonely Covid dead of lockdown, take their seats, to watch through their onion tears. Then the lie-stained animals are burned en masse, all 170 of them, on a bonfire lit with flamboyant regret by a vindicated Ant and Dec. And let the smoke from the smouldering bodies be visible, yea, even from the hills of Gog Magog, and serve as a ritual purification of Conservative-soiled Albion, in this valley of dying stars, in this hollow valley, this broken jaw of our lost kingdom.

12/12/2021,"Imet Sean at a gig where we were both performing in the late 80s and we immediately hit it off. We shared a similar sense of humour, and also a sense of outsider status which gave us an added spur to succeed but with a determination to have fun while doing it. The fact that we were able to make people laugh, and make a living from it, felt like we were on a wild adventure that we didn’t want to end. Sean’s early gigs in clubs where he was learning the craft were often rowdy affairs where he honed his skill at dealing with the odd drunk heckler, which developed over the years into an effortless ability to riff on whatever subject came up.  In 1993 we took a show to the Edinburgh fringe, which featured a sketch where I hid as “a pie” in a dessert trolley – my head poking through a hole in some plywood, garnished with lettuce – which Sean pushed on to the stage, offering the audience a slice of “pie… fresh off the head”. Filming with Harry Hill, we took the whole caboodle out on to the streets of Edinburgh, where we fell foul of a pub landlady who thought we were trying to sell pie outside her pub. The following year we wrote a show called Rock, where Sean played a faithful roadie to my old rocker character trying to make a comeback. We had a custom smoked-glass stretch shopping trolley made (our shows always seemed to feature trolleys), in which Sean wheeled my character around. The show ended up touring around the country, culminating with a slot on the comedy stage at the Glastonbury festival. Sean would bemoan the fact that he didn’t play an instrument, but for that particular performance he threw himself into learning the bongos. For the same show, we wrote a prog-rock pastiche, The Leg of Time, during which Sean danced around me holding a fake leg with a clock gaffer-taped to it – production levels were quite basic in those days. For all the low-budget larkiness, there was a lot of good writing in Rock and it garnered some favourable reviews, which I think Sean really appreciated. His talent for comic writing really hit its stride in Fifteen Minutes of Misery, a series of shows he wrote and starred in for BBC Radio 4. Its success led to the making of 15 Storeys High, a sitcom he wrote for BBC TV. Sean played a downbeat swimming pool attendant, Vince, who lived in a tower block and was convinced his neighbours were up to all sorts of strange behaviour. It was brilliantly, darkly funny and gave full rein to Sean’s finely tuned ear for absurd dialogue, for his comic invention and well-wrought scripts. During the 90s Sean’s comedy career went from strength to strength, culminating in him winning best live comic at the British Comedy Awards in 2000. We both put in a lot of miles getting to gigs during this time, our friendship forged over many late-night stops in motorway service stations. Sean had that rare knack of truly great comics to be able to take audiences with him on ever more tortuous and often quite dark routes, yet such was the warmth of his personality and easy manner that crowds happily followed along, and his reputation grew. When he took on the job of team captain on 8 Out of 10 Cats for Channel 4, it brought his comedy to a huge audience, and led to him being loved by millions. Sean was a superb writer of comedy, a clever and rigorous practitioner of the art, who saw it as something to be crafted, to be treated almost like poetry. His standup sets were delirious, dizzying journeys down endless rabbit holes, that left you helpless with laughter. Away from the world of TV and entertainment, he was a dedicated and loving family man. He was a great host, an excellent cook, and was never happier than pottering around in the kitchen preparing a fish stew, while dancing to dub reggae. He was a great organiser of events and people generally; family holidays with Sean were always well planned, and always involved his love of good food and a decent bottle of wine. He was as funny off stage as on. I will remember a kind, generous and loyal friend who I loved dearly, and feel a great sadness at his loss. He leaves a wife, Anoushka, and their three children, his sister Kate and his brothers Paul and Pete. And he leaves us all a wonderful comic legacy and – for me and those lucky enough to have known him – some cherished memories and unforgettable nights of laughter.",Arts/Stage,Those we lost in 2021: Sean Lock remembered by Bill Bailey,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/12/obituaries-2021-sean-lock-remembered-by-bill-bailey
12/12/2021,"’Tis the season to be jolly, and last week Marieke Navin and her boyfriend were planning to attend three Christmas parties between them. But now, following the rise of the Omicron variant, they are not going to any. “I was looking forward to those parties,” said Navin. “But my priority is protecting Christmas. I don’t want my children to be isolating in their room on Christmas Day, or be unable to visit their dad or my parents. I don’t want my partner’s kids to be unable to come to us on Boxing Day. I don’t want to jeopardise the movement of the children, and I don’t want anyone being poorly over Christmas.”  She is among the many thousands of people around the country who are reluctantly changing their plans to “save” Christmas from Covid. Last Wednesday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, warned that the Omicron variant of the virus was “spreading very fast” and “rapidly progressing”. Over the past 18 days, since the virus was first reported to the World Health Organization on 24 November, nearly a fifth of the Christmas events booked through the digital events platform HeadBox have been cancelled, with more than half the cancellations occurring in the past week. A further 22% of event organisers have postponed their Christmas parties until the new year, a HeadBox spokesperson said. “There is a desire to protect employees, family and friends in the run-up to Christmas, particularly as so many missed out last year,” she added. Navin, a festival organiser based in Manchester, said her employer did a poll last week and discovered only 10 of her 35 colleagues wanted to attend the work Christmas party this year. “Personally, I didn’t feel comfortable. I would have had to travel there by train and, even though masks are mandatory on public transport again, I estimate only about 40% of people are wearing them.” She is relieved that, following the government’s announcement of new “Plan B” restrictions, she will be able to work from home until Christmas Day – and she is now planning to do all her Christmas shopping online. “I’m trying to ringfence Christmas for my family.” But at the same time, she is unhappy to be spending another December cooped up inside: “It’s another year of not celebrating with friends and family the way you want to. I feel tired that we’re still here – and angry. I think we’ve been let down by the government.” Hearing about the Christmas party at No 10 last year has been infuriating: “It’s disgusting. It makes a mockery of everything that we’re sacrificing, and have sacrificed.” Over in the Hertfordshire town of Ware, French teacher Cathie Little is also feeling heartbroken about her Christmas plans. She and her family were looking forward to spending Christmas Day in her homeland of France with her mother, who lives alone. But following the rapid spread of Omicron around the world, she has cancelled their flights and all their plans. “If we came into contact with someone who tested positive on the flight home, we would have had to isolate – and we couldn’t take that chance.” Being forced to isolate would “ruin” the Christmas holidays for her five-year-old son, she said. “He wouldn’t be able to see his paternal grandparents, which, for him, would be the end of the world. He’s very attached to them, and not being able to see them at Christmas last year was a huge deal for him. It made him very anxious.” Meanwhile, she hasn’t seen her own mother for two years. “She’s going to be alone on Christmas Day, and that makes me feel so sad. I miss France like crazy, and my friends. But this is what we’ve had to do, to protect my son’s Christmas.” Instead of celebrating together in France, she and her mother will Skype on Christmas Day and the family will eat a specially made Christmas log from a local French patisserie. “But it won’t be the same.” In Crouch End, north London, Jessica Bailey has also been cancelling her social plans. She is no longer going to attend her pregnant best friend’s “gender reveal”/Christmas party next Sunday. “That was really tough, because we’re close.” She has also decided not to invite any of her son’s friends over to celebrate his fourth birthday with him next week. “It’s just such a risky time, 10 days before Christmas. I don’t want to put other parents in that awkward situation of having to say no to their child mingling with mine.” Her son has been hospitalised twice this month with RSV, a respiratory illness that children appear to be more susceptible to than usual this year: “It’s been really scary,” she says. She is planning to spend Christmas with her 69-year-old mother and a family friend, who is vulnerable to Covid. “For the sake of our Christmas and, more specifically, just for the sake of our own health, I can’t take the risk of me or my son getting Covid right now. I can’t put us through anything else.”",News/World news,‘My son’s birthday party is off’ – the sacrifices UK parents are making to save Christmas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/12/my-sons-birthday-party-is-off-the-sacrifices-uk-parents-are-making-to-save-christmas
12/12/2021,"Mothers and babies are being put at risk as vital health checks and support services remain shut months after lockdown was lifted, health professionals and charities have warned.  Face-to-face services for new families stopped when lockdown began in March last year and have not come back in many parts of the country. Now experts fear the spread of the Omicron variant and the reintroduction of some restrictions means the reopening will be delayed further. Missing services include drop-in baby-weighing clinics, tongue-tie clinics, face-to-face breastfeeding support and council-run baby classes and playgroups. Experts have accused the government of failing to prioritise the needs of a generation of babies and their parents, with cost-cutting and a shortage of midwives and health visitors blamed for the closures. Parents told the Observer they have been unable to access in-person support in parts of London, Essex, Sussex, Yorkshire, Berkshire, Tyne and Wear, Warwickshire and Shropshire. Health visitor drop-in clinics are “no longer running” in nearly a third of areas, and around 28% of newborn checks are being carried out via phone or video call, according to the No One Wants to See My Baby report by charities the Parent-Infant Foundation, Home-Start UK and Best Beginnings. Its authors said: “Over a year [since the first lockdown], families told us that they are still struggling to access care, particularly from universal healthcare professionals like GPs and health visitors. They told us how this left them feeling unsupported, isolated and let down.” The Institute of Health Visiting said different interpretations of government guidance meant some areas had brought back full services while others had not, creating a “postcode lottery of support for families”. It questioned official advice that routine checks could continue to be done via video and telephone calls, warning there was no evidence these were “safe or effective”. Executive director Alison Morton said: “Alongside the concerns of parents, there is a growing body of evidence that childhood conditions and disabilities are being missed, and vulnerable babies and young children are being harmed, as they are invisible to services when these assessments are not completed face to face.” Amy Brown, professor of child public health at Swansea University and author of the book Covid Babies, said: “It is astonishing that you can take your baby into a pub but not go to a baby class. You can walk into a pet shop and get your dog weighed but you can’t drop in to the health visitor and ask them to weigh your baby. “I don’t know of anything else in society that hasn’t come back, with or without restrictions… but the fact is that many of these services haven’t come back at all.” After Suzanne Ekpenyong, 40, gave birth to her second child, Malakai, in West Sussex in August, she was told by health visitors she should “look at the baby to see if he’s getting bigger”, instead of trying to get him weighed. “Parents aren’t experts – you have a mother’s instinct if something is wrong but it’s always good to get a professional to check. I am lucky not to have had problems … but I feel there’s a lack of prioritising this type of service that ultimately helps really vulnerable families,” said Ekpenyong, director of virtual assistant company Yes, from Woodford, east London. Brown added: “Cancelling weigh-ins … means parents miss the chance to ask questions and get reassurance, they feel unsupported and feel like no one is looking out for their baby. This all adds to feelings of anxiety and depression.” Postnatal depression and anxiety rates have tripled since the start of the pandemic, she said. Local councils, which run children’s centre services, have raised concerns about the shortage of health visitors, many of whom were redeployed to nursing roles in the first lockdown and have not returned. David Fothergill, chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, said councils were spending more on the under-fives than any other area of public health, despite funding cuts. He added: “Councils have adapted to provide more support online and, while recognising this may not be right for everyone, many parents have found it easier to access what they need.” A Department of Health & Social Care spokesperson said: “The NHS, local authorities and health visitors are working hard to reinstate services to help families get the support they need, and the public health grant will continue to ensure investment is made in … frontline services.”",News/Society,Mothers and babies at risk as vital health services in England stay shut,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/mothers-and-babies-at-risk-as-vital-health-services-in-england-stay-shut
12/12/2021,"Kathryn Hunter, 64, is an actor who has done more than make a name for herself in theatre. In shows for Complicité, Shared Experience and the RSC she has, with physical virtuosity, extended the reach of what theatre can do. She has played great Shakespearean male roles – Lear, Timon of Athens and Richard III – and is now starring in Joel Coen’s film The Tragedy of Macbeth, alongside Denzel Washington as Macbeth and Frances McDormand as Lady Macbeth. Hunter plays all three witches as thrilling, crow-like contortionists with voices that stir, disinter and reverberate. She lives in London with her husband, Marcello Magni, co-founder of Complicité. How did the idea of playing all three witches come about?Joel emailed me – we’ve known each other a long time and he and Fran [the actor Frances McDormand, also Coen’s wife and a producer of the film] have come to see shows I was in. He asked if I’d like to play a witch. It’s been a lifelong dream to work with Joel and Fran, so that was an immediate yes. We started talking about the how – and there were many experiments in my kitchen. I’d think: OK, the witch is a scavenger on the battlefield – she carries dead bodies around.  How did that work out in your kitchen?I made impromptu puppets of pillows, and my husband, Marcello, photographed me. Then we met with Joel and Fran in London. My first question was: “Are the witches real or in Macbeth’s mind?” Joel went: “Both.” He talked about crows, was much taken with the play’s bird imagery. He gave me the image of standing stones. Crow… woman… standing stone… these were the images percolating in my psyche. Originally, Joel thought we’d have doubles for the other witches, and we saw lots of small female contortionists. Then one day I said: what if there is one person possessed by another two? You have a twin sister… you could have invited her to audition?We’re very close, but Angela is three inches taller than me and we’re quite different… otherwise that would have been a good idea. Aikaterini Hadjipateras is your real name. You changed your first name initially, then your surname too – why?I was at Rada 40 years ago and the extraordinary principal, Hugh Cruttwell, said: “So Kathryn, do you wish to play the full canon or just Gypsies?” He told me to change my name because in those days there was more of an assumption that if you looked foreign, people might assume you couldn’t speak the language. James Hunter, a dear friend, was one of my first boyfriends. I asked him: “Do you mind if I’m Hunter?” I thought we’d end up together anyway. Unfortunately, shortly afterwards we did separate. Do you see yourself as Greek, American or British?I grew up in New York. My parents were Greek, but when I was 18 months old they emigrated again, to London. My father was in shipping and my mother went into shipping too – which was radical at the time. I’m very much a Londoner. Marcello longs to go back to Italy but I defend London. You suffered life-changing injuries in a car crash while at Rada. Did it made you extra determined to use your body superlatively – as you do – as an actor?Definitely. I remember waking up in intensive care and seeing Hugh Cruttwell at the edge of the bed. He was wearing a white suit so I thought he was an angel. My first question was: “Can I come back, Hugh?” And I did go back to Rada, on crutches, and remember people looking at me and going: Oh dear. I discovered, because of the limitations of the lower body at that time, all the upper body possibilities. I was in Lady Be Good and had to come downstairs, and I remember the cast – Ken Branagh, John Sessions – looking at me with hopeful eyes that said: don’t fall! I’ve always loved being physical. I did ballet as a small girl. Then there was Complicité – and off we went. What was special about Complicité?My first love affair was with Complicité. It was based on [the celebrated French actor] Jacques Lecoq’s idea of understanding how the body tells the story, and about an understanding of the body – and objects – in space. It was also about the story as a collective responsibility: everybody plays everything. We’d all be the outside eye – Annabel Arden, Simon McBurney… It’s fascinating because you know a scene even when it’s performed by someone else. How did you meet your husband, and does a marriage of theatre practitioners ever get too close for comfort?I’m probably one of the luckiest people in the world. We met through Complicité. I found him brilliant and hilarious and we fell in love. He asked me to marry him 15 years into our relationship and I said: “What for?”, and he was a bit disappointed. Then, after we’d been together for about 20 years, I was playing Cleopatra for the RSC and roaming around thinking: what does Cleopatra want? She wants someone she can call her husband. That inspired me… it felt right… I said: “Let’s get married,” and we did, and it was amazing. Anything goes with Marcello – he’s very game. He’s had to watch me being a crow for hours and hours… You’ve played many men long before it became fashionable.Gender is a floating thing. I gravitated towards male roles because men tend to be given more interesting things to do. There was a Complicité show where I was supposed to play a sexy maid – I balked at that. Do you think this stunning Macbeth will pull in young audiences?Denzel Washington takes us deep inside Macbeth. It’s terrifying. He has a new-minted way of speaking the lines as if it were his mother tongue, a strange and beautiful patois we grow to love. And Fran – an extraordinary human being and one of the funniest people alive – is an exceptional Lady Macbeth: you can hear her thoughts, see her feelings, and it tears you apart. It’s so exciting. I hope it will seduce young people into sharing my passion – for Shakespeare.

12/12/2021,"This week my son got his flu booster, which was about as pleasant an experience as it ever is, but now comes freighted with the added pang of political concerns. People don’t read this column for agitprop. Or rather, if they do it’s about my usual bugbears – the demented politics of Paw Patrol, the tyranny of heated plates, my continued exasperation that British people don’t thank their drivers as they exit a bus. But, occasionally, bigger themes do emerge. I speak not of my excoriating attacks on the Irish seasonal calendar or the practice of serving lasagne with coleslaw, but of vaccines – and specifically those who wish to muddy the waters around their efficacy. Like many, I’ve witnessed a small number of acquaintances becoming entrenched in their scepticism about vaccines. Darkly muttered doggerel about micro-chips and new world orders crept in during the pandemic and is now uttered regarding flu, MMR and other jabs. That these take the form of hastily pasted screeds about Bill Gates’s sudden desire to control the mind of Auntie Pauline in South Armagh, is admittedly quite funny. The fact they’re in reaction to a global pandemic, against which vaccines and boosters have been shown to be our best rebuke, is just depressing.  The last time I mentioned my son getting his flu jab was August 2019, when the charlatanry of anti-vaxxers seemed a fringe concern, albeit one about which I personally felt extremely agitated. It is striking for me to re-read that article now and see myself referencing ‘herd immunity’, a term I had to specifically look up to make sure I was using it correctly. Six months later it would become household jargon, and a new, more virulent strain of anti-vaxxer would enter the public sphere. My son is a bit of an anti-vaxxer himself, I guess, kicking and screaming, right up until the minute his booster has been administered, at which point he’s provided with stickers for his stoicism and forbearance. He doesn’t like this process and, to be honest, neither do we, but maintaining our child’s immunisations is not merely good for him, it’s good for those around us who can’t receive them, and therefore need the greater protection an inoculated populace provides them. It’s part of the social contract and one I’d be willing to oblige, even if there were no stickers. Luckily there are, which sweetens the deal marvellously. For millions of years, people got sick and died of things that no longer bother us, illnesses to which we became inoculated the hard way. Diseases so removed from our privileged position in the modern world that my son’s favourite pirate cartoons frequently make jokes about things like the black death and bubonic plague, which is a bit weird when you think about it. But comedy is, after all, tragedy plus time. It’s just that, occasionally, time marches backwards, and we should be careful that we don’t indulge the whims of those whose actions will ensure such tragedy stops being funny any more. Get your jabs and tell Auntie Pauline to do the same. It’s not enough for us to ignore the kicking and the screaming, it should be challenged and addressed wherever we find it. If we need to offer a few stickers to sweeten the deal, then so be it. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

12/12/2021,"Landscapers (Sky Atlantic)The Great (Starzplay)You Don’t Know Me (BBC One) | iPlayerHow to Make It on OnlyFans (Channel 4) | All 4 Landscapers, Sky Atlantic’s new four-part true crime drama, shouldn’t work. It stars Olivia Colman and David Thewlis as Susan and Christopher Edwards, the “Mansfield murderers”, who in 1998 shot her parents and buried them in the garden (also amassing £245,000), and were finally sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014, with a minimum of 25 years each. Written by Ed Sinclair, Colman’s husband, and directed by Will Sharpe (Giri/Haji; Flowers), Landscapers is pretentious, wayward, hyper-conceptual – eschewing realism, shredding timelines – breaks all the rules of true crime, including the good ones. It’s also extraordinary, disquieting, beautiful; television as art.  From the off (all episodes are available to stream), we’re plunged into Susan’s reality-distorting Hollywood obsession: westerns, romances, the squandering of huge sums on memorabilia, faked letters from Gérard Depardieu. The couple are impoverished in France, having been on the run for 15 years – needlessly, as nobody noticed the victims were missing – and librarian Susan lives in idealised “scenes”, casting accountant Christopher as her screen hero. This self-protective cocoon – Susan was abused by her father – is compounded by Christopher harbouring the kind of saviour complex that’s so often a front for control; even early on, their Great Love looks more of a tarted-up co-dependency doomed to shatter under pressure. This comes when Christopher gives them up and they return to England to face the police, brilliantly played by Kate O’Flynn, Samuel Anderson and Daniel Rigby, while Dipo Ola is wonderful as Susan’s kindly solicitor. Christopher’s betrayal is the moment when Susan’s mask of meekness slips to reveal childish rage, a nastiness that reminds you that, however confused the Edwards’s story of the murders becomes, murders they still were. Landscapers itself evolves into a writhing screen-Hydra of themes, moods and techniques: from black-and-white court scenes, snowy police interviews and a full-blown western sequence, to such a comprehensive smashing of the fourth wall that players leave one set to join another. Just as you think the Edwards are being too endearingly portrayed as bunglers and innocents – “My husband and I got ourselves into a bit of a pickle” – real-life news reports cut through the whimsy like a sharp syrup. Dennis Potter’s influence is here, but also Charlie Kaufman’s 2020 Netflix film I’m Thinking of Ending Things (which also starred Thewlis). The result is mesmeric and audacious, though without the anchorage of the lead performances it could still have turned into so much experimental shrapnel. Colman won an Oscar for The Favourite, but she’s even better here. She and Thewlis provide the (irregular) heartbeat of Landscapers – together, they live and breathe every strange, tortured moment of it. Tony McNamara co-wrote The Favourite, and his Starzplay dramedy The Great, about the rise of Russia’s Catherine the Great (played with wicked elan by Elle Fanning), is, well, great. Now returning for a 10-part second series, with episodes released singly until issued as a box set on Boxing Day, to say that The Great bears the weight of history lightly is an understatement. From what I can make out, it plonks on lavish costumes, sits in sumptuous palaces and feels good to go, wilfully spraying around anachronisms and outright filth like it’s Sex Education with powdered hair and corsets. You half expect Catherine’s husband, Nicholas Hoult’s Peter III, to arrive atop a skateboard, shouting his signature “Huzzah!”. As we rejoin them, Peter remains hampered by sycophants who indulge his every hot-headed move and Catherine is intent on forcing Peter to abdicate, while also bewailing her pregnancy, “a coup on your body”. While the whole cast is great, Fanning and Hoult’s chemistry is the jewel in the Greats’ imperial crown, though in Catherine’s scathing view it doesn’t exist: “I look at you and go dry like sand.” There’s more than a whiff of Blackadder here, but you won’t catch me complaining about that. You Don’t Know Me is a four-part thriller, adapted by Tom Edge (Vigil) from the book by barrister Imran Mahmood. It stars Samuel Adewunmi as Hero, a car salesman who’s dragged into the criminal underbelly in his quest to find mysterious new girlfriend (Sophie Wilde), resulting in him facing charges for the murder of local drug dealer Jamil (Roger Jean Nsengiyumva). The drama has barely begun before Hero sacks his barrister and is in court defending himself, explaining how the damning evidence (forensics, CCTV et al) isn’t proof of his guilt. From there it’s a veritable kaleidoscope of flashbacks, with occasional courtroom links. At times it all gets a bit bargain-bin Top Boy, and Hero’s relentless courtroom explanations and denials recall Shaggy’s It Wasn’t Me. Then there’s Jamil’s inexplicable survival after being shot at point-blank range: somehow he rises from the dead like a puffa-jacketed Christ. Still, You Don’t Know Me is pacy and enjoyable, with twist piled upon twist and all-round great performances, including Bukky Bakray (Rocks) as Hero’s sensitive sister. Adewunmi was wasted in the recent disappointing Angela Black, and here he’s able to showcase his skills and charisma. As Hero, he’s engulfed in emotions – love, fear, despair – proving he’s a leading man all the way. The Channel 4 documentary How to Make It on OnlyFans followed former lads’ mag model turned OnlyFans star Alex Sim-Wise as she advised others to, as she put it, “make naughty content online” on the controversial site that makes 90% of its income from sexual content. Among them were Zoe, who wanted to make extra cash indulging foot fetishists, and Emily, who styled herself as Baddie Rabbit. During the making of the documentary, OnlyFans announced a ban on sexual content and then just as abruptly withdraw it. Obviously the libertine sex positive argument was strong here, while counter-arguments (including widespread concerns about underage content providers) were in short supply. Still, this was an illuminating, humanising peek at OnlyFans contributors: Baddie, for one, suffered from everything from low self-esteem to autoimmune hepatitis.

12/12/2021,"Hurtling into town on a bike in the small hours of the morning wearing a tiger onesie might not be that unusual for the average 21-year-old. But if Amelia Luck from Fowey, Cornwall, is doing it, she isn’t rushing to a party or a rave – she is heading to the lifeboat station, responding to an emergency call-out that can come at any time of day or night. “When you hear that beep from the pager, your heart does a little jump and, well, you just run, no matter what time it is. You don’t know what situation you’re going to, you just go,” she said.  Luck has just been appointed the youngest ever female helm of a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat, taking charge of Fowey’s inshore vessel after just four years volunteering with the charity. She is one of a growing number of women across the country to have a leading role within the RNLI’s search and rescue teams, which are still very male-dominated. Like almost all RNLI crew, Luck is a volunteer who takes time out from her normal life to help those in trouble at sea whenever the call comes. She is currently doing an apprenticeship at a local cider firm but carries a pager at all times, prepared to drop everything when it goes off. “I can get to the station in a few minutes on my bike from home, although it’s harder in the summer, trying to weave through the tourists on the narrow streets,” said Luck. On average, within 13 minutes from receiving the initial instruction from the coastguard, the lifeboats are in the water. The RNLI has received criticism recently from anti-migrant groups over its role in saving people who have attempted to cross the Channel in small boats. Staff have been sent threatening emails and the charity’s website was hacked. A crew in Hastings, East Sussex, was reportedly subjected to abuse in late November as they tried to launch. When Luck heads out to sea, her only thought is for the safety of her crew and the people she is going to rescue. “When it’s stormy, you’re just worried about what’s going on out there and how the people you are going to are – how long they’ve been there and if they’re OK. That’s all you are thinking about,” she said. “You just want to get there as quickly and safely as possible.” Women still make up only 11% of the RNLI’s lifeboat crew, and when Luck joined she was the only female crew member at the station. “I remember standing there as a 17-year-old girl in a room full of men – it was pretty daunting. And I think they were a bit daunted too, worrying about things like would I need a separate changing room and loo,” she said. “But now nobody even thinks about it. I’m just another helm – I’m not treated any differently, although it took me a while to live down the tiger onesie episode.” She has been involved in 134 training and live lifeboat launches – from people cut off by the tide to paddle boarders in trouble – of which 36 were actual rescue incidents, or “shouts”, as they are called. “Every shout is different. You don’t know what you’re going to. And you don’t know what the weather’s really like until you get out there. It can be really calm here in the harbour but totally different out there,” she said. “It doesn’t matter to me about the weather because if I think to myself: if I don’t want to be out in that then think how those people are feeling out there at sea.” This December marks a sombre moment for RNLI volunteers, as they remember 40 years since one of the worst disasters. On 19 December 1981, the Penlee lifeboat, the Solomon Browne, set out in hurricane-force winds to reach a stricken cargo vessel drifting towards the rocky Cornish coast. After several attempts to rescue those onboard, contact with both vessels was lost. The eight crew of the Solomon Browne and the eight people onboard the Union Star cargo ship died. Patch Harvey, coxswain of Penlee’s current lifeboat, said, “It is important that we continue to remember the sacrifice made by the crew of the Solomon Browne, who gave everything to help others in need. They didn’t give up, and the spirit of the Solomon Browne crew lives on in all RNLI lifeboat volunteers, who continue to display the selfless commitment to saving lives at sea.” Lifeboat safety has vastly improved since the Penlee disaster, with better boats and volunteer training. But at the Fowey station, any shout still means a sleepless night for Luck’s mother, Jilly. Luck’s brother, Oli, and father, Adam, are also part of the Fowey RNLI. “My mum always said if you get a shout, please tell me, whatever time of night it is. So whenever I got paged, I’d run down the stairs and shout ‘Love you!’ as I went out the door, just to let her know that I was going. “Now my brother has a pager, and my dad, too. So the whole house is up when there is a shout at night. My mum is at the door as we go, waving us off. And she’s there when we come back too – I don’t think she even tries to go back to sleep until we’re home. “When it’s rough out there, often the whole crew will wait at the station to make sure everyone comes back safe – it’s what we do. “We’re a family. We do it for each other, and we do it for anyone in trouble at sea.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘If there’s peril, I’ll be there,’ says UK’s youngest female lifeboat helm",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/12/uk-youngest-ever-female-rnli-lifeboat-helm-appointed
12/12/2021,"The emergence and rapid spread of the Omicron Sars-CoV-2 variant feels like a flashback to last year’s grim festive season when much of the world went into lockdown to avert the worst of the Alpha variant wave. But though the sense of eerie, impending doom feels familiar, the epidemiological and political situations are different from one year ago. The Omicron wave represents a key turning point in the pandemic. But no plausible outcome looks particularly auspicious – it feels largely like a lose-lose deal. If if turns out to be roughly as severe as previous pandemic waves, it might normalise harsh mitigation measures and render the prospect of a return to post-pandemic normality fairly remote. If it turned out to be milder than feared, this could spell the end of lockdowns with Covid-19 on its way into endemicity. The cost would be a loss of trust in political and public health authorities, which may make it difficult to deal with future threats.  Omicron is a different beast to the Alpha and Delta variants, which emerged in the pre-vaccine phase of the pandemic and spread in largely immunologically naive populations. Their threat came from the increased ability to replicate quickly within their host and their higher contagiousness. Both variants were associated with higher hospital admisssion rates and deaths. However, neither variant was good at escaping immune recognition, although each could cause occasional “breakthrough infections” in immunised people, with high contagiousness allowing these variants to barge through the first-line immune defence. Omicron is different. Rather than just relying on brute force, as Delta did, it is far better at sneaking through immune defences, thanks to a number of mutations that it acquired in key regions of its spike protein. These reduce the ability of neutralising antibodies to bind to it. As such, it spreads primarily by (re-)infecting previously immunised hosts. The centre of the Omicron outbreak was Gauteng province in South Africa, which experienced a dramatic rise of nearly 400% in the number of cases in the first week of December. The Gauteng outbreak seems to be receding with its peak expected within a week or so. Other regions of South Africa also show signs of their epidemics slowing down despite no measures having been taken to suppress transmission. Many countries are seeing rapid rises of Omicron cases, which are recorded as doubling every two to three days in the UK. But there is considerable uncertainty about the virulence of Omicron. Early, largely anecdotal, evidence from South Africa suggested Omicron might be milder. Such data has to be interpreted carefully as essentially all infections start with mild symptoms and there is a time lag before severe disease develops. As additional data has landed in the past two weeks, the hypothesis of the Omicron wave being significantly milder becomes increasingly plausible. Reported deaths and hospitalisations in South Africa, in particular those requiring intensive care or ventilation, have remained far below numbers recorded during previous waves. Virulence is not just a property of a pathogen but of the interaction with its host. Most populations on Earth have acquired high rates of immunisation through vaccination and prior infection. While Omicron can largely bypass neutralising antibodies, it remains well recognised by T-cells, which do the heavy lifting to control infections that can’t be averted. As such, vaccines largely retain their efficacy against severe symptoms caused by the variant and a recent third dose still seems to provide significant protection against infection. Irrespective of the relative virulence of Omicron, the large peak of cases anticipated over the coming weeks is expected to add further stress to healthcare services, which no government can allow to become overwhelmed under its watch. A case for harsh mitigation measures based entirely on the protection of healthcare services might be less well received by many nearly two years into the pandemic, in particular given the uncertainty around the severity of Omicron. The first lockdowns in early 2020 were generally well accepted by the population as a temporary measure in the face of an exceptional threat. Many felt that later lockdowns were justified as a means to delay the epidemic until the population could be vaccinated. A lockdown to deal with Omicron may be a more difficult sell; it comes with no obvious endpoint besides its objective to “flatten the curve” and allow for a marginal increase in the number of people vaccinated or boosted before the peak of the wave. How to respond to the Omicron wave poses extreme challenges to political and public health authorities globally. So far, western governments have enforced early, harsh travel bans against African countries, which have been widely criticised, including by the World Health Organization. Given the rapid rise in local community transmission of Omicron, those travel restrictions have lost all efficacy they might have had early on. Increasing the rate of vaccination, including third doses, in particular for those most at risk, should make a real difference in terms of morbidity and mortality over the coming months, but time is rapidly running out given the remarkably fast increase in daily Omicron case numbers. Many governments are also taking more intrusive or coercive measures, which could rapidly escalate to compare with previous lockdowns. How effective those measures are at reducing viral transmission over the coming weeks will largely depend on the population’s willingness to follow the rules. In the absence of a clear sense of fear and a possible loss of trust, adherence may be far lower. As I noted, Omicron’s legacy could be huge if its impact proves to be especially rough or mild. But even an intermediate outcome might cause additional resentment and further the deep divisions in society.
