4/21/2022,"Russia and Ukraine both declared that Moscow’s offensive in the Donbas region had begun this week – although, in reality, the air and artillery bombardment by Moscow’s forces over the past 48 hours is not yet the intensive attack signalled by the Kremlin when it abandoned its attempt to seize Kyiv. The strategy is well known: Russia aims to mass its previously overextended forces in the east of the country, where it hopes to gain an advantage of two or perhaps three to one over the Ukrainian defenders, encircling them by attacking south from Izium and, once Mariupol falls, pushing up from there north. But the key point, for now, is that Russia is far from marshalling all its considerable remaining forces for the fight to come. Pentagon officials said on Tuesday that the attacks so far were simply “a prelude to larger offensive operations” that will determine whether the fighting amounts to a relatively short or far longer war. After two months of fighting, the crude estimate from the US is that Russia has 75% of its combat power still available and 78 of its battalion tactical groups in Ukraine. At full strength, that would amount to about 62,000, though the figure is likely to be lower, plus thousands more separatists, mercenaries and other irregular forces. Several thousand Russian troops – 12 battalions, estimates the US – remain tied up in the final stages of the battle for Mariupol, trying to take control of the vast Azovstal steelworks in the city. Others are still being reconstituted after the defeat near Kyiv, however, so the buildup is expected to be gradual. “The Russian gameplan is potentially to launch a slow and methodical offensive, to prevent a repeat of the ill-coordinated and costly operations in February and March,” said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare expert at the Rusi thinktank. Then Russia’s mistake was to send mechanised forces down main roads, allowing them to be picked off by Ukrainian infantry armed with British and other anti-tank bazookas. All of which means that it is highly unlikely that President Vladimir Putin will be able to announce mission accomplished in time for the annual 9 May parade that commemorates Russia’s victory in the second world war. But it does not mean that Russia could not defeat Ukraine’s mainland army in the weeks thereafter. Western intelligence does not like to estimate the size of the Ukrainian forces ranged against Russia, although at the start of the war the number of Donbas defenders was estimated at 40,000 to 45,000. These will have been augmented by the country’s mass mobilisation at the start of the war, and some reinforcements from Kyiv. But, as Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy acknowledged in a recent CNN interview, his country has suffered an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 troops dead and 10,000 wounded. The pleas for more munitions and more powerful weapons continue, and a key weapon is likely to be artillery as both sides try to break each other’s defensive lines in fighting to some extent reminiscent of the first world war. Russia began the war with two-and-a-half times the number of artillery pieces, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. And, according to a Pentagon briefing on Tuesday, it still retains “more than 80%” of both the heavy guns and the munitions required, which can shell Ukraine’s frontlines from positions as far as 30 miles away. But the worry is that Ukraine, its industrial base decimated, will gradually run out of the Soviet 152mm standard rounds it uses in its heavy guns. There are limited supplies around Nato of the Russian weapons it has conventionally used, which is why a week ago – recognising Ukraine’s need – the US said it would send 18 155mm western-standard howitzers and 40,000 artillery rounds. However, 18 howitzers represent a fraction of Ukraine’s total artillery, placing pressure on Nato members and in particular the US to supply more if the fighting intensifies – another example of how Kyiv is dependent on the west to help its forces stave off the anticipated Russian onslaught. Moscow’s Donbas attack may be predictable: what is not yet clear is whether Ukraine can grind it to a standstill.",News/World news, Ukraine’s access to weapons could determine fate of Donbas offensive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/ukraine-access-weapons-determine-fate-donbas-offensive
4/21/2022,"Mikhail Afanasyev knew the police could come for him. The veteran investigative reporter had just published an explosive report: 11 members of the Russian National Guard from his home region of Khakassia had refused to fight in Ukraine, he said, and the military was hiding information about their unit’s casualties from the public. The report matched others about refusenik soldiers and reinforced a narrative that the Russian government desperately wanted to suppress: that the invasion was stalling and Russian troops were ill-prepared to fight. In an effort to stop the bad press, the hunt for enemies like Afanasyev intensified. “They are trying to find the sources,” Afanasyev wrote in a text message days before his arrest. “While I’m writing, I’m waiting to be arrested.” He had already seen an order from the prosecutor demanding a legal review of his article and he expected far worse to come. “They’ve already fired the [soldiers] and there’s a real hunt for us too,” he wrote. On 13 April, police made arrests in three cities spread across the country, under a new law criminalising “fakes” about the Russian army. Afanasyev was detained in Siberia, a mayoral aide allegedly running a Telegram account was detained in Elista in the North Caucasus, and in the Moscow region, Sergei Mikhailov, the founder of the LIStok weekly newspaper, was arrested. The synchronised arrests suggested a new coordinated campaign targeting regional journalists, especially those who had published information about Russian losses in the war. Overall, 28 cases have been reported under the “fakes” law, which was signed by Vladimir Putin last month, according to OVD-Info, which monitors Russia’s legal system. Afanasyev faces up to 10 years in prison. “Mikhail wrote an article about the national guardsmen and now he is being punished for it,” said his lawyer, Vladimir Vasin. “His position is ‘I did my job! I couldn’t do anything else’, that’s what he told me.” The crackdown has made it even harder for Russian soldiers who have refused to fight in the “special operation” – Russia’s term for its war – to go public. Some reports suggest there are nearly 1,000 such cases. Pavel Chikov, the chair of the Agora human rights group, said this month the group was fielding cases from 17 cities and “everyone is complaining about pressure, threats of criminal prosecution”. “They’re more afraid than I am,” said a lawyer from another region in touch with soldiers who had refused to fight in Ukraine. “For them, it is scarier than taking part in the special operation.” On the night of his arrest, Afanasyev and his wife, Elena, had been hoping to celebrate their anniversary, but he had been held up at work. When Elena answered a knock at the door, an officer with a warrant entered, followed by men in masks and camouflage, and then her husband in handcuffs. “They said to hide the kids in another room so that they don’t get in our way because it’s unpleasant,” Elena said. “I hugged my husband tightly; the kids couldn’t stay in the room, his son ran out crying and called for his father. Misha took him in his arms.” “I asked him, ‘Misha, they will just detain you for 48 hours and then they will release you, right?’ He reassured me: ‘My cat, everything will be all right, don’t worry … I’ll be home soon.’” Afanasyev is one of the best-known journalists in Siberia, a driven and aggressive reporter who runs long cross-country trails in his time off. He independently manages Novy Fokus, a committee to protect journalistsand has defied court summons, beatings and death threats to report on issues of corruption and human rights abuses. “He’s a journalist hero for Khakassia,” said Stanislav Ugdyzhekov, a friend who has known him for more than 20 years. “He got involved in very complex questions. He fought with bandits. And I know they were bandits because they were jailed for banditry. He fought with the state organs. He exposed some bad people in the government.” Afanasyev had paid for that deal in years of problems, including libel charges in 2009 brought because of his criticism of the Russian government’s response to an explosion at the country’s largest hydroelectric plant that year. “I thought these 10 years of criminal persecutions were behind him,” said Elena. “He’s a respected person around the world, and in Khakassia. I couldn’t imagine that we could have raids and all this. It was a normal evening.” Afanasyev has been placed in custody for the next two months as investigators build their case against him. The lawyer, Vasin, said he had met Afanasyev on Wednesday at a pre-trial detention centre. Afanasyev had a shaved head, he said, and had been through three interrogations, three house searches and an arrest in the past seven days. “Mikhail feels a bit better than in the first days,” said Vasin. “At first he was subdued, lost. He didn’t quite believe that he could be imprisoned for his words. Not just for words, but for journalism.” There has not been a successful defence against the “fakes” law yet. And at least four investigators had been assigned to the case, suggesting it will go to trial. “There is only one way for journalists to defend themselves from these accusations and laws and that is to quit journalism,” said Vasin. “Or to shut up.”",News/World news,Russia ‘fakes’ law targets journalists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/im-waiting-to-be-arrested-russian-fake-news-law-targets-journalists
4/21/2022,"It has charmed critics and attracted big audiences in the UK and the US, but the TV adaptation of Min Jin Lee’s bestselling novel Pachinko has barely merited a mention in one of the countries that inspired it. The eight-part drama, currently streaming on Apple TV+, evokes the universal migrant experience, but it is also an uncomfortable reminder of the bitter historical legacy of Japan’s colonial rule over the Korean peninsula. The story of a family who leave Busan in South Korea for Osaka’s Korean quarter in the early 20th century, Pachinko’s narrative draws on the real-life experiences of the zainichi, the name for people of Korean descent who form one of Japan’s biggest ethnic minorities. Kang Mijija’s family moved to Japan after the second world war, and encountered a country that offered opportunity, but at a price. As immigrants hailing from the Korean peninsula – freed from 35 years of Japanese colonial rule at the end of the second world war – they were easy targets for locals who despised their new neighbours. “People threw water and even stones at my aunties,” Kang, a second-generation zainichi, told the Guardian at a café in Tsuruhashi, an Osaka neighbourhood with a large ethnic Korean community. “That was a really difficult time. Now we live in a grey zone … those extremes have gone, but there is still systemic discrimination and hate speech.” Kang’s parents were first-generation zainichi – Japan’s 430,000-strong Korean diaspora, many of them the descendants of people forcibly brought to Japan as labourers before and during the second world war. Just as Pachinko – named after the pinball-like gaming machine that has given many ethnic Koreans a livelihood– appeared last month, audiences in Japan were confronted with another chapter in their country’s troubled relationship with its neighbour. Shusenjo, a documentary by director Miki Dezaki, examines the controversy over the “comfort women” – an estimated tens of thousands of women and girls, mainly from the Korean peninsula, who were coerced into working in Japanese military brothels before and during the second world war. Dezaki, who recently took his documentary around Japan and to the US, had to fight off a legal challenge from right-wing commentators who claimed they had not given their consent to appear in the film. “The right-wing nationalist view of the comfort women issue is now the mainstream narrative in Japan,” he says. Under its longest-serving prime minister, Shinzo Abe, Japan set about dismantling its “masochism” over the war, casting doubt on accepted narratives about the Japanese military’s role in recruiting comfort women and the use of zainichi as forced labour. “This accelerated the overall intolerant atmosphere in Japanese society,” says Satoko Oka Norimatsu, a co-coordinator of the International Network of Museums for Peace. “Japanese people do not think racism exists in Japan, and they do not like to face up to the fact that they are active perpetrators of racism against the zainichi.” Dezaki noted how little coverage his legal victory had attracted, even in Japan’s liberal media. “Unless Japanese news media, especially TV news media, cover my film or Pachinko, there will be no balance,” he said. The balance has tipped in favour of conservative, revisionist interpretations of history. Japan has pushed bids for Unesco world heritage status for sites that used Korean workers. Under government pressure, school textbooks that will be introduced next year omit the word “forced” to describe wartime labourers and make no mention of the military’s role in recruiting comfort women. While legal crackdowns on hate speech have weakened far-right groups such as Zaitokukai, which calls for the removal of supposed “privileges” for ethnic Koreans, there are no penalties for violators, and much of the abuse has migrated online. Few believe the films – along with a recent freedom of speech exhibition in Tokyo that included a statue symbolising the comfort women – will be enough to rein in rightwing narratives about the zainichi and Japan’s wartime conduct. “I don’t think the far right is going to shut up anytime soon,” says Bang Chungja, a second-generation zainichi Korean who belongs to an Osaka-based network demanding compensation and an official apology for victims of wartime sexual slavery. “Japan should recognise the truth of history … Japanese people suffered terribly in the war too, but they were not the only victims.” The Japanese consulate in Lyon reportedly tried to prevent Shusenjo from being shown at the city’s Institut d’Estudes Politiques, while Japanese officials have backed campaigns for the removal of comfort women statues in the US and Germany. “It’s good that people who watched the film may become interested in the issue of the comfort women, but their supporters are losing the fight in Japan,” says Tomomi Yamaguchi, an associate professor of anthropology at Montana State University. “The Japanese government and the mainstream media have taken the stance that Japan is not responsible for sexual slavery [during the war]. While younger people may be interested in Korean pop culture, mainstream Japanese society is stuck in a revisionist version of history.” Kang, though, was cautiously optimistic that Pachinko and Shusenjo could raise awareness of the Korean experience in Japan. “I think Min Jin Lee intended to tell our story to the entire world, and it’s good that people are learning about the zainichi.”",News/World news,‘A difficult time’: why popular TV series Pachinko was met with silence in Japan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/pachinko-tv-series-korea-japan-min-jin-lee
