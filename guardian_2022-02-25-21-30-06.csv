2/25/2022,"Up in the posh seats, one extremely astute judge of talent was watching with interest. Chelsea were taking on Al-Hilal in the semi-finals of the Club World Cup and, as far as Arsène Wenger was concerned, the chance to have a close look at Kai Havertz was not to be missed. For those near Wenger at the Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, it was impossible not to notice how much the former Arsenal manager appreciated Havertz’s game: the elusive movement, the way he kept popping up in unexpected positions, the sense that the Chelsea attacker was always on the verge of producing something special. But it never quite happened for the young German. When he charged down the left and lifted a cross into the area in the 32nd minute, it required a defensive mix-up from Al-Hilal to gift Romelu Lukaku the winning goal. Then, when the former Bayer Leveruksen player tore through midway through the second half, he hit the post when he had the chance to score a magnificent solo goal. It was another one of those nearly moments from Havertz. Sometimes it seems his curse is almost scoring great goals. He can be indulgent with his finishing and for all his elegant movement there are times when he seems reluctant to push the limits, which has stopped him from becoming a more dominant figure for Chelsea. Nonetheless the depth of Havertz’s ability is obvious. Wenger glimpsed it from afar and Thomas Tuchel has seen it up close. So, too, have Havertz’s Chelsea teammates. They had faith even when he was struggling to adapt to English football last season. Seasoned players saw in training that Havertz was capable of moments of individual brilliance. Yet he remains a work in progress: a £62m star who finds himself in the weird position of having secured his place in Chelsea’s history, only to find that nobody is quite sure whether he is going to make the most of his vast potential. Havertz’s time at Chelsea has not been spectacular, but it has been special. It is not clear whether he is best as a false nine or a classic No 10. But what do you focus on more? The disappointment of six goals in 44 league appearances or the glory of scoring the winner against Manchester City in last season’s Champions League final? An inability to become a mandatory pick or the nerveless penalty that saw off Palmeiras when Chelsea became world champions for the first time this month? The positive take is that Havertz, now 22, thrives under pressure. Based on his big-game record, he should be in his element when Chelsea face Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. Havertz has already scored against Jürgen Klopp’s side this season – a clever header in front of the Kop last August – and Chelsea are more fluid and aggressive when he is up front instead of Lukaku, who was dropped against Lille last Tuesday. Havertz took his chance against Lille. He pressed energetically, moved cleverly, linked the play and scored a good goal, so there is little reason for Tuchel to restore Lukaku to the lineup on Sunday. However Havertz’s inconsistency means there are no guarantees he will rise to the occasion. He has not developed the relentlessness of Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, whose productivity puts Chelsea’s misfiring forwards to shame. This could be a galling experience for the Chelsea hierarchy. They have decent attacking players, but none belong to the elite. There is, as one staff member privately acknowledged this season, nobody in the class of Salah or Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. That, of course, is on Chelsea. “Thanks, José!” was how one figure put it recently, pointing out that Mourinho, during his second spell at Stamford Bridge, sold two players who are now among the Premier League’s best. Salah was 21 when Chelsea signed him from Basel in 2014. The Egyptian was exciting but Mourinho did not take to him or De Bruyne. Both were banished to the sidelines and players from that era remember feeling embarrassed by Mourinho’s treatment of Salah. Chelsea cannot head down that path again. This is the first time they will have faced Salah in a major final and one look at him in a red shirt should be enough to convince them not to let Liverpool profit from their impatience again. Of course, too many expensive forwards are underperforming at Chelsea and it is not a surprise that some have grown unhappy. It is not just about Lukaku, who is probably going nowhere given that he cost £97.5m last summer. Tuchel also has to think about Timo Werner, who would probably benefit from a change of scenery, and there could be another difficult conversation if Christian Pulisic wants to leave. Pulisic, under contract until 2024, could well turn out to be another Salah. The 23-year-old has not lived up to the hype since his £58m move from Borussia Dortmund in 2019 but he is not a lost cause. The American is a dynamic threat when confident and his goal against Lille, who could not handle his speed and directness, was a reminder of what he can do when fully fit. These are complicated times for Chelsea. The summer could bring change but the memory of losing Salah and De Bruyne adds a layer of intrigue to the decision-making process. It is a cautionary tale; one that tells Chelsea it would be wise to give Havertz room to grow. He has not pushed on as expected after his heroics against City last May, but he is heading in the right direction. After all, one of the reasons Chelsea have made it to Wembley is because of Havertz scoring in the semi-final against Tottenham. Maybe Arsène still knows.",Sport/Football,Chelsea need Kai Havertz to start being more than their sometimes man | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/25/chelsea-kai-havertz-carabao-cup-final-sometimes-man
2/25/2022,"Formula One has cancelled the Russian Grand Prix after the state’s invasion of Ukraine. The sport did not issue any condemnation of Russia but cited the “impossibility” of holding the race under the current circumstances. The meeting was set to take place on 25 September and Turkey has been discussed as a potential replacement but F1 is not yet understood to be considering the Istanbul Park Circuit as an option at this time. However, it has been used twice in the last two years, stepping in for races cancelled due to the Covid pandemic. On Thursday evening F1’s CEO Stefano Domenicali held a meeting with the team principals and the FIA to discuss the Russian GP, with clear, widespread opinion that the sport could not go to Russia while it engaged in an invasion of Ukraine. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner had described the idea of going to Russia as simply untenable and the world champion Max Verstappen had decried the idea of going racing in a country that had declared war on a neighbouring state. Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to declare he would boycott the race if it went ahead. A statement from F1 read: “The FIA Formula 1 World Championship visits countries all over the world with a positive vision to unite people, bringing nations together. We are watching the developments in Ukraine with sadness and shock and hope for a swift and peaceful resolution to the present situation. On Thursday evening Formula One, the FIA, and the teams discussed the position of our sport, and the conclusion is, including the view of all relevant stakeholders, that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances.” On Friday Uefa dropped Russia as host of the Champions League final in St Petersburg, replacing it with the Stade de France in Paris. The teams are completing the third and final day of their first test in Barcelona on Friday, where the Haas team removed the Russian flag-based livery of its title sponsor Uralkali from their cars, trucks and motorhomes. Uralkali is a Russian chemical company with Dmitry Mazepin as deputy chairman of the Uralkali board and Uralchem CEO. He is the father of Haas driver Nikita Mazepin and is an associate of Vladimir Putin, attending the Kremlin for a meeting called by Putin on Thursday. The future of the team’s association with Uralkali remains in doubt, according to sanctions that may be imposed, raising questions over the team’s financial stability. Michael Schumacher’s son Mick is currently entering his second season in F1 with Haas. Equally Mazepin’s status as a driver may be under threat with the potential for visa bans being imposed on Russian nationals. Only three countries that host F1 meetings currently admit Russians without a visa, Azerbaijan, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. The Haas owner Gene Haas was at the Circuit de Catalunya on Friday with team principal Guenther Steiner, who insisted the team were not at risk should they end their association with Uralkali, a decision on which would be made in the next few weeks. “It is a headache but it’s not something that disturbs the team,” he said. “Financially we are ok. It has no implementation on the team, how we are running, how we plan the season, there are more ways to get the funding, we have no issues with that.” Steiner did concede that he was unaware how the removal of Russia from the Swift payment network, should it occur, impact on the team but was expectant they were well placed to work around any issues and be ready to compete at the first race of the season in Bahrain on 20 March. “We had to take a decision and I think this was the right decision to take,” he said of removing the Uralkali sponsorship in Barcelona. “There is no setback on the competition side of the team because of this, we just need to go through the commercial issues and we will go through that in the next few weeks but it is a to-do list, nothing more.”",Sport/Sport,Russian F1 GP cancelled and set for Turkey switch after Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/russian-grand-prix-set-for-switch-turkey-after-ukraine-invasion-motor-sport-formula-one-f1
2/25/2022,"A subsidiary of Russia’s second largest bank, VTB, has been suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange after the UK’s imposition of sanctions over Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The London Stock Exchange Group said on Friday it had suspended VTB Capital’s membership with immediate effect, meaning it can no longer trade in the British capital. The move comes after Boris Johnson announced what he called the “largest ever” range of sanctions against Russian firms and individuals, freezing the assets of all the main Russian banks, including VTB. VTB, which is majority owned by the state and has interests in banking assets across eastern Europe, has assets totalling £154bn. Legislation is expected to be tabled next week to ban major Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to prevent Moscow from raising sovereign debt in London. “Sanctions are a reality for us over the last few years and another round of politically motivated anti-Russian sanctions did not come as a surprise,” VTB said in a statement. There are a number of VTB executives, and those with links to the bank, who feature in the government’s list of individuals against whom it has levelled sanctions. These include VTB’s president-chair, Andrey Kostin, who is also a member of the supreme council of the United Russia political party, as well as high-ranking executives Andrey Puchkov and Yuri Alekseyevich Soloviev. Denis Bortnikov, the deputy chair of VTB Bank’s management board, is also on the sanctions list. He is a deputy president of VTB Bank and chair of its management board. As well as this, he is the son of Aleksandr Bortnikov, a director of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who has been on the sanctions list since March 2021. Russian politicians involved with the bank who also feature on the sanctions list include the deputy prime minister and chief of the government staff, Dmitry Grigorenko, who is chair of the supervisory council of VTB Bank. As a former director of the Russian tax service, he set up a new tax system in Crimea after its annexation. Also featured is Maxim Reshetnikov, the minister of economic development, who is a member of the supervisory council of the VTB Bank.",News/Business,Russia’s VTB Capital suspended from London Stock Exchange,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/russia-vtb-capital-suspended-london-stock-exchange
2/25/2022,"Russian forces have reached Kyiv, a day after attacking Ukraine from three sides on a massive scale. Air raid sirens wailed over the city and heavy gunfire and explosions were heard in a number of districts, as Russian military vehicles approached from the north-west. There was also significant fighting near Ivankiv, about 40 miles north-west of Kyiv, and Russian troops entered the city of Sumy, which sits on a highway leading to Kyiv from the east. Russia attacked Ukraine on multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv, including an ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase. Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. One Russian line came through the Senkivka border crossing near Chernihiv. A substantial attack was also aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. Social media footage showed them reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 130km inside Ukraine. Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric also grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and APCs on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia: Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. Half of Russia’s air force is now deployed near Ukraine, according to western estimates. Russian warships conducted training exercises in the Black Sea in the run-up to the invasion. This footage released by the Russian Ministry of Defence shows a Ka-27PS helicopter taking off and landing on the deck of a frigate during exercises on 22 February: These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year: Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye in western Crimea. The US estimates 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. This image from 18 February shows deployments including armour, helicopters and field hospitals in Novoozernoye: Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to what the UK defence secretary described as potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,Russia’s war on Ukraine explained: a complete visual guide,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/the-ukraine-russia-crisis-explained-a-complete-visual-guide

The trading and mining company’s headquarters are in Switzerland but it operates in Ukraine, where it has three mines and a production facility. It said that export facilities at the port of Pivdennyi in the south-west of Ukraine have been “temporarily suspended following notification from the port authorities”. The company said: “As a result, the group’s marketing department has issued force majeure notices to certain customers that were due to receive the group’s products via oceangoing vessels in the near term.” The group, which on Thursday said that the Ukrainian government had suspended rail transportation, said its mining operations near the city of Horishni Plavni in central Ukraine, were continuing to operate. “The group has the ability to stockpile its iron ore pellets at site while Ukraine’s logistic networks continue to experience disruption,” the company said. “The group’s continued primary focus remains the safety of its workforce in Ukraine.” Ferrexpo shares were down 2% in London on Friday morning.

2/25/2022,"The news came as a surprise to many in Beijing. Barely 24 hours ago, Chinese pundits predicted that a war in Ukraine was not inevitable. In New York, as Russia geared up for a full-on assault on its neighbour, China’s UN envoy, Zhang Jun, urged in a security council meeting that “the door to a peaceful solution to the Ukraine issue is not fully shut, nor should it be shut”. But when people in Kyiv woke up to sound of bombs in what the Nato chief called a “deliberate, cold-blooded” invasion, the door had clearly been closed. China’s state media, however, insisted it was a “special military action” by Russia. Quoting Vladimir Putin, China’s central television tweeted: “Russia was left with no other choice.” Chinese netizens were fascinated by Russia’s move. Three weeks ago, Putin was the guest of honour at the Beijing Winter Olympics. On 4 February, he and Xi Jinping pledged that there would be “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation” in their bilateral relationship. On Thursday, millions took to the social media site Weibo to discuss it. So much so, a new phrase was coined: Wu Xin Gong Zuo（乌心工作）to describe those who were so concerned with the situation in Ukraine they could not focus on work. The reality on the ground contrasted with the official Chinese media narrative, yet it also offered a glimpse into the tightrope Beijing is walking. On Thursday, as she refused to use the word “invasion” to describe Russia’s action, the foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying, also indicated that China would not provide arms to Russia. “I believe that as a strong country, Russia doesn’t need China or other countries to provide weapons to it,” she said. Bonny Lin, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, said “Besides China’s effort to balance its various goals, all indications point to the fact that China prioritises its relationship with Russia at the moment,”, adding that Moscow’s action also posed a problem for Beijing. In public, Beijing advocates the position that sovereignty is sacrosanct. This is a discourse it often deploys when it talks about Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province. On the other hand, the Ukraine crisis offers Beijing the opportunity to express grievances against its common adversaries with Russia: the US and Nato. So far, the latter appears to be weighing heavier in Beijing’s messaging. This explains why Hua on Thursday invoked the memories of a diplomatic incident from more than 20 years ago. On 7 May 1999, Nato missiles struck the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and set it ablaze in a predawn strike, killing three Chinese nationals. The US claimed it was a “mistake” caused by an out-of-date map, but China was never convinced. “Chinese elites operate in a way that political gains can be prioritised over economic gains,” according to Zeno Leoni, a defence expert at King’s College London. “Right now China’s political goal is to weaken the US-led liberal order. This means that it could accept some economic disruption and continue to publicly support Russia – a marriage of convenience – for the sake of a political objective.” Lin said the further escalation of events was likely to worsen China’s relationship with the US and the EU and push countries such as Japan and Australia further away from China. “In the near term, China will be impacted by secondary sanctions and these costs for China will likely increase as the situation in Ukraine deteriorates.” In unveiling the latest round of sanctions on Thursday, Joe Biden took a swipe at Beijing, saying any country that backed Russia’s onslaught in Ukraine would be “stained by association”. “Putin will be a pariah on the international stage,” he declared. The impression will further deepen as China on the same day announced it was fully open to Russian wheat imports. But Leoni said that if military tensions were to escalate across Europe – where China has major economic interests – Beijing’s attitude might still change. “We have seen recently how both Nato’s and Russia’s naval assets have been positioning or involved in trainings in the Mediterranean Sea: Beijing might change its calculus about Russia should military hostilities extend, even mildly, to this region where the bulk of China’s trade with Europe travels through.” Western leaders are alarmed by Beijing’s response as they see the implications for the US-led postwar world order being fundamentally reshaped as a result of Russia’s action. “What we need to make sure in our response today is that we don’t just have a tactical response … But we have a long-term response to the threat to the democratic order,” Jeremy Hunt, a former British foreign secretary, told BBC Radio 4. “There are now two very big powers, Russia and China, that are absolutely committed to upending that order. And that is why we have to think long and hard and smart about what to do next.” Beijing is aware of the diplomatic fallout such a response would cause. But a government researcher, who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter, quipped: “Even if China joined the west in sanctioning Russia or criticising Russia, will the US-China relations improve?” “We don’t want to face such a difficult choice, either,” he added, admitting Beijing’s dilemma but insisting its policy had to be pragmatic. “After all, China and Russia share a 4,000km-long border. In the long run, China has to be on good terms with Russia.” To realist Chinese foreign policy thinkers, geography and history continue to be relevant in their reasoning of the new world order. The deadly Soviet-China border conflict in 1969 still casts a shadow for Beijing particularly as Biden frames America’s China challenge as “democracy v autocracy”. “We are in the middle of massive changes [in geopolitics] and if you look around, many countries have been adventurous in recent years. For China, it is an opportunity as well as a challenge,” the Beijing- based government researcher said. “Adding the pandemic factor, it’s going to be very chaotic in the years to come.”",News/World news,China ponders how Russia’s actions in Ukraine could reshape world order ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/china-ponders-how-russia-actions-ukraine-reshape-world-order
2/25/2022,"From yams to chocho to ackee, a new exhibition is shining a light on south London’s Caribbean gardens, created by the Windrush generation who moved to Britain after the second world war. The Sowing Roots exhibition at the Garden Museum in Lambeth explores how Caribbean horticultural heritage has enriched British gardening. It tells the stories of 15 individuals through interview extracts, photographs and artefacts – including a pair of dirty gardening gloves, horticulture books and herbal teas. The idea for the exhibition came after the Windrush scandal in 2018, which exposed how thousands of Caribbean people who had been invited to the UK as British citizens had been wrongly targeted with deportation. The exhibition looks at how cultivating land has helped Caribbean communities to feel at home and rooted in the UK. “The resulting oral histories shed light on the varied traditions that Caribbean people carried with them when they moved to Britain,” a panel at the start of the exhibition reads. “We hope to have unearthed the inventiveness, creativity and power at the heart of Caribbean gardening that has shaped families, communities and empire across time and space.” Through gardening, people in the diaspora have been able to connect with their cultural heritage. “The exhibition filled the spot for me, and I know for many gardeners of colour. It’s shone a light on what we’ve been doing for a long time, and given us a little platform,” says Ras Prince Morgan, who was born in Rock River in Clarendon, Jamaica, and migrated to London in 1969 when he was seven years old. Morgan created his garden 16 years ago on disused land filled with Japanese knotweed on the edge of playing fields in Lewisham, south-east London. He initially just wanted to grow some fruit trees so his children would know where their food came from; now he grows plants from all over the world and runs horticultural and educational projects. One of Morgan’s inspirations is Alan Titchmarsh. He loves London’s Kew and Hampton Court Gardens, the Eden Project in Cornwall, and many other European-led institutions, but is frustrated by the lack of visibility of Africans involved in creating this rich history. “Gardening has been such a very European-led institution,” he says. “It paints the picture that Africans were never involved, but that is the furthest thing from the truth. It’s only when you do your research, then you realise we were the backbone of the industry. [White people] were in control, passing the orders and instructions down the line, where we were to carry them out.” Part of Morgan’s motivation for growing things was to increase diversity in gardening in the UK. He now has more than 10 volunteers helping him, and most are people of colour. He has noticed the climate getting warmer over the past 10 years, meaning he is able to grow more heat-loving plants outside, such as bananas, avocados, sugar cane and angel’s trumpet. “I grew yam on my veranda and had dinner from it. That just blew my mind. People say you can’t grow yam over here, it’s not hot enough, but I grew a piece of yam on my veranda!” he says. Morgan gardens according to the cycles of the moon and uses a horoscope book called Old Moore’s Almanack, which has information on lunar rising and setting times and when is the right time to plant what. His mother – and probably his grandmother too – used the same book. Another story included in the exhibition is that of Earline Hilda Castillo Binger, who was born in Trinidad and moved to the UK in 1971 and became a nurse. She is now a community gardener and leads gardening sessions on land belonging to GP surgeries in Lambeth. “There’s a bush for everything. Every ailment you have, there’s a bush,” she says in her interview for the exhibition. “You know, this gardening has taken me on a journey, a very interesting journey.” Subsistence and small-scale farming occupies a unique place in the history of Caribbean peoples, says historian Dr Elizabeth Cooper, who curated the exhibition. “Sowing Roots taps into this history and the ways that migrants from the Caribbean carried meanings and traditions of gardening with them when they moved to the UK – and in turn transformed the uses and meanings of green spaces in south London,” she says.

Portrait of a Man by Hans Baldung Grien, 1514You can see age and decay starting to eat at this portrait. It’s not just the sharply observed face of the unknown man with his time-hewn skin and the grey in his beard and hair. In spite of the gold insignia that he wears, his fur collar looks a little the worse for wear. Perhaps this is not much. But the strange sheen of that hair is vividly reminiscent of Hans Baldung Grien’s similarly silvery images in other works including pictures of witches at the sabbath, or his painting The Ages of Woman and Death, in the Prado. There too, aged hair is emphasised – including the horrible matted hair of a skeleton that holds an hourglass. Here, with terrible irony, the man’s name is lost but the year is known, 1514, as his time ticks away. This is a subtle and self-controlled, yet haunting image by an artist just about holding his macabre imagination in check. National Gallery, London To follow us on Twitter: @GdnArtandDesign.

Can Bears Ski? by Raymond Antrobus and Polly Dunbar (Walker, £7.99)Another first picture book from an acclaimed poet, in which a small bear is baffled by people asking “Can bears ski?” until he visits an audiologist, and discovers they were really saying: “Can you hear me?” Drawing vividly on Antrobus’s childhood experience with undiagnosed deafness, this new paperback edition comes with a BSL alphabet, as well as Polly Dunbar’s inimitably cuddly illustrations. Mayor Bunny’s Chocolate Town by Elys Dolan (OUP, £11.99)Dolan’s rascally rabbit is back, with political ambitions.

A hilarious, all-too-relevant satire of dirty tricks and comeuppance, with engaging comic-style details. It Fell from the Sky by the Fan Brothers (Quarto, £12.99)When a curious object falls from the sky, the garden insects all have theories about it, while unscrupulous Spider detects a business opportunity and begins charging his neighbours to view it.

Luma and the Pet Dragon by Leah Mohammed, illustrated by Loretta Schauer (Welbeck Flame, £6.99)Luma is thrilled to be getting a puppy on her birthday – but after a muddle at the shelter, she welcomes Timir, a mischievous dragon, instead.

Elisabeth and the Box of Colours by Katherine Woodfine, illustrated by Rebecca Cobb (Barrington Stoke, £6.99)Élisabeth Louise Vigée le Brun was the portrait painter to Marie Antoinette. Beautifully told in spare, resonant words, this account of her life is full of Cobb’s delightful images, contrasting the shadowy grey of boarding-school routine and crushing grief with the riotous colours of artistic expression. A transporting little tale for 7-plus. The Boy Whose Wishes Came True by Helen Rutter (Scholastic, £6.99)Archie’s mum is too sad to take care of him; his dad, focused on his new family, doesn’t seem to care; at school, he’s picked on by everyone except his friend Mouse. But when Archie bumps his head and his favourite footballer appears to grant him nine wishes, everything is about to change … A funny, sad and inspiring story for 8-plus, with an enormously likable and convincing young protagonist. Loki: A Bad God’s Guide to Being Good by Louie Stowell (Walker, £7.99)Ideal for 9-plus, this outrageously funny illustrated diary chronicles the complaints of the Trickster God, exiled to Earth in a schoolboy’s body and given a month to redeem himself by showing “moral improvement”. That won’t be easy for a cunning and incredibly snarky Norse deity, who is thousands of years old and clearly shouldn’t have a bedtime. Sharp wit, ethical dilemmas, sly mythological references and oodles of doodles are a recipe for the purest reading pleasure. Like a Charm by Elle McNicoll (Knights Of, £6.99)Ramya is one of the few who can see the magical creatures filling Edinburgh’s streets. When her beloved grandfather dies, however, he leaves her a book with a brief, cryptic warning: Beware the Sirens. Another fiercely gripping, superbly original story from McNicoll, asking again why neurodivergent people (Ramya is dyspraxic) should be judged by the rigid standards of a neurotypical world. Mark My Words by Muhammad Khan (Macmillan, £7.99)When her school merges with affluent Minerva College, ambitious Dua Iqbal is furious to be denied a place on the prestigious Minerva Chronicle. When she starts a rival paper, though, she and her student journalists uncover alarming stories about drugs that those in authority would prefer to remain buried. Khan’s writing is occasionally overemphatic, but his dynamic heroine’s determination to speak truth to power at whatever cost makes for a compelling YA thriller. Kemosha of the Caribbean by Alex Wheatle (Andersen, £7.99)Kemosha was born into slavery – but when she is sold away from her brother to work in Port Royal, a lucky chance changes her fate. Learning swordfighting from the charismatic Ravenhide, she signs on as a ship’s cook with the notorious Captain Morgan. Will she ever earn enough to buy her brother’s freedom?

2/25/2022,"Orford Ness is a narrow shingle and marsh spit off the Suffolk coastline that “speaks gull, speaks wave, speaks bracken & lapwing, speaks bullet, ruin, gale, deception”. Now a nature reserve, it was previously the site of secret military activity from the first world war onwards, and retains the squat concrete structures that were used for military testing during the cold war. Narrated with great seriousness and portent by actor Stephen Dillane, Ness – a collaboration between nature writer Robert Macfarlane and artist Stanley Donwood – is a wonderfully weird prose poem and ecological parable in which a group of scientists including the Armourer, the Physicist, the Engineer and the Ornithologist gather at the decaying concrete Green Chapel. There they sing a hymn of ruination called “The Firing Song” and plot the end of the world. Meanwhile, five natural forces called “it”, “he”, “she”, “they” and “us” converge on the chapel to reclaim the land and avert catastrophe. “She” comprises lichen, moss and fungi; “it” is drift, with plastic bones and a body of pallet slat and bottle tops held together with fishing line. Listeners of Ness will miss out on Donwood’s eerie pen-and-ink drawings, but they gain a gently sinister score courtesy of composer Hugh Brunt, recorded at London’s Abbey Road studios. With its mythical atmosphere and rhythmic pleas to “Listen to the pasts of Ness. Listen inland to the long-gone wood, which rings with the cries of wildcat & brock, heorte & hind, doe & bocke”, this is a work that is best heard out loud.

2/25/2022,"On a bright, lunchtime drive to Haywards in Epping, I thought how, over recent years, Essex has transformed as a lifestyle concept. Essex folk doing “Essexy” things – winebars, brunch, nail appointments, wearing leather leggings – is the winning formula for multiple award-winning TV shows. Rarely, however, do we see Essex’s fancier fine-dining side, which is a shame as the county excels at fantastic, old-school, multi-course, finesse-in-heaps hospitality, with places such as Dunmow, Dedham, Chatham Green and Bell Common all being destination dining spots for earnest foodie types. Essex hospitality’s bigger problem, of course, is it’s just too darn close to Soho, where the fine-dining scene transmogrifies weekly, overshadowing the likes of chef Jahdre Hayward, his wife Amanda and his small, friendly team. This is a great shame, because since Haywards opened in 2013, people who love a good lunch have pointed me there, talking of a renovated coach house and skittle alley, close to a 17th century pub, serving ornate plates of venison with parsnip and quince or fig with Pedro Ximénez souffle. During the grimmest days of the pandemic, I wondered if independents like Haywards could remain afloat, so it was pleasing to enter its dining room of a Friday noon and be reminded how many ladies who like a three-course lunch live in the environs of Epping Forest, because it was fizzing with the kind of gossip about errant grandchildren and neighbourhood disputes that makes me want to pull up a chair and say things like: “She didn’t?” and “Not with those ankles”. Stylewise, Haywards felt, and I mean this in the nicest sense, like being on the set of MasterChef: the Professionals – a pale room with strategic pops of tasteful marine blue, a wooden floor, single flowers in rectangular mini-vases, unframed aerial friezes of the countryside on the walls and a grey menu where the modern-European fine dining is revealed with scant clues as to how it may look; eg: “monkfish, leek, mussels”. On telly, this gives Jay Rayner and me the opportunity to explain airily how we expect the dish to look, only to be heroically wrong when our lunch finally bowls in. We opted for three courses from the small, yet meaningful à la carte, kicking off with a very good, fresh-from-the-oven sourdough loaf and a plentiful wodge of salted butter, plus a surprise of veloute of pumpkin and a crisp, aerated cod-skin cracker dotted with delicate taramasalata, perched on rocks. By this stage, I knew Haywards was a great choice. It may not be as throbbingly of-the-moment as the newest multi-million-pound London or Lake District venture, but it has assured, ambitious dishes, using stellar produce, served by warm-hearted ladies whose feet never seem to touch the floor. A starter of glorious cured mackerel arrived, skin glossy, flanked by puddles of mackerel tartare in a clear dashi broth, made pretty with radish. A starter of quail was both roast breast and confit leg with crisp skin, a poached quail egg arranged dreamily around heavenly artichoke puree and deeply moreish pickled mushrooms. Things only got brighter over mains with a beguiling plate of roast lamb rump, crisp belly and croquette of shank, with aubergine puree. Unusually for restaurants like this, Haywards offered a plentiful side dish filled with steamed carrots, baby potatoes and hispi cabbage, lest anyone grumble that they left hungry. Oh how I have quietly pined for a potato at some world-class restaurants. Not here. The hero dish was a roast loin of venison, with a homemade venison sausage surrounded by satellites of quince puree and shooting stars of roast artichoke. A further mini-saucepan of venison ragu appeared to spoon over the buttered baby potatoes and add to the fun. Having eshewed booze and drunk only quince and ginger fizz, I had the perfect right to order a souffle all to myself. Tired of souffle, tired of life, I say. There will never be a time anyone presents me with one of these wobbly, featherlight highlights of pudding architecture and I don’t react like the Queen if you show her a racehorse. “Souffle,” I will gasp, as I did when a cream-coloured fig-flavoured souffle with caramel quivered as it neared my table, bringing along its friend, fresh almond ice-cream. It was five spoons of ecstasy that will rule me out of ever wearing leather leggings – without having to be cut out of them two minutes later in a changing room – but it was absolutely worth it. Haywards wasn’t the coolest, newest or the most experimental place I ate at during that week, but it lives on in my memory as fantastic, and that makes all the difference.

2/25/2022,"UK airlines face higher fuel costs and longer journey times on flights to Asia and beyond after Russia banned British carriers from its airspace. The move came in swift response to Boris Johnson’s decision to ban Russian national carrier Aeroflot from landing in the UK as part of a range of new sanctions against Moscow. British Airways, the only UK airline flying to Moscow prior to the ban, said it was warning customers that some flights to destinations east of Russia would now take longer due to rerouting. BA usually operates three flights a week to the Russian capital but does not fly to any other destinations in Russia or Ukraine. The retaliatory move from Russia will increase already escalating jet fuel costs and pose more headaches for the national carrier’s long-haul services. A BA spokesperson said: “We apologise for the inconvenience but this is clearly a matter beyond our control. We are notifying customers on cancelled services and are offering a full refund. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely.” Virgin Atlantic said that the flight ban would increase flight times to India and Pakistan by up to an hour. The airline had decided from Thursday evening to avoid Russian airspace before Moscow’s edict confirming the ban. A spokesperson said: “We apologise for any inconvenience caused to customers by slightly longer flight times. “The safety and security of our customers and people always comes first and we’re monitoring the situation in Ukraine and Russia extremely carefully following the escalation of conflict, continuing to operate in full compliance with relevant safety regulators, authorities and governments.” The longer flight paths will affect four Virgin routes, between London Heathrow to Islamabad, Lahore and Delhi, and between Manchester and Islamabad. Virgin has not flown in Ukraine airspace since 2014, on its own risk assessments, above and beyond official guidance, and said it had further increased distances from the hostilities at the Russia-Ukraine border since December. All airlines remain acutely conscious of the fate of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine in 2014 by what investigators concluded was a Russian-made missile fired by pro-Moscow forces, killing all 298 people aboard. The US and the EU have yet to follow suit on any flight ban. Aeroflot currently operates as part of the SkyTeam alliance, and has codeshare flights in and out of the US with Delta. Wizz and Ryanair were the only airlines operating direct flights from Ukraine to the UK. All flights have been suspended. Wizz, the only airline with bases in Ukraine, was on Thursday trying to evacuate its remaining aircraft and crew from Kyiv and Lviv.",News/Business,Longer flight times after Russia bans UK airlines from airspace,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/russia-airspace-ban-uk-airlines-longer-flight-times-ukraine-sanctions
2/25/2022,"About 5,000 miles away from the violence in Ukraine, shock waves from Russia’s invasion are being felt in Taiwan. Until recently, Taiwan was considered to be one of the world’s most significant potential flashpoints for a multination war. It was heralded – albeit with some exaggeration – as “the most dangerous place on Earth”, under growing threat of invasion by Xi Jinping’s China, which considers the independently governed democracy to be a Chinese province. This week its people have watched their fears play out in eastern Europe, as Russian forces – ordered by Xi’s ally Vladimir Putin – attacked in the pre-dawn hours of Thursday. The invasion prompted solidarity from Taiwan. The government proclaimed it stood with Ukraine, and announced unspecified economic sanctions against Russia. “The principle of self-determination cannot be erased by brute force,” said Taiwan’s vice-president, Lai Ching-te. It also prompted fear. There is speculation about whether Beijing might use this crisis to make its move, while the world is focused on Ukraine. “China may think about using military action against Taiwan at any moment,” Taiwan’s foreign minister, Joseph Wu, said earlier this month. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, warned “the shock will echo around the world” if Ukraine was endangered, specifically citing Taiwan. On Thursday, Beijing sent nine warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence zone – a slightly larger than average sortie among the near daily incursions of the last two years. On Wednesday, President Tsai Ing-wen ordered Taiwan’s military and national security apparatus to boost its defences, surveillance, and early warning systems, and to strengthen its already sophisticated responses to cognitive warfare. Analysts and China watchers say it is unlikely an attack is imminent. This year is politically sensitive for Xi with a once-in-five-years leadership congress, and Taiwan is both more easily defended than Ukraine and more important – strategically and economically – to world powers such as the US. “The Chinese leadership continues to emphasise that time is on China’s side for cross strait [unification], that trends are favouring China,” says Brookings Institute scholar on China and Asia, Ryan Hass. “That’s an alibi for maintaining the status quo throughout a turbulent year.” But J Michael Cole, a Taiwan-based China expert, warns there is a danger in assuming autocratic leaders like Putin and Xi are making decisions rationally. “The unimaginable is possible, even if, from our perspective, taking action, in this case launching a war of choice despite the threat of major sanctions, seems irrational.” In Taiwan feelings are mixed. The crisis has raised questions about Taiwan’s preparedness and the commitment of its friends. The threat of invasion has loomed for decades, but when the day comes Taiwan will need help to survive, and so people are watching closely how the international community is responding to Ukraine. In the bustle of a Taipei morning market, women are flitting from stall to stall, filling their trolley bags with produce, while sellers shout across the lanes to each other. Bebe, a fruit and vegetable seller, is unloading bags of cabbages from a blue truck onto her bicycle. It is a busy day before the long weekend, but Ukraine is at the top of her mind. “I’m really concerned about it,” she says from behind a wide straw hat and a face mask bearing the flags of Taiwan, the US, Lithuania, and Japan, with the message: “Thank you my friends.” “I don’t know if the US is strong enough to help protect Ukraine, so of course I worry about Taiwan.” Lannie, a 20-year-old student, says she fears that China appears to be helping Russia, and that could mean Russia helps China later on. “I don’t think we will have war today, but now I see everything happening I’m a little bit worried.” The moment is a litmus test for the US, several analysts say. “If the US is perceived as indecisive or incoherent or otherwise indifferent to western Europe’s concern about Russia, then that may diminish western Europe’s intention and willingness to help the US in the Indo-Pacific theatre as well,” says Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University. Several analysts argue that this week is a wake-up call for all western governments that have been strong on the rhetoric about Taiwan but haven’t yet really had to act. “International volatility is compelling countries to speak out more clearly about the importance they attach to Taiwan security,” says Hass. “To a certain extent events are providing a bit of a catalyst for coordination.” Online, many Taiwanese commenters fear those governments have already shown how far they are willing to go, and it is not enough. “I just hope that the president will strengthen Taiwan’s national defence,” wrote one person on Tsai’s Facebook page. “[In Ukraine] many big countries have done nothing at all except for sanctioning and praying! These countries are unreliable.” Taiwan’s military is no match for China’s despite billions of dollars in arms purchases from the US. Civilian urban warfare training programmes, similar to those that Ukrainians were filmed practising this week, are still in pilot mode. On Taiwan’s north-east coast in Yilan, a Ukrainian restaurant owner, Sergei Balagov, is watching the invasion of his home from afar. Balagov’s family are still there: a nephew is in Kharkiv, one of the first cities targeted, an uncle and aunt elsewhere in Ukraine. His brother is in Russia. “People are ready to meet the invaders,” he says just hours before Russian missiles hit Ukraine. He fears Taiwan’s people are not. “My feeling is the situation will change drastically in their mind if there are invaders stepping on their country and try to force their will,” he says. “But they need to be more able to fight. Right now … they are quite laid back.” Recent polling tends to support his concern. A survey taken just prior to the invasion showed more than half of respondents did not fear a war over Ukraine, and 63% did not think Xi would use the distraction to move on Taiwan. Cole says the crisis could make the threat of war less abstract to the Taiwanese public, and the government should use it to push for a viable reserve force and to encourage citizens to “perhaps dedicate a few weeks/months of their time learning skills that would come in handy in time of emergency”. Bebe believes it is up to Taiwan to defend itself. “Don’t depend on other nations,” she says, putting her faith in “a strong president” and the will of the people “to protect our country”. “Taiwan is not China. Absolutely not. That’s very important.”",News/World news,‘Of course I worry’: shock waves from Ukraine reach Taiwan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/of-course-i-worry-shockwaves-from-ukraine-reach-taiwan
2/25/2022,"Recently appointed associate artist with the London Symphony Orchestra, soprano-conductor Barbara Hannigan has made much of her dual role, often singing and conducting simultaneously, with uneven results, both live and on disc. Her latest venture, first unveiled in Paris in January last year, juxtaposes Strauss’s Metamorphosen with a multimedia version of La Voix Humaine, Poulenc’s one-act opera depicting the final phone conversation between a desperate woman, Elle (“She”), and the unseen lover who is dumping her for someone else. Her take on the work is idiosyncratic. At several points, Elle admits to lying, and Hannigan, in a video talk before her performance, posits the idea that the opera itself is a lie, arguing that Elle’s lover doesn’t really exist, and that “all this is a fantasy in her mind”. She notes Elle’s need to control her world, much as she herself controls the orchestra. “Perhaps she imagines that she is me,” she tells us. Hannigan conducts and sings the opera largely with her back to us, while live footage of her face and torso, directed by Clemens Malinowski, is projected from multiple platform cameras on to a large screen behind the orchestra. Rhythmic gestures are dramatically integrated as she pounds the air in fury at a crossed line on her now nonexistent phone, or claws her face in self-pity. Though she is amplified, the role suits her well vocally, and there is plenty of the underlying orchestral sensuality that Poulenc demanded. Yet it remains misguided. Conducting yourself on film seems quite literally self-regarding, I’m afraid. And if Elle’s lover doesn’t exist then Poulenc’s heroine becomes a delusional narcissist, which plays havoc with the balance of sympathies. Video was also promised for Metamorphosen, but didn’t, for whatever reason, materialise. Strauss’s great lament for the collapse of European culture in the last days of the second world war needs no visual accompaniment, and in this instance gained terrible resonance from being played on the day of the invasion of Ukraine. The performance, though, was overly restrained and understated, rarely attaining the harrowing immediacy the work ideally needs, which was a shame.",Arts/Music,LSO/Barbara Hannigan review – playing havoc with the balance of sympathies,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/25/lso-barbara-hannigan-review-barbican-london

Sean Dyche’s side seemed to have forgotten themselves but Wout Weghorst’s destruction of Brighton and a masterful 1-0 over an over-confident Tottenham has them back grinding for survival. A third successive win (last seen in April 2019) could incredibly move them out of danger. So can Crystal Palace survive an encounter with this reconfigured behemoth?

2/25/2022,"Slowly, we are returning to something resembling a pre-Covid state. In England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales at least, the final remaining restrictions have been lifted, or are likely to be lifted in the coming weeks. Offices are filling up, the queues at your chosen sandwich shop chain are getting longer, and for many the dreaded commute to work has returned. Which, in turn – for some of us – means the return of something else: the strange looks from other commuters as we try (and fail) not to laugh at podcasts. I felt that familiar rush of embarrassment earlier this week when, on The Always Sunny Podcast, Rob McElhenney recalled how, as a child, his mother would spray him with vinegar at the beach. I’m still not entirely sure why McElhenney’s mother sprayed him with vinegar on the beach – something to do with horseflies I think – but his description, and the comedic savaging he received from co-hosts Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day started me snorting. The Always Sunny Podcast is nominally a companion piece to It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, the long-running, much-loved sitcom starring McElhenney, Howerton and Day, as well as Kaitlin Olson and our lord Danny DeVito. I say nominally a companion piece: while each instalment of the pod is supposed to be a discussion on a corresponding episode of the sitcom – which, if you haven’t seen it follows the truly reprehensible owners of a decaying Irish pub in Philadelphia – the hosts usually abandon that premise a couple of minutes in to instead ramble about weird subjects, argue with each other, attempt bizarre impressions and generally try to make each other laugh. In fact, sometimes they don’t even bother to cover an episode of the show at all: last week they hosted a phone-in with members of the public, which not only managed to include a touching call with a woman who had recently undergone brain surgery, but also an eye-wateringly scatological convo with someone who was on the loo at the time. What’s particularly fun about the podcast, if you’re familiar with the show (I doubt the pod makes much sense if you aren’t, so it’s worth taking in the two in tandem), is how McElhenney, Howerton and Day resemble the mannerisms of their characters, without ever reaching the heights of their awfulness. The trio were friends before the pitched the sitcom to US network FX, and the podcast gives a glimpse into how they built the series from their own interactions: the bickering, the teasing, and the enjoyment of being in each other’s company. In short, The Always Sunny Podcast is fantastic, but it does present a bit of a problem on public transport. Do I just try to stifle a laugh? Or try to bury it in my sleeve as if I’m sneezing? Or do I just full-throatedly own the laughter, and risk the weird looks? Any advice from experienced comedy podcast commuters would be gratefully received!

2/25/2022,"Guardian Australia has won two Walkley awards for excellence in journalism for political editor Katharine Murphy’s commentary and reporter Naaman Zhou’s series on the dangers faced by food delivery drivers. Murphy took out the commentary, analysis, opinion and critique category for three of her columns on the gendered dynamics in federal parliament. In her article on former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins finding her voice after an alleged rape in Parliament House, Murphy argued the revelations about the incident needed to spark a moment of profound change. “This story, the gut-wrenching story of Higgins and the grotesque indignity she believes she suffered on a couch in the people’s house late at night – coming after a succession of stories about women struggling in a professional culture that remains institutionally hostile to women – has opened a wound in the building I’ve worked in for more than two decades,” Murphy wrote. “Women who work in politics to serve their country have had enough.” In early March, Murphy argued that the men in the halls of parliament were missing the moment – just as they had when Julia Gillard delivered her famous misogyny speech in 2012. Later that same month, in the wake of an interview with Scott Morrison on A Current Affair, she described how the prime minister was attempting to appeal to a particular cohort of women. “Perhaps for the foreseeable future Morrison’s prime ministership will now have two objectives: speaking to men who might vote Labor, and women inclined to pity unreconstructed men. Perhaps there was always some crossover with these two cohorts,” Murphy wrote. Samantha Maiden, the political editor of news.com.au, won the Gold Walkley for revealing allegations that Higgins had been raped in Parliament House. Reporter Naaman Zhou, who left Guardian Australia in 2021 to work at the New Yorker, won the all-media public service journalism Walkley for a series of reports on the dangers faced by food delivery drivers. In a feature in early November 2020, Zhou profiled three food delivery drivers who died while delivering meals for DoorDash, Hungry Panda and Uber Eats. In one case, the driver Chow Khai Shien’s death did not officially register in Australia for two and a half days. His follow-up news story in late November revealed that food delivery companies did not check whether their delivery riders had working bikes – or whether they could even ride a bike – before approving them to work. Zhou continued his coverage of the issue with a story in May last year, exposing the alarmingly low rates of pay Uber Eats riders in Australia were earning for long deliveries across multiple suburbs. Guardian Australia was a finalist in three other categories: Indigenous affairs, innovation and press photography.

2/25/2022,"The UK has said it will work “all day” to persuade fellow European states to cut Russia off from the international Swift payment system. The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, ended the pretence that Britain was not at odds with its fellow European leaders over the issue. He said there was still time for Russia to be excluded, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “The UK is working with allies to exclude Russia from the Swift financial system.” Wallace added: “We will work all the magic, do everything we can in diplomacy.” Truss is to undertake a round of shuttle diplomacy to try to rally support for the British position after the EU refused to adopt what has been billed as the “nuclear option” of sanctions. What is it? Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals. Who owns it? Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Why would a Swift ban be so serious? Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban? One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. British officials said that the EU, reflecting the divisions at its council meeting on Thursday, kept the Swift option on the table. UK diplomats are arguing that with Ukrainian forces mounting a defence of their country, and scattered signs of unease in Russian cities, this is the moment to try to get ahead of Putin for once and surprise him with a move that would send the Russian economy straight into the deep freeze. The British position has the support of Canada and some US senators. British officials insist they will keep up the pressure for the policy even if Kyiv falls. Boris Johnson lobbied the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, on Wednesday on the issue but made no progress. Johnson’s position, also raised at a virtual meeting of the G7, is backed by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer. The Swift payment system (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars’ worth of deals. Swift is incorporated under Belgian law and, although supervised by a complex web of central banks, it was forced in 2012 to comply with an EU regulation, as confirmed by its home country government, that had cut Iran off from the banking system. Wallace said: “We would like to go further. We’d like to do the Swift system – that is the financial system that allows the Russians to move money around the world to receive payments for its gas – but … these are international organisations and if not every country wants them to be thrown out of the Swift system, it becomes difficult.” Opponents of the move argue that it would incentivise Russia to try to use an alternative fledgling scheme. They also say it would be dangerous for countries highly dependent on Russia for their energy, principally Italy. The Biden administration privately supports the Swift cutoff, but is also focused on maintaining transatlantic unity. Biden highlighted the other swingeing sanctions that the EU had agreed to take, arguing that they were more effective than Swift. He said: “It is always an option, but right now that’s not the position the rest of Europe wishes to take.” Scholz said before an EU meeting to decide on sanctions late on Thursday night that it was important for the EU to hold measures in reserve to punish Russia further. “It’s very important that we decide on measures that have been prepared in recent weeks and reserve everything else for a situation where it is necessary to do other things as well,” he said. The former European Council president Donald Tusk said on Friday that some EU governments had “disgraced themselves” by refusing to impose the toughest possible sanctions on Russia even as Vladimir Putin was bombing Kyiv. The remarkable rebuke by Tusk, who led meetings of the council as president from 2014 to 2019, revealed deep divisions among Europe’s political elite at what is perhaps the continent’s most acute moment of crisis since the second world war. “In this war everything is real: Putin’s madness and cruelty, Ukrainian victims, bombs falling on Kyiv,” Tusk posted on Twitter. “Only your sanctions are pretended [sic]. Those EU governments which blocked tough decisions (i.a. Germany, Hungary, Italy) have disgraced themselves.”",News/World news,UK says it will work ‘all day’ to persuade Europe to cut Russia off from Swift,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/uk-says-it-will-work-all-day-to-persuade-europe-to-cut-russia-off-from-swift-ukraine
