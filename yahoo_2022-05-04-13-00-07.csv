5/4/2022,"Gen. John Raymond, chief of space operations for the U.S. Space Force, showed off the latest prototype of the service's dress uniform during a Senate hearing Tuesday. The new version features notable changes after critics roasted an earlier iteration last year. Raymond's well-tailored dress uniform, which he wore as he testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the service's proposed 2023 budget, is the latest version to be publicly displayed since the first was unveiled at the Air Force Association's Air, Space and Cyber Conference in September. Noteworthy changes on the uniform that Raymond sported include ""adding stripes down the pants, changing the pocket style, adding pockets on the lower half of the jacket, and decreasing the number of buttons on the interior enclosure of the jacket,"" Maj. Vicky Porto, a Department of the Air Force spokeswoman, said in an email. Read Next: 'Space Force' Is Now Official to the VA, but Not Everyone Is on the Same Page A Military.com reporter who saw Raymond exiting the hearing found the trousers to look reasonably tailored, although the addition of the stripes made the pants reminiscent of track suits. When the initial version of the uniform debuted at the Air Force Association's annual conference last year, critics took to social media to complain about its science fiction-inspired look and, particularly, how baggy the pants were. ""The new Space Force uniform ... A blend of the Star Trek Enterprise dress uniform, but with the Mirror Universe diagonal,"" Peter Singer, a noted commentator on the military and author of ""LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media,"" tweeted during last year's rollout. The criticism dominated the news cycle, and the Space Force promised to try again. ""We heard your feedback,"" the service tweeted shortly after the conference. ""New pants, new fit coming soon."" Porto told Military.com that, after the first prototype was unveiled, the Space Force did a three-month ""uniform roadshow"" and visited 10 bases to ""give Guardians the opportunity to see the uniform, ask questions, and provide feedback on the design."" Tracy Roan, chief of the Air Force Uniform Office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, helped spearhead a lot of the changes. ""We want to make sure that their fit is the best that it can be because it allows them to perform their job better,"" Roan told Military.com in February. ""It also provides comfort, and it makes them proud of the way that they look and represent the country."" One of the main criticisms of the original version was the tight-fitting collar, which has now been reworked to ""better frame the tie,"" Porto said in an email. In another change, the female version of the jacket was lengthened. One of the main focuses of the design process was to create unisex pieces, something Roan said can be welcoming to nonbinary service members. ""As we look at their new service dress, we're looking at, in particular, options of neckwear that females, in particular, would be able to wear a tie, like their male counterparts,"" she said. ""Especially if you're nonbinary, that you could wear a tie, and there's no relationship to either gender."" The pandemic has caused delays for the textile industry, pushing back the date the uniform will be available to the ranks. After the dress uniform is tested and finally approved, it likely won’t be available to all Guardians until 2025. In addition to developing the dress uniform, Roan said her office is starting to prototype maternity wear for Space Force Guardians. -- Thomas Novelly can be reached at thomas.novelly@military.com.

5/4/2022,"A Merced man who was building a unique-looking shelter in the side of a Bear Creek embankment was arrested this week, after police say his excavation activities may cost the city thousands of dollars. Merced Police Lt. Emily Foster said 39-year-old Hector Segura, was arrested by officers Friday afternoon. Police said they had been trying to arrest him for more than a week. Foster said the damage is located on the south side of Bear Creek between R Street and Pira Drive, near the Michael O Sullivan Bike Path. Police believe Segura was digging out dirt from along the creek embankment and building a shelter. Photos from the scene show Segura’s work looked quite extensive — with doorways and ground that looked like it had been leveled. Police said is appears Segura was taking that dirt and throwing it into the creek itself, in an attempt to build a bridge from one side to the other. Merced Public Works employees were in the area more than a week ago when they alerted authorities to the damage. “Where the damage is, is actually MID property,” Foster said. Police said Segura is homeless and appeared to be living in the area of the damage along the creek. It is unknown how long he had allegedly been digging out the dirt from the embankment. While Segura’s creation may look interesting, it can cause expensive problems for the city — and pose a public safety hazard. Foster said damaging the embankment in such a manner can lead to a sidewalk collapse, which can be dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists traveling along the creek. Police said similar events have occurred in other areas along the creek. According to Foster, Segura is the second person since the beginning of the year to be arrested for digging shelter into the side of Bear Creek. She said it could cost anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 to repair the damage caused to the embankment. “For those that are thinking about doing it, it’s going to cost you a trip to jail,” said Foster Segura was arrested on suspicion of two counts of felony vandalism, according to police. “With water levels coming up, we’re hoping that we’ll see it less,” said Foster. According to police, those who wish to report damage such as this can do so through the Merced Connect app or by calling the Merced Police Department non-emergency number at 209-385-6905.",U.S./Merced Sun-Star,A Merced man was digging a shelter in the side of a creek.

5/4/2022,"A Trump-supporting, anti-masker couple captured in a viral video spewing racist and homophobic abuse on a JetBlue flight on Sunday were kicked off the tarmac in Florida but were not charged, according to officials. The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office sent The Daily Beast an incident report Tuesday that said Madelein Kelly and her unidentified partner, both from New Jersey, were escorted off the JetBlue flight and out of the West Palm Beach Airport on Sunday afternoon. (Kelly, a former Broadway dancer, appears to spell her name as Madeleine.) In a video that made the rounds first on TikTok before being deleted and uploaded by a user on Reddit, a woman—Kelly—is seen having a heated discussion with a flight attendant. While it’s not clear what started the squabble, the clip begins with a Black flight attendant urging the woman to leave, and the woman telling him, “You don’t like the words coming out of my mouth. Free speech is dead!” The woman, who is sitting in the middle seat on the right side of the plane and is not wearing a face mask, vehemently insists that she and the unmasked man next to her didn’t do anything wrong. She refuses to get off the plane when the attendant suggests it. “Then, you’re going to have to take everyone off,” she tells the attendant. “This is ridiculous.” After the attendant walks away, the woman still berates him and the passengers sitting across the aisle, all of whom are wearing masks. “Do you guys see what’s happening in America? He didn’t like what we said, and now we’re getting kicked off the plane. And all of you all are going to have to wait. This is fucking outrageous. You guys, we’re going to turn into China—it’s coming,” she says. After making sheep sounds and calling other passengers sheep for wearing masks, the woman shouts, “I love Elon Musk. He is the best. Elon! He is the fucking king! The mask people in our row are kicking us off the plane.” She then points at each person around her, claiming she’s going to sue them, then threatens to sue the airline. People around her laugh. As a self-proclaimed former Broadway dancer, the woman brags that she has plenty of free time and won’t be getting vaccinated. The New York Times reported Kelly was the director-choreographer of the 2007 musical The Glorious Ones, in which the cast performed a number of sketch comedy gags onstage. She was a guest instructor at the Carolyn Dutra Dance Studio, according to the company’s Facebook page. After threatening to sue the airline, Kelly declares, “I’m not getting that fucking vaccine. We did nothing!” Despite sitting in coach, her partner boasts he has more money than the passengers sitting across the aisle. Delta Passenger Moons His Fellow Travelers in Insane Mask Meltdown Then, the woman directs the camera toward a masked man sitting in an aisle seat to her left, ranting, “You’re the reason we’re getting kicked off. Now, I got your face.” “Got your face, f—--t,” her partner chimes in. The couple vocally expresses their love for one another. The partner, who Kelly refers to as “Gene,” tells her he wants to get off the plane. But she’s not having it—even when security attempts to unbuckle the man. “I’m retired FBI,” the man claims. “I know my rights.” After security leaves, the woman exclaims to the rest of the plane that it’s their anniversary. Meanwhile, “Gene” shouts homophobic slurs at passengers and crosses his arms in toddler-like fashion to prevent security from moving him. Eventually, the pilot makes an announcement that the entire plane has to get off and re-board due to a couple of passengers not cooperating with crew members. Southwest Passenger Arrested for Masturbating FOUR Times During Flight “What did we do?” the woman keeps shouting. “You make me sick,” the man identified as “Gene” says to another passenger. “We gotta get off the plane because we’re Trump supporters,” the woman rants. “I think that’s what it is.” In another video from another user uploaded on Vimeo, people boo as the couple are escorted through the airport with security. The woman attempts to yell back at everyone, but security stops her and keeps her moving. According to the Palm Beach incident report, the couple were not charged with any offenses and were led out of the airport where they waited for a ride to pick them up.
