1/19/2022,"Los Angeles officials are offering a reward of more than $200,000 for information leading to the arrest of a man suspected of fatally stabbing a 24-year-old UCLA graduate student while she worked alone at a furniture store. Brianna Kupfer was found dead on the floor of the store by a customer on Thursday not long after she had sent an ominous text message to a friend, police said. Police say Kupfer was the only employee at Croft House on La Brea Avenue when someone came into the store last Thursday afternoon and fatally stabbed her. CBS Los Angeles reports that on Tuesday night, police identified the suspect as Shawn Laval Smith. He is still at large and is considered armed and dangerous. Officers said Kupfer instantly had a bad feeling when the suspect walked into the store. ""She sent a text to a friend saying there was someone inside the location that gave her a bad vibe. Regrettably, that person did not see the text immediately,"" said Lt. John Radtke of LAPD. About 15 minutes later, a customer found Kupfer stabbed to death, police said. ""I don't see us healing anytime soon,"" Todd Kupfer, the victim's father, told CBS Los Angeles. ""I would love to tell you that there's going to be a point we're going to be better, but I feel like it's going to be a big missing piece."" Brianna Kupfer graduated from both Brentwood High School and the University of Miami, before returning to Southern California to pursue an architectural design degree from UCLA, CBS Los Angeles reported. Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz asked city leaders Tuesday to add $50,000 to the more than $200,000 reward for information leading to the capture and conviction of the suspect. ""We will find this vicious criminal, we will arrest him and we will get him prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Koretz said. Police released video Tuesday from a 7-Eleven store, showing the suspect shopping 30 minutes after Kupfer was fatally stabbed. He was also shopping at other stores before and after the killing, police said. DO YOU KNOW HIM?

1/19/2022,"New York Attorney General Letitia James took legal action Tuesday night to compel former President Donald Trump and two of his children, Donald Jr. and Ivanka, to appear for sworn testimony as part of her office's ongoing civil investigation of the Trump Organization's financial dealings. James had subpoenaed Trump in December and Don Jr. and Ivanka earlier in January, and Tuesday's motion was in opposition to attempts by the Trumps to quash those subpoenas. ""Thus far in our investigation, we have uncovered significant evidence that suggests Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization falsely and fraudulently valued multiple assets and misrepresented those values to financial institutions for economic benefit,"" James said in a statement. ""The Trumps must comply with our lawful subpoenas for documents and testimony because no one in this country can pick and choose if and how the law applies to them."" The office of the attorney general's (OAG) new filings includes several news fraud allegations, including that Ivanka Trump held an option to purchase an apartment in the wildly overvalued Trump Park Avenue building for $8.5 million, though Trump's financial statements valued it as high as $25 million. And Trump claimed on multiple financial statements that his gilded Trump Tower triplex, assessed at $127 million, was valued at $327 million, ""based on the apartment having 30,000 square feet of space multiplied by a certain price per square foot,"" the attorney general's office said. ""However, the actual size of Mr. Trump's triplex apartment was 10,996 square feet, and documents confirming that fact were signed by Mr. Trump himself in 2012,"" the report states. ""In testimony to OAG, Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg admitted that the value of Mr. Trump's apartment was overstated by 'give or take' $200 million."" ""As the papers filed today make clear,"" each of the three Trumps ""was directly involved in one or more transactions under review,"" James' press release says. ""While OAG has not yet reached a final decision regarding whether this evidence merits legal action, the grounds for pursuing the investigation are self-evident."" The chances that James eventually pursues legal action are ""pretty high,"" a source familiar with the investigation tells Rolling Stone. ""The key thing here is this new information demonstrates that Trump and his family are personally implicated in this fraud.""

1/19/2022,"China forcefully retrieved around 10,000 fugitives from overseas in the last decade, a report says. NGO Safeguard Defenders said Beijing has been sending agents overseas to illegally intimidate targets. Its report on ""Operation Sky Net"" shows the extent of China's clandestine operations in other countries. A new report published by a human rights NGO has detailed the methods used by China to force thousands of fugitives to return from other countries, describing the extent of Beijing's operations on foreign soil to control the Chinese diaspora. Spain-based NGO Safeguard Defenders highlighted three tactics sanctioned by China for this purpose — detaining the fugitive's relatives as a threat, sending agents overseas to illegally intimidate the person in question, or outright kidnapping them. The organization compiled information related to 62 of these cases in countries including the US, Canada, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. Official data from China suggests nearly 10,000 fugitives have been returned since 2014 under a program codenamed ""Operation Sky Net"" or ""Tian Wang,"" Safeguard Defenders noted. In 2020 alone, 1,421 fugitives were extradited to China by Sky Net, Chinese state media reported, touting the operation as an anti-graft campaign. When Sky Net was launched in 2015, it absorbed a more well-known repatriation operation called Fox Hunt, which was lauded by state media and reported on extensively by Western news. In its 69-page report, Safeguard Defenders described case studies in which Chinese agents flew to the US to intimidate their targets into returning to the mainland. Chinese authorities hired American private eyes to work with their ground teams — as detailed in the example of a former New York police officer who aided an extradition operation from 2017 to 2019. That way, they would avoid having too many Chinese agents on the field, the NGO said. Alternatively, the authorities would detain the families of fugitives in an attempt to coerce relatives to ask the target to return, said Safeguard Defenders. For example, a Chinese-born US permanent resident detained in Dubai last May recounted how his parents were repeatedly harassed by police and detained multiple times. He fell out of Beijing's graces when he went on social media to question China's actual death toll from a border clash with India. He did not return to China and said he had completely lost contact with his parents. The NGO noted that one of the groups most heavily targeted by this Sky Net strategy is Uyghurs, a Muslim minority whose treatment by China has been the subject of international scrutiny. The group also employs kidnapping. Safeguard Defenders cited reports and footage of exiled activists and business magnates being abducted in public areas, hotels, and even their homes in countries like Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United Arab Emirates. The NGO further noted an increasing trend of China working with local law enforcement in the fugitive's host country, such as Egyptian police arresting and deporting Uyghurs in joint operations with Beijing. In a similar case, Safeguard Defenders interviewed an activist helping the son of a human rights lawyer escape China into Myanmar. According to the man's account, they were followed into Myanmar and captured by plainclothes Chinese agents. They were then interrogated and brought back to China. The Burmese government said it had no knowledge of such events. ""With involuntary returns, the CCP's message is that nowhere is safe; fleeing overseas will not save you, there is no escape,"" wrote the authors of the report.

1/19/2022,"The New York attorney general alleged value inflation by Trump's business in new filings. An apartment was valued at $25 million, documents say, but offered to Ivanka Trump for $8 million. Donald Trump has long denied any wrongdoing, and claims the investigation is politically motivated. An apartment leased by Ivanka Trump from the Trump Organization was given a sky-high public valuation but offered to her for far less, new legal documents allege. The Park Avenue property was said publicly to be worth $25 million, but Ivanka retained an option to buy it for $8 million, per a slew of legal filings from the New York Attorney General. They are part of a wider case against the Trump Organization alleging that the company may have illegally manipulated the value of its assets for its own gain. In legal documents filed Tuesday night, staff for New York Attorney General Letitia James presented what they said was evidence of possible value inflation. Among the properties identified in the documents is Trump Park Avenue, a luxury apartment complex in Manhattan. According to the documents, the Trump Organization in financial statements between 2011 and 2020 said the entire property was worth between $135 million and $350 million, with unsold residential condominiums representing around 95% of the value. But, according to James, evidence indicates that the real value of the properties was boosted as part of a scheme to secure financial gain, involving several other Trump assets. ""Evidence obtained by OAG indicates both that the reported values of the unsold residential units of the Trump Park Avenue building were significantly higher than the internal valuations used by the Trump Organization for business planning and failed to account for the fact that many units were rent stabilized,"" said James in a press release. One apartment, per the press release, was one leased by Ivanka Trump, who is also a Trump Organization executive, and was a White House advisor during his presidency. According to the statement, Ivanka Trump was given the option to buy the apartment for $8.5 million even though it was valued at $25 million in Trump's financial statements. This, James alleged, highlighted the discrepancy between what the company was claiming the apartment was worth and its true value. The complex is one of several Trump properties and businesses mentioned in the documents. Others include his Trump Tower apartment, golf club in Westchester, New Jersey, and golf club near Aberdeen, Scotland. Evidence indicates that the values of those were also inflated, according to the attorney general's office. In the documents, James' office says that it ""has not yet reached a final decision regarding whether this evidence merits legal action."" Attorneys representing Donald Trump, the Trump Organization, and Ivanka Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the claims. Trump has long denied any wrongdoing, and has claimed that James, a Democrat, is motivated by political hostility towards him. The release of the lawsuit comes after Trump sought to quash a series of subpoenas issued by the New York attorney general seeking testimony from him, his son Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka. The investigation is being conducted alongside a parallel criminal investigation by Manhattan Attorney General Alvin Bragg.

1/19/2022,"San Francisco 49ers Nick Bosa says he has the lowest body fat percentage on his whole team. Bosa says his high-protein diet that emphasizes lean fish and chicken is the reason why. Other sports stars like Tom Brady and Kevin Love have also spoken about the benefits of a fish-heavy diet. San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa said he has the lowest body fat percentage on his team, and he believes his new high-protein diet is the reason for it. Speaking during an interview with NFL Network, the 24-year-old Pro Bowl defensive end said every player on his team underwent a Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan this offseason, which measures body mass index and how much of a person's mass is fat and how much is muscle. His body fat percentage was the lowest on the team. For perspective: Bosa is on the same team as slender wide receiver Travis Benjamin, who is almost 100 lbs lighter at 175 lbs, and yet has a higher body fat percentage. Bosa, who weighs 266 lbs, plays a position on the defensive line that is conventionally known to have bulkier players who embrace weight as an advantage against opponents, and are not typically seen as lean. In Bosa's case, more of his weight comes from muscle. Bosa believes his lean physique — with a body fat percentage of 3% when he was checked in August, according to NBC Sports Bay Area — has translated to results this season. He racked up 15.5 sacks compared to just nine total in his first two seasons, and made his second Pro Bowl. Bosa says he got particularly lean after taking up a strict, protein-heavy diet this year — part of his recovery from a season-ending ACL injury early in the 2020 season. During his rehab, he hired a private chef to help get his body back to the best physical level. ""I've got an amazing chef, Chef Anna, shout out. She'll come in two days a week and cook for almost the whole week,"" Bosa said. ""There's a really good fish market right near my house so she gets fresh fish from there. There's poke, ceviche, delicious fish, chicken, steak, and then the salad she makes to accompany them are top-notch."" Following a high-protein diet is an effective way to reduce body fat and build lean muscle, especially when following a diet like Bosa's which is heavy on lean protein and vegetables. Insider reporter Rachel Hosie cut her body fat percentage in half by following a high-protein diet over the course of six months, as sh Bosa's high-protein, low-carb diet is also not unlike other stars in the NFL and other sports who follow strict lifestyles to maintain high performance. Tom Brady, 44, follows a diet that includes high-protein smoothies and main dishes made up of 20% lean protein and 80% vegetables, according to his wellness program TB12. NBA star Kevin Love, 33, told Insider that his main source of protein is fatty fish, which helps him avoid injury and maintain energy as an aging player. Fellow NFL defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh, 35, told GQ that he follows a high-protein, low-carb diet with a lot of vegetables that is similar to Bosa's. Suh's strict lifestyle which has helped him avoid injuries throughout his entire NFL career at 315 lbs and continue to play at a high level in his late 30s.

1/19/2022,"Data: Our World in Data; Chart: Baidi Wang/Axios The Omicron wave is likely beginning to recede in the U.S., experts say. Why it matters: Omicron is still wreaking havoc in parts of the country, but infectious disease experts are optimistic that relief is around the corner. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free Details: In South Africa and in the U.K., which experienced their Omicron waves before the U.S., cases spiked dramatically and then fell almost as quickly. That appears to be happening now in parts of the U.S. that got hit with the variant early, including Boston, New York and Washington, D.C. ""The trajectory was incredibly steep and rising to, of course, a new height in infections. That does appear now, in aggregate, to be starting to decline,"" Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Axios. Yes, but: While cases are beginning to fall in the East Coast cities that were among the first to see the variant take hold, Omicron likely hasn't peaked yet in other parts of the U.S. ""In this country as a whole, it might take a while longer to resolve this surge,"" in comparison to South Africa or the U.K., Dan Barouch, director of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, told Axios. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned over the weekend that a ""national peak"" hasn't been reached yet, urging caution as hospitalizations continue to strain health systems, the Washington Post reported. What's next: Even though Omicron seems to cause milder illness than prior variants, it has still strained hospitals' resources, and the virus has continued to kill more than 1,000 people per day, on average. The U.S. surpassed 850,000 total COVID deaths according to data released over the weekend, just one month after recording 800,000 deaths related to the virus. ""Unfortunately, the 'loss of life peak' is still ahead of us and we're probably going to see that in the next week, or two,"" Beyrer said. Yes, but: The U.S. does seem to be largely tracking with the projections from South Africa with this variant, Bob Wachter, chairman of the University of California, San Francisco Department of Medicine, told Axios. If there is no variant right behind Omicron, we could be in for a ""fairly benign period where it will be appropriate to live life more normally"" this spring, he said. ""It really does feel like the building blocks of a conversion from pandemic to endemic are all there,"" Wachter said. But, he said, ""over the past two years, if we've learned nothing else, it's that this virus surprises us and there are always the possibility of new factors and curveballs."" Like this article?

1/19/2022,"Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) appeared on Anderson Cooper 360, Tuesday, where he addressed the growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as Russia now reportedly has hundreds of thousands of troops posted at the Ukrainian border. Though Russia invaded Crimea, a pro-Russia area of Ukraine, in 2014 with little push-back, Murphy said things would go much differently if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to invade. “There is going to be continued U.S. assistance, assistance to an army that’s ready to fight and a population that is not just going to let Russia march into the center of Ukraine,” Murphy said. “Putin seems to be getting absolutely horrible advice. People telling him he is going to be greeted as some kind of liberator in a country that has turned against Russia over the last 10 years and is going to fight for its survival.” Murphy said that feelings in Ukraine have changed in recent years, with 60 to 70 percent of citizens now in favor of joining NATO, exactly what Putin is trying to stop from happening. But Murphy believes Putin would be making a terrible mistake if he decides to invade Ukraine, a decision that could be catastrophic for Russia. Murphy equated it to Russia’s failed invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. “This, to me, would be the biggest mistake of Vladimir Putin's career. He will get bogged down inside Ukraine just like his predecessors got bogged down in Afghanistan in 1980 and 1981,” Murphy said. “Ukrainians are gonna fight for their lives. There will be a long-term counterinsurgency. It will be bloody, it will be drawn out, and it will be a black mark on Russia that could end up leading to Russia’s downfall, as the Afghanistan invasion arguably contributed to the Soviet Union’s downfall.” While the U.S. and some NATO allies are providing support for the Ukrainian military in the form of weapons and training, there may also be sanctions coming for Putin if Russia invades Ukraine, adding to the financial cost on top of the human cost of an invasion. Despite Russia’s warning, a new sanctions bill was recently introduced, and Murphy said that sanctions from multiple countries are on the table. “My sense is that the British have been with us from the beginning and that other European allies are coming along to our view,” Murphy said, “and are now finally willing to, sort of, put up a set of potential sanctions that may ultimately be dispositive in convincing Putin that it's just not worth it.” Anderson Cooper 360 airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on CNN. Check out Michelle Obama's inspiring advice to college students for dealing with fear: As Michelle Obama celebrated her 58th birthday Monday, BET aired a special called Becoming: Michelle Obama in Conversation, during which the former first lady sat down with actress Yara Shahidi as well as a group of college students for a heart-to-heart conversation to discuss themes from her bestselling memoir such as mental health, diversity and inclusion. Not surprisingly, Michelle had a lot of great advice, particularly when it comes to fear.
After one student asked her, ""What would you say to Black girls who are stuck in that small space? And how would you encourage them to grow as the world around them gets bigger and bigger?"" Obama shared, ""Fear is this wonderful concept, right? It's very useful, right? Especially if you grow up in the hood, you need a little fear just to get through the day, you need to be looking over your shoulder, you know, fear keeps you alive in a lot of instances, right? Keeps you safe. But also, fear can keep you stuck, right?""
""My advice for people, what allowed me to step outside of my small, six-block area, it was practicing pushing through that fear,"" continued Obama. ""Practicing transition. Practicing facing that precipice, that thing you feel in your stomach, that thing in your brain that tells you to hold back when your heart and soul tells you to go ahead, and you're right at the corner of that.""
While discussing pushing through fear, Michelle also recalled the moment Barack came to her with a big idea.
""Treat fear as a challenge, you know? As a muscle. Breaking it is a muscle that you need to develop, right? And that's how, shoot, my husband coming to me, saying, 'I'm gonna run for President, how do you feel about that?' My logical mind said, 'No! No, no, no, no, no, I am very afraid of all of this.' But I had all this practice over my lifetime of jumping over hurdles and using those tools that got me over to say, 'I can do this. I can do this with you. I can do this and keep my children safe. I can do this and be a use to the country, so let's go for it. And if I had said no, I wouldn't be here today, you know? There's a lot of good stuff on the other side of fear, if you, you know, if you learn how to maneuver it.""
