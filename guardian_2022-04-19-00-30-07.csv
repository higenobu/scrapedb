4/19/2022,"A Ukrainian family in war-torn Kharkiv is racing against the clock to get six newborn puppies to safety as bombs continue to rain down on the city. The family, who have asked not to be named because of the growing danger in Ukraine’s second city, adopted a heavily pregnant dog they found wandering in the ruins of Kharkiv in the middle of March. The mother said: “I like animals a lot. Of course, I saw that she was pregnant, this just played a major role. I couldn’t let her give birth on the street. When she came to us the temperature was -10C [14F]. We took her home and she gave birth three days later.” The litter of six puppies was born on 16 March. While food supplies in the city are uncertain and more buildings are being destroyed by Russian bombs the family are sharing their home and their food with the seven canine guests. The family live in a suburb of Kharkiv where shelling continues to be particularly heavy. The mother hopes a way can be found to safely evacuate the puppies and resettle them in loving and peaceful homes in the UK or elsewhere. The family will be unable to keep them for much longer because they are all growing fast. UK-based Ukrainian academic Nataliya Rumyantseva is trying to do everything she can to help. She is in contact with the family and is researching ways to help get the puppies to safety. She said she was particularly struck by the juxtaposition of the kindness and generosity of the family under siege from Russian bombs doing what they can under the most difficult circumstances to nurture new life while the shelling is killing so many in the city and elsewhere in Ukraine. “It is an amazing example of compassion and generosity of spirit the way this family opened their hearts to the dog and her puppies when they themselves have very little to live on,” she said. “New life, whether in animals or people, is a source of joy. I admire this family’s stamina to give these new lives a chance. “At the same time my heart bleeds for all the babies and children, the inspiration for human innocence, who have died or been injured in the war to date.” Many Ukrainians are fleeing their country with their pets and more than a million are thought to have fled to neighbouring countries with their pets. But depending on the vaccination status of the animal the process of bringing a Ukrainian pet to the UK may be neither quick nor straightforward. Defra has suspended the commercial importation of dogs, cats and ferrets to 41 May if the animals originate from or have been dispatched from Ukraine, Belarus, Poland or Romania. This includes rescue animals. The suspension does not apply to these pets defined as “non-commercial”. The department said the reason for this was because of the serious health risks posed by animals whose owners had not fully complied with health and documentation requirements. Defra has admitted that quarantine space in the UK is limited but says Ukrainian pets will be prioritised. The Animal and Plant Health Agency is endeavouring to provide quick approvals for these pets to come to the UK. The government is covering quarantine costs and new blood tests to detect rabies vaccinations will reduce quarantine time. The government is also covering the cost of vaccinations and microchipping for Ukrainian pets. Defra reported that one shipment of 19 animals imported by a rescue charity travelled illegally on falsified rabies documentation, something that “presents serious risks to biosecurity and public health”.",News/World news,Kharkiv family races to get six newborn puppies out of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/kharkiv-family-races-to-get-six-newborn-puppies-out-of-ukraine
4/19/2022,"Manchester United are set to announce Erik ten Hag as their new permanent manager once the terms of his €2m release clause from Ajax are finalised in the coming days. Negotiations over the length of the Dutchman’s deal are continuing as United close in on appointing a successor to Ole Gunnar Solskjær, with Ten Hag expected to commit either to an initial three years plus the option of another 12 months or a four-year contract lasting until 2026. It is understood that Ten Hag has been granted a key demand: to be allowed the final decision on transfers together with the club executive due to his determination that the mistakes in the market that have marred the nine years of the post-Sir AlexFerguson era should not be repeated. While official confirmation should not come until after United’s match at Liverpool on Tuesday evening, the current Ajax coach is expected to hold talks over bringing his No 2 at the Dutch club, Mitchell Van der Gaag, to be his assistant while discussions regarding Steve McClaren also forming part of his backroom staff continue. United, who wish to be respectful of Ajax, will be in direct contact this week regarding Ten Hag’s release clause. Ajax were beaten 2-1 by PSV Eindhoven in the KNVB Cup final on Sunday. Once the payment details of this are agreed, his confirmation as United’s fifth manager in less than a decade since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to be confirmed.",Sport/Football,Manchester United set to confirm Erik ten Hag as new manager in coming days,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/18/manchester-united-set-to-confirm-erik-ten-hag-as-new-manager-in-coming-days

The family said its wait for justice continues as vigils were held in Belfast and Derry on Monday to pay tribute to McKee, who was shot while observing a riot in Derry on 18 April 2019. The Police Service of Northern Ireland also appealed for fresh information. Nine people have been charged in relation to the shooting, six of them with public order offences and three with murder. There have been no convictions. The New IRA, a dissident republican group, admitted responsibility soon after the shooting and apologised, saying its gunman had been aiming at police.

4/19/2022,"The World Bank is preparing a $170bn package of financial help in response to the overlapping global crises of war, pandemic and inflation that are hitting the poorest countries particularly hard, its president has said. David Malpass warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had added to pressures caused by the Covid-19 crisis and soaring cost of living, and there was a need to provide assistance quickly. Under proposals that will be discussed with the World Bank’s member governments at this week’s spring meeting of the Washington-based organisation, $50bn would be spent over the next three months, with a further $120bn of financing provided over the following year. “I’m deeply concerned about developing countries,” Malpass told reporters. “They are facing sudden price increases for energy, fertiliser, and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.” The World Bank president said dearer food and energy, higher interest rates, the war in Ukraine and China’s coronavirus-related shutdowns meant the global economy was now expected to grow by 3.2% this year, compared with the 4.1% it had predicted in January. The Bank’s sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund, will downgrade its growth forecasts when it publishes its half-yearly world economic outlook on Tuesday. In a chapter of the outlook published ahead of its official launch, the IMF expressed concern about a buildup of private debt, which it warned could knock a cumulative 0.9% off growth in advanced countries and 1.3% off growth in developing countries over the next three years. “People are facing reversals in development for education, health, and gender equality,” Malpass said. “They’re facing reduced commercial activity and trade. Also the debt crises and currency depreciations have a burden that falls heavily on the poor. “Food crises are bad for everyone, but they are devastating for the poorest and most vulnerable. There are two reasons. First, the world’s poorest countries tend to be food importing countries. Second, that food accounts for at least half of total expenditures in household budgets in low-income countries, so it hits them hardest.” Malpass said central banks should not rely exclusively on interest rates to tackle inflation. “Central banks need to use more tools under current policies. “The inequality gap has widened materially, with wealth and income concentrating in narrow segments of the global population. Rate hikes, interest rate hikes, if that’s the primary tool, will actually add to the inequality challenge that the world is facing.” The World Bank president added: “We’re preparing for a continued crisis response given the multiple crises. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be discussing with our board a new 15-month crisis response envelope of around $170 billion to cover April 2022 through June 2023. We expect to commit around $50 billion of this amount in the next 3 months.” Both the World Bank and IMF are concerned about the number of countries having problems paying their creditors at a time of slowing growth and rising global interest rates. Malpass said there needed to be improvements to the common framework – a mechanism for helping countries with their debt burdens – which has been criticised for being too slow and too limited in its scope. “Due to high debt and deficit levels, countries are under severe financial stress”, he said.",News/Business,World Bank plans $170bn financing to ease ‘multiple crises’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/18/world-bank-plans-170bn-financing-to-ease-multiple-crises
4/19/2022,"CBS News has hired Mick Mulvaney as an on-air contributor. You may recall that Mulvaney served as acting chief of staff under Trump and led Trump’s Office of Management and Budget. But as I’ll get to in a moment, Mulvaney wasn’t just a high official in the Trump administration. He was an active enabler of Trump’s deceit and attempted coup. An “on-air contributor” on a major network is different from a mere “guest”. I’ve been in both roles. Guests appear when a particular program’s producer invites them. “On-air contributors” appear regularly. They’re paid employees. And they’re introduced as contributors – which gives them the cachet and authority of being part of a network’s news division. Mulvaney’s first appearance as a CBS News contributor occurred several days ago on a “MoneyWatch” segment in which he was asked to explain Biden’s plan for taxing the super-rich. The anchor, Anne-Marie Green, introduced Mulvaney as “a former OMB director” and “the guy to ask about this”. But she said nothing about whose OMB he directed, suggesting that Mulvaney was simply a budget expert offering an expert analysis rather than a fierce Trump partisan. Then she asked him whether a “regular working-class American” should care about Biden’s tax proposal. Mulvaney’s answer: “It’s easy to look at it and say, ‘Don’t worry, you’re not going to pay this,’” but regular working Americans would have to “prove that they don’t have to pay it”, a burden that “could be troublesome: every single year proving that you’re not worth a hundred million dollars”. This is as misleading as it gets in broadcast media (except for Fox News). Nothing in Biden’s proposal to tax the super-rich requires that people prove they’re not super-rich. Mulvaney’s claim was pure demagoguery. But that’s what we should expect from Mulvaney. In 2019 Mulvaney threatened to withhold US aid to Ukraine to fight Russian aggression unless President Zelenskiy came up with dirt on Hunter Biden. (This was the call in which Zelenskiy’s plea “we need more Javelins” – anti-tank missiles that have proved crucial in Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion – was met with Trump’s “I would like you to do us a favor though.”) When the quid pro quo came to light, Mulvaney brushed it off: “I have news for everybody: get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.” After Trump withheld the aid, Mulvaney asked White House budget officials for legal justification to withhold it until Zelenskiy announced an investigation of Biden. There was also the time Mulvaney called Covid a “media hoax” designed to bring down Trump. And the time he predicted that if Trump lost in 2020 he would “concede gracefully”. When I was growing up, CBS News was the home of news legends like Edward R Murrow and Walter Cronkite – pioneers who set the standards for broadcast news. So why is CBS News now reaching into the cesspool of Trump conspirators and enablers to hire Mulvaney? Neeraj Khemlani, co-head of CBS News, explained to the CBS News staff at a meeting last month that when it comes to contributor hires, “getting access to both sides of the aisle is a priority because we know the Republicans are going to take over, most likely, in the midterms.” “Getting access” to what? To the big lie about the 2020 election? To lies about Covid? To bonkers economics? Since when does CBS News’s decisions about whom to hire depend on predictions about which party will “take over”, anyway? What if the party that’s predicted to win is so contemptuous of democracy that it continues to claim, without basis in fact or law, that the last presidential election was stolen? Would the CBS News of the 1950s hire as an on-air contributor Senator Joseph McCarthy, who conducted a vicious anti-communist witch-hunt that wrecked the lives and careers of countless Americans, because the news division wanted access to “both sides”? (In fact, CBS News’s Edward R Murrow exposed McCarthy as a liar and demagogue.) If there were ever any doubts that both sides of the political aisle are about the same, the events of the past two years should have laid them to rest. One of America’s two national political parties has embraced (and been embraced by) an anti-democratic extremist fringe. CBS News, like every news outlet, has a cardinal responsibility to protect American democracy from this growing menace. To fulfill this responsibility, it must report accurately what is occurring. It should not pander to the menace by hiring a person who has had a hand in it and will further obscure the truth.

4/19/2022,"Five environmental activists were held on remand over the Easter weekend over protests at oil terminals in Essex and Warwickshire. Three members of the Just Stop Oil campaign held on remand by Warwickshire police were taken to Coventry magistrates court on Monday morning. Katheryn Dowds, 28, Jake Handling, 27, and Josh Smith, 29, pleaded guilty to aggravated trespass at the Kingsbury oil terminal after their solicitor did not appear to advise them, according to a campaign source. Dowds was fined £327, and Handling and Smith were fined £150 each. All were then released, only to be immediately rearrested and held again by police for breaching a high court injunction banning protests at the Kingsbury site, Just Stop Oil said. “It is thought that they will appear tomorrow at Birmingham county court or Coventry in connection with this charge,” the campaign said. In Essex, James Skeet, 34, and Stephanie Aylett, 27, were being held after denying charges of aggravated trespass and breach of bail conditions in an appearance at Chelmsford magistrates court on Saturday. “Magistrates heard how both Skeet and Aylett had been arrested multiple times in Essex since the incidents of disruption began in the early hours of 1 April,” the force said in a statement. Both had been transferred to prison from police custody on Monday, Just Stop Oil said. Their cases were due to be heard on Wednesday. Just Stop Oil has been staging direct actions, including mass trespasses, tunnelling and blockades, at oil terminals and in locations around the Midlands and the south-east of England since 1 April in an effort to disrupt the supply of fossil fuels. They have vowed to continue until the government agrees to a moratorium on new fossil fuel projects. On Saturday, Catherine Maclean, of Hurstpierpoint in West Sussex, became the first person to be convicted over involvement in the Just Stop Oil campaign after admitting aggravated trespass at Chelmsford magistrates court. Just Stop Oil said there had been nearly 1,000 arrests in connection with the campaign so far. Nine more campaign supporters were released without bail after they appeared at Coventry magistrates court on Saturday. Six pleaded not guilty, one pleaded guilty and two entered no plea, according to the campaign. Valero Energy, the Texas-headquartered company that owns Kingsbury, has obtained a high court injunction banning protest activity at any of its six UK sites. “The order gives a power of arrest outside the terminal and at the junctions of the roads leading into the zone,” Warwickshire police said. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil said: “The courts are complicit in supporting a government that is knowingly fuelling climate breakdown and will have the death of millions on its hands. “Just Stop Oil supporters have acted in line with their consciences. Just as the suffragettes and the freedom riders did they have chosen not to be bystanders in the face of the catastrophic and ongoing injustice of climate breakdown. “Some politicians and media pundits have called Just Stop Oil’s demand and its supporters naive. But what is truly naive is the ongoing belief by a political and media establishment that young people will just lie down and die without resisting.”",News/UK news,Just Stop Oil protesters fined and held after weekend protests,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/18/just-stop-oil-protesters-fined-and-held-after-weekend-protests
4/19/2022,"Andrew Dominik, directorI spent seven years thinking about Mark “Chopper” Read. A violent criminal, Mark was notorious in Australia in a minor way – until he published a series of autobiographies, which is how I heard about him. I believe the first one is the most stolen book in Australian publishing history. I see it this way: if violence is a problem, you need to understand the violent person, not the victim. The thing about Mark was his stance of regretting nothing, but then he would describe dreams where he saw his victims. Clearly, there was a disconnect between what he claimed and who he really was. I’m interested in that personal mythology, the way some people don’t see the wider world, just themselves – because I think that’s my own problem. It wasn’t until I actually met Mark that the script took shape. I got a sense of what he was like. He was all feeling. He had a few rules: he didn’t want to be portrayed taking any drugs, committing violence towards women, and nor could any of his poetry be included. All of those things are in the movie. I tried to give him the script while he was still in prison, so he could blow his top and then calm down. But he refused to read it. Every actor in Australia, including Russell Crowe and Ben Mendelsohn, had a go at reading for the role. All the boys want to play psycho killers. Eric Bana didn’t seem like a good idea initially. He was a TV comedian, on a show called Full Frontal, but his audition was amazing. Afterwards, I spent a day working with him. By the end, it was obvious it was going to be him. We never could have made the film for A$2m (£1.1m) if Pentridge Prison, where Mark had been held, hadn’t been decommissioned around that time. We shot it all there, in the places where it actually happened. You can sit with all the accoutrements of film-making, but if you remind actors that this is the room where the stabbing happened, you get a chill you can take advantage of. As a first-time director, I found it pretty scary. The first week, we shot the worst and also the best shit. By the weekend, I had one film that looked like a Jean-Pierre Melville film and another that looked like a Carry On movie. I got rid of the Carry On stuff, then resisted the temptation to be a “good” director – one who meets his daily schedule. I just shot until I thought it was good. Mark said watching the movie made him realise he did crazy things. When he was in the moment, he felt his behaviour was normal. But looking at it from the outside, watching some guy do what he did, he realised he was wrong. I think it’s interesting that he didn’t go back to jail after he became a writer. He was starting to face himself. Australian audiences loved Chopper. There was a cartoon around the time of the Afghanistan invasion, with the prime minister saying: “No, I’m not sending choppers – I’m sending Chopper.” The film made him the most notorious criminal in Australia. I don’t think it turned him into a hero, but charm goes a long way. Eric Bana, actorI grew up in Melbourne, so I knew about Mark and what he’d done. Chopper was a really unusual script – very funny, very dark. I was confident I could portray him. Spending time with Mark was priceless, but I knew there could be real ramifications if things didn’t go well. We just listened to him talk about prison and his theories about life and people. I got that sense of an alpha presence and soaked it up like a sponge. Filming the first half felt like riding a bike up a hill, while the second half was like skateboarding back down it. A lot of the criminals and screws were played by people who had served time in that jail. Being there in the middle of winter had a real dark energy. I always joked with Andrew that there was never a scene when I just asked: “Can I have a pie, please?” Everything was loaded and had deep meaning. During difficult scenes, I fell back on two things: what was truthful and my complete trust in Andrew, that he wasn’t whoring out the subject for some kind of violence porn. It took two to three hours to get ready every day. I would shave my head myself to make the prosthetics for my hacked-off ears easier to glue down. Applying the tattoos took many hours of painstaking hand-drawn artwork and they would only last about two days. So we only did them when I had to have my shirt off. I was probably more worried for Andrew than I was for myself regarding Mark’s reaction. Obviously, I hope he enjoyed my performance, that it didn’t make him cringe and it felt truthful. But I never talked to him directly about it, maybe out of respect. I never pretended Mark and I were going to end up best mates.

4/19/2022,"Harrison Birtwistle, who has died aged 87, was that surprising thing, a deeply English composer who was also internationally renowned as a great modernist. His modernism was of a very particular kind, rooted in the primordial formal elements of music and ritualised theatrical gesture. This gives it an air of being simultaneously modern and ancient. Like that of so many English composers before him, Birtwistle’s music often feels like a slow traversal of a landscape – often a specifically English landscape. And, perhaps most important, myth (often Greek but at times English) is the music’s natural ambience. This made Birtwistle – or Harri, as he was called by those who knew him – stand apart from the European modernists, who tended to be systematisers with a keen and troubled awareness of history arising from the recent past. The negative turn of German contemporaries such as Helmut Lachenmann, whose musical statements are an anguished demonstration of the difficulty of making statements, was utterly foreign to him. For Birtwistle, the mystery of music was a positive mystery; it could be conjured through a combination of iron will and hard work. That belief reveals itself in the music, which has a stubborn power, a sense of pushing and overcoming every obstacle, which is unique. One of Birtwistle’s staunchest admirers, Pierre Boulez, summed up this quality when he said: “Birtwistle’s music has a great power to convince.” That sense of conviction is partly a matter of rhetoric. Birtwistle’s music makes big gestures of a stony kind. Even when the music is quiet, it seems somehow massive. But the conviction is also born out of the way the music works. The pieces often begin by setting out a set of premises, often of the simplest kind – a pulse, a single pitch, a small circling figure. From this something hugely complex grows, with an inevitability easy to feel but hard to analyse. Things unfold with patient slowness, like a river flowing, or the growth of a glacier. If there was a moment when Birtwistle’s musical vision crystallised, it was surely the day in August 1965 when his Tragoedia, for 10 instruments, was premiered at the Wardour Castle summer school in Wiltshire (which he had co-founded the previous year). Eye-witnesses said that at the end Birtwistle jumped up and punched the air in triumph. And rightly so, because Tragoedia was an astounding achievement. It hurls itself at the listener in a series of sharply contrasted musical blocks, arranged in an ingenious cyclic pattern modelled on the formal divisions of the Greek choric ode. The music builds a huge tension, discharged by a plunging slow gesture on the harp that is one of the great endings in music. The music of Trageodia is repeated note-for-note in Birtwistle’s first opera, Punch and Judy, premiered at the Aldeburgh festival in 1968, allied to the familiar tale of ritualised cruelty, and musically augmented to produce a complex series of more than 100 short “numbers”. To hear those two pieces now is to be aware of just how far Birtwistle travelled in the creative career of more than half a century that followed. The fundamental change in this span was a move away from sharply defined blocks separated by silences to a dense continuity, made up of distinct layers or strata, each with its own tempo and character. If one had to name the key date in the emergence of Birtwistle’s “new” style it would be 21 May 1986, the premiere of his opera The Mask of Orpheus at English National Opera. This opera, which was at least 15 years in the making, was described to me by Birtwistle proudly as “perhaps the most complex work of art ever made”. It is scored for a vast orchestra, which includes keening soprano saxophones and a specially invented deep bass drum. Between the scenes are danced Allegories accompanied by immensely powerful electronic music for which much of the credit must go to Barry Anderson, Birtwistle’s co-worker at the Parisian electronic studio IRCAM where these interludes were created. The story of Orpheus’s thwarted marriage to Eurydice, his pursuit of her to the Underworld, and his own violent death are enacted in a formalised way in which actions are repeated, each time from a different perspective, and each character appears in three different incarnations: as a human being, a Hero and a Myth (represented by a huge puppet). It is undoubtedly Birtwistle’s most ambitious work, and it cost him a superhuman effort. Thankfully the prediction of one critic that it was a “beached whale” of an opera and would never be produced again has turned out to be untrue; it was given a new production at ENO in 2019, directed by Daniel Kramer. Entering into this second phase gave Birtwistle a new fluency. Having been a slow and uncertain composer he went on to produce an impressively large work-list, though he always insisted that doubt and “creative blocks” were his constant companions, and that none of his works ever turned out quite how he wanted. This sense of unreachable mystery may partly account for the dark, meditative quality of much of his music. Birtwistle may fairly be described as the great hymner of melancholy among postwar composers, and he loved the tradition of melancholy in European culture. Dowland’s song In Darkness Let Me Dwell was the inspiration for The Shadow of Night (2001) and Dürer’s etching Melencolia I lay behind Melencolia I (1976) and Night’s Black Bird (2004). This strain often emerged in the numerous sets of songs for female voice and a few instruments dotted through his catalogue since the 1980s, based on poets as varied as Rilke, Lorine Niedecker, Paul Celan and Robin Blazer, who was also the librettist of Birtwistle’s opera The Last Supper (1999). Many listeners warm most to this quiet, often miniature-scale Birtwistle, but there is no denying the sheer power of the other Birtwistle, embodied in such works as The Minotaur (2008), which embodies the terrifying power of the beast in its huge clangorous, brass-drenched sounds, and the orchestral masterpiece Earth Dances (1986), often described as a “latter-day Rite of Spring”. Yet at bottom they share the same formal processes, the same tendency to channel strong, even violent, feelings into a tight framework. They also have an expressive kinship. Even the most violent of Birtwistle’s works will have quiet, tender moments, and the quieter pieces are never wholly quiet. Perhaps the most evident link is the importance, in both the meditative and orgiastically violent works, of the notion of interruption. Even the gentlest of his songs have a small crisis at some point, a new foreign element that causes a disturbance. The effect is ambiguous; the disturbance is assuaged, made to seem normal, but it also changes the music’s course. Fatefulness and accident come together, a quality shown vividly in Ritual Fragments, a piece written in 1990 in memory of Michael Vyner, one-time artistic director of the London Sinfonietta. The ensemble as a whole expresses a slowly pacing ritual; within this frame, each instrument pays its own homage in turn, in an outcry that both affirms the music’s ritual nature but also interrupts and transforms it. Although one can feel the influence of other modernists on Birtwistle, above all the ritualistic side of Stravinsky, the peculiar blend of violence, melancholy and aloof formalism is all his own. This surely owes much to his early experiences as a boy in the north of England, where his unusual imagination made him an outsider from the beginning. Born in Accrington, Lancashire, Harri was the only son of Madge (nee Harrison) and Fred Birtwistle. His parents worked in the family bakery business, later acquiring a smallholding. Birtwistle remembered his first pair of shoes were actually clogs. He took up the clarinet and played it in the North East Lancashire military band. However, his most significant childhood memory was of the surrounding countryside, where he would roam for hours. Its rugged integrity was ruptured by the arrival of an immense power station, which the young Birtwistle deeply resented as an intrusion on his idyllic existence. This surely lies behind the idea of a “continuity which has been fractured”, a phrase Birtwistle used half a century later when asked to capture the essence of his music. In 1952, at the age of 18, Birtwistle won a scholarship from Accrington grammar school to the Royal Manchester College of Music (now the Royal Northern College of Music), where he studied clarinet and composition. Alongside him were the other members of what would become known as the Manchester School: the pianist John Ogdon, the trumpeter Elgar Howarth (who as a conductor later became one of Birtwistle’s favourite interpreters), and the composers Peter Maxwell Davies and Alexander Goehr. While Goehr and Maxwell Davies leapt ahead with amazing confidence, Birtwistle seems to have kept his composing ambitions more or less secret; everyone thought of him as a clarinettist. But like them, he was fired up by the avant-garde music filtering into Britain from Europe, and like them he was too independently minded to become a Boulez or Stockhausen epigone. His “Opus 1”, Refrains and Choruses for wind quintet, completed in 1957 after the two-year hiatus of national service, already shows clear signs of the mature Birtwistle in its formalised verse-and-refrain pattern and its fondness for a lean, wind-dominated sound. In 1965 he sold his clarinets, a symbolic declaration of intent to be a composer, and gave up his teaching job at Cranborne Chase school in Wiltshire to take up a Harkness fellowship in the US. There he completed Tragoedia, and later the opera based on it, Punch and Judy. This and the shatteringly loud, rigidly block-like Verses for Ensembles (1968-69) confirmed his reputation as Britain’s most radical composer, alongside Maxwell Davies. But financially this was the most precarious period of Birtwistle’s life. Birtwistle’s determination to compose full-time caused great hardship for his wife, Sheila Duff, a gifted singer who before their marriage in 1958 had a varied career, and his burgeoning family. For a while they lived in an isolated cottage on the Scottish island of Raasay, where they could afford to heat only one room. Things became easier from 1973, when Birtwistle gained two temporary teaching posts in the US. By then he had already completed his first big orchestral work, The Triumph of Time (1971-72), partly inspired by Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s eponymous engraving. Birtwistle’s second opera, The Mask of Orpheus, had by now already been commissioned by Covent Garden, but it would be 16 years before it finally reached the stage, in 1986, by which time the commission had moved to ENO. In the meantime, Birtwistle had been invited by Peter Hall to work as director of music and then associate director at the National Theatre (1975-88). The experience of working with Hall on Tony Harrison’s new translation of The Oresteia (1981) was decisive in formulating the theatrical language of Birtwistle’s opera. In 1986, the same year as the premiere of Orpheus, Birtwistle was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary, Behind the Mask. He had now definitively arrived, both in terms of status and musically, in the sense that his music had entered into a “late style” that it would keep for the rest of his creative career. Birtwistle went on in the following two decades to write four more full-length operas and several small-scale music-theatre pieces. Gawain, based on Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and premiered in 1991, is the apogee of Birtwistle’s fondness for English folk tales. Here his obsession with cycles and symmetries is still uppermost. The key actions of beheading and seduction occur twice, and at the mid-point there is a vast cyclic episode portraying the turning of the seasons. But the growth in self-knowledge of the main character shows a new willingness to admit narrative into his theatre. The trend continued in The Second Mrs Kong, first seen at Glyndebourne in 1994, a part mythic, part urban fantasy about the “spirit of Kong”, now marooned in an underworld peopled by grotesques, and his quest for his beloved Pearl (the Girl with the Pearl Earring immortalised by Vermeer). The opera even has moments of farce, not a mood one ever expected to find in Birtwistle. The Last Supper (Staatsoper Berlin, 2000) imagines Christ and his disciples gathered together in our own time, to re-enact the supper and the washing of the feet after “two millennia of bestiality and vileness”. Impressive though these works are, it is hard not to feel that Birtwistle’s genius is sometimes obscured by the moralising and narrative superstructure. His theatre is most riveting where it is latent, as in Theseus Game for ensemble and two conductors, premiered in 2003. And his engagement with texts is most persuasive in the small confines of song settings, as in Pulse Shadows (1989-96), settings of nine poems by Celan interleaved with nine movements for string quartet – surely the masterpiece of Birtwistle’s later years. At the opposite pole to the gnomic profundity of these songs is the thrillingly virtuosic Harrison’s Clocks (1997-98) written for the pianist Joanna MacGregor, a set of ticking, whirring musical mechanisms inspired by John Harrison, the inventor of a mechanism that would keep precise time at sea. In his later years, spent (from 1992 onwards) in a converted silk factory in Wiltshire, the works continued to come thick and fast. Honours and appointments arrived: a knighthood in 1988, the Grawemeyer award in 1989, the first Henry Purcell professorship of composition at Kings College London, from 1994 to 2001, the Siemens prize in 1995. His 80th birthday year prompted several retrospective series and a burst of new works, including the piano concerto Responses: Sweet Disorder and the Carefully Careless, premiered in London at the Southbank Centre by Pierre-Laurent Aimard and the London Philharmonic conducted by Vladimir Jurowski. Though there were no more operas on the scale of The Minotaur, Birtwistle composed several more chamber-sized music-theatre pieces, including two based on texts by his closest collaborator, the poet David Harsent: The Corridor (2008) and The Cure (2015). Though his creativity remained undimmed, Birtwistle’s later years were overshadowed by the increasing ill-health of Sheila, who suffered from Parkinson’s disease. He cultivated a deliberate curmudgeonliness, which became more pronounced as his eminence increased. “I’m not establishment,” he would growl. “People think I am, but I’m not.” In 1995 he had a chance to demonstrate that when he was invited to write a piece for the Last Night of the Proms, and produced a saxophone concerto of blistering violence entitled Panic, which caused widespread offence. Birtwistle’s growliness sometimes took on a scornful tone, and he was not always kind in his attitude to younger composers. But he could be a charming host too, showing visitors round the sunken garden of his home in Wiltshire, talking about the difficulties of breeding turtles, enthusing over his much-thumbed volumes of Pevsner or books on the symbolism of the Green Man. As Hall remarked, one of Birtwistle’s great strengths was his naivety. In conversation he was as likely to refer to The Wind in the Willows as Paul Klee or the diagrams in D’Arcy Thompson’s On Growth and Form (two other profound influences on him). He never lost his fascination with the simplest elements of musical form, a fascination always expressed in an empirical way. Birtwistle was never a systematic or theorising composer, which is part of what makes him very English; that and the sheer sound of the music, with its slowly unfolding landscapes, its eruptive bawdiness, its modal, antique-sounding lyricism. Yeats once described the English mind as “meditative, rich, deliberate”; it would be hard to find a better description of the music of Birtwistle. Sheila died in 2012. Birtwistle is survived by their sons, Adam, Silas and Toby.

4/19/2022,"The Beanstalk cryptocurrency has been stripped of reserves valued at more than $180m (£138m) in seconds, after an attacker used borrowed money to snap up enough voting rights to transfer the money away. The lightning hostile takeover raises fresh questions about the unregulated nature of digital currencies and the lack of protections for investors. Describing itself as a “decentralised credit based stablecoin protocol”, Beanstalk offers a cryptocurrency, called beans, intended to have a stable value of $1 a coin. It effectively operated as a bank, letting savers (“bean farmers”) make deposits (of “beans” into a “field”), and using their savings to ensure that the value of a single bean stayed as close to $1 as possible. Others were encouraged to deposit cryptocurrencies such as ether into a “silo” to build up the stablecoin’s reserves in exchange for voting rights over the operation of the organisation. On Sunday night, one such vote resulted in Beanstalk’s entire silo, worth around $182m at market rates, being transferred out of the organisation. A still-unidentified attacker had borrowed $80m in cryptocurrency and deposited it in the project’s silo, gaining enough voting rights in exchange to be able to pass any proposal instantly. With that power, they voted to transfer the contents of the treasury to themselves, then returned the voting rights, withdrew their money, and repaid the loan – all in a matter of seconds. “It’s very like a hostile corporate raid funded by junk bonds – except it was over in 10 seconds,” said David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. “In regulated markets, we have laws and regulations on how you can take over a company and drain it, but it’s not clear that this action was illegal. Even the project concedes that the raider acted according to the rules that Beanstalk set out.” Stephen Diehl, a cryptocurrency expert, said the attack was in a grey area. “It’s possible for someone to basically buy up all the shares in the organisation. In the normal corporate world this would be illegal because it’s embezzlement and self-dealing. However, with a DAO [decentralised autonomous organisation], it basically exists outside of any regulatory perimeter – so basically anything goes and the code dictates everything. It’s technically ‘legal’ in some sense, but it’s a very grey area.” “Honestly not sure what to type,” the project’s co-founders said on Sunday in a Discord message announcing the losses. “We are fucked. This project has not had any venture backing, so it is highly unlikely there is any sort of bailout coming.” However, they disputed the claim that, because the attack exploited governance procedures, it was technically legal. “Earlier this morning, as soon as we learned of the attack, we contacted the FBI and informed the FBI’s internet crime center of the attack,” they wrote. “We intend to fully cooperate with the FBI to track down the perpetrators, and hopefully recover everything that was stolen.” Immediately following the attack, the value of beans “broke the peg”, trading for significantly less than the $1 a token that was supposed to be the stable value. However, on Monday the stablecoin’s value had not hit zero and was around $0.12, since some traders were voluntarily buying beans, betting that some rescue package would arrive to rebuild the project’s treasury and restore the peg.",News/Technology,Beanstalk cryptocurrency loses $182m of reserves in flash ‘attack’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/18/beanstalk-cryptocurrency-loses-182m-of-reserves-in-flash-attack
4/19/2022,"Boris Johnson has been told his Downing Street office has been targeted with “multiple” suspected infections using Pegasus, the sophisticated hacking software made by Israel’s NSO group, which can turn a phone into a remote listening device, it was claimed on Monday. A report, released by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto on Monday, said it believed that No 10 had fallen prey to a spyware attack in 2020 and 2021, with the United Arab Emirates being the suspected orchestrator. Pegasus is the hacking software – or spyware – developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli firm NSO Group. It has the capability to infect phones running either iOS or Android operating systems. Citizen Lab, considered among the world’s leading experts in detecting digital attacks, announced it had taken the rare step of notifying Whitehall of the attack as it “believes that our actions can reduce harm”. In a statement, Citizen Lab said: “We confirm that in 2020 and 2021 we observed and notified the government of the United Kingdom of multiple suspected instances of Pegasus spyware infections within official UK networks. These included: the prime minister’s office (10 Downing Street) [and] the Foreign and Commonwealth Office … The suspected infection at the UK prime minister’s office was associated with a Pegasus operator we link to the UAE.” However, the researchers were not able to identify the specific individuals within No 10 and the Foreign Office who are suspected of having been hacked. The Biden administration took the extraordinary step of placing NSO on a US blacklist last November, saying it had evidence the company had sold surveillance spyware to foreign governments that had used it for “transnational repression”. At the time, an NSO spokesperson said it was ‘“dismayed by the decision”. The revelations will raise significant questions about a possible national security breach at the highest levels of the British government. The prime minister’s office and the UAE government have been approached for comment. An NSO spokesperson said: “NSO continues to be targeted by a number of politically motivated advocacy organisations like Citizen Lab and Amnesty to produce inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports based on vague and incomplete information. “We have repeatedly cooperated with governmental investigations, where credible allegations merit. However, information raised regarding these allegations are, yet again, false and could not be related to NSO products for technological and contractual reasons.” More follows …",News/Politics,"No 10 suspected of being target of NSO spyware attack, Boris Johnson ‘told’",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/no-10-suspected-of-being-target-of-nso-spyware-attack-boris-johnson
4/19/2022,"For days after the Moskva cruiser sank in the Black Sea, Yulia Tsyvova had been desperately searching for information about her son Andrei. Like hundreds of other Russian families of the crew members, she had not been told whether he had survived the reported Ukrainian missile attack that had sunk the Russian flagship of the Black Sea fleet. Then on Monday morning she received a call from the Russian defence ministry. Her son was dead. “He was only 19, he was a conscript,” said Tsyvova, who wept as she spoke by telephone. “They didn’t tell me anything else, no information on when the funeral would be. “I am sure he isn’t the only one who died.” Family members of sailors who served onboard the Moskva are demanding answers as the ministry has sought to suppress information about what happened to the ship or its estimated 510-strong crew. The total number of dead, wounded and missing remains a state secret. Tsyvov’s death, which has not been previously reported, is only the second confirmed from the warship. Another three families have gone public saying they cannot find their sons who were serving onboard. Media reports suggest the number of casualties from the attack will be far higher, and the efforts to suppress information about the deaths have raised comparisons with the Kursk submarine incident that left 118 sailors dead and struck a blow to the prestige of a young President Vladimir Putin in 2000. “This regime has never been very transparent about casualties,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, pointing to Russia’s military operations in Ukraine and Syria or the investigations into attacks at Beslan and the Dubrovka theatre. “A lot of this has precedence and it’s not something very new or very surprising.” New information on the young sailors who died will also renew scrutiny about the Russian government’s use of conscripts in battle, something Putin had explicitly denied was the case early in the war. The defence ministry was forced to admit it had deployed conscripts after some were captured in Ukraine in the first weeks of the war. It claimed it would no longer use them. But several parents of Moskva crew members have told the Guardian and others that their sons onboard the ship were indeed conscripts and not professional soldiers on contract. “A conscript who isn’t supposed to see active fighting is among those missing in action,” wrote Dmitry Shkrebets, whose son Yegor was a cook on the ship and is listed as missing in action. “Guys, how can you be missing in action in the middle of the high seas?!!!” Photos and a video purporting to show the Moskva shortly before it sank emerged on Monday, nearly four days after it sank. The images showed that its lifeboats had been deployed, indicating an order was likely given to abandon ship. Families of several crew members have said they managed to locate their family members alive. Eskender Djeparov said he recognised his brother Akbar in a video released by the defence ministry that showed sailors from the Moskva meeting a top admiral in Sevastopol after the ship sank. “We were very happy when we saw him in the video of the crew in Sevastopol,” Djeparov said. “The day after the tragedy, he called our mother and said that he is alive and well. That she shouldn’t worry about him. He hasn’t told us what happened, he doesn’t say much. He calls us from different numbers. He is a conscript, he started last July. He definitely never signed a contract.” A family member of crew member Evgeny Grinberg said via online messenger that “his condition is fine and I do not intend to divulge military secrets”. “It’s fraught with consequences,” wrote Valery Grinburg of Monchegorsk, near Murmansk. “And Evgeny did not say anything anyway.” Asked if he was onboard the ship, he wrote “yes” and then deleted the message. Asked how he knew about his relative’s condition, he wrote: “I called into the ministry of defence.” But many others have been less lucky. Shkrebets was one of the first to go public demanding answers about why his son was sent to war. “They said that the entire crew was evacuated. It’s a lie! A cruel and cynical lie!” His wife, Irina, told the independent Russian website the Insider that they had seen about 200 injured sailors at a military hospital in Crimea while looking for their son. The total crew of the Moskva was estimated at just over 500. “We looked at every burnt kid,” she told the Insider. “I can’t tell you how hard it was, but I couldn’t find mine. There were only 200 people, and there were more than 500 onboard the cruiser. Where were the others? We looked in Krasnodar, and everywhere else, we called every place, but we couldn’t find him.” Other families had reached out to the Shkrebets hoping to find more information. “We were contacted by three families from Yalta, Alupka and St Petersburg, whose children are also missing, also conscripts,” her husband wrote on Monday, adding they had submitted a written request for more information at the local enlistment office. “We need written answers to our questions about finding our children, not text messages with pictures and prayers,” he said. Other parents were clearly more fearful of speaking out. Ulyana Tarasova of St Petersburg wrote online: “My son, Tarasov Mark, is missing in action aboard the cruiser Moskva.” Hours later, her post was gone. Others who spoke with Russian media have asked for anonymity for fear of facing reprisals from the government. The mother of another sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe website that three missiles had struck the Moskva. She said about 40 people had died, several were missing, and “there are many wounded”.",News/World news,‘We need answers’: relatives seek Moskva warship’s missing crew,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/moskva-warship-need-answers-relatives-missing-crew-russia
4/19/2022,"Children are accidentally coming across far-right material online while innocently carrying out research for school projects, a teachers’ conference has heard. Delegates debating the influence of the far right in schools heard that children’s access to social media and smartphones means they are more at risk of being exposed to extremist material than ever before. In one example cited during the debate, a teacher described how pupils searching the internet for information about the Holocaust for their homework were as likely to find articles written by Holocaust deniers as genuine historical accounts. The debate was tabled at the annual conference of the NASUWT teachers’ conference amid growing concern in schools about what was described as the “insidious radicalisation” of children. Teachers said the casual use of hate speech by politicians and leaders is “filtering rapidly into our schools and the homes of our learners”. They also said the pandemic had increased the risk for young people, who were forced to spend more time online during lockdown. Rachel Minto, from North Tyneside, addressing the conference, said she was alarmed and appalling by the gradual normalisation of far-right views and described the ease with which fascists were gaining access to young minds. “Gone are the days when far-right information and propaganda was confined to the back rooms of seedy pubs and clubs. This material can now be accessed 24/7 with a few swipes of your phone. “More worryingly, children can accidentally come across this material whilst innocently researching for school projects. A Google search on the Holocaust can bring up information provided by a Holocaust denier as easily as legitimate or sound historical documentation.” Candida Mellor, a French teacher also from North Tyneside, said: “We need to actively educate our students about online infiltration of far-right messages. These insidious organisations use subtle tactics to indoctrinate very vulnerable children.” She called for more support for teachers. “I need educating on how to help my students to understand what these messages are and how to avoid them, how to understand how they’re affecting them.” The NASUWT general secretary, Dr Patrick Roach, said official numbers of reported hate crimes have risen to more than 124,000 a year in England and Wales, of which nearly three-quarters were racially motivated. “We are alarmed by the incidence of far-right extremism and hate crimes in the UK. Over the last decade, the government has peddled a hostile environment agenda, which has created the conditions for hatred to flourish. “Schools are not immune, as children and young people are often exposed to hate speech on social media and elsewhere. More needs to be done to examine and address the problem of extremism within schools and colleges. “Concerted government-level action is urgently needed to support schools in tackling the problem and to support pupils and teachers who have been targeted and victimised. “Anti-racism must be central to the curriculum and schools and colleges must also be supported and equipped to provide a curriculum that challenges all forms of bigotry, prejudice and hatred.” Teachers at the conference voted on Monday for the union to lobby the government to invest in new international education programmes to promote diversity, and to produce better training for members to help them challenge far-right views when they arise in the classroom.",News/Politics,"Children coming across far-right material when researching, teachers say",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/18/children-coming-across-far-right-material-when-researching-teachers-say
