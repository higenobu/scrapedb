1/10/2022,"Hospitals in England will be able to use private hospitals and staff under a deal with the NHS to maintain services as Omicron cases surge, avoiding delays in treatment for patients with illnesses such as cancer. The move comes as hospitals have also been told to find extra beds in gyms and education centres owing to rising numbers of Covid patients.  The three-month agreement means private healthcare staff and facilities will be on standby to support the NHS if they need it and to maintain services for patients that can be referred including some of those waiting for cancer surgery. Nightingale hubs are already being created in the grounds of some hospitals as part of a move to create up to 4,000 extra beds. Announcing the deal, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “This agreement demonstrates the collaboration across our healthcare services to create an additional safeguard that ensures people can continue to get the care they need from our world-leading NHS, whenever they need it.” The move has been put in place to make sure the health service is not overwhelmed and avoid implementing further Covid restrictions on socialising at pubs, clubs and sports venues as have been introduced in Scotland and Wales. Last week, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said more than one in six NHS trusts across England had declared a critical incident due to Covid pressures in recent weeks, adding that the Omicron variant was putting “very real” pressure on the health service. The agreement includes Practice Plus Group, Spire Healthcare, Nuffield Health, Circle Health Group, Ramsay Health Care UK, Healthcare Management Trust, One Healthcare, Horder Healthcare, Aspen Healthcare and KIMS Hospital, the NHS said. Paolo Pieri, the CEO of Circle, said that since the first Covid wave in March 2020, its hospitals had supported the NHS by performing urgent, life-saving operations and treatments for more than 400,000 NHS patients. “We stand ready to support the NHS in its time of need,” Pieri said. Spire said the final details of the contract still had to be agreed. The deal expires on 31 March. A Whitehall source told the Telegraph: “We are going to do everything we can to avoid more restrictions … Our lines of defence through vaccines, testing and antivirals are crucial and holding up but we are also boosting NHS capacity as much as we can.” “Sajid wants the NHS to make use of the independent sector if needed. The aim is to ensure as much capacity as possible is available to help the NHS get through the Omicron wave.”In March 2020, a similar deal costing about £400m was agreed, when private hospitals provided more beds, ventilators and thousands of extra healthcare staff to help the NHS fight against Covid. At the time, 20,000 staff were offered, including 10,000 nurses and 700 doctors. The number of hospitalisations have been slower to rise than Covid cases, with ministers buoyed by the booster rollout. However, hospitals have struggled due to NHS staff being among the hundreds of thousands of people self-isolating due to the rapidly increasing number of Omicron cases. More than 140,000 more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK. A further 141,472 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases were recorded as of 9am on Sunday, the fourth consecutive day that infection numbers have fallen.",News/Society,NHS England strikes private hospitals deal to fight Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/10/nhs-england-strikes-private-hospitals-deal-to-fight-omicron-surge
1/10/2022,"Aldi’s sales edged higher in the month leading up to Christmas, as the German discounter enjoyed its “best ever” festive period and predicted it would prosper as households tighten their belts. Sales at the supermarket chain were up 0.4% in December 2021 compared with the equivalent month in 2020, despite a boost that year from people ordering more groceries amid a lockdown that forced hospitality venues to close.  Kicking off the Christmas updates for supermarkets, Aldi claimed figures from research firm Kantar show it was the “only major supermarket” to increase its sales in December. Its sales growth over the month was partly driven by record sales of its premium range and strong demand for beer, wine and spirits. Its chief executive said the discounter stood to benefit even further if people opt for cheaper shopping lists this year, as a cost-of-living crisis looms due to soaring energy bills and higher taxes. Giles Hurley, the chief executive of Aldi UK, said: “There’s no doubt that 2021 was a long and difficult year for lots of people, but our amazing colleagues stopped at nothing as they came together to deliver the Christmas that our customers deserved. “As we look ahead, the top priority for most families this year will be managing their household budgets in the face of rising living costs. “As the cheapest supermarket in Britain, Aldi will always offer the lowest prices for groceries, no matter what, and continue to support our British farmers and producers.” Aldi UK and Ireland, privately owned by the German company Aldi Sud, said its sales were up 8.1% compared with 2019, before the pandemic affected trading. The group is Britain’s fifth largest supermarket group with a 7.7% market share. While Aldi claimed to be the only supermarket to enjoy higher year-on-year sales during December 2021, several big supermarkets are yet to release figures. Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Marks & Spencer are due to release festive trading figures later this week.",News/Business,"Aldi reports ‘best ever’ Christmas amid strong demand for beer, wine and spirits",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/aldi-christmas-supermarket
1/10/2022,"The double shock of Donald Trump’s election and Leave’s referendum win in 2016 sent political commentators scurrying for an explanation. The blame was largely placed on members of a smug liberal elite, who had grown so convinced of their own status and opinions that they ignored the growing discontent of their fellow citizens. Trump’s win and Brexit were, in their different ways, a reason and an opportunity for those who had been “left behind” to kick back. There’s much to this argument. In western democracies, modern political parties of centre left and right have increasingly emphasised merit as the basis on which society should be organised. The promise of “equality of opportunity” – which has involved a massive expansion of higher education – was that it would temper the inequalities produced by market economics. But too often the reality of meritocracy has been that the wealthy use their privilege to monopolise the most prestigious schools and universities, and gain the qualifications that act as a ticket to success. Those without degrees have seen their access to high-status jobs blocked. The rich have got ever richer while non-graduate earnings have stagnated.  Worst of all, the plutocrats in charge now think they have earned their privilege through brainpower and hard work, rather than inheritance. Yet these highly qualified elites have left their nations with a series of unwinnable wars, a financial crisis, accelerating climate change and far lower rates of economic growth than in the postwar decades. There’s no monopoly of error here, though. Those who voted for Trump and Brexit have a different but equally dubious idea of what a meritocracy should look like. Leave voters, for instance, are more likely to take a tough stance on the “undeserving” poor, whose benefits they see as unearned, and on immigrants “jumping the queue” for housing. They may believe their efforts deserve greater reward and object to the advancement of people both above and below them on the ladder. After becoming prime minister, Theresa May, speaking to Brexit voters, offered a “vision for a truly meritocratic Britain … ordinary working-class people … deserve a better deal”. Politicians from all parties talk about “people who work hard and play by the rules” with the frequency of a catechism. The best of the post-populist backlash books, such as Michael Sandel’s Tyranny of Merit, accept that the current elites do not represent a genuine meritocracy, but take the argument a stage further. Even if we could somehow organise society to ensure genuine equality of opportunity, and allow everyone a fair shot at success, would we want to? After all, the term “meritocracy” was coined by the sociologist and politician Michael Young in his 1958 book, which imagined it leading to a dystopia where a high-IQ elite, certain their position was justified, lorded it over everyone else until rebellion ensued. Sandel’s view is that our talents are not deserved any more than the advantages bestowed by wealthy, well-connected parents. They are also an accident of birth. In her recent book, The Genetic Lottery, Kathryn Paige Harden notes that there is a 1 in 70tn chance that any given child emerges from the combination of their parents’ genetic material. None of us control either the genes we are born with or the environment we are born into. You may think that, regardless of your natural talents, you still had to work hard to achieve your successes. But it is our genes, too, that help to determine how conscientious we are, how well we can concentrate and so on. Sandel points out that the same logic applies even if you are religious and don’t accept a purely biological account of human behaviour. If your talents were bestowed by an omnipotent god then your achievements are no more due to your personal merit than if they were a genetic accident. But fully accepting this logic is almost impossible. When Luther and Calvin strongly reasserted Augustine’s principle of salvation by grace alone, their followers found it impossible to believe their own actions made no difference to their eternal fate, so ended up seeing their good works as evidence of God’s plan to save them. They did “deserve” it after all. The same is true in our more secular world. While people may be able to accept the logic of Sandel and Harden in theory, it would be very hard to organise society if, in practice, people weren’t incentivised by the prospect of reward for what feel like their efforts. And both authors struggle to offer pragmatic suggestions on how to reduce the fixation on merit. Harden, writing for a US audience, merely proposes the kind of welfare state common in Europe, which, while obviously preferable, still leaves huge inequalities. Sandel pushes for a redistribution of status based on civic and moral worth rather than just financial success, which simply changes the definition of merit to one he’s more comfortable with. Meritocracy as an organising principle is an inevitable function of a free society. We are designed to see our achievements as worthy of reward and any politician who tried to suggest otherwise wouldn’t be long in elected office. But the raft of books about the limits of merit is an important correction to the arrogance of contemporary entitlement and an opportunity to reassert the importance of luck, or grace, in our political thinking. The more we are able to accept our achievements are largely out of our control, the easier it becomes to understand that our failures, and those of others, are too. And that in turn should increase our humility and the respect with which we treat our fellow citizens. Ultimately, as the writer David Roberts put it: “Building a more compassionate society means reminding ourselves of luck, and of the gratitude and obligations it entails.”  Sam Freedman is a senior fellow at the Institute for Government and a former adviser at the department for education.

1/10/2022,"Cole Palmer capped a man-of-the-match performance with a pearl of a strike in victory at Swindon but he was not the only 19-year-old England youth international to shine. On the opposite flank – and for the opposing team – the on-loan Kaine Kesler Hayden did not look out of place up against Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva. Kesler Hayden, who was called up to the England Under-20 squad in September, impressed the Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, so much that on Sunday he recalled the right-wing back. Kesler Hayden bombed forward at every opportunity and in the second half Rodri earned a booking after resorting to shoving the advancing defender to the floor. There was a cheeky nutmeg on João Cancelo but his sweetest moment was surely the sprint and tackle to cleanly snaffle the ball from De Bruyne. Gerrard is keen to bolster his defensive options and, on Friday’s evidence at least, Kesler Hayden looks ready to star. Ben Fisher  Match report: Swindon 1-4 Manchester City Sometimes, just sometimes, dreams really can come true. Given that Joe Ironside grew up watching Alan Shearer play No 9 for Newcastle and still idolises him, it seemed somehow fitting that Cambridge United’s Middlesbrough-born striker scored the goal which sealed a 1-0 win for Mark Bonner’s impressively choreographed League One side – along with the shock of the third round. Hats off, too, to Dimitar Mitov, Bonner’s Bulgarian goalkeeper – and Ironside’s housemate – who made some fabulous saves against Eddie Howe’s generally very disappointing team. Newcastle seemed to surrender after Ironside’s goal and it was all too easy to understand how they have won only once all season. Small wonder the club’s chairman, Yasir al-Rumayyan, who, accompanied by a quartet of bodyguards, had flown in from Saudi Arabia to watch the tie, took the highly unusual step of visiting the home dressing room to deliver a post-match pep talk. Louise Taylor Match report: Newcastle 0-1 Cambridge Amari Morgan-Smith has defended the pitch invasion that followed Kidderminster’s memorable FA Cup third-round triumph over Reading. The National League North side’s striker scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute but, after 14 added minutes were played, the Aggborough pitch was stormed by hundreds of fans, the vast majority of whom were celebrating the 2-1 triumph. Veljko Paunovic, the Reading manager, complained that his players were endangered as his team and coaching staff were verbally accosted but Morgan-Smith could see the traditional aspect of Kidderminster’s emotional achievement. The 32-year-old said: “It’s one of those moments we’ve all seen happen so many times over the years in the FA Cup – there’s a giantkilling act and the fans come on to the pitch. So it’s been part and parcel of the game really. The players gave everything for the fans and the vast majority were only there to show their appreciation, which was nice. It took me a while to get back to the dressing room and I was cramping up in my legs, so it took me even longer than most.” Peter Lansley Match report: Kidderminster 1-0 Reading It was, as Thomas Tuchel kept pointing out, only against a fifth-tier side, but still there was much to enjoy in the performance of Chelsea’s debutant 17-year-old left-back Lewis Hall. He was quick and purposeful, looked comfortable on the ball, showing no signs of the pre-match nerves of which he later spoke. He got forward repeatedly, crossing for Romelu Lukaku to score the third and unleashing the shot that was blocked before Andreas Christensen headed in the rebound for the fourth. With Ben Chilwell and Reece James both suffering long-term injuries, Chelsea are in need of another full-back and have made initial approaches to Everton’s unsettled former Barcelona left-back Lucas Digne. Playing in the Premier League, clearly, is another level, and Hall was not tested defensively, but it may be that Hall did enough to suggest that it’s at least worth considering him as cover for Marcos Alonso. Jonathan Wilson Match report: Chelsea 5-1 Chesterfield Jack Butland must have been the most relieved man in south London on Saturday night after Crystal Palace swept aside Millwall following his first-half error. The former England goalkeeper was making only his sixth start for Palace since joining from Stoke in October 2020 and showed mental resilience in making some important saves in the second half to ensure his side set up a home tie against Hartlepool in the fourth round. “Jack has a really strong character and he’s surrounded by people who really want him to do well,” said Patrick Vieira. “He understands the mistakes and he will bounce back. He is an international player but when you are not playing every week, of course the confidence is not there. But the way he has been working when he has not been in the team has been brilliant and I’m glad to have him here.”Ed Aarons  Match report: Millwall 1-2 Crystal Palace Nikola Vlasic has not found it easy since joining West Ham last summer. The Croatian did not have much time to adapt after arriving on the final day of the transfer window and has not had many chances to show why David Moyes thought that he was worth £25.7m. West Ham’s attack was settled and Vlasic, who had a disappointing spell at Everton before joining CSKA Moscow, struggled to break into the team. Now, though, he has a chance. Saïd Benrahma is away at the African Cup of Nations with Algeria and West Ham need Vlasic to step up. He has a lot of talent and played well as West Ham eased past Leeds, playing a crucial role in Manuel Lanzini’s opening goal. “Vlasic played well,” Moyes said. “He’s a really good lad. I’ve got a lot of faith in him and think he’ll come good.” Jacob Steinberg Match report: West Ham 2-0 Leeds Liverpool’s teenage right flank encapsulated the team’s afternoon against Shrewsbury – struggling initially against Nathanael Ogbeta’s threat on the counterattack or to break down a deep defence before delivering a composed, confident performance that demonstrated Jürgen Klopp’s belief in the talents of Kaide Gordon and Conor Bradley. The 18-year-old Bradley, already a Northern Ireland international, provided two assists as Liverpool eventually eased into round four while Gordon, at 17 years and 96 days, overtook Michael Owen as the second youngest goalscorer in the club’s history with a polished equaliser. Klopp said: “They both can be so much better because they are real talents. We know how good Conor can be and Kaide, finishing-wise he is an adult, but in all the rest he is still a kid. When he gets in these situations he is really calm. He has a nose for it. Kaide has time, but he will have his minutes here and there. He only just came back from Covid as well. It is really not easy to show up in a game like this and he did.” Andy Hunter Match report: Liverpool 4-1 Shrewsbury Masking over the issues at handor a genuine cause for optimism moving forward? That was the question for many Everton supporters on Saturday night as they made their way back along the M62 after booking their place in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Victory against Hull was certainly hard fought, and not without its nervy moments throughout the course of 120 minutes. But in a way, as Rafa Benítez pointed out, that was perhaps the biggest positive of all. Everton, no strangers to adversity this season, faced a serious test of their mettle against Hull, especially after going a goal behind inside the opening minute. That they showed the desire and resilience to ultimately prevail in the tie was encouraging for Benítez, and it is a trait they will have to call on again in the coming weeks if the Spaniard is to win over his doubters. Aaron Bower  Match report: Hull 2-3 Everton Milot Rashica could hardly miss. A late tap-in at the Valley served to both open his Norwich account, and secure a fourth-round tie at Wolves. Of equal importance, extra time was avoided. Neither player nor team needed that. Norwich’s £60m summer spend gave them Europe’s 11th biggest transfer outlay. Their perilous Premier League position therefore, represents failure. Of the 11 new faces brought in, most supporters would pick Kosovan Rashica as the standout. His return to fitness then, is timely. Without him, the Canaries secured just one point from six top-flight games, scoring just once. Faint hopes of survival may just rest on Rashica’s shoulders. Sam Dalling Match report: Charlton 0-1 Norwich One game into his Arsenal career, it all looked too good to be true for Charlie Patino, the much whispered-about 18-year-old who marked his debut against Sunderland last month with a well-taken goal and in the process seemed to confirm all the swirling hype. His second appearance, this time against rather less accommodating opponents, delivered something of a reality check for anyone who imagined that he would be able to reproduce his youth-team displays at senior level without overcoming a hurdle or two on the way. Patino didn’t do a lot wrong on Sunday but he didn’t do much right either, traipsing off after 68 minutes having made fewer passes than the opposition keeper – not a statistic you would want against your name as a central midfielder. Patino is clearly supremely gifted and may well go on to become an all-time Arsenal great. Sunday was a reminder that such a fate is anything but guaranteed.

1/10/2022,"Life comes fast at supporters of Newcastle United. No sooner were they prancing around in Arab headpieces while contemplating the appearance of Kylian Mbappé in the cafes of Jesmond than they had to swallow an FA Cup exit at the hands of a club whose previous claim to fame was the completion of 31 matches without a win. Before we go any further, it should be noted that followers of Sunderland have no cause to chortle; their own run towards competitive irrelevance is such that Cambridge United provide routine opposition. Elsewhere, though, the laughing has been audible. Cambridge’s 1-0 win was a hugely popular one. Sympathy for long suffering fans in black and white? A distant memory.  Newcastle’s takeover by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund has led to the club being replaced as everyone’s cuddly second team. There are shades of jealousy attached to that – who wouldn’t want their club controlled by an entity with an estimated value of $500bn? – but also an element of moral repulsion. Saudi’s appalling record on human rights and reported involvement in the death of Jamal Khashoggi matters considerably more than the image of flags flying in the Gallowgate End. And fly they have; the demonisation of Mike Ashley on Tyneside was such that you were left with the impression the Jack the Ripper would be afforded herograms so long as he removed Sports Direct branding from St James’ Park. “We have our club back” was the cry, as if Newcastle had been purchased by the cast of Jossy’s Giants. A deflating, if predictable, business. By the time Newcastle edged past Burnley – Burnley! – on 4 December, players engulfed in a Premier League relegation battle were completing a lap of honour. The dawning of a new era, undermined by a subsequent tanking in Leicester. In the absence of Jim Barclay, Amanda Staveley and Yasir al-Rumayyan – reportedly flanked by bodyguards – gave a dressing-room message of support to Newcastle’s beleaguered players as their Cambridge counterparts partied. Players, surely, Newcastle would upgrade in a heartbeat. The cost of doing precisely that spirals with every on-field embarrassment. Newcastle should have had more than enough to see off Cambridge, four points from the relegation places in League One, but theirs is a squad lacking talent and, more ominously given the on-field predicament, character. Newcastle’s response to conceding Joe Ironside’s goal was more pitiful than the fact it happened in the first place. Neither Staveley nor Rumayyan have previous experience of running a football club. Despite spending years on the messy deal to purchase Newcastle, PIF breezed into office in early October without a manager – Steve Bruce was forced to limp on in unedifying style – or a director of football. Three months on, the Saudis have provided Eddie Howe (after a botched attempt to prise Unai Emery from Villarreal) with a 31-year-old full-back in Kieran Trippier and Nicky Hammond, a recruitment consultant whose performance at Celtic should have set off alarm balls long before Hadrian’s Wall. Howe’s coaching credentials are widely lauded but he will recognise that he is featuring in a totally different movie to anything that has come before. When West Ham and Crystal Palace can pay players more than £100,000 per week, the challenge Howe has in convincing individuals of suitable mindset and ability to join a side with one win in 19 league attempts is abundantly clear. Geography has never been in Newcastle’s favour when it comes to transfer business. It may look mean-spirited to take a swipe at Newcastle – a terrific city that houses passionate and good-natured football followers – at this low ebb but episodes such as Cambridge offer an opportunity to assess what precisely the Saudis have bought into. And for less money, according to reports in the US, that the recent acquisition of Real Salt Lake by an investment group. Newcastle last won the FA Cup in 1955, with the list of those who have lifted the trophy since including Bolton, West Brom, Sunderland, Ipswich, Coventry, Wimbledon, Portsmouth and Wigan. Newcastle were last FA Cup semi-finalists in 2000. We are just five years short of the centenary of Newcastle’s last top-flight championship win. Newcastle have never won the League Cup; even Luton and Swindon have done that. There was glory in the Fairs Cup of 1969 and Intertoto Cup in 2006; one tournament long forgotten and another so pointless even Uefa ditched it. So much is continually made of Newcastle’s esteemed past and potential, but that is somewhat undermined by the club’s staggering lack of success. Still, people persist with the bizarre notion that Newcastle are destined for or ultra-worthy of glory. Other clubs, such as Leicester, actually deliver it. Supporters will blame Ashley’s frugality for recent struggles in the Premier League but statistics stretching back to the 1950s show top-flight top-five finishes the exception rather than the rule. “Newcastle United deserves to be top of the Premier League,” Staveley insisted in October. It was as legitimate then as it is now to ask what on earth that assertion is based on, save large attendance numbers that ultimately count for nothing much at all. Football leagues across the world include clubs with huge supporter bases who have encountered inexorable slides into oblivion. It seems safe to assume that kind of fate will not befall Newcastle. Saudi resources should at least see to that. Yet this is a club that gladly sold their soul to a pretty dubious regime, for benefits not thus far apparent. Had Ashley and Bruce been at the helm, defeat against Cambridge would have led to an incredible level of screaming and wailing. Instead, the Toon Army have no option but to keep the faith. Theirs is an unenviable position.",Sport/Football,Newcastle’s messy takeover fails to halt slide of club with lengthy history of failure | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/10/newcastles-messy-takeover-fails-to-halt-slide-of-club-with-lengthy-history-of-failure
1/10/2022,"At 10am last Thursday, Women Composers came on air and Hit the Dancefloor bit the dust. This new arrival among Scala Radio’s 20-strong family of digital niche stations is devoted entirely to classical music composed by women. Things began, however, not with a great fanfare (what a wonderful commission for a female composer that would have been) but with a bit of technical jiggery-pokery that meant knocking out one of Scala’s existing stations – farewell Hit the Dancefloor, a peculiar mixture of waltzes, ballets and galops (even a clog dance in its final hour) – and replacing it with the new Women Composers icon. The changeover took a few minutes, and the first piece to be played – the opening movement of Fanny Mendelssohn’s String Quartet in E Flat Major – was sadly not available to this listener, whose computer kept displaying an error message. But the second piece – Hildegard von Bingen’s Spiritus Sanctus Vivificans – was extremely uplifting, and the third, even better: a movement of Clara Schumann’s Piano Concerto in A Minor played by Isata Kanneh-Mason and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra.  And yet after this promising beginning, the new station opted for a day of mostly musical mush: the sort of ghostly, ghastly mood music that would not be amiss on Scala’s mindfulness station. Anne Nikitin’s Found God did not make me find God; Julianna Barwick’s Healing Is a Miracle was far from miraculous; Alexandra Hamilton-Ayres’s Coma did exactly what it said on the tin.On the plus side, there was some captivating piano: Oscar-winning film composer Rachel Portman’s A Gift made me want to hear more of her work; Marie Bigot’s Etude in A Minor was hugely polished; Maria Szymanowska’s Six Menuets wonderfully elegant. Like Clara Schumann, Bigot and Szymanowska were virtuoso pianists in the first half of the 19th century who also composed. Playing was seen as respectable for women; composition less so. When contemporaries heard a piece by “F Mendelssohn”, they invariably assumed her brother Felix rather than Fanny. A letter from her father has become infamous: “Perhaps for Felix music will become a profession, while for you it will always remain but an ornament.”  Scala’s premium stations – targeted at “music super fans” who pay £3.99 a month to get ad-free access – are a classic example of narrowcasting: there are stations for devotees of baroque or romantic music, there’s one that plays nothing but Mozart 24 hours a day, one that dishes up “dinner party” music, and a station that promises “classical bangers” which seems to play the Blue Danube a lot.  This is presenter-less radio, with lots of short pieces (three or four minutes on average) broken up by brief prerecorded statements: “Non-stop music from women composers” and “The only station that plays the best works by female composers 24 hours a day.” It is essentially a playlist, shuffled by computer with occasional human intervention. There are a lot of similar-sounding film scores and plenty of unthreatening piano, harp and guitar pieces. Think Enya crossed with Philip Glass: relaxation, mindfulness, the rhythm of a well-ordered life. Not much vocal music – too intrusive? The station’s computer prefers narcoleptic sopranos humming wordlessly.  Scala sets out to make classical music (what a knotty and unhelpful term that is) “accessible”, so you will not find many longer or more challenging pieces on the new station. Don’t expect Judith Weir, Sofia Gubaidulina or Hannah Kendall. The pieces align with what programme manager Jenny Nelson calls Scala’s “familiar sound world” – music that washes over you, gives pleasure, vaguely reminds you of something you saw and enjoyed on the telly.  Nelson sees Weir as “a Radio 3 composer”, and Clara Schumann, Anne Dudley and Portman as representative Scala composers. “Radio 3 is a brilliant station,” she says, “and people assume there’s a lot of crossover [with Scala] because of the term classical, but the overlap isn’t that great. One of the ideas we had when we started Scala was ‘What if Radio 2 did classical?’ It’s more that mindset that determines our music and editorial policy. There is some crossover, but there’ll be pieces we play that Radio 3 wouldn’t touch with a bargepole, and vice versa.”  Composer Julie Cooper, whose ethereal Secret Paths crops up a lot on the new station, insists the formulaic programming will not undermine its contribution to correcting the imbalance between male and female composers. “It really doesn’t matter from what genre they are playing works,” she says. “The most important thing is heightening awareness and giving visibility to women composers.” Scala has allied with the charity Donne, which campaigns to “readdress the gender inequality within the music industry”, to start this new station. Donne’s founder, Gabriella Di Laccio, believes an all-women station – even one with so limited a playlist – will demonstrate how many female composers, ancient and modern, there are. But she also accepts there is a danger of ghettoisation, and has some sympathy with those who reject the label “woman composer”. “We look forward to the day when there are just composers,” she says, “but we are not there yet and there is still a need to highlight women composers.”It is an interesting experiment, but surely Scala need to be braver. Subscribers have stumped up their £3.99 and aren’t your run-of-the-mill casual radio listeners – these are “music super fans”, remember? – so why not give them Weir, Gubaidulina and Kendall alongside Dudley and Portman? And programme some works that last longer than four minutes – the whole of Clara Schumann’s piano concerto for instance. Expand that sound world. Maybe start a station devoted to female serialists. Now that would be an adventure.

1/10/2022,"Just when you think everything is going right, along comes Carson Wentz. There was a wonky stat floating around on Sunday afternoon. It pointed out that Wentz, the Indianapolis Colts’ quarterback, was one game away from playing an entire season without throwing an interception on the road. It’s a neat stat. And it would be meaningful if Carson Wentz was not … Carson Wentz.  Ah, but Carson Wentz is Carson Wentz. Sunday afternoon’s 28-11 collapse in Jacksonville represented a full 10 on the Wentz-ing Scale. The quarterback threw two interceptions on two consecutive plays. He fumbled – again. One absurd sack followed the other. Misreads. Happy feet. Bad decisions. The works. Indianapolis entered Sunday with a simple playoff scenario ahead of them: Win and they were in. It was the same last week. They failed then. They failed on Sunday. It doesn’t get much easier than a Week 18 trip to the hapless Jags, a team with two wins on the season, ranked 31st in defensive efficiency, and with just seven turnovers all year – half as many as the second-lowest figure in the league. This was a Jacksonville team with nothing to play for except future contracts. It’s a team with a rookie quarterback, still trying to find his sea legs in a rudimentary offense. It was a game played in front of a hometown crowd that arrived, en masse, more interested in wearing clown wigs to roast their owner than the game itself. The Colts fell flat on their faces. They didn’t just lose, they were embarrassed. They were beaten up in the trenches for a second straight week – on both sides of the ball. Frank Reich, the team’s head coach and play-caller, shifted to a pass-centric approach, ditching the run game that had carried the team through its 6-1 midseason stretch. The ball was put in Wentz’s hands. Take us to the promised land. Even by the standards of the finest Wentz-ings, this was something special. More than any other high-level quarterback, you can feel Wentz’s indecision seeping through the screen. You can almost see the cogs churning. Should I throw this? I shouldn’t throw this. I’m not gonna throw this. Bleep. Did I just throw that? MY GODpic.twitter.com/Yge32azLBr Sunday’s performance had been coming. Barfing up turnovers is part of the whole Wentz Experience, he has just had an unusual amount of turnover look for extended stretches this season. ProFootballFocus, the NFL’s leading charting service, charted 16 “turnover worthy” throws from Wentz heading into Sunday, with over half of those coming on the road – and that might be a conservative figure. Against the Jaguars, he lodged his eighth fumble of this season, a career-low by his standards, but pushing still pushing his total number of turnovers for the season up to 14 – and his turnover-worthy plays closer to the mid-20s. A reminder: The Colts are still due to send the Eagles a first-round pick for Wentz in the upcoming draft. Wentz is also on the books for $28m next season, good for the 10th-largest cap hit of any player in the league. Indianapolis have built an excellent roster. It’s the kind that is tailor-built for a get-hot-for-a-month postseason run: A bruising offensive line; a young running back whose skill-set compliments one of the league’s most bountiful run games; playmakers at every level of the defense. On both sides of the ball, the Colts have smart coaches, all at the cutting edge of where the game is at and where it’s going. Then there’s the quarterback spot. The Colts bet that Reich’s innovative style could curb some of the quarterback’s baser instincts, that they could scheme around his flaws, hiding some of his decision-making issues with nifty play designs. They could handle the bad, they theorized, so long as it didn’t arrive at the worst time possible. They bet that they could navigate through the regular season, and that Wentz’s off-beat playmaking chops could be a difference-maker in a tight playoff game. On Sunday, that all went bust. Two weeks ago, the Colts had the look of a stealth contender. Now, they’re outside looking in, once again facing long-term questions about where they go as a franchise and what they do at quarterback. A 3rd and 9 QB sneak!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. What a 🤡 show pic.twitter.com/SyyL9AmYRL You saw that right. That’s the 4-12 Giants running a very obvious quarterback sneak on third-and-9 in the second quarter of a Week 18 game. I remind you: ESPN’s Adam Schefter has reported that Joe Judge will be back as head coach for the 2022 season. Judge has weaponized his special blend of rah-rah nonsense to such a degree that Giants owner John Mara has claimed he sees something of the Bill Belichick or Bill Parcells in the young coach. The video above – and reality itself – would indicate otherwise. There is no franchise that will head into the offseason in a deeper hole than the Giants. Dan Campbell, head coach, Detroit Lions. The Fighting Dan Campbells emptied the playbook against the Packers to hand Detroit a 34-31 win. The Lions ran an assortment of trick plays to bring some much-needed oomph to a ropey offense. Entering the day, the Lions held the first overall pick in the upcoming draft. The win dropped them to second, with the Jags leaping into the first spot. It’s been a tough year for Campbell, but a win on Sunday was the kind that can give a franchise and its fan-base hope heading into the offseason. The roots of something are there – a tough, physical style, with some creative schematic designs on both sides of the ball. Like all bad teams, the Lions are a quarterback away. But quarterback aside, the foundations of a good team are there. Thirty years. We have a doozy for you this week: No human in history has ever sent a text message about the Bengals winning a playoff game. The Bengals last playoff win: 1991. The first text message that was ever sent: 1992. The Bengals head to the playoffs for the first time since the Andy Dalton-Marvin Lewis-AJ Green axis led the franchise to three painstaking defeats in a row. This time, the Bengals enter the postseason with Sleeper Contender status. Cincinnati have all the ingredients: They’re second in the league in explosive play rate on offense; they have the league’s best deep threat; they have a funky defensive scheme; they can rush the quarterback with four; in Joe Burrow, they have one of the league’s finest third-down creators. The only thing holding the Bengals back: Their head coach’s game management. The Bengals will face the Raiders in the wild-card round next week. If they’re able to beat Rich Bisaccia and co in Cincinnati, you best believe the 5G will be working overtime in Ohio. “Those other three teams have top-shelf quarterbacks, which is obvious to everybody.” – Vic Fangio on what separates the Broncos from the rest of the AFC West The NFL’s coaching carousel is already up and running. The Broncos fired Fangio on Sunday morning following Saturday night’s 28-24 loss to the Chiefs and three losing seasons. On his way out the door, Fangio offered a timely reminder to prospective head coach candidates to not jump to a head coaching job for the sake of the moniker. It’s about picking the right job. And the right job means picking the right quarterback. Fangio’s days as a head coach are likely over, but he immediately vaults to the top of the defensive coordinator power rankings. Denver, with a shaky ownership situation and dodgy quarterback room – in a loaded division – is unlikely to be at the top of the list for any of the most sought-after head coaching candidates. The Broncos’ ideal plan would be to swing a coach-quarterback double-deal, tempting Aaron Rodgers away from Green Bay with the quarterback bringing a coach of his choosing along for the ride. The Broncos have a talented core, and their reputation for organizational competence will see them land one of this carousel’s top names. But the job will only be as good as the team’s ability to find a quarterback in the offseason.  The show goes on. Ben Roethlisberger completed a fourth-down pass in overtime to set up a game-winning field to earn the Steelers a spot in the playoffs. Roethlisberger’s goodbye will have to wait at least another week. Kudos to the Ravens, though. In a delightful bit of petty, Baltimore showed a video ‘tribute’ to Roethlisberger during a late-game timeout, in which they showed nothing but highlights and headlines of the quarterback getting sacked or losing. That’s how you do a rivalry.  The Niners rallied back from 17-3 down at the half to beat the Rams 27-24 in overtime to secure a spot in the playoffs. Jimmy Garoppolo delivered a pair of clutch drives to first extend the game and then give the Niners the lead in overtime. A late Matthew Stafford interception sealed the win and a playoff berth for San Francisco.  The road to the Super Bowl in the AFC will go through Tennessee. The Titans wrapped up the number one seed in the AFC with a 28-25 win over the Texans. With the win, Tennessee secured the all-important (and sole) bye week, which will give Derrick Henry an added week of rest before he returns to the fold. It’s hard to overstate the importance of the win for the Titans. They have, for the most part, been a mess on offense without Henry, ranking 28th in the league in EPA per play since Henry fell out of the line-up. With Henry, the Titans have championship upside.  The Cowboys rediscovered their offensive bluster on Saturday night as Dak Prescott threw for 295 yards and five touchdowns. Dallas’ star-driven vehicle has looked sluggish for much of the second half of the season. But Prescott et al re-found their early-season magic over course of the last three weeks, just in time for the playoffs. The Cowboys’ blend of offensive efficiency and the playmaking chops they bring on defense is tough to match anywhere in the NFC.  NFL Network reports that the Seahawks have no plans to trade Russell Wilson in the offseason, though whether Wilson has plans of his own remains unknown. Seattle are staring down a choice between bringing back Pete Carroll and the team’s personnel czar or bringing back Wilson. NFL Network reports that a “mutual” parting of the ways between Carroll and the Seahawks is, at this stage, the likeliest outcome.  As expected, Matt Nagy is out in Chicago. The Bears job has a solid foundation – a young, talented quarterback; gifted players at every level of the defense – but it’s unlikely to be at the top of any candidate’s list. Justin Fields is a sound starting point, but the rest of the offense needs more than a schematic facelift. While the defense has started to age and creak, with several pieces of the defensive core are set to age out of their prime, hit free agency, or are likely to be cap casualties this offseason.  Mike Zimmer is expected to be out in Minnesota, too. The Vikings head into an offseason in which they have $40m in guaranteed money (yes, really) tied up in Kirk Cousins. That would represent the third-highest cap hold of any player in the league. The Vikings ditching Zimmer might be an attempt at a soft reboot, grabbing an offensive-minded coach to try to squeeze more out of the Cousins-led offense. Alternatively, the Vikings can trade Cousins before the draft and save themselves $30m, punting on the whole Zimmer-Cousins era and starting afresh.  Save the best for last, and all that. The Chargers and Raiders eschewed the much-discussed Kneel-Down Bowl in favor of playing out the Game of the Year. On a tense, back-and-forth night, the Raiders wound up the 35-32 winners, setting up a wild-card tie against the Bengals. It was an extraordinary night in Vegas, featuring a performance for the ages from Justin Herbert and a wonky late-game timeout from Brandon Staley that essentially cost the Chargers a playoff spot. With the Raiders running out the clock for a tie in overtime – a result that would have sent both teams to the playoffs – Staley took a timeout to try to force a stop on third down. The Raiders picked up the first down, kicked a game-winning field goal, and dumped the Chargers from the playoff.  There haven’t been many more impressive coaching jobs than what Rich Bisaccia has done with Las Vegas. Bisaccia guided the Raiders through controversy and tragedy, distractions and adversity. Let’s not get it twisted: The Raiders are liable to be one-and-done in the playoffs. They were fortunate during the second half of the season. After losing five out of six, they drew three straight games against a backup quarterback (Drew Lock), an injured quarterback (Baker Mayfield), and a sick quarterback (Carson Wentz). They won those games by a combined nine points. Still: Bisaccia deserves credit for keeping the train on the tracks in what has been an unusually tumultuous season.",Sport/Sport,Carson Wentz’s epic meltdown throws the Colts’ whole future into doubt,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/carson-wentz-indianapolis-colts-jaguars-disaster
1/10/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the economy is “obviously” taking a hit from the Omicron wave of the pandemic, while Labor is warning that mismanaging health outcomes will make the situation worse. As the country recorded another 71,000 cases nationally on Monday, Morrison said it was “understandable” that the Omicron variant was affecting the economy, but he was hopeful of a strong rebound.  “At this stage, it is a bit too early to tell (the economic impact), but there’s obviously been a dampening impact on consumer demand – I think that’s fairly obvious and understandable,” Morrison said. “But what we’ve seen so many times is that when you, it’s a bit like when you’ve come out of lockdown, you see the economy surge back quite quickly.” Morrison said that businesses enduring workforce shortages and disruptions to supply chains were experiencing “a tough time”. “As the case numbers continue to rise, the volume of cases will of course have an inevitable impact on the workforce,” the prime minister told reporters in Canberra on Monday. “This is an incredibly tough time on business. There aren’t lockdowns but there are many people obviously impacted by being close contacts or people being wary, or those indeed who have Covid themselves.” Morrison made the remarks while unveiling changes to isolation requirements for workers in the food manufacturing and distribution sectors, which have been hit by workforce shortages of more than 40%. Spending surveys released by the ANZ bank last week showed consumer spending was once more down to lockdown levels, as workers were isolated, businesses shut down, and consumers stayed home. But despite the grim figures, Morrison pointed to figures released on Monday showing Australians are, on average, 45 months ahead of their monthly mortgage repayments, with $222bn in offset accounts, up from $174bn in March 2020.

They’re making their choices. They’re ensuring they’re getting their financial position in as strong a position it can be to get through this pandemic.” But the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, criticised the government for failing to manage the easing of restrictions and preparing for the spread of the virus. “What we know is that if you don’t get the health outcomes right, the adverse impact on the economy will be stronger,” Albanese said. “We are seeing that around the country, we’re seeing that with workers unable to attend work, with shortages on our supermarket shelves. “We need to deal with the health issues first, and that will lead to a better economy, more jobs being able to be undertaken. A more normal way of life, including children being back at school, is what everyone wants.” The mid-year budget update in December warned of a potential downside scenario that could arise after an outbreak of a new variant, which would result in a significant government response including lockdowns. In this scenario, economic activity would be around $20bn lower in 2021-22, wiping 1 percentage point off GDP in 2021-22 and hiking unemployment up by 1%.",News/Australia news,‘Tough times’: Scott Morrison says economy ‘obviously’ taking a hit from Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/10/tough-times-scott-morrison-says-economy-obviously-taking-a-hit-from-omicron
1/10/2022,"There are many ways to get some winter heat into your bones. Some countries swear by saunas; others partake of hot springs or sweat lodges. In Britain, however, there is an alternative that doesn’t involve taking your clothes off: the tropical hothouse. Early practitioners of hothouse horticulture faced formidable obstacles: in the 15th century, alchemist George Ripley suffered death for making a pear tree, “fructify in winter”. It was Victorian gardeners, however, who really triumphed, erecting massive structures and growing rarities like pineapples, bananas and even papayas. Not that things always went smoothly, the Palm House at Kew was opened in 1848, but the curators had managed to kill many of the specimens by 1895 (tinted green glass was a bad idea). Since then, science has ironed out many problems and green technology powers a new wave of fine, steamy hothouses around the country. In addition, some of our best Victorian hothouses have been significantly modernised while keeping the original look.  Some of the projects begun at the millennium were immediately appreciated: bridges and domes, for example. Others, however, had to wait for plants to mature and are only now reaching their best, among them a fine pair of glasshouses in the National Botanic Garden of Wales. The larger of the two features plants from Mediterranean climates, about 2% of the Earth’s surface, but containing a fifth of the flowering plants found in locations as far apart as South Africa, the Canaries and Croatia. With the temperature generally in the 20s, this is a balmy stroll through the world’s best wine-growing regions. In a couple of minutes you can walk from Australia to Chile. If you’re still a bit chilly, head over to the tropical house, where a biomass boiler keeps things comfortably steamy all year, with bananas and pineapples surrounded by vanilla and strelitzia. The gardens outside were once a famed Regency water garden and, after a £7m restoration, are well worth exploring too.Winter entry: 10am-4pm (last entry 3pm), adult £12.50 The epitome of all hothouses is still one of the best. Pride of place goes to the oldest pot plant in the world, the Eastern Cape cycad. Collected in South Africa in 1775, it was sailed back to London where it is currently relaxing after producing a single cone, in 1819. Other specimens include rubber trees, oil palms and cacao trees. If things get too warm, head across to the larger Temperate House, another Grade I-listed marvel. Opened in 1863 and totally refurbished in 2018, it features more than 1,500 species of plant from frost-free regions, including six that are extinct in the wild. One of the rarest trees is another cycad that was moved from the Palm House in 1997 and celebrated by producing a cone in 2004. The tree is actually a cutting taken in 1899 from its only surviving relative, a specimen that grows in Durban’s botanic gardens.Winter entry: 10am-3pm (last entry 2pm), adult £11 Another fine addition to Britain’s hothouse collection was erected to celebrate 200 years of the Royal Horticultural Society in 2007. Highlights include insect-eating pitcher plants, ginger flowers, some rainforest giant trees and an Ethiopian black banana. With waterfalls and three different climate zones, the glasshouse manages to pack a lot into an area the size of 10 tennis courts with a 12-metre-high roof. The temperature is never allowed below a summery 20C, with humidity about 70%.Winter entry: 10am-3.15pm (last entry 3pm), adult £14.95 or free to RHS members A gem of Victorian engineering, the Belfast palm house was started in 1839, but things really got moving towards the end of the 19th century, when local gardener Charles McKimm took over. He built up great collections of orchids, chrysanthemums and bananas, and added the wonderful tropical ravine, a multi-level fernery that was twice extended to include a waterfall and a lily pond. In 2018 a major £3.8m refurbishment, included triple glazing and a lift, but also restored many original features that had been lost. Now it’s a delightful mix of old grottoes and new viewing platforms, plus lots of tree ferns, bromeliads and orchids.Winter entry: 10am-3.45pm, free One of Britains oldest and finest hothouses, Sheffield Botanical Gardens opened in 1836 and seem to have been fighting for survival ever since. Repeated cycles of underinvestment and failure were brought to an end with more than £5m of Heritage Lottery funding plus hefty local financial input, allowing the complete refurbishment of its three magnificent pavilions and the rebuilding of the connecting glass walkways. Replanted in 2003, it is now reaching maturity with tree ferns, various palms and some spectacular flowers – the gymea lily from New Zealand sent up a six-metre flower stem last year. The layout gives you a nice long stroll through the world’s hot zones at a guaranteed minimum of 10C.Winter entry: 10am-4pm weekends, 8am-4pm week days, free If the word “hothouse” conjures up visions of steamy verdure, think again. Birmingham’s botanical gardens include an “arid house” that features desert-dwelling plants such as cacti, euphorbias and agave, all kept at a temperature that never drops below 7C. Opened in 1884, it was the third of three large glasshouses; the others feature subtropical and tropical plants. It was in the latter pavilion that two separate tree ferns, one from St Helena and another from Tasmania, got together and produced a hybrid, dicksonia x lathamii, the only one of its kind in the world and now over a century old. There is also a Wollemi Pine, one of the oldest species on the planet, discovered in 1994.Winter entry: 10am-5pm (last entry 4.30pm), adult £7.50 The history of Glasgow’s beautiful hothouses is almost as bizarre as some of its floral inhabitants. The giant glass dome was first built by the eccentric John Kibble in 1865, then transported by barge to its current site, where it hosted concerts, religious revivals and political rallies before settling down to housing a fine collection of tropical plants close to the heart of the city. It was fully restored in 2006. Specialities include carnivorous plants, orchids and tree ferns. (Edinburgh’s glasshouse is currently under restoration.)Winter entry: 12 noon-4pm, free Opened in 2001, Eden’s interlinked plastic domes are hitting their stride in terms of plant growth these days, with about 5,000 species represented, covering climates from steamy to arid and Mediterranean. The rainforest really does capture the atmosphere of the original, down to jungle birds running around the jungle floor. Plants such as cacao, coffee and rubber tell the economic story of the tropics too.Winter entry: 10am-4pm week days, 9.30am-6pm weekends, adult £29.50 One of the world’s first large glasshouses and still one of the most beautiful, Bicton’s palm house utilises 18,000 glass panels in a sensuous curving design that was completed in 1830. Nearby, the tropical house is home to the Bicton orchid, named after the place where it first bloomed, in 1836. There are also arid and temperate houses.Winter entry: 10am-4.30pm, adult £12.95 As a working garden for Cambridge’s botany department, this horticultural gem has the responsibility for around 8,000 species, and as you might expect, its seven habitats in a glasshouse range offer an education in themselves. Explore themes such as convergent evolution, carnivorous plant diversity and continental drift as you walk from tropical heat through arid zones and into mountainous climates. Among 73 highly endangered species is the titan arum, which throws up a three-metre-tall flower every seven years.Winter entry: 10am-4pm (last entry 3.30pm), adult £7.50",Lifestyle/Travel,10 of the UK’s best botanical hothouses for a winter warm-up,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/10/10-best-uk-botanical-hothouses-winter-warm-up
