4/29/2022,"Shares of Amazon (AMZ) dropped after the company revealed a revenue forecast that missed analyst estimates as consumers curb online spending in the face of economic uncertainty and a return to in-person activities. The company also reported a loss on its investment in electric-vehicle maker Rivian Automotive. The e-commerce giant was the last of Big Tech names to unveil quarterly earnings this reporting season. The tech behemoth’s cloud-computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) was a bright spot during a lackluster quarter, but revenue failed to offset weakness in the company's core retail business. Amazon's stock lost nearly 10% in post-market trading as investors weighed the results. Here were the main metrics from Amazon's report, compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg: Revenue: $116.4 billion vs. $116.43 billion expected Earnings per share: $7.56 per share vs. $8.40 per share expected Amazon’s net sales came in at $116.4 billion in the first quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $116.43 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The figure marks a revenue increase of 7%, compared to a 44% increase in the same period last year, marking the company's slowest growth rate in more than two decades. The company reported a net loss of $3.8 billion in the first quarter, or $7.56 per share, compared Bloomberg estimates of $8.40 per share. In the same period last year, Amazon logged a net income of $8.1 billion, or $15.79 per share. Amazon attributed its net loss for the first quarter of 2022 to a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion from its investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN). “The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. ""Today, as we’re no longer chasing physical or staffing capacity, our teams are squarely focused on improving productivity and cost efficiencies throughout our fulfillment network,"" he added. ""This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a number of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we’re now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020.” Amazon also projected second quarter sales below Wall Street estimates. The online retailer forecast revenue of $116 billion and $121 billion for the period ending June 30, compared to the $125.01 billion analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected. Shares of Amazon have been a laggard among mega-cap technology stocks since last year when the company saw its robust year-over-year growth rates begin to fade following an impressive 2020 driven by a pandemic-stoked surge in online shopping. Investment bank Cowen, which recently trimmed its forecast, said in a recent note that supply chain issues, could present a risk to its expectations for the company they continue to persist into the year. While performance in Amazon’s retail business was lackluster, sales for the company's high-margin cloud computing business AWS increased 36.7% year-over-year to $18.44 billion. Adding to inflationary pressures was a slew of labor challenges for the company. In addition to a tight labor market driving wage expenses higher, employees at more than 100 U.S.-based Amazon facilities have pushed ahead with unionizing efforts at their workplaces since a historic union victory at a warehouse on Staten Island in New York earlier this month. For Bank of America, Amazon remains its top FANG stock for 2022 despite recent challenges. The institution specifically cited AWS strength, as well as an opportunity to improve margins from trailing 12-month lows. ""Inflation clouds the 2022 margin recovery story, but Amazon remains our top FANG stock.” This post is breaking.

4/29/2022,"Fed Chair Jerome Powell has made it clear: The central bank is done sitting on the sidelines as inflation chips away at the value of the dollar. The plan? Put upward pressure on interest rates until price growth relents. Historically speaking, that inflation fighting playbook is particularly hard-felt in the housing market, where spiking mortgage rates can quickly price out homebuyers. That's already starting to happen. On Thursday, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hit 5.11%—up from 3.11% in December. A borrower who took out a $500,000 mortgage at a 3.11% rate would owe $2,138 per month. At a 5.11% rate, that monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage spikes to $2,718. While the swift move up in mortgage rates is undoubtedly putting downward pressure on the housing market, it doesn't mean home prices are about to crash. In fact, every major real estate firm with a publicly released forecast model, including Fannie Mae and Zillow, still predicts home prices will climb further this year. That said, industry insiders tell Fortune there's increasingly a chance that the economic shock caused by soaring mortgage rates could see home values fall in some overpriced housing markets. To better understand which regional housing markets might see a price decline, Fortune reached out to CoreLogic. The California-based real estate research company provided us with its assessment of close to 400 metropolitan statistical areas. CoreLogic, which ranks No. 952 on the Fortune 1000, put housing markets into one of five categories based on the likelihood that home prices in that particular market are to fall over the coming 12 months. Here are those groupings: Elevated: Over 40% chance of a price dip High: 30–40% chance Medium: 20–30% chance Low: 10–20% chance Very Low: 0–10% chance View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Among the 392 regional housing markets that CoreLogic measured, it puts 86% into the ""very low"" or ""low"" likelihood of a price decline. It put 10% of markets into the ""medium"" grouping and 1% in the ""high"" grouping. Meanwhile, CoreLogic places only 2% of markets into the ""elevated"" group. The markets in the elevated grouping—the highest odds of a price correction—include Hartford; Kalamazoo; Lewiston, Maine; Mount Vernon, Wash.; Muskegon, Mich.; Olympia, Wash.; Salem, Ore.; and Honolulu. Even in the face of soaring mortgage rates, CoreLogic still thinks the chances of prices declining in 2022 are fairly low. Why? The real estate research firm points to the mismatch between inventory and strong buyer demand. That's also reflected in its national forecast. Over the coming 12 months, CoreLogic predicts U.S. home prices are poised to rise 5%. That'd mark a deceleration from the 19.8% jump posted over the past 12 months, but it's hardly the relief priced-out buyers are seeking. However, that doesn't mean CoreLogic views the ongoing housing market boom as healthy. CoreLogic also calculated whether local income levels could support local home prices. The finding? CoreLogic says 65% of U.S. regional housing markets are ""overvalued."" That includes every major market in states like Arizona, Florida, and Texas. Just 9% of regional housing markets are what CoreLogic deems ""undervalued""; 26% get its ""normal"" label. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Not long after the strict COVID-19 lockdowns let up in 2020, the housing market began to boom. Economists at the time weren't worried. In their eyes, the demographic wave of first-time millennial homebuyers, the influx of work-from-home buyers, and low mortgage rates all supported the price boom. In recent months, however, their tune has shifted. Just last month, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas published a paper warning that a housing bubble could be brewing. Meanwhile, last week housing economist George Ratiu proclaimed that “we’re not in a housing bubble just yet—but we’re skating close to one if prices continue rising at the current pace."" Increasingly, industry insiders are rooting for spiking mortgage rates to rein in the unsustainable levels of home price growth. That includes Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire. He'd like to see soaring mortgage rates cause some homebuyers to pause their search. If that happens, inventory could finally get the breathing room it needs to rise again. ""It's too many people chasing too few homes; we desperately need a breather,"" Mohtashami says. If you’re hungry for more housing data, follow me on Twitter at @NewsLambert.

4/29/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Bond manager Mark Kiesel sold his California home in 2006, when he presciently predicted the housing bubble would pop. He bought again in 2012, after U.S. prices fell more than 30% and found a floor. Most Read from Bloomberg Four European Gas Buyers Made Ruble Payments to Russia Putin Is Losing So Here’s How He’ll Make the War Worse U.S. Economy Posts Surprise Contraction, Belying Solid Consumer Picture A Powerful Dynasty Bankrupted Sri Lanka in Just 30 Months Amazon’s Twitch Seeks to Revamp Creator Pay With Focus on Profit Now, after a record surge in prices, Kiesel says the time to sell is once again at hand. Sky-high values, soaring interest rates and other costs of homeownership -- maintenance, property taxes and utilities -- dampen prospects for future appreciation, according to Kiesel, chief investment officer for global credit at Pacific Investment Management Co. He’s weighing putting his Orange County house on the market and becoming a renter rather than an owner. “I can look at my long-term 25-year charts and they tell me when to buy and sell and they’re flashing orange right now,” Kiesel, 52, said during an interview at Pimco’s Newport Beach, California, headquarters. “I think we’re in the final innings.” Home prices soared almost 20% in the 12 months through February, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index, as pandemic moves, low borrowing costs and a dearth of inventory spurred heated competition for housing. But the market is now facing the fastest rise in mortgage rates in decades as the Federal Reserve works to tamp down inflation. The average 30-year rate is now 5.1%, close to a 12-year high, Freddie Mac data show. Home sales contracts, a leading indicator, fell for the fifth consecutive month in March as rising borrowing costs added to affordability pressures, the National Association of Realtors reported on Wednesday. Prophetic Choices Kiesel’s possible sale is a personal move and not a forecast of a crash by Pimco, which in March put out a note predicting “No Bust After the Boom” following years of housing undersupply. “Estimates of this secular shortage range from two to five million houses,” according to the authors. Related: Pimco’s Kiesel Says Cash Position at 10%-12%, Cuts Credit Risk But Kiesel’s past personal decisions have proved prophetic. He sold his Newport Beach house in May 2006, calling housing “the next Nasdaq bubble.” Home prices peaked that year before going on to plunge, triggering the global financial crisis. “It’s not just houses that will be for sale,” Kiesel said in a June 2006 interview. “You’re going to see financial assets for sale over time, and ultimately corporate bonds.” Then in May 2012, Kiesel decided it was time to own again, buying a golf course-adjacent home. “For those of you renting or on the sidelines, I recommend you at least consider getting ‘back in’ and buying a house,” he wrote in a credit market note. “The future is hard to predict, but U.S. housing is healing and is probably close to a bottom.” ‘Max 2% Return’ U.S. housing prices have more than doubled in the past decade and the house Kiesel bought for $2.9 million in 2012 now has an estimated value of $5.5 million, according to Redfin Corp. Buying a home in today’s market would likely yield about a 2% return, Kiesel said. He considers his home as an investment, refusing to form an emotional attachment to his property. “It’s only a good investment if you buy it the right time,” he said. “If I were to buy a house today, I would probably get max 2% return on it. And I can find other things I can make money on other than a house.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek An Entire Neighborhood Is Being Flipped by a Los Angeles Developer The 400 Airplanes That Russia Seized Have Become an Epic Insurance Struggle China’s Biggest Covid Failure Is Not Deploying an mRNA Vaccine China’s Campaign to Wipe Out Covid Is Crushing Its Economy Bill Hwang Had $20 Billion, Then Lost It All in Two Days ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•5 hours ago,Investor Who Called Housing Top and Bottom Says It's Time to Sell,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pimco-kiesel-called-housing-top-160339396.html
4/29/2022,"Apple (AAPL) reported its Q2 2022 earnings after the bell Thursday, beating analysts expectations on the top and bottom line and recording record revenue despite continued supply chain disruptions. Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue: $97.3 billion versus $93.98 billion expected Adjusted EPS: $1.52 versus $1.42 expected iPhone revenue: $50.57 billion versus $49.16 billion expected Mac revenue: $10.44 billion versus $9.23 billion expected iPad revenue: $7.65 billion versus $7.19 billion expected Wearables revenue: $8.81 billion versus $8.98 billion expected Services revenue: $19.82 billion versus $19.78 billion expected Apple shares were mostly flat following the report. “This quarter’s record results are a testament to Apple’s relentless focus on innovation and our ability to create the best products and services in the world,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. “We are delighted to see the strong customer response to our new products, as well as the progress we’re making to become carbon neutral across our supply chain and our products by 2030. We are committed, as ever, to being a force for good in the world — both in what we create and what we leave behind,” Cook said. Apple’s report comes amid a mixed bag of tech earnings in which companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Meta (FB) have fallen short of expectations, while firms like Microsoft (MSFT) managed to surpass Wall Street estimates. Apple largely avoided falling victim to supply chain disruptions throughout the pandemic. In Q1, the company smashed Wall Street expectations, though CEO Tim Cook did say supply chain problems negatively impacted iPad availability. CFO Luca Maestri, meanwhile, indicated that the iPhone and Mac product lines were also dealing with supply chain issues. Beyond its quarterly performance, Apple continues to contend with regulatory pressure related to its App Store both in the U.S. and abroad. The European Union is rolling out new legislation that could force Apple to allow app developers to offer their own payment methods via their apps, which could impact the company’s Services business. The U.S. is also considering similar regulations, though Congress is much further behind in the process of putting the proposed law into effect.

4/29/2022,"Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said Wednesday that the aerospace giant lost $660 million in the first quarter on the project building new presidential jets. Former President Donald Trump in 2018 famously renegotiated the contract for the pair of 747s, which are referred to as Air Force One when the president is on board. The new agreement established a fixed-price contract worth $3.9 billion, placing all the risks of cost overruns on Boeing. “Air Force One — I'm just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken,” Calhoun said in an earnings call. The company now expects to lose about $1.1 billion on the Air Force One project. “We took some risks not knowing that Covid would arrive and not knowing that inflation would take hold like it has - and both of those have impacted us fairly severely,"" Calhoun said. “But we are where we are, and we're going to deliver great airplanes.” The first presidential 747 was scheduled to be delivered in 2024, but now is not expected until 2026.

4/29/2022,"Can I retire at 55? It’s a question you might be asking yourself if you’re hoping to make an early exit from the workforce. While normal retirement age for most people usually means 65 or older, early retirement could give you more time to do things you enjoy or explore new interests. But it’s important to build a solid financial foundation before leaving your day job behind. Running the numbers can help with deciding if retiring at 55 is a realistic goal. A financial advisor can help you get a realistic estimate of when you may be prepared to retire. There’s nothing in the retirement rulebook that says you can’t retire at 55 years old. In fact, some members of the FIRE (financial independence, retire early) movement aim to retire as early as 40. So it’s perfectly legal to retire in your mid-50s if that’s your goal. But it’s important to keep in mind that retiring at 55 isn’t the norm for most people. If you’re going by the normal retirement age prescribed by Social Security, for example, that usually means waiting until you’re 66 or 67. And some seniors may choose to delay retirement to their 70s or simply keep working indefinitely. Don't miss out on news that could impact your finances.

Social Security retirement benefits can be an important part of your financial puzzle. These benefits are designed to provide monthly income in addition to any income you have from qualified retirement accounts, taxable investment accounts, annuities or other sources. So can you retire at 55 and collect Social Security? The answer, unfortunately, is no. The earliest age to begin drawing Social Security retirement benefits is 62. But there’s a catch. Taking Social Security benefits prior to reaching your normal retirement age results in a reduction of your benefit amount. Your benefits can also be reduced if you start taking them at age 62 but are still working in some capacity. So, say you retire at 55 from your full-time job but you want to do some consulting work on the side. Once you turn 62, you could claim Social Security retirement benefits but your earnings from consulting work could affect how much you collect. The flip side to Social Security is that you can be rewarded with a larger benefit amount by waiting to claim them. If you wait until age 70 to take Social Security, for example, you can receive a monthly payment that’s equal to 132% of your regular benefit amount. So if you’re asking, can I retire at 55? it’s important to know that you won’t have Social Security as a source of income for a few years. And that if you decide to take those benefits as soon as you’re able to, they’ll be less than what you’d get if you waited until full retirement age instead. Saving money in a 401(k) and/or Individual Retirement Account can help to fund your early retirement goals. But you may run into a snag when trying to take money from those accounts before age 59 ½. First, there’s the Rule of 55. This IRS rule says that if you get fired, laid off or quit your job in the year that you turn 55 you can withdraw money from your current 401(k) or 403(b) without a penalty. But you still wouldn’t be able to tap any money in 401(k) plans you had at former employers without a penalty before age 59 ½. The only way to work around this would be rolling your old 401(k) or 403(b) into your current one before you retire. If you have a traditional IRA, you generally can’t take money out of it before age 59 ½ without a penalty unless you qualify for certain exceptions. With a Roth IRA, you can always withdraw your original contributions tax- and penalty-free. But to do that, the account must have been open for at least five years beforehand. Otherwise, you’ll need to wait until age 59 ½ to withdraw earnings without a penalty unless you qualify for an exception. This means you’ll need to have savings and investments outside of these plans you can tap. An online brokerage account could be a good place to start. But remember that selling investments at a profit can trigger capital gains tax. You could also supplement a brokerage account with regular savings accounts, money market accounts, cash value life insurance or an annuity. Annuities can provide a steady stream of income in early retirement. This type of insurance contract allows you to pay a premium to the insurer. This allows you to collect regular monthly payments later beginning at a date you choose. An annuity is something you might consider if you want a backup source of income until you’re eligible to withdraw money from qualified accounts or claim Social Security benefits. Planning to retire at 55 is different from planning to retire at 65 or older for one very important reason: You’ll need more money to last you through your old age. If you were to retire at 65 and live to age 90, your money would need to last 25 years. But if you’re retiring at age 55 instead, your savings now needs to be able to stretch for 35 years. And that assumes you stay healthy and don’t require long-term care at some point, which could significantly drain your assets. So how much money do you need to retire at 55? The short answer is that it depends on the type of lifestyle you want to have. If you plan to scale back and live a very minimalist lifestyle that allows you to keep expenses low then you may be fine with less money. On the other hand, you may need a larger nest egg if your early retirement plans include traveling, buying a home or starting a business. When preparing a budget to retire at 55, consider: Your current monthly expenses What you estimate your expenses would be if you were to retire early How long you expect to live in retirement What your main income sources will be before you’re eligible for Social Security benefits or to make penalty-free withdrawals from a 401(k) or IRA How much you currently have saved outside of a 401(k) or IRA How long you have to save and invest until age 55 Pinpointing a specific number to aim or gets easier when you take time to answer these questions. For example, you may be wondering if it's possible to retire at 55 on $500,000 or $1 million. Or you may think $2 million is closer to the mark. Using some basic rules of thumb can help you come up with an answer. For example, a commonly accepted piece of retirement planning advice suggests have seven times your annual income saved by age 55. So if you make $100,000 a year, you'd need $700,000 saved by your 55th birthday. But that's only part of the equation. You also have to figure out how long that $700,000 will last and how much more you may need to save, based on your estimated retirement budget. One expense you can’t afford to overlook when retiring at 55 is healthcare. Medicare can pay for certain healthcare expenses in retirement but you won’t be eligible to enroll until the year you turn 65. So that leaves a 10-year gap in which you’ll need to make other plans for paying healthcare expenses. Your options for paying for health may include: COBRA coverage Purchasing coverage through the healthcare marketplace Enrolling in a spouse’s plan Healthcare sharing Going without insurance In terms of cost, COBRA coverage may be the most expensive option, depending on the type of plan offered by your employer. Getting covered under a spouse’s plan could be the most cost-effective way to manage healthcare costs until you’re Medicare-eligible. But if you’re unmarried or your spouse isn’t covered this may not be an option. You’ll also need to consider how long-term care needs might affect your plans to retire at 55. Long-term care can easily siphon away thousands of dollars a year from your savings. While you could qualify for Medicaid to help pay for these costs, that usually requires spending down some of your assets first. A Medicaid asset protection trust could help you to avoid that scenario. Talking to your financial advisor or an estate planning attorney can help you decide if it’s right for you. Retiring at 55 is something of a lofty goal but it’s achievable with the right financial plan in place. When considering early retirement, remember that it can affect how much you need to save and where you’ll need to keep those savings. Also, consider what types of investment vehicles or planning tools, such as annuities or cash value life insurance, could help with reaching your goals. Consider talking with a financial advisor about how to make retiring at 55 a reality. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors in your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.
