3/3/2022,"A police officer charged with murder has told a court that an Aboriginal man put a hand on his gun and then appeared to repeatedly stab his colleague during the fatal incident. Zachary Rolfe continued his evidence in the Northern Territory supreme court on Thursday. Rolfe shot Kumanjayi Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, the court previously heard. The court previously heard Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, had stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the first shot was fired. Rolfe is not charged in relation to this shot. He is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued his actions on the day were justified in light of the risk that Walker posed to him and a colleague, the then-constable Adam Eberl. Rolfe told the court on Thursday that his recollection of the night was that almost immediately after he had asked Walker to put his hands behind his back he started to resist. He said Walker started to strike him with his right arm, in a downward motion, and he thought it was “strange” Walker was not using his knuckles as he raised his left arm and left shoulder to protect his neck. He said that at this time he noticed Walker had a “metal blade” in his right hand, and that he was stabbed in the top of his shoulder as he had his left arm extended. He said that soon after he jabbed Walker with his left fist to his face. Rolfe told the court that as he raised his left arm he also instinctively reached for his Glock handgun with his right hand, and he noticed Walker had his left hand on the weapon. He said he then twisted his hips back with speed to knock Walker’s hand from the gun, and then stepped back, at which time he said Walker’s attention turned to Eberl. Rolfe said that he feared for Eberl’s life and soon after drew and fired his gun for the first time. He noticed the shot had hit Walker, but believed the shot had “not at all” incapacitated him. Soon after, Rolfe said he saw the pair fall to the ground, where they continued to fight. He said he saw Walker’s body behind Eberl, with both men facing the same direction. He told the court he believed he could see Walker’s right arm moving and repeatedly stabbing Eberl – who he knew was not wearing body armour – in the chest region. Eberl was found to have a minor scratch near his left armpit after the struggle, but he told the court during an earlier hearing he could recall it being caused by Walker. Rolfe said that he then walked across the room to the pair, placed his hand on Eberl to ensure he did not move back into his line of fire during the struggle, and shot Walker twice more in the side of his body. At the time, he said he feared for Eberl’s life, and that he had been trained to use his forearm in such situations. “I believed he could have been seriously wounded or potentially suffered a fatal stab wound in that fight,” he said.

3/3/2022,"The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack submitted a sealed court filing Wednesday evening to challenge former Trump lawyer John Eastman’s attempt to withhold documents from the probe, raising the spectre it has evidence he was involved in a crime. The sealed filing – intended to undercut Eastman’s claim that he should not be forced to turn over thousands of emails requested by the panel because those records were protected by attorney-client privilege – meant the precise nature of the motion was not clear. But when asked by the Guardian whether the select committee would say in the filing that the privilege claim should not apply in this case because of the so-called crime-fraud exception, the chairman of the panel, Bennie Thompson, said “there is a reference to it”. The sealed filing is also expected to reveal new details about Eastman’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and disregard the Electoral Count Act at the joint session of Congress on 6 January as he sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election. A spokesperson for the select committee did not respond to a request for comment. Eastman has so far turned over about 8,000 pages of emails and documents from 4-7 January to the panel, but has withheld an additional 11,000 documents on the basis that they are protected by attorney-client privilege or constitute confidential attorney work product. The select committee has previously disputed his privilege claims by arguing that he has not demonstrated he had been formally retained as a lawyer for Trump, the White House or the Trump campaign. An ‘engagement letter’ that Eastman produced last week was unsigned. Eastman was a central figure to Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and helped lead a “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington that orchestrated a scheme to have then-vice-president Mike Pence return Trump to office.",News/US news,January 6 commitee files legal challenge against former Trump lawyer,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/02/january-6-commitee-challenge-trump-lawyer
