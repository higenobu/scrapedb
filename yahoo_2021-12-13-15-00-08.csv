12/13/2021,"To hear him tell it, there isn’t much that self-proclaimed “godman” Paramahamsa Nithyananda can’t do with his alleged supernatural powers. Want to hear a cow or monkey speak Sanskrit? He’s your man. Heal the blind? Check. ESP, stop sunrise, see through walls? The swami says he can do all these and more. And if you swear your fealty to him and start making donations, he’ll teach you how to do them too. Nithyananda, who claims to be the physical embodiment of Lord Shiva, is the man skeptics and debunkers love to hate. But he’s pulled off a couple of tricks that not even his most strident detractors can explain. For example, managing to flee India one step ahead of the law and without valid travel papers back in 2019. Or how he continues to evade justice to this day, despite being wanted by Interpol on charges of rape and kidnapping. Narendra Nayak, the president of the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations [FIRA], called Nithyananda a “fraud and a cheat” in an interview with The Daily Beast. “But how he managed to get out of the country is a mystery because his passport had expired long back!” he said. Nayak has publicly challenged the claims of paranormal powers made by the swami and his legions of followers. He has also designed tests in which the miracle workers are asked to show off their gifts in a controlled setting, without hidden cameras or other aids. The inability to repeat their feats under monitored conditions does nothing to persuade Nithyananda’s true believers, and some have gone so far as to threaten Nayak for exposing their parlor tricks. One such vengeance seeker even vowed to cast a “curse that I would get carcinoma of the penis,” said Nayak, who described his metaphysical assailant as “a woman disciple of Nithyananda’s who said she had already granted cancer of the brain to someone who had challenged her man.” Nithyananda, 43, began practicing yoga at the age of three. He later roamed the Himalayas as part of his spiritual training before opening his own ashram in the Indian state of Karnataka in 2003. He served as chairman of the Hindu University of America. Although exiled and in hiding he remains wildly popular on social media—his Facebook page alone boasts some 1.1 million followers—and he often surfaces to drop video clips full of grandiose statements, such as claiming that he and only he could cure India’s COVID woes. “Though some of his pronouncements look like jokes, they are all calculated to bring more attention to himself and [serve as] clickbait,” Nayak said. Nayak isn’t the only critic to lock horns in public with Nithyananda. Journalist Nakkheeran Gopal helped bring to light some of the swami’s alleged wrongdoings and wound up in court. Swami Paramhamsa Nityananda is taken into custody in 2010.  A nationally acclaimed Indian journalist who operates his own magazine and website, Gopal told The Daily Beast he published “secretly recorded” videos that he said exposed Nithyananda’s “sexual indulgence with young sanyasi [mendicant] girls in his ashramam.” In a resulting lawsuit, the godman and his lawyers contended the videos were “morphed” or computer generated, according to Gopal. “[The] court found and held that the clippings were not morphed and dismissed his suit,” Gopal said. A sex tape starring the so-called “Sex Swami” had surfaced in 2010, and in that case too he had tried to claim the video was faked, although forensic experts eventually testified otherwise. But videos coming to light were just the start of Nithyananda’s trouble. He was later accused of rape by an American woman, Aarthi Rao, who had come to study yoga and meditation under him—and who later stated that she thought she was “having sex with God.” At the time, Rao believed that her personal yogi was “not just an enlightened master, but an avatar and incarnation.” Furthermore, the guru convinced Rao herself that she was the “chosen one” ordained by the godhead to be his sole companion in this world—until she found him sleeping around with other students, according to news reports at the time. Rao pressed charges against her former teacher in both Michigan and India, “yet he continues to go scot free & harass the witnesses & critics through his brainwashed disciples & followers,” she tweeted. Shiva’s personal avatar was later accused of luring at least four underage girls to his ashram and holding them in an apartment against their will, leading to government charges of abduction against him. Police escort controversial Hindu Godman Swami Nityananda after his bail plea in 2012.  By 2019, Nithyananda “found the due processes of law finally closing in on him,” according to Nayak. “He had tried to dodge [the charges] for so long by filing plea after plea [and] obtaining adjournments, trying to cast aspersions on character of the one who had complained of rape and so on. Finally there were no more avenues left and he absconded,” Nayak said. It eventually came to light that the godman had the students of his ashram sign a sexually explicit non-disclosure agreement that would scare the hell out of loving parents from any culture. According to India Today the clause read: ""Volunteer understands that the Program may involve the learning and practice of ancient tantric secrets associated with male and female ecstasy, including the use of sexual energy for increased intimacy/spiritual connection, pleasure, harmony, and freedom. Volunteer understands that these activities could be physically and mentally challenging, and may involve nudity, access to visual images, graphic visual depictions, and descriptions of nudity and sexual activity, close physical proximity and intimacy, verbal and written descriptions and audio sounds of a sexually oriented, and erotic nature, etc."" The Nithyananda isn’t the first self-styled godman to get himself into trouble in India for sexually exploting his cult-like followers. “There have been quite a few scandals over the years,” said Dr. Brian Collins, an expert on Hindu studies at the University of Ohio, in an email. Collins added that “there is most often money (and/or sex) involved” and that some of the godmen “use their money and power to escape consequences.” Collins also said that many in India don’t see a living incarnation of the supreme deity as being so farfetched, which can help traditional godmen like Nithyananda establish their sway over the masses. “Unlike in Christianity, gods come to earth in many forms in Hinduism, so the idea of the divine in a human being is not particularly scandalous for most people,” Collins said. Dr. Patrick McCartney, who studies the intersection between religion and anthropology at the School of Global Environmental Studies in Kyoto Japan, described Nithyananda as being ""about as sleezy as a used-car salesman at the afterparty to a used-car dealer's convention."" “His followers are attracted to him because he promises to help them gain powers. People seem to feel powerless and so through his pretence of being all powerful they believe they too can become a powerful yogi.” “Cult leaders [like Nithyananda] use psychological manipulation to break and rebuild targeted individuals into their puppets,” said Dr. Robert Bunker, director of research and analysis at the security consultancy C/O Futures, LLC. “The specialness, and at times divine origins, of the group’s members and the identification of the ‘others’ who become the sworn enemies of the group are part and parcel of this approach,” Bunker said. He also helped explain why the swami’s many die-hards run propaganda websites that defend his actions and tear down his accusers, and why they might try to curse his enemies with cancers of the brain and genitals. “Once a cult follower has been turned into a ‘true believer’ all bets are off as far as their potential for violence… Such reprogrammed people will readily fight for and kill on command of their god.” Other sex-crazed mystics may come and go, but Nithyananda has secured his place in the godman pantheon by founding his own “country” after he lit out of India on the lam in 2019. His “Hindu nation” is known as Kailaasa and is described on the national Website as a country “without borders” intended to function as home for “the ancient enlightened Hindu civilizational nation which is being revived by displaced Hindus from around the world.” Kailaasa allegedly boasts its own currency, flag, bureaucracy, and COVID policy. It’s rumored to be off the coast of Ecuador, with visa-approved tourist flights coming in by charter from Australia, although the Ecuadorian government has categorically denied selling the swami an island or even granting him asylum. “Kailaasa is a decoy,” said journalist Gopal. “There is no Kailaasa island. My guess is [Nithyananda] is hiding in some secret place in Nepal or any other Hindu lenient country, where he is facilitated to appear on social media.” Others have posited that Kailaasa is in fact a “virtual nation”—that is, a metaphor for the dozens of NGOs that have been set up to receive donations and engage in pro-Nithyananda outreach programs across three continents, including at least 10 in the U.S. From Pennsylvania in the east to Hawaii out west, from as far south as Houston to as far north as Minnesota, the guru’s networkers have established a series of franchise-like branch offices that serve as embassies “for global representation for the diaspora who are practitioners (Hindus) of Sanatan Dharma (Hinduism),” according to documents obtained by India Today. Like traditional consulates, they also gather intel about the U.S. and other nations so as to “analyse [the] political and economic situation of the host country and report back to appropriate Kailaasa ministry on issues that affect the Kailaasa.” India Today quoted the maligned spiritual leader explaining how Kailaasa might work as a broad-based religious organization—one that could also fill his personal coffers and fund his fugitive lifestyle—during an Internet address in which he said: “People are donating all over the world, working with the local governments because each donation in any country belongs to that country's NGO, follows that country's laws, working with those countries in an organised way [so] this whole structure is absolutely ready.” For FIRA’s Narendra, however, the as yet undiscovered country is likely just the latest iteration of the Sex Swami’s old M.O. “His Kailaasa seems to be a harem with himself as the master stud,” Narendra said. Whatever or wherever Kailaasa is, the fact remains that Nithyananda continues to evade an Interpol manhunt, while also dressing in conspicuous orange robes and appearing regularly on Internet broadcasts. “It is an intriguing mystery that Interpol has failed to trace him,” Gopal said. “Some stealthy protection helps him.” Interpol declined an interview request for this story. In late 2019, Indian police traced the fugitive godman as far as the island of Trinidad, in the southeastern Caribbean, where he had gone to attend a religious event. The Times of India cited a police spokesperson who indicated that Nithyananda and some of his female acolytes had later departed Trinidad on a private jet bound for Ecuador. But he didn’t stay there long. Not only does Ecuador deny selling him an island, it seems they were also quick to show him on his way: “Ecuador denied the request for international personal protection (refuge) made by Mr. Nithyananda before Ecuador and later on Mr. Nithyananda left Ecuador,” the government said in a statement in December 2019. And that was the last time the whereabouts of the god-made-flesh renegade were known. Security analyst Bunker said the godman’s elusiveness is abetted by his ranks of fanatical worshippers. “Since cult leaders typically suck out the wealth of their adherents, they amass large war chests in which to invest in properties and businesses[,] and also bribe public officials in less developed countries,” Bunker said. “I have no doubt front companies are being used, travel documents forged with bogus identities, and safe houses established to protect him.” In spite of his ability to elude international law enforcement, religious anthropologist McCartney referred to Nithyananda as “just another shady snake oil spiritual salesman” duping gullible people. He also described the relationship between the godmen and their followers as one based on mutual necessity. “The guru needs gullible devotees and the devotees need a guru to take away all self-responsibility,” McCartney said. “It's much easier to let the guru direct you in life than to take charge of one's own.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

12/13/2021,"Dec. 11—For the early-rising workaholic or the 5 a.m. gym nut, caffeine may be part of a morning ritual for the day. Whether it's waking up before an hour-long commute or bringing blood to the muscles to pump some iron, a study published by the National Institutes of Health asserts that 85% of Americans drink at least one caffeinated beverage each day. Kat Thomsen, a registered dietitian at Avera Queen of Peace Hospital in Mitchell, said caffeine consumption is not a major concern of healthcare providers — if consumed in moderation. ""Caffeine is a natural stimulant, so it's found in different seeds or beans around the world like coffee beans,"" Thomsen said. ""I think the advice for caffeine goes for almost everything, that it's OK in moderation."" MORE FROM NEWSMD: Mitchell native part of South Dakota State team unraveling how cancer evades immune system Some governments around the world classify caffeine as a drug, but the United States takes a different stance. While the NIH acknowledges that caffeine has addictive properties similar to many scheduled drugs, it considers caffeine reliance a dependency, not an addiction. Caffeine's chemical properties actually help a person feel like they have more energy by working to increase blood flow throughout the body. ""It's a central nervous stimulant. A lot of times it's tied to exercise because it helps people perform a little bit better when they get the right amount, just because it's stimulating the central nervous system, their heart and their muscles as well,"" Thomsen said. When it enters the body, caffeine will bind to receptors in the nerves, helping to block chemicals associated with stress, which can help an individual feel more alert. Despite this, Thomsen said there's a limit to how much caffeine should be consumed in a day. ""The national limit is 400 milligrams a day,"" Thomsen said. ""One energy drink is 180 milligrams a day. One drink of coffee is a little bit less than that, so you're going to be within the recommended range for caffeine, but it's multiple drinks that could add up to be too high."" Some popular brands of pre-workout actually contains up to 330 milligrams of caffeine in a single serving. A study published by the National Coffee Association found more than half of Americans were cutting that limit close, consuming an average of over 300 milligrams of caffeine each day. ""I think a lot of people don't realize that too much caffeine can be harmful,"" Thomsen said. ""If you're drinking two or more energy drinks in a day, long term that can cause undue stress to your body."" Overstimulation of the central nervous system can cause the heart and muscles to work too hard, which over time can cause damage to their long-term performance. ""If you're doing that, chronically, too much, that's where you can start to see potential damage to your body,"" Thomsen noted. It also can harm the brain, as being too alert throughout the day carries a chance to feel anxious while making it harder for your brain to settle down for a healthy night's sleep. ""Short term, you're maybe a little bit more on. But the same side, though, is sleep can also help you actually perform better and focus, too,"" Thomsen said. ""So that's kind of a double-edged sword. If you're taking so much caffeine that you're not sleeping, well, It's probably not helping."" Ultimately, Thomsen recommends individuals take note of where caffeine comes from, noting other ingredients in energy drinks may not be as beneficial to the body as caffeine from coffee or tea. ""I think the source of your caffeine matters, too. There's obviously going to be some health benefits to drinking coffee or tea,"" Thomsen said. ""Regular soda or energy drinks probably aren't going to give you the same benefits."" Thomsen believes caffeine can be part of a well-balanced life, as long as the consumer practices moderation. She suggests individuals with too high of an intake slowly wean off the substance. Avera Health offers one-on-one visits with dietitians and nutrition specialists to determine what diet can best support an individual's health goals at their facilities throughout Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota.","Health/The Daily Republic, Mitchell, S.D.",Caffeine is consumed daily by 85% of Americans.

12/13/2021,"By Frank Jack Daniel and Drazen Jorgic (Reuters) - A creeping barrage of U.S. sanctions on top Central American officials has made China an attractive partner for governments resisting Washington's push to tackle corruption and democratic backsliding in the region, officials and analysts say. The trend was thrust into focus this week when Nicaragua re-established ties with Beijing, severing a longstanding relationship with U.S. ally Taiwan, which relies heavily on diplomatic recognition from small countries. Other countries in the region are also courting China. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele ratified his country's new economic cooperation accord with China earlier this year after Washington put close aides of his on a corruption blacklist. Bukele, who this week accused Washington of demanding ""absolute submission or bust"", in May celebrated that China had made $500 million public investments ""without conditions."" Nicaragua's decision to embrace China followed a slew of sanctions against aides to President Daniel Ortega following his re-election for a fourth consecutive term in a campaign steeped in the arrests of leading opposition figures. While Nicaragua's case is ""unique"" in Central America due to its increasingly authoritarian bent, the international isolation of Ortega played a role in his switch to China, according to a senior U.S. official, who noted: ""As the sanctions tighten, they look for other avenues and economic partners, there is an element of that."" U.S. pressure on Central American officials ranges from visa revocations to Treasury sanctions, effectively cutting them off from the global banking system. For El Salvador, Washington is also readying criminal charges against two senior Bukele allies. Beijing offers respite from U.S. pressure, a strategy that has previously thrown economic lifelines to leaders isolated from the West elsewhere in the region, including Venezuela, said R. Evan Ellis, a professor at the U.S. Army War College. ""China, in pursuing its strategic economic interests, is sustaining authoritarian populists in power, leading to a region which is ever less democratic,"" said Ellis, an expert on China's engagement with Latin America. 'DEBT DIPLOMACY' Seeking to rebuff Chinese advances in the region, U.S officials have cast Beijing as an unreliable partner for nations desperate for investment to ratchet up faltering economies. Pointing to China's investments across the globe that the United States terms ""debt diplomacy"", U.S. officials allege Beijing leaves poorer nations swamped with debts. Beijing, which refutes such claims, says it deals with allies as an equal partner and does not meddle in their domestic affairs - an enticing prospect for leaders in a region where the United States has historically wielded vast influence. In private though, Guatemalan business leaders, for example, fret that U.S. pursuit of political elites for graft will drive government officials towards more forgiving allies. Still, Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, who was not invited to a U.S. summit on democracy this week, traveled to Washington anyway and pledged his loyalty to Taiwan. In Honduras too, the incoming government of President-elect Xiomara Castro has committed to Taipei for now, and close relations with Washington, despite openly toying with a switch to Beijing during her election campaign. The United States has welcomed that, with the senior U.S. official saying Washington is willing to provide a ""surge"" in aid to help Castro https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-next-government-maintain-taiwan-ties-now-transition-team-says-2021-12-10 meet her priority of alleviating Honduras' dire economic situation. Still, some Castro allies, including Rodolfo Pastor, a senior member of her transition team, say his country must keep its options on China open https://news.trust.org/item/20211210182535-z0yl8, harboring the possibility that Honduras could recognize Beijing in the future. ""I suspect the price Honduras will be trying to extract from its Taiwanese patrons not to flip just went up significantly,"" said Ellis at the U.S. Army War College, pointing to Nicaragua.
