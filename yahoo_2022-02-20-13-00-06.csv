2/20/2022,"School bus driver Jacob Thomson said he's not a hero for intervening when he saw a female student walking and acting uncomfortable as a man followed her. ""That instinct of being a dad, I guess, kicked in,"" Thomson said Friday about why he drove the bus around the block to check on the student. The Abilene Independent School District bus driver was starting his middle school route at about 7:30 a.m. Monday when he saw the older man following a teenager girl near the intersection of Butternut and South 16th streets. ""I don't know what he said to her, but he got her attention in some way. And, it startled her at first. That's what kind of caught my eye to keep looking to make sure that everything was OK,"" Thomson said. He normally drops off a student at Bowie Elementary at that time of day, but only one other student for his middle school route was on his bus. ""I was very fortunate that God put me in the situation I was in because I just happened to be in the right place at the right time,"" Thomson said. ""Thirty seconds or one minute to unload a student at the school could have made all the difference in the world. I might not have been there."" As Thomson's bus No. 112 approached the girl, the suspect turned around and walked away. Thomson told the girl, who is a student at a different middle school not on his route, that she could sit in his bus and wait until her regular bus arrived. ""She was obviously distraught,"" Thomson said. The student said the man tried to kidnap her and told her that he loved her and tried to offer a vape cigarette, Thomson said. ""I guess it's something to entice your child to come over to,"" he said. He contacted bus dispatch and waited a couple of minutes until the student's regular bus arrived. After driving a few blocks, Thomson noticed several police vehicles at an unrelated disturbance and pulled over to tell an officer about the incident. ""He followed up and took care of the situation immediately. And, within 30 minutes to an hour, I was told the suspect is in custody. So, shout out to APD for doing their due diligence while they were already inundated with calls and busy doing other things,"" Thomson said. A student resource officer also interviewed the student once she arrived at her middle school, according to a court document. The student told the SRO the suspect had grabbed her hand and tried to drag her to an abandoned house. Police said the main was a transient. He was charged with third-degree felony injury to a child, and his bond was set at $15,000. As of Friday afternoon, he was in the Taylor County Jail, according to online jail records. Abilene police in a news release Thursday commended Thomson's actions. He said the mother of the student also contacted him to express her gratitude. ""I think more the heroes that should be called out are APD for responding as fast as they did,"" Thomson said. Thomson said he did what any parent would have in the same situation, if they were observant. ""We're so caught up nowadays to being stuck in our cell phones that we're not aware of what's going on around us and others,"" Thomson said. Being constantly aware of events happening in the surroundings is a lesson he tries to teach his young son and daughter, he said. ""Just because it was a female that it happened to doesn't mean that it's not boys that are also victims. You try to teach both your kids the same way to be aware of the situation and always pay attention to what's around them and just be mindful,"" Thomson said. Thomson is an Abilene native who returned to his hometown after living in San Antonio for a couple of years. He attended Bonham Elementary, the now shuttered Lincoln Middle School and Abilene High. He worked five years in maintenance at senior living facilities before becoming a bus driver in late October. Abilene ISD, like many districts across the state, has a bus driver shortage. It's a job he said he enjoys. ""They're definitely not as hard to drive as you would think they are. You can swing them around corners better than you think,"" he said. And, the students also have been manageable, he said. ""I don't really have any problems with mine,"" Thomson said about his young riders. ""I mean, every batch has its bad apples, but if you just kind of start off and be firm with them but not rude, then you have a lot better success with your kids.""

2/20/2022,"February is set to be nothing short of a prolific month! The month kicked off with a New Moon in Aquarius ushering in the energy of new beginnings and change, and just one day later, we got to experience what some called the first of the last three 222 days of the century, which occur on February 2, 2022, February 20, 2022 and February 22, 2022. Yep, you read that correctly. This is the end of a 222 sequence that started back in 2000, with other key years of 2002, 2020 and 2022. We won’t see this sequence again until 2/2/2222—but what’s the significance, anyway? In numerology, the 222 sequence of numbers are often referred to as Angel Numbers. Also, the number 2 in numerology references the energy of duality, partnership, relationship and balance. The key lessons when dealing with the number 2 are generally centered around compromise, acceptance, compassion, cooperation and harmony.

When 2 is in sequence like it is in 222, this energy is super-charged. There is a call to approach life with more compassion, to seek better balance, to work cooperatively with others, to seek partnership when you can and strive for harmony. When you think about the last almost 22 years, don’t so many of these themes ring true? This is especially profound when you think about 2020! There is no way we could have made it through the last two years without compassion and cooperation. So much of our world has changed, especially the ways in which we interact with others. Click here to read the full article. What’s more, the United States has it’s very first Pluto Return on 2/20/2022 coinciding with the second 222 day of the month. Since America is a relatively young country, it has never experienced the return of Pluto or the start of a new Pluto cycle. For your reference, when Pluto—the lord of destruction, transformation and power—makes a return (which takes approximately 247 years) that entity (in this case, the US) has an opportunity to let go of archaic systems and structures that no longer benefit the masses, so that every individual associated with that entity gets to maximize the potential of their soul. If we look to older countries for some insight, it’s very easy to deduce that major power shifts occurred during that time. Pluto Returns in France and Russia marked the deaths of Napoleon and Stalin. Spanish dictator Francisco Franco relinquished power during Spain’s last Pluto Return. Some even argue that the UK’s last Pluto Return coincides with their unofficial fall from world leader status. Historically, this time is marked with a lot of change and most believe that for the US that will be no different. Fortunately, the good thing about change and transformation is, well, change and transformation. As painful as it might be to see failure, it is incredibly powerful to be able to see potential. This is what makes the 222 days so profound! 222 days serve as a reminder for us to know that, no matter what happens in our world, we are in a time of cooperation, compassion, duality and harmony—if we so choose to embody these qualities. So, hopefully you choose to use the last days of this magical 222 energy like a portal to channel all the love and hope you can. For yourself first, and then for others.
