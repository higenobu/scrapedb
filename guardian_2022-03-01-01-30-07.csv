3/1/2022,"John Oliver addressed the issue of sex work and how it’s treated within the US on his weekly HBO show Last Week Tonight. The host started by saying that sex is “a topic that historically we’ve not been very good at talking about” but that sex work is poorly handled in America as a result of local, state and federal laws. “Everything about the way we regulate sex work in this country is confusing and counter-productive,” he said. It’s either “demonising, patronising or just plain wrong”. Sex work has “always been a part of society” and sex workers “are not a monolith” but that’s often not taken into consideration. While police “position themselves as saviours for sex workers”, they are mostly “arresting and jailing them”. He then showed footage of an interview that implied that sex workers should be thankful for police intervention but “there isn’t a thank you section in Hallmark called ‘for your arresting officer’”. He used examples of police who have had sex with sex workers during sex operations and said that between 2016 and 2020, almost everyone arrested by the NYPD for selling sex was a person of color. Police often use loitering for the purpose of prostitution as a reason to arrest which is “basically a stop and frisk policy for sex workers” and based on vague judgments. Cops have also seized condoms as evidence and criminalising condoms has led them to go without. “It’s a crime to carry condoms sounds like the name of a Christian boy band’s self-released album,” he joked. Sex workers have also had to end up registering as sex offenders. “I don’t want to paint too rosy a picture here,” he said. ”Sex work can be dangerous and we need to be talking constructively about how to make it safer in every possible way.” But too often it’s conflated with sex trafficking and “the implicit suggestion is that no sex worker has ever entered the trade by choice”. One woman was charged with trafficking herself while shutting down sex workers on sites like Craigslist and Backpage has removed a much safer route to get clients. “It is no surprise that many workers who have been robbed or abused by clients report that they feel they can’t turn to the police for help,” he said. While the Nordic model criminalises the buying of sex but not the selling, used in Sweden, Finland, Norway and France, it makes it difficult to vet clients. Legalisation, used in Amsterdam and some counties in Nevada, turn sex workers into independent contractors but they have to work at regulated brothels that often take as much as 60% of earnings. He believes the solution is decriminalisation, used in New Zealand, which gives them fundamental rights and is a direction for the US to strive toward. There is always the concern that some people feel economically pushed into sex work but “the only way to make sure people have a choice in how they earn money is to make housing affordable, healthcare accessible and to not burden marginalised people.”",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver: sex work regulation in the US is ‘confusing and counter-productive’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-recap-sex-work
3/1/2022,"When Chris Wilder got chatting to Antonio Conte at a recent awards night, Middlesbrough’s manager jokingly accused the Italian of copying his tactical blueprint. At his former club, Sheffield United, and, albeit to a lesser extent, on Teesside today, Wilder has built teams around attack-minded wing-backs and a trio of sometimes overlapping centre-halves. It is not a million miles removed from the system Conte swiftly installed at Tottenham, favoured utilising at previous clubs and, like his FA Cup fifth-round opponents on Tuesday night, seems philosophically attuned to. “I said to Antonio at one awards evening that he was copying me,” Wilder recalled as he looked forward to a reunion with Conte in front of a near 35,000 sellout crowd at the Riverside. “But, actually, I’m not so sure about that. Spurs have a world-class manager.” If Conte is unlikely to underestimate a Boro side not merely pushing strongly for promotion from the Championship but which knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup – winning on penalties at Old Trafford in the fourth round – Wilder is certainly not downplaying the tactical challenge ahead. “Just look at Antonio Conte’s record,” he said. “It speaks for itself and he’s got an incredible passion to help his team. For us to beat Spurs would be an incredible achievement. “Just as we did at Old Trafford, we understand that a lot of things have to go for us and we have to be at our absolute best to give ourselves an opportunity.” Middlesbrough have improved significantly since Wilder succeeded Neil Warnock in November but, following an unforeseen 3-2 defeat at Barnsley last Saturday, they slipped to eighth in the second tier, two points off a play-off place. “If we play as badly as we did in the first 15 minutes at Oakwell it will quickly be game over against Spurs and we might as well go home at half time,” Wilder said. Boro’s manager will welcome the return of Matt Crooks, so impressive at Manchester United, to midfield following suspension. He is also hoping his influential Australia international Riley McGree could be passed fit in time to start in the same department. Crooks, who began his career at Manchester United, has impressed this season after being signed from Rotherham by Warnock last summer. Wilder believes the 28-year-old is one of a number of Boro players potentially capable of holding their own at Premier league level. “Matt’s work ethic is fabulous and he chips in with goals too,” Boro’s manager said of his leading scorer. “He was good against Manchester United but blew up after 60 minutes because of the emotional exhaustion of playing against his former club. “Hopefully Matt will have learnt from that because, to play in the biggest games, you can’t get emotional, you’ve got to stay calm.”",Sport/Football,Chris Wilder sees Antonio Conte parallels as Boro meet Spurs in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/chris-wilder-sees-antonio-conte-parallels-as-boro-meet-spurs-in-fa-cup
3/1/2022,"Pressure is mounting on Israel to conclude the trial of a Gazan aid worker accused of funnelling relief money to Hamas in a six-year-old case widely derided by the international community as “not worthy of a democratic state”. Mohammed El Halabi, the head of the US-based charity World Vision’s Gaza office, was detained in 2016 after being accused by Israel’s Shin Bet security service of transferring $7.2m (£5.4m) a year to the Palestinian militant group in control of the Gaza Strip. World Vision said the amount was more than its entire operating budget for the enclave, and an independent donor government audit carried out in the wake of Halabi’s arrest found no evidence of wrongdoing or diversion of funds. More than 160 court sessions later, Halabi, 45, remains in administrative detention, despite serious flaws in the Israeli case. The Beersheba district court heard closing arguments last October; it is unclear what is now delaying the verdict. The Israeli justice ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. At a hearing at Israel’s high court last week, Halabi’s detention was extended for another three months. The court said it would only issue the extension after checking that the lower court would be able to issue a verdict before the order expires in May, giving rise to an expectation that a verdict will be issued soon. Halabi’s legal team has been pushing for him to be moved from prison to a home arrest facility in Haifa, which the high court said would be considered if the Beersheba court continued to delay. Maher Hanna, one of Halabi’s lawyers, said: “There is no reason for the verdict to be taking this long, or for any of the delays and secretive procedures we have seen in the last six years. It is difficult for Israel to say its courts are fair in a case like this.” Hanna said he had been unable to properly cross-examine witnesses whose identities were obscured, or take home records of court sessions, and had often been denied access to critical evidence declared confidential. A supposed confession from Halabi, based on notes made by an investigator who talked to another prisoner who heard it, was reportedly lost by police. “The facts are very clear and the case should have been dropped a long time ago … but the Israelis need to find a face-saving way out since Mohammed refused a plea deal,” Hanna said. The prisoners’ rights group Addameer has said that “many Palestinian detainees plead guilty for offences they did not commit and waive their right to continue with judicial procedures”, often because of a lack of faith in the Israeli civil and military court systems to deliver fair and timely verdicts. With World Vision’s legal backing, however, Halabi has been able to take what his father described as a “principled stand”, refusing to admit to crimes he says he did not commit and avoiding further damage to World Vision’s reputation. The charity suspended its Gaza operations after Halabi’s arrest, shutting down psychosocial programming for 40,000 children, as well as provision of medical supplies and food relief. “We don’t want compensation, we don’t want this to drag on longer with an appeal [after a possible conviction]”, said Khalil El Halabi, Mohammed’s father. “We just want an apology, and for Mohammed to come home.” In the years since the peace process ground to a halt, Israel has faced growing criticism of its treatment of Palestinians as the conflict is increasingly viewed internationally as a struggle for equal rights rather than a territorial dispute. UN human rights experts, diplomats and NGOs have repeatedly called on Israel to grant Halabi access to a fair trial or immediately release him.",News/World news,Israel under pressure to conclude flawed case against aid worker,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/israel-under-pressure-trial-aid-worker-mohammed-el-halabi

The open letter, released by literary and free expression organisation PEN International, is addressed to writers in Ukraine, and “urgently” calls “for an end to the bloodshed” that started last week. “We stand united in condemnation of a senseless war, waged by President Putin’s refusal to accept the rights of Ukraine’s people to debate their future allegiance and history without Moscow’s interference,” say the international writers, who include Nobel laureates Orhan Pamuk, Svetlana Alexievich and Olga Tokarczuk, as well as Jonathan Franzen, Colm Tóibín and Elif Shafak. “We stand united in support of writers, journalists, artists, and all the people of Ukraine, who are living through their darkest hours. We stand by you and feel your pain,” they add, in a letter also released in Ukrainian, Russian and Arabic. “All individuals have a right to peace, free expression and free assembly. Putin’s war is an attack on democracy and freedom not just in Ukraine, but around the world … There can be no free and safe Europe without a free and independent Ukraine. Peace must prevail.” The Handmaid’s Tale author Atwood also shared a photograph of herself attending a march in Toronto to protest against the invasion of Ukraine, complete with Ukrainian flag and knitted cat hat. “Thousands at #ukraine rally in #toronto; great to hear Canadian political parties all agreed for once and are supporting Ukraine,” she tweeted.",Arts/Books,Margaret Atwood joins writers condemning Russian invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/28/margaret-atwood-joins-writers-condemning-russian-invasion-of-ukraine
3/1/2022,"Antonio Conte takes his Tottenham team to Middlesbrough on Tuesday seeking to extend his remarkable record in the FA Cup – he has lost only once in 15 matches and has never failed to reach the final, a feat Spurs last managed more than three decades ago – but with his confidence deflated by the quality on display on Sunday in the Carabao Cup final between Chelsea and Liverpool, a match that persuaded the Italian that winning domestic silverware in England has become even harder than doing so in Europe. “I was lucky to reach the final in two years in a row, and I’d like to keep up this tradition,” Conte said. “But this trophy is not easy. Tomorrow we have to face Middlesbrough, a tough game. You know very well they eliminated Manchester United from this competition. And I want to celebrate the game played by Chelsea and Liverpool. It was exciting to watch this game, it was [like] a final of the Champions League. It also underlines the difficulty of winning trophies in this country. It was fantastic sport. I think England has to be proud about this. “To win a trophy now in England is very difficult. In this moment it’s easier to win in Europe than England, because you know in the end you have to fight against the top, top teams. We reached the semi-final of the Carabao Cup and in this moment I think it is a good result for Tottenham, and this has to push us, to try to become more competitive and lift a trophy as soon as possible.” Tottenham have won their last two away games, against Manchester City and Leeds. The latter was a fifth defeat in six for the home side, leading to Marcelo Bielsa’s departure from Elland Road. “I’m really disappointed, because we’re talking about an important manager and we’re talking about a person who is a master, for many managers, many coaches, in the past and in the present,” Conte said of the Argentinian. “He is not only a manager with a great vision of football who taught a lot to other people, but at the same time I have great respect for him as a person, as a man, because in every situation he’s showed great integrity, and in football you cannot always find this type of person.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte hopes to maintain ‘lucky’ FA Cup record against Middlesbrough,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/antonio-conte-hopes-to-maintain-lucky-fa-cup-record-against-middlesbrough
3/1/2022,"Pep Guardiola will select Oleksandr Zinchenko for Manchester City’s FA Cup tie at Peterborough, believing it will be “good” for the Ukrainian left-back as he continues to deal with his country being invaded by Russia. Zinchenko was an unused substitute for the 1-0 win at Everton on Saturday, City’s first game since the invasion. The 25-year-old defender, who has voiced dismay at Russia’s leader Vladimir Putin, will start the fifth-round game at London Road. “[He will be] absolutely fine, I think it will be good for him to play and show the reason why he is here,” Guardiola said. “He is a magnificent player [and] needs to play football.” On the basis that Zinchenko does feature against Peterborough, he will be the first Premier League-based Ukrainian to do so since the invasion. Everton’s Vitaliy Mykolenko was also an unused substitute at Goodison Park on Saturday while West Ham’s Andriy Yarmolenko has been granted compassionate leave by the club. City extended their lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League to six points with their win against Everton but the triumph was a controversial one given the penalty that was not awarded to the hosts following Rodri’s clear control of the ball with his arm shortly after Phil Foden had scored for the visitors. Neither the referee, Paul Tierney, nor the VAR, Chris Kavanagh, deemed Rodri’s action a handball, which outraged the majority of those in attendance, as well as most watching from afar. Everton have reportedly lodged a formal complaint to the Premier League over not just Rodri’s handball but other decisions in recent matches involving the club. Asked if a single incident, such as Rodri’s handball, has the power to determine the destiny of the title race, Guardiola said: “For sure – I will review a lot of incidents [then]. What I would say about this is if it is not offside it is a penalty. “It’s one game. If we lose the next one the momentum is over. It was a good example [versus Everton] of what we will face in the next 11 games and shows we are able to face it.” Zack Steffen, City’s regular cup goalkeeper, is injured for the game against Peterborough.

3/1/2022,"Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv as ceasefire talks between Kyiv and Moscow got under way, with the Kremlin facing unprecedented international sanctions that have created “a new economic reality” for Russia. The Élysée Palace said after a call between Emmanuel Macron and Vladimir Putin that the Russian president had said he was “willing to commit” to ending attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure while the talks were taking place. But after four days of fighting and a slower that expected Russian advance, the Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Herashchenko said on Monday Kharkiv had been “massively fired on”, leaving “dozens of dead and hundreds of wounded”. The news came hours after the Ukrainian presidency announced that it had begun negotiations with a Russian delegation on the border with Belarus, aimed at achieving “an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian forces”. With fighting continuing around several cities and the Russian rouble in free fall, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged Russian troops to abandon their equipment and leave the battlefield to save their lives, claiming 4,500 were already dead. As Russia’s nuclear forces were placed on high alert in line with Putin’s orders to his defence chiefs on Sunday, Zelenskiy said he was sceptical about the talks’ prospects for success, but added: “Let them try.” Pre-dawn blasts were again heard in the capital, Kyiv, in Kharkiv and in the port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, officials said, but they added that the attempts of Russian ground forces to capture major urban centres were still being repelled. Western analysts said they were alarmed, however, by a referendum vote in neighbouring pro-Russian Belarus that could result in nuclear weapons being stationed on Belarusian soil for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union. A senior US intelligence official said the Belarus president, Alexander Lukashenko, who recently backed Putin’s military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role, could also send troops to help Russia in the next 24 hours. Terrified Ukrainian families huddled in shelters, basements or corridors, with millions thought to have fled their homes and more than 500,000 having left Ukraine to escape the biggest invasion of a European country since the second world war. Natalia Balasynovych, the mayor of Vasilkiv, which has been under heavy fire in recent days, said she believed most people in her town would accept a compromise to stop the war. “We would like to see compromise, but not capitulation,” she said. “Maybe neutral status for Ukraine, if it stops them shooting now. Because to live like this is not possible. If they offer us only the condition of capitulation, then we have to fight to the end. But I would like our children never to wake up with these bombs.” Russia’s defence ministry said that its forces had taken control of the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in Ukraine’s south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. At least 102 civilians in Ukraine have been killed, with 304 more wounded, but the real figure will be “considerably higher”, the UN human rights commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, said earlier on Monday. A US defence official said Russia had fired more than 350 missiles. The Kremlin conceded on Monday that Russia’s economic reality had changed, but said there was no reason to doubt its central bank, which raised interest rates to 20% as it sought to shield the economy from tough new western sanctions. Panicked Russians withdrew savings and sought to exchange roubles for dollars and euros, while Russian businesses scrambled to protect their finances as the rouble lost nearly 30% of its value against the dollar on Monday. Measures adopted by the US, the UK, EU member states and other countries have blocked some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system and severely restricted the Russian central bank’s ability to deploy its $640bn of foreign reserves. “The economic reality has considerably changed,” said the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. “These are heavy sanctions, they are problematic, but Russia has the potential to offset the harm. Russia has been making plans for quite a long time.” The EU has also shut all Russian planes out of its airspace, forcing the Russian airline Aeroflot to cancel all flights to European destinations until further notice. The Russian state media outlets RT and Sputnik have also been banned in the EU. Switzerland on Monday set aside its tradition of neutrality and said it would adopt all sanctions already imposed on Russia by the EU. “This is a big step for Switzerland,” said the country’s president, Ignazio Cassis. In addition to sanctions, the US and several EU countries have announced they will send Stinger missiles and other military supplies to Ukraine. Germany has said it will also increase defence spending massively, casting off decades of reluctance. For the first time in its history, the EU is financing the purchase and delivery of weapons to a country under attack, providing €500m of military equipment to the Ukrainian armed forces in a move described as a “watershed moment”. EU defence ministers were due to meet later on Monday to discuss delivery logistics. Nato partners are also providing Ukraine with air-defence missiles and anti-tank weapons, the alliance’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, tweeted on Monday. Peskov doubled down on Monday on the Kremlin’s logic for sending Russian forces into Ukraine, saying western arms supplies showed that Moscow was right to try to demilitarise its neighbour and accusing the EU of hostile behaviour. Russia’s growing diplomatic isolation continued, with the UN human rights council agreeing on Monday to Ukraine’s request to hold an urgent debate on the invasion after Kyiv’s envoy said some of Moscow’s actions “may amount to war crimes”. As Putin dedenounced the US and its allies as “an empire of lies”, a senior US official, Bonnie Jenkins, said there “must be consequences for Russia’s unprovoked war. The world is watching and we will hold Russia accountable.” Zelenskiy on Monday also asked the EU to allow Ukraine membership of the bloc immediately, saying in a video statement that the country’s goal was “to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I am sure we deserve it.” The EU said it was is expecting Ukraine’s application “imminently”, which officials in Brussels said “would need to be assessed very rapidly by the council, and a decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the European Commission”. The US president, Joe Biden, will host a call with allies and partners on Monday, the White House said. The US on Sunday said Putin was escalating the war with “dangerous rhetoric”, in particular over Russia’s nuclear posture. Western officials believe Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine’s government and replace it with a puppet regime. His instructions on Sunday for Russian nuclear readiness raised fears that the invasion could lead to nuclear war by design or mistake. Rolling protests have been held around the world against the invasion, including in Russia, where almost 6,000 people have been detained at anti-war protests since Thursday, the OVD-Info protest monitoring group said.",News/World news,Russian rocket strikes kill dozens in Kharkiv as Kyiv-Moscow talks begin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/russian-rocket-strikes-kill-dozens-in-kharkiv-as-ukraine-russia-talks-begin
3/1/2022,"Belarus may be preparing to send its soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion, perhaps as soon as this week, according to a US defence official, amid mounting concern about Minsk’s military preparations. Belarus has already been used as a staging post by Russian forces, who gathered there on the pretext of joint military exercises before last week’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now there is increasing evidence that Minsk may be moving towards becoming an explicit participant in the war. On Monday it announced it was revoking its non-nuclear status after a referendum, allowing Russian weapons to be placed in Belarus. The move provoked rare protests in the country. Last week the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, was allowing his country to become a Russian satellite state, and on Sunday night the US official said: “It’s very clear Minsk is now an extension of the Kremlin.” Russian and Ukrainian delegations were due to hold talks about the conflict in southern Belarus, near the Ukrainian border, on Monday. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said on the Telegram app that his delegation had arrived, including the defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, a close adviser to the president and the deputy foreign minister. “The key issue of the negotiations is an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of troops from the territory of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy’s office said. On Monday images appeared on social media that it was claimed showed a convoy of the 38th Air Assault Brigade of the Belarusian army near Kobryn in Belarus’s Brest region already displaying what were said to be “friendly force” identification markers used to avoid fratricide between allied forces. Alarming video from the western part of the Belarusian-Ukrainian border. A convoy of 38th Air Assault Brigade of the Belarusian army (not Russian) near Kobryn in Brest region. Most of the vehicles are marked with red squares - makes sense if Lukashenko is about to join the war. pic.twitter.com/mKZr7frDoD Images have emerged in recent days of trains loaded with tanks reportedly arriving in the city of Brest in south-west Belarus and there have been reports of missile and aircraft launches from within Belarus. Commenting on the new buildup on the Belarusian side of the border, Gustav Gressel from the European Council on Foreign Relations said: “This was to be expected, part of Putin’s plan B. More brute force.” He questioned the utility to Russia of active Belarusian military forces on the ground. “I have some doubts about their effectiveness and morale. They had issues with desertion since 2020. So let’s see. Let’s also see where they are deployed. Will they try to cut off the Polish border? Or will they advance on Kyiv?” On Sunday, Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian internal affairs minister, said Iskander missiles had been launched from Belarus towards Ukraine. “The launch of Iskanders across Ukraine from Mozyr region. Launch around 1700,” he wrote on Telegram. He posted a video showing a missile being fired reportedly towards the Rivne region bordering Belarus. Zelenskiy appealed to Belarus on Sunday to stay out of Russia’s war. “In the war that is going on now, you are not on the same side with us,” he said in a recorded message. “From your territory, the troops of the Russian Federation launch rockets into Ukraine. “Our children are being killed from your territory, our houses are being destroyed, they are trying to blow up everything that has been built over decades – and, by the way, not only by us, but also by our fathers, our grandfathers. “And all this is also a de facto referendum for you, Belarusians. You decide who you are. You decide who to be. How will you look into the eyes of your children, how will you look into the eyes of each other, your neighbours. We are your neighbours. We are Ukrainians. Be Belarus, not Russia. You are making this choice right today.” About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status. The vote sparked the biggest protests in months as thousands took to the streets. Lukashenko has imposed a sweeping crackdown on dissent after a contested election challenged his grip on power in 2020. The vote to change the constitution, passed by 65%, according to official data, could lead to the return of nuclear weapons to Belarusian territory for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. “If you [the west] transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,” Lukashenko said.",News/World news,"Belarus may be about to send its troops into Ukraine, US official says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/belarus-troops-ukraine-russia-invasion
3/1/2022,"The debate continues to rage among Wordle players: has the New York Times ruined it? Why are there suddenly so many double-letter days (SWILL, seriously?); so many frustrating solutions that hinge on a single, ambiguous letter? And what about “caulk”? Has something changed? Or are people just losing interest? Since Wordle caught the world’s attention, there has been a fast-flowing stream of copycats and humorous takes on the word-guessing game, based on everything from swearing (Sweardle) to choral music (Byrdle) to geography (Worldle). If you’re looking for something different, though, rather than just an inventive twist on the same theme, the Android and Apple app stores have many other word games you can play on your phone. Fans have been quietly enjoying some of these for years – some offer a daily five or 10 minutes of puzzle fun, while others let you sink as much time into them as you want. SpellTower is an inspired combination of Boggle and Tetris, in which players make words out of adjacent letter tiles in order to clear the play space. In the puzzle mode, subsequent layers of letters are continually added until the pile reaches the top of the screen and the game ends. It’s a unique and compelling test of both your vocabulary and your spatial planning skills, and like Wordle it gets you to see words as tactical objects as well as units of language. This is a really fascinating take on Scrabble, which gives you a selection of words and then challenges you to place them on the board without running out of playable spaces. It sounds easy, but if you add too many words in one corner you can soon come adrift, and you have to make careful use of the premium squares. Scrabble fans will enjoy the way the game explores word placement strategies, and success unlocks the more demanding “precise mode”, which requires players to finish on a specific square. Not for the faint-hearted. As much a logic game as a word game, this endearingly lo-fi puzzler has you shifting words around to change the rules. Unshiftable boulders can be pushed aside if you create the sentence ROCK IS MOVE; if there’s a key hidden down a maze, try KEY IS YOU and you can possess it and move it somewhere more accessible. It will outsmart you, but it will also make you feel like a genius when you crack it. A kind of slightly violent Scrabble, in Letter Quest, you guide a cute little grim reaper through dungeons full of monsters, defeating them by conjuring impressive words from a panel of letter tiles. Any word will do damage, but the fun comes from figuring out particularly appropriate or long ones; there’s nothing quite as satisfying as defeating a werewolf with “silver”. It’s a lovely combination of word puzzles and old-school dungeon-delving adventure. Anyone who played the fondly remembered Bookworm Adventures, sadly now scrubbed from existence, will especially enjoy this. In this gently bizarre, free game, you unscramble words from a hexagonal grid of letters to send little armies of exploding cats towards your opponent’s house. It’s quite frantic, rather than contemplative, and more fun against a friend (or a stranger) online, but there’s a single-player mode too, featuring surreal interactive comics. This is not unlike Wordle – there’s a word that the game wants you to guess, and you have to puzzle it out – but this gives you a slot machine wheel of different letters, and you spin each column around with your finger until something makes sense. It also has a mode where you have to figure out several words from crossword-style clues, working with what you’re given. There’s something very satisfying about the tactile nature of Typeshift, like playing with a padlock combination made of letters. This is much cuter and weirder than anything you’ll find in a newspaper puzzle app – it features little collectible square-headed bears, and making longer, better words out of the letter grid in front of you creates more, bigger bears. It pairs word-building with the human appetite for collecting things. The words you’ve spelled then get made into absurd cartoons after every round. It’s very funny and adorable, and appealing enough to draw kids into some spelling-related fun.",Arts/Games,"Worldle, Sweardle, Byrdle?

3/1/2022,"Police leaders in England and Wales will decide not to accept that their forces are still institutionally racist, as they try to battle their way out of a race crisis. Chief constables began considering a public admission in December and have held a series of private meetings among forces to try to find agreement. Multiple sources with knowledge of discussions say plans expected to be released in March by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) will contain no acceptance that institutional racism should be admitted. Experts in racing and police warn a failure to admit institutional racism will damage already weak confidence among black communities in policing. Policing was first labelled as institutionally racist in the 1999 Macpherson report on failings that let the racist killers of the black student Stephen Lawrence escape justice for so long. A series of continuing crises over race, and official statistics showing black people are more likely to face coercive powers such as force and stop and search, led police chiefs to vow change, and to boost black confidence which runs lower than white. Sir Dave Thompson, chief of the West Midlands who is leading for police chiefs on the race plan, told the Guardian: “We have discussed it [institutional racism] quite a lot. Chiefs have expressed their views. I think it is quite difficult to get a universal view.” Thompson said some chiefs viewed it as an “incendiary term”, unfairly tarnishing policing which is unhelpful: “It becomes a term to say that everything is broken.” Among those opposing any admission of institutional racism were Britain’s biggest force, the Metropolitan police, as well as Greater Manchester police. Those in favour include Avon and Somerset, but a consensus was needed and will not be found, multiple sources with knowledge of the discussions say. Since the Black Lives Matters protests that erupted across the UK in 2020 after the murder by US police of George Floyd, police chiefs in Britain have been under pressure. They have been working on a plan to lessen the enduring problems they have on race. Chiefs are expected to commit to being an “anti-racist” police service, but what that means is yet to be defined. Police leaders will have a special meeting on 15 March, with their long awaited race plan released later in March in draft form, which will then go out for a fuller consultation. One senior chief constable criticised the plan: “It has a bureaucratic style. It saps my will to live, it’s very aspirational, and there are no targets.” Another source described the plan so far as “woeful” and “just platitudes”. One chief constable was more positive: “It’s alright as a start”, adding consensus on the most controversial points such as institutional racism had been elusive. Among plans in draft form, are greater collection of data, including of traffic stops. The Met has started doing that as a pilot. Also there are plans for greater mentorship for those ethnic minority officers who have joined, and mapping where ethnic minority officers are in the police hierarchy. This is hoped to show whether they are stuck at the junior ranks and assess their progression against white colleagues. Victor Olisa, former head of diversity at Scotland Yard, said failing to admit institutional racism would be a serious error: “If it doesn’t then their credibility which is very weak now, will get even weaker. The black community will believe that senior officers do not care about solving the issues of race. “If you don’t accept it, you reject it and just carry on as before.” Veteran campaigner Stafford Scott from Tottenham Rights, said British police had got worse on race since the BLM protests almost two years ago. “Institutional racism is a cancer that spreads. Unless you identify it you are not going to address to cure it and it is just going to spread. It will become further embedded and institutionalised. “No black person should engage with them unless they acknowledge institutional racism.” Police chiefs appointed a barrister, Abimbola Johnson, to chair an independent board to scrutinise their plans.",News/UK news,England and Wales police bosses will not admit to institutional racism in their forces,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/england-and-wales-police-bosses-will-not-admit-to-institutional-racism-in-their-forces
3/1/2022,"Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation this century are far higher than previously thought, doubling in just two decades and continuing to accelerate, according to a study. The world’s forests form an enormous carbon store, holding an estimated 861 gigatons of carbon – equivalent to nearly a century’s worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate. When trees are cut down, they release the carbon they store into the atmosphere. Since 2000, the world has lost about 10% of its tree cover, becoming a major driver of global heating. Yet, despite being the second largest human source of greenhouse gases after fossil fuels, the carbon accounting behind emissions from land still contains significant uncertainties, often relying on limited data that poses difficulties for researchers tracking progress towards meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. A study published on Monday in Nature Sustainability shows that carbon loss from tropical deforestation in the last two decades has doubled and continues to rise, driven largely by the expansion of agricultural frontiers. The findings contrast with previous assessments, such as the Global Carbon Budget 2021, which had suggested a slight decline in carbon loss from deforestation. Using high-resolution satellite data, researchers found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia and Brazil recorded the largest acceleration in forest loss from 2001 to 2020, with the South American country responsible for the largest total emissions from clearing in the Amazon and other forest ecosystems. The analysis found that about a fifth of land clearing in the tropics took place in mountainous regions, which are home to relatively high carbon stocks, especially in Asia. “Deforestation and forest carbon loss are accelerating. There is a massive gulf between where we want to get to and where we are going, which is really worrying,” says Dominick Spracklen, a professor at the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds, who co-authored the study. The increase took place despite commitments to slow deforestation, such as the New York Declaration on Forests in 2014, which aimed to halve deforestation rates by 2020. At Cop26 in Glasgow, a coalition of 142 countries – accounting for more than 90% of the world’s forests – committed to halting and reversing forest loss and land degradation by 2030. “The standard methods used by the IPCC are not spotting some of the things we’ve seen in this paper, such as small-scale deforestation and the movement of land-clearing into mountains. They aren’t really capturing the trend that we’ve seen in the last two decades,” Spracklen added. The research was led by Yu Feng, a PhD candidate at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and Zhenzhong Zeng, associate professor at SUSTech. “Tropical forests are huge stores of carbon. We must reduce deforestation to slow global warming,” said Yu Feng. Cattle farming, palm oil, soy, cocoa, rubber and coffee are all leading causes of tropical forest loss, destroying some of the most biodiverse places on Earth, home to species including jaguars, sloths, orang-utans, toucans and lemurs. On Monday, an IPCC report warned climate breakdown was accelerating rapidly and said many of the impacts would be more severe than predicted, with only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages. Satellite monitoring is playing an increasingly important role in tracking greenhouse gases on Earth, such as those monitoring methane emissions. For forests, Global Forest Watch hosts satellite data tracking forest loss, and projects such as Nasa’s Gedi mission, which uses lasers to analyse the biomass of trees, is helping provide a more accurate map of the world’s forests and carbon stores.

3/1/2022,"We now know that Ukrainians mean to fight the Russian invasion with determination and bravery. In that fight they must have support. We cannot fail to admire fellow Europeans as they take up weapons to defend their country against meaningless aggression. But what does support mean? The British government disagrees with many Ukrainians that it shares the same threat and should join the same fight. With Vladimir Putin in his possibly deranged state, the resulting paranoia and slaughter would play into his hands. It would be truly appalling and, on present evidence, risk a catastrophe that is as uncertain as it is unjustified. Britain has rightly joined the rest of Europe in expressing its horror. But when the British government was called on to do more than signal virtue and by admitting possibly thousands of Ukrainian refugees, the Home Office reverted to type. Boris Johnson announced that relaxed visa rules would only apply to immediate family members and the immigration minister, Kevin Foster, suggested others could perhaps apply for visas as fruit-pickers. Though he later deleted this cynical tweet, it showed that when push comes to shove Whitehall’s “hostile environment” is instinctive and its support for Ukraine all but hollow. Otherwise there are economic sanctions, the capitalist equivalent of medieval siege and famine. Their severity has been impressive, showing Britain united with Europe and the US against evil. The trouble is that, unlike famine, history shows almost no sign of sanctions achieving their desired aim. The present measures will, as usual, hurt the poor rather than the rich, and benefit such bystanders as Chinese tycoons and the gas and oil giants. The edifice of dictatorship is largely immune to the subtleties of markets, exchanges and visa bans. Heavily sanctioned nations, including Iran, North Korea, Cuba and Syria, currently show little sign of regime change. If anything, sanctions entrench power. This is Putin’s war, not Russia’s, but how can Russia speak? The justification for sanctioning its economy, banks, travel, sports teams and cosmopolitan diaspora is that this will somehow persuade Putin of the error of his ways, that he has made a terrible misjudgment. I have seen no account of how this is supposed to happen. Do we intend for Russians to suddenly do what they have not done for a century and rebel and topple him? Will a Claus von Stauffenberg-style conspiracy storm the Kremlin, or a posse of cronies cart him off to an asylum? As for how long this will take, the west – and especially Britain – should know how hard it is for a proud regime to withdraw its unwarranted aggression against a supposedly weak state, and how vacuous its excuses become. In Putin’s pathetic explanation of his Ukraine invasion at the weekend, I heard echoes of the west’s war in Afghanistan, when we were told that the British army was killing Pashtuns in Helmand to keep people safe on the streets of Britain. It took Britain years to admit defeat and leave. Is Ukraine – and Russia – to wait that long for Putin to die or fall off his perch? Realpolitik says that somehow Putin must be induced to withdraw his armies and admit that his “buffer-zone” strategy has failed. Mediation must find some form of words to cover his retreat, however painful those words may be for some to swallow. Ukraine and Russia must live as neighbours once more, as geography has required them to do throughout history. The alternative is for Kyiv to suffer years of occupation and puppet government, until liberal voices within Russia persuade whoever occupies the Kremlin to relent. Those voices are what everyone – Ukraine, Russia and the rest of Europe – most desperately need just now. They will require not ostracism and hostility from the west but contact, friendship and encouragement. Someday, preferably soon, the signalling has to stop and serious diplomacy resume.

3/1/2022,"A Russian oil tanker was moored at Milford Haven in south Wales on Monday, even as the government said it was considering sanctions to “restrict access” to British ports in the light of the war in Ukraine. Pluto, a crude-oil tanker delivering supplies from Primorsk – which accounts for 30% of Russian oil exports – arrived in the UK on 26 February, where it remained on Monday morning. Milford Haven is the closest port to the Pembroke oil refinery, owned by the US energy firm Valero, which supplies petrol, diesel and jet fuel to the British market. The Guardian has approached Valero for comment on whether Pluto has been offloading oil for use in its refinery. The vessel’s next destination is Derry, Northern Ireland, according to information from the marine traffic website VesselFinder. Another ship, NS Champion, operated by the Russian state-owned shipping company Sovcomflot, is due to dock at the Flotta oil terminal in Orkney at 6pm on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport indicated that such deliveries could be included within a fresh package of sanctions due to be announced on Monday. “We are aware of concerns about Russian-connected ships potentially docking in the UK and we are working rapidly to explore a range of measures to restrict access for them,” said the spokesperson. “We are already discussing this issue with the Scottish government and the sanctions being considered are part of a wider package being worked up across the UK government.” About 3% of UK gas demand is fulfilled by shipments of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG), a super-chilled form of gas that can be transported by sea. Terminals at Milford Haven and the Isle of Grain, Kent, have taken multiple consignments of LNG this month, including from the vast Yamal facility in northern Siberia, opened by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in 2017.",News/Business,Russian oil tanker docked in Wales even as UK moves to restrict access,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/russia-oil-tanker-docked-in-wales-even-as-uk-moves-to-restrict-access-ukraine-sanctions
3/1/2022,"A bonfire of EU shibboleths on the economy, conflict, finance, energy supply, migration, and even the bloc’s future shape and size, has been lit by the conflict raging in Ukraine. Battlefield images, the leadership of Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has framed the war as being between European democracy and brute bullying power, and the challenge of coordinating with UK and US allies who are pushing for more while having less to lose, has created a new political necessity. The standard rational actor analysis of economic interests has gone by the wayside. And while during normal times, the EU’s deep economic ties with Russia had been a liability, with countries fearful of upsetting the Kremlin, those ties now offer leverage unmatched anywhere else in the world. And the EU is going all in. By cutting off Russian banks from the Swift payments system, not only is the country’s industrial base losing access to foreign currency but Russian citizens’ individual credit card transactions are blocked. Combined with freezing most of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves, the EU has made a political decision to force a deep recession on the Russian economy, with the hurt and pain that will be felt by Europeans as a result becoming a political irrelevance. Sacred cow No 1 slain. But so much more has followed. The EU will ask states to grant asylum to Ukrainian refugees for up to three years, using a legal instrument that exists but which has never been triggered. Countries who have baulked at taking in refugees have opened up their borders. So much for sacred cow No 2. This is no act of universal humanism, as those from Afghanistan and elsewhere who have been seeking to cross from Ukraine within the general population have discovered. But the decision has wider consequences. With large numbers of Ukrainians settling in EU member states, there will be a new familiarity with the people of that country, while those who may later complain of overcrowding will be under obligation to help rebuild Ukraine as a place to which the displaced will want to return. EU officials say they expect Ukraine’s application for EU membership “imminently”. There is an expectation that the process of accession will be sped up. Croatia was the last country to join the EU in 2013 and there has been little appetite to open up again. Sacred cow No 3 is on its way out. Then there is the EU’s arrival on the scene as a funder of lethal weaponry for a nation at war, a “quantum leap” beyond anything we have seen”, said Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. In Germany, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, abandoned the country’s postwar approach to conflict by announcing €100bn (£83.7bn) Sondervermögen (special assets) to rearm. Since Ostpolitik, the normalisation of relations between then West Germany and the east, policy been predicated upon Russia being a status quo power, not an imperialist one. Berlin’s mercantilist approach had to go, along with sacred cow No 4. Asked as to the turning point in EU thinking, officials point to an “historic” intervention by Zelenskiy last Thursday evening. Sitting around the leaders’ table in the Europa building in Brussels at about 8pm, the 27 heads of state and government had been ready to agree a set of strong sanctions on Russia. There had been calls for more drastic action in the face the extraordinary scenes developing in Ukraine but on his arrival, Scholz told reporters that he preferred to be cautious. A couple of hours later and Zelenskiy, speaking from Kyiv via videocall to the assembled leaders, changed everything. “It was an incredibly emotional intervention,” said one of those present. “And I don’t mean by that President Zelenskiy lost his control if you like. It was incredibly professional. “He spoke about how he was the No 1 target for Russia, and that he felt this may well be the last time that he would be able to speak personally to many of the leaders. “He spoke about the threat his own family faced. And I think that focused minds and, in my humble opinion, it was a historic moment.” There is a step further to go. Europe remains reliant on Russian gas. But EU officials say watch this space. In January, the record was broken for deliveries of liquified natural gas and more is on its way, with discussions with Japan and Korea about redirecting deliveries from Qatar ongoing. Ursula von der Leyen has said there is sufficient gas stored to get through the winter. If the last week has shown anything, it is that turning off the Russian pipes will not be seen as a sacred cow too far.",News/World news,Ukraine conflict leads EU to rid itself of Russian sacred cows ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ukraine-conflict-leads-eu-to-rid-itself-of-russian-sacred-cows
3/1/2022,"The price comparison website Comparethemarket has pulled its ads featuring the animated Russian meerkat Aleksandr Orlov from news bulletins in light of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The company – which spent an estimated £90m on marketing in the UK over the last year, about two-thirds of which was on TV campaigns – said it had reviewed its media plan to make sure the ads did not appear around content such as news bulletins on the Ukrainian conflict. “The Comparethemarket meerkats are fictional characters,” said a spokesperson for the company, which is owned by the Peterborough-based financial services firm BGL. “They have no association with Russia and the current situation. We are continually reviewing our advertising to ensure we’re being sensitive to the current situation.” The ads – which feature Orlov, a Russian billionaire meerkat from Moscow and his sidekick, Sergei – have run since 2009 and have been instrumental in taking the 16-year-old company from also-ran status to one of the top comparison sites in the UK. Orlov’s catchphrase, “simples”, became so widespread it was included in the Collins English Dictionary in 2010. The character – who is voiced by Simon Greenall, perhaps best known as Michael the geordie handyman from I’m Alan Partridge – competes against other catchy creations in the price comparison sector including Gocompare’s opera singer Gio Compario, played by the Welsh singer Wynne Evans. The invasion of Ukraine has put the spotlight on firms using or selling products that might be associated with the conflict or Russia. Last week, British supermarkets came under pressure on social media to rename chicken kievs to “kyivs” to show solidarity with Ukraine, whose capital is Kyiv in Ukrainian, Kiev in Russian. The US restaurant chain Applebee’s was forced to pull a lighthearted promotional TV ad campaign after CNN aired it as part of a split screen as news coverage showed air raid sirens being sounded in the Ukrainian capital. “Brands need to be aware of context, the tone and timing of advertising,” said Dave Barnett, the managing director of the media agency December 19. “It isn’t just about whether an ad or piece of marketing has a direct connection to a conflict or event. Context is king, this has always been true, but never more so than when there is a major world event happening.”",News/Media,Comparethemarket pulls meerkat ads from TV news after Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/28/comparethemarket-meerkat-ads-tv-ukraine-russian-aleksandr-orlov
3/1/2022,"Patient safety will be harmed and victims of medical negligence denied justice because of flaws in the government’s health and care bill, the NHS ombudsman has told the Guardian. Rob Behrens, the parliamentary and health service ombudsman, fears he and his staff will not be able to get to the bottom of clinical blunders because under the bill he will be denied potentially vital information collected by the NHS’s Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB). The ombudsman said the legislation would allow the HSIB to “operate behind a curtain of secrecy” and undermine his own investigations into lapses in patient safety and could deny grieving families the full truth about why a loved one died. Behrens has spoken out because he is concerned about government plans for NHS staff involved in an incident to give evidence about mistakes privately in a “safe space” to the HSIB, which cannot be shared with anyone else except coroners. His exclusion from seeing material gathered in that way could force him to take the agency to the high court toaccess it, he said. “If the ‘safe space’ provisions become law as drafted there is a real risk to patient safety and to justice for those who deserve it. This is a crisis of accountability and scrutiny,” he said. The HSIB, set up in 2017 by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to improve patient safety after the Mid Staffordshire NHS trust scandal, is on course to be put on a legislative footing and renamed the Health Service Safety Investigations Body (HSSIB) in the bill. Both the HSIB and ombudsman publish reports into areas of inadequate NHS care, such as care of people with learning disabilities. “By barring the ombudsman from the information needed to do an effective job the government will be allowing HSSIB to operate behind a curtain of secrecy. It would be a curious anomaly and poor use of taxpayers’ money if two public bodies have to face up in court to get documents handed over,” Behrens said. Julia Neuberger, a crossbench peer who chairs University College hospitals NHS trust, has tabled an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords seeking to give the ombudsman access to information obtained via “safe space” processes. Unless ministers rethink the plan “there could be serious consequences for members of the public who use the ombudsman service”, she recently told a Lords debate. “If the ombudsman is unable to investigate robustly all aspects of complaints about the NHS, except with the permission of the high court, patients may find it harder to get access to justice. The NHS may well become less accountable for its system failings,” she said. Allowing coroners but not the ombudsman access to HSSIB material “does not make sense”, she said. However, Barbara Young, a former chair of the Care Quality Commission, backed the plan and warned that NHS staff would not give evidence to the HSSIB if that information were then shared with the ombudsman. “Any disclosure of protected material to another party represents a risk to the safe space. It would have a chilling effect, preventing people coming forward to HSSIB and therefore making it less able to improve patient safety,” she said. Another peer, Terence Etherton, a leading lawyer and the master of the rolls until last year, is also urging a U-turn. The plan would impede the ombudsman’s work, undermine his independent, non-judicial constitutional role and breach the UK’s obligations as a member of the Council of Europe and UN to support the work of ombudsmen, he said. It was “an incomprehensible inconsistency” to deny the ombudsman information given to coroners, he added. The Lords is due to debate Lady Neuberger’s amendment later this week.

3/1/2022,"A woman has been left to sleep in her wheelchair several nights a week and remain in bed for the rest of it due to a lack of social care in her local area. Mandy Page, 53, who lives alone in Hove, has difficulty getting into and out of bed on her own and previously had carers to provide support in the morning and evenings. However, since before Christmas she has had no care support in the evenings after the MyLife East Sussex agency told her it was no longer covering her care, and that the agency believed her care was now being provided by her local authority. Page receives dialysis three times a week at Royal Sussex county hospital, and on those days arrives home, by hospital transport, after 6pm. This means that without help getting out of her wheelchair and into bed she must sleep in the wheelchair. “It’s very stressful, because at the moment I’m in bed every day. I can’t get up without help, and I can’t get back to bed on a dialysis day,” Page said. “On a dialysis day, I go to dialysis and I’m in my wheelchair. Every other day, I’m in bed all day and all night. That’s no life. Page’s situation exemplifies the crisis in social care. England has faced chronic shortages of care workers, with a survey by Care England finding that 95% of care providers struggle to recruit and retain staff. In 2020/21, there were around 105,000 vacancies at any one time in the social care sector, and more than a third of the sector’s staff left their jobs during the year. Page says the lack of adequate social care has taken a negative toll on her quality of life, and has meant she hasn’t been able to undertake everyday tasks. “It just makes me angry, because I’ve got no life at the moment. At all. The only time I’m up is when I go to dialysis. I can’t go out, I can’t go to the shops,” she said. “I’m due an eye test, but I can’t even go to that because I can’t get out of bed. I think it’s disgusting, it’s not fair. Why should we suffer because the care agencies aren’t getting the people in?” Rob Persey, the executive director for health and adult social care at Brighton and Hove council, said the council had not been able to source a new provider for Page since her earlier care was withdrawn. “This is a national as well as a local problem as there are insufficient home care staff to meet demands. Various local initiatives, including additional funding, have been taken to increase the home care workforce, but so far they have only had a limited impact. “We recognise Mandy does not want respite care, and acknowledge this is a completely unacceptable situation for her,” he said. MyLife East Sussex said it had given “due notice” to Brighton and Hove council when Page’s care was stopped last year. Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, Page’s constituency, said: “When I think of Mandy sleeping in her wheelchair, I think how upset I would be if this was my own mother, and it’s heartbreaking.” “The government has lived in cloud cuckoo land over this issue right from the start of Brexit. Everyone knew that sectors such as care-working would be severely hit by the new rules and there would be a chronic staff shortage, and yet the government ploughed on and wouldn’t listen. “Social care’s contribution to our society should be a source of national pride, yet the current social care system is in crisis and not fit for purpose. Too many people are going without the care they need and, like Mandy, left in pain, worrying about their treatments and shamefully abandoned.”",News/Society,Sussex woman forced to sleep in wheelchair due to lack of care staff,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/28/sussex-woman-hove-forced-to-sleep-in-wheelchair-care-staff-shortage
3/1/2022,"At the border between Ukraine and Poland, handwritten signs greet exhausted refugees staggering towards safety. Local people are coming out to offer not just words of welcome but practical help; beds in their own homes or lifts to anywhere refugees might have relatives, even if it’s hundreds of miles away. Car hire firms are making free vehicles available, while off-duty firefighters and teenage scouts help bewildered families at train stations. Eastern Europeans who lived through the cold war need no help grasping the magnitude of what is happening to their neighbours. But they are not alone. Ireland scrapped visa requirements for Ukrainians as war broke out and the EU as a whole is expected to offer the right to settle for three years without applying for asylum. Contrast that compassion with Britain’s foot-dragging contribution to this particular war effort, which by the weekend had amounted to a tone deaf (and hastily deleted) tweet from immigration minister Kevin Foster suggesting refugees could always try to get fruit-picking jobs here, followed by a belated announcement from Boris Johnson that Ukrainians living in Britain could apply for some relatives to join them. The Scottish and Welsh administrations are itching to go further, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, suggested on Monday afternoon that the government could now create some form of “humanitarian route”, although offered little clarity about who might qualify. But having made the right early calls on economic sanctions and arming Ukraine, Johnson’s government clearly misjudged the public mood on refugees. He has underestimated British generosity now, just as he repeatedly underestimated the selflessness people would show during a pandemic. It’s an oddly revealing blind spot to have. For this war has got under our collective skin. Britons are gripped not only by the human tragedies unfolding, but by the courage and resilience that ordinary Ukrainians have shown, under a president whose resolve to endure whatever his people endure alongside them makes us long for inspiring leadership. Teenagers are following Zelenskiy’s updates on Instagram and TikTok, their imaginations captured by stories of heroic resistance, even as their parents collect up old clothes and toys to send to refugees. The sea of blue and yellow visible in the stands when Chelsea played Liverpool at the weekend might feel like an empty gesture but it’s telling ministers something urgent about the national mood. When readers of the Daily Mail group titles raise a quarter of a million pounds in a day for a refugee appeal, it’s clear where middle England’s feelings lie. Some will ask bitterly if it’s just because they’re white that fleeing Ukrainians seem to evoke more sympathy than people crossing the Channel in sinking boats. But the resentment stirred against eastern Europeans during the runup to Brexit, when Nigel Farage openly suggested he would feel “uncomfortable” having Romanian neighbours and Poles living in Britain suffered hate crimes, suggests it’s not that simple; so too does public support in 2015 for resettling Syrian migrants in Britain. The truth is that public opinion is unpredictable, contradictory, and prone to emotional swings. People still respond viscerally to the sight of fellow human beings fleeing a war, perhaps especially when they feel guilty about not wanting to intervene militarily. Good leadership is about seizing the moment when events are pushing people in a benevolent direction, not lagging sulkily behind the times. As the moderate Tory Reform Group argued in a statement calling for the Home Office to waive most, if not all, visa restrictions, in a humanitarian crisis “how we respond says much about the humanity of our own country”. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, suggested on Monday morning that Britain was hesitating because the EU might prefer to keep refugees on the borders of neighbouring countries, from where they can easily return home once it’s safe. But that’s a strategy for a short and limited conflict, not for what may become a long and bloody siege war in which any occupation would be followed by a bitter insurgency. The UN refugee agency is braced for up to 4 million refugees. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has rightly warned that we could be in this for the long haul. Across Europe, governments are visibly recognising that like 9/11, this is one of those moments that shake the kaleidoscope. Germany has already made a historic shift, abandoning a postwar position on rearmament that was taken for reasons which still emotionally resonate today. Switzerland, long the world’s most accommodating banker, is joining economic sanctions. Historically neutral Sweden is arming Ukraine. The EU has shaken off its reputation for painfully slow, bureaucratic decision-making, taking bold leaps on sanctions, the supply of weapons and the idea of Ukrainian accession to the EU. Old beliefs and practices that no longer fit the times are being shed at speed and Britain should not be so arrogant as to think it is exempt. The country senses it, even if its leader does not.

3/1/2022,"Law firms working to stop Russian oligarchs getting hit by UK sanctions could themselves be targeted by financial curbs, No 10 has suggested as it warned them to “think very carefully” before propping up those allied to Vladimir Putin’s regime. Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson said Russia “must be treated like a pariah state” and warned City legal firms, accountants and banks that they should not be supporting allies of the Russian regime. The Foreign Office has revealed that it has been sent numerous legal letters by firms representing oligarchs and companies seeking to avoid sanctions amid the Ukraine crisis. Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP, has called on the government to “name and shame” law firms involved in lobbying on behalf of the financial interests of Russian clients seeking to avoid sanctions but the government has so far refused to reveal any names. Asked on Monday whether those law firms could themselves be sanctioned, Downing Street said: “We will certainly keep all options under review ... This is an incredibly serious situation and we want to take all possible steps to ratchet up the pressure on Putin and his regime to get him to step back from this path. “Individuals and businesses seeking to facilitate that regime and Putin’s actions to continue down this path of violence we think should step back from that as well.” Johnson’s spokesperson added that businesses should “think very carefully if they are still continuing to do anything that props up the Putin regime”. He also said the sanctions were intended to bring down the Putin regime – but quickly clarified that he had misspoken and meant to say they were aiming to “inflict financial pain on Putin and his regime, to stymie the Russian war machine as it attempts to subjugate a democratic European country”. “We are not seeking anything in terms of regime change. What we are talking about here clearly is how we seek to stop Russia subjugating a democratic country. That’s been the message throughout. This is about preventing an unwarranted attack. We believe that no one should be supporting in any way or propping up in any way the efforts by Putin’s regime,” he added. The spokesperson said further sanctions against Russian individuals and businesses could be expected in coming days after a raft of measures since Russia invaded Ukraine on Thursday. Asked whether Russian oligarchs should use their positions of influence to speak out against Putin, he said: “I wouldn’t seek to single out individuals but certainly we think everyone should be united in condemnation of actions Putin has taken.” Earlier on Monday, Evgeny Lebedev appealed to Putin to stop the invasion of Ukraine, through his Evening Standard newspaper. The Russian-born crossbench peer and friend of the prime minister, who owns the London-focused Evening Standard alongside the Independent, used the front page to write an open letter to the Russian leader. “I plead with you to use today’s negotiations to bring this terrible conflict in Ukraine to an end,” he said. “On this page are the final minutes of a six-year-old child fatally injured by shells that struck her Mariupol apartment block on Sunday. “She is still wearing her pink jacket as medics fight to save her. But it is too late. Other children, and other families, are suffering similar fates across Ukraine. As a Russian citizen I plead with you to stop Russians killing their Ukrainian brothers and sisters. “As a British citizen I ask you to save Europe from war. As a Russian patriot I plead that you prevent any more young Russian soldiers from dying needlessly. As a citizen of the world I ask you to save the world from annihilation.” Separately, Lubov Chernukhin, a major Conservative party donor, wife of Putin’s former finance minister and a former banker, told the Daily Telegraph she “would like to condemn all Russian military aggression in Ukraine in the strongest way possible”. “While such flagrant acts of war are shocking, one cannot say that there were no warning signs,” she said. “Over the last two decades, Putin’s despotic regime has degraded to Stalinesque persecution of the Russian people, brutally shutting down any political opposition or independent press and presiding over the catastrophic impoverishment of Russian citizens – whilst Putin and his clique continue to enrich themselves at the expense of the Russian people.“I support the UK government’s decisive response to Russia’s actions and I call for the strongest possible sanctions against Putin’s regime and its enablers. I remain hopeful that the UK and its global allies will continue to stand up to the Kremlin and to protect Ukraine and its people, now engulfed in the horrors of war.”",News/World news,"UK law firms aiding Russian oligarchs could face penalties, No 10 suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/uk-law-firms-aiding-russian-oligarchs-could-face-penalties-no-10-suggests
3/1/2022,"A senior official has admitted the government knew 15 years before the Grenfell Tower disaster that plastic-filled cladding panels – which fuelled the fatal fire – burned “fast and fierce” and he believed they should not be used on tall buildings. But the results of tests were not published, and on Monday Anthony Burd, the principal fire safety professional and later head of technical policy in the government’s building regulations division from 2000 to 2013, denied there was a cover-up. The taxpayer-funded tests showed the cladding panels failed “catastrophically”, with flames reaching 20 metres into the air within five minutes. Similar panels went on to be used on more than 400 high-rise blocks, including Grenfell, where they were the main cause of the spread of the fire on 14 June 2017 that killed 72 people. Burd said the results should have been published but denied that this did not happen because the government feared it would trigger “an immediate cladding crisis” and was afraid of the response of the companies who made the materials. He told the inquiry that the damning results had instead “fallen down between the department and Building Research Establishment”, which the government commissioned to test 14 cladding systems in large-scale fires, including five with rainscreen panels, all of which failed. Nor did the government investigate how many buildings may already have been built with the material, and the test results were not made available for a review of fire safety regulations in 2005. They only emerged after the Grenfell Tower public inquiry started its work. Burd is the first government official to give evidence to the inquiry, which is currently examining how successive administrations, from Labour onwards, liberalised building regulations. It is focusing on how combustible insulation foams and aluminium composite panels (ACM) filled with a plastic core that burns like petrol came to be allowed on Grenfell and thousands of other homes. It has already heard how Arconic, which made the combustible panels on Grenfell, targeted the UK market for sales of its most combustible polyethylene-filled panels because of less stringent requirements. Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Burd: “Do you accept that you, the British government, was aware from this time on, 2002, how ACM with a polyethylene [PE] core panel could behave in a fire?” Burd said “I would recognise, yes, that we had more insight in terms of this kind of performance.” The testing report compiled for Burd, at the time working in the office of the deputy prime minister, said the ACM panel performed so badly that the rig had to be extinguished early. Under a European classification of combustibility, the panels were likely to be ranked as D, which meant they should not be used on tall buildings. The safest class is A. “It’s a very fierce, fast fire,” said Burd. “This sort of product would not have been acceptable under the building regulations.” But under a separate UK system that measures only the spread of fire across the surface of a material, they were rated as class 0, which gave some users confidence that they could be used under building regulations, partly because guidance diagrams suggested that. Asked if the government considered making it clear after the tests that this kind of product should not be used above 18 metres, Burd said he understood that the building regulations guidance at the time did not allow this product. Asked whether anybody in the department considered alerting builders, local authorities, building control bodies or building owners to the “obvious dangers”, Burd said those bodies were part of an industry group consulted by government and there could have been discussion with building control representatives in that forum. “Was any consideration given by government – you in particular – about whether any specific intervention into the use of PE-core ACM above 18 metres was necessary?” Millett asked. “I can’t recall specifically,” Burd replied. The inquiry continues.",News/UK news,Fire safety official admits tests showed cladding danger 15 years before Grenfell ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/cladding-danger-evidence-15-years-before-grenfell-tower-fire
3/1/2022,"The shiny exterior of a new police headquarters in Dorset could pose a “lethal threat” to the local bird population. Concerns have been raised by Wool parish council over the potential for bird deaths as a result of the reflective surface of the proposed building in Winfrith, the Dorset Echo reported. The local authority said drawings of curtain walling on the building, which would provide a new headquarters for Dorset police, show the reflection of the sky, clouds and trees, raising fears that birds could be killed by inadvertently flying into it. In a letter to Dorset council, the local authority said: “It is well documented that reflective surfaces on buildings cause tens of thousands of bird deaths as the birds attempt to fly though the surface into the landscape they see in the reflection.” The council said colonies of house martins and swifts living in the local area, both migratory species on the red list for being in danger, could be at particular risk. It continued: “Birds from these breeding colonies utilise space over the Frome water meadows and other insect-rich areas such as the pasture and wet scrubland adjacent to the police HQ. “Both bird species would be vulnerable to lethal impact into reflective surfaces. It would appear that the vertical faces of this proposed building would have reflective surfaces, and without mitigation would pose a significant lethal threat to these birds.” The plans, which feature bronze aluminium windows and outer walls, are being weighed up by Dorset council. Although data on birds being injured or killed by flying into reflective surfaces in the UK is scarce, there have been several studies into the issue in the US. A peer-reviewed study, published in the science journal PLOS One, found birds flying into buildings to be “the largest source of avian collision mortality in North America”. Tom Hibbert, an ornithologist and content creator at the Wildlife Trusts, said: “For too long, the UK has built infrastructure at the expense of the natural world. It’s high time we put nature first. “That means ensuring all new developments help to benefit nature, providing habitats and avoiding designs that put wildlife at risk. “Shiny buildings and the reflections they create can be problematic for birds. There are things you can do to mitigate the risk, like using patterned glass and turning lights off at night.”",News/Environment,"Dorset police’s shiny HQ could pose ‘lethal threat’ to birds, says council",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/dorset-polices-shiny-hq-could-pose-lethal-threat-to-birds-says-council
3/1/2022,"A Ukrainian woman and her 15-year-old diabetic daughter say they are feeling increasingly distraught after escaping the conflict in Ukraine only to be blocked from a visa the UK government announced on Sunday evening for which they are eligible. Yakiv Voloshchuk, 60, a British citizen, rescued his wife, Oksana Voloshchuk, 41, and their daughter, Veronika, from Poland on 26 February. He drove from his home in London to the Polish border and waited for them to get across Ukraine’s border with Poland. He then did a return 24-hour journey by road across Europe before reaching Paris on Sunday where he hoped he would get the green light from British officials to bring his wife and daughter on the last leg of the journey to the UK. The family hoped it would be straightforward to reach the UK, especially after the publication of new Home Office guidance giving permission for some immediate family members of British citizens to apply free of charge to join their loved ones in the UK. But when Oksana and Veronika tried to apply for the new visa online they were blocked from proceeding unless they paid thousands of pounds, even though the application is supposed to be free. “We just don’t know what to do,” Yakiv Voloshchuk told the Guardian on Monday morning. “My wife’s bank account in Ukraine is frozen. We have booked into a hotel in Paris for a couple of days but I want to bring my family back to the UK to my home in London. We are getting very worried about my daughter because she is type 1 diabetic and is running out of insulin. We also don’t have a lot of money for food. She needs to eat regularly. “We went to Calais yesterday to try to cross to UK but we were refused permission and told to go to the visa centre in Paris. But when we tried to apply online the application says we need to pay £2,200 each and medical charges. The embassy is saying they can’t help. I am very worried about my daughter and I don’t understand why we have not been allowed to reach the UK.” Nataliya Rumyantseva who is also in Paris with her mother who crossed the border from Ukraine to Hungary and then flew to Paris in the hope of reaching the UK, is also struggling with the system. Unlike the Voloshchuks, her mother, Valentyna Klymova, does not qualify for the free visa under the new rules announced by the government on Sunday evening. Both families have been sent to various different places across Paris on Monday – from the UK’s visa processing centre, to the British embassy, then to the British consulate. They have now been told they need to go to another place where the UK visa team is located. All say they are completely exhausted from their journeys and are struggling with bureaucracy at a time when they are traumatised by war in Ukraine. “I’m feeling so helpless,” said Rumyantseva. “We know the source of all our problems is what Russia has done but dealing with all of this as well makes us feel like we are in a psychological pressure chamber.” A government spokesperson said: “This country has a proud history of providing protection to those who need it. We are working around the clock to process visa applications and are processing many applications in a matter of hours. “We are working with other European countries to ensure that responses to any migration issues are practical and in the best interests of the Ukrainian people.”",News/World news,Ukrainians denied entry to UK despite being eligible for visa ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ukrainians-denied-entry-to-uk-despite-being-eligible-for-visa
3/1/2022,"“She wasn’t a genius,” says one talking-head commentator early on in Lucy and Desi, Amy Poehler’s new bio-doc tribute to the illustrious creative partnership between the sitcom’s queen and king, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. That sounds like a swipe out of joint with the film’s overall attitude of soft-focus hagiography, but it’s meant as a testament to her indefatigable self-starter ethic. Ball’s success wasn’t effortless, we’re told, due to some innate talent she could activate as she pleased. Far from a God-given gift, her rubber-faced comedic chops were honed over years of teeth-cutting and stripe-earning on stage. Everything she had – the fame, the fortune, a seat at the head of the table in the largest independent studio in Hollywood – she got by working herself to the bone. It’s easy to see why Ball would be an aspirational figure for someone like Poehler, a fellow female comedian who triumphed over a male-dominated showbiz architecture by making a spectacular fool of herself on a weekly basis. Her assertive confidence behind the scenes, coupled with a bold un-self-seriousness at a time when the feminine ideal was that of the domestic goddess, made her a role model to a generation of cut-ups including Carol Burnett and Bette Midler. They both sit for Poehler’s camera to sing the praises of their idol, adding their voices to a chorus of adulation that drowns out everything else. The evident bounty of affection for Ball, however well-founded, doesn’t just leave Arnaz as a supporting character in this ostensible double portrait. It lends the whole production the syrupy taste of PR, like we’re watching a special-feature supplement on the home-video release of Being the Ricardos. (Surely not coincidentally, both titles are Amazon properties.) Those approaching the documentary as an opportunity to spend 100 minutes poring over rare archival footage of Ball and Arnaz will find their low bar amply met. Zippy montages of home movies or photographs paired with preserved audio, often whisked along by hooray-for-Hollywood hot jazz, walk us through the beats of the couple’s early years. She was a pathological entertainer who muscled her way through Vaudeville and B-movies; he was a Cuban refugee from the Batista regime (the politics of which are addressed so fleetingly that it only serves to create confusion) bringing the conga line to America as a high-energy bandleader in Miami. Theirs was a publicity romance turned real, and then transformed back into fiction once CBS offered to turn her radio show into a TV series and she demanded her real-life husband join her onscreen. I Love Lucy forever enshrined their union in the public imagination and made them the flawed, relatable antidote to the perfectly-pressed household ideal of Leave It to Beaver. But their success also began to drive a wedge between them that would end in divorce. He didn’t always enjoy being at the helm of the business while she, the funny one to his straight man, ascended to the highest tiers of stardom. Cranking out 41 episodes over 41 weeks left them with little time to spend together, a situation not helped by Arnaz’s womanizing, which the film restricts to a brief mention. Poehler instead focuses on the long-standing respect and the love that never extinguished ever after their split, allowing the acrimony to be present while relegating it to the background. As unimaginative a conclusion as it might be, watching Arnaz’s posthumous letter to his former wife recited at the Kennedy Center Honors nonetheless ends things on a tear-jerking note. More than any canniness in its arrangement, the film benefits from having a lot of watchable raw material to work with. Its most edifying insights pertain to how the couple’s production company Desilu revolutionized the way TV was made. Arnaz had the bright idea of adding a live studio audience to the multi-camera setup to capture the crackle of live performance, and essentially invented the next 50 years of small-screen comedy. Ball worked her real-life pregnancy into the scripts, a first in an era that preferred to leave such bodily matters undiscussed, and her resultant maternity leave led to Arnaz’s innovation of the rerun. One genuinely moving, inspired moment connects Ball’s expert character work to a compassion for humanity, suggesting that she learned fluency in shtick by taking an interest in strangers’ mannerisms everywhere she went. Yet their achievements along professional lines always lead back to the easily-agreed-upon assertion that Ball was a great performer and human being, and that she and Arnaz were each other’s lifelong muse. Though the clips of our old pals Lucy and Desi muster the pathos required to pull off these bids for sentimentality, as a work unto itself, the film is just the latest in a long line of pedestrian paint-by-numbers canonizations for Boomer-beloved icons of the 20th century’s latter half. For all the amazement at Ball’s tireless hustle and explosive originality, there’s a terminal lack of both in this monument to her memory.

3/1/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing demands from 37 Tory MPs that Britain must go further in welcoming Ukrainians fleeing war after a backlash against the government’s refugee policy. The prime minister has received a letter from members of the One Nation Conservatives group led by the former Home Office minister Damian Green calling for his government to “act decisively”and “share responsibility” with other European countries. “It is clear that this is not another migration crisis; this is a crisis of war. This should not be business as usual, we need sincere and immediate support for the Ukrainian people. The United Kingdom cannot flag or fail, our message must be clear: Ukrainian victims of war seeking refuge are welcome,” says the letter, seen by the Guardian. Under plans set out on Sunday evening, Ukrainian nationals settled in the UK will be able to bring their “immediate family members” to join them but these would be available only to spouses, unmarried partners of at least two years, parents or their children if one is under 18, or adult relatives who are also carers. The letter, which is also signed by the former ministers Jeremy Hunt, Caroline Nokes, and Sir Robert Buckland, points to claims made by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, that new measures would be implemented to help Ukrainians. The One Nation caucus, which is often seen as a centrist grouping in the party, has around 40 members. “The secretary of state for defence was clear this morning that the announcements about UK visas already made for Ukrainians were only ‘the first step’ in our package of support. He is right, this is only a first step and we must go further and act jointly with other European countries and share responsibility with them. We need to act now and we need to act decisively. “We urge the UK government to provide as much support as possible to our European partners who are currently the first safe havens for Ukrainian refugees – namely, Poland, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. We also hope our ministers will seek a flexible and pragmatic approach to those Ukrainians wishing to seek temporary refuge in the UK until it is safe to return to their lives in their home country.” The EU is preparing to grant Ukrainians who flee the war the right to stay and work in the 27-nation bloc for up to three years, senior officials said on Monday, adding that EU border states would get help to cope with the arrivals. At least 400,000 Ukrainian refugees had entered the EU so far, the EU home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, said. The EU members Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary have land borders with Ukraine. Designed to deal with mass arrivals of displaced persons in the EU, the proposals are expected to provide for the same level of protection, for one to three years, in all EU states, including residence permits and access to employment and social welfare.",News/UK news,Boris Johnson urged by Tory MPs to do more for Ukraine refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/boris-johnson-urged-by-tory-mps-to-do-more-for-ukraine-refugees
3/1/2022,"GlaxoSmithKline boss Emma Walmsley said she was “extremely confident” that it would complete the giant spin-off of its consumer healthcare unit in July, despite the market volatility caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The FTSE 100 company is demerging the unit, named Haleon last week, in what is expected to be the largest London listing for a decade and the biggest demerger in 20 years. GSK on Monday pledged to investors that the new company, which will run brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste, Panadol painkillers and Centrum vitamin supplements, would offer strong growth opportunities. The financial market turmoil caused by the invasion of Ukraine has already delayed the initial public offerings of some companies in Europe and the US. However, demergers are somewhat less dependent on market conditions as they do not usually involve the same need to persuade new investors to back them. GSK employs 400 people in Ukraine, and lists two businesses in Kyiv in its annual report, although it does not own any factories in the country. “We utterly condemn this invasion and the harm that it is causing the people of Ukraine,” Walmsley said. “We strongly support the actions being taken by the UK and other governments, including sanctions.” She added that the safety of employees was GSK’s priority, and that she had personally spoken to the country managers. The company was helping with efforts to relocate workers where possible, and is in talks with Direct Relief, a charity, about donations of medicines. The Haleon demerger has come with Walmsley under pressure from activist investors including Elliott Management and Bluebell Capital Partners, and after the rejection of a £50bn bid for the company from Unilever, another FTSE 100 consumer goods company. Walmsley said Haleon had “very compelling prospects”. Brian McNamara, chosen to lead Haleon when it is listed, said there was an “incredible opportunity in front of us”, pointing to the company’s large market share in countries such as Brazil, India and South Africa. Some analysts believe that consumers in those middle-income countries will spend more on healthcare products as they grow richer. “We believe the global focus on health and wellness is only set to increase,” he said. Haleon will aim to grow sales by between 4% and 6% over the next few years, with growth its priority followed by reducing the debt on its new balance sheet. McNamara said some of that growth would come through higher prices in recognition of increased costs during recent months. Haleon will also seek to grow by expanding its range of products, including by bringing out over-the-counter versions of treatments previously confined to prescriptions, and pushing further into “natural” supplements. The company will also seek to increase the proportion of products sold online from 8% of the business to the “mid-teens” by 2025, he said. GSK is in line to receive a £7bn dividend from the demerger, while minority owner Pfizer, the US drug company, will receive a £3bn dividend. Both will hold on to stakes in the new company.",News/Business,GSK boss upbeat over spin-off of consumer healthcare unit,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/gsk-boss-emma-walmsley-consumer-healthcare-unit-spin-off-haleon
3/1/2022,"Russia’s president summoned the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and military chief of staff, Valery Gerasimov, to a public meeting on Sunday and ordered them to “transfer the deterrence forces” – a reference to nuclear weapons – “of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty”. Although the diplomatic threat was clear enough, the exact phrasing confused nuclear experts and defence ministries, who did not recognise what a “special mode of combat duty” might specifically entail. But there was agreement that the threat, though it had gone up a notch, remained at a low level. Pavel Podvig, widely considered a leading expert on Russian nuclear forces, tweeted that that Putin’s order “most likely” meant “the nuclear command and control system received what is known as a preliminary command”. This would turn the system on, in effect, allowing “a launch order” to “go through if issued”. It would also allow, he wrote, for the nuclear weapons to be launched “if the president is taken out or can not be reached”, but he added, only in the case “it detects actual nuclear detonations on the Russian territory”. David Cullen, of the Nuclear Information Service, said this was, in a way, “analogous to the British system”, where the commanders of Trident nuclear submarines are given letters of last resort, signed by the prime minister, of instructions on how to act if it is believed that the UK has been destroyed by an all-out nuclear attack. Both Podvig and other experts, such as James Acton, a nuclear expert with the Carnegie Endowment, said Putin’s order could also entail further operational changes. That could include sending further nuclear armed submarines to sea or dispersing long range nuclear missiles around Russian territory, from where they could theoretically be used. But that may not necessarily be the case, Podvig added, given Putin’s phrasing was deliberately ambiguous. Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, said the UK did not recognise the terms Putin used. “That is not a term that is in their doctrine,” the minister told the BBC on Monday morning. The move was, he said, designed to scare the west and “remind the world he’s got a deterrent” and that it was a distraction designed to ensure that the west was “talking about it rather than the lack of success they are having in Ukraine”. The defence secretary also warned Russia could, in theory, use so-called tactical nuclear weapons in the fight against Ukraine. But this would amount to a massive – and still unlikely – escalation against what Putin has described as “one people” with Russians. “They could be every bit as powerful as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs; most people say there is no such thing as a non-strategic nuclear weapon,” said Sebastian Brixey-Williams, a co-director of the Basic thinktank. There was a signal, from the Kremlin itself, on Monday that its statement was primarily a form of high stakes diplomacy. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the decision came in response to various western warnings there could be “collisions and clashes between Nato and Russia”. He added: “I would not call the authors of these statements by name, although it was the British foreign minister.” Matthew Harries, a nuclear specialist with the Rusi thinktank, said the statements were a warning of a different sort. It was, in the first instance, simple intimidation – “we can hurt you, and fighting us is dangerous” – and a reminder to the west, which is increasingly arming the Ukrainians, not to go too far. “It could be Russia is planning a brutal escalation in Ukraine and this is a ‘keep out’ warning to the west,” he said.",News/World news,Would Vladimir Putin actually use nuclear weapons?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/russia-nuclear-weapons-putin-threat
3/1/2022,"Downing Street has publicly distanced itself from Liz Truss’s suggestion that Britons should be able to join the fight in Ukraine, saying this would contravene travel advice and people should instead consider making a donation instead. While not directly criticising the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson stressed that the Foreign Office currently advises against travel to Ukraine. It is understood that officials believe it would also be illegal for Britons to travel there with the intention of taking up arms. Separately, the spokesperson dismissed a claim by the Kremlin that comments from Truss – it was not made clear which – prompted Vladimir Putin’s decision to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. Asked about the comments, he said: “It remains the case that the rhetoric we are seeing from Putin’s regime is designed to distract from the situation on the ground.” On Sunday, Truss told the BBC she would “absolutely” back anyone wanting to volunteer to help the Ukrainians battle the Russian invasion, saying: “That is something people can make their own decisions about. The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe.” Asked about this, Johnson’s spokesperson said: “We think the best way to help Ukraine would be to ensure Putin fails. There are a number of ways that Brits can show their support . The Ukrainian embassy in London is putting up information about how British people can support them.” Pressed on whether this mean Truss had misspoken, he said: “We fully recognise the strength of feeling about British people wanting to support the Ukrainians following the Russian invasion. There is advice up on travelling to Ukraine. We currently advise against travelling to Ukraine, as you can see from the website.” Advice on the website of Truss’s department says those who travel to eastern Ukraine to “fight, or assist others engaged in the conflict” could be prosecuted on their return to the UK. Asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Truss’s comments, Wallace sought to argue she had been primarily trying to talk about Ukrainian nationals in the UK. He said: “I think what Liz Truss was quite rightly saying was that in her view this is a just cause, and that’s why the international community is united.” Truss’s comments prompted criticism from several MPs, including Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative backbencher who chairs the Commons defence committee. On Sunday, he tweeted: “Please do NOT go if you have no combat experience. You may get yourself and others who have to look after you, killed.” Questioned about Ellwood’s view, Wallace in effect endorsed it while trying to not directly criticise Truss. “I don’t think Liz Truss said we are supporting non-trained people to go and fight,” he said. “The advice here is, if you want to help Ukraine there are lots of ways of doing it. If you are a Ukrainian national here, or a dual national who wants to go and join your fellow countrymen, there is no bar on you doing that. “Tobias is right in this sense, as is any professional: if you’re going to be a fighter there, first of all please try and comply with the Foreign Office advice, because it is dangerous. But secondly, be trained, have experience, don’t be serving personnel. But fundamentally it is a dangerous situation, so if you are going to fight, be a professional, having had service.”",News/Politics, No 10 distances itself from Truss comments on UK volunteers for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/28/ben-wallace-distances-himself-from-truss-comments-on-uk-volunteers-for-ukraine
3/1/2022,"Until this week Daniel Mediakovskyi was a history student in the Ukrainian city of Lviv. Since Sunday, however, he has been sticking rubber bands and plastic tops on to homemade bombs. “It’s practical history. It’s time for this right now,” he explained, loading another molotov cocktail into a crate. Around him, about a dozen students and young creative professionals stood around a makeshift table. All wore masks and washing-up gloves. Each had a role in a busy production line. The basement bomb factory smelled strongly of petrol and paint remover – two molotov ingredients, along with polystyrene and silver dust. Mediakovskyi – who is 20 – said his mother had woken him early last Thursday to tell him Russia had invaded Ukraine. “I knew it was going to start. My hands started shaking,” he said. After spending a day doom-scrolling on social media, he decided he would try to help. “My parents know I’m volunteering. I haven’t told my granny. She’s worried enough about things already,” he admitted. He acknowledged that a molotov wouldn’t stop the mighty Russian army. But he stressed: “It will break Russian soldiers mentally, and show them they are not welcome here.” One of the molotovs fell off the table-top and smashed. The team cleared off for 10 minutes, allowing time for the noxious fumes to disperse. A ground-floor window had been propped open to improve ventilation. Outside, snow fell. Vladimir Putin’s campaign to seize and subjugate Ukraine has gone less well than the Kremlin might have hoped. Five days on, the Ukrainian army has fought back, blowing up Russian military convoys and deploying defensive weapons – some supplied by the US and UK – to devastating effect. Kyiv and other key cities have not fallen. At the same time, an army of civilian volunteers have been contributing to the war effort amid an unprecedented upsurge in patriotic feeling. They have donated food, offered accommodation to people forced to flee from bombardment, and have weaved camouflage military nets while singing songs. In Lviv, a former industrial complex used as a creative hub and rave space has been transformed into an improvised molotov factory. In one corner of the basement are stacks of bottles, some bearing stickers saying: “Apple juice, 1997”. In another, flowery linen squares, to be torn into strips and used as fuses. “We call them Bandera smoothies,” Lily Eleanor, a 25-year-old PR for fashion brands said, referring to the Ukrainian wartime nationalist leader Stepan Bandera. How did she cope with the pungent working conditions? “I love the smell. It’s the smell of freedom. The Russians don’t know what they are doing here,” she said. The volunteers – aged 18 to 35 – packed the finished molotovs into car boots, around 1,500 of them a day. They are then distributed via a trusted network of contacts, with some held in reserve in case Russia tries to seize Lviv. Tips on how to throw them at an invading enemy tank are swapped via Instagram and Facebook. Yuliia Oliinyk, 23, said she had little sympathy for Russian conscripts her age or younger sent to fight in Ukraine, some of whom have been captured. “I’m a student of international relations. It’s really good preparation for bomb-making,” she joked. Ukraine had tried hard to find a diplomatic solution to avoid war, she said. Olinnyk said that as well as making bombs she had taken classes in knife-fighting, grenade throwing and first aid. These skills were necessary because Ukraine had already spent eight years fighting Moscow and Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas. “Unfortunately, Russia is a part of our neighbourhood,” she said. In normal times the bomb-making factory is home to creative businesses: production studios, artists, and tattoo parlours. It now houses refugees on the fifth floor, camped out on mattresses next to arc lights and a print of Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup can artwork. On the ground floor is a cafe and drop-off point for clothes donations. Few of the young people making molotovs had ever thrown one. Bohdan Zhelobchuk, a user experience designer, said he had chucked a home-made bomb in 2014 in Kyiv, during the Maidan uprising against the country’s then pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych. “We made some cocktails back then. We started producing them again on Friday,” he said. According to the Kyiv Independent news site, one of Lviv’s breweries had shifted production from beer to bombs. “Pravda Brewery team is hand-bottling today. It’s a very special bottling. So many people willing to help. We’ll bottle beer later,” one of the brewery’s employees, Yuri Zastavny, posted on Facebook. Rodion Kadatskyi – a 25-year-old IT project manager from Mariupol – said not everybody was able to pick up a weapon and fight. Making bombs was another way of helping, he said. “The youth are moved by this patriotic spirit. Everyone now realises what he or she is capable of doing.”",News/World news,‘I haven’t told my granny’: Ukraine’s student molotov cocktail-makers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/i-havent-told-my-granny-ukraines-student-molotov-cocktail-makers
3/1/2022,"Russian rocket attacks have killed dozens of people in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian officials have said, in an apparent change of Russian tactics after a slower advance over four days of fighting than many expected. This photo shows the aftermath of a strike in Kharkiv: Pre-dawn blasts were again heard in the capital, Kyiv, and in the port city of Mariupol on the Sea of Azov in the south, officials said, but they added that attempts by Russian ground forces to capture major urban centres were still being repelled. Residents in Mariupol said it was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had taken control of the towns of Berdyansk and Enerhodar in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region, as well as the area around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. An attempted incursion in to Kharkiv was defeated, the Ukrainians said, a verdict largely confirmed by reporters on the ground. Attacks to the north-west of Kyiv were also repelled, though in Ukraine’s southern coastal regions the Russian military appeared to be gaining strength. In a sign that Russia was more actively targeting fixed infrastructure with missile attacks, an oil terminal was set ablaze in Vasylkiv, nearly 25 miles (40km) south-west of Kyiv. Satellite images showed a large, 3.25-mile long deployment of forces in a convoy north-east of Ivankiv, moving in the direction of Kyiv approximately 40 miles to the south. The convoy contains fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles. On Thursday Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv, including an ambitious attack by helicopters on the Hostomel military airbase. Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. A substantial attack was also aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. Social media footage showed them reaching Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles inside Ukraine. On Friday Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv, and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer. On Saturday Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Moscow claimed its forces had taken control of the Hostomel airfield. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces, including Sumy in the east. Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric also grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and armoured personnel carriers on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of around 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year: Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. This image from 18 February shows deployments including armour, helicopters and field hospitals in Novoozernoye: Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.

3/1/2022,"Cambridge University lecturers are accusing the institution of pressuring them into taking on “explosive workloads” to deliver its famous one-on-one tutorials. A survey of university teaching officers (UTOs) by the University and College Union branch found that a third (35%) felt they could not refuse requests from peers and superiors to take on extra weekly tutorials, or “supervisions” as they are known, even though nearly half of those surveyed said they would like to deliver fewer of them. Michael Abberton, the president of the UCU Cambridge branch, said: “The supervision system is not working for anyone in its current set up. It exploits casual workers, who need to earn an income and accumulate teaching experience. It overburdens permanent staff, who are already under the pressure of explosive workloads. “The university and the colleges cannot keep on denying that the system needs urgent reform, with improvements over pay, contracts and training for undergraduate supervisors.” A Cambridge University spokesperson said the system granted supervisors flexibility to choose which and how many colleges they work with and their hours, while training was provided for free and average pay is “well above the living wage”.He added that “since the colleges are separate legal and financial employers, they cannot be covered by a single agreement”. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of the UTOs surveyed by UCU said they delivered more than five hours of supervision a week, with preparation time averaging about 20 hours, on top of their full-time teaching schedules. Half said they worked more than 50 hours and 21% exceeded 60 hours a week, with some saying they were prevented from doing the research required to further their academic careers.One humanities UTO who spoke to the Guardian said she had been pressured by peers who warned the courses would not remain viable, and “to stay in the good graces of one’s senior colleagues”, especially given an “unstated expectation” that junior colleagues would supervise more, leaving her with only three weeks to spend on research.Fifty-six per cent of respondents also complained about low rates of pay, at £31 an hour of supervision, which does not cover preparation. The union estimates that in some cases this amounts to an hourly rate of around or below minimum wage. The survey builds on research from last year, which found that although Cambridge advertises supervisions to prospective students as a core feature of its world-leading teaching model, many of these are delivered on a “gig economy” basis. Nearly a third (28%) are delivered by teaching officers, who have a secure contract with the university, while almost half (45%) are delivered by precariously employed staff.This month, staff across UK campuses began 10 days of strike action over pay, pensions, insecure contracts and deteriorating working conditions. Supervisors also said the “byzantine” nature of the university’s structure – in which the central university arranges supervisions for some subjects and year groupings, and individual colleges for others – was partly to blame for the lack of transparency over differing rates of pay they received. “There’s nothing rational about Cambridge, it’s a product of history and changing government regulation and different forms of influence. There’s no way to understand except by being in the institution and having to navigate it,” said Graham Denyer Willis, a UTO who said “extreme amounts” of supervision had taken a toll on his career.",News/Education,Cambridge lecturers accuse university of ‘explosive workloads’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/28/cambridge-lecturers-accuse-university-workloads-staff-low-pay
3/1/2022,"I did a Jackanory Playhouse and got slightly drunk after the recording. I said: “It’s not real storytelling, is it? We’re reading off an Autocue.” The senior BBC figures said: “Well, what would you do?” My daughter was 10 at the time, tiny, feisty, but crap at football. I watched her charging around the playground yelling at the boys and thought: “If there really was a Robin Hood and he’d met my daughter, it wouldn’t have been him who was in charge of the gang.” My collaborator was the producer and director Dave Bell. Initially, we’d talked about me playing Robin Hood, because if an actor writes a series, why wouldn’t he give himself a big part? But I realised it would be more useful if I played the baddie, the Sheriff of Nottingham. Villains dictate the pace of a story and – having spent so many years as Baldrick in Blackadder, who’s a sweet, charming, braindead cutie – I wanted to play the polar opposite. I’d left school at 16 and had no education worth boasting about, so I was worried when I first began writing. People probably thought I had the same background as the rest of the Blackadder gang, who had all gone to public school, then spent three years being witty in Cambridge Footlights. But I hadn’t had that kind of life at all. So I asked Richard Curtis to give my writing the once-over. Luckily, he never saw our Little Brown Noses episode, which spoofed the showbusiness nature of Comic Relief, which he co-founded. They were very sweaty summers filming in Minehead, on the Somerset coast. Makeup designer Christine Powers created the black goatee the Sheriff wears. It was really itchy – getting a brush handle up the inside of it for a scratch between takes was an absolute joy. I always wanted the show to feature contemporary music, particularly because the Robin Hood legend lists one of the Merry Men as being a musician called Alan-a-Dale. Danny John-Jules, who played Rasta spiv Barrington, was a great dancer, but a terrible rapper. I’m glad the It’s Pancake Day rap became an earworm, though. Tens of thousands of people still join me in celebrating this ridiculous confection. About three years ago, I was invited to a convention with the rest of the Maid Marian cast. So many women in their 30s and 40s turned up with their kids – they’d been passionate fans. As a bloke in today’s climate, to be thanked for making a small contribution to the way women are portrayed on TV was just about the nicest thing that’s ever happened to me. I can’t lie: some mornings the set stank. You’d go down to shoot and find the mud had settled and the whole place was crawling with flies. Not nice when you’re all in pigskin shoes. Also, my underclothing was this particular shade of yellow that kept attracting ticks. I had to be checked between shots for bites. I loved where the script was coming from, though, empowering young women. It’s worth remembering that this was pre-Spice Girls. I’d done my thesis at college on the status of women in theatre, so I was driven by the idea of it. Adam Morris was cast as Robin of Kensington, a costume designer who people mistake for a heroic outlaw. I’d known Adam at drama school and the roles were a massive deal for both of us. At one point, Marian makes a speech in which she declares: “One day, pubs will be named after us, and we won’t have to pay unfair taxes.” That was the linchpin moment of the first series and it’s my favourite scene. I was incredibly nervous as we were filming it – there must have been 50 crew members watching from the clearing. Ramblers passing through Porlock Forest would sometimes wander on to the set. There’d be cries of: “Get a costume on them!” When I gave up acting to become a garden designer, there were a lot of articles about “the maid leaving Sherwood Forest to work among plants”. In some ways, though, it felt like a natural transition. My dad had been a gardener and I did it as a hobby when I wasn’t acting. Eventually, it felt right to go full-time. But Marian was great fun. I mean, what other job lets you go to the loo on a big hill overlooking the Devon coast, and then ask: “What are we doing today? Oh yeah, having a sword fight and jumping off trees attached to ropes.”  Maid Marian and Her Merry Men is streaming on BritBox.",Arts/Culture,‘I wanted to play the polar opposite of Baldrick’ – Tony Robinson on making Maid Marian and Her Merry Men ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/28/polar-opposite-baldrick-tony-robinson-on-making-maid-marian-and-her-merry-men-blackadder-robin-hood
3/1/2022,"Luciano Spalletti called it a “crossroads” in Napoli’s season. After their elimination from Europe on Thursday night, his team had no dreams left to pursue beyond a Scudetto bid that appeared to be fading. Top of the table at the start of December, the Partenopei had since fallen behind both Milan clubs and were starting to feel Juventus’s breath on their necks. Results were trending in the wrong direction. More importantly, so were performances. Napoli drew away to Barcelona at the Camp Nou but their 4-2 defeat in the return leg was more emphatic than the scoreline suggests. Spalletti’s team offered no answers to questions posed by Adama Traoré, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Frenkie de Jong. Three days earlier, Napoli had needed a late equaliser to draw 1-1 away to 17th-placed Cagliari. Their opponents created the better chances, and lamented a penalty not given when the ball struck Mario Rui’s hand inside the box. Optimism was in short supply ahead of Sunday’s trip to face a Lazio team with Champions League ambitions of their own. Spalletti, though, did not shy away from the moment. For the second week running, both Milan and Inter had drawn, giving his side the chance to go joint-top. “We need to choose whether we want to be quickly forgotten or to linger as heroes in the heads of Napoli’s supporters.” At first, it seemed as though Lazio might send them off down the former path. Ciro Immobile drew a save from David Ospina in the opening minute and Lazio would create two more good scoring chances inside the opening 10. Luis Alberto collapsed face-down into the turf after side-footing a shot wide at the back post. The Biancocelesti were carrying the weight of disappointment from their own European exit on Thursday, losing 4-3 on aggregate to Porto after some wasteful finishing in the second leg. Comments from the Lazio manager, Maurizio Sarri, made plain that he had not let go, either, of the 4-0 defeat they suffered to Napoli back in November. Anxiousness to avoid a repeat was understandable in the man who led the Partenopei to their highest-ever points total in 2017-18. He came with a better gameplan this time around, having Sergej Milinkovic-Savic drift right to accompany Felipe Anderson and flood one side of the pitch. Lorenzo Insigne was forced backwards to assist Napoli’s overwhelmed left-back, Mario Rui. Yet Lazio were unable to crown their superiority with a goal. Napoli, let off the hook, gradually found their way back into the game. Still, they struggled to create scoring opportunities of their own before Spalletti subbed off his team’s No 10, Piotr Zielinski, for Eljif Elmas just before the hour mark. The Poland international had been effectively smothered by Lazio, but his replacement brought a less subtle, more combative approach. It was Elmas who intercepted a pass from Patric to launch a Napoli attack moments after coming onto the pitch. The ball came back to him via Matteo Politano, and he nudged it through for Insigne to score from the edge of the box. No player in a Napoli shirt might have needed a goal more. Insigne was whistled by his own team’s supporters as he left the pitch against Barcelona, disappointment at the team’s performance mixing with resentment at the player’s decision to leave his boyhood club and join Toronto FC at the end of this campaign. Whether distracted by his impending move or simply out of form, this has not been Insigne’s finest season. He did score against Barcelona, his eighth goal in all competitions but also a seventh from the penalty spot. His only strike from open play had come in a 3-0 stroll past Legia Warsaw during the Europa League’s group stage. On Sunday he took his chance brilliantly, whipping a shot first-time around the lunging boot of Adam Marusic and into the bottom corner. Could this be a moment that restores him? Insigne put the ball in the net again seven minutes later but was denied by an offside ruling from the VAR booth. The game moved into a helter-skelter finale, Lazio pouring forward while Napoli sought a winner on the break. Pedro, on as a second-half substitute for the hosts, had already drawn one brilliant save from Ospina before he equalised with a spectacular first-time volley of a ball that had been headed clear from a free-kick. Napoli were back at the crossroads. Two minutes plus injury time remained. In the press box, match reports were hastily being reconstructed around familiar narratives of a team that is always said to crumble when the stakes are raised – coming up short just like they did on Thursday against Barcelona, just like they did under Sarri when they let the title slip through their fingers despite that record points haul. Not before or since Diego Maradona have Napoli seen a Scudetto challenge through to a triumphant conclusion. Perhaps they never will. But on Sunday, at least, they refused to yield, launching themselves straight back onto the attack. Victor Osimhen was denied by a brilliant block in the first minute of injury time. Nobody could stop Fabián Ruiz in the fourth. In a game of spectacular goals, this was a worthy winner. There were three defenders between the Spaniard and the goal when he received Lorenzo Insigne’s lay-off, so he swung the ball around them, sending it on a trajectory that seemed to be moving off target before nipping back in to kiss the inside of the post before nestling in the corner. Players spilled over the advertising hoardings in celebration with substitutes wearing training tops carrying the slogan “Sarò con te, e tu non devi mollare” – “I will be with you, and you must never give up”. It is a line from a terrace chant that Spalletti adopted in pre-season as a mantra for his players, a phrase to remind them who they are playing for. The juxtaposition of yellow bibs and blue tracksuits lent those words a different poignancy on Sunday, steering minds toward struggles more profound than football. Spalletti had spoken against the war in Ukraine at his pre-game press conference, saying: “No motive can be valid to force people to become refugees in the world, to risk being hit by bombs.” FridayMilan 1-1 UdineseGenoa 0-0 Internazionale SaturdayEmpoli 2-3 JuventusSalernitana 1-1 BolognaSassuolo 2-1 Fiorentina SundayLazio 1-2 NapoliSpezia 0-1 RomaTorino 1-2 CagliariVerona 3-1 Venezia To talk about resilience in a sporting performance feels trivial in a moment like this, yet Spalletti and his players were entitled to feel proud of sticking to their task and earning a result that puts them back on top of the Serie A table for the first time in almost three months. “I hear everyone busting our balls, saying that this team doesn’t have character,” said Spalletti. “Now I want to see what they say today. This team has character.” It has another big game coming up next weekend, too, against the Milan team with whom they now share first place. Napoli’s season remains at the crossroads.

3/1/2022,"Dozens of people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in rocket strikes by Russian forces on the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian interior ministry has said. Talks between Ukraine and Russia got under way on the border with Belarus on Monday morning. Ukraine had agreed to talks with Russia “without preconditions”, the office of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. British intelligence appears to corroborate a recent report from Ukraine’s military that Russia had “slowed down” its offensive. Britain’s defence ministry has said Russia’s advance on Kyiv has been slowed by logistical failures and fierce Ukrainian resistance. The Russian central bank has increased interest rates to 20% from 9.5% after the rouble plunged up to 40% on Monday after western sanctions. The EU is expecting Ukraine’s application to join the European Union “imminently” and officials in Brussels said “this will need to be assessed very rapidly by the council and the decision made as to whether to request an urgent opinion from the European Commission”. Residents in Mariupol said the port city on the Sea of Azov was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack on Monday morning. Amnesty International has condemned Russia’s reported use of cluster munitions in Ukraine, saying an attack on a pre-school “may constitute a war crime”. Russian invasion forces seized two small cities in south-eastern Ukraine and the area around a nuclear power plant, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday, but ran into stiff resistance elsewhere as Moscow’s diplomatic and economic isolation deepened. The UK government announced a slew of measures “to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the Russian central bank, the Russian national wealth fund, and the country’s ministry of finance”. The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it would send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House. An update from Ukraine’s interior ministry late on Sunday night said 352 Ukrainian civilians had so far been killed during Russia’s invasion, including 14 children. The ministry said a further 1,684 people, including 116 children, had been wounded. Blasts were heard in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Meanwhile, about 90 miles (150km) north-east of Kyiv in Chernihiv, a missile reportedly hit a residential building in the centre of the city, causing a fire to break out, the agency added. About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday. Forty Ukrainian civil society groups have come together to call on the west to establish safe zones for refugees inside Ukraine, and provide technology to help document Russian war crimes as part of a plan to make Vladimir Putin and his inner circle face justice at the international criminal court.",News/World news,Ukraine: what we know on day five of Russia’s invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/ukraine-what-we-know-on-day-five-of-russias-invasion
3/1/2022,"A Ukrainian sailor has been arrested in Mallorca and faces charges of attempting to sink a yacht owned by Alexander Mikheev, the CEO of the Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport and former head of the Russian helicopter federation. The boat is moored in the harbour of Port Adriano. The unnamed man, who has been employed for the past 10 years as a mechanic on the Lady Anastasia, Mikheev’s 48-metre, £5m yacht, said he felt he had to do something after seeing footage of a Russian rocket attack on a block of flats in Kyiv, his home town. The defendant told the judge that he believed the rocket had been manufactured by Mikheev’s company. Once on board the vessel he told the crew members, most of whom are also Ukrainians, to abandon ship. He allegedly then went to the engine room and opened a large valve in an attempt to sink the yacht. The crew members, aided by port staff, intervened to prevent the sinking. “The owner of this yacht is a criminal who makes his living selling arms that are now being used to kill Ukrainians,” he told police when he was arrested.

3/1/2022,"This ambitious French sci-fi parable has some quiet moments of beauty and poignancy, but otherwise it’s a long slog – and so bombastic, jejune and ill-considered that it feels far more drawn out than the 87 minutes running time would suggest. In writer-director Romain Quirot’s vision of the future, humanity has worked out how to mine an inexhaustible power supply from an astral object that happens to wander by; it is called, unimaginatively, “the red moon”. This heavenly body appears to be like the living, sentient planet in Stanislaw Lem’s novel Solaris (a book adapted twice, by Andrei Tarkovsky and Steven Soderbergh), and our hero Paul WR (Hugo Becker) can somehow sense that the red moon is quite cross with us earthlings for some reason. That would appear to be why he refuses to fly a mission to destroy the approaching lunar body, even though, in a frankly silly plot move, he is the only person in the world that can possibly do it. Likewise, the script is vague about whether the Earth has become one huge desert that resembles Morocco because of the red moon or just due to the climate meltdown we’re already experiencing. First-time director Quirot is clearly more interested in making points about the dysfunctional family dynamics Paul grew up with: a mum who died when he was young, a distracted science genius dad (Jean Reno, wasted here). There’s also an older brother named Eliott (Paul Hamy) who uses his psychic powers to persuade people to kill themselves. Instead of the big mission, Paul goes on the run to search for a mysterious forest for no very clear reason. He teams up with a pretty, gamine young woman (Lya Oussadit-Lessert) who he meets at a rest stop where he tries to get a new battery for his electric hover car. These cars, you see, are supposed to float above the ground thanks to the mysterious energy source harvested from the red moon. They look good in the VFX long shots but Quirot never explains why they rock around when they’re driving, just like any old banger with four wheels would. The inattention to detail is what makes this feel like a triumph of style over content, and not in a good way.

3/1/2022,"In 2017, I went to Moscow to see the empire of Russian billionaire Arkadiy Novikov. There was a new restaurant on every corner – smelling of garlic but also paint, the air thick with money – and Novikov seemed to own all of them. It wasn’t possible, in the end, to figure out what kind of restaurateur he was, a good one or a bad one, because he just owned so many, spanning such an impossible range of cuisines, that it became a numbers game. Some of them couldn’t help but be good; others could help it. Novikov told me about the abject poverty of his childhood, sharing one tomato with his mother and grandmother, making a cucumber last a week; and his apprenticeship, cooking soup for the dogs in the Russian army. There were bits missing from his origin story, specifically, how Russia after perestroika (the 1980s reformation movement) delivered him not a part of the restaurant scene but the majority of it, but for some reason I chose to focus my questions on how you make a soup for a dog. “Pearl barley,” he said. “The head of a pig; a few potatoes.” His culinary sensibility was marked by a hyper-masculine obsession with size, steaks as big as the plates they sat on, from Miratorg, a million-hectare (2.5m-acre) ranch. I took it as part of the pantomime; strongman politics were to Moscow what kombucha was to New York. Looking back I realise what he was actually describing, quite carefully, was the agricultural element of a steadily building fortress economy. The EU sanctions against Russia, launched in 2014 in response to its annexation of Crimea, never included food. Instead, they were concentrated on cutting off access to capital markets, and blocking the import of tech that could be used for arms, fracking or oil exploration. Putin’s retaliatory move was to ban fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and dairy from the EU and the US, as well as Canada, Australia and Norway. By 2017, that Miratorg ranch was supplying one-fifth of all the meat in Russia. Novikov, meanwhile, was trying to make sure the international tensions didn’t inconvenience the discerning palate, by recreating European charcuterie and cheeses. He had French and Swiss chefs holed up in cavernous factories that shone like laboratories, making chorizo, mozzarella, feta and brie, with a restaurant attached serving only cheese. Sometimes with a pizza or a salad underneath it, but basically cheese. I didn’t give a huge amount of thought to the politics behind it, since it was a very elite market, and didn’t seem to touch the lives of the ordinary citizen. Wages and living standards were falling – this stuff was all terrifically expensive, it seemed like a frippery. I did, however, think a lot about the cheese, which made no sense. They had money, time, expertise, raw materials, and yet they couldn’t get a mozzarella to taste like mozzarella; instead, they had these hard little balls of solid texture, with nothing like that unique journey, from stringy exterior to squidgy middle. The feta tasted more like Georgian cheese than anything Greek (Georgian cheese is wonderful, actually, but it’s not the same). The “brie” resembled brie only in so far as it was round. I was too polite to ask how on earth it had all gone so wrong, and arrived privately at two broad conclusions: first, that centuries of knowledge are embedded in something greater than a single cheesemaker, and no one alone can recreate them; second, that Russian cows must be wired different. They were the wrong broad conclusions – this was a statement of intent. It didn’t matter what the cheese tasted like to me; what mattered was the long game, which was not to wait for international reconciliation, but to forge on in glorious isolation, plugging the lifestyle gaps with play-dough, if needs be. One of the many difficult lessons of the 21st century is that you should always pay attention to how rich people are spending their money, even if it looks like nothing. If they’re eating bad cheese, never stop asking why.

3/1/2022,"Russia’s central bank has more than doubled interest rates to 20% and refused to open the Moscow stock exchange in an attempt to protect its currency and economy in the face of international sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine. The rate rise, from 9.5%, is aimed to balance the precipitous fall in value of the rouble and surging inflation as the country braces for its financial markets to take a battering this week. Russia’s central bank said Moscow’s stock exchange would stay closed all day on Monday, after initially delaying trading until at least 3pm local time. The rouble fell 30% to a record low against the dollar before the intervention, and was down 25% after the move by the central bank. “External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,” the central bank said in a statement, adding that the rate increase “will ensure a rise in deposit rates to levels needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risk”. The central bank has ordered companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues. Elvira Nabiullina, the governor of Russia’s central bank, was due to speak on Monday afternoon detailing further measures. The central bank said the measures would “depend on the evaluation of risks from external and internal factors and financial markets’ reaction to them”. Other steps announced over the weekend include an assurance from the central bank that it would resume buying gold on the domestic market. Neil Shearing, the group chief economist at Capital Economics, said: “The central bank of Russia has this morning raised interest rates to 20% but other measures (eg limits on deposit withdrawals) are possible later today. All of this will accelerate Russia’s economic downturn – a fall in GDP of 5% now looks likely. Subsidiaries of some Russian banks overseas are likely to come under intense pressure (and may fail), but we judge that these are probably too small to create systemic risks.” Over the weekend, Vladimir Putin put his nuclear forces on high alert, while on Monday the commander of the Ukrainian forces said Russian troops had been stopped from taking over the capital, Kyiv.",News/Business,Russia’s central bank doubles interest rates and closes stock market as rouble plunges,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/russia-central-bank-rates-rouble-sanctions-economy-ukraine
3/1/2022,"In 2019 Tamara Stefanovich treated London to a thrilling survey of the piano étude in the last century, from Scriabin to the present day, which was one of the highlights of the musical year in the capital. Now she has turned her attention to sonatas, and devised a three-part recital – over two and a half hours of music, taking in 20 works – that mixes the baroque and the modern, and carefully avoids what many would see as the heyday of the piano sonata, from Haydn and Mozart to Brahms and Liszt. As well as sonatas by the Bachs, Johann Sebastian and his son Carl Philipp Emanuel, in the first part of Stefanovich’s programme, one-movement sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti and his Catalan successor Antonio Soler provided baroque interludes in each section, each of which was played as a seamless sequence. The ending of one sonata was sometimes elided with the opening of the next so that, for instance, the low G that ends Scarlatti’s Sonata Kk13 became the launchpad for the freewheeling fantasia that opens CPE Bach’s G minor Sonata, while the quiet ending of Soler’s D flat Sonata R110 ushered in the surprisingly pastoral (almost Vaughan Williams-like!) opening of Hindemith’s Third Sonata. It all seemed a little breathless at times, but Stefanovich generally opted for more reflective Scarlatti and Soler sonatas, aware no doubt that her 20th-century choices rarely offered much repose, whether in her typically fearless performance of Bartók’s hyperactive sonata, her brittle, extrovert one of Hanns Eisler’s Schoenbergian First Sonata, his official Op 1, or her slyly malevolent take on Scriabin’s Ninth Sonata, with its incessant trills and curling wisps of melody. The Second Sonata by Nikolai Roslavets, took over where the Scriabin left off, though as Stefanovich pointed out from the platform, it was more important in the context of the present time that he was a Ukrainian. And finally there was Galina Ustvolskaya’s Sixth Sonata, a thunderous barrage of clusters played with fists and forearms, interspersed with forlorn fragments of melody; an extraordinary end to a remarkable feat of sustained pianism.",Arts/Music,Tamara Stefanovich: 20 Sonatas review – a remarkable feat of sustained pianism,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/28/tamara-stefanovich-20-sonatas-review-queen-elizabeth-hall
3/1/2022,"Arwen, Barra, Malik, Corrie, Dudley, Eunice, Franklin. The storms that have hit the UK since late November 2021 have caused huge disruption. We are just two months into 2022, and before the end of the year we may have to endure one or more storms Gladys, Herman, Imani and Jack, the next few names on the Met Office list. This season is by no means unique. In the winter of 2019-2020, storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge cost the insurance and reinsurance industries nearly £800m, largely as a result of disastrous flooding. During the past decade, winter storms and floods, as well as heat and drought, seem to have become the new normal. Back in 2012, for instance, there was a winter drought, followed by the wettest early June for 150 years and widespread flooding and wind damage in the autumn. Are these recent extremes of weather a temporary blip or are they part of a long-term pattern – and if so are we doing enough to make us more resilient for future weather? The answer to these two questions is “almost certainly yes” and “certainly not”. The “almost certainly yes” comes from climate modelling. Although climate scientists are pushing the limits of their models when they try to attribute individual weather events to global heating, there is general agreement that extreme weather is likely to become more common as the air warms. Put simply, this is because warmer air holds more energy and more moisture: two key ingredients of severe storms. But the extremes in the UK weather will not only include storms and floods, but also heatwaves and periods of drought. Last June, British Columbia suffered a heatwave with record-breaking temperatures of up to 49.6C, followed by catastrophic floods in November that cut all transport routes into Vancouver from the east. The UK will also be more likely to experience extremes like these in the future. A few years ago, the American environmentalist Hunter Lovins coined the term “global weirding” to capture the fact that climate change is not just about the world getting warmer, but also getting more extreme. The “certainly not” comes from the UK’s statutory advisory body, the Adaptation Committee (AC), the sister committee to the Climate Change Committee (CCC). The AC advises and reports to parliament on how the country can build resilience and future-proof us against the likely impacts of climate change. In a recent report, based on the work of more than 450 experts and including more than 1,500 pages of evidence and analysis, the conclusions are stark. Adaptation action has failed to keep pace with the worsening reality of climate risk, and therefore the gap between risk and preparedness has increased. The UK has the capacity and the resources to adapt but the government is simply not doing enough. The report also concludes that acting now will be cheaper than waiting to deal with the consequences. So what action do we need? The AC’s advice highlights eight top risks that the government should start to tackle in the next two years. These include risks to the electricity supply, to soils, food production and trees and to supply chains, as well as risks of overheating in buildings. As well as preparing for these risks, the government needs to set out its vision for what a well-adapted and resilient UK would look like, and a clear route map for the future. So far it has failed to do this. This vision should integrate adaptation into all aspects of policy. For instance, we are still building hundreds of thousands of homes that will not be fit for living in within a few decades, either because they are in places that will flood, or because they are not designed to cope with “heatwave” summers that will be the norm by 2050. Adaptation should be integral to “levelling up”, because the impacts of climate change will increase inequalities. Poorer households are more severely affected by the health and financial consequences of flooding and other extremes. The government has accepted the facts and conclusions, but acting on them is hard. It involves many different government departments, each with its own particular priorities, which may be at odds with taking a broader view. In addition, adaptation requires upfront investment now for longer-term gain. For instance, investment now in water efficiency and heatwave planning has, according to the AC’s climate risk report, an estimated benefit of more than £10 for each £1 spent, but the benefit comes in the future and the cost comes today. Lack of action now is storing up problems and costs for future generations: they will have to pay for our negligence.

3/1/2022,"This was meant to be the second-tier season to beat them all in Germany, and not just in a domestic context. Schalke and Werder Bremen filling the relegation places in May 2021 meant they joined Hamburg, Hannover, Fortuna Düsseldorf and Nürnberg in Bundesliga 2, before we even get to names such as St Pauli and Dynamo Dresden. This weekend, Werder won a five-goal thriller at Hamburg in the Nordderby to stay top of the table. After a turbulent season which has included the departure of coach Markus Anfang after a federal investigation into him faking a vaccination certificate (for which he was eventually fined and banned by the DFB), Werder won’t be counting any chickens just yet. Whether they return to the top tier or not, it seems as if next season’s Bundesliga 2 will be even more laden with big names than the present one. We are in for a layered and intense relegation battle, with all of the bottom six in the mix and some big names in serious trouble. The most desperate battle of the weekend was between direct competitors, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Wolfsburg, two clubs for whom the drop would be potentially ruinous. The contest swayed one way and then the other, like a drunk feeling for the edge of the bar for support. Gladbach flirted with costly failure, going 2-0 down in just over half an hour and then, after a vastly improved second-half showing, thought they had a winner when Matthias Ginter smashed the ball home in front of the Nord Kurve before referee Tobias Reichel and team cut the celebrations short, with Patrick Hermann penalised for an earlier foul on Jérôme Roussillon. There were reasons for optimism all round with the way it ended – Florian Kohfeldt, buoyed by his team holding on after Maxence Lacroix’s red card, spoke of “a deserved, important point”, while Gladbach fed off coming from behind and from Marcus Thuram’s first goal of a hitherto very difficult season. Yet for all the what-could-have-beens, both sides knew a point doesn’t give them more than a smidgeon of breathing space – and that they were both, at various points, close to a damaging defeat. FridayHoffenheim 2-1 Stuttgart SaturdayBayer Leverkusen 3-0 Arminia BielefeldBorussia M'gladbach 2-2 WolfsburgEintracht Frankfurt 0-1 Bayern MunichFreiburg 3-0 Hertha BerlinGreuther Furth 1-1 1 CologneUnion Berlin 3-1 Mainz SundayAugsburg 1-1 Borussia DortmundVfL Bochum 0-1 RB Leipzig They also know that they are lucky to not be Hertha, who were beaten soundly at Freiburg, a less well-resourced reminder of what can be done with stability and competent planning. For the second successive week coach Tayfun Korkut talked of the result “not reflecting the game”, following the 6-1 home beating by Leipzig. After the late goal by Augsburg’s Noah Sarenren Bazee earned his team a point against Borussia Dortmund on Sunday, the Berliners are in the relegation playoff place. One of the few bright spots was the performance of 20-year-old debutant goalkeeper Marcel Lotka, with Korkut “very happy” with his performance – but Kicker reported on Monday that the Poland under-21 international is set to join Borussia Dortmund on the expiration of his contract this summer. Despite Hertha being yet to win in 2022, Korkut appears to be safe until the end of the season at least, with head of sport Fredi Bobic backing him and turning focus on to the players who have “great contracts”, as he told Sport 1’s Doppelpass on Sunday. “Now,” continued Bobic, “they have to be held accountable.” Even worse off are Stuttgart, whose heartbreaking late loss at Hoffenheim on Friday night – after a Wataru Endo opener they led until the 85th minute, upon which they conceded twice to Christoph Baumgartner – made it nine games without a win and left them in increasing danger of what would be a third relegation in seven years. Like his counterpart Korkut, Pellegrino Matarazzo defended his players. “We played well, were 1-0 up and went home empty-handed,” said Materazzo. “This is extremely difficult to take.” Christoph Baumgartner scored two late goals to complete @TSGHoffenheimEN's comeback win against VfB Stuttgart.#TSGVFB pic.twitter.com/e8rmabOjye While Hertha can’t complain of a lack of resources, Stuttgart have had to deal with a series of personnel issues, adding to their longstanding boardroom wranglings. Gregor Kobel and Nicolás González left for combined fees of over €40m in the summer, and a young team has been further decimated by injuries to key players. Silas Katompa Mvumpa didn’t return from an ACL injury until November and having showed flashes of his old form recently, he badly dislocated his shoulder against Bochum last week – following surgery, he will miss the rest of the season. Having scored 16 times last season, frequent injury niggles have limited man-mountain striker Sasa Kalajdzic to just four Bundesliga starts. His flick for Endo’s goal underlined what an important attacking conduit he is. Materazzo and company face Gladbach next in Saturday’s Top-Spiel. “It’s time we rewarded ourselves,” said the coach defiantly but, with only 10 games left, it feels like next season’s second tier will be even more of a battle royale than this edition, come what may in both divisions’ closing weeks.  The fallout continues in Dortmund after the embarrassing Europa League elimination to Rangers, with spirits hardly lifted by the concession of that equaliser at Augsburg on Sunday after Thorgan Hazard’s stylish opener – meaning the gap with Bayern Munich at the top widened to eight points. It was less the result in Bavaria – “the lads got the most out of what was in the tank today, said Marco Rose, with some justification after Thursday night’s exertions in Glasgow – but the sense of deja vu that nagged, with little left to play for and already the sense that sporting director-to-be Sebastian Kehl has a big job on his hands, which might include showing the door to his former teammates and club totems Marco Reus and Mats Hummels if a report in Saturday’s Bild is to be believed. It ended #Bundesliga honours even in #FCABVB, as Noah Sarenren Bazee cancelled out @HazardThorgan8's opener... pic.twitter.com/4JBXbiYCfd  Bayern won by a single Leroy Sané goal at Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday evening, in which they were improved – if still imperfect – defensively, but the question of the future hangs over the champions too, with Robert Lewandowski, Manuel Neuer and Thomas Müller having contract issues to be addressed. Sporting director Hasan Salihamdzic told Sky that losing Lewandowski was “out of the question”, though the Poland striker (who wore an armband in the colours of Ukraine’s flag on the day his country said they would refuse to play Russia in the World Cup qualifying play-off) later replied it was “the first I’ve heard of it”.  As well as Lewandowski’s armband, there were a series of other gestures in support of Ukraine across the Bundesliga weekend starting at Hoffenheim on Friday night, while Schalke announced on Monday morning that they would “end the club’s partnership with Gazprom prematurely”, having already removed the Russian state-owned energy company’s name from the shirts before the weekend draw at Karlsruhe. Meanwhile Köln’s board and a group of supporters spent Monday’s day of Karneval at a peace demonstration in the city’s Chlodwigplatz.  Leipzig are still in the fourth Champions League place thanks to Christopher Nkunku’s clinically taken late winner at Bochum – a game in which the home side caused a series of problems for Domenico Tedesco’s team – and with wins for Freiburg and Hoffenheim too, positions four, five and six are all on 40 points, with Union Berlin just three behind after a 3-1 win over Mainz, ending their dodgy post-Max Kruse run and garlanded by Sheraldo Becker’s curling beauty from range.",Sport/Football,Bundesliga set for a relegation battle royale between some of its biggest clubs | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/28/bundesliga-set-for-a-relegation-battle-royale-between-some-of-its-biggest-clubs

In this instance, hot chillies, fresh lime, fish sauce and sugar create a flavour combination that is hard to match. I love it on any type of salad, but douse it over a pan-fried pork chop and it really does transport you to a sizzling street food stand in Hanoi.

Using a sharp knife, finely slice the radishes and roughly chop the coriander, add to the bowl and toss to combine. Put a griddle pan on a high heat and, once it’s smoking hot, brush with a little oil, lay in the chops and grill, turning frequently to prevent burning and basting with any leftover marinade, for five to seven minutes (I like my pork so that it’s very slightly pink and still juicy, but cook to your liking). Leave the meat to rest for five to 10 minutes, then slice finely. Dress the salad with half the nuoc cham dressing, then top with the pork. Serve with sticky rice and the rest of the nuoc cham for spooning over. For a vegetarian take, substitute the fish sauce for soy, and fry some celeriac steaks instead of the pork chops.

3/1/2022,"The Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert was condemned for comparing the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the clearing of a truckers’ protest in Ottawa, saying: “We also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and who need to be liberated.” A former US ambassador to Canada called the comments “reckless” and “dangerous”. A protest in imitation of the Canadian truckers has been making its away across the US. It is expected in Washington this week. Anthony Housefather, a Liberal member of the Canadian parliament, told Boebert that “while it’s good that you are not following the Trump line and are standing with Ukraine instead of Putin, it is sad to hear you compare free and democratic Canada to the invasion of Ukraine. “If you would like to learn about Canada please reach out.” That seems unlikely. Boebert, from Colorado, is a far-right controversialist and conspiracy theorist who since being elected in 2018 has consistently sought attention through confrontation. She was discussing the Ukraine invasion at CPAC, the conservative event in Florida, in an interview with Fox Nation hosts Pete Hegseth and Kayleigh McEnany, the latter a former White House press secretary under Donald Trump. Trump has condemned the invasion but repeatedly praised Putin. Boebert said: “I pray for Ukraine and I wish them the best.” She also praised the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose response to an evacuation offer was widely reported. “They have a great president right now who really said, clearly, ‘Live free or die’,” Boebert said, reaching for the New Hampshire state motto before paraphrasing Zelenskiy, saying: “I don’t need a ride, give me ammunition. The fight is right here.” She continued, saying: “But we also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and you need to be liberated and we need that right here at home.” It was a reference to the “Freedom Convoy”, a truckers’ protest which choked downtown Ottawa this month. The protest began against vaccine mandates but morphed into a protest against the government of Justin Trudeau. The prime minister used emergency powers to aid the effort to end the protest, which saw police and protesters clash in the snowy streets of the Canadian capital. Many in Canada and the US reacted to Boebert’s comments with anger. Bruce Heyman, who was US ambassador to Canada under Barack Obama, said the congresswoman’s remarks were “reckless, dangerous and [crossed] every line of diplomacy and decency.

3/1/2022,"The Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, is reportedly mediating over the Russian invasion of Ukraine, although his spokesperson has acknowledged he would have “limited” influence. The move comes amid pressure from campaigners and MPs for Abramovich to be targeted by western sanctions. He made his first public comment since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, via his Chelsea spokesperson, to claim his help had been requested. “I can confirm that Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,” his spokesperson said. “Considering what is at stake, we would ask for your understanding as to why we have not commented on neither the situation as such nor his involvement.” The request for his intervention came from the Ukrainian film producer Alexander Rodnyansky. No further details about his role, if any, have been given. Abramovich has passed the stewardship of Chelsea to the trustees of the club’s charitable foundation, although he remains the owner. Provided he is not sanctioned, he can continue to fund the club. He has disputed reports of his alleged close relationship with Vladimir Putin and denied there is any merit to sanctions being imposed against him. Last week the Labour MP Chris Bryant used parliamentary privilege to say that Abramovich was identified by the Home Office in 2019 as having links to the Russian state as well as to “corrupt activity and practices”. Quoting from a leaked Home Office document, Bryant said the UK should seize Abramovich’s assets and bar him from owning Chelsea. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has claimed the UK has a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs who will face sanctions over the coming weeks, and said there would be “a rolling programme of sanctions” once the cases against individuals were legally watertight. “We are targeting oligarchs’ private jets, we’ll be targeting their properties, we’ll be targeting other possessions that they have,” she told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “There will be nowhere to hide.” Truss also said the government would be bringing forward its long-awaited economic crime bill this week to make it easier for assets to be targeted, by enforcing more transparency about ownership. So far only eight Russian oligarchs have been identified as being subject to individual UK sanctions but officials are understood to be examining more than 100 individuals as potential targets, with more names expected to be released in the coming days.

3/1/2022,"UK petrol and diesel prices have passed the “grim milestone” of 150p a litre for the first time, with further rises expected as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushes up the cost of fuel worldwide. The average price of unleaded petrol climbed to 151.25p and diesel rose to 154.74p on Sunday, both record highs, according to RAC data from roughly 7,500 UK petrol forecourts. The jump in fuel prices will add to the burden on the UK public who are already struggling with a cost of living crisis, with inflation at 5.5% in January – its highest rate for almost 30 years. “It’s truly a grim milestone that no one ever wanted to see,” Simon Williams, the RAC’s fuel spokesperson, said. “This is really going to hurt household budgets.” Williams warned that fuel costs were likely to increase and could even sail above 160p a litre in the coming weeks – worsening the impact on British living costs. He said this would make the cost of a full tank of petrol for a 55-litre family car £83 and diesel £85. Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokeperson, said: “Petrol at [above] 150p a litre reaches a milestone that millions of motorists faced with a cost of living crisis have dreaded. It comes as households are getting notices of domestic energy price rises in April. To think that less than two years ago fuel at £1 a litre beckoned.” The latest figures are a jump from petrol’s 149.67p and diesel’s 153.05p on Thursday, both record highs at the time. “Despite the wholesale market calming slightly at the end of last week as oil fell back under $100, prices at the pump will continue to go up as retailers buy in new stock at much higher prices,” Williams added. Russia is the world’s second-largest crude oil exporter behind Saudi Arabia and there are fears Vladimir Putin could respond to western sanctions by restricting supplies. “We must now wean ourselves off dependence on Putin’s oil and gas,” Boris Johnson told the Munich security conference last weekend. However, the prime minister said it would be “the work of the months and years to come”. Johnson imposed a package of sanctions on Russia last week – following Germany’s cancellation of the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline – and Putin has begun responding. Conservative MP Robert Halfon said fuel was now “genuinely going to be unaffordable for most families”, adding: “It isn’t just for motorists, it’s businesses too because they can’t afford transportation costs and this has a huge knock-on impact in terms of prices.” Halfon urged the government to take action by cutting VAT or fuel duty, arguing it would be relatively affordable “because they are raking it in at the moment given the prices of petrol”. BP on Sunday announced it was exiting its £10.4bn stake in Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft, citing a “fundamental change” in relations with Moscow and responding to pressure from the UK government. Prices for Brent crude oil – the international benchmark – surged 4.8% to $102.67 a barrel on Monday.

The region has set aside a total €10m for the initiative, and applications for the refund can be made up until the end of January 2023, or until the fund runs out. “The scheme is needed to support a sector that has suffered badly from the economic crisis,” said Nicola Zingaretti, the president of Lazio. “We have put the significant investment in place also with an eye on the tourism sector, and with the awareness and pride of being able to boast about every part of our region, with many locations among the most magical and fascinating in the world thanks to an unparalleled cultural heritage.” Since the start of the pandemic, 9,000 couples have wed in Lazio, compared with more than 15,000 in 2019. The Lazio region has a rich variety of locations to choose from, including the Italian capital, a host of mediaeval hilltop towns and the sand dune beaches that line Circeo national park. Among the most famous weddings to have been held in the region was that between the now divorced Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, who married in Orsini-Odescalchi castle in Bracciano in 2006. “Let’s relaunch a sector that has been on hold for a long time – the whole wedding chain has suffered economically during the last two years,” said Valentina Corrado, Lazio’s tourism councillor.",News/World news,"‘Lazio in love’: Italian region offers couples €2,000 wedding payment",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/italys-lazio-region-offers-couples-money-weddings
