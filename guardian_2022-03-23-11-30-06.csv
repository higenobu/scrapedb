3/23/2022,"China Evergrande Group has blamed a “drastic change” in the company’s prospects for a delay to publishing its annual results but has promised investors that it will reveal how it plans to restructure its massive debts of $300bn by the end of July. Evergrande, which has been kept alive by government-run rescue operation since it defaulted on $22.7bn worth of overseas debts in December, said audit work would not be completed by the 31 March deadline. It promised to “further enhance communications” with investors. The turmoil at the stricken company was underlined when it also announced its property services unit had discovered a $2bn hole in its accounts. Evergrande said it had launched an investigation into how banks had seized the cash, which had apparently been pledged as security for third party guarantees without the property services unit’s knowledge. It described the problem as a “major incident”. The seizure of the funds, which the property services unit discovered when it was preparing its annual report, underscores the turmoil at Evergrande, which said it would hire King & Wood Mallesons as an additional legal adviser. It will also increase fears among foreign creditors that they will never see their money. Tim Symes, insolvency and asset recovery partner at the international law firm Stewarts, said the seizure of the cash by local banks would have repercussions for confidence in investing in China. “This significant development will feed the concerns by international bondholders that their interests will be subordinated by domestic interests,” he said. “What doesn’t help is the lack of information coming out to the international bondholders, hampering the ability to report to investors on the present situation and the likely fate of the bonds. This situation has wider consequences that may ultimately affect future decisions on investment in Chinese company bonds.” Several other major property developers, including Hopson Development Holdings and Ronshine, have delayed their results or seen their auditors resign amid concern that the annual reporting season will reveal more weaknesses in China’s giant real estate sector. A wave of defaults in the sector has rattled investors and while state intervention has quelled market concern over a disorderly collapse of Evergrande, investors are still in the dark over whether they will recoup their money. Evergrande, once China’s top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $300bn in liabilities, defaulted on overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors, and complete projects and homes. Shares in Evergrande and other Chinese property companies soared last week thanks to an announcement by vice premier Liu He that the government in Beijing would be urging the rollout of market-friendly policies to support the economy. But the debt crisis in the industry – brought on intially by a Beijing-led crackdown on reckless lending – continues to worsen. On the same day as Liu made his speech last week, China’s third-biggest property developer, Sunac, was downgraded by the credit agency S&P because of concerns that it might not be able to meet its huge debt repayments of nearly $4bn due this year. Investors have been left hanging on for more information from Evergrande after it announced in January that it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months. The developer set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring. “With the broad support and understanding from the majority of creditors … we strive to release the preliminary restructuring proposal by the end of July,” Chen Yong, a member of the committee, told investors on Tuesday. As part of its plans to divest assets to repay some of its offshore debt, the developer is working to sell its Yuen Long land parcel in Hong Kong as well as the Evergrande Centre commercial building, said Evergrande board member Liang Senlin. Trading in shares of Evergrande, its property services unit Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd, and electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd have been suspended since Monday. Liang said on the investor call the developer was trying to draft in strategic investors in both the electric vehicle and property services units to restore value – a goal it has been pursuing for roughly a year without much success. Siu said the EV unit aimed to start mass production in June of its inaugural electric car, the Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicle, after getting approval to start sales last week. Some of the investors who attended the call were not impressed with the assurances from management. “They mainly explained why the trading of stocks is suspended. There was no new information and the situation remained the same,” said a bondholder who was on the call, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

3/23/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russian forces of seizing a humanitarian convoy near Mangush west of Mariupol. “Employees of the state emergency service and bus drivers have been taken captive. We are doing everything to set our people free and unblocked the movement of humanitarian cargo,” he said in his latest address on Telegram. He said about 100,000 people remained in Mariupol “in inhumane conditions. In a total blockade. Without food, water, medication. Under constant shelling, under constant bombing”. Russian forces are now inside the besieged southern city, a senior US defence official said. Two “super-powerful bombs” rocked Mariupol on Tuesday even as rescue efforts were ongoing, local authorities said. The deputy head of Kyiv’s police force has accused Russia of using white phosphorous munitions in the city of Kramatorsk in Donetsk. Oleksiy Biloshytskiy shared online footage, which could not be independently verified, of material burning fiercely underneath a pile of aggregate. “Another use of phosphorus ammunitions in Kramatorsk,” he said. Zelenskiy will speak virtually at the Nato summit in Brussels on Thursday, where US president Joe Biden is also planning to push for new sanctions against Russia. “Three important summits are scheduled this week: G7, Nato and the EU,” he said. “New packages of sanctions, new support.” About 300,000 people in the occupied southern city of Kherson are running out of food and medical supplies, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry said. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall into Russian hands since the invasion began on 24 February. Russia plans to unleash a “great terror” on Kherson by kidnapping residents and taking them across the Russian border, an FSB whistleblower has claimed. The Kremlin was no longer willing to “play nicely” with protesters in the Ukrainian city, a letter said. Russian forces have only three further days of fuel, food and ammunition left to conduct the war after a breakdown in their supply chains, Ukrainian military commanders have claimed. The statements were described as “plausible” by western officials although they said they were unable to corroborate the analysis. Russian forces have “kidnapped” 2,389 children from the Russian-controlled territories of Luhansk and Donetsk, the US embassy in Kyiv has said, citing figures by Ukraine’s foreign ministry. The embassy said: “This is not assistance. It is kidnapping.” At least one person has died after drones attacked a scientific institute in the capital, Kyiv, AFP reports. Rescuers were seen removing a body from the scene, as smoke rose from the seven-storey building at the Institute for Superhard Materials in north-west Kyiv, part of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine. The Ukrainian health minister, Viktor Lyashko, said 10 hospitals had been completely destroyed since Russia invaded. Other hospitals could not be restocked with medicines and supplies because of nearby fighting, the minister added. A Ukrainian journalist, Victoria Roshchyna, has been released from captivity by Russian forces, Ukrainian outlet Hromadske said. There is, however, growing concern about well-known photojournalist Maksym Levin, who was last reported to be on the frontline near Kyiv, but nobody has had any contact with him since 13 March.  The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has said it is time for Russia to end its “absurd” and “unwinnable” war in Ukraine, as the EU prepared to set up a “trust fund” aimed at helping Kyiv repel the invasion and rebuild afterwards. Speaking to reporters at the UN’s headquarters in New York, Guterres said the war was “going nowhere, fast”. The European Commission will set out plans on Wednesday for how people fleeing Ukraine will access jobs, education and housing in the EU, Reuters reports. Maroš Šefčovič, the commission’s vice-president, said the bloc must ensure the right resources are in place to meet people’s needs after initial efforts were focused on receiving people at the border.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 28 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-28-of-the-invasion
