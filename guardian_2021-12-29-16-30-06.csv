12/29/2021,"A run on rapid antigen tests in chemists and supermarkets across Australia has left governments scrambling for supplies as they seek to change the way people get tested for Covid. Rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been available in the US, Europe and parts of Asia since March this year, but the Australian testing regime has relied on the more expensive PCR tests as its program’s cornerstone.  Now, as case numbers surge and the system comes under increasing strain, state and federal governments have sought to promote RATs as an intermediate step before people join a queue to be tested. In response RATs have been flying off shelves in supermarkets and pharmacies, raising concerns about a lack of supply. (CW: dead animal)Australians looking for the last Rapid Antigen Test, circa 2021 pic.twitter.com/oagYnK9u4C Jini Maxwell, a games journalist from Melbourne, said that while they had been able to easily find tests a week and a half ago, they had struggled to find any since Christmas “anywhere”. “There are two chemists near me that I’ve been checking every day that have been sold out for the past three or four days,” they said. Maxwell said that when they finally found a chemist who did have them on Thursday, the shelves were bare by the time they arrived and they were told to come back in an hour while the shop restocked. “I think it represents another massive failure of the federal government to provide adequately for the Australian people during a two-year pandemic,” they said. The Australian Medical Association vice-president, Dr Chris Moy, said the lack of availability amounted to a “market failure”. “You can’t get them. And people really don’t have a reasonable idea about when to use them,” he said. “In a public health response, the government has to ensure that, if they’re going to rely on the private system, the private system is supported so there isn’t a market failure when we really need it.” At beginning of Gov plan to open up, AMA asked and advocated for a clear plan to ensure ACCESS for RATs and clear POLICIES for their use, for this very time which was predicted The Pharmacy Guild of Australia national president, Trent Twomey, said though “tens of millions” of tests are on their way to Australia, they will probably not be available until late January. “This transition [from a focus on PCR tests to RATs] will take weeks, not days. We will have regional outages,” Twomey said. “There are millions coming in the pipeline, there’s tens of millions coming. The issue is what happens in the next fortnight. “We’re airfreighting what we can from overseas, and they will come into play in the next days and weeks. But the big shipments, the ones that are the orders placed with manufacturers, will take several weeks.” Though it is unclear how governments will distribute the supplies they are buying, Twomey said by late January RATs should be widely available. “They’ll be everywhere,” he said. “Those supplies coming towards the end of January will be available through supermarkets and pharmacies, and the supplies available in the next few days will be available through community pharmacies.” The prime minister, Scott Morrison, sought to reassure Australians on Wednesday. He said RATs were different to vaccines as there were many more manufacturers worldwide and governments had been working to secure supplies. These include the 34m additional tests announced by the Victorian state government and the 30m additional tests ordered by New South Wales. As these bulk orders will take time to fill, the prime minister said the private sector would fill the gap, describing the tests as a “precious commodity” in managing the spread of Covid-19. “When you start providing tests through other methods, then you need to be very clear about where and who so they can estimate how many stocks I need in my pharmacy or supermarket,” Morrison said. However, the tests will not be available in Western Australia, where RATs remain banned, despite calls from the Pharmacy Guild’s state branch for this ban to be overturned. Only the state’s chief health officer, Andy Robertson, can overturn the ban, which can see individuals fined up to $20,000 and companies up to $100,000 for administering them.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) maintains a list of approved rapid antigen tests for use within Australia. Most approved RATs are sourced from manufacturers in China, the US and Germany and have to be repackaged into TGA-approved packaging before they can be distributed within Australia. This is to ensure the packaging language is in English and the instructions are clearly explained in a way that ensures they can be used at home. Twomey said industry does not “play favourites” when it comes to supplying different states and territories, but can only quickly respond to changes where governments liaise with industry about changes to policy ahead of time. “Those you don’t hear from, you can’t work with,” he said.",News/Australia news,Run on rapid antigen tests leaves Australian governments scrambling for supplies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/29/run-on-rapid-antigen-tests-leaves-australian-governments-scrambling-for-supplies
12/29/2021,"It was June 1981 and I was 18. I stood in the dock at Camberwell Green magistrates court in south London. I was just about to receive my sentence for my role in the Brixton uprising of that April, after being arrested for assaulting a police officer. Ignoring the summary of my case, I stared into the public gallery. Relatives of the other six accused sat there in quiet, hopeful silence. I imagined they were mums, dads, aunts, uncles, siblings and grandparents. But not one belonged to me. I studied their faces, trying to comprehend what it might be like to have someone of your own blood supporting you. I tried to picture what my own parents looked like and what they might feel as I was handed down my sentence. If my mother were present, would she be weeping? I barely heard the 12‑month custodial term being given to me.  As I glanced at my fellow accused, I suddenly became very resentful. I guessed they would be visited by relatives wherever they were sent. For me, there was no one. Not even a second cousin. There were numerous times I had felt isolated, especially growing up in the notorious Shirley Oaks children’s home in Croydon, after being abandoned by my father when I was two. But I had never felt so alone as in the moment I peered into that public gallery at the court. No one gives a fuck about you, Alex. They took me away in one of those security vans with the blackened windows. As I sat in my cubicle, I wondered if there were any quick and easy ways that I could end my pathetic existence. After being taken to a large holding cell near Lambeth Walk, I was driven to Wormwood Scrubs in west London. For some reason, the jangling of bunched keys and clanging of metal doors seemed much louder in the prison environment than anywhere else. I was given my stiff prison uniform and escorted to my cell. They opened the door and pushed me inside. I closed my eyes, trying to ready myself for the suicide to which I had committed inside the prison van. The closing door resounded behind me. Opening my eyes, I saw that I would be sharing my cell with a Rastafarian who looked at least 20 years older than me. He introduced himself as Simeon and offered me a cup of tea. I declined and refused to speak to him. I wanted to be left to writhe in my own self-pity so I could devise a plan to end my miserable days. But Simeon persisted in wanting to become acquainted. Besides, it is impossible to find your own space within a tiny shared cell. The tension between us became unbearable, especially as he had a diarrhoea issue. Eventually, we came to blows. Or rather, he came to blows and I received them. At the conclusion of our fist-to-fist, I sat in a corner, bawling my lungs out. It was not so much because of the pain Simeon had inflicted, but because of the hard ache of childhood abuse and trauma. Up to that point, no doctor had ever described to me what a breakdown feels like, but I think I was very close to one. Luckily, Simeon took pity on me and insisted that I tell him my story. During that long night, the stench of excrement climbing into my nostrils, I did. He didn’t say much, but every now and again he nodded. He understood too well that I was disconnected from my roots, culture and people from the moment I was taken into care at two and a half. He took it upon himself to reconnect me. He pushed CLR James’s The Black Jacobins into my eager hands. “This will tell you ah liccle something about where you come from and where you stand in the struggle,” he said. Although my education had stalled, with numerous suspensions and three expulsions, I had always had the ability to read well. When I was five, I started to read the comics and magazines that were sometimes discarded on my dormitory floor. Little did I know that it was boosting my aptitude for the written word. Any novel or text that Simeon fed me, I gobbled up. I read Dickens, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, John Steinbeck and so many others. Through reading, I discovered that I wasn’t alone in having a difficult start in life. In the silence of the night, Simeon and I would discuss African civilisations. He would teach me about the continent’s kings and queens. He schooled me on the struggle for black liberation in South Africa, Angola, Mozambique and other countries. He introduced me to the life of Marcus Garvey and how he not only inspired the fight for equality for black people in the Caribbean, but also influenced the birth of the civil rights movement in the US. Together, we would try to decipher Bob Marley songs. We would sing the Wailers’ Get Up, Stand Up and Dennis Brown’s Three Meals a Day. He would laugh at my impressions of the reggae artists Barrington Levy and Johnny Osbourne. Simeon became a mentor and a father to me. I didn’t feel alone any more. I released the rope that I had clutched and held on to from the moment I gazed into the public gallery in court. Just before I completed my sentence, Simeon instructed me: “Alex, your life, and all those of the underclass, is just as valuable as anyone else’s in this world; never forget that.” With that mantra repeating in my head, I started to write. Initially, reggae lyrics and poems about my lived experience. My fables are essentially the tales of the underclass or, as we used to say in Brixton, the sufferah. Whatever I achieve in this old writing game is down to the conversion I experienced under Simeon in Wormwood Scrubs. The stories are already there, sometimes going unnoticed, ignored or rejected. All I do is try to make them important. I will be for ever grateful to him. Alex Wheatle’s latest novel, Cane Warriors, is out now (Andersen Press, £7.99).

12/29/2021,"My daughter faces having nowhere to live because of billing mistakes by British Gas. Her landlord served notice, in order to sell the property she was renting, and she was unable to find any other property to rent locally. She decided to buy a house, but her mortgage application was declined as her credit record showed defaults on her British Gas account. She had installed a prepayment gas meter during lockdown due to financial concerns but, unbeknownst to her, there was a duplicate gas account in her name. It’s this that British Gas had declared in default. British Gas has admitted this was an error, but has not removed the defaults. She is likely to lose the house and no one seems to care.SB, Newcastle Your daughter is among countless people barred from the property ladder because of billing errors by a third party. It’s inexcusable that, having identified a mistake, British Gas did not immediately correct it. The mistake, it turns out, is that the switch from a credit account to a prepayment gas meter last year was not completed on the company’s system. That meant that the old credit account remained open and appeared to be in default. British Gas managed to amend the credit report instantly when I queried it, just in time for your daughter to secure the mortgage.  Incorrect information on a credit file should be raised directly with the credit reference agency in question. It can add a notice of correction while it investigates.

12/29/2021,"Interest in anime, gaming and K-pop is fuelling a boom in Korean and Japanese university degrees that is helping to revive modern languages departments struggling with falling enrolments. Acceptances to study Korean more than trebled from 50 to 175 between 2012 and 2018, while Japanese places grew by 71% in the same period, according to a report published this year by the University Council of Modern Languages (UCML). More students now study Korean than Russian, and more take Japanese than Italian, the report shows.Experts who spoke to the Guardian said this was due to the popularity of east Asian culture – in particular K-pop and J-pop, Japanese video games, anime and popular films such as Parasite, and series such as the violent survival drama Squid Game – which has been boosted by their accessibility on platforms such as Netflix and Spotify.  According to Netflix data, the South Korean series Squid Game is comfortably its most viewed show of all time, with 1.65bn hours of the series streamed in the first four weeks after its release date. The rising popularity of Korean culture in particular, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean wave or K-wave, or hallyu, is influencing trends in a number of sectors, from cosmetics and fashion to food and household appliances. At the heart of the K-wave is K-pop, which in 2017 was already estimated to be a nearly $5bn industry. The South Korean K-pop group BTS set a new record and made headlines for achieving the most YouTube views for a music video debut – more than 101.1bn within 24 hours for their 2020 song Dynamite. Emma Cayley, the UCML chief executive, said: “It is clear that there has been a shift away from more traditionally taught European languages to non-European.” She said this included Arabic and Chinese, which combined with Japanese and Korean are driving the recovery of the study of languages and culture in universities. A recent UCML study based on universities self-reporting their language provision suggested the proportion of universities offering Japanese rose from 19% in 2018 to 39% in 2020-21, while a small increase was observed in departments offering Korean. Lecturers say students often start studying Korean and Japanese as a hobby while at school on language-learning platforms such as Duolingo, with recent figures in the UK showing Japanese was the fastest-growing language and Korean the fourth fastest. “They started learning Japanese just casually, for fun, and then they thought ‘this is fun’ so they want to study more seriously either as a degree or as an optional subject,” said Kazuki Morimoto, a Japanese lecturer at the University of Leeds. Morimoto said he had noticed a shift away from students opting to combine Japanese with business or economics 10 to 20 years ago to improve their job prospects, towards students studying the language and culture by itself for the love of it, although many do still find jobs connected to Japan as graduates. He thinks young people have been influenced by the spread of the culture on social media as well as by a strategic programme of cultural diplomacy initiated by the Japanese government in the run-up to the rugby World Cup and Tokyo Olympics. Many students were also drawn to the prospect of a year in Japan, he added. Jaeuk Park, a Korean lecturer at Leeds, said his students typically studied Korean as a result of their love for K-pop and K-dramas, although some were also interested in understanding more about North Korea, a notoriously secretive nation. Sarah Keith, who researches Korean popular culture at Macquarie University in Australia, said its appeal to westerners was a result of “how global culture is now”, with many Korean creators having grown up consuming Hollywood films and European culture. As a result, their cultural outputs are a “balance of familiarity and novelty” that westerners find compelling. “For example in Squid Game, the dramatic pacing and arc of the show are intelligible to viewers worldwide, but at the same time it engages with specifically Korean themes which are totally new to foreign audiences,” she said.",News/Education,Interest in anime and K-pop drive boom in Korean and Japanese degrees,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/29/interest-anime-k-pop-drive-boom-korean-japanese-degrees
12/29/2021,"As I set out for the Swanscombe peninsula from Greenhithe station, on the south bank of the Thames near Dartford in Kent, on a dull winter day, I tell myself to be realistic. I’m heading for Britain’s newest site of special scientific interest (SSSI) but it’s not going to be a wildflower meadow or an ancient woodland. This is a former industrial site situated on a part of the river long associated with the hidden, the forgotten and the thrown-away. But something magical happens. Following signs for the England Coast Path, I fall through a wormhole in time and find myself in an unexpectedly lovely waterside village of flint cottages, old ship chandlers and cosy pubs. Here, in Greenhithe’s high street, is a slice of the old Thames. The air heavy is with woodsmoke and the only sound is of waves slapping against the banks. Out on the river, close to the spot where Sir John Franklin and his crew set sail on their ill-fated quest to discover the Northwest Passage through the Arctic, a flock of redshank are probing the mud as a tug guides a container ship out to sea.  I feel my step slow, my mind ease as I follow the river through the once-rolling parkland of Ingress Abbey, now blighted by the pile-up of architectural styles that makes up most waterside developments. On the far bank I can see the industrial sprawl of West Thurrock. Kent has fared little better than Essex when it comes to poor planning decisions but here and there pockets of land have escaped. The Swanscombe peninsula, a mile or two east of Greenhithe, is one such place. A former cement works, abandoned in the 1990s, this landscape has been left in glorious, unfettered abandonment for decades, allowing nature to reclaim it. The peninsula now comprises 259 hectares (640 acres) of wetland, woodland, lakes and, yes, flower-rich meadows. As I climb on to the sea wall, I see a large reed bed stretching away, its edges backlit by silver birches, those most pioneering of trees. They dust the site with spangles of gold. Deep within this swamp land I hear the ping-ping-ping of bearded tits, elegant and often hidden, peach-coloured birds with drooping black moustaches. I’m astonished. How could this area have remained vulnerable and unprotected for so long? Sadly, so often we fail to see the value in places until they are threatened. Despite its designation as a protected landscape, the Swanscombe peninsula is earmarked to be turned into a theme park by London Resort Company Holdings, a project considered by the government to be “nationally significant infrastructure” thereby skipping what little planning protection is left in the hands of local councils. In order to save this wetland, conservation bodies including Buglife, the RSPB and Kent Wildlife Trust stepped in, and Natural England declared it an SSSI because of its importance for a number of scarce insects, plants and birds. But even with this level of protection, the developers hope to get the green light for their plans, claiming that the funfair will boost the economy of the area and that the fragile habitats can be recreated elsewhere. I follow the coastal path around the shoreline. There is no escaping the fact that this landscape is not instantly attractive. A 190-metre pylon strings wires high across the Thames, and derelict buildings crumble beneath ivy. However, it is on our former industrial sites that nature shows us what rewilding really means. Birch and bramble clamber across piles of rubble; orchids bloom alongside the trackways. In the spring, bumblebees search for nectar among the coltsfoot. It is not only nature that benefits from such places. There is peace here, as rare as hens’ teeth on the fringes of the city, and I can picture what a wonderful place this could be to connect children in a largely deprived area with nature. Despite the industry, there is something prehistoric about this land. It resembles the places our ancestors would have hunted. Half a mile away is the Swanscombe skull site, where some of the earliest-known human remains in Britain were discovered, those of a woman who lived 400,000 years ago. Undoubtedly, she would have foraged along these shores and gathered ducks’ eggs in a wetland not so different from this. The coast path emerges on to a creek. Here a community of houseboat owners are working away to patch and repair their crafts. Thames barges lie docked for the winter and stonechats bob between the piles of timber and old railway carriages. These edgeland communities are inhabited by people who wish to live unfettered, too, and undoubtedly are as vulnerable to eviction as the wildlife. As dusk falls, I follow the path back to the river. The lights from the QEII bridge pool out across the water. The drivers rushing overhead probably have little knowledge of the importance of the oasis tucked away down here. Post-industrial sites are not always easy to love, but the more you look, the more they reward you. I can only hope that the protection this place has been given is enough to prevent its loss.",Lifestyle/Travel,"They want to build a theme park here?

12/29/2021,"John Davies’ family has farmed in the hills and valleys of mid Wales just north of Brecon since the 19th century and his most cherished times now are when he is working shoulder to shoulder with his 91-year-old father, Elwyn, and 20-year-old son, Brychan. “That’s incredibly rewarding,” says Davies, 55. “There’s a balance there. Dad has seen it all, done it all. Brychan brings in the new things from college. It’s good to see that blend of experience and ambition and I’m in the middle, the bridge.  “Family farming businesses are incredibly important in Wales, the backbone of our industry. We don’t have a large agribusiness kind of structure but we’ve lived in these hills for six generations and we’d like to see it carry on for another six. It’s about community, culture and language. It’s about building for each generation.” But that building will not be straightforward. “This is a period of great volatility,” says Davies, who is standing down as president of NFU Cymru after four years in office. “We need to work incredibly hard to make sure we get a fair deal.” The future of the Welsh family farm does appear to hang in the balance. Post-Brexit trade deals with countries such as New Zealand and Australia make sheep and beef farmers worry that they will not be able to compete with cheaper imports. Other pressures – and temptations – include the corporations circling family farms, buying up their land to plant acres of trees to offset their carbon emissions. Estate agents have cold-called farmers in Davies’ neighbourhood asking if they want to sell up. “We do need to plant trees, but we need to make sure we do not lose farms to greenwashing operations,” said Davies. And farmers are feeling the pressure from environmental campaigners, many of whom would prefer re-wilding schemes to take the place of traditional sheep and cattle farms. “We have to get away from the idea that cows and sheep are bad and woodland is good,” says Davies. “It does not move the argument forward when you talk about sheep-wrecked landscapes. That is deeply offensive to our communities and culture. We’ve got to move the debate to a different place.” The fragility of the farming life is keenly felt in Davies’ village, Merthyr Cynog. It nestles beneath the upland of Mynydd Epynt, once a vibrant farming community that was cleared in 1940 to make way for a military training ground. The 219 inhabitants of the 54 farms had just three months to pack up and leave. Livelihoods, a way of life and, to a large extent, the Welsh language were wrecked. Elwyn Davies, who was a young boy when his family was forced to move, said it led to huge changes. “It was good land, quite steep but fertile. Everyone had a few acres and worked well together. Everything was disrupted, a whole community gone. It took many years to rebuild.” Conscious that farms across Wales are under threat, the UK government’s Welsh affairs committee has launched an inquiry into their future, examining not just the economic aspects but the damage the loss of every farm does to the local community. Its members heard that while, according to the last census, about 19% of people in Wales speak Welsh, more than 40% of workers in the farming industry speak the language. Welsh farming heartlands tend to also be the language strongholds. While Elwyn speaks Welsh, John does not, largely as a result of the clearance. The revival of the language in schools now means that Brychan does speak Welsh. “For the language to prosper, farming is key,” said John. “When we’re at the market in Dolgellau, Welsh is the main language. You get a better deal if you can haggle in Welsh.” Davies is proud of the work his farm does to improve the environment, from planting trees on steep ground that cannot be used for growing crops to creating new ponds and wetlands. “As an industry we have a clear ambition to be net zero by 2040 and provide the most climate-friendly food in the world,” he said. He remains hopeful. “We’ll have to evolve, adapt, deliver what is wanted but we have a great climate to grow food, a fantastic climate. And if we’re backed into a corner we’ll make a stand.” Yet another problem for Welsh farming is demographics. The average age of a farmer in Wales is 60 and only 3% are under 35. That makes the attitude of people like John so crucial. Like his father, young Brychan is optimistic. “People are always going to need food and the issue of food miles is a big one. I don’t think we’ll going anywhere anytime soon.”",News/Environment,"‘It’s about community, culture and language’: Welsh family farmers dig in for their future",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/29/its-about-community-culture-and-language-welsh-family-farmers-dig-in-for-their-future
