4/17/2022,"A woman has died and three other people are in hospital after being pulled from the water at a beach on the New South Wales south coast on Easter Sunday. Ten people had to be rescued from the ocean at Surf Beach, about 8km south of Batemans Bay, by surf lifesavers and members of the public. NSW police said emergency services were called just after 2pm to reports of a group of swimmers in distress. A woman in her 40s was treated at the scene, before being airlifted to Batemans Bay hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later. Three other swimmers, a woman and two men, were assessed at the scene and taken to hospital, with one man airlifted to Canberra hospital. The other swimmers did not require hospitalisation. In a statement, NSW police said a search of the beach was conducted to see if there were any other swimmers requiring assistance. “The Westpac Rescue Helicopter and Surf Life Saving Australia Helicopter conducted an overhead search of the beaches to ensure no one else required assistance,” police said. “Officers from south coast police district have commenced inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident and a report will be prepared for the information of the coroner.” NSW Ambulance inspector Faye Stockman praised members of the public for assisting and said it was a reminder of the importance of CPR training. “Paramedics arrived to a very chaotic scene, with a number of people requiring medical attention for various conditions,” Stockman said. “It’s truly heartbreaking to have lost a life here today, especially knowing this group of people was likely enjoying an extended break for the holiday weekend.” Eight ambulances and a rescue helicopter were all dispatched to the scene.",News/Australia news,Woman dies after 10 people rescued from water at Batemans Bay beach,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/17/woman-dies-after-10-people-rescued-from-water-at-batemans-bay-beach
4/17/2022,"Instagram is failing to remove accounts that attract hundreds of sexualised comments for posting pictures of children in swimwear or partial clothing, even after they are flagged to it through the in-app reporting tool. Instagram’s parent company, Meta, claims it takes a zero-tolerance approach to child exploitation. But accounts that have been flagged as suspicious through the in-app reporting tool have been ruled acceptable by its automated moderation technology and remain live. In one case, an account posting photos of children in sexualised poses was reported, using the in-app reporting tool, by a researcher. Instagram provided a same-day response saying that “due to high volume”, it had not been able to view the report, but that its “technology has found that this account probably doesn’t go against our community guidelines”. The user was advised to block or unfollow the account, or report it again. It remained live on Saturday, with more than 33,000 followers. Similar accounts – known as “tribute pages” – were also found to be running on Twitter. One account, which posted pictures of a man performing sexual acts to images of a 14-year-old TikTok influencer, was deemed not to break Twitter’s rules after being reported using the in-app tools – despite him suggesting in posts that he was seeking to connect with people to share illegal material. “Looking to trade some younger stuff,” one of his tweets said. It was removed after the campaign group Collective Shout posted about it publicly. The findings raise concerns about the platforms’ in-app reporting tools, with critics saying the content appeared to be allowed to remain live because it did not meet a criminal threshold – despite being linked to suspected illegal activity. Often, the accounts are used for “breadcrumbing” – where offenders post technically legal images but arrange to meet up online in private messaging groups to share other material. Andy Burrows, head of online safety policy at the NSPCC, described the accounts as a “shop window” for paedophiles. “Companies should be proactively identifying this content and then removing it themselves,” he said. “But even when it is reported to them, they are judging that it’s not a threat to children and should remain on the site.” He called for MPs to tackle “loopholes” in the proposed online safety bill – which is intended to regulate social media firms and will be debated in parliament on 19 April. They should, he said force companies to tackle not only illegal content, but also that which is clearly harmful but may not meet the criminal threshold. Lyn Swanson Kennedy of Collective Shout, an Australia-based charity that monitors exploitative content globally, said the platforms were relying on external organisations to do their content moderation for them. “We are calling on platforms to address some of these very concerning activities which put underage girls particularly at serious risk of harassment, exploitation and sexualisation,” she said. Meta, Instagram’s parent company, said it had strict rules against content that sexually exploits or endangers children, and that it removed it when it became aware of it. “We’re also focused on preventing harm by banning suspicious profiles, restricting adults from messaging children they’re not connected with and defaulting under-18s to private accounts,” a spokesperson said. Twitter said the accounts reported to it had now been permanently suspended for violating its rules. A spokesperson said: “Twitter has zero tolerance for any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. We aggressively fight online CSE and have heavily invested in technology … to enforce our policy.” Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a non-profit thinktank, said: “Relying on automated detection, which we know cannot keep up with simple hate speech, let alone cunning, determined, child sex exploitation rings, is an abrogation of the fundamental duty to protect children.”",News/Society,Instagram under fire over sexualised child images,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/17/instagram-under-fire-over-sexualised-child-images
4/17/2022,"Labour faces an escalating internal row over the treatment of climate crisis protesters after a shadow cabinet minister backed calls for nationwide injunctions to stop them blocking critical roads and fuel supplies. Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, called for immediate and wide-ranging bans on protesters’ tactics to be put in place last week. Reed said ministers should “get on with their jobs” and block further action from the Just Stop Oil group after about 40 arrests were made at Inter Terminals in Grays, Essex, last Monday. Others were arrested at Kingsbury oil terminal in Warwickshire. Further disruption was caused throughout the week following a series of protests by Extinction Rebellion, with several London bridges closed on Friday as a result of the group’s action. “Motorists were already being hammered by prices at the pump, and now millions can’t even access fuel,” Reed said. “The Conservatives need to stop standing idly by and put an end to this disruption that is causing misery for motorists.” However, Labour’s frontbench position has angered some MPs and prompted a growing backlash within the party, with senior figures on the left publicly stating their support for public protest. The issue could now flare up at the party’s conference later this year. Asked about the comments, Jamie Driscoll, the metro mayor of the North of Tyne, said that history always judged protesters differently to the “establishment of that era”. “Were the suffragettes dangerous radicals who refused to understand their place?” he said. “Were the Tolpuddle Martyrs treasonous conspirators for wanting fair pay? Were the Stonewall rioters immoral to want gay liberation? Was Nelson Mandela just a subversive terrorist? What’s the Labour party for if it’s not to fight for a better world? Protest is an essential part of healthy democracy. If an individual oversteps the mark, there are already laws in place. The police don’t need new powers. “If you’re not doing something about the climate emergency, it’s probably because you don’t understand quite how dangerous it is. Either that, or you’re profiting from destroying our planet. These protests shouldn’t even be needed – ending fossil fuel investment is economic and environmental common sense. Our government should be investing in renewable energy, clean public transport and insulating homes. Yet Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak and co are actively encouraging new oil and gas fields in the North Sea.” Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change secretary and former party leader, has yet to publicly endorse Reed’s demands, but aides said he agreed with the position. Miliband has previously described blockades as “inappropriate and counterproductive”. Others on Labour’s frontbench are said to have concerns about the demand for injunctions. There is also a growing grassroots backlash on Labour’s left wing over the party’s official stance. Chris Saltmarsh, co-founder of Labour for a Green New Deal, said his group was “seriously concerned to see Labour’s frontbench calling for such a harsh response to peaceful protest calling for action on the climate crisis”. “The protesters’ demand to stop new fossil fuel extraction is a basic one which should be uncontroversial to a Labour party claiming commitment to decarbonisation and a Green New Deal,” he said. “Instead of trying to outdo the government on petty authoritarianism, Starmer and his team should focus on making the case for a positive and transformative vision to tackle both the climate and cost of living crises.” Senior figures in the party are relishing any battle, however. A Labour source said the party was taking the stance for the simple reason that it was “where the voters are”. They added: “It’s a commonsense position. Our position on climate change is strong and this doesn’t change the fact we think it’s the most pressing issue facing the planet, but we’re recognising you don’t solve it by annoying workers.”",News/Politics,Labour split by leadership call for action against climate crisis blockades,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/17/labour-split-by-leadership-call-for-action-against-climate-crisis-blockades
4/17/2022,"Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker is not a choreographer who believes in making life easy. Her new work is an unbroken 135 minutes of dance. I thought the first 110 minutes were wondrous; I found the rest too much. Dance of this intricate intensity is hard. The dancers get a break, but we, the audience, do not. It becomes exhausting. I suspect that is part of De Keersmaeker’s point. Mystery Sonatas/for Rosa is not an entertainment as much as a meditation, a contemplation set to the Mystery Sonatas by Heinrich Biber, music for strings and keyboard to accompany the recitation of the rosary. De Keersmaeker follows the 17th-century composer’s structure – moving in groups of five from joy to sorrow to glory – but twists it to her own intent by making the piece a tribute to five Rosas – Bonheur (artist), Luxemburg (revolutionary), Parks (civil rights activist), Vergaelen (a nun who taught De Keersmaeker at school) and Rosa, the 15-year-old climate activist who died in the Belgian floods of 2021. (De Keersmaeker’s company is also called Rosas.) These women, and the biblical references that underlie the music, are evoked rather than explained. There are constant silent groupings of tension and resistance that recall paintings and scenes from the Bible. Mary Magdalene, Mary and Jesus all seem to be there. A gesture where the dancers raise their arms, fists lightly clenched, made me think of Palm Sunday crowds as well as protestors. It all looks beautiful. Minna Tiikkainen’s design carves the space with her own lighting; a great metal loop overhead reflects different colours. At one moment, the dancers lie beneath white beams of light as solid as corrugated iron; at another, the shape of a tomb seems to appear; when (I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden unexpectedly breaks into the soundtrack, the stage is full of glistening red. Between the sections there is a brilliant flash. Fauve Ryckebusch’s costumes have a rare sense of texture: net dresses over shorts for both men and women, a little front-only top for Sophia Dinkel, bare chest for Franck Gizycki. Later there’s a red shirt for Mariana Miranda, a dress in the colours of Ukraine for Rafa Galdino, jackets that shine and glow. The choreography is apparently structured around the shape of roses. A repeated movement sees the dancers (five initially, joined by two more) walk around like the spoke at the centre of a wheel, with one dancer running away at each turn. In one iteration, the movement is repeated, first turning forwards and then back. Steps are simple but telling. There is a lot of skipping and jumping and versions of the formal dances in the music. There are group dances, sometimes full of joy, and extended solos full of anguish. Both are built on circular shapes. Lav Crnčević collapses at the end of his agonised turning and is carried into the wings by Jacob Storer; the entire piece ends with Cintia Sebők crouched in engulfing darkness. By then, it has become an endurance test, but one shot through with moments both of magic and of mystery.",Arts/Stage,Mystery Sonatas/for Rosa review – an enigmatic endurance test,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/anne-teresa-de-keersmaeker-mystery-sonatas-for-rosa-sadlers-wells-london-review

Meandering on a skateboard may be his natural state, but Vile’s output is packed with melodies, down-to-earth observations and heavy-lidded good cheer: these are tunes that milkmen could happily whistle. His records aren’t hard to love, but this one just throws itself at you.

He’s happy to be opening for Neil Young, he sees “baby red maples growing in the hedges” – a mindset so beatifically in the moment, Vile could legitimately set himself up as a meditation guru.

In preparation for the next few days, when so many will say they’ve had enough of chocolate, let me introduce you to some dark(er) and delicious bars. The first is Luisa’s Whole Hazelnuts in 75% Solomon Islands cacao, £4/50g. I reached for this after a few days of chocolate abstinence expecting to feel worthy and nibble at it like one of the female actors in Hitchcock’s Rope (this is an obscure reference, but the girlfriend of one of the leads makes an olive last a really long time. I constantly try to emulate her). This was a bar full of hazelnuts and the chocolate was truly delicious, and because it’s 75% you can only feel good about yourself. Next is Born’s Blueberry and Almond, £5.50/60g. I expected to have a bite and then leave it, but this was unusual, perfectly balanced and shockingly delicious. I loved that the almonds in it were properly roasted and also the toasted buckwheat – it’s a delicious thing here. The blueberries give a bit of sweetness. Two dark milks for the diehards: Cocoa Retreat’s Kentish Cobnut Dark Milk, £6.25/45g, was epic. I am a big fan of Cocoa Retreat’s, but watch the bars, they look tiny, but before you know it you’ve scoffed 45g of chocolate. And Moka’s 58% Dark Milk from Ghana, £7.95/68g.

4/17/2022,"Lovers love a burbling plethora of adverbs: in Truly, Madly, Deeply, Juliet Stevenson tells Alan Rickman that she loves him really truly madly deeply passionately remarkably deliciously and, after a pause for thought, juicily. Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh worked through the entire adverbial gamut, initially as furtive adulterers and later as figures of almost viceregal splendour, but what Stephen Galloway emphasises is the almost lethal madness of their infatuation. Afflicted by what was then called manic depression, Leigh alternated between fits of derangement and alcoholic slumps, repeatedly stripping naked to frolic in the garden or invade the bedrooms of disconcerted house guests, then attempting suicide if there was a swimming pool handy. During one blow-up in what Galloway daintily calls their “froufrou abode”, Olivier hurled her at a marble tabletop, which left her with a gash on her temple and convinced him that they were “quite capable of murdering each other”. In some empurpled paragraphs, Galloway does his best to romanticise these paroxysms. Olivier, he asserts, was “drunk with desire” for Leigh’s “transcendent beauty” and he describes their first illicit encounters as if with his eye to a peephole: “hands, lips, limbs reached for each other with an urgency neither could control”. Loving madly, in their profession, meant loving histrionically. Leigh abandoned her first husband, Galloway suggests, because she felt miscast: marriage was like a boringly over-extended theatrical run. She and Olivier mimicked the couples in the Shakespeare plays they performed. First came Romeo and Juliet, in which Olivier was more athletic than amorous, then Antony and Cleopatra, which was sabotaged by Leigh’s kittenish mewing. Closest to home was their pairing in Macbeth, where they exposed the strain of an increasingly fractious partnership as well as their skill at killing off professional rivals. A pinch of kinky camp added spice. Clark Gable, Leigh’s co-star in Gone With the Wind, arrived on set with a phallic sock that his wife, Carole Lombard, knitted to keep the marital member snug. As a less virile equivalent, Olivier asked Leigh to send him her underwear and while stranded far from Hollywood he reported that he was “sitting naked with just my parts wrapped in your panties”. He claimed to love her with “a special kind of soul”, yet when she overdosed on sedatives he sent a letter in which he uncelestially ordered her to bend over, lower her drawers, raise her skirt and await chastisement: “Smack! Smack! Smack!” Their games lurched into pathological farce after Leigh began to hallucinate, succumbed to screaming fits on aeroplanes and spat obscenities at her lover Peter Finch while entangling him in “great passionate embraces”. A shrink at a Surrey asylum administered electroconvulsive therapy; another cast-off lover, himself only recently released from a psychiatric hospital, prescribed exorcism, with moody lighting, incense and mystical chants to cast out the devils that possessed her. Galloway is left wondering whether Olivier and Leigh enjoyed an “affinity of heart, mind and soul” or were overcome by a “devouring sexual greed”. The conundrum is solved dialectically; he concludes that passion is bipolar and “at times can seem like a mental illness”. All this frothing tends to blur the more public significance of their match. Galloway’s ecstatic, agonised couple were national symbols, enjoying a venerability that no celebrities today command. As Henry V, Olivier cried God for England in wartime and as Admiral Nelson in That Hamilton Woman he simultaneously fought off an invasion, though his actual military service consisted of giving orotund pep talks, with hot air as his weapon; at his medical exam, “he broke all records for blowing out a lot of breath for a very long time”. A child of the Raj, born in Darjeeling where her father was a cavalry officer, Leigh had her own imperial pedigree and was content for a time to play Olivier’s decorous consort. But during a Shakespearean tour of eastern Europe, she dropped the protocol. Prevailed upon to make an after-dinner speech in Zagreb, she slathered the local worthies with a glossary of abusive four-letter words, delivered while she maintained her ladylike composure; knowing no English, her victims nodded and applauded as she told them how boring they were. For once, Leigh gave a performance as dangerous as those of Olivier when he risked life and limb in his gratuitous acrobatic stunts on stage. Late in their careers, Olivier and Leigh undertook a calculated self-desecration. He personified the squalor of post-imperial Britain in John Osborne’s The Entertainer and she bravely portrayed two Tennessee Williams heroines – Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire and the sexually needy socialite in The Roman Spring of Mrs Stone – who grieve over their lost allure. Here, rather than in the patriotic zeal of Henry V or the feudal folderol of Gone With the Wind, lay their greatest achievement: having outlived Galloway’s “romance of the century”, they dragged the declining century from romance into seedy, dejected realism.

4/17/2022,"In the digital age, building a new library filled with old-fashioned printed books seems idealistic, almost quixotic.Not so in Barcelona. The city council is about to open a new €12m (£10m) library next month, the latest instalment in a programme that dates back 20 years. The library, in the working-class district of Sant Martí de Provençals, has been named in honour of the Colombian Nobel laureate Gabriel García Márquez. “The plan for the new library was under way when García Márquez died in 2014 so it was decided to name it in his honour because he and many other Latin American authors had a close relationship with the city,” said Neus Castellano, its chief librarian. “It’s a nod towards the role Barcelona has played in Latin American literature.” García Márquez lived in Barcelona from 1967 to 1975, arriving shortly after the publication of his groundbreaking magical realism novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. He already knew something of the city through his friend Ramón Vinyes, a Catalan writer and bookseller living in Colombia, who served as the model for “the wise Catalan” in One Hundred Years of Solitude. However, it was the Barcelona literary agent Carmen Balcells, one of the first to recognise the worth of the writers of the Latin American “boom”, who persuaded Gabo – as García Márquez was affectionately known – to move to the city. She continued as his agent until his death, as well as representing other luminaries of Latin American fiction such as Julio Cortázar, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes and Pablo Neruda. “They called Carmen Balcells ‘Mamá’,” Castellano said, because she did not just help them with their writing but with finding a place to live or schools for their children. In his book about the period, Aquellos Años del Boom (Those Boom Years), the journalist Xavi Ayén relates how Balcells once asked Gabo what he wanted for his birthday. “Three thousand dollars,” he replied. Thereafter the agent sent him $3,000 on his birthday for the rest of his life. Vargas Llosa, who also went on to win the Nobel prize in literature, describes disembarking in the old port, at the foot of the city’s famous La Rambla, accompanied by Julia, his wife, who was also – somewhat scandalously – his aunt, and whom he immortalised in novel Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter. “I walked up the Rambla,” Vargas Llosa later wrote. “Excited by the streets, clutching Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia, which I’d read on the voyage over.” García Márquez and Vargas Llosa were briefly neighbours but had a falling out, possibly over the latter’s second wife, during which the Peruvian punched García Márquez in the face. García Márquez was so proud of his black eye that he made a point of having it photographed. García Márquez described Barcelona as “a city where I can breathe”, and yet Spain was then as much of a dictatorship as many of the countries he and his fellow writers had left behind. Ayén points out that they arrived in a Barcelona literary world that was completely opposed to Francisco Franco’s regime and where alternative publishers were emerging. “It was a microclimate separated from the dictatorship,” he said. “These writers didn’t involve themselves in the anti-Franco struggle, with the exception of Vargas Llosa, who took part in anti-Franco demonstrations. At the time, he and García Márquez were both on the left but Gabo didn’t take part in demonstrations for fear that he’d be deported.” What they were involved in was revolutionary Latin American politics, especially Cuba. Their apartments were meeting points for visitors such as Fidel Castro’s chief adviser and Che Guevara’s family. Because of his political activism, Vargas Llosa had problems with the censor and was forced to make changes to his novel La Ciudad y los Perros (The Time of the Hero) because of the way he depicted authority figures. “There were just as many reasons to censor García Márquez, but because of his magical realism the authorities were unable to see them,” Ayén said. The new library that bears his name will be housed in a purpose-built 4,000 sq metre timber-framed building that has been awarded a gold LEED certificate, the highest rating for sustainability. It will specialise in Latin American literature and hold a collection of 40,000 relevant documents.",Arts/Books,Barcelona honours Gabriel García Márquez with new library ,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/17/barcelona-honours-gabriel-garcia-marquez-with-new-library
4/17/2022,"It is 50 years since the most principled decision about refugees in postwar Britain was taken. The then prime minister Ted Heath’s insistence on upholding Britain’s duty to protect the 28,000 Ugandan Asians expelled by Idi Amin showed political courage. Doing the right thing by them was broadly unpopular in 1972. Indeed, Whitehall panic in the face of Enoch Powell’s pressure saw the Foreign Office ask Bermuda and then the Falklands if they might provide an “island asylum” to limit the numbers who may come to Britain. Ugandan Asian migrants have contributed much to Britain. Their British-born children have enjoyed opportunities in professional life beyond their parents’ hopes. It could even be an indicator of integration that it is Priti Patel, the first British Asian woman to occupy a great office of state, who leads this government’s search for an asylum island for our times. On Thursday, the home secretary proudly unveiled her plan to send asylum seekers who reach Britain to Africa instead. The first snap poll, by YouGov, misunderstood the government policy, so asked respondents about a more moderate version. One in three people supports asylum seekers being sent to Rwanda while their claims are processed. But that “offshoring” idea has been ditched. The plan now is for Britain to just declare asylum claims inadmissible and deport people to Africa, letting them try their luck in Rwanda’s asylum system if they wish. It may take months to discover how far this plan is legal or practicable but it cannot claim to be popular. The politicians cannot blame the public for this policy. The “progressive” mind can find it hard to accept that people may be becoming more pro-immigration or can struggle to devise the strategies to reinforce that in politically polarising times. Brexit reflected a loss of public confidence in how governments managed immigration, so the post-2016 softening of attitudes seems counterintuitive. If the government is deliberately reheating and repolarising the asylum debate, might that untap something deep in the British psyche? Instead, to reheat and repolarise may bring diminishing returns. Support for reducing migration has not been lower for decades. The Conservatives now trail Labour on immigration, due to the corrosive impact of 10 years of making promises they could not keep on net migration. But Labour needs to speak to the pro-refugee mobilisation of liberal opinion and broader audiences too. It would help if the left did not caricature engageable “red wall” swing voters, largely drawn from the “balancer” middle of the spectrum of attitudes, as core Nigel Farage supporters. Though warmer, then, attitudes remain somewhat polarised. A quarter of people want large reductions in immigration, while one in five says they want numbers to go up. But beyond the fierce asylum arguments, there is quiet policy and public consensus on most other immigration questions: a broadly positive approach to managed migration. Labour accepts the points-based system for work visas now that Brexit has ended free movement. By ditching Theresa May’s impossible net migration target, Boris Johnson chose more open policies for students and post-study visas, lower salary thresholds for non-EU migrants and a new offer to bring hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers to Britain. So the mantra of the migration sceptics, that governments always foist immigration on an unwilling public, has never been less true. This mantra can make no sense of the Homes for Ukraine phenomenon, as Daily Mail and Observer readers share frustration at the Home Office red tape that prevents the public from bringing refugees to Britain. Attitudes to asylum are more complex. Dangerous journeys across the Channel are nobody’s idea of a safe or effective system for claiming asylum. Sympathy for those making perilous crossings is combined with concern at the visible lack of control. A third of the public are attracted by tough messages to deter people from claiming asylum in Britain, while another third think it unconscionable to consider any such thing. The general view is that a competent government would be able to combine compassion with control. Which means that critics of the Rwanda plan need solutions as well as critiques. An orderly, effective and humane system, which makes fair decisions within six months, may be more boring than the headline political stunts, but that is the task at hand. How Britain protects refugees has been contested in every era. We respond to the emotive story of the lives saved by the Kindertransport without always noticing that Britain did not want to take the adults too. That is why the rights of the postwar Refugee convention, ratified by Winston Churchill’s government, mattered. On its 70th anniversary last year, I heard people given sanctuary over those decades – from Hungary to Vietnam, Uganda to Syria – talk about what it had meant to them and why they want to “pay forward” that debt. The Homes for Ukraine surge offers an opportunity to extend the spirit animating it across groups. British Future’s research finds that those stepping forward to offer a roof are just the tip of the iceberg, with millions more keen to help in other ways. Spreading long-term contact with refugees across geographic and political divides would make the biggest long-term difference in entrenching the liberal shift in attitudes. So these are curious times, in which the biggest surge of pro-refugee public sentiment in living memory has ended with our government proposing to deport asylum seekers to Africa. Britain can be better than this. We can take pride in what is good in our mixed history of refugee protection, but only if we choose to act again in that spirit today.

4/17/2022,"It was one of the most eagerly awaited scientific announcements of all time, and it pitted the world of faith against the world of rational thought, under the glare of the media. So when cutting-edge carbon-14 tests found that the Shroud of Turin was a forgery, it seemed like the final chapter for a relic that had been revered for centuries as the cloth in which Christ’s body had been wrapped when he supposedly rose from the dead at the first Easter almost 2,000 years ago. But one man – David Rolfe, a film-maker whose documentary The Silent Witness had brought the shroud into the public eye in modern times, and who had converted to Christianity as a result of his research – wasn’t prepared to give up on it. He was convinced the carbon dating, carried out in 1988 under the direction of the British Museum and Oxford University, had been flawed. And now he claims he has the evidence to prove it. This week sees the release of a new film, Who Can He Be?, in which Rolfe argues that, far from the shroud being a definite dud, new discoveries in the past few years have again opened the question of its authenticity. So convinced is Rolfe that he’s issuing a challenge worth $1m to the British Museum. “If … they believe the shroud is a medieval forgery, I call on them to repeat the exercise, and create something similar today,” he says. “Because from all the evidence I’ve seen, if this is a forgery it’s the most ingenious forgery in history – and of course it dates back almost 2,000 years, to a time of far less sophisticated forgery techniques. “They said it was knocked up by a medieval conman, and I say: well, if he could do it, you must be able to do it as well. And if you can, there’s a $1m donation for your funds.” According to the gospel accounts, it was when they discovered Christ’s burial cloth on the floor of his tomb that his followers first believed he had risen from the dead. Across the centuries, the shroud has been venerated as that very piece of fabric. Rolfe became aware of it about 45 years ago, after he put out a request for ideas for documentaries, and the writer Ian Wilson, who had investigated the shroud – by then being kept at Turin Cathedral – got in touch. Rolfe was not a believer, but he found the history of the shroud fascinating. The documentary he went on to make won a Bafta in 1978, and brought the relic to international attention. “My programme at no point said it was authentic, but it did pose questions, such as how did the image of the crucified man get on to the cloth, and did its provenance fit with the timeline of Christ,” says Rolfe. The most powerful moment for him came when he took photographs of the four-metre-long shroud for the first time, and saw that the image of the dead man’s face was much more pronounced in the negatives. “It was almost as though it had been created for the photographic age,” says Rolfe. In the mid-1980s the Vatican, the owner of the shroud, agreed in principle that it could be dated using the latest technology, and entrusted the British Museum with the task. A few years later, the verdict made headlines around the world: the cloth dated from the 13th or 14th century, and could not possibly be authentic. It seemed the relic had had its day. But Rolfe, who is now in his early 70s, was determined to debunk the debunking. “Five [testing] protocols were agreed on, but they were all abandoned,” he says. In the glare of world publicity, the tests became a political hot potato for the British Museum. The sample used for the tests, Rolfe argues in his new film, was too small and taken from a corner where the shroud was likely to have been repaired over the centuries. Many would argue that, even if the shroud could be proved to be the burial cloth of the man named Jesus who was crucified 2,000 years ago, that doesn’t amount to proof of his resurrection, the central tenet of Christian belief. “The carbon dating could show it was definitely from the time of Christ, but it’s still a stretch to go from that to seeing it as proof that he rose from the dead,” says Richy Thompson of Humanists UK. “Some people believe that, yes, Jesus was a real person, and we know crucifixion was a thing in those times, and Pontius Pilate is a well-documented historical figure. “What many non-religious people would say is, where is the evidence? Because if you’re going to make extraordinary claims, you need strong evidence to back it up. And the fact that people believe [in the resurrection] is not in itself evidence that it actually happened.” Rolfe is unperturbed: he says the image on the cloth seems to have come from a massive burst of radiation, emitted in a fraction of a second. When it comes to the carbon dating, he’s certainly not alone in his scepticism. Barrie M Schwortz, a photographer who documented the shroud in 1978, says “murky” would be a good word to describe the events of 1988. “Today there are at least six peer-reviewed scientific articles that challenge the results of the carbon dating,” he says. In his view, the players involved were in a hurry to get the job done, because they wanted to get carbon dating on the map. “Those tests made it a household name, and today it’s used widely in archaeology,” he says. “I’m Jewish, so I don’t have a horse in this race, but I’ve come to believe it’s the authentic burial cloth because I’ve looked at the science.” The British Museum is less willing to get involved this time around. “Any current questions about the shroud would be best put to those who currently care for it in the royal chapel of the cathedral of Turin,” a spokesperson said.",News/World news,"The $1m challenge: ‘If the Turin Shroud is a forgery, show how it was done’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/the-1m-challenge-if-the-turin-shroud-is-a-forgery-show-how-it-was-done
4/17/2022,"Paul Graham visited Northern Ireland for the first time in 1984. “I was in my mid-20s and curious,” he says. “I wanted to see for myself what was happening there.” Travelling around the province in a rental car, he was immediately struck by the gentle beauty of the countryside, but also felt “a vague sense of fraughtness and unease” as he passed through villages bedecked with either union jacks or Irish tricolours. Graham had already made two acclaimed books of quietly observant documentary photography in the early 80s: A1 – The Great North Road, for which he travelled the entire length of the route, and Beyond Caring, which was shot in unemployment offices around the UK. The social landscape of Northern Ireland during the Troubles, though, was a different kind of challenge for a young photographer who, as he now puts it, “wanted to find out what was going on there in my name”. Graffiti, Ballysillan Estate, Belfast, 1986. In the countryside, his presence attracted curiosity from local people unused to seeing a stranger with a camera, who seemed to be taking pictures of fields, hills and deserted roads. On the territorial streets of Belfast and Derry, he understandably felt more anxious. “I was an English guy travelling alone and I didn’t have a press pass,” he says. “It was frustrating because I couldn’t just go and hang out in bars as I thought I’d be an object of suspicion. So, apart from meeting a few friends, I spent a lot of time on my own.” That sense of distance, physical and psychological, informs every image in his classic photo-book, Troubled Land, which is just about to be republished. Comprising determinedly elliptical landscape photographs he made on around a dozen trips to Northern Ireland between 1984 and 1986, it is a study in what might be called detached engagement. The opening image is indicative of his approach: a tall tree taken across an expanse of green field with a mountain in the background. It takes a moment to register the union jack fluttering atop the highest branches. The second seems even more mundane: a view of the border town of Strabane from a vantage point on an overgrown hill above a row of houses. One has to look really closely to pinpoint the gaggle of people passing on a street far below – marchers in a republican parade. Republican Parade, Strabane, 1986. Ironically, the most well-known image from the book is perhaps the least typical: an elevated view of the loyalist Ballysillan housing estate in Belfast, with the outline of Cave Hill visible in the background beneath glowering rain clouds. In the foreground, the word “BEWARE” is painted in bright orange capitals on a low wall. Here, Graham’s personal sense of “fraughtness and unease” is made palpable, the absence of people imbuing the sprawling landscape with an even more ominous aspect. The day after we speak, Graham emails me a press photograph he remembers from that time. It shows a bunch of youths in Belfast throwing stones at the army and behind them a line of British press photographers, all of them essentially taking the same picture. “I had that photo pinned to a wall in my studio as a constant reminder of what I did not want to do,” he tells me over the phone from New York, where he has lived since the 1990s. “I had to find a more elliptical approach. Subconsciously, when you work on a project, you find what is necessary and, in this instance, it was to start photographing from a distance and steadily move in closer.” So understated were the resulting images that, when the book was first published in 1987, a reviewer saw the resulting photographs as a kind of denial of the contested politics of place and identity that so defined Northern Ireland in the public consciousness. They are, in fact, visible throughout, hiding in plain sight. “You have to look closely to work out what is going on and where,” Graham says now. “Essentially, they are conflict photographs masquerading as landscape photographs.” ‘P.R.O.V.O.S.’ (Provisional IRA Graffiti), Newry, 1985. Back when Troubled Land first appeared in 1986, I remember being jolted by the deep familiarity of Graham’s almost ordinary landscapes: country roads bisecting well-tended fields beneath big, cloud-brushed skies; rainswept red-brick streets and sprawling suburban housing estates; mysterious biblical quotations – “Eternity Where” – painted on handmade wooden signs nailed to roadside trees. His images evoked a profound sense of the place I grew up in, all the more so because they eschewed the usual cliches of reportage: clamorous protests, riots, burning cars and bombed buildings. Thirty-five years after it was first published, that remains the case, many of his landscapes seeming both of their time and oddly timeless. In Northern Ireland, tribal flags and contesting political posters still proliferate and biblical verses still appear like warnings nailed to trees and posts along country roads. “I had all my preconceptions challenged almost from the moment I arrived there,” says Graham. “Nothing correlated to what I’d read or been told. The calm, distant overview was really the only path I could take.” It resonates still.

4/17/2022,"Boris Johnson beware. Ever since Britain first became a democracy in 1928, its prime ministers have been booted, or winkled, out of Downing Street rather than departing purely of their own free will. The only clear exception to the rule is Stanley Baldwin, who in 1937 announced his retirement, having won a massive majority two years earlier and then ridding the country of its scandal-ridden, pro-German monarch. Every one of Baldwin’s successors, apart from Harold Wilson, who might have been able to hang on longer had he not quit before illness and exhaustion overwhelmed him, has resigned after losing a general election (Churchill, Attlee, Home, Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Major and Brown) or losing the confidence, or at least testing the patience, of their parliamentary colleagues (Churchill, Eden, Thatcher, Blair, Cameron and May). Given, then, that ejection from within rather than from without is by no means uncommon, Johnson surely has cause for concern. Never as stunning as many imagine, his standing with the public is not only lower than it has ever been, it is lower than that enjoyed by many – indeed, quite possibly all – of his predecessors. The PM is not widely trusted. He’s not considered competent. He’s not even that well-liked anymore. And we would find pretty much the same were we to scientifically survey Tory MPs at Westminster. They will be compulsively reading polls that, as the cost of living crisis really begins to bite, show Labour moving into a sustained lead not just on voting intention but on some of the key issues that help decide elections. Website ConservativeHome’s invaluable temperature-taking of the party’s grassroots suggests they are considerably less impressed with Johnson than they used to be and considerably more impressed with many of his colleagues. Since so many of the underlying factors associated with a party getting shot of a prime minister would seem to be in play, one might have been forgiven for assuming that Johnson being issued with a fixed-penalty notice over partygate would have lit the blue touch paper. And yet. And yet. Nothing to see here. At the last count, around 80 Tory MPs had voiced their support for the PM, apparently seeing nothing wrong with him breaking the laws he himself had made and misleading parliament about doing so. So far, only three MPs have called on him, in terms, to go since news of him and his chancellor being fined broke last Tuesday, while the only member of the government to quit in protest sits in the Lords not the Commons. True, all that leaves well over 250 Tory MPs who have chosen to keep schtum, including many who, whether as junior ministers or lower-level bag-carriers, make up the “payroll vote” whose members are obliged to toe the party line. But anyone hoping that their silence is ominous, as opposed to simply spineless, is likely to be disappointed. The reasons for this, according to the majority of Westminster-watchers, are mainly circumstantial. But is that the whole story? We’re informed, for instance, that even the most jaded of Johnson’s colleagues are having second thoughts after seeing him strutting the world stage once more, with Ukraine providing the party in the media (the columnists and the editors of the Tory-supporting press) with the “Don’t they know there’s a war on?” logic for keeping him in place. Yet, as others have pointed out with reference to two world wars and one Gulf war, that spurious logic hasn’t stayed MPs’ hands before now. We’re also told that Rishi Sunak’s recent fall from grace, combined with lingering doubts about his keenest rival, Liz Truss, makes a leadership contest less likely since, the argument runs, there is no consensus as to who would take over. To which the obvious rejoinder is: when has such a consensus ever been required previously? If you’re stuck in a burning building with only one fire exit, you don’t wait to find out what’s on the other side before pushing open the door. Then there’s the argument that, especially now that we’re fretting about our household finances, partygate is old news. It’s even suggested that we’ve all spent so long discussing whether or not the police would eventually fine Johnson, his breaking the law is effectively “priced in”, just as so many of his other fibs, flaws and foibles have been over the years. The problem with this argument is that for every survey cited to claim that the public wants to “move on”, one can find another that shows they’re still very angry about the whole thing and, by a substantial majority, want the PM gone. And now there’s Rwanda. Apparently, only an out-and-out radical rightwing populist like Johnson could contemplate something so bold, all the more so if the liberal left falls headlong into such an obvious war-on-woke elephant trap. But is that the case? Take it from someone who’s spent far too long studying the issue: Tory governments have always stooped to conquer on immigration. It’s what they do. We need, then, to look beyond pure contingency at the deeper reasons – some rational, others less so – behind Conservative MPs hanging on to Johnson in spite of what polling, their consciences, and some of the braver souls on their own side, might be telling them otherwise. We could, for starters, look to “rational choice” approaches to politics. For example, one of those braver souls, the Tory peer Daniel Finkelstein, thinks Johnson should go but doubts he will, citing what he calls “a market failure in political coups” due to the fact that, although the majority of a party’s MPs might benefit from such a move, the costs, should it fail, are concentrated on the minority courageous enough to mount it. Another explanation rooted in rational choice would focus on the fact that Johnson, since he has few, if any, fixed opinions and is now severely weakened, is relatively easy to push and pull in whatever direction most suits his colleagues and the media. Planning reform that might actually see enough houses built where they’re most needed? No thanks. Additional measures to combat Covid? I don’t think so. Net zero? Not so fast. Spending enough to really sort out social care or the NHS backlog or the chronic shortfall in local authority finances or the grave blow dealt by the pandemic to children’s education? Forget about it. Any new leader, by contrast, would, by dint of being given a fresh mandate, be far less easy to manipulate. Then there’s the cognitive biases beloved of behavioural economists, in particular the sunk cost fallacy, which sees us carry on investing in projects (and people) into which we have already poured resources even when the possibility of a payback grows increasingly remote, a tendency exacerbated by the worry that giving the whole thing up as a bad job, especially if we’ve previously publicly defended our initial choice, would be tantamount to admitting we’ve been a bit of an idiot. Perhaps, though, the explanation is even more psychological? Gratitude to Johnson for helping the Tories win a big majority back in 2019 is one thing, but gratitude is normally one of the most perishable quantities in party politics. “What have you done for me lately?” is normally the question to which leaders need to provide a persuasive answer. And in any case, does that gratitude really entitle the PM to exploit and abuse his supporters’ trust time and time again? There is arguably, then, more than a whiff of co-dependency in the way that Johnson’s ministerial colleagues, by publicly defending him and prioritising his interests over their own dignity and conscience, effectively enable him to continue to behave in a manner that, from the outside anyway, would seem to be harmful to them. What’s more, keeping him there, whatever your politics, is surely trashing the idea that accountability needs to exist not only at elections but between them too. Ultimately, however, it seems to me that the ability of an utterly compromised prime minister to retain the confidence of his colleagues, in spite of his losing the support of the public and becoming a deadweight drag on his party’s popularity, must involve a degree of magical thinking. Indeed, I would argue that like Churchill and Thatcher before him, Johnson has become what we might call a talismanic leader, one who, possessed by powers that sometimes seem superhuman, even supernatural, to his friends and foes alike will, whatever the current evidence to the contrary, supposedly see their party through the very worst of times and into the sunlit uplands. A word of warning, however. As Churchill and Thatcher themselves learned the hard way, magic wears off. In an allusion that the prime minister himself may appreciate, talismanic amulets worn in Roman times occasionally bore the Latin inscription utere felix – “good luck to the user”. As we move towards local elections and a byelection in Wakefield, both of which could spell serious trouble for the Tories, Johnson and his parliamentary and media fan clubs are probably going to need it.

4/17/2022,"Cancer care relies on complex therapies involving radioactive materials and sophisticated drugs and has come far from past remedies based on plants and herbs. However, scientists warn there is still a need to understand the botanical roots of tumour treatments – to maintain new sources of drugs and to ensure plant resources are not overexploited. The natural world still has a lot to teach us about tackling disease. An example is provided by Melanie-Jayne Howes, a researcher based at Kew Gardens in London. “An effective anti-cancer drug called paclitaxel was developed from the Pacific yew tree. However, it was based on a chemical that exists in very low yields,” said Howes. “Hundreds of trees had to be cut down to develop the drug. As a result, the tree is now classified as near threatened.” However, a solution has been provided – by botanists. Howes said: “A similar drug has since been found in higher concentrations in the common yew and this is now used, with much less ecological harm, to make paclitaxel, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancers. Basic research and understanding of plant biology has had a key impact on cancer treatment.” This point was reiterated by Prof Susan Short of Leeds University. “There are lots of different tumour types and tumour subtypes that are being discovered all the time so we still need new ideas and new drugs,” she said. Short is leading an extensive UK trial of the cannabis-based medicine Sativex in order to treat patients with recurrent glioblastomas, an aggressive form of brain tumour. The trial will assess the impact of the drug – which is also used to treat multiple sclerosis and is delivered as an oral spray – on people undergoing standard chemotherapy. “We will be treating patients whose primary brain tumours have grown back after standard treatments, to see if adding this plant-based drug to subsequent chemotherapy helps to keep them alive for longer and to see if it improves their quality of life,” added Short. Plant-based treatments clearly have a vital role to play in cancer therapies, a point emphasised by Howes. “Even today, scientists have not been able to synthesise some drugs because they are so complex so we still rely on plants for key cancer drugs,” said Howes, whose work involves examining the plants and seeds found at Kew in order to pinpoint new drugs and medicines. As examples of past successes, she pointed to vinblastine and vincristine, two critically important drugs that are used to treat Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma and several other cancers. The only source of these medicines is from extracts of the rose periwinkle, which is native to Madagascar but grown across the world as an ornamental plant. “The periwinkle was used originally as a traditional treatment for diabetes but subsequent research showed it had potential anti-cancer properties,” said Howes. However the efficacy of plant extracts is not restricted to the creation of cancer drugs. Medicines for many other conditions are still isolated from plants and used today. Galantamine, an extract of snowdrops, is used to treat dementia, while artemisinin, an extract of the plant sweet wormwood – a herb used in Chinese traditional medicine – was shown by the chemist Tu Youyou to be effective in treating malaria, a discovery that won her a share of the 2015 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. The emphasis on the power of plants to help people survive disease for longer and have better quality of life has important consequences outside the treatment of their conditions, added Howes. “If we can show how we can source new medicines from nature by unlocking the useful properties of plants, then we help treat disease, but we also demonstrate the value of biodiversity and provide an incentive for people to protect it.”",News/Society,Plants hold key to developing future cancer treatments ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/17/plants-hold-key-to-developing-future-cancer-treatments
