5/17/2022,"Two high school seniors in Texas were found dead from a fentanyl overdose after suffering from drug addictions for years, according to investigators.

The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office deputies responded to a double overdose call at a home on Stanwick Place, The Woodlands. They found Irene Sunderland, 18, and her boyfriend Grant Blodgett, 17, dead ​​in a bedroom on May 5.

Mandy, Irene’s mother, found her daughter’s body in her bedroom surrounded by drugs on the day she was reportedly going to take her to rehab.

“An intervention person was at my house in the kitchen, and when she said it was time to wake up my daughter before she went to school to begin the intervention, with my letter and all that… my daughter was gone,” Sunderland told Click2Houston.

Investigators found phone records on both teenagers’ cellphones, leading to the arrest of 19-year-old dealer Abdulbaaith Abiodun Adewale. They found text messages from Adewale informing the couple that another person had already died from the same heroin he had given them. Authorities believe that Adewale knew the drugs “could and would likely kill them.”

Toxicology results confirmed the presence of fentanyl, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

Adewale was charged with two second-degree felony charges of manufacturing or delivering a controlled substance causing death or serious bodily injury. His bond was set at $150,000.

The 19-year-old was previously charged with three counts of possession of a controlled substance; however, the charges were dropped after he completed a program.

“This is an example of the recent law passed by the Texas Legislature that allows us to charge those who provide illegal narcotics that cause the death of our citizens,” Sheriff Rand Henderson said in a statement. “Let this be a warning to those who sell illicit narcotics: Montgomery County Law Enforcement is committed to finding you and holding you accountable not only for the selling of illicit narcotics but for the deaths that occur.”

Sunderland and Blodgett died just two weeks before their graduation at Woodlands High School. Sunderland, who was born in Changsha, China, in 2003, was adopted by Mandy and Jeffrey Sunderland. She was a member of her high school’s dance team, and she was planning to attend Drexel University to pursue fashion merchandising. Blodgett was a few weeks away from his 18th birthday on May 25. He played football and was planning to attend Texas Tech University to pursue History.

The Montgomery County District Attorney’s office will hold off on interviews until after both victims are laid to rest. Adewale’s arraignment date is expected for early next week.

5/17/2022,"A group of med school students is going viral after sharing how much debt the individuals be in when they graduate. The insight comes courtesy of a student named William (@will_ill), who often posts on TikTok about his life in med school. Many of Willam’s videos have gone viral before, but his latest post — about the debt he and his fellow students will face in a few short years — has drawn over 3 million views. Bitcoin ETFs: What are they and how to invest in them? His video is earning praise for its transparency but also leaving many users blown away by just how expensive med school can be. It’s also just the latest in a recent series of viral TikToks about everyday student issues. In one recent clip, a historian revealed why history degrees aren’t as “useless” as some students think. In another, several med school students shared how many times they had to apply to their programs. William’s video offered a similarly personal look at college life. “We’re so broke it’s actually insane,” the TikToker captioned his post. Many of William’s classmates were lighthearted and nonchalant when sharing their massive debt totals. That said, the amounts themselves were fairly jarring for viewers. The lowest amount given by any of William’s classmates was $150,000. Meanwhile, some said they would owe $300,000 or even $400,000 when they graduate. NBA and NFL star stylist Dex Robinson's must-haves for a night out with the fellas: Those numbers, it turns out, are fairly normal. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the median debt of a med school student in 2019 was $200,000. That high number is partly explained by the fact that the average public four-year medical school costs over $250,000 per student, while the average private school costs over $330,000. TikTokers couldn’t believe William’s video, or his classmates’ attitudes about their debt. “How are y’all so casual about it?” one user wrote. “I’d be in constant crippling anxiety if I even had debt.” “Med school should be free,” another argued. “Salaries have been totally squeezed and they have a massively delayed earnings start.” “Every day i remember again why i am so happy i decided not to stick with pre-med,” another wrote.

5/17/2022,"For 55-year-old Liang Shi, age is no limit as he took an entrance exam for the 26th time since he was a teenager to get into his dream school.

While many people have reportedly told Liang that his “failing memory” would hinder him from studying textbooks like his younger peers, he is determined to score high enough on the gaokao exam this year to attend Sichuan University, which he first missed out on in 1983.

He described himself as “still young” and reassured his critics that he has no issues with studying at his age.

“I just turned 55, and I’m still young. And I am having no trouble learning history and geography so far,” Liang said in a video posted to Weibo by Sino-Singapore.

The gaokao exam, which translates to “high exam,” is China’s annual standardized college entrance exam and is typically taken during the third and final year of high school. It is known for being notoriously difficult.

Liang had to skip the exam 14 times due to work and policies that required students to be unmarried and under the age of 25, which were later removed in 2001.

In June of last year, Liang received a score of 403 out of 750 while the minimum admission score to attend Sichuan University is 521. Despite failing for the 25th time, Liang persevered and began preparing for this year’s exam shortly after finishing last year’s as his “desire to attend college was strong.”

“I will continue to take the gaokao until it becomes obvious that my dream cannot be realized,” Liang said.

After failing the science portion of the exam for years, which is included for those who apply as science students, Liang decided to transfer as an art and human science student, as he believes it may be easier to prepare for.

Online users have nicknamed Liang as “gaokao Dingzihu,” which translates to “nail household,” in reference to people who never leave their home or give up despite numerous failures.

Liang currently owns a building materials company in Chengdu, the capital of southwest China’s Sichuan Province.

Similarly, in 2019, a 72-year-old Chinese man, Kang Lianxi, took the gaokao for the last time after failing it 19 times. Despite not receiving the score that he hoped for, Kang's determination motivated some young students to believe that it is never too late to achieve objectives and life goals.

5/17/2022,"PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Senate on Monday opened an ethics investigation into a firebrand Republican member who tweeted inflammatory comments about last weekend's racist attack at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket that left 10 people dead. The referral of Sen. Wendy Rogers of Flagstaff to the Ethics Committee was in lieu of the immediate expulsion that Democratic lawmakers were planning, GOP Majority Leader Rick Gray said. Due process considerations require no less than an ethics investigation, he said. But Democrats were furious, noting that Rogers was just censured in March for a repeated series of tweets and statements that embraced white nationalism and called for violence. Despite a bipartisan 24-3 vote on the Republican plan to open an ethics committee review that could lead to an expulsion, censure or reprimand, Democrats failed to get any Republicans to back their motion to expel Rogers. On Saturday, as news of the mass shooting by a white suspect who had posted a racist screed on the internet and driven about 200 miles (322 kilometers) to a primarily Black neighborhood in Buffalo, Rogers tweeted “Fed boy summer has started in Buffalo.” Many in both parties took that tweet to mean that Rogers was blaming the attack on the federal government, especially in light of Rogers' history of embracing conspiracy theories and posting of racist tropes. Republican leaders of the Senate tried to get in front of the controversy Monday morning, putting out a statement condemning the violence and “all hate speech that has served as an inspiration for these kinds of heinous crimes.” Without naming Rogers, the statement said “words have consequences, and while we believe in our first amendment rights of free speech, we denounce any and all extremist rhetoric that has fueled these horrendous acts.” Only three members voted not to open the ethics probe, including Rogers and Republican Sen. Warren Petersen, who said he hadn't even heard of the controversy when he walked onto the Senate floor. Republican Sen. Kelly Townsend, who is challenging Rogers in the GOP primary after redistricting put both in the same district, also opposed the ethics probe. Townsend said Rogers' comments were an embarrassment to the state and the Republican Party and added to the pain of the families of those killed in Buffalo. “But she has a right to make them,” Townsend said. “I have to defend a person's right to say ugly things. That's why the First Amendment exists. It doesn't exist for the kind words — it exists for the ugly words.” Rogers issued a statement after the vote slamming Democrats for what she said was an effort to divide Republicans, and said her now-deleted tweet was misinterpreted. “Sadly, my comment was taken completely out of context and became a false narrative that’s now the focal point of a firestorm created by certain race-obsessed members of the media,” Rogers statement said. The hours-long debate in the Senate over what to do about Rogers devolved into a fracas, with Republicans accusing Democrats of trying to make political hay and Democrats accusing GOP members of a pattern of dodging uncomfortable discussions about race relations by shutting down any debate on the issue. Republican Sen. Sonny Borrelli called it an example of cancel culture from Democrats who dislike Rogers and her brand of politics. Others agreed that Rogers' words were being used against her. “This is not an expellable offense,” Republican Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita said. “The Ds are politicizing it.” She called it a dangerous precedent to consider expelling or even censuring a member for their tweets or comments. GOP Sen. J.D. Mesnard, who was House speaker when a member was expelled in 2018 after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, said hearings and an ethics committee process were imperative. “This is the equivalent of a legislative execution,"" Mesnard said of the motion to expel Rogers. ""That’s why due process and an ethics process and investigation is so critical.” Democrats pointed to Rogers' previous problems, which started the month she was sworn into office in 2021 when a staffer accused her of bullying and other unprofessional conduct, and the March 2022 censure, which also was approved by a 24-3 vote with three members not present. Townsend was absent, but said she would have voted yes. “How many times do you allow your children to get out of hand before you provide the opportunity for discipline,” Democratic Sen. Theresa Hatathlie said. “Discipline is a teaching moment. That is something we have already had.” Democratic Sen. Martin Quezada said much the same, and accused GOP members of “kicking the can down the road,” by not taking immediate action. He said Rogers' tweets needed no investigation, and those and her history were all that was in play. “Now there’s a track record, now there’s a pattern of behavior,” Quezada said. “We haven’t heard any effort to defend those actions. And my assumption is because there is no defense to those actions."" Rogers made no comment on the floor of the Senate where the other members spent hours discussing her.",Politics/Associated Press,Arizona state senator slammed for Buffalo shooting comments,https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-state-senator-slammed-buffalo-003620444.html
5/17/2022,"By Natalia Zinets KYIV/NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine (Reuters) - Ukraine's military said on Tuesday it was working to evacuate all remaining troops from their last stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol, ceding control of the city to Russia after months of bombardment. The evacuation likely marked the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war and a significant defeat for Ukraine. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. With the rest of Mariupol firmly in Russian hands, hundreds of Ukrainian troops and civilians had holed up beneath the city's Azovstal steelworks. Civilians inside were evacuated in recent weeks, and more than 260 troops, some of them wounded, left the plant for Russian-controlled areas late on Monday. ""The 'Mariupol' garrison has fulfilled its combat mission,"" the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said in a statement announcing evacuations. ""The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel... Defenders of Mariupol are the heroes of our time,"" it added. Ukraine's deputy defence minister said 53 injured troops from the Azovstal steelworks were taken to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk, some 32 kilometres (20 miles) to the east. Another 211 people were taken to the town of Olenivka, in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatists, Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said. All of the evacuees will be subject to a potential prisoner exchange with Russia, she added. It was not clear how many troops remained in Azovstal. Ukraine's military said efforts were under way to evacuate those still inside. Reuters saw five buses carrying troops from Azovstal arrive in Novoazovsk late on Monday. Some of the evacuated troops were wounded and carried out of the buses on stretchers. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. ""We hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an early morning address. ""There are severely wounded ones among them. They're receiving care. Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive."" Arriving in Novoazovsk in a bus marked with Z, a symbol for Russia's invasion, men could be seen stacked on stretchers on three levels. They stared out the windows without reacting. One man was wheeled out, his head tightly wrapped in thick bandages. Since Russia launched its invasion in February, Mariupol's devastation has become a symbol both of Ukraine's resistance and of Russia's willingness to devastate Ukrainian cities that hold out. The first evacuations late on Monday came hours after Russia said it had agreed to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers to a medical facility in Novoazovsk. LVIV EXPLOSIONS, KHARKIV FIGHTING Moscow calls its nearly three-month-old invasion a ""special military operation"" to rid Ukraine of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war. Russia's invading forces have run into apparent setbacks, with troops forced out of the north and the environs of Kyiv in late March. A Ukrainian counterattack in recent days has driven Russian forces out of the area near Kharkiv, the biggest city in the east. Areas around Kyiv and the western city of Lviv, near the Polish border, have continued to come under Russian attack. A series of explosions struck Lviv early on Tuesday, a Reuters witness said. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage. On Monday, Ukraine's defence ministry troops had advanced all the way to the Russian border, about 40 km north of Kharkiv. The successes near Kharkiv could let Ukraine attack supply lines for Russia's main offensive, grinding on further south in the Donbas region, where Moscow has been launching mass assaults for a month yet achieving only small gains. PUTIN CLIMBDOWN OVER NATO Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared on Monday to climb down from threats to retaliate against Sweden and Finland for announcing plans to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. ""As far as expansion goes, including new members Finland and Sweden, Russia has no problems with these states - none. And so in this sense there is no immediate threat to Russia from an expansion to include these countries,"" Putin said. The comments appeared to mark a major shift in rhetoric, after years of casting NATO enlargement as a direct threat to Russia's security, including citing it as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine itself. Soon before Putin spoke, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Finland and Sweden were making a mistake that would have far-reaching consequences: ""They should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it."" Putin said NATO enlargement was being used by the United States in an ""aggressive"" way to aggravate an already difficult global security situation, and that Russia would respond if the alliance moves weapons or troops forward. ""The expansion of military infrastructure into this territory would certainly provoke our response. What that (response) will be - we will see what threats are created for us,"" Putin said. Finland and Sweden, both non-aligned throughout the Cold War, say they now want the protection offered by NATO's treaty, under which an attack on any member is an attack on all. ""We are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said, announcing plans to formally abandon militarily non-aligned status - a cornerstone of national identity for more than 200 years.

5/17/2022,"Twitter users expressed a divided opinion when it came to popular YouTuber Emma Chamberlain’s Met Gala, Cartier-designed diamond choker, which was is allegedly a piece of stolen jewelry by the British from India.

The necklace, lent to the vlogger for the event, reportedly disappeared from the Patiala royal treasury around 1948. Prior to that, it had belonged to Indian ruler Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala, one of the richest men in the world during his reign from 1900-1938.

In the center of the choker is a golf ball-sized, yellow 23.6 carat De Beers diamond, at one point the seventh-largest in the world. With an additional 2,930 diamonds, the necklace has a total carat weight of over 1,000.

The necklace reportedly resurfaced at a London store in 1998, where French luxury brand Cartier, which specializes in high-end jewelry, then acquired it.

Netizens commented throughout the week about the necklace, which Chamberlain, who has over 11.4 million YouTube subscribers, had worn to the Met Gala on May 2.

“Okay so nobody is gonna talk about Emma chamberlain wearing literally a necklace worn by a south Asian king at the met gala? When it comes to south Asians it’s always ignored and rejected SPEAK ABOUT THIS,” commented one user with the hashtag #culturalappropriation.

“This fills me up with rage, this level of disrespect is unacceptable,” wrote another user.

Others were not so impressed, arguing that Chamberlain was not to blame.

“Plz why did I just see someone say they think Emma Chamberlain should have kept the Maharaj's necklace and delivered it back to India... as if she had that much power.”

Some simply did not find the situation problematic, with multiple netizens claiming that “nobody cares.”

S. Vijay Kumar, founder of the India Pride Project, a citizens’ platform that traces India’s lost treasures, explained the difficulty of asserting ownership over stolen antiques.

He listed the Koh-i-Noor and Golconda Orlov diamond as other examples of smuggled jewels that have found their way to other countries, including the latter which is currently located in the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia.

“It’s a pity that India doesn’t assert its weight in seeking to stop the open auction and display of its plundered treasures,” he added.

Ambiguity in international laws make it nearly impossible to obtain stolen items, especially considering that many of them have no documentation that would make it possible to trace back their ownership history.

5/17/2022,"Donald Trump is reposting his Truth Social messages with a new profile on Twitter. (Photo: Brandon Bell via Getty Images) Former President Donald Trump is back on Twitter. He’s reposting all of his messages from his own operation, Truth Social, under the new Twitter profile “President Donald J. Trump’s Truth Social Posts.” The description for the account @PresTrumpTS adds: “President Donald J. Trump’s Truth Social Posts on Twitter — Making sure President Trump is heard on Twitter while he and Devin Nunes focus on Truth Social.” The tweets available Monday included 210 messages Trump has posted on Truth Social since February, which are now also clearly tailored to Twitter. Each tweet pleads: “Please Follow and Retweet.” (Photo: Screen Shot/Twitter) The new account is only for Trump’s messages on Truth Social and others he has chosen to “retruth.” In tweets Monday, he bashed Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and spoke up for beleaguered reelection candidate Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R- N.C.) He also reposted yet another image of himself as a pompous “MAGA king.” #PresidentTrump#TruthSocial#Truth#ElonMusk#Twitter Please Follow and Retweet @PresTrumpTSpic.twitter.com/DcOmcsW0fh — Donald J Trump’s Truth Social Posts (@PresTrumpTS) May 16, 2022 Trump was permanently banned from Twitter in 2021 for his role in last year’s attack on the U.S. Capitol. Potential new Twitter owner Elon Musk has indicated he would let Trump back on the platform, but it’s uncertain if Musk will finalize the purchase deal. Twitter has a policy prohibiting banned users from dodging restrictions by utilizing other profiles to post messages. But Trump routinely defies the policy by posting messages on the Twitter account of his paid aide Liz Harrington. Now he has two places to dodge his ban. Twitter did not return a request for comment from HuffPost about Trump’s latest work-around. The new setup on Twitter appears to already undermine the spirit of Trump’s own pledge in a filing Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that “if” he’s allowed back on Twitter he will partially restrict usage and prioritize Truth Social (and give some comfort to investors). He promised to wait six hours before posting a Truth Social message on competing social media, but only if it doesn’t involve politics. All of Trump’s Truth Social tweets could be construed as political. “President Donald J. Trump’s Truth Social Posts” joined Twitter in April, according to its profile description. Several responses to the profile, however, indicate it’s brand new. HuffPost first spotted it Sunday. There were close to 2,200 followers on Monday. Several critics called for Trump’s new account to be reported as violating the platform’s policy prohibiting banned users from evading restrictions.
