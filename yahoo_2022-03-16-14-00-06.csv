3/16/2022,"What's a tactical nuclear bomb? It is — drumroll please — a nuclear bomb. But please don't worry; they're small ones. Some are ""only"" the size of the weapons that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Some are smaller than that. Some are so small they can be launched as artillery shells. Some can be dropped by airplanes or put on the tips of short(ish)-range missiles. Some tactical nukes could even be carried on your back, though it probably wouldn't be good for you. There's been a fair amount of conversation online about the ""tactical weapons gap."" The United States has 230 of these smaller nukes, with reports that around 100 of those are in Europe. Russia has as many 2,000, most already in the European theater, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has seemed to indicate a willingness to use them, most likely if he felt himself to be losing in Ukraine, or if NATO joined the fight. So, what would this gap really mean? Would it be decisive in a war? No. ""If we were to unleash a couple of hundred versus a couple of thousand [tactical nukes] it would be a distinction without a difference,"" Retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Robert Latiff told The Week. The sheer destructive power of each side renders the details significantly irrelevant. Tit for tat, by the time the U.S. is outgunned, we're at 460 nukes launched. It's enough to destroy every tank in this war. It's certainly enough to kill millions of civilians. The Russians could keep going from there, but now we're into madness land. And having run out of the little nukes, and afraid of losing, would we really stop without resorting to one — just one — strategic bomb? If that happens, a war like we've seen before becomes a war unlike anything we've ever seen before. A tactical nuclear strike has taken us into an unwinnable strategic nuclear war. The truth is no one is sure what would happen if even one of these tactical nuclear bombs were used in war. According to Latiff, the international reaction would differ if it happened in Ukraine itself or, say, in Poland. But the only people who really know how escalation would work aren't telling. The strategy for reacting to a small nuclear provocation is top secret, Latiff said. Does that uncertainty make it more likely or less Putin would use one of these bombs? He may bank on a sub-nuclear NATO reaction. Or he may hold back because he can't bank on that. There are a lot of generals paid to think about these things. All the world can do is hope they're thinking clearly.

3/16/2022,"Since Russia invaded Ukraine last month, China has insisted on remaining “neutral.” Yet that balancing act—which seems premised on Beijing’s hope of avoiding repercussions while maximizing the political and economic benefits it enjoys from continued relations with Russia, Europe, and the US—appears increasingly precarious. DoorDash wants to return your packages for you As US national security advisor Jake Sullivan meets today with China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Rome to discuss the Russia-Ukraine war, the US will be scrutinizing whether Beijing provides any economic or material support to Moscow. To be clear, it’s hard to take Beijing’s claims of neutrality seriously. At the very least, its stance is closer to what former White House Asia policy advisor Evan Medeiros calls “pro-Russia neutrality.” Can you refuse to return to the office? For one, Chinese president Xi Jinping has held a phone call with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to discuss the war, but not with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Meanwhile, Chinese state media has largely refrained from calling Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine a war, and in some cases even parroted the Kremlin phrase “special military operation.” And Chinese propaganda outlets have backed Russia’s false claims that the US is funding a bio-weapons program in Ukraine. Hu Wei, vice-chairman of the Public Policy Research Center, which sits under an advisory agency to China’s state council, argues in an essay penned earlier this month that China must “give up being neutral” and “avoid playing both sides in the same boat.” While China has made clear that its relationship with Russia has “no limits,” Beijing will only stand to gain from casting its lot with Moscow if the latter manages to defeat Ukraine and withstand western economic sanctions, Hu argues. And so far, in his assessment, that looks unlikely. “China cannot be tied to Putin and needs to be cut off as soon as possible…Being in the same boat with Putin will impact China should he lose power,” Hu writes, adding that Beijing’s failure to “proactively” respond to Russia’s aggression will invite “further containment from the US and the West.” In fact, China’s current “neutrality” is a lose-lose proposition, Hu argues: “…this position does not meet Russia’s needs, and it has infuriated Ukraine and its supporters as well as sympathizers, putting China on the wrong side of much of the world. In some cases, apparent neutrality is a sensible choice, but it does not apply to this war, where China has nothing to gain.” Wang Huiyao, president of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization, also sees strategic disadvantages to China of a long drawn-out war in Ukraine. “The longer the war lasts, the more it will reinvigorate the Western alliance around the idea of a values-based confrontation between East and West, bringing the United States and the European Union into even closer alignment…That is not good for China,” Wang writes in an op-ed published in the New York Times. Still, it’s unclear how much influence arguments like Hu’s and Wang’s will have on the officials making final policy decisions. According to the internet monitoring group GreatFire, Hu’s original Chinese-language essay has been censored on WeChat, and the website hosting its English-language translation is blocked.

3/16/2022,"That Starbucks paper cup could soon be a thing of the past – or it could be more expensive – as the coffee giant explores reusable options. Starbucks is “shifting away from single-use plastics and piloting reusable cup programs” in six markets, according to a Tuesday statement from the company. By the end of next year, customers will be allowed to use their own reusable cups in every store location in the United States and Canada. And by 2025, the company hopes to give “customers easy access to a personal or Starbucks provided reusable to-go cup for every visit,” the company said Tuesday. Starbucks, which has a goal of reducing waste by 50% by 2030, on Tuesday also said it is testing multiple programs for cutting down on single-use cups in stores around the world.

There's a new way to cut it. Those include allowing customers to borrow a reusable cup “designed to be returned to stores” and eliminating single-use cups, among other options. Some programs could involve paying a deposit for a cup customers will return after they use. The coffee mainstay is also looking into other incentives, including a 10 cent single-use fee or a 50 cent discount to customers who bring in their own reusable cups. Starbucks already offers a 10 cent discount to customers who provide their own cups. Disposable lids and cups produce 40% of Starbucks’s packaging waste, CNBC reported. Starbucks set a goal in 2008 to have one-quarter of customers use reusable cups by 2015, though the company did not reach the target. Last year, Starbucks announced the launch of a “Borrow A Cup” trial program in five stores in Seattle, allowing customers to order their beverage in a reusable cup for a $1 deposit. When they returned the cups, customers got the $1 back as well as rewards points through Starbucks’ loyalty programs. Reusable cups are at the center of one of Starbucks' most popular annual promotions, Red Cup Day when the chain gives away free holiday cups each November. Starbucks has increased its prices in recent months. Additional price increases are also planned for this year. What's everyone talking about?

3/16/2022,"By Tim Kelly TOKYO (Reuters) - In a sign of deepening military cooperation between Japan and the United States, amphibious Japanese troops and U.S. Marines on Tuesday practised airborne landing assaults together for the first time. Japan is revising a decade-old national security strategy this year in the face of China's growing military assertiveness. The upgrade to defence policy guidelines is expected to call for the country to take a more active role alongside Washington in regional security. The drills in the foothills of Mount Fuji on Tuesday involved 400 troops from Japan's Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade (ARDB), and 600 U.S. marines, and is part of a three-week joint exercise to hone interoperability between the allies. Tilt-rotor Osprey troop carriers were used during the drills. ""The real significance from this training is that the Marines and the ARDB are doing serious combat training of a sort that would have been unthinkable a decade ago,"" said Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel who advised Japan as a liaison officer when it set up its amphibious force. ""It demonstrates a more solidly linked U.S. and Japan."" Activated in 2018, the ARDB troops are Japan's first marines since World War Two and were formed to reinforce its defence along its southwest islands at the edge of the East China Sea. Trained to take back captured islands using helicopters, Ospreys and amphibious landing craft, the force of around 1,500 soldiers would likely be one of the first in action to counter any Chinese attack on Japan's islands. China, which is locked in a territorial dispute with Japan over uninhabited islands controlled by Tokyo in the East China Sea, routinely dispatches ships to assert its claims. The joint drills also come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine raises fresh security concerns in East Asia where China is putting pressure on Taiwan following its crackdown on Hong Kong. Japan also faces Russia's forces operating from Far East bases that are increasingly cooperating with China's military. Moscow describes its military action in Ukraine as a ""special operation"".
