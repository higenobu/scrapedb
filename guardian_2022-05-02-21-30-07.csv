5/2/2022,"The super-agent Pini Zahavi has been suspended from acting as a player intermediary for two months after a Football Association investigation. Zahavi, 78, was found to have misrepresented his actions during the transfer of the Israel international Beram Kayal from Celtic to Brighton in 2015. An FA regulatory commission found in February that Zahavi, who had said he was solely representing the interests of Brighton in the transfer, was also working on behalf of Kayal, and that his failure to reveal this dual interest meant a failure to pay the appropriate tax on the transfer. During an investigation Zahavi admitted to the dual representation and the commission accepted in mitigation that the agent had no previous disciplinary record. But the size of the fees involved – calculated at £70,000 – were considered sufficient to merit a strong sanction. Zahavi was banned for three months but appealed against the decision, with his lawyer Nick De Marco QC arguing that the commission had wrongly claimed Zahavi had previously acted for Kayal and that the punishment was out of sync with other similar offences. An appeal board accepted these arguments but rejected another claim that Zahavi had unwittingly made a false statement. As a result of the appeal, the sanction was reduced to two months, starting from 4 March, with Zahavi not allowed to undertake any of the functions of an intermediary during that time. He was also made to pay a fine of £5,000. Zahavi is one of the world’s most renowned agents, representing Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, RB Leipzig’s Christopher Nkunku and Tottenham’s Pierre-Emile Højbjerg among others.",Sport/Football,Agent Pini Zahavi banned for two months by FA over false declaration ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/agent-pini-zahavi-fa-ban-false-declaration
5/2/2022,"The Conservative MP Crispin Blunt has announced he will stand down at the next general election. In a statement posted on his website, he said that after “seven increasingly tumultuous parliaments, this will be my last”. Blunt, 61, has been the MP for Reigate since 1997 and has served as a justice minister and as chair of the foreign affairs select committee. The announcement comes weeks after Blunt drew criticism for defending his friend and fellow Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan after his conviction for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. After the conviction, which resulted in Khan being expelled from the Conservative party, Blunt posted a statement calling it a “dreadful miscarriage of justice” and “nothing short of an international scandal”. He later withdrew the comments and apologised, saying he did not “condone any form of abuse” and strongly believed in the “independence and integrity of the justice system”. Khan’s legal team has said he intends to appeal against the conviction. Blunt announced his decision to stand down in a post marking the 25th anniversary of his election as an MP. “This statement is not the place for the tale of the ensuing 25 years, that may or may not follow when this particular parliamentary journey is concluded,” he said. “But its purpose is to use this 25th anniversary to make public, what those closest to me have known privately for some time, that after seven increasingly tumultuous parliaments, this will be my last. “In looking forward to the next two years or so of this parliament, whilst securing my re-election is no longer an interest, there will be continued joy in representing the citizens I’ve had the honour to serve for 25 years.” He said he would also use the rest of his time in parliament to “help secure the future” of the Conservative party and to “continue to call out long established populist views on policy shibboleths that continue to cause damage to our society and beyond”. The Reigate constituency, situated in Surrey, is a longtime safe Tory seat, with Blunt winning a majority of more than 18,000 votes at the 2019 election.",News/Politics,Conservative MP Crispin Blunt to step down at next election,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/conservative-mp-crispin-blunt-to-step-down-at-next-election
5/2/2022,"Denmark is facing fresh claims of racism after MPs changed the country’s controversial anti-ghetto law to allow Ukrainian refugees to move into social housing emptied of “non-westerners”. For three years, the government has sought to restrict immigrants from moving into what are described as disadvantaged neighbourhoods in an attempt to avoid so-called “parallel societies”. Access to social housing, some of which has been earmarked for demolition, has been shut off to “non-westerners”, defined as being people from outside the EU, eight associated European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. People born in Denmark but who have a single “non-western” parent have also been included in the category of people subject to the restrictions. However, after the Danish government’s decision to take in 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, a majority of the Danish parliament voted on Thursday to amend the law to exempt Ukrainians from such restrictions. Plans to demolish social housing in the targeted areas have also been put on hold to free up accommodation for Ukrainians. Susheela Math, a litigation officer at the Justice Initiative, a campaign group against forced evictions in the so-called ghettos, said the law change proved the parallel society law was racially discriminatory. She said: “The laws underlying the evictions of tenants living in ‘vulnerable housing areas’ and the state’s volte-face on measures such as demolitions and housing allocations, show that the ‘ghetto package’ was clearly meant to target non-white individuals. “These discriminatory measures do not serve any public good and clearly exacerbate the shortage of affordable housing in Denmark. Many of the racialised residents being evicted are Danish and identify strongly with their Danish identity, having been born in or lived in these so-called ghetto areas for years. “These neighbourhoods are their homes. Some of these individuals were refugees themselves and have fled conflict and persecution – no differently than Ukrainians now fleeing war. The discriminatory treatment that they have been subjected to stands in stark contrast to the rightfully compassionate welcome that Ukrainian refugees have received in Denmark.” The anti-ghetto law was first proposed in March 2018 by the Liberal minority government, which introduced the political plan “One Denmark without parallel societies – no ghettos by 2030” and enacted the concept of “non-western” in Danish law. The Social Democratic prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has continued the policy since coming to power in June 2019 although the word ghetto has been removed from the latest legislation. The neighbourhoods targeted have more than 1,000 residents and more than half of residents are of “non-western” origin. They must also meet two of four criteria: more than 40% of residents are unemployed; more than 60% of 39- to 50-year-olds have no upper secondary education; crime rates are three times higher than the national average; and residents have a gross income 55% lower than the regional average. Twelve neighbourhoods currently fall into that category. In these areas, misdemeanours also carry double the legal penalties in place elsewhere and daycare is mandatory for all children over the age of one, or family allowances are withdrawn. Majken Felle, a resident of Mjølnerparken, a neighbourhood designated as a “ghetto” area, said she was convinced the parallel societies policy was driven by bigotry. She said: “Recently, a representative from Bo-Vita, the organization responsible for the redevelopment of Mjølnerparken, said in an interview that in neighbourhoods like mine, there is an Arab mentality and residents do not care about western culture, making these areas feel potentially unsafe to Ukrainian refugees. “He is saying out loud what is the unspoken intention behind the permanent removal of homes in ‘ghetto’ areas: that these policies and demolition projects are driven by racial prejudice.” According to Statistics Denmark, 11% of Denmark’s 5.8 million inhabitants are of foreign origin, of whom 58% are from a country considered “non-western”.",News/World news,Denmark accused of racism after anti-ghetto law adapted for Ukrainians,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/denmark-accused-racism-anti-ghetto-law-ukraine-refugees
5/2/2022,"‘Iam in blood,” said Macbeth, “Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more, / Returning were as tedious as go o’er.” In Ozark, Wendy and Marty Byrde are equally deep in blood. Indeed, the current and final season began late last year with the couple in the bathroom of a Mexican drug baron’s pretentious estate washing blood spatter they caught in their faces when the cartel’s lawyer (played by Janet McTeer) was terminated for doublecrossing them. Which, as anyone can tell you, is always a mistake. But what makes Ozark compelling right to its bitter end is that the Byrdes rage furiously against their fate in a way that Macbeth does not. Popular culture in general, and crime dramas in particular, are littered with corrupted, blood-spattered souls who look into the abyss and imagine they are exceptions and that it will not consume them. Wendy and Marty imagine they have the business savvy and people skills to pull off what he could not. They plan to reverse (in their family people carrier) out of Ozark’s sea of blood, rinse off the damned spots, return to Chicago and pass themselves off as an apple-pie American family unsullied by crime. Their non-profit Byrde Family Foundation, swollen with drug money, will help them in this rebranding, and through it they plan to bankroll good causes such as, with bitter irony, rehab centres for heroin addicts. Even though the Byrdes – Marty played by Jason Bateman as a man all but emotionally lobotomised, Wendy played by Laura Linney as a woman unremittingly self-deluded and no less ruthless – are among the most evil couple since Birnam wood moved to Dunsinane hill. Four seasons ago, Marty, a numbers guy with a flexitarian moral conscience, who had spent his career helping clients salt their ill-gotten gains away from the prying eyes of the IRS, and Wendy, a former political aide with a heart of permafrost, left Chicago for a resort in the Ozarks when things got too hot for them in the windy city. They took their children, Charlotte and Jonah, with them, effectively pushing their offsprings’ heads deeper into a world of secrets, lies and ancillary corpses. Which is not a move in any parenting manual you should read. Once in the idyllic lakeside home – and, for all its depiction of the region as a hub of human venality, Ozark has probably given this bucolic land a real-estate bump – the Byrdes spend four seasons trying to outfox the Feds by laundering drug money through a bar and strip club, and ultimately a floating casino. Their main customer becomes Omar Navarro, head of a cartel who, like them, dreams of achieving the impossible, namely going straight. And, if the Byrdes can’t help him in realising this, they’ll be doing more than wiping somebody else’s blood off their faces, if you catch my drift. All this would be enough for four series of thrilling drama, but there is more. The Byrdes and the cartel suppose Ozark’s locals to be biddable yokels, that Wyatt and Ruth Langmore are mere trailer trash and that bonkers poppy farmer and heroin producer Darlene Snell is just a hillbilly rube two shells short of a loaded shotgun. But those class prejudices are unfounded. The development of the character of Ruth Langmore – foul-mouthed, pint-sized moral conscience-cum-business whiz – proves otherwise. If you’ve enjoyed Julia Garner’s performances as Russian-born German fraudster Anna (Sorokin) Delvey in Inventing Anna, or as the titular foil to a Harvey Weinstein-like sex predator in The Assistant, stop everything you’re doing and watch her as Ruth right now. For me, there are just a handful of episodes left. Though Netflix’s business model is predicated, like the Mexican cartel, on hooking you quick and keeping you in a state of lucrative dependence, I’m refusing to binge watch to the finale. No doubt many gorged on the last tranche of episodes as soon as they dropped on Friday, and now have closure. But that’s no way to consume some of the most rewarding TV around. In the new episode I’ve just seen (the first from the final tranche), Ruth – hard as nails and brittle as pressed flowers – is driving to Chicago to settle the hash of the Navarro nephew, who offed her cousin Wyatt, and Darlene for getting in the way of the cartel’s business model. While, in general, I’m opposed to murder, never has anyone so deserved to be offed as the oleaginous cartel pretender Javi Elizonndro. As Ruth rolls into Illinois, she slips Nas’s 1994 album Illmatic into the CD player. As Nas raps his way through NY State of Mind, I realise why the episode is called Sleep Is the Cousin of Death. “I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death,” raps Nas, a line borrowed from Jacobean statesman and poet Thomas Sackville by way of Nightmare on Elm Street 3. In this nocturnal episode, no one sleeps, not only for fear of Hamlet-like bad dreams but because the life of crime requires 24/7 vigilance. Ruth pitches up at an all-night diner and finds herself chatting to real-life hip-hop star Killer Mike. After paying her respects, she asks now middle-aged Mike whether Nas would have thought his tough earlier years in the projects worth enduring because they supplied the raw material for his beautiful record. “It always feels to me like he hates it and misses it all at once,” says Ruth. “And he’s only fucking 20!” Mike replies. A young, supposedly white-trash woman from the middle of nowhere USA, we are to suppose, feels a deep connection with a black rapper with a headful of rage. It’s a beat-perfect scene that ends as the sun rises on a fateful day in which Ruth, one of very few sympathetic characters in Ozark, gets ready to avenge her beloved cousin’s murder. “Please come home,” pleads Three, her and Wyatt’s cousin, before she goes on her mission. “Wyatt would have hated you doing this.” But she doesn’t. Like Macbeth only more so, she’s in too deep.",Arts/Television & radio,"Farewell to Ozark – the most thrilling, rewarding crime show around",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/ozark-farewell-crime-show-laura-linney-jason-bateman-byrdes-ruth

I’m sorry the wrong note about Chambers was used below the grid, suggesting that some misprints were involved in the puzzle. As I think most of you realised, this was mistakenly copied from the previous competition puzzle. Tiresome, nevertheless. DESIDERATA proved a popular clue word, though tricky to deal with imaginatively. Quite a few submissions indicated singular usage, but I decided that it could probably be used to refer to a singular collection of things desired (though probably not as the subject of a singular verb, as ‘data’ often is). I was not familiar with the poem Desiderata by the American Max Ehrmann, though from your comments I learn that it is commonly quoted (eg. on cards, tea towels and suchlike). Most of you who expressed a view clearly regard it as rather trite, and having Googled it in full I’m inclined to agree. The poem apparently only became famous after Ehrmann’s death (in 1945). I was sad to learn of the recent death of (Dr) Eddie Young, for many years a regular Ximenes and Azed solver and competitor. He was educated at Christ’s Hospital School, where Ximenes and my wife’s father (Noel Sergent, whom I never knew) both taught, and was a keen X/AZ competitor for many years. He apparently took special delight in his 1st prize-winning clue for ROUGH-AND-READY in 1981: ‘A hard tussle with Dr E Young plainly winning?’, taking advantage of one of those coincidences that so rarely occur.

5/2/2022,"Ten Percent, the English language remake of French smash hit Call My Agent!, premiered on Prime Video this week after months of anticipation. Taking its cue from the original, it’s full of storylines about agents dealing with needy, fragile and often narcissistic clients, as well as cameos from the likes of Helena Bonham Carter, Dominic West, Himesh Patel and David Harewood. Though much of the plot remains the same, the quirky French mannerisms are replaced with a stuffy British way of doing things. “If Ten Percent seems, on occasion, too deferential to the showbiz world, this is its luvviest concession,” a Guardian review said. But the show stays true to what made Call My Agent so successful – the depiction of that unique relationship between agent and client. We see the agents treading the fine line with the stars, sometimes having to lie or massage their egos to persuade them into deals – and sometimes out of them. Whether it’s talking them through a facelift or giving relationship advice, they’re invariably drawn into their clients’ personal lives. On top of that, they have to compete with each other for the most lucrative contracts and the most sought-after clients, turning the office into a sink-or-swim environment full of backstabbing, corporate incompetence and misjudged love affairs. So is it really true to life? We asked a former agent’s assistant and talent manager at a British talent agency what it’s really like to be an agent to the stars. Everyone in my office who I spoke to and agents that I admired and got on with who watched the show found it very funny and related to it a lot. The themes of it are very on point. The show captured the sense of what those relationships between agent and client are like and how toxic they can become because of the lack of regulation, the power dynamics and the strange egos that coexist within our strange world of celebrity. High-profile clients exist in an ecosystem where no one ever tells them they’re wrong. When an actor, director or writer is at the early stages of their career they need the agent. But as soon as they get to earning-money level, whether that’s Hollywood or just British TV, you often don’t have contracts with them. You essentially just have an unwritten agreement that you’re working together. So at any time they can leave. Some of the clients we were working with would be worth £400,000 a year in commission to the company, maybe more. If they walk out, that’s a catastrophic loss to your business. There’s a huge culture of just going: ‘Oh yeah, absolutely, you are just amazing’ at all times. It becomes a juggling act. Rather than telling people what they need to hear, agents are just afraid of them leaving. On the team I was on, a third of our clients – around 10 to 20 – were offer only. That means they would never audition, they would only get offers. It’s Hollywood level. Not only does that client’s team and everyone around them constantly protect them and fight their side no matter what, but everyone on set treats them like a god. And then every time they go into the street as a recognisable face, people run up to them as if they’re a god too. So they have this kind of distorted reality. They’re removed from what it means to exist in our society. A lot of them could be very charming, but then you’d see how they interact with a waiter or a secretary, and you realise they don’t know how to talk to normal people because of their inflated sense of self. One of the things that that’s quite interesting is the degree of anxiety, that expectations versus happiness thing. A lot of the stars aren’t actually that happy. They’re constantly comparing themselves to each other. Why did they get that big role? Why is he better than me? It’s a real seesaw of emotion with some of them, particularly the ones that aren’t very prudent with money, which actually is quite a few of them. They need that reassurance and support and can often be quite childlike or childish in how they’ll respond to any form of rejection. There’s no regulation in the industry. My agency was big enough that they were close to having formalised processes and HR, but even then it was a lawless place with regards to how people spoke to each other. It would probably be considered illegal. Some messages from clients made you shake your head. In America, it’s ramped up even more. Every time a film comes in, it was ‘the most amazing script I’ve ever read’, ‘the most amazing actor who’s ever lived’. That was the narrative the American agents peddled to all the clients, which was quite insufferable. Competition between agents at my agency wasn’t that bad, but it can definitely be the case. Two agents can end up meeting the same client. You can agree to meet them together, but I imagine at the biggest agencies, where they don’t all know each other, there’s more of that.",Arts/Television & radio,‘It’s a lawless place’: working in the real life Ten Percent ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/ten-percent-agent-to-stars-on-talent-agency-world
5/2/2022,"Iranian actor-director Niki Karimi has created a very involved film, clotted with anger and pain, straining towards some emotional meaning or resolution which, for me, never satisfyingly emerges. She has co-written it with the film’s leading man, Hadi Hejazifar who with unsmiling intensity plays Kazem, a respected architect bearing the honorific “atabai”, (meaning roughly “great man”). Kazem returns to his home village near Iran’s Lake Urmia (an important tourist attraction) after some time away, and his homecoming opens old wounds within him. This home village was where his sister took her own life, after abuse from the man to whom she was forced into marriage by their cruel father, while secretly in love with Kazem’s best friend, whom Kazem now despises for not fighting for her. Now Kazem finds that his sister’s hated husband has cynically sold the beautiful orchard which was part of the dowry he received, to cover his debts. But the man who has bought it has two daughters – and Kazem finds himself falling in love with one of them. This is a curious film: acted and directed with great sincerity, impeccable formal control, an obvious feel for the landscape – and interesting use of voiceover, unusual in Iranian cinema. Yet the central narrative element of Kazem falling in love, and another woman falling in love with him, feels underdramatised and unconvincing. It’s clearly something that comes from a personal place in the hearts of its co-writers, but it leaves you wondering about the actual story or stories that inspired it.

5/2/2022,"Huw Thomas, a 70-year-old retired police officer from Bridgend, has backed the Conservatives his whole life. But not this week. “I’m voting Labour for the first time ever,” he said. “Every time I see Boris the buffoon, it makes me more sure. He’s lied and lied. He expressed shock that parties took place at Downing Street, then it turns out he was there. He’s laughing at us. That’s it for me.” It is the sort of view that cheers Labour activists in south Wales, for whom Bridgend county borough council is a key target in this week’s local elections. In 2017, the party lost more than 100 councillors across Wales and overall control of what were once seen as strongholds such as Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent. To make matters worse, Labour lost Bridgend to the Tories in the 2019 parliamentary election. This time they are determined to claw the losses back. The leader of the Labour group in Bridgend, Huw David, was to be found knocking on doors in Brackla, a sprawling housing estate to the east of the town centre built on a former second world war ordnance site. “This estate is where elections are won and lost,” he said. “It swings between Labour and the Tories.” Last time the Conservatives won three of the four Brackla council seats. “But we’re seeing people coming back to Labour in their droves.” Issues on the doorstep range from the very local: the bins, play areas, parking, to the national: the cost of living crisis (one resident came to the door wearing three jumpers because he could not afford to turn the heating on), and Partygate. Labour workers are keen to point out the contrast between the UK prime minister and the Welsh Labour first minister, Mark Drakeford, who isolated from his family in a garden shed at the height of Covid. “The prime minister has lost so much credibility with so many people,” said David. “Mark has shown careful, cautious leadership.” Tom Giffard, a Tory Senedd member for South Wales West, accepted that national issues – and the UK leadership – came up on the doorstep. “Boris Johnson has his fans – what you see is what you get, warts and all,” he said. “But this is a local election. Boris Johnson is not on the ballot paper. My impression is that good candidates that have been active are insulated from what is going on nationally.” All 22 councils in Wales are holding elections on 5 May. Laura McAllister, a professor of public policy at Cardiff University, said the competition between Labour and the Conservatives was intense. “I don’t think we’ll get back to the 2012 picture when Labour had basically half of all 1,200 councillors in Wales but you would expect them to make gains and even win back majority control in some areas,” she said. “The Tories are in the middle of a furore. It’s worth remembering too that last time the Tories picked up councillors from Ukip’s wipeout.” McAllister said Plaid Cymru, the third biggest party in the Welsh parliament, would look to consolidate its natural base in heartland areas such as Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. “But can it make progress in other valleys councils such as Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly? In Cardiff, Plaid and the Greens have come together under the common ground alliance. They may make gains in the odd ward there.” The Lib Dems, who have only one Senedd member, will be hoping to make breakthroughs in southern cities such as Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. The picture is made richer – or further complicated depending on your point of view – in places such as Bridgend by the part the independents may play. Wales has a proud tradition of backing candidates with no affiliations to the main parties. Steven Bletsoe, a founder of Bridgend County Independents, was delighted that Welsh Labour mentioned the threat of the independents in a party promotional film. “That’s something to stick on the changing room wall – an acknowldgement we’re challengers.” Bletsoe despises the sort of party machine that can sweep through the Brackla estate and the deals and compromises that are routine when a mainstream party governs. “That’s not for us. We like to debate and vote in the way our conscience leads us.” For the first time, 16 and 17-year-olds will get to vote in the Welsh local elections this week. At Cynffig comprehensive school in Bridgend county, a polling station will be open from Tuesday in the caretaker’s house to give pupils a chance to vote during the working day. Students said they were interested in issues including the environment, farming, the cost of living and equality. Tyler, a 16-year-old Labour activist, brought up Partygate and the lack of places for young people to go as issues he was interested in. Matthew, also 16, a Plaid Cymru supporter, said he was “infuriated’ with Boris Johnson and believed Wales was ignored by Westminster. There are still votes to be fought over. Another 16-year-old, Caitlin, said she had not thought much about politics until being given the vote now. “It’s good we’re going to get a vote. I’m worried about the lack of mental health provision, especially after lockdown. I haven’t made up my mind who to vote for – but I’m definitely going to vote.”",News/UK news,‘Boris the buffoon’: Tory scandals likely to boost Labour in Welsh local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/02/wales-local-elections-tory-scandals-labour-boost
5/2/2022,"These cauliflower tacos come from my new book, Meat-Free Mexican, which is out next week. In the book, they’re basted in a garlicky marinade made from the fruity, tangy seeds of the achiote tree, which is native to the Yucatan. With its distinct flavour and bright red colour, achiote works beautifully on cauliflower, and is increasingly available online. When I run out of it, however, I use harissa instead, which pairs beautifully with the classic Mexican combination of lime-pickled red onions and black beans. While achiote is mild, harissa can be quite fiery, so adjust the quantity to suit your taste.

Squeeze on the citrus juices, scrunch the onions for 10-15 seconds, then sprinkle with oregano, if using. Cover and chill for at least half an hour, to soften and pickle. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. In a mortar, smash the harissa and three whole garlic cloves to a paste. Add the oregano, half a teaspoon of salt and the sugar, and pound again, then stir in the yoghurt, lime juice and olive oil, and taste to check the seasoning. Cut the florets from the stem of the cauliflower, discarding the tough outer leaves and gnarly end of the stem, but keeping the tender inner leaves and the inner core. Cut the larger florets into halves or quarters and the inner core into similar-sized pieces (you want them bite-sized, but bear in mind that they will shrink when roasted). Arrange the cauliflower pieces over a large roasting tray (or two smaller ones), leaving room between the pieces so they roast rather than sweat. Rub all over with the paste, scrunch over a little sea salt, drizzle with olive oil, then roast for 30-35 minutes, until nicely caramelised all over. Heat the remaining oil in a pan and add the crushed garlic. Once it’s pale golden, stir in the black beans, heat through gently and season (in Mexico, you’d cook them with an avocado leaf or a touch of anise). Serve the cauliflower in tacos with the black beans and pickled onions, or with rice. A few wedges of lime never go astray, either. Try using achiote to marinade pork chops or halloumi, and serve with the same pink pickled onions.

5/2/2022,"Partygate could have been avoided if the police had properly investigated alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings, a former regional chief prosecutor has claimed. Nazir Afzal, the crown prosecutor for north-west England until 2015, also expressed exasperation at fresh revelations about the way Durham police looked into Cummings’s journeys to Durham and Barnard Castle after they were exposed by the Guardian and the Mirror in May 2020. Last month Durham’s chief constable, Jo Farrell, admitted that her officers did not interview Cummings as part of their three-day investigation into the lockdown movements of Boris Johnson then chief adviser. Instead she told the Mirror that the force treated Cummings’s televised press conference in Downing Street’s rose garden as a witness statement about his behaviour. In May 2021, Cummings admitted to MPs that he did not tell the whole truth in the rose garden. “I should probably explain some things about this that were not put into the public domain at the time in the rose garden,” he told a joint session of two select committees. Speaking to the Guardian, Afzal said: “The police relied on an account which the suspect himself has deviated from subsequently. That in itself makes it likely that the police investigation was flawed.” Afzal’s lawyers, Hodge Jones & Allen, have written to the Metropolitan police and Durham constabulary urging them to share any “lessons learned” about their handling of Cummings’s behaviour in the light of the more thorough investigation that officers were eventually conducted into Partygate. And they asked if the Met still stood by its decision not to investigate Cummings leaving London for Durham when he had suspected Covid. Afzal said: “Had the police promptly and robustly investigated those responsible for setting the rules, but seemingly breaching the rules, Partygate might not have happened. “In relation to Dominic Cummings, then a central player within Downing Street, Durham police could and should have done so at the time of the breaches and when presented with the evidence and complaints.” “Such action would have reinforced the message to the prime minister and those around him, that the Covid regulations, which they created and encouraged others to follow, should be observed, both in spirit and by the letter.” After a three-day investigation in May 2020, Durham police concluded that Cummings’s infamous journey to Barnard Castle probably amounted to a “minor” breach of the rules. But the force took no further action and made no finding on Cummings’s decision to leave London because the investigation was confined to County Durham. It also said there was “insufficient evidence” that Cummings made a second trip to Durham on 19 April 2020 despite taking statements from nurse practitioner Clare Edwards and her husband Dave claiming they had seen him in Durham that day. In February 2021 Durham police rejected a 225-page dossier submitted by Afzal’s lawyers alleging that Cummings had breached the Covid rules multiple times. It also alleged that Cummings perverted the course of justice in his account of his journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April and his denial of a claim that he made a second lockdown trip to Durham around 19 April. Last May, Cummings again insisted to MPs that that it was “false” to claim he made a second trip to Durham. But he appeared to concede they did leave London a second time because of security concerns: “It is true that I moved my family out again.” Asked at the time to explain how four people claimed to have seen him in an around Durham’s Houghall Woods on the morning of 19 April, Cummings told the Guardian. “I did not go back to Durham on [the] 19th. I was in London on [the] 19th and with my son on Hampstead Heath, and phone data proves it.” The Guardian has seen a photograph taken at 3.31pm that day appearing to show Cummings on the Hampstead Heath with his family. Is also established that it was possible to drive from Durham to London in under four hours during lockdown. Explaining Durham’s decision not to interview Cummings, Farrell told the Mirror: “I remember thinking, as he talked, that it would be the account of the circumstances … “From a proportionality point of view, there was an extensive and well documented narrative about what he had done and where he had been. We used that and information about the decision-making around it.” The Met told Afzal’s lawyers that it held no information on lessons learned from the Cummings case and referred the issue to Durham police. Durham police have yet to respond, but Farrell told the Mirror she was “confident and satisfied the decisions we took then will stand the test of time”.",News/Politics,Proper investigation of Cummings ‘might have prevented’ Partygate ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/partygate-dominic-cummings-nazir-afzal-critical-police
5/2/2022,"Ivica Osim was ill, his wife Asima said. Would I mind coming to his Sarajevo flat the following day? But the following day he was little better. Go to the cafe in the square, Asima said, wait there and he would try to come down later. By that point, in all honesty, I wasn’t expecting much. But after an hour or so he shuffled slowly over, sat down and began to talk. His voice was weak, his pale eyes watery, but when we said goodbye three hours later, it was because I had to go to the airport. That was in 2009 and Osim was still suffering the effects of the stroke two years earlier that ended his career as Japan manager. He had been watching an Arsenal game and when he came round in hospital, his first question was what the final score had been. In truth, he never really recovered and died on Sunday, five days short of his 81st birthday. But he talked, with characteristic eloquence, thoughtfulness and directness. He talked about playing for Yugoslavia when they beat England in the semi-final of the 1968 European Championship – “they were great runners. You played against Nobby Stiles, Alan Mullery, Bobby Charlton, and you thought they must be playing their twins as well, because it seemed there were such a lot of them” – and about Mullery becoming in that game the first England player sent off: “It was a big surprise, because Englishmen were famous for fair play at that time. In football, in games like that you sometimes forget yourself. Today it has gone too far as a business for fair play to matter. Even fair play is a business today.” He talked about managing Japan: “They have covered everything with full attention, and they know everything they need, but they simply do not have that. They have an inferiority complex, and also you can’t buy tradition … there is no risk, there is no improvisation in Japan, and football can’t exist without that … On the other hand, it’s very easy to work in Japan because the discipline is very hard. But maybe that isn’t so good because it kills a coach. Inevitably you start to lose ideas and authority. You don’t want to provoke crises, but you need problems so you can create solutions. The most important thing in Japan is to make them think with their own heads, not with somebody else’s.” He talked about commercialisation: “We are not excited by how Edin Dzeko is playing; we are waiting to see which club he will join next and what price he will be.” He talked about twice turning down the Real Madrid job and about his glory years at Sturm Graz. And he talked, with infinite sadness, about the war. Osim was coach of Yugoslavia at the 1990 World Cup. “The team,” he said, “was far, far better than the country. It would be a fantasy to lament that generation of players, and not to talk about what happened afterwards. Lots of people were killed. The country was destroyed. Sometimes there are things that are more important than football.” They lost on penalties to Argentina in the quarter-final, a game in which they had the better chances despite going down to 10 men after half an hour. Osim had to leave out the midfielder Srecko Katanec because his family had received death threats before the game. “I can’t persuade anybody not to think about that,” he said. “Instead of all the other things, you had to be careful about the name, about religion, about the club, about the region of the country a player’s from. You had to calculate everything. Everything is politics. Every club was politics and especially the national team was politics.” He was disillusioned, but remained romantic. “I think about what might have happened if we’d got past Argentina,” he said. “Maybe I am optimistic, but in my private illusion I wonder what might have happened if Yugoslavia had played in the semi-final or the final, what would have happened to the country. Maybe there would have been no war if we’d won the World Cup. I don’t think things would have changed in that way, but sometimes you dream about what might have happened.” Most of all he talked about football. Osim was many things: a tall, elegant forward noted for his dribbling ability, who was loved as much in Sedan, Valenciennes and Strasbourg, where he finished his career, as he had been at Zeljeznicar in his native Sarajevo; he was a coach who could be ferociously tough with his players (and his translators, one of whom he reduced to tears during the Asian Cup in 2007 because he felt he was conveying his anger towards his players with insufficient vigour); but most of all he was part of that great generation of Yugoslavs who travelled the globe playing and coaching but want most of all to be sitting in some Balkan square over a coffee, reminiscing and arguing about the game. He remained hugely popular in Japan, where a book of his sayings sold more than 400,000 copies and was still visited regularly by Japanese journalists. In his final years, as illness exhausted him, football was what kept Osim going, talking about it, or going to playgrounds to watch children play. It was his life. He hated much of what it had become, and yet he loved it still, for the joy it offered, and the relationships it could build between very different people. He was, first and foremost, a football man.",Sport/Football,Ivica Osim: a Yugoslavian football giant who twice rejected Real Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/02/ivica-osim-yugoslavian-football-coach-dies-aged-80
5/2/2022,"A critical fire risk has been put in place for south-western parts of the US this week. An upper-level trough of low pressure will deepen across the Rocky Mountains on Tuesday, which will cause surface pressure to fall. That means that surface winds across Arizona and New Mexico will pick up even more. These areas are currently experiencing a mere 5-15% relative humidity, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has deemed critical in exacerbating wildfire risk. Yet more dry, westerly winds will continue to affect these areas through this week, bringing further fire concern. This is not the first time that these areas have been affected by wildfires recently. New Mexico has already seen fires cover more than 39,000 hectares (97,000 acres) since mid-April, with thousands of people already evacuated. As a result, more than 950 firefighters have been deployed in these regions already. Furthermore, convective hazards are forecast further east in the US. As the trough mentioned previously moves eastwards, it will advect moisture and increase atmospheric instability. Hazards such as thunderstorms, strong winds, hail, heavy rain and even a few tornadoes are expected to form in the mid-to-late afternoons across the southern plains this week. Daily rainfall totals could exceed 70-80mm across parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. Tornadoes have already been affecting parts of Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma in recent days, and 6,500 people have been left without power. More than 100 buildings have been damaged. Meanwhile, a deepening but fairly stationary low-pressure system will feed persistent rainfall to south-eastern Brazil through Tuesday until Thursday. This feature will draw moist, tropical air from the central Atlantic before south-easterly winds take that moisture onshore to the states of Rio Grande and Santa Catarina, where 72-hour rainfall totals could exceed 150-200mm. Elsewhere, Australia will experience huge differences in temperature across the country through this week. Northern Australia will see maximum temperatures exceeding 30C, whereas New South Wales will see a chilly spell develop thanks to cold winds from Antarctica. Temperatures will barely reach double digits, which will be a shock after a mild autumn.",News/Environment,Windy weather to raise risk of wildfire in south-western US,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/02/windy-weather-to-raise-risk-of-wildfire-in-south-western-us
5/2/2022,"Sandra Castaneda spent 19 years in prison for a murder she didn’t commit. But when the California courts overturned her conviction in July 2021, the 40-year-old Los Angeles woman did not walk free. Instead, she was picked up by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents and taken to a federal detention center where she is now facing deportation to Mexico, a country she left at age nine. Castaneda has been in Ice detention for nine months, trapped in a Kafkaesque legal nightmare in which lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Ice, argue she should be deported due to the original murder charge even though the California courts and an immigration judge have said that her conviction was invalid. “I’m stuck here. There’s nothing to do all day and I get overwhelmed,” Castaneda said in a recent call from inside a detention center in the state of Georgia. “It’s like nothing applies to [Ice]. They can do whatever they want. It makes me angry … I’m just wasting time here.” Immigrants’ rights advocates say her case is extraordinarily unjust – but far from unique. The US has long deported immigrants based on their criminal records, routinely detaining people convicted of a wide range of offenses, leading people like Castaneda, who have legal status, to be threatened with removal. But as the US justice system reckons with its past and various states have passed reform laws meant to right the wrongs of mass incarceration and unjust convictions, the immigration system has not caught up. That means that across the US tens of thousands of people over the years have faced deportation even after courts have overturned their convictions, granted expungements and erased the offenses from their criminal records, legal experts estimate. And in recent years, the US government has actively thwarted new state reforms meant to fix this problem and stop deportations based on flawed convictions. “There’s discrimination baked into the system at every level,” said Andrew Wachtenheim, supervising attorney with the Immigrant Defense Project (IDP), an advocacy group that has challenged US deportation policies. “You have very racist state criminal laws that have been doing damage to communities of color for decades … and now you finally have some localities facing those injustices and enacting desperately needed legislation to alleviate the consequences, but for non-citizens, the reforms aren’t happening. It’s a second level of injustice.” Castaneda, who came to the US with a green card in 1991, grew up in South Central LA, a neighborhood that struggled with gang violence. She had a difficult childhood, with her mother leaving her to live with relatives at a young age, but she stayed out of trouble until 10 May 2002. Castaneda, then 20, was driving a group of friends to a restaurant that evening when one of them, who was affiliated with a local gang, fired without warning at a rival gang, injuring one person and killing another, her attorneys wrote in a recent filing. The passengers and shooter in the car all fled on foot, but Castaneda stopped a few blocks away, and was apprehended by police. Prosecutors did not allege that she took part in the killing or had any role in planning it, but she was convicted of murder and attempted murder under the state’s “felony murder rule”, which at the time dictated that anyone involved in a felony when a death occurs can face the same consequences as the person who committed the act. At age 21, Castaneda, who had no criminal record, was given a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 40 years. The shooter was never charged. “I had mentally prepared myself to die in prison, as a lifer … so I tried to do good for myself and for others,” said Castaneda, who got multiple degrees while incarcerated and served as a mentor, peer educator and advocate for terminally ill people behind bars. In recent years, officials across the California criminal justice system recognized the injustice of Castaneda’s conviction and her achievements: in 2019, the head of the California department of corrections recommended her sentence be reduced; in 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom commuted her sentence altogether, giving her an opportunity at early parole; and in 2021, a judge ruled that her conviction be entirely dismissed and she be immediately released, based on a new California law that dismantled parts of the felony murder rule due to concerns about unjust murder sentences for people not responsible for the deaths. On 27 July last year, the day she was scheduled to come home, California prison guards handed her over to Ice. Colby Lenz, an advocate with the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, who has known Castaneda for years, was waiting outside to pick her up and watched as an Ice van drove her away. “It was totally devastating, especially knowing that she was about to face a really long struggle and more horrible conditions in detention.” Ice officers initially told Castaneda that she would be released home to her family, with an ankle monitor, because Ice had no available bed in California: “I was so happy, I was finally going to go home to my family.” But later that day, the Ice officer said, “‘I found you a spot – you’re going to Atlanta,’” she recalled. “I just started crying. I couldn’t believe they would send me to the other side of the country. All my support is in California. I don’t have nobody in Georgia.” There’s no good data on deportations after convictions were invalidated, but immigration lawyers say it’s been a common occurrence for decades and continues to emerge when states enact new reforms. The challenges stem from a US Department of Justice ruling in the late 1990s and early 2000s, dictating that if a non-citizen’s conviction was dismissed due to a “procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings” (such as a straightforward wrongful conviction uncovered by DNA), then the individual would no longer be deportable. But if someone’s conviction was erased due to “rehabilitation” or certain other reforms, the standards hold they should still be deported. That decision applies to many non-citizens across the country who get their records expunged every year, including people who have successfully completed probation and other programs, and people who got old marijuana cases and related charges tossed out due to reform measures meant to address the “war on drugs”. Those expungements wipe an individual’s record clean, removing barriers to housing and employment, but the DoJ considers them irrelevant for most immigration purposes. “As far as the state is concerned, these convictions are invalid and don’t exist, but folks are still getting detained and deported,” said Anoop Prasad, an Asian Law Caucus (ALC) staff attorney representing Castaneda. Last year, for example, a New Jersey human trafficking survivor still faced deportation even after her convictions were dropped once she proved in state court that she was victimized. California, New York and other states have passed laws in recent years to help people dismiss convictions and ensure they are protected from deportation, but the federal government has fought to circumvent them. “Every criminal legal reform that we’ve passed, I’ve seen federal immigration attorneys attempt to argue that those reforms don’t pass muster in immigration court. It’s infuriating,” said Rose Cahn, senior staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC). For months, this has been the case for Castaneda. In October 2021, US lawyers argued that her “conviction remains a conviction for immigration purposes”. An immigration judge sided with Castaneda in November and said he did not believe she was deportable, though last week called for another hearing on the matter. And although Castaneda’s lawyers have obtained further documentation from a California judge making clear she no longer had a deportable offense, DHS is still fighting to remove her – and refusing to release her on bond as she fights her case. Immigrant advocates are pressuring the Biden administration and state officials to do more to stop deportations of people with dismissed convictions and old criminal records. A coalition of advocates has urged Biden’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, to restore a rule undone by the Trump administration that enabled some immigrants to avoid deportation if their criminal sentences were retroactively lowered. Some offenses are only deportable if the sentence is a certain length. Trump’s attorney general, William Barr, reversed this longstanding precedent in 2019. So far, the Biden administration has declined to change the rule or enact policies directing immigration officials to broadly recognize conviction dismissals. Spokespeople for the DoJ and White House declined to comment, and representatives of Ice and the DHS did not respond to inquiries about Castaneda’s case and the related deportation policies. Activists in California have also fought to stop the state from transferring people from prisons to Ice, arguing that states have the discretion to end the practice and that people who served their time should not face further punishment. So far, the governor has refused; Castaneda was one of 2,600 people handed over to Ice from California prisons from January 2020 through November 2021, according to data obtained by ALC. (The governor’s office did not respond to an inquiry.) Castaneda, thousands of miles from her family, doesn’t know what will happen if she loses her case: “I don’t see myself in Mexico. It’s hard for me to face the fact that I might have to go, because I don’t know a life there.” After all of the acknowledgments of her accomplishments behind bars, Ice’s refusal to even release her on bond has weighed on her: “They say I’m a ‘safety risk for the public’, and it frustrates me, because you’re focusing on my first charges. They’re not seeing the good things I’ve done. What else do you want?” Once released, she has dozens of family members and friends ready to support her in LA and a non-profit advocacy job lined up. Her message to the Biden administration? “Give us a second chance, allow us to do it right, to prove ourselves. The laws are changing, but it’s only on paper. They don’t honor that. They don’t honor the fact that you have family here. Check our records and you can see we tried to change our lives. Don’t just send us back to what we don’t know.”",News/US news,Her murder conviction was overturned.

5/2/2022,"I wanted to make a film about what me and my friends got up to on weekends. The 90s club scene was amazing. The rave generation was about love, the ecstasy worked and the music was underground – advertising hadn’t ruined it. Apart from the odd bad boy, the people were nice, eccentric characters who danced like loons all night. But there was nothing to represent us in cinema. I thought about all the films that first represented their subcultures – Quadrophenia, Saturday Night Fever, Sid and Nancy, Boyz N the Hood – and I hoped that mine, in its own little way, could represent ours accurately. I was 23 and had just graduated from Newport film school when I wrote the script. I would write Monday to Friday until my brain shut down, then on the weekends I would go out partying, and on the comedown I’d record everything that happened. The first draft was 400 pages. I had no idea of the structure and semiotics of screenwriting. What’s funny is that the film is full of scenes that would never make it through a development process: most don’t move the narrative forward at all. With regards to Jip, John Simm’s character, being impotent – that had happened to me as a student, with my paranoid, overactive mind. I thought back to those soul-destroying moments and decided to exorcise the demon once and for all by writing about it. No public or private financier in Britain would back the film, so the producers raised the £2.2m budget from private investors abroad. I had no interest in that side of things – I was just high on making my film. The first question I asked in auditions was: “Have you ever taken drugs?” It was essential the actors be a part of the rave scene. They were also all people I would want to hang out with – we made the film as friends. We shot on location in Cardiff, with the nightclub scenes at the Emporium, which has closed now. To the extras it was a big party – but I can’t say too much about the actors. Let’s just say we wanted it to be authentic. There was one day when 25 scenes were cut because we were behind schedule, so everyone got hammered at the hotel bar. John and I left at dawn – and then he told me he didn’t have to work that day. I had to go in and direct on no sleep. That was tough. I was quietly amazed that the film attracted no tabloid controversy, in the age of the “killer E”. I purposely left out any scenes of dropping pills, and the film clearly discusses the paranoia and physiological effects of drugs. But, whatever the tabloid sensationalism at the time, I included no deaths as that was not my experience, nor that of anyone I knew. I know there’s an audience out there hungry for a sequel, but it’s taken five years to get the rights, and now I’m trying to raise a budget. I still relate to the characters’ soul-searching in the original film, but these days it’s just new levels of middle-aged shit instead of the pains of youth. The way things are going now, clubs of the future will be people with the most “likes” wearing their Amazon Prime headphones listening to a DJ on Zoom. Or dancing your tits off in the metaverse with Mark Zuckerberg. When we read the script, we all thought: “Wow, this is our life.” I was in my mid-20s and clubbing a lot in London, at places like Turnmills and Bagley’s. Five years after the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which had outlawed “repetitive beats”, it was refreshing to read a script that was just telling it like it was: people going out, having a good time, and not dying. It was very low-budget, but such fun to make. It was like there were no grownups on set. I knew Shaun Parkes, who played record-shop owner Koop, already – we played in bands together. Danny Dyer and I became really good friends. We were all staying in the same hotel and, on days off, would go out together. Howard Marks, who filmed a skit called Spliff Politics, used to hang out in the hotel bar with the Super Furry Animals. He had Rizla papers with his own face on them. Justin wanted to make it real, so he let us riff and be loose with things. For a first-time director, he was brilliant. Quite a lot of the film was improvised, including the famous “Nice one, bruva!” scene. In the scene where we’re doing coke, Shaun and I were doing what we did at parties: talking bullshit. Contrary to opinion, I don’t think we were ever on drugs on camera. I had to wear contact lenses with dilated pupils. We filmed that scene three or four times, and it was different every single time. The ironic thing about Human Traffic was that it put paid to our clubbing lives. Me and Danny went to Creamfields after that. We were spotted dancing in a tent, and because every clubber had seen the film, we got hundreds of off-their-nuts people coming and hugging us. We couldn’t relax. To me, it’s like a time capsule: it perfectly captures the end of the 90s. That’s what it was like for millions of people every single weekend. It was a beautiful little snippet of time.",Arts/Film,How we made Human Traffic: ‘The first question I asked in the auditions was: have you ever taken drugs?’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/02/how-we-made-human-traffic
5/2/2022,"Is there any way to avoid the decay and frailty that come with age? Jeff Bezos thinks so. A biotech company that the founder of Amazon has helped fund, Altos Labs, is said to have $3bn at its disposal to research ways of holding back the clock. Closer to home, scientists at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge recently announced they had altered a 53-year-old woman’s skin cells so they behaved as though they were 30 years younger. Promising as this may seem, it’s a long road from the lab to the clinic. But the difficulty of translating scientific breakthroughs into treatment hasn’t stopped an explosion in research. To understand why the once fantastical idea of preventing or reversing ageing is even considered a possibility these days, we need to appreciate exactly what happens as we get older. The human body is made up of cells in a constant cycle of life and death. Different types of cells have their own inner clocks, determining how long they live. Sperm cells live about three days, while some brain cells last a lifetime. The upper layer of skin which you can see and touch is regenerated every 30 days or so. As time goes by, however, many types of cell in the human body become less good at reproducing themselves by dividing. Skin cells from a newborn baby can divide 80 or 90 times, but cells from an elderly person divide about 20 times before they stop. So one reason we age is that our cells age. But other things are happening too: we become wrinkly because elderly skin cells produce less collagen and elastin, and sebaceous glands produce less oil. Surface bruises happen more easily because blood vessels become fragile. Ageing is multifaceted. One thing we do know is that there isn’t actually a hard biological limit to how long we can survive. Some animals live much longer than we do. Jonathan, for example, is a 190-year-old giant tortoise from the Seychelles. Other tortoises might be even older, but Jonathan is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the oldest living land animal because there’s a photo of him in his heyday aged 50, munching on grass. Bowhead whales can live for more than 200 years and some sponges are thought to survive for more than 2,000. The oldest human whose age has been verified was Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, outliving her grandson. Although Calment’s grandson wasn’t as lucky as her, long lifespans like this do tend to run in families. Twin studies appear to show that the genetic contribution to longevity is around 25%. Astonishingly, genetic mutations in nematode worms, which normally live for about three weeks, can increase their lifespan by up to 10 times. Needless to say, nothing like this is possible for humans. Instead, hundreds of human gene variants are linked to ageing, each having a small effect on their own, but combining in complex ways. Deciphering this picture will require the efforts of all kinds of scientists, including biologists, physicians, mathematicians and computer scientists. This is an area where having a big budget really does help. There is a lot we still don’t know about genes and ageing but, as we’ve seen, it is possible to manipulate genes to make cells become young again in a lab dish. In the mid-2000s, Japanese scientist Shinya Yamanaka showed that the introduction of four genes – the Yamanaka factors – into adult cells caused them to revert to stem cells normally found in embryos (and capable of becoming all the different kinds of cells in the human body). Today, researchers are seeking ways to control this process more finely, to use Yamanaka factors to roll back the age of cells, or repair damaged tissues, without them going all the way back to an embryo-like state. This appears to be what the team at the Babraham achieved, by exposing aged skin cells to Yamanaka factors for a relatively short period. Important problems remain, however, because the very same factors which make cells young again can also make cancer more likely. There are other ideas on the table for combating ageing. We could, for example, directly clear away old cells that are causing problems. Cells that remain alive but have stopped dividing are deemed “senescent”. These senescent cells accumulate in the body over a lifetime – especially in the skin, liver, lungs and spleen – and have both beneficial and detrimental effects. They are beneficial because they secrete factors which help repair damaged tissue, but as senescent cells increase in number, they can disrupt the normal structure of organs and tissues. Mice in which senescent cells were cleared away took longer to show signs of ageing. Nobody knows the extent to which Altos Labs, or any other organisation, is going to solve this puzzle. But what is clear is that there will be spin-offs from the effort, such as new ways of aiding tissue repair, fighting cancer, or boosting immunity. A crucial point here is that the mission to beat ageing has a vastness to it in the same way that landing on the moon wasn’t just about landing on the moon; it is a journey which will lead to all sorts of new technologies, scientific knowledge and medical outcomes. The worms provide a note of caution too. Those long‑lived genetic mutants have a much extended period of frailty, which emphasises the importance of focusing on increasing not just lifespan, but healthspan. Beyond that, ageing isn’t just a personal issue: it is entwined with social, economic, psychological and other concerns. Should we, for example, work until our 70s or 80s? How will we ensure equality when the rich already live longer than the poor? Perhaps the most pertinent question of all, to which each of us must find our own answer: what will be our purpose? What would make us happy, in those extra years?

5/2/2022,"Speaking at a rally two days ahead of voting in a heated Republican Senate primary in Ohio, Donald Trump appeared to forget the name of JD Vance, the candidate he has endorsed. “You know,” the former president told a crowd in Greenwood, Nebraska, on Sunday, “we’ve endorsed Dr Oz.” So he has, in Pennsylvania. Of Ohio, Trump said: “We’ve endorsed – JP, right? JD Mandel, and he’s doing great. They’re all doing good. They’re all doing good. And let’s see what happens.”” Trump appeared to be confusing JD Vance, a former US marine, author of the bestseller Hillbilly Elegy and venture capitalist, with Josh Mandel, a rival who courted Trump for the endorsement. Trump also said: “I think Vance is doing well, I think Oz is doing well. Does everybody like Oz? I love Oz.” Announcing his endorsement last month, Trump said: “In the great state of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is JD Vance. We cannot play games. It is all about winning!” Vance said then he was “incredibly honored to have President Trump’s support”. He did not immediately comment about Trump’s slip on Sunday. Trump’s endorsement – despite past remarks in which Vance called Trump “America’s Hitler” and “a moral disaster” – boosted Vance to the top of the polls in Ohio. On Sunday, Mandel continued to hammer his opponent for such remarks, including saying in 2016 he might vote for Hillary Clinton if it seemed Trump might win. Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. JP. JD. Mandel. Oh hell. https://t.co/zSwbL6txRB In the same rally in Greenwood, Trump, 75, mocked Joe Biden, 79 and the president who beat him in 2020, for stumbling over his words. Biden has often discussed his struggle to overcome a stutter. Amid widespread delight over Trump’s Vance-Mandel slip, the columnist Julia Davis referred to a notorious interview in which Trump discussed passing a cognitive test which he insisted was “difficult”. Davis wrote: “Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. JP. JD. Mandel. Oh hell.” Trump’s rally on Sunday was in support of Charles Herbster, a candidate for governor in Nebraska who – like Trump – faces accusations of sexual assault and misconduct. “I defend people when I know they’re good,” Trump said. “A lot of people, they look at you and say: ‘You don’t have to do it, sir.’ I defend my friends.”",News/US news,"‘JP, right?’ Donald Trump appears to forget name of candidate he endorsed",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/donald-trump-forget-name-jd-vance-josh-mandel
