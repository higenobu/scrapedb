2/19/2022,"Prince Andrew’s decision to cut his losses and settle out of court with Virginia Giuffre grabbed all the headlines. But the most far-reaching legal activity this week may have taken place in London rather than New York, with disturbing implications for the freedom of the press. On Wednesday, in a landmark privacy case, the UK supreme court ruled that suspects in a criminal investigation have the right not to be named in the media, prior to charges being brought against them. On that basis, it rejected an appeal against a previous high court judgment by Bloomberg News, which was found to have breached the privacy rights of a US business executive by naming him as the subject of a criminal inquiry. In one sense, this was nothing new. The judgment merely confirmed a direction of travel that began a decade ago with the Leveson inquiry. The phone-hacking scandal that led to Leveson came to symbolise the excesses of intrusive and prurient reporting by the tabloid press in particular. In its wake, the concept of privacy – outlined in article 8 of the European convention on human rights – has been interpreted ever more broadly and generously by courts. The right to free expression – and the freedom of the press to report – has correspondingly taken a back seat. In 2018, in the most high-profile case of this type, the high court ruled that the BBC broke privacy law by identifying Sir Cliff Richard as being under investigation over allegations of sexual abuse. He was never arrested or charged.  The potential harm to named suspects who are never charged was always capable of being recognised through a defamation claim. But in the way they choose to balance the competing rights of privacy and freedom of expression, these legal judgments reflect the changed perspectives and priorities of the post-Leveson decade. Wednesday’s ruling was a sign that the pendulum has swung too far towards the suppression of information which is of legitimate public interest. The Bloomberg case concerned a criminal investigation into the business activities of an executive in a large public company with investors, customers and shareholders. As the news organisation’s editor-in-chief pointed out in a written response, extending the scope of privacy law to this extent will hobble investigative journalism into corporate wrongdoing. From the Libor banking scandal to the exposure of accounting fraud at Wirecard, the public value of such reporting has been repeatedly demonstrated. Nor is it advisable to throw a cloak of secrecy over police investigations, shielding them from the public gaze and accountability. Perhaps most importantly, an excessive legal presumption in favour of privacy removes the possibility of publicity leading to new testimony, as members of the public come forward. This was the way that Harvey Weinstein was brought to justice after decades of sexual predation. The Bloomberg verdict made clear that there may be cases in which the naming of suspects is in the public interest. But this judgment sends an unequivocal message that the threshold of justification will be intimidatingly, prohibitively high. The right to privacy and protection from reputational damage is in danger of becoming a catch-all instrument with which the powerful and wealthy can erect a screen around the entirety of their lives and shut down scrutiny. A healthy democracy requires a better balance to be struck between the freedom of the press and the right to privacy.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on privacy law and press freedom: failing to strike a balance | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/18/the-guardian-view-on-privacy-law-and-press-freedom-failing-to-strike-a-balance
2/19/2022,"The flourishing of the Welsh language in the 19th century and its survival through the last century was, contrary to the claim of your editorial (11 February), almost entirely to do with that industrialisation of south Wales which ensured that the Welsh largely migrated internally. There were more Welsh speakers in Glamorgan in 1951 than in the rest of Wales altogether. The notion of “English suppression” is a convenient and distorted excuse for a complicated process of social and cultural change. Further, if Thatcherism helped to destroy the economic infrastructure of industrial Wales, it did not scatter the population that, by generational rootedness, has best claim to being a “Welsh heartland”, with an experienced history which was neither a “mythology” nor one dependent on hoary old cliches derived from How Green Was My Valley.  One of that real history’s legacies was Labour’s delivery of a devolution settlement in 1997. As for the cultural revivalism, as opposed to any linguistic imposition that has followed on from deindustrialisation, it was not S4C but BBC Wales that led the way in securing an audience for both popular programming, serious documentaries and vital new drama, while other connected outcomes have been the foundation of National Theatre Wales, the Library of Wales series of classic English language fiction and a tsunami of creative writing in the Dragon’s other and eloquently expressive tongue. When close relatives speak to each other effectively, it has to be a dialogue based on knowledge, not wish fulfilment. Certainly, volume is not all, whether from propinquity or distance, and it is not only Jeremy Bowen who speaks for his Wales from England, as others do for theirs. Long may the conversation continue.Prof Dai SmithBarry Island, Vale of Glamorgan  Your editorial on Welsh ends by inviting everyone to rejoice in the survival of this unquenchable language. But the article makes no reference to the exciting number of young people, whether from monoglot English families or Welsh-language homes, who are becoming bilingual speakers through the Welsh education system. As a professional storyteller, I work in and through oracy. Listening to young bilingual speakers moving effortlessly between the two equal languages of Wales is inspiring, and their competence and fluency bodes well for the future of the spoken and literary arts. To be able to express oneself in not one but two mother tongues merits celebration. Whether or not the Welsh government reaches its target of a million speakers by 2050, it is my firm belief that everyone in Wales (even those just “passing through”) is already somewhere on the continuum of bilingualism. Many are nowhere near fluent, but, thanks to the government’s commitment to bilingual signage, everyone knows what to expect if they stand long enough at a safle bws, or that they can leave their car in a maes parcio while they shop. Children and young people in Wales are gaining not one but two languages as their birthright, and a very wonderful thing this is too. For the generations of my age and older, who went to school at a time when it was considered that speaking Welsh would hold you back, I hope this is of some comfort. And for those of us who are pushing on a bit, it is never too late to start to learn. It has taken me 20 years, but I am now a pretty fluent speaker of Welsh, and it has enriched my life enormously.Fiona CollinsCarrog, Denbighshire  Brought up in England, but with a Welsh-speaking mother and Welsh husband, I was thrilled to read your summing up of recent debates on the Welsh language. Your editorial said: “It does not solely define Welshness, but it contributes to its many-sidedness and unquenchable hwyl.” That fabulous, significant word, expressing joy and excitement but much more, has no exact English translation.

2/19/2022,"My friend Mitzi Davies, who has died of pneumonia aged 81, was an actor who took joy and delight in treating the whole world as her stage. She was a tiny woman, only just over 5ft in height, but resonated with so much merriment, fun and vivacity that nobody would ever forget her presence. She had the most compelling eyes and a smile sufficient to put a lighting director out of work. She was born Eileen Rogers in Glasgow, but discarded her first name in favour of that held by a particularly charming kitten she encountered, and it would be as Mitzi Rogers that she made her name. Having won a scholarship to Rada in London, she was swiftly cast thereafter in some of the most popular television programmes of her era and was in constant employment for more than three decades. Among the series in which she appeared were The Avengers, The Sweeney, Z-Cars, Minder, The Woodlanders, Dr Finlay’s Casebook and Coronation Street. In the last of these, as Jenny Sutton, she married Elsie Tanner’s son, Dennis, in 1968.  Her films included the 1980 Agatha Christie adaptation Why Didn’t They Ask Evans? Before retiring in the early 1990s, she had parts in The Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Devices and Desires, a TV miniseries adapted from PD James’ novel of the same name. Mitzi was the elder of two daughters born to Derek Rogers and Betty Hamilton Fingland, who were both teenagers when they married. In 1943, with two children under three and her husband conscripted into the forces, Betty broke her back in an accident. Mitzi was sent to live with her paternal grandparents and was raised by them in Northamptonshire. John Rogers, a former physician to Lord Willington, the viceroy of India, and his wife, Eileen, were both Anglo-Indians, born in the subcontinent, who had recently returned to the UK, and Dr Rogers practised as a country GP. This rural upbringing fostered Mitzi’s lifelong love of animals; while at boarding school she also developed her enthusiasm for drama, in any form. In 1963, Mitzi married Keith Butt, a veterinary surgeon, but two years later fell in love with the television drama director John Davies. They married in 1969 and had two children, Sophie and Ben. By the 1980s they spent more time in Corfu and both met new partners. Thereafter Mitzi lived with Judy Mackrell, who had come to Corfu through her work with Gerald Durrell. They lived a blissfully happy life, most of the year in Tritsi, high up the remote mountainside with astonishing views over the Corfu channel to Albania, rattling down the precipitous roads in their battered Citroen 2CV to socialise with their countless friends in many tavernas. Glitzy Mitzi of Tritsi (as my late husband dubbed her) never lost her glamour nor her unquenchable love of life. Even in the Greek sunshine, she brought an added light to life. She is survived by Judy, to whom she was married in 2015, and by her children and grandchildren, Tom, Joe, Mia and Cobey.",Arts/Television & radio,Mitzi Davies obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/mitzi-davies-obituary
2/19/2022,"It was good to read Larry Elliott’s article on trade unions, in which he dispels well-worn myths (Unions don’t call the shots any more – but we’d all be better off if they did, 10 February). I would argue that strong trade unions are good for the economy and for reducing inequality. The Nordic models, for example, are characterised by high union densities – around 70%-80% of workers are members of a union, collective bargaining between unions and employers is allowed in the majority of workplaces and industries, and the trade unions are key players in social dialogue – a system of consultation between unions, employers and the government around key economic and social policies.  Incidentally, this model is not too dissimilar to one proposed in the Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour party manifesto in 2019. The Nordic models are the most equal of the developed capitalist countries, with the lowest rates of child poverty and highest rates of public provision in childcare and social services. Following the Covid crisis, Denmark and Norway had some of the lowest rates of public sector debt, and only Finland had a public sector deficit in 2019. Since the crisis, the Danish trade unions have played a key role in ensuring an adequate system of social protection and safety net. Unemployment benefits amount to up to a maximum of around £2,000 per month in Denmark, compared with average UK benefits of around £450-£500 a month.David EtheringtonProfessor of local and regional economic development, Staffordshire University  Larry Elliott, lamenting the decline of unions, reminded us of the GMB’s suggestion that the governor of the Bank of England should spend a day as a care worker to appreciate what low pay means. That is little better than politicians donning hard hats to wander around a building site. What they really need to do is to spend a month or more doing such jobs, earning the pay that goes with it. However, 20 or more years ago, Adam Holloway, a former army officer, made a documentary in which he spent three months unemployed, trying to negotiate his way through the benefit system. That experience didn’t stop him from becoming the Tory MP for Gravesham and a member of the European Research Group. Perhaps such people have become so wealthy that they don’t want to learn, to understand and to look for remedies for the inequalities in this country. Levelling up?

2/19/2022,"I was greatly amused by Arwa Mahdawi’s article (I’m putting my foot down – only barbarians wear shoes inside, 16 February) as it touched on one of the biggest cultural shocks that I’ve had since arriving in the UK from Hong Kong last summer. Being the typical cleanliness-obsessed Hongkonger, I Googled a house-cleaning company upon arriving at our rented place, hoping for a thorough move-in clean. My jaw dropped when the team marched in to the house in their street shoes and proceeded with the work like it was the most usual thing to do. I wondered if anyone else saw the irony in vacuuming and washing carpets and floors while stepping on them in street shoes. I was traumatised. My second experience came the following month when I had the chance to visit a local’s house and was told I didn’t need to take my shoes off – it was a deeply unsettling experience to step in and make my way across the carpet into someone’s living room wearing shoes. This would have been unimaginable back home.  I posted the question online with fellow newcomers from Hong Kong and one guy said: “Nothing so surprising, don’t you remember that Mr Bean went to bed in his street shoes?” And so I came to accept this as a cultural difference and just how things are done here – until I read Arwa’s piece.Joanna TongLondon  Re Arwa Mahdawi’s article, I must admit to wearing shoes indoors.

2/19/2022,"A mother and stepfather have been sentenced to six years in prison for locking up and starving their autistic son in a room of “abject squalor and filth” for seven months. Matthew Langley, 22, was “days away from death” when he was found in June 2020 weighing just 6st 2lb (39kg). Lorna Hewitt, 43, and her husband, Craig Hewitt, 42, were found guilty of false imprisonment and causing or allowing a vulnerable adult to suffer serious physical harm at Sheffield crown court last month.  The trial heard Langley had learning difficulties and suffered from irritable bowel syndrome, double-incontinence and arthritis. Photos show the attic bedroom in which he was kept captive was covered in piles of rubbish, and soiled with vomit and faeces, which had attracted flies. Police said they found the key on the outside of the door. Passing sentence, Judge Michael Slater said A&E staff had to take the “unprecedented” step of washing Langley when he arrived at the hospital. The court was told the couple had been trying to have Langley “taken off their hands”, and had prevented him from attending college as well as cancelling a string of medical appointments in the seven months in which they kept him locked in the room. “This was a grave abuse of trust by a mother to her son,” Judge Slater said, adding that the pair had “effectively turned off” Langley’s care in November 2019. “You were the primary carer for Matthew, with his challenges and difficulties, and it makes it all the more inexplicable that for those seven months you failed to provide him with the support and provision of food and drink that he craved and needed.” He added that Langley had likely spent a “long seven months experiencing feelings of anxiety, confusion, hunger and loneliness”. He praised staff at Northern General hospital for their efforts to save Langley, who “looked doomed not to survive” when he was admitted. He was treated for severe malnourishment and dehydration, with one expert dietician at the hospital telling the court it was the most severe malnourishment case he had seen. Langley had suffered kidney damage due to high sodium levels caused by severe dehydration, and also had a number of skin abrasions that suggested he had been crawling around on all fours. The court was told Langley made a full physical recovery by August 2020, but the psychological impact of the abuse had not been ascertained.",News/UK news,Mother and stepfather jailed for six years for locking up and starving autistic son,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/matthew-langley-mother-stepfather-jailed-locking-up-starving
2/19/2022,"My father, Ivor Smith, who has died aged 92, personified the benefits of widening access to higher education. Having left school aged 15, and started work at the General Electric Company in Birmingham, he managed to gain the necessary qualifications for university admission and eventually became professor of electrical power engineering at Loughborough University, where he also served as head of the electronic and electrical engineering department, dean of engineering and pro-vice-chancellor. He wrote or contributed to more than 450 technical papers and served on the MoD’s Defence Scientific Advisory Council. In 1988 he was elected fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.  Ivor was born in Birmingham, the son of Elsie (nee Underhill) and Howard Smith, and left school without even being entered for any school-leaver qualifications. The 1940s was an era of heavily segregated education; the assumption at institutions such as Handsworth technical school, where he went, was that all boys would ply their trade as industrial apprentices. That was indeed Ivor’s focus for the next few years, working at the General Electric Company’s sprawling Witton campus, where his father was employed. But two university students undertaking industrial placement inspired him with tales of academic endeavour, and the chance encounter changed his life. For the next few years, any spare moments were devoted to securing his Ordinary School Certificate and Higher National Certificate (the equivalents of today’s GCSEs and A-levels) – prerequisites for university admission. He then gained BSc and PhD degrees in electrical engineering from Bristol University, as well as a DSc from Birmingham University, where he was appointed a lecturer in 1959. In 1974 he joined Loughborough University, where he remained for the rest of his career. His pioneering research focused on the production, conditioning and utilisation of large pulses of electrical power. The work done by the Plasma and Pulsed Power Research Group that he founded led to Loughborough becoming pre-eminent in the field. He and his colleagues had security clearance to undertake classified projects for the Ministry of Defence and Nato, collaborating extensively with other universities. Ivor was instrumental in many technological innovations including magnetically insulating high-voltage transformers, pulsed power generation for high-impedance loads, multiple-phase twin-output, high-voltage generation, and unconventional microwave generation. The research had many bio-medical applications, including contactless methods for cancer treatment using intense pulsed electric fields, pre-packed solid food processing using a non-invasive technology, and processing and recovering precious metals from electronic waste. He continued working daily at Loughborough University until his late 80s. Throughout, he remained an avid supporter of Aston Villa FC and Warwickshire county cricket club. He is survived by his wife, Pamela (nee Voake), whom he married in 1962, his three sons, Andrew, Michael and me, and six grandchildren.",News/Technology,Ivor Smith obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/18/ivor-smith-obituary
2/19/2022,"Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on the borders with Ukraine, the US warned on Friday, claiming it was “the biggest mobilisation of troops since the second world war” and an increase of more than 90,000 in less than a month. The estimate including Russian backed troops inside Ukraine only added to a growing sense of foreboding among western diplomats, as they gathered for a major security conference in Munich, that their efforts to avert war in Europe were doomed and that Vladimir Putin had irrevocably chosen the path of conflict.  News that the Russian-supporting republics of Donetsk and Luhansk had announced a mass evacuation of the region’s residents to Russia and reports of a car bomb in Donetsk close to the separatists’ headquarters added to fears of an impending assault as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, warned of a strategy of “creating false provocations”. In Moscow, it was announced that Putin would this weekend oversee a drill of nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. “This is one of the most dangerous moments where provocation and disinformation might turn into escalation,” said German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock. “What is at stake for the people of Ukraine is their right to determine their own future, and, for all of us, what is at stake is nothing less than peace in Europe and whether we are going to defend our rules-based order, even if it comes to a crunch.” She also warned the scale of violence had dramatically increased in the past 48 hours. The conflict is not a Ukraine crisis, she said “it is a Russia crisis,” adding: “Those who want to live together in safety do not threaten each other.” Speaking alongside Blinken, Baerbock vowed Germany was “willing to pay a high price in economic terms” through sanctions, adding everything was on the table including the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. EU foreign ministers will look at their expected sanctions package on Monday, but western officials said it may be necessary to hit Russia “quickly and at scale” in the event of a non-conventional attack on Ukraine. Sanctions could be implemented “where we judge that Russia has crossed a line on this,” the officials said. The warnings came as the US president Joe Biden prepared to hold further talks with European leaders by phone with the discussion as much now focused on how to respond, rather than deter to an attack. Foreign ministers in Munich are likely to look at the threat of a major humanitarian crisis developing if refugees flee war through Poland. The US is nevertheless still hoping that the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov will hold talks on Russia and Nato’s rival schemes for a future security map of Europe at the end of next week, possibly in Geneva. Blinken warned that everything he was seeing suggested Russia had decided not to embark on the path of diplomacy and he feared the developments of the last 48 hours were likely part of a Russian plan to create false provocations. He said he remained fully engaged with diplomacy, but the west had to be informed by history, including the Russian invasions of Ukraine in 2014 and Georgia in 2008. “We have to be informed by the facts, and the facts are that despite what Russia has said in recent days about pulling back troops from the border [that] has not happened. On the contrary, we see additional forces going to the border including leading-edge forces that will be part of any aggression,” he said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, called for an end to shelling on the frontline in eastern Ukraine. “I welcome what President Putin has said but I believe that if you want to be a reliable partner then deeds should be in line with declarations and I would like to see specific actions. As regards to pressure, military pressure, from Russia, destabilising acts, the increasing number of shelling in the contact zone, firstly we call for a ceasefire on such military actions, resume dialogue, because we continue to believe that dialogue is the way to move this situation forward. The tense mood at the conference was underscored when Baerbock was directly challenged by the mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, over Germany’s provision of just 5,000 helmets to Ukraine. But Baerbock stood her ground about Germany’s refusal to supply weapons to Ukraine saying now was not the moment for a 180-degree turn on Germany’s historic position on not selling arms into conflict zones. She said different countries had different contributions, and Germany was doing more than any other country economically to help Ukraine, adding: “We all have different roles and different history.” But she revealed Germany was looking at a fresh Ukrainian request for military help. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, accused of being a powerless bystander in the conflict, warned the threat to global security is now greater than during the cold war. He called on all parties to be extremely careful with their rhetoric. “Public statements should aim to reduce tensions, not fuel them,” he said. “I still think it won’t happen. But, if it did, it would be catastrophic,” Guterres warned of the risk of an incalculable escalation. “This can also be triggered by communication breakdowns and false assumptions. During the cold war, there were also risk assessment mechanisms and informal ways of prevention. Today, most of these systems no longer exist and the people who used them are no longer there.” Additional reporting by Dan Sabbagh",News/World news,"Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine borders, US warns",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/russia-has-amassed-up-to-190000-troops-on-ukraine-borders-us-warns

From England, the record-breaking gales have begun moving across the continent, hitting Belgium, the Netherlands and parts of northern France, and are expected to reach Denmark and Germany on Friday evening.  Dutch authorities issued a red weather warning and hundreds of flights were cancelled, while trains were halted on Friday afternoon. Three people were reported to have been killed after being hit by falling trees. Pieces of the roof of the ADO The Hague football club stadium were blown off, authorities said. Belgian authorities appealed to citizens to only venture out in an emergency, while in the northern French province of Brittany, four-metre high waves were reported and rail travel was curtailed. In Denmark, trains were ordered to reduce speed and bridges and roads have been closed in preparation for record winds. In Germany, where the storm has been named Zeynep by meteorologists, it is expected to reach speeds of up to 160 kilometres (100 miles) per hour and to last into the early hours of Saturday morning. In addition, a thunderstorm is expected to develop within the storm, meteorologists said. The country, along with neighbouring Poland and Czech Republic, is still reeling from storm Ylenia, which hit on Wednesday night, uprooting trees, overturning lorries and causing three deaths in Germany, including that of a 37-year-old man whose car was hit by a tree. Deutsche Bahn, the national train operator, cancelled regional and long-distance trains, as emergency services in parts of northern and western Germany, including North Rhein Westphalia, Berlin, Brandenburg and Hamburg, were put on high alert. A spokesperson for DB described the weather warnings as “severe” and urged travellers to delay their journeys, promising that the validity of their tickets would be extended. The German meteorological service (DWD) declared a level three storm warning for the whole country, and highest level four warning for the entire 1,300 kilometre (808 mile)-long North Sea coast. On the North Sea islands, winds were expected to reach speeds as high as 170km (105 miles) an hour. The carmaker Volkswagen was one of many factories to close its works in the North Sea coastal town of Emden on Friday afternoon, cancelling both the late and night shifts in anticipation of the storm. DWD called the storms “life threatening” due mainly to flying objects such as falling trees. People were urged to close doors and windows and to secure all movable objects including garden furniture, bikes and portable bins. DWD has predicted widespread flooding in the coming days, particularly in the port cities of Cuxhaven and Hamburg, which was also badly hit by Wednesday’s storm.

2/19/2022,"The two letters (11 February) about the 2,500 Jewish refugees and prisoners of war shipped to Australia on the troopship HMT Dunera told only part of the fascinating story. One described the guards throwing overboard many of the internees’ personal possessions. Less widely known is that this saved their lives and the ship. This included the life of my great-uncle, Friedrich Schroeder. Days out of Liverpool, the Dunera was torpedoed by U-boat U56. One torpedo failed to detonate and a second passed beneath the vessel. But seeing the discarded luggage later, the U-boat captain sent divers to retrieve some. Reading the many German letters and documents, the captain called off the waiting U-boat pack to give the vessel safe passage, not wanting to repeat the tragedy of the SS Arandora Star a week earlier. That ship had been sunk en route to Canada, with the loss of 800 people, mostly German and Italians. The U56 story came to light only in 1980 when the captain’s logbook was released.  The Dunera was the only ship sent to Australia. The outcry after the Arandora Star sinking led to an impassioned debate in parliament on 10 July 1940, and the policy was cancelled.

Those spoken to as part of the Cabinet Office probe were told they could see the notes with a member of Gray’s team present but would not be allowed to bring a phone into the room, to be accompanied by a lawyer, or to request any changes.  Gray admitted that it was not “standard practice in internal investigations such as this” to share notes with interviewees, but said in a letter seen by the Guardian that she had decided “as an exceptional measure” that they would get “limited access”. This will let interviewees view the evidence they gave to her before it is passed to police, who have opened a separate criminal investigation nicknamed Operation Hillman. The deadline for Johnson to submit a questionnaire sent out to all those believed to have attended law-breaking gatherings neared on Friday night. He was sent the document by the Metropolitan police last Friday evening, and given seven days to complete it and provide an explanation for why he was at some of the parties under investigation. Johnson is expected to argue he broke no rules because he used No 10 as part of his working day, given it is both his home and an office shared with hundreds of other special advisers and civil servants. More than 50 questionnaires have so far been issued to Downing Street staff, and the outgoing Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, said last week that “some but probably not all may very well end up with a fixed penalty notice”. It came as Alec Shelbrooke, the MP for Elmet and Rothwell, became the latest backbench Conservative to express his anger with the prime minister. In an email to a constituent, seen by the Guardian, Shelbrooke said: “I’ve always sought to be straight-talking with my constituents so you will not hear me attempting to defend the indefensible. I am angry at events of recent weeks in Westminster, as I know others are.” Shelbrooke said he had followed Covid rules “to the letter”, adding that he had not seen his parents for 15 months, “even when I technically could when rules relaxed”, because he believed the public hold MPs to a higher standard. He would not reveal whether he had submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister, saying only: “I believe in the confidential nature of the 1922 [committee] process; however, I will say thank you for letting me know your personal views, which I can assure you I have taken into account.” Another senior backbencher told the Guardian they did not believe the recent respite for the prime minister would continue indefinitely. “Even if we have up to a month of calm, all the underlying issues remain,” said the former minister, who suggested the pressure on Johnson was “coming in waves”.

The field hospitals have been set near the border, blood banks have reportedly been brought in. On the information war front, a dossier of alleged Ukraine war crimes circulated at the UN security council, and a video popped up purporting to show an attempted Ukrainian attack on chlorine tanks in the Donbas.  Now the rebel leaders in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts have ordered the evacuation of women and children to Russia, claiming – with no evidence whatsoever – that a Ukrainian attack is imminent. Right on cue, a car bomb went off in Donetsk, injuring no one, but providing a fireball for the cameras. All of this is more or less what US and UK briefers have told journalists to expect in the run-up to a Russian invasion. The one piece that had been missing from Vladimir Putin’s relentless build-up was an effort to prepare the Russian population for the prospect of a major war. That piece seems to be slotting into place. Just as Russian armour and helicopters are edging up the border, Russian messaging is also advancing to the brink. War is becoming more probable by the hour, but it still does not necessarily mean that Putin has made his final decision. Other explanations are still possible, and events unfolding today may be messier than a single Kremlin-orchestrated master plan. If the chlorine video was the “false flag” pretext for war, it is a very crude and low-budget version of what US and British briefers had predicted, which had involved actors, borrowed corpses and high production values. In a similar vein, the dossier presented to the security council on Thursday was extremely thin and did not claim anything other than civilians have been killed in shelling on the rebel side of the lines in the Donbas since 2014. That was already known, it mirrors civilian casualties on the other side, and falls a very long way short of genocide. The most alarming development of the day is the evacuation from Luhansk and Donetsk, creating a sudden refugee crisis in neighbouring Rostov in Russia. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, and the Rostov governor claim to have been caught unawares by this move. They could quite possibly be lying, to add to the pretence of spontaneity. But it is not impossible that the rebel Donbas leaders are seizing an opportunity, using the crisis Putin has created to force his hand, with the aim of leaving him no choice but to recognise the republics as the Russian Duma is demanding. “I know it’s easy to read into this as part of Putin’s grand plot,” Gennady Rudkevich, a Russia expert at Georgia College, argued. “But there are a lot of parties that are affected by what happens next (positively and negatively). Some might be following the Kremlin’s orders. But others might be trying to deny Putin any option but invasion.” Putin’s carefully curated mystique is designed to keep everyone else guessing while he keeps his options open. Ukraine and its backers have not made the concessions he has demanded, so perhaps Putin believes that they just haven’t been scared enough, and is laying on what we have been primed to expect in the hours before a war. The finger has tightened around the trigger, but there remains a small, ever diminishing, chance it might not be pulled.",News/World news,Last piece of Putin’s puzzle slots into place: preparing Russians for war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/russia-ukraine-invasion-war-vladimir-putin-analysis
2/19/2022,"Sajid Javid is right to argue against scrapping the Office for National Statistics’ Covid surveillance study (Cabinet splits emerge over ‘living with Covid’ strategy and free testing, 17 February). Throughout the pandemic, national surveillance studies have provided invaluable information to support decision-making. For any real-time health surveillance system to be reliable and cost-effective, it cannot rely solely on self-reported tests. These data sets are likely to be biased, as it is impossible to know how many people are also reporting their negative results and, if tests start to come with a cost, how many people simply aren’t testing. If we are to get reliable information about the prevalence of Covid, it is essential to maintain studies such as the ONS’s and React to allow statisticians to estimate infectiousness and the proportion of the population who are infected (including those without symptoms), as well as to identify new variants.  Abrupt disruption of a surveillance system is wasteful, will make tracking of prevalence meaningless and will put in jeopardy the future health of the public. If important surveillance studies must be scaled down, this cannot be led by arbitrary cost-cutting targets, but should be led by statisticians to ensure that studies continue to provide reliable information.Prof Sylvia RichardsonPresident, Royal Statistical Society  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/19/2022,"Eugen Engel’s opera Grete Minde (Holocaust victim’s opera stored for years in trunk gets premiere at last, 14 February) is based on a short novel with this title by the influential 19th-century German writer Theodor Fontane. Generations of older Germans at secondary schools have read it as a set book and should be well acquainted with its contents. Fontane, whom some critics have described as the German Charles Dickens, wrote the story after he had researched real events that happened in Tangermünde in the 17th century. Fontane’s Grete Minde takes revenge on her bullying family by setting fire to the town. Apparently the libretto of the opera contains long passages of the book’s dialogue.  In Grete Minde, as in most of his novels, Fontane attacks the vices he detects in the bourgeois German society of his time: misogyny, dogmatism, injustice, envy and an ambivalent attitude to honour.Harry SchneiderMill Hill, London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/19/2022,"Fashion week is emerging from the Covid pandemic with a new look as a generation for whom upcycling is the new normal have graduated to centre stage: dressing up is back after two years of fashion tumbleweed, but the rules have changed. For 25-year-old fashion designer Connor Ives, ideas that spark his vintage-meets-streetwear cocktail dresses begin not in a sketchbook but in the Sheffield warehouse where he combs through old T-shirts looking for gems he can cut up and splice together into party looks.  “We spend hours picking through piles of T-shirts, and what we make depends on what we find that day.” On other days, Ives wakes up to 50 photos of vintage piano shawls, sent via WhatsApp messages from a dealer in Pakistan, from which he chooses the most interesting pieces to rework. “I want to deconstruct the idea that secondhand is somehow secondbest,” said Ives during a preview in his studio. “Personally, I always prefer a vintage T-shirt to a new one – it’s so much more romantic.” Secondhand clothes make up 75% of his raw materials, and the brand’s swing tags bear the motto “Things of Quality Have No Fear of Time”. Ives was headhunted by Rihanna to join her design team while still a student at Central St Martins, and already has a dress on show at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Exhibit in New York. But after two years of restrictions, his show on the opening day of London fashion week, in what was once Selfridges’ car park, was his first ever experience of the catwalk. In the 26-piece collection, a Paris tourist-stand T-shirt became an hourglass minidress, its curves tailored to the iconic outline of a glittering Eiffel Tower. Two grey marl sports team T-shirts were combined into a long column dress with a macramé fringed skirt. “Lateral design is a promising business model, because there are so many clothes in the world already,” says Ives. But using found objects presents a challenge to production. While customers can request a colour scheme when an order is placed, each of the dresses patchworked from old T-shirts or sewn from vintage piano shawls is unique. “It’s a different way of doing things, and the only way to figure out if we can scale this business is to try,” the designer said. One of London fashion week’s biggest moments will take place simultaneously on a catwalk at Tate Britain and in the metaverse. The fluid silhouettes and painterly colours of the Roksanda brand, whose sophisticated dresses have a loyal following among an art world clientele and on the red carpet, are far from an obvious fit with the metaverse, where the aesthetic is led by gaming and so far tends toward cyborg metallics and animal fantasia. In a link-up that reflects how seriously the fashion establishment is now taking the metaverse, designer Roksanda Ilincic has partnered with the Institute of Digital Fashion to create an NFT dress that will go on sale in a range of formats ranging from £25 for one of 500 3D renders, to £5,000 for one of 10 3D animation renders with software files that allow an avatar to wear the dress in the metaverse. “For me, the beauty of the metaverse is that anything is possible,” says Ilincic. “A dress that changes colour, or disappears and reappears – if you can imagine it, then you can make it.” She feels that resistance to the metaverse is likely to be futile. “I look at my daughter and I see can see that [digital] is clearly where her generation is headed. The metaverse feels a bit like how it was when e-commerce first started and the luxury industry didn’t want to know – and look how that turned out.” However, the designer admits she was taken aback by the complexities of producing the digital version of a dress that will feature at her show at the Tate gallery. “I thought that you would just press a button for whatever you wanted, but it’s much more complicated,” she laughs, adding that she hopes fashion can “infiltrate” the metaverse. “Fashion has so much to offer. It brings with it not just glamour but a history of design and creativity which can make for a richer digital environment. I would hope that the metaverse can become a place where many different generations and groups of people can find beauty.” A week of 86 live shows feels like good news for most fashion week goers, but Caroline Rush of the British Fashion Council is most excited by the 61 events that remain digital, believing that a hybrid model is the best fit for a modern fashion industry. “Designers are now really thoughtful about who they need to get into a room, and who they can speak to in other ways,” she said on Friday. Young Londoners in the tracksuits they wear to the barber shop were the inspiration for a lyrical and elegant hybrid show by Saul Nash, a 29-year-old who is one of the city’s most promising fashion talents. Nash choreographed dancers wearing his clothes in a short film set in a Kensal Rise barber shop, then invited a small audience to watch a live performance of the routine.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Fashion’s new generation puts upcycled and digital clothes on the catwalk,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/18/fashion-new-generation-puts-upcycled-and-digital-clothes-on-the-catwalk

2/19/2022,"Franki began living on Auckland’s streets at age 15, shortly after his father died in 2018. He hunted for secret spots to sleep – the backs of buildings and cemeteries. There were times when he was frightened; times when the older street community took him under their wings. He slept rough through New Zealand’s first pandemic lockdown, wandering the quiet roads, struggling to find food. There were few housing options for a teenager – rentals would not accept him, nor many motels. In mid-2020, worried for his health, he walked through the doors of Lifewise, an organisation that supports people into accommodation.  Since then, he has been on the move, bouncing between motels and emergency housing units. The constant disruption was difficult and tiring, he says. Two months ago – and four years after becoming homeless – he secured a spot in Lifewise’s new youth-focused transitional housing, a more stable but not permanent solution. “When I lived in the park, I didn’t have any goals. Now I’ve been here for two months I want to achieve my goals – to get a job, save up for a car and get my security licence,” he says. While it does give Franki a chance to reset, he is still in housing limbo. Lifewise will not evict him as long as he sticks to the house rules, but there is an expectation he will eventually find his own home. In the current rental market, that could take some time. Franki is one of the tens of thousands of people either living in emergency accommodation, sleeping rough, or living in cars, garages and on couches across New Zealand – people at the beginning of a long and distressing road to find a permanent home. New Zealand has one of the highest levels of homelessness in the OECD. As far back as 2018, Jacinda Ardern’s government pledged $100m to shelter the homeless population, following one of her party’s key 2017 campaign promises to tackle the housing crisis. Then, at the start of the pandemic, New Zealand made headlines for appearing to eliminate sleeping rough – it invested millions of dollars and resources into moving people into accommodation as the country closed its borders and its citizens locked down. But in the nearly two years since, applications for public housing have jumped by 8,000. There are now more than 25,500 households waiting for a home, with 89% of those in significant and urgent need. Among these are more than 10,000 people living in emergency accommodation such as motels, while another 5,226 households are waiting to be transferred out of public housing that is no longer appropriate. New Zealand’s definition of homelessness includes people in temporary accommodation, so while more people may be off the streets, the number of people deemed homeless is growing. “I really struggle when I hear language like ‘we solved the housing crisis in New Zealand’,” says Helen Robinson, the Auckland City Mission chief executive, “because all we’ve done is transfer [people], by and large, to emergency accommodation, and that’s just not appropriate or [a] good place for people to live permanently.” For many New Zealanders, that reality is grim, as the cost of living increases. Housing affordability is at a record low, with the average property now worth 8.8 times the average household income, according to property analysts CoreLogic. For those households, it would take nearly 12 years to save enough money for a deposit. Nationally, the average house price is NZ$1.1m (US$740,000; £540,000) – up by $300,000 from the start of the pandemic, according to Quotable Value’s latest index. A ministry of business innovation and employment report for December 2021 shows median rents nationwide have reached $540 a week, up by $50 from the previous year. Meanwhile, a single person on minimum wage takes home roughly $678 after tax, and inflation has hit a three-decade high. The Salvation Army says the situation has morphed into a housing catastrophe. In its State of the Nation report released this week, it said the term “housing crisis” has become commonplace. “Maybe it is time – after looking at these housing supply, affordability and debt challenges – to consider elevating the term to something more than ‘crisis’, possibly towards ‘catastrophic levels’,” it said. Services, like the Auckland City Mission, are struggling to keep up with the ever-swelling need. In 2021, it distributed 50,000 food parcels – triple the number prior to the pandemic. “We have an incredibly low unemployment rate here relatively, but what we’re actually seeing is a growth [in the number of] people who have inadequate income,” Robinson says. Aaron Hendry, the youth coordinator at Lifewise, says the organisation is in touch with 60-70 young people in Auckland, like Franki, aged 14-25 years old who are either sleeping rough, living in “toxic and unhealthy environments” or are being shuffled between emergency accommodation. “That number is growing every day.” Monte Cecilia Housing Trust’s waitlist has grown from 12-15 families in 2017, to between 300 and 400 families in the last year. “I think while the government’s done a brilliant job at keeping the nation safe, sadly, I think homelessness and other economic issues have gone to the background, and we’ve lost a bit of traction,” its chief executive, Bernie Smith, says. “Whānau [families] that are feeling incredibly vulnerable, who are living in a temporary environment, need some sense that there is a hope and a future outside of all that’s occurring at the moment.” Now, as an Omicron outbreak takes off, the services that assist those facing housing and food deprivation are worried about how both staff and the people they support will cope. Many families are still living in overcrowded housing, even if they have been placed in emergency accommodation, Hendry says. “The ability to actually isolate in those spaces is going to be an extra challenge for those whānau.” Robinson adds: “People who are vulnerably housed … their physical and mental health is so compromised. People are suffering the reality of structural injustice, the impacts of long-term poverty, the impacts of long-term trauma, and then you’re adding a pandemic on top of it.” Robinson worries that the phased reopening of New Zealand’s borders will mean motels being used for emergency accommodation could slip out of reach, as businesses swivel back to tourists and international students. In a statement, the minister for social development and employment, Carmel Sepuloni, said the ministry was aware of the potential for pressure on motel demand once the international borders open, but that it is “constantly monitoring the situation”. “However, they have no current indication that motels are intending to stop offering emergency accommodation,” she said. “Across government, there is a wider program of work under way aimed at increasing the supply of public housing and improving housing affordability and supply. “This is the best solution to removing the ongoing need for emergency housing, but it will take time.”",News/World news,"New Zealand’s homeless have been moved off the streets, but the crisis endures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/19/new-zealands-homeless-have-been-moved-off-the-streets-but-the-crisis-endures
2/19/2022,"Donald Trump and his two eldest children have been ordered by a New York judge to appear for a deposition within 21 days, as part of an investigation into the Trump family finances. The development presents the former US president with a dilemma: should he invoke his right to silence by pleading the fifth?  The right of any person to decline to answer questions put to them in criminal proceedings flows from the fifth amendment of the US constitution (hence “pleading the fifth”). The amendment, dating back to 1791, protects individuals from self-incrimination. “Nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,” it says. Technically, the financial investigation into the alleged fraudulent accounting of the Trump Organization is being conducted by Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, as a civil case, and as such is not covered by the right to silence. There is a complication, though – James has made clear that she is working in unison with the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg, who is also looking into Trump finances but as a criminal matter. On Thursday, hours before Judge Arthur Engoron ruled that Trump and his children Donald Jr and Ivanka had to present themselves for questioning, the former president’s lawyers protested that he was being put in an impossible bind. Alina Habba, one of Trump’s legal team, told the court: “They either disclose evidence in a civil investigation or they have to invoke the constitutional right not to testify, thereby triggering an adverse inference in the civil action. How is that fair, your honour?” In law, not at all. US law could not be clearer. Invoking your right not to answer a question in a criminal case says nothing about your guilt, and no inference may be drawn from it. The supreme court has underlined that point several times. For instance, in the 2001 ruling Ohio v Reiner, the justices stated that “one of the fifth amendment’s basic functions is to protect innocent persons who might otherwise be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances”. Of course, what the law says is not the end of the calculation. Witnesses have to weigh up how a jury might respond were the case to go to civil trial, as Trump’s might. If you are a politician like Trump, there is also the vexed issue of public opinion. Absolutely. There is a track record for this. Trump’s younger son Eric, the executive vice-president of the Trump Organization, has already been called before the James inquiry to answer questions about whether the family business misleadingly or fraudulently valued its assets to secure loans or pay lower taxes. Eric Trump pleaded the fifth no fewer than 500 times. Allen Weisselberg, the company’s chief financial officer, also invoked his right to remain silent hundreds of times. To plead or not to plead the fifth is an especially fraught question for the former president. His lawyers know that he has a tendency to wander off script, which may be fine at a campaign rally surrounded by supporters but is not a good idea if you are facing a dagger-sharp inquisitor like James. Trump has invoked his fifth amendment rights in the past. The investigative reporter Wayne Barrett chronicled how in 1990 Trump declined to answer 97 questions, many about adultery, during his bitter divorce from his first wife, Ivana Trump. On the other hand, remaining silent could make him look weak and hypocritical. Trump has gone on the record several times denouncing those who invoke their fifth amendment rights. At a campaign stop in Iowa during the 2016 presidential race, he said: “The mob takes the fifth. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the fifth amendment?” In 2014, he offered the disgraced comic Bill Cosby “some free advice” in a tweet. He said: “If you are innocent, do not remain silent. You look guilty as hell!”",News/US news,What does it mean to ‘plead the fifth’ – and will Donald Trump do it?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/18/what-is-the-fifth-amendment-donald-trump-deposition-explainer-plead-the-5th
2/19/2022,"Having Covid-19 puts people at a significantly increased chance of developing new mental health conditions, potentially adding to existing crises of suicide and overdoses, according to new research looking at millions of health records in the US over the course of a year. The long-term effects of having Covid are still being discovered, and among them is an increased chance of being diagnosed with mental health disorders. They include depression, anxiety, stress and an increased risk of substance use disorders, cognitive decline, and sleep problems – a marked difference from others who also endured the stress of the pandemic but weren’t diagnosed with the virus.  “This is basically telling us that millions and millions of people in the US infected with Covid are developing mental health problems,” said Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the VA St Louis Healthcare System and senior author of the paper. “That makes us a nation in distress.” The higher risk of mental health disorders, including suicidal ideation and opioid use, is particularly concerning, he said. “This is really almost a perfect storm that is brewing in front of our eyes – for another opioid epidemic two or three years down the road, for another suicide crisis two or three years down the road,” Al-Aly added. These unfolding crises are “quite a big concern”, said James Jackson, director of behavioral health at Vanderbilt University’s ICU Recovery Center, who was not involved with this study. He is also seeing patients whose previous conditions, including anxiety, depression and opioid use disorder, worsened during the pandemic. Research like this shows the clear need to follow patients in the weeks and months after even mild Covid diagnoses and to seek quick treatment for any emerging disorders, the experts said. “If we apply attention to it now and nip it in the bud, we could literally save lives,” Al-Aly said. More than 18% of Covid patients developed mental health problems, compared with 12% of those who did not have Covid, according to the study published on Wednesday. The study followed more than 153,000 patients who tested positive for Covid in the Veterans Affairs health system between March 2020 and January 2021, and compared them with other health records: to 5.8 million people who did not test positive in that time, but lived through the same stresses of the pandemic, and with 5.6 million patients seen before the pandemic. Among all patients who developed new mental health problems during the pandemic, the Covid patients were significantly more likely to develop cognitive problems (80%), sleep disorders (41%), depression (39%), stress (38%), anxiety (35%) and opioid use disorder (34%), compared with those who didn’t have Covid. The study looked only at patients with no history of mental health diagnoses in the past two years. It compared those hospitalized for Covid versus other illnesses, and compared outcomes to thousands of flu cases. The study also adjusted for factors like demographics, other health conditions and other factors. The results were all clear: Covid has a marked effect on mental health. Those with more severe cases of Covid, especially those who need to be hospitalized, tend to be at higher risk. But even those with mild or asymptomatic cases were more likely to receive mental health diagnoses. “People who were hospitalized had it worse, but the risk in non-hospitalized [patients] is significant and absolutely not trivial – and that represents the majority of people in the US and the world,” Al-Aly said. The study did have some limitations: most of those analyzed were older white men. But controlling for race, gender and age found no changes in risk. The coronavirus can be found in the brain, other studies have shown. “We can actually see the virus in the amygdala, in the hippocampus – the very centers responsible for regulating our moods, regulating our emotions,” Al-Aly said. The study adds to other research showing that “mental health issues are a huge concern” after Covid, Jackson said. And the results line up with what he sees among patients. “We’re learning that Covid may be even more problematic and more impactful than we thought,” Jackson said. Early treatment of patients facing new or additional mental health challenges after Covid can make a crucial difference, the experts said. “The idea here is to identify patients’ data early to hopefully reduce this from becoming a much larger problem down the road,” Al-Aly said. “If you leave a disease unattended, it only gets worse.” But the longer the virus continues circulating, the more long-term problems it may create – adding even greater pressure to health systems. “The wave of people with mental health disorders is going to be hitting the clinics in the next year or two or three, as a result of Covid and as a result of the pandemic,” Al-Aly said. And many mental health practitioners don’t accept insurance, creating a large stumbling block for patients, while others have long waiting lists. “This is a gigantic problem, and I’m not really sure what we’re going to do about it,” Jackson said. “The needs are vastly greater than the resources.” Jackson has set up peer support groups to offer counseling to patients dealing with long Covid – brain fog, cognitive impairment, memory problems, feelings of inadequacy. The groups are held on Zoom, so patients can join from all over the country. “We need to pay attention to the long-term consequences of Covid,” Al-Aly said. “If we only pay attention to the short-term consequences, the first 30 days or the first 90 days, we really, really are missing the larger picture. “The pandemic itself caught the US unprepared, and we’re going to be caught unprepared again for long Covid,” Al-Aly said. “The reality is that Covid is producing long-term consequences, and we cannot just wish it away or sweep it under the rug or not deal with it.”",News/World news,"Covid infection increases risk of mental health disorders, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/covid-infection-increases-risk-mental-health-disorder-study

2/19/2022,"My friend Laurens Otter, who has died aged 91, was a committed peace activist. Originally active in the Peace Pledge Union in the 1950s, Laurens joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament on its creation, attending the first Aldermaston march in 1958. Throughout the late 50s and 60s he and his wife, Celia, were arrested and imprisoned on many occasions. They spent their honeymoon in 1961 apart, in separate London prisons – Laurens in Pentonville and Celia sharing a cell with the campaigner Pat Arrowsmith in Holloway.  Among many direct actions, perhaps the most celebrated is the time Laurens was among protesters who tried to board the nuclear-powered US submarine Patrick Henry in the Holy Loch, Scotland in 1961. An aerial photo captured the scene with Laurens in his kayak surrounded by five naval launches and gunboats. Born in Montreux, Switzerland, Laurens was the younger son of British parents, Helen (nee Stephens) and Francis Otter. Francis, a railway engineer, met Helen, a gifted linguist, en route to India, where Laurens’s elder brother Robert was born, and the family moved again with Francis’s job. They returned to the UK when Laurens was still a boy, and he was educated at Marlborough college and at Trinity College, Dublin, though he did not graduate. In his youth he considered joining the priesthood. He retained a lifelong Christian faith and, despite his commitment to anarchism, adherence to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church of England. He married Celia Ball in 1961, and in 1971 they moved from Croydon, Surrey, to Wellington, Shropshire. Thereafter their house became a centre of radical thought and activism. My own political awakening began there, as did that of many others. Laurens had joined the Organisation of Revolutionary Anarchists on its formation in 1969. The following year they published his book An Introduction to Revolutionary Anarchism. He remained a revolutionary anarcho-syndicalist, though seldom a member of any particular group. In the 70s Laurens was active in the local Ramblers Association and a founder of Wrekin Against Racism. He was instrumental in forming Telford Anti-Nuclear Alliance and, as a friend of the murdered activist Hilda Murrell, published the pamphlet The Arrogance of Uncontested Power in the mid-80s, blaming the security services for her death. Laurens helped found the Wellington Civic Society, for which in 1992 he wrote the book Wellington: A Town With a Past.

2/19/2022,"The leaders of pro-Russian proxy states in eastern Ukraine announced a mass evacuation of citizens to Russia on Friday evening, amid fears that Moscow is manufacturing tension in the region to provide a pretext for renewed military intervention in Ukraine. After the evacuation announcement, warning sirens sounded in Donetsk and other cities in the two Moscow-backed statelets, supposedly due to an upcoming Ukrainian military assault on the region.  On Friday evening the Russian-separatist authorities said a car had been blown up near their government building in the centre of Donetsk. There were no reports of casualties and a video seemed to show that it was in an empty car park. Vladimir Putin swiftly dispatched a top official to the border region and announced that those arriving would be given a payment of 10,000 roubles (£95). However, Ukrainian officials insisted they had no plans to launch any assault, and said that, in fact, recent days had seen a dramatic upsurge in fire by Russia-backed forces across the frontlines. In Vrubivka, one of many towns on the Ukrainian side of the frontline that has seen an uptick in violence in the past two days, humanitarian monitors were analysing the damage on Friday afternoon and helping residents with repairs. Twelve buildings in the town were damaged by incoming artillery fire on Thursday, the first time the town has been hit since August 2018. “I just hope there isn’t going to be any more of this. I can’t sleep at night. My arms and legs are shaking, and it’s scary,” said Anatoly Romanenko, 77, whose roof was damaged in the attacks. There have been reports of incoming fire along the whole length of the line of control, which was frozen in place by a 2015 ceasefire after a bloody conflict between Kyiv’s forces and separatists armed and funded by Moscow. For the past seven years locals on both sides of the frontlines have got used to what is known here as “badminton” – the sporadic exchange of fire across the front. The events of this week have seemed different, however. Daily reports by international monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe have shown a massive increase in both ceasefire violations and recorded explosions over the past two days, while the Ukrainian army has claimed that the separatist ceasefire violations have been more numerous than at any time in the past three years. Ukrainian officials insist the uptick in violence originates with the separatists and is a cynical attempt to goad Kyiv into a response and provide a pretext for a Russian attack. Russia has moved more than 150,000 troops to various areas around Ukraine’s border. Russian officials have dismissed concerns over the troop buildup as western hysteria, but have also suggested the troops may only be stood down if western capitals accede to Moscow’s demands for a new security architecture in Europe. US intelligence agencies have warned that Moscow may seek to manufacture a false-flag incident as a pretext for intervention. Along the line of control it is often hard to tell exactly where incoming fire originated, and plenty of rumours and doctored photographs have appeared online, adding to the confusion. On Thursday morning some pro-Russian Twitter accounts posted photographs of a damaged kindergarten, supposedly inside separatist territory and hit by Ukrainian forces. In fact, the kindergarten was in Stanytsia Luhanska, in Ukrainian territory. In Vrubivka, too, incoming fire landed just metres away from the local school at a time when 37 children aged between six and 11 were in lessons. “Unfortunately, we don’t have a cellar, but we heard the first noises, the teachers quickly took all the children and rushed them into the corridor where there are no windows, and got them all to lie on the floor,” said the headteacher, Elena Yaryna. “Then we felt the close-up hit, the building shook and we could hear smashed glass. There was real hysteria, the children were all screaming,” she said. Nobody was injured in the attack. There appears to be little military rationale for some of the attacks, adding to the sense that they may be designed simply to provoke a response. Locals in Vrubivka said there were no Ukrainian military positions or installations in the vicinity. Local residents wonder whether the constant warnings of approaching war on television will lead to a renewed hot phase of the conflict that has blighted their lives for the past eight years. Valentyna Melnychenko, 72, saw her kitchen annexe pulverised on Thursday morning as she sat watching television. Her husband had built it before he died recently. On Friday she wept in despair, saying she was lonely and scared. Meanwhile, Russia’s proxies in eastern Ukraine stepped up their claims of an imminent Ukrainian attack on Friday with the evacuation announcement. There has been no evidence that Ukraine is planning such an offensive, which would be an exceedingly risky gambit at a time when Ukraine’s borders are surrounded by Russian troops. Instead, the separatist evacuation sparked fears that it could be part of a plan to trigger a Russian intervention in Ukraine. In a video address on Friday, Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, said he believed the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was planning to launch an offensive against the separatist areas. Pushilin said he was organising a “mass, centralised departure of the population to the Russian Federation. Women, children and elderly people are subject to evacuation first.” The Luhansk People’s Republic, another Russian-backed separatist state, announced similar plans. Local residents received text messages with a warning about the evacuation, the Mash Telegram channel reported. “Attention! Citizens! An emergency evacuation has been announced! Stay calm, do not give in to panic! Inform your neighbours of this information!” Video from the region showed that several cities had activated air raid sirens. Photographs from Donetsk posted by Russian news agencies showed cars lined up for petrol, people queueing at ATMs to take out cash and a number of private buses queueing for the evacuation, which was set to begin on Friday evening. Ukraine immediately denied Pushilin’s claims, as well as others in Russian-backed media that claimed the Ukrainian army was targeting a chemical facility. “We categorically refute Russian disinformation reports on Ukraine’s alleged offensive operations or acts of sabotage in chemical production facilities,” said Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister.",News/World news,Pro-Russian separatists order mass evacuation of eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/pro-russian-separatist-order-mass-evacuation-eastern-ukraine-fear-moscow-seeking-create-pretext-invasion
