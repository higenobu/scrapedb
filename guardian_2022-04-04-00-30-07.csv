4/4/2022,"Tristan GooleySceptre, £10.99, pp384 (paperback) Trying to divine what the weather might do without the use of an app almost seems the stuff of magic these days. Tristan Gooley, however, is a wonderfully enthusiastic guide to how we can all learn how to understand the weather simply by looking and feeling, smelling and touching. The sections on microclimates and how the weather relates to the land around us are scientifically rigorous and accessible. This is one of those books that makes you look at your environment in a different, more poetic way. Pierre Jarawan (translated by Elisabeth Lauffer)World Editions, £12.99, pp472 The follow-up to Jarawan’s well-regarded debut, The Storyteller, finds the German-Lebanese author back in Beirut, initially during the Arab spring of 2011. The unrest triggers his protagonist Amin’s memories about – and feelings towards – a country that he both loves and fears. There’s a well-crafted balance to Jarawan’s approach, the dropping of bombs and corruption leavened by the poignant, intimate and thoughtful depiction of a family trying to navigate a way through the lasting trauma. Elisabeth Lauffer’s translation from German is moving yet urgent. Giles TremlettApollo, £25, pp304 Tremlett’s previous books on Spain have taken specific events or historical figures as a prism by which to understand the country. Here, he attempts something far more ambitious – a brief but complete history of Spain. By focusing on the intricate details of its diverse people, Tremlett explores the tensions and myths that resonate across the centuries, finding a country unique in its lack of a national narrative because of its many identities. He’s a fascinating socio-cultural guide, as happy to discuss Spain’s World Cup win as its Moorish rule.

4/4/2022,"Children and young people who are anxious, depressed or are self-harming are being denied help from swamped NHS child and adolescent mental health services, GPs have revealed. Even under-18s with an eating disorder or psychosis are being refused care by overstretched CAMHS services, which insist that they are not sick enough to warrant treatment. In one case, a crisis CAMHS team in Wales would not immediately assess the mental health of an actively suicidal child who had been stopped from jumping off a building earlier the same day unless the GP made a written referral. In another a CAMHS service in eastern England declined to take on a 12-year-old boy found with a ligature in his room because the lack of any marks on his neck meant its referral criteria had not been met. The shocking state of CAMHS care is laid bare in a survey for the youth mental health charity stem4 of 1,001 GPs across the UK who have sought urgent help for under-18s who are struggling mentally. CAMHS teams, already unable to cope with the rising need for treatment before Covid struck, have become even more overloaded because of the pandemic’s impact on youth mental health. The findings, which stem4 hs shared with the Guardian, also show that in some areas it takes children and young people two years after being referred by their GP to start receiving help. Mental health experts say young people’s widespread inability to access CAMHS care is leading to their already fragile mental health deteriorating even further and them then self-harming, dropping out of school, feeling uncared for and having to seek help at A&E. “As a clinician it is particularly worrying that children and young people with psychosis, eating disorders and even those who have just tried to take their own life are condemned to such long waits”, said Dr Nihara Krause, a consultant clinical psychologist who specialises in treating children and young people and who is the founder of stem4. “It is truly shocking to learn from this survey of GPs’ experiences of dealing with CAMHS services that so many vulnerable young people in desperate need of urgent help with their mental health are being forced to wait for so long – up to two years – for care they need immediately. “Delayed treatment increases risk and you can expect problems in application to study or work, relationship issues, other emerging co-morbid mental health issues, for example depression, with increased vulnerability to self-harm, anxiety with panic attacks and so on.” Many GPs were scathing about CAMHS provision in their area. Some said problems accessing services means they are unsafe or even dangerous, because many under-18s get worse while they wait and can feel angry, overlooked and let down by being left without specialist help. Almost one in five (18%) of doctors surveyed knows of a patient who has tried to, or taken, their own life after being refused care. A handful of GPs said the situation was so bad that they had given up referring young people to CAMHS altogether and instead instructed them to go to A&E, even though that is not appropriate. One family doctor in Yorkshire and the Humber said: “It is so appalling in our area it may as well not exist. Patients only get support if their parents can afford to pay for it or they are drinking bleach, and even then it’s touch and go whether a referral to CAMHS will be accepted.” The findings are “deeply concerning” and show the immense extra pressure Covid has put on CAMHS, said Tom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds. “What these GPs are telling us echoes what we hear every day from parents, young people and professionals. Despite signs of progress in parts of the country thresholds for support are alarmingly high, with thousands of young people being turned away or put on long waiting lists. “Without timely support young people’s needs will often worsen, with many self-harming, dropping out of school or turning to A&E services in crisis.” Madders called for the creation of a UK-wide network of “early support hubs” so GPs have somewhere they can send under-18s to get rapid help. In one case CAMHS in the north-west rejected a GP’s referral for a child with anorexia for including inadequate information, even though their body mass index of just 16 was stated. MedeConnect Healthcare Insights surveyed 1,001 partner, salaried or locum GPs for stem4 between 4 March and 1 April and the survey was regionally representative. It also found that:  95% of GPs say that CAMHS services are either in crisis (46%) or very inadequate (49%) – up from 90% when stem4 ran the same survey in 2018 and 85% in 2016  Half say that at least six in 10 referrals they make for anxiety, depression, conduct disorder and self-harm are routinely rejected because the young people’s symptoms are deemed not severe enough, even though they only refer the most at-risk cases  One in four say that 60%-100% of referrals for eating disorders and addictions are rejected  63% fear young people will come to harm due to lack of treatment while 58% have seen patients’ symptoms worsen, forcing them to go to A&E Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the findings were “both distressing and concerning. He added: “It’s of paramount importance that if GPs refer these patients to specialist mental health services that these referrals are taken seriously and not dismissed without good reason.” The Department of Health and Social Care did not comment directly on the findings. A spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact the pandemic has had on everyone, especially children and young people who have faced disruption to their home lives and education. “We have committed an additional £500m in 2021-22 to support those most affected, including £79m for children’s mental health services, to accelerate the rollout of mental health support teams and expand community services. This is on top of our commitment to expand and transform mental health services in England, backed by an extra £2.3bn per year by 2024 allowing hundreds of thousands more children to access support. “We will be launching a national conversation to inform the development of a new long term mental health plan later this year.”  In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/4/2022,"Ramadan is here, and Muslims all around the world are starting a month-long spiritual bootcamp: days spent abstaining from food and drink, and nights passed in prayer and contemplation. Mosques brim with life as they open their doors to the young and the old, familiar faces and new ones standing side by side, reciting the same words as more than a billion others around the globe. This may be the first Ramadan in two years that we can be together in person, but our homes ache with the absence of those stolen by Covid, and for many this year, iftar meals will be meagre as the cost-of-living crisis takes its toll, with 50% of the country’s Muslims living in poverty. As Ramadan is celebrated in a nation more fractured than ever, it’s not just Muslims who could do with a little of its spirit. It is a common misconception that Ramadan is all about food. In truth, it is about starving the body to feed the soul. By temporarily depriving our bodies of what they need, we forge room for spirituality and introspection, generosity and discipline, to blossom in its place. Maybe we could all do with more of that in our era, where the self is supreme. Self-care and selfies, self-made and self-sufficient – we live in an individualistic age where the I comes before the we. The pandemic gave us a brief respite from that, as we clapped on our doorsteps and made small talk with the people we had previously ignored. But it didn’t last long. We were soon back to avoiding eye contact on the street, and passing homeless people by as if they were invisible. Ramadan forces Muslims to uphold the importance of community. We share food with neighbours, and give charity within our means: whether a smile to a stranger or cash to those in need. With the cost-of-living crisis so extreme that people are having to decline produce at food banks because they cannot afford the energy to cook them, imagine if it was the social norm to embody the Ramadan spirit and give so freely that, as the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, even your left hand doesn’t know what your right has given. Imagine if a family forced to choose between heating and eating opened their door to find a tray of home-cooked food on the doorstep, delivered by an anonymous neighbour.When poverty is inflicted by the state, manufactured through budget cuts and shifting policy, it falls on us to enact change. A famous Hadith reminds us that nobody can call themselves a Muslim if their own stomach is full while their neighbour is hungry. What if we all lived by this sentiment? Wealth distribution is fundamental to the Muslim understanding of social justice. We are obliged to donate 2.5% of our wealth above a certain threshold to charity. Can you imagine the potential for change if the world’s billionaires donated even 1% of their wealth each year? The focus for most Muslims during Ramadan is on praying and reciting the Qur’an. Many will gather at mosques for taraweeh (additional prayers during Ramadan) and recite the Qur’an into the early hours. Prayer has been replaced in our society by its more fashionable derivative, “manifesting”: essentially prayer minus God. Whereas prayer is about submitting yourself to a higher power and striving for self-improvement, manifesting is about speaking what you want into reality. But in our time of mass consumption, does everything have to be about what we want? The pursuit of meaningless things is destroying our planet, fracturing our societies, lining the pockets of the rich and enslaving the destitute. A small few consume so much that there isn’t enough for the many. Like the fasting person who has to control their temptation, maybe we could all benefit from curbing our insatiable appetite to constantly acquire more and more. When our body is starved of sustenance, our true nature reveals itself. Our anger, jealousy and greed are laid bare, and we are forced to grapple with them and overcome them. Popular discourse around self-care asserts that we don’t need to change ourselves – that if others don’t approve, we “cancel” them for our own contentment. But none of us is perfect: to err and to improve are what make us human. When everything revolves around the self, we stop taking accountability, striving to be better. Ramadan reminds us all that introspection is vital and healthy. Less “what do I want?” and more “how can I be better?”. Through embodying the core tenets of Ramadan, we are forced to examine how we can strive for personal and communal change. And in our increasingly hostile, polarised and unjust nation, we need that now more than ever.

4/4/2022,"Growing evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine are “a punch to the gut”, the US secretary of state Antony Blinken said on Sunday, promising that America would join its allies in documenting the atrocities to hold the perpetrators accountable. A retreat of Russian forces around Kyiv has revealed evidence of atrocities against civilians as Ukrainian troops and journalists have moved back into a broad swathe of suburbs and towns around the capital. “We can’t become numb to this. We can’t normalize this. This is the reality of what’s going on every single day as long as Russia’s brutality against Ukraine continues,” Blinken said on CNN’s State of the Union. “You can’t help but see these images as a punch to the gut. We said before Russia’s aggression we thought it was likely that they would commit atrocities. Since the aggression we’ve come out and said we believe that Russian forces have committed war crimes, and we’ve been working to document that to provide the information that we have to relevant institutions and organizations that will put all of this together. “There needs to be accountability for it,” he added. Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, echoed Blinken’s stance on the same program, saying the international community was sickened by the horrific images emerging from Ukraine, including the apparent execution-style killings of unarmed citizens. “It is a brutality against civilians we haven’t seen in Europe for decades and it’s horrific, and it’s absolutely unacceptable that civilians are targeted and killed,” Stoltenberg said. “It just underlines the importance that war must end, and it is [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s responsibility to stop the war.” Asked about holding Putin and Russia’s military leaders accountable, Stoltenberg said: “It is extremely important that the international criminal court has opened an investigation into potential war crimes, that all facts are on the table, and that those responsible are held accountable. So I strongly welcome the investigation.” Blinken said it appeared Russia was withdrawing forces from the Kyiv region, but he warned its military was likely preparing to strike elsewhere in Ukraine, or even planning to return to the capital at a later date. “It’s too early to say what that actually means because they could be regrouping and restocking and replenishing, and then coming back to Kyiv. It’s also very possible that what we’re seeing is what it seems to be, a focus to the east and the south,” he said. “[But] the will of Ukrainian people is clear. They will not be subjected to a Russian occupation, whether that’s in and around Kyiv or whether that’s in the east and the south. “Here’s the problem. In the meantime, the terrible death and destruction that you started with is going to continue and that’s why it is so urgent that Russia end this war of aggression, and we do everything that we can to support the Ukrainians.” Blinken would not be drawn on the details of US military aid being sent to Ukraine, but said the aim was “to make sure they have the systems they need”. “That includes many different weapons systems,” he said. “Let me give one example, between the United States and our allies and partners, for every Russian tank, there are or soon will be, more than 10 anti-tank systems. “That’s what’s been happening. It’s been incredibly effective because of the courage and bravery of Ukrainian forces.”",News/US news,Blinken: growing evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine a ‘punch to the gut’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/antony-blinken-russian-war-crimes-ukraine
4/4/2022,"It was, said Taras Schevchenko, like a scene from a film. At 6am on the morning of 24 February, from the vantage point of the kitchen window of his fifth-storey apartment overlooking Gostomel airport, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian town of Bucha, Schevchenko watched as about 20 Russian helicopters flew into vision, spilling paratroopers on to the tarmac below. “I felt as if I was in the movies, you know, I saw all the helicopters, I even saw the faces of those paratroopers.” This was the moment that the war began for Bucha, a town 35 miles north-west from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, which is swiftly becoming synonymous with the worst atrocities of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. The events that unfolded over the following days, Schevchenko, 43, said, were unimaginable. Bodies rolled over by tanks turned into “human rugs” while Russians shot dead even the elderly who got in their way, he said. Russian snipers shot the men who tried to escape across fields, it is claimed, and claims of the rapes and murder of young girls, which have yet to be independently verified, put terror in the hearts of those who remained. As witnesses have come forward, however, and photographic evidence of bodies on Bucha’s roads has emerged from the newly recaptured territory, the claims of mass war crimes by the occupying Russian troops appear to be all too real. On Saturday, AFP reported that 20 bodies, all in civilian clothing, had been found strewn across a single street, one with his hands tied behind his back and a white cloth and his Ukrainian passport left open beside his body. “All these people were shot,” Bucha’s mayor, Anatoly Fedoruk, said, adding that 280 other bodies had been buried in mass graves elsewhere in the town. Schevchenko, a martial arts coach in a kindergarten, and his mother, Yevdokia Shevchenko, 77, with whom he lived in the north of Bucha, recalls that it had gone quiet for three days after Putin’s troops landed. They talked about what to do, whether they should escape. Those few who decided to leave on that first day were seen as overreacting by the majority of those in Schevchenko’s block. The normality of those first 72 hours was an illusion. “We saw them [the Russians] on the third day when there was a massive shootout by our building with Bucha’s territorial defence. At first I decided to stay because I was thinking: where to go? I had nowhere to go. There was fear, you know. Secondly, we aren’t that rich to completely change our lives in one day. On the third day, I realised that it is too late to run away somewhere or change something because the war was literally around my house, on my street. There were tanks driving down my street. It is very frightening when they shoot, it’s such a sound, a roar.” By day four, there was panic. “Everybody was looking [for] some ways out of there on the internet, Telegram or Viber chats. Anyone who had their own cars just fled, risking everything. Our building has 69 apartments and there are only four families remaining.” Schevchenko’s mother, Yevdokia, terrified by the fighting on her doorstep, moved down into the block’s damp cold basement of just 20 sq metres, lit only by candles, where she joined eight other families, including one three-year-old child and an 86-year-old woman. Yevdokia would stay there for the next 13 days and nights, with only a bucket as a toilet. The older woman, Schevchenko said, may still be in the basement. “She hugged an icon. All the time she was there she was hugging the icon.” On the fifth day, the gas supply to the town was cut off. “People understood that we needed to boil water somehow or cook some soup or something and by the entrance to the building we made a kind of cooking place. It was just a campfire with two bricks on the side.” The conversations by the fire were filled with talks of the latest dead. “Dead bodies were just laying in the streets, they didn’t let us move them,” said Schevchenko. He recounted one killing, which could not be independently verified. “There was some grandpa, he was walking with his wife, they were about to cross the street, they were stopped by some Russians. You know how these old men are, just like to talk back and stuff. So they just shot him, and to the woman they said: ‘You just keep walking.’ She rushed to her husband and started crying, and they said: ‘If you want to lay next to him, we can shoot you too.’ She told them she needed to take the body, but they said: ‘No, just keep walking.’ And she kept on walking, crying and walking. It happened next to a McDonald’s, 30-40 metres away from my home.” The woman, distraught, approached Yevdokia and others who were standing nearby, struggling to catch her breath and tell her story, desperate to retrieve her husband’s body. “That old man aggressively said something to a soldier and they shot him dead, and ordered the woman to leave,” said Yevdokia. “I don’t know their names but I would see them around the town in a store, on a market, you know, familiar faces. When he got shot I was outside, I heard the gunshots. I had gone out of the basement to breathe some air.” By 9 March, Schevchenko knew they had to get out – but they appeared to be trapped. “I started to analyse all the possible ways to escape but I am glad I didn’t try then. Because other people who were braver than I was, fled and were shot. Some of them came back wounded but some remained in their cars forever, dead.” The following day, the Russians agreed to establish a humanitarian corridor for the evacuation of civilians. There was an exodus – but the Russians said they would permit only women and children to leave. “But we had neighbours one floor below and there was a man and I heard that he had managed to get out so I thought if he managed to do it, why can’t I? So, on 11 March, I woke up at 6am, and charged my phone. I found a place to charge it. Just a little though to 6-7%. Then I ran to the basement to pick up my mum. I remember very clearly it was 8.45am, I ran in and shouted: ‘Mum, we are running away,’ and at that moment there was shooting.” His mother’s first thought was for the family pet. “She said: ‘Did you get Mary?’ I said: ‘Yes, she is [in] my jacket.’ It’s a small fluffy dog, just 4 kilos. So we ran to the city hall for the green corridor. But at the city hall, they only let women and children through, so we decided that mum would go by a green corridor and I would join other men and we would walk to Romanivka, it’s about 12km away from Bucha, but you had to cross the river and peatlands and it was minus 9 degrees outside that day”. At 10am, Schevchenko started to walk, not on the roads, instead on the fields, with around 20 other men. Bullets started to buzz past them. Some went down, hit and wounded. Others, including Schevchenko, ran and tried to hide from what were assumed to be snipers. “We couldn’t even help the wounded because once you come close to someone who fell you can get shot too. There were fewer and fewer of us. I was constantly looking back and sideways. We didn’t care about each other and didn’t pay attention to each other. Just some animal instincts took over. I felt like I was a concentration camp escapee.” The route took them through Irpin, another town where alleged atrocities have been recorded since the Russians have withdrawn. Schevchenko made his way to the town’s central cemetery, through a forest there and then turned towards the village of Stoyanka leading to his destination of Romanivka. “The mayor of Irpin said the other day that they have collected 17 dead bodies,” said Schevchenko. “I can’t say there were only 17. There were way more. Lots of them were just sitting in their cars. Lots of them were laying on the sidewalks, there were a lot of them squashed by tanks. Like those animal skin rugs and the smell was unbearable. They were laying like that for 10 days or so.” For seven hours, Schevchenko ran, walked and hid, in the hope of reaching relative safety. “Then we saw our soldiers. They knew we were refugees, they just asked us to show them our passports and showed us the way. Buses were waiting for us.” Today, he has no idea how many of the 20 or so men who set off made it. “You know, not only did I not look, I forgot how to breathe. I literally forgot you could breathe through your nose. I was breathing through my mouth, my heart jumping out of my chest. My dog, in my jacket, was nervous and stressed.” He was taken by bus to Kyiv’s main railway station where he was reunited with his mother. “You know when I got to safety and some time passed, I felt like it was a prank,” Schevchenko said. “It just can’t be 15km away and it’s quiet. I felt like I was in the movie [The] Matrix. Like someone dragged me by my hair and threw me into this Matrix for 16 days and have been watching how I act. And later they felt sorry for me, pulled me out of there back to the peaceful world, patted me on my head and told me: ‘Good, you survived.’”",News/World news,‘It was like a movie’: recaptured Bucha recounts violence of Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/bucha-violence-invasion-russia-ukraine
4/4/2022,"Still the ace face 45 years after the Jam released their debut album, Paul Weller continues to uphold the principal tenets of the mod movement: abjure nostalgia, and be the snappiest dresser in town. Tonight he’s in mod’s spiritual stamping ground, Brighton, crackling through a set that endows Jam, Style Council and early solo material with the same implacable ferocity that marks his 21st-century songs. On the snappiness front, he’s done himself proud: white jeans and a slim-fit racing-green cardigan over a navy polo shirt. His silver bob swishes glossily as he shuttles from guitar to piano. Chronologically he’s an elder statesrocker; mentally, he’s as engaged as ever. Weller should have been here in 2020, touring his then-new On Sunset album. Eighteen months and two rescheduled dates later, there’s an even newer record, Fat Pop (Volume 1), represented tonight by its thrilling whomp of a title track. The delay has generated a craving to reconnect with a live audience; he and his five-man band march on at 8.30pm and don’t come up for air until 10.30. (“It’s a long set,” he promises/warns at the start.) Occasional remarks are slotted in – the Jam’s That’s Entertainment is preceded by a self-deprecating “If you know this, join in. It’s got a lot of verses and I’ve forgot” – but the gig is mainly devoted to making up for lost time. And he hasn’t forgotten a word of it, or of anything else. Despite a group that includes two drummers and longtime guitarist/foil Steve Cradock, Weller himself does much of the heavy lifting. He can slip into just-one-of-the-guys mode at will, getting his head down for a sultry middle section composed of 2017’s Woo Sé Mama, The Style Council’s It’s a Very Deep Sea and an acoustically strummed Rockets. But he’s most effective up front, vocals grainy, attaining lift-off through sheer passion for the music. Weller has no truck with fancy stage rigs – the only “visuals” are Ukrainian flags on the drumkits and amp, and (presumably sardonic) glitterball lighting during the swoony You Do Something to Me. That’s immaterial; what he offers is part firebrand, part sage, and needs no embellishment. At King George’s Hall, Blackburn, on 4 April.
