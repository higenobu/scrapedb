2/25/2022,"Actor Sean Penn is on the ground in Ukraine making a documentary about the Russian invasion, Vice Studios confirmed to Variety on Thursday, as Russia began a full-scale attack on its neighbor. The Oscar-winning star and longtime humanitarian activist appeared at a press briefing by the Ukrainian government in Kyiv on Thursday, listening to government officials speak about the crisis many world leaders are calling the worst conflict in Europe since 1945.  Penn previously visited Ukraine in November 2021 to research for the film. His visits with the Ukrainian military were documented by the Ukrainian joint forces operation press service, which posted photos of the meetups on social media at the time. According to Newsweek, Penn arrived in Kyiv earlier this week and met with deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, as well as local journalists and members of the military. The office of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a statement through the Ukrainian embassy in praise of the actor and director, who “specially came to Kyiv to record all the events that are currently happening in Ukraine and to tell the world the truth about Russia’s invasion of our country”. “Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in Ukraine today. Our country is grateful to him for such a show of courage and honesty,” the translated statement read. The statement also said Penn “is demonstrating bravery that many others have been lacking, in particular some Western politicians. The more people like that – true friends of Ukraine, who support the fight for freedom – the quicker we can stop this heinous invasion by Russia”. This is not the first time Penn has put himself in the center of a crisis. The 61-year-old actor directed the 2020 Discovery Plus documentary Citizen Penn, about the process of establishing his non-profit Community Organized Relief Effort, or Core, in the wake the devastating earthquakes in Haiti in 2010. Core also helped deploy teams for Covid-19 testing and vaccination during the pandemic. In January 2016, Penn published an exclusive – and highly controversial – interview with Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in Rolling Stone; Penn’s covert journey to visit with the Sinaloan cartel leader, who escaped from prison in 2015, contributed to his arrest by Mexican authorities. Penn later said he had “terrible regret” that his interview and 10,000-word article did not achieve its true purpose of changing the conversation about the war on drugs.",Arts/Film,Sean Penn in Ukraine to film documentary on Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/24/sean-penn-ukraine-documentary-russian-invasion
2/25/2022,"News of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shaken members of Canada’s Ukrainian community, the largest diaspora population outside of Ukraine and Russia. “I have a knot in my stomach. I can only imagine what it’s like for people in Ukraine who are living with the shelling,” said Taras Kulish, a Toronto-based charity lawyer and member of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. “We’re all concerned and there’s a definitely a shock factor in processing it.”  Announcing new sanctions on key Russian figures, Justin Trudeau on Thursday condemned the “horrific, unprovoked attack” on Ukraine. “We stand united and steadfast in our support of Ukraine’s sovereignty,” the prime minister said. “And we stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people’s right to decide their own future in a free and democratic state.” Canada’s sanctions will target wealthy Russians, large banks and members of the Russian security council, including the defence minister, the finance minister and the justice minister. Canada will also halt export permits to the country. The deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent, said Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine placed him in the ranks of the “reviled European dictators” who caused mass death and carnage in the 20th century. At times speaking in Ukrainian, Freedland also called on fellow members of the Ukranian Canadian community to show strength and to support loved ones affected by the war. “The Ukrainian people, like all people, must be free to determine their own future,” she said. “We know that the people of Ukraine … are fighting for us too. They are fighting for democracy and we stand with them.” Canada’s new sanctions comes after it previously pledged C$500m (US$780,770) in financial support Ukraine C$7.8m worth of lethal equipment and ammunition. For Ukrainian Canadians, news of the invasion has been devastating. A number of organizations across Canada are quickly raising funds for relief projects, organizing rallies and assisting those with families affected by the war. The prairie province of Alberta announced it would donate C$1m to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a recognition of the large diaspora population in the region– and the long history Ukrainian residents have farming the area. Kulish, who works closely with humanitarian organizations in Ukraine, says colleagues on the ground have described the surreal experience of shelling near their homes and the constant worry of loved ones. “I’ve been checking in with colleagues telling them we’re here. We’re praying for you. We’re looking to see what we can do in response. We’re trying to give them that knowledge that people are concerned about them and who love them,” said Kulish. “But you can’t imagine what it’s like. It’s almost unfathomable.” For the last eight years, Kulish has been involved in work providing trauma therapy clinic’s in the country’s eastern region. “We’ve been living this for the last seven years, so in one way, we’re terribly prepared for it.”",News/World news,‘A knot in my stomach’: Canada’s Ukrainian community shaken by Russia invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/canada-ukrainian-community-russia-invasion
2/25/2022,"The clues had all been there. The build up of troops on the Ukrainian border. The increasingly bizarre, stage-managed television appearances of Vladimir Putin. The movement of troops into the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Yet still there was a belief diplomacy and reason could somehow win through and that Russia would pull back from all-out war. That hope died early on Thursday morning when Putin launched a ground, sea and air offensive on several Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Just after midday, Boris Johnson delivered his own televised statement from behind a small table hastily positioned in front of a doorway in Downing Street. Presumably his office was too much of a tip for him to be filmed there. There was an early reference to Neville Chamberlain, who in a 1938 radio address had described the Sudetenland as “a far away country of whom we know nothing”. Johnson stressed that Ukraine was neither far away nor “a country of whom we know little”. But otherwise there was little of the Churchill tribute act that has characterised his recent Commons appearances.  Instead we got something more restrained. More hesitant even. As if even he couldn’t quite believe it had come to this and was uncertain of what steps to take beyond a vague aspiration to defeat Putin. He talked the talk. Bodies – not ours – would mount up and Russia would be hit with massive sanctions. Yet there was a dissonance. A disconnection. It was almost as if he was aware that these were desperately serious times and he needed a different persona to his naturally glib self. Yet he couldn’t conjure one that was entirely convincing. Johnson did rather better when he faced the Commons to make a statement on Ukraine in the afternoon. Possibly because he had had a quick lesson in statesmanship from a crisis management expert, though more likely because he had accepted a few home truths. This was one of the few occasions when it didn’t matter that most of the country didn’t rate him at all and believed his first instinct was always to protect himself. In a straight fight with a delusional, narcissistic dictator who had just invaded another country and had blood on his hands, the UK’s very own narcissist was going to win hands down. Put simply, Putin was in a totally different league of sociopath. So Johnson only had to stand up to look good. It also helped that this time, Boris actually had something substantial to say. On Tuesday, he had talked a good line about Ukraine’s independence and democratic freedoms only to come up with a list of sanctions that were about as effective as pissing in the wind. Five small banks and three individuals who had already been sanctioned by the US back in 2018. At the time, The Suspect had tried to make out this was part of a carefully graduated response, but he had clearly been taken aback when almost the entire house – the Lib Dems had been the most hawkish of the lot – thought the government was useless and it was only a matter of time before Putin invaded the rest of Ukraine. After he had recovered from nearly dying of laughter. Johnson wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. So he followed up his tough words on Putin with equally tough sanctions. Dozens of companies and individuals would have their assets frozen. Possibly even some that had donated to the Tory party, though that wasn’t made entirely clear. He also made it clear that the UK had been pushing the EU and other Nato countries to block Russia from the SWIFT international money transfer system. Something the EU and the US were so far reluctant to do. Maybe if things got worse... The Suspect was for once ahead of the curve. He promised to bring forward the economic crime bill next Monday, having promised it some time in the next session earlier in the week. He also even hinted the sanctions would hit the UK cost of living. For someone pathologically averse to telling people things they don’t want to hear, this was a huge step forward. Though not one necessarily to be repeated. Keir Starmer was also in his comfort zone. Relishing the chance to show that Labour could be trusted in matters of defence and security. So much so that he had threatened to withdraw the whip from the 11 of his MPs unless they took their names off the Stop the War statement they had signed. He too condemned Putin and promised to back all the sanctions. And any others Johnson happened to want to bring in at a later date. You couldn’t put a cigarette paper between Starmer and Johnson, and much of the rest of the session developed into a love-in with everyone falling over themselves to agree with one another in their determination to defeat Russia. Occasionally someone would seek clarification that people or businesses hadn’t been left off the sanction list and The Suspect duly wrote down their names and added them to it. Even the most hawkish seemed to have decided that Nato being militarily involved was a bad idea. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, just looked glum as he sat next to Johnson. Then maybe he was still kicking himself for making a twat of himself by telling the army that he would kick Russian backsides just like in the Crimean war. Anyone for The Charge of the Light Brigade? There were only two small moments of tension. Alba MP, Neale Hanvey, looked disappointed he didn’t get more applause for having persuaded his leader, Alex Salmond, not to broadcast on Russia Today. And Labour’s Clive Lewis had to be reminded that the time for negotiation was generally before an invasion, not after it. But otherwise it was all sweetness and light. Shame it takes a war to make politics this cooperative.",News/Politics,"Compared with Putin, Boris Johnson is a sociopath we can accept",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/compared-with-putin-boris-johnson-is-a-sociopath-we-can-accept
2/25/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been sent a questionnaire by the Metropolitan police over his attendance at a birthday party held for Boris Johnson while tough Covid restrictions were in force. The chancellor has not yet responded but has seven days to do so, and will be able to set out why he was at the gathering in a bid to avoid being fined £100.  It comes nearly two weeks after the prime minister received a questionnaire from Scotland Yard as part of its Operation Hillman investigation into a dozen alleged parties that may have fallen foul of rules on social mixing. Sunak is understood to have attended a gathering on 19 June 2020 in the cabinet room, along with the prime minister’s wife, Carrie, the interior designer Lulu Lytle and other Downing Street staff. A cake was presented to Johnson, but ministers have sought to dismiss the significance of the event. One, the Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, said the prime minister was “ambushed by cake”, while another, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the gathering lasted only 10 minutes. Sources close to Sunak have said he simply happened upon the celebrations, and believed it was inevitable he would receive a questionnaire given that he both works and lives in Downing Street. However, the Mirror reported earlier this month that police had obtained a photograph of Johnson holding a can of beer while standing next to Sunak. Scotland Yard has said that being handed a questionnaire is the equivalent to being interviewed under caution. All recipients of the form are asked what the purpose was of their participation in the event under scrutiny, how long they were there, who else was there and, crucially: “What, if any, lawful exemption applied to the gathering and what reasonable excuse did you have for participating in said gathering?” More than 88 questionnaires have reportedly been sent out so far, with the outgoing Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, suggesting earlier this month that “some – but probably not all – may very well end up with a fixed penalty notice”. The fine it carries is £100, though those who wish to appeal against it will see the issue referred to court. Sunak was asked several weeks ago if he was worried that the string of Downing Street parties had damaged public confidence in the government. He told the BBC: “Yes, I think it has. I can appreciate people’s frustration. And I think it’s now the job of all of us in government, all politicians, to restore people’s trust.”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak receives Partygate questionnaire from Met police,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/rishi-sunak-receive-partygate-questionnaire-from-met-police-boris-johnson-birthday-party
2/25/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has continued with Russian forces seizing control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and Russia’s defence ministry claiming to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields. Russian forces have attacked Ukraine on the orders of Vladimir Putin as world leaders warned that it could spark the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war. Within minutes of Putin’s short televised address, at about 5am Ukrainian time, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with Russia appearing to target infrastructure near major cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians were fleeing or preparing to flee the country with videos and photos on social media showing lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west. Ukraine’s president has said Kyiv would issue weapons to anyone who wanted to use them to defend the country’s sovereignty.  Western leaders have pledged far-reaching sanctions but the EU is wavering on banning Russia from Swift payment system, which is key to the movement of funds to Russia’s oil and gas sector. Meanwhile, European stock markets continued to tumble as the crisis fuelled a near-40% rise in gas price and pushed oil to $105 per barrel. The Russian central bank has bought millions of roubles to prevent the collapse of the Moscow stock exchange and prop up the currency after it plunged to an all-time low of 89.60 against the dollar. In Australia, Scott Morrison has promised “further waves of sanctions” against Russians, including hundreds of members of parliament, as he condemned Putin for the brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict is also likely to reignite concerns about Australia’s energy security with petrol prices at the bowser already north of $1.80 and headed to $2 as the expected invasion has added to global oil price pressures. The prospect of sanctions is hurting one of Australia’s largest alumina refineries, Queensland Alumina Limited, part-owned by a Russian firm. If you are struggling to get your head across the scale of the invasion, see this visual guide to the conflict. The collapse of construction giant Probuild could be just the start of financial trouble across the Covid-ravaged industry, the construction sector’s peak body warns. Probuild, which directly employed about 750 people and had annual revenues of more than $1.4bn, was placed into voluntary liquidation by its South African owners, Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon (WBHO), late on Wednesday. Contractors and other workers turned up at sites on Thursday in several Australian cities to collect equipment, including at CSL’s $750m proposed new headquarters in Melbourne. The Northern Territory government has been condemned for a “breach of trust” after NT police confirmed that spithoods and restraint chairs remain in use, despite promises to phase out the “inhumane” devices. NT police data reported by the NT News showed spithoods have been used 27 times since 2018 and 21 of those applications having occurred since 2020. The most disadvantaged areas of Melbourne have been hit hardest by Covid-19 deaths during Victoria’s Omicron wave, further underscoring the pandemic’s disproportionate effect on communities with lower employment and income levels, and poorer access to services. An elderly man who sparked a police manhunt when, acting out of love, he kidnapped his “sweetheart” from a West Australian aged care home has died in a car crash just two days after his partner died.

In Jamal Smith’s mind sits a tableau of family he’s never really known. From memories stretched by time, he grasps at fragments of an absent father, an abusive mother, cousins he knew as siblings, and a found family of friends he fears to lose. Jamal is the protagonist of Son of Sin, the debut novel from the prime minister’s literary prize-winning poet Omar Sakr. It begins in western Sydney, where Jamal is being raised by Lebanese aunties, uncles and grandparents – the extended family of his estranged mother, Hala. Guarded by religion and propriety, they keep the past hushed, and brand Jamal as different. But from whispers, the threads of their secrets unfurl, revealing the sprawling traumas that broke them apart.

2/25/2022,"From Thursday, people who test positive for coronavirus are no longer required to self-isolate by law in England. Free mass testing for the general public in England will end on 1 April. The change is part of the government’s new “living with Covid” plan, announced earlier this week, which will see the end of all pandemic regulations.  Five people share their reactions below. “I wouldn’t go out if I tested positive for Covid. I’d worry about spreading it to people who could suffer dire consequences. There’s still a high death rate and a lot of people who are compromised, who haven’t got much freedom to be on public transport or in the workplace. So if I knew I had Covid, I would certainly not go out and about with it.” “I have the luxury of taking that view, because my employer would accommodate it and I also have sick pay. It just worries me that other people won’t have that choice.” “I think, by and large, people are trying to be decent and mutually protect each other. In a way, we’re being exhorted to drop that but I think people will continue to do their best.” Kathy, 59, administrator, London I’ve been shielding for two years, but think I will be returning to the office part-time in the middle of next month. I am worried about people at work testing positive. The current plan is that I will be working a good distance from everyone else at a desk right beside a large window I can open. I will probably remain masked, too. But the problem will be after April, when people won’t know if they are infected. My greatest anxiety is about commuting on public transport and being in close contact with unmasked people. I also have to deal with members of the public in my role, but I have been assured that I will not be required to meet them face to face. My employer has been quite understanding so far and if the work from home guidance hadn’t been withdrawn then I think they would have kept me at home. Harry*, 34, working in local government, Durham, and who is considered clinically extremely vulnerable “I’ve not been testing and never have. The only time was when I came back from Spain because I had to in order to travel. I want to stress that I’m not antivax as I’ve had all my jabs. “It’s all madness. This ridiculous desire to test for Covid is insanity and has really affected people’s mental health and should’ve stopped a long time ago. If I’m unwell, whether it’s with Covid or the flu, I will just stay at home until I feel better. It’s the way I’ve done it in the past and I seem to have survived.” “I know asymptomatic transmission of Covid is possible but it seems to be very, very unlikely. The only time I would really have an issue with it is if someone came out with a streaming cold when they should be at home.” Norma, Cotswolds I guess I would fall into the more cautious spectrum, in terms of Covid. And so, I’ve been pretty careful all the way through. I don’t think I’ve had it, and I don’t think I would want to go out if I was ill, let alone the risks to the rest of the population. If I contracted Covid, I wouldn’t be wanting to pass it to anyone else. I wouldn’t want to pass any illness on to anyone else now we’ve gone through this. I received an email from my work today saying that, even though the rules have changed, the company will continue to follow the guidance. That sort of sensible, head-screwed-on approach is, as I see it, the way forward for the time being until something changes. Ben, 42, Bristol, works for a record label “There’s no way I would go out infecting other people, and I think everyone should be supported to make that choice. I just feel that it’s very unfair. We’re in a situation where we had children perhaps later than we would have liked, which meant we’ve been able to pay off our mortgage. We can make decisions that better protect my mother, ourselves and society. Others aren’t in that position. Statutory sick pay is just [under] £14 a day. Testing is going to be something that people have to pay for. People aren’t going to be aware that they’re positive, and they’re not going to be able to afford to stay at home even if they want to. The message is ‘just get on with life. It’s just like the flu.’ It’s clearly not. It’s clearly still causing a lot of damage. It just seems barbaric really.” Sarah, Nottingham, 44, teacher, and currently stay at home parent *Name has been changed",News/World news,‘People won’t know if they are infected’: Britons on the end of Covid controls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/people-wont-know-if-they-are-infected-britons-on-the-end-of-covid-controls
