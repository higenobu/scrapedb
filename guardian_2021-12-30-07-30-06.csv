12/30/2021,"For years, Ghislaine Maxwell operated in a social circle of the global elite so exclusive that its powerful members seemed insulated from meaningful scrutiny.  That circle was the world of Maxwell’s ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced late financier who for years sexually abused teen girls. Some of his victims were as young as 14. That world came crashing down when she was arrested in June at a hideaway in New Hampshire and charged for her role in Epstein’s crimes. Her fate was decided on Wednesday, when a Manhattan federal court jury returned a guilty verdict. But, though Maxwell’s fall came quickly and her time in court unfolded at speed, the stage for Maxwell’s trial was actually set decades ago, when she first met Epstein. Witness testimony during the case has painted a dramatic and intimate picture of Maxwell’s life and times at the center of Epstein’s world. Maxwell, the daughter of UK media baron Robert Maxwell, was a prime candidate for entry into Epstein’s orbit. She arrived in New York City in 1991, around when her father purchased the New York Daily News. Maxwell’s role was that of a polished liaison, to smooth the way for her father’s takeover of the paper. That summer, she became closely associated with Epstein. The Oxford-educated Maxwell was striking. She stood around 5ft 8in, with a slim frame and dramatic dark hair, and noticed for her “defined cheeks”. She was “well put together, pretty”, one former Epstein employee said. Longtime Epstein pilot David Rodgers recalled Maxwell as “very energetic” with a “great personality”. Maxwell had a posh English accent, likely enhancing her glamorous newcomer allure. In keeping with Maxwell’s worldly persona, she resided in a “very large residence” in the Columbus Circle area of Manhattan, on an “upper floor”, Rodgers said. On 5 November 1991, Robert died in a boating accident on his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine. “She was really, really upset. You could tell, this was ‘Daddy’s girl’. She was inconsolable; she could hardly speak. When she saw her mother, her knees just buckled,” Ken Lennox, then the Maxwell-owned Daily Mirror’s senior photographer, previously told the Guardian. “She was really devastated. If you look through the Maxwell files, he would take her to events: Elton John’s birthday, football matches. She was always there, clinging on to him. She called him ‘My Daddy’ all the time.” Following Robert’s death, news emerged £460m was missing from his companies’ pensions funds. The family’s reputation was in ruins. Two of Maxwell’s brothers, Kevin and Ian, were ultimately tried in 1996 for their roles in their father’s businesses. They successfully defended themselves against fraud charges. One or two months after Robert’s death, Maxwell moved from her impressive home to a studio. Epstein did not abandon Maxwell following her apparent financial descent. “Early on, they were romantically involved,” Rodgers said. Another one of Epstein’s former pilots, Lawrence Paul Visoski Jr, said of Epstein and Maxwell’s relationship: “I thought it was more personal than business.” Viskosi didn’t see them holding hands or kissing, describing them as not necessarily romantic but “couple-ish”. She was “on a lot of the flights.” Maxwell became “No 2” in Epstein’s hierarchy, with Epstein being “No 1”, tasked with handling every aspect of the financier’s life that didn’t deal with his businesses. Juan Alessi, the house manager at Epstein’s Palm Beach home from 1992 to 2002, gave an even clearer picture of when their complicated relationship solidified – and their level of intimacy. “Ms Maxwell was the girlfriend of Mr Epstein; I understand she was the lady of the house,” Alessi recounted. “From the day she came to the house, she right away took over, and she mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house. Also, she was in charge of other homes, other properties.” Others filled out that picture. “She told me lots of amazing things about her boyfriend and that she said he was a philanthropist,” said Kate, one of the four accusers to testify at Maxwell’s trial. Kate was 17 when she met Maxwell in Paris around 1994. Kate said that Maxwell first lured the then teen into sexual encounters with Epstein at her London townhouse, under the guise of giving him a massage. Maxwell “would ask me if I knew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey [oral sex] because it was a lot for her to do”, Kate testified. “She said, ‘You know what he likes: cute, young, pretty, like you.’ She said he needed to have sex about three times a day.” Photos of Maxwell and Epstein introduced at trial also show them enjoying romance across the globe. In one waterfront image, Maxwell has her arms around Epstein’s neck, and she is kissing him. In another, she is giving him another cheek-peck in a sunny town. One photo shows them posing close in black-tie clothing, another several show them side-by-side in fancy cold-weather attire. Several images show Maxwell massaging Epstein’s feet on his private jet, a giddy smile on her face. Maxwell seemed smitten with Epstein. In October 2002, Maxwell even appeared to write a gushing word document about them, albeit in the third person. “Jeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple for the last 11 years. They are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart – I almost always see them together,” read the document, which was introduced as evidence at trial. “Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun together. They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds. She grew up amongst scientists and in an academic and business environment,” the text continued. “Jeffrey and Ghislaine complement each other really well and I cannot imagine one without the other. On top of being great partners, they are also the best of friends.” Whether Maxwell was actually enamored or not, prosecutors contended that financial benefits motivated her involvement with Epstein. They tried establishing that despite her tony pedigree, she wasn’t particularly wealthy when they met. “While this horrific abuse was going on behind closed doors, the defendant was jet setting in private planes and living a life of extraordinary luxury,” prosecutor Lara Pomerantz said in her opening. “These girls were just a means to support her lifestyle, a way for the defendant to make sure that Epstein – who demanded constant sexual gratification from young girls – remained satisfied so that the defendant could stay in the lifestyle to which she was accustomed.” Kate’s testimony pointed to an enticing financial link between Maxwell and Epstein. “She told me that she owned her house in New York City, and that Jeffrey had got it for her.” Rodgers described how Maxwell’s residences changed over the time she was dating Epstein. Maxwell swapped her one-room flat for a “large apartment” then, around the late 90s, she had a townhouse on East 65th Street. “I believe it was a brown, five stories tall. It had a courtyard in the back of it,” he said. “It was a pretty big place, probably … approximately 6,500 sq ft, maybe seven [thousand]” And then there was the cash. Prosecutors called an officer from JP Morgan bank to testify about cash transfers from Epstein’s accounts to Maxwell’s. The banker, Patrick McHugh, walked jurors through documents which demonstrated that Epstein moved more than $30m to Maxwell’s accounts from 1999 to 2007. At some point in the early 2000s, Epstein and Maxwell’s romance ended. Cimberly Espinoa, Maxwell’s assistant from 1996 to 2002, said their relationship seemed to end around her last two years in the office. Maxwell started dating other men. She and Epstein stopped showing up at his Manhattan office around the same time. They no longer left together. Maxwell started dating Ted Waitt, the billionaire co-founder of Gateway Computers. This relationship shored up Maxwell’s social stature post-Epstein, according to the New York Times. Waitt’s “check-writing helped secure her place at conferences as they replaced benefit galas as the first-tier social gatherings of the late aughts”, the paper said. In 2007, Epstein brokered a controversial plea deal that allowed him to escape federal charges for child-sex crime allegations. While Maxwell was shielded by a non-prosecution agreement, she was not protected from bad publicity. This “wore” on Waitt and he and Maxwell split in 2010. But the tech mogul had given a minimum of $12m to Bill Clinton’s philanthropic foundation, which kept Maxwell maintaining a foothold with the former president’s family. Maxwell made connections at Clinton family summits, allowing her to start the ocean charity TerraMar Project in 2012, according to the newspaper. TerraMar had a website, and raised money, but didn’t appear to provide any grants, the newspaper noted. Then Maxwell’s position among polite society took another blow in the mid-2010s. Virginia Giuffre publicly alleged that Maxwell and Epstein forced her into a sexual encounter with Prince Andrew when she was just 17. Maxwell called her a liar, and Giuffre sued for defamation in 2015. They settled the lawsuit in 2017. Aside from some intermittent dialogue about these allegations, the scandal died down significantly until late 2018. That was when the Miami Herald’s Julie K Brown published an explosive series that renewed attention on Epstein’s crimes – and spurred outrage over his avoidance of justice. In July 2019, Epstein was arrested for sex trafficking. He killed himself in a New York City federal jail shortly thereafter, while awaiting his trial. Epstein’s victims, no longer able to confront him, were given an opportunity to speak in court. Five named Maxwell as a participant or enabler in Epstein’s abuse. Maxwell’s whereabouts immediately became the subject of immense speculation, and many wondered whether federal prosecutors would pursue her. These questions were answered one year after Epstein’s arrest. Manhattan federal prosecutors announced that she was apprehended and charged with sex crimes, conspiracy and perjury, in Epstein’s sex abuse ring. They described Maxwell as “slithering away” into hiding. Before Maxwell’s capture, however, she lived the high life on the run. She purchased the 156-acre estate in Bradford, New Hampshire that became her hideaway in an all-cash deal. Two real estate websites said this property sold for $1,070,750. It was described as “an amazing retreat for the nature lover who also wants total privacy”. Or, in Maxwell’s case, a disgraced heiress on the run.

12/30/2021,"The Premier League title may well have been decided in the same week as the Ashes. After Liverpool faltered at Leicester and Chelsea were depth-charged by Danny Welbeck, Manchester City enter 2022 with a fourth title in five seasons within their grasp. Victory at Brentford opened the gap to eight on Chelsea and nine on Liverpool with their chasers to face each other at the weekend. With Brentford troublesome opposition, City did not close out 2021 with a display of the glorious pyrotechnics that won last season’s title and had rattled in 17 goals in their last three matches. Phil Foden’s early goal, coming from Kevin De Bruyne’s assist, was all they required to escape west London with what they came for, a 10th successive Premier League win.  On a ground where Arsenal lost, Liverpool drew 3-3 and Chelsea squeaked a 1-0 win largely thanks to their goalkeeper, Pep Guardiola was not underestimating Brentford. The restoration to the starting lineup of Phil Foden and Jack Grealish after their pre-Christmas drinks session reflected the strength of City’s options. Drafting in Nathan Aké at left-back and picking Gabriel Jesus over the in-form Riyad Mahrez did though suggest 1 January and Arsenal were being kept in mind. Brentford have only been able to win one game a month since September and yet end the year well clear of the bottom three. The selections of Yoane Wissa and Frank Onyeka in midfield saw Thomas Frank plump for energy over the creative talents of Sergi Canós. Christian Nørgaard, their usual midfield screener, was also suspended. Facing a coach Frank had called the “greatest manager of the modern era”, was a team ravaged by injury rather than illness. Only one player, Vitaly Janelt, is currently on the Covid absentee list. Once a stadium-wide pre-match chorus of Hey Jude – also a staple at City’s home – had rung out, the champions dominated possession with the revived Kevin De Bruyne to the fore. They did not quite explode in the fashion of the 4-0 lead they surged into against Leicester on Boxing Day. A heavy surface – with long grass – at the Community Stadium, curbed their flow. Jesus’s 10th-minute mis-control was by no means the only suggestion of adverse conditions. Brentford were not completely restricted to their own half. Onyeka and Mads Sørenson took early potshots before Ederson was forced into a reaction save after Wissa had crashed the ball off the face of Rúben Dias. It then took a timely Aké intervention to clear the danger from a corner as Wissa again threatened. Within seconds of that 16th minute flurry, Foden had the ball in the Brentford net. De Bruyne delivered the ball from the right with top spin, in a style David Beckham patented, and Foden, onside by millimetres, slotted past Álvaro Fernández. VAR offered no mercy to Brentford. They had paid the price for pushing too far forward, getting ahead of themselves, and City’s main concern was what looked a muscle injury to Ederson after he had caught a foot in that heavy rough. The Brazil goalkeeper proved fine to continue, robbing Scott Carson of a chance to shine. City’s interchangeable forwards continued to threaten, Foden looking far more dangerous than Grealish, while Brentford, urged on by Frank squawking from the touchline, were reduced to last-ditch tackles. Dominic Thompson, on Jesus, delivered the pick of them. Just before the break, Ivan Toney and Fernandinho fought out a running battle. Both fell theatrically to the floor but neither engaged the attention of the referee or VAR. The second half began with De Bruyne again teeing up Foden, this time for a header that screwed wide. The Belgian then crashed a shot in with his left but failed to beat Fernández. Foden did manage to net a header, only to be ruled offside. Brentford were retreating ever backwards, pressed into mistakes on the rare occasions they did regain possession. There were cheers from the home crowd when the ball eventually appeared in the City half as Frank urged his men to push outwards. That appeared to loosen the pressure for a time only for City to step it up and De Bruyne’s low drive to rattle off the left-hand post with Fernández beaten. City were creating half-chances but Guardiola was getting worried on the touchline. His team were dominating possession and yet not enjoying the hustle and hassle Brentford put opponents through. That lack of a second goal opened the door on a late Brentford counter nicking a point and halting City’s winning run at nine matches, though the home team looked exhausted in the dying stages, with Thompson pulling up with cramp. Aymeric Laporte had the ball in the net late on, only for another offside decision to deny City. Guardiola appeared reluctant to make use of his bench, leaving Mahrez and Raheem Sterling in the stand. They will come in handy at the Emirates where City can further stretch their lead over their now distant chasers.",Sport/Football,Phil Foden volleys Manchester City to victory at Brentford and 10th successive win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/29/brentford-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report

12/30/2021,"Former British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial ended on Wednesday when the Manhattan federal court jury weighing her fate rendered a guilty verdict. It was a trial that captured headlines around the world and offered a rare and intimate look into the elite social circles that Maxwell and her former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein moved in, as well as the wealth and power that the disgraced financier wielded to help carry out his crimes.  The prosecution presented 24 witnesses, over the course of 10 days, to make their case that between 1994 and 2004, Maxwell lured girls as young as 14 into Epstein’s abusive orbit. Maxwell was present during some of the late financier’s abuse and at some points, she participated in his predatory misdeeds, prosecutors said. Maxwell’s defense presented nine witnesses over the course of two days in their attempt to clear her. They elicited testimony to undermine allegations of inappropriate sexual contact with minors – including calling Eva Dubin, a former Miss Sweden and Epstein ex-girlfriend, to the stand. They also called two of Maxwell’s former assistants to testify. Both described Maxwell in glowing terms, in an apparent campaign to make the British socialite seem more likable. Here are some key moments from the trial: While all of Maxwell’s accusers provided upsetting testimony, Carolyn’s statements were even more harrowing. Carolyn was an archetype of vulnerability when she met Maxwell at age 14 – with an alcoholic mother at home, a 17-year-old boyfriend and a history of sexual abuse. Her boyfriend, Shawn, introduced Carolyn to then 18-year-old Virginia Giuffre, who has been among the most vocal Epstein and Maxwell accusers. Giuffre asked Carolyn if she wanted to make some money, giving a massage to an older man she knew on Palm Beach island. Maxwell subsequently scheduled sexualized massage sessions with Epstein. Carolyn’s voice broke, and she wiped her eyes, after saying that she went to Epstein’s house “over 100” times from ages 14 and 18. Sometimes, Carolyn scheduled appointments, saying she needed money for drugs: “Marijuana, cocaine, alcohol, anything that could block out … the appointment.” Carolyn wept when addressing the defense’s contention that she was testifying for financial gain, saying: “Money would not ever fix what that woman has done to me.” The exact nature of Maxwell’s role in Epstein’s life remains somewhat mysterious, but a cache of photos presented to jurors showed them as a seemingly enamored couple. The images included notorious snaps of a cleavage-baring Maxwell rubbing Epstein’s feet. There are photos of Maxwell giving Epstein cheek-kisses while they appear to be on holiday. Jurors also saw a photo of Maxwell and Epstein swimming naked. Showing Maxwell and Epstein as a couple and not just business associates was integral to prosecutors case. “Ladies and gentlemen, when you’re with someone for 11 years, you know what they like,” prosecutor Alison Moe said in her closing. “Jeffrey Epstein liked underage girls. He liked to touch underage girls. Maxwell knew it.” Visuals of the relationship was key to bolstering witness accounts that described Maxwell and Epstein as romantically linked, thus supporting prosecutors’ claim that Maxwell was well aware of what was going on. Kate, the second accuser to testify against Maxwell, had testified that she described Epstein as her boyfriend. Maxwell “would ask me if I knew anybody who could come and give Jeffrey [oral sex] because it was a lot for her to do”, Kate said. “She said, ‘You know what he likes: cute, young, pretty, like you.’ She said he needed to have sex about three times a day.” Prosecutors have argued that Maxwell’s motive in fostering Epstein’s crimes was financial. Maxwell’s father, the British publishing baron Robert Maxwell, died shortly after her arrival to New York City in 1991. Maxwell wasn’t particularly wealthy when she first got involved with Epstein. Satisfying his needs, however, got her back to the high life, they claimed. An officer from JP Morgan bank testified about transfers from Epstein’s accounts to Maxwell’s. This banker, Patrick McHugh, explained documents which demonstrated that Epstein transferred more than $30m to Maxwell’s accounts between 1999 and 2007. “You don’t give someone $30m unless they’re giving you exactly what you want, and what Epstein wanted was to touch underage girls,” Moe argued in her closing. “When Maxwell took that money, she knew what it was for and now you do, too.” Testimony from Alessi, the former house manager of Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion, painted a damning portrait of Maxwell both as his domineering consigliere and indisputable lover. “Ms Maxwell was the girlfriend of Mr Epstein; I understand she was the lady of the house,” Alessi said. “From the day she came to the house, she right away took over, and she mentioned to me she was going to be the lady of the house. Also, she was in charge of other homes, other properties.” Alessi’s words, by showing Maxwell’s deep involvement in Epstein’s affairs, strengthened prosecutors’ argument that she was so enmeshed with him, she had to know about his abuse. “You should never look at his eyes. Just look at another part of the room and answer to him,” Alessi recalled Maxwell saying. His specific recollections of Epstein and Maxwell’s intimacy further spoke to the twisted personal-and-business relationship that prosecutors said paved the way for abuse. “She was sleeping at Mr Epstein’s bedroom,” he said. Alessi once found a large dildo in Epstein’s massage room, which he then placed in Maxwell’s bathroom. “That’s the place what I was told – it was kept all the time.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

12/30/2021,"Four of Ghislaine Maxwell’s accusers testified against the British socialite at her Manhattan federal court trial, painting a compelling and powerful story of sexual abuse. These women – Jane, Kate, Carolyn and Annie Farmer – all testified they met Maxwell as teens, and that she lured them into Jeffrey Epstein’s orbit. While the dates and exact circumstances of their encounters with Maxwell differ, they all share striking similarities. Only Farmer used her real full name.  These four women all describe being vulnerable when they met Maxwell, such as suffering financial precarity or strained family relationships. They said that Maxwell made them feel comfortable before Epstein’s misconduct and that she made them feel special by asking questions about their lives. She served as a reassuring presence that tempered concerns or suspicions about Epstein. They all said that Maxwell was involved in Epstein’s abuse or misconduct. Three said that Maxwell coordinated their appointments with Epstein. Three said that Maxwell touched them. They all described Maxwell as working to satisfy Epstein’s physical needs. Accusers’ testimony portrayed Maxwell as an enabler and, in some instances, an enthusiastic participant. Here are their stories: In summer 1994, Jane met Maxwell at Interlochen Center for the Arts youth camp in Michigan. Jane, then 14, was eating ice cream with her friends when a woman “walking a cute little Yorkie” dog – Maxwell – approached. They started chatting and eventually a man, Epstein, joined them. They were interested in her time at Interlochen, telling Jane that they provided children scholarships. They learned Jane was from Palm Beach and asked for her mother’s phone number. Jane gave them her contact information and, after she returned from camp, they called to invite her and her mom for tea. After that initial tea, Jane started spending time with Epstein every week or two. Epstein first abused Jane when she was 14. Jane said that there were sexual encounters with Epstein for the next three years, around every two weeks. Sometimes, Maxwell was in the room during this sexual abuse. There were occasions when Maxwell touched Jane’s breasts, she testified. “There were hands everywhere,” Jane recalled of an encounter with Epstein and Maxwell. The second accuser to testify, Kate said that she met Maxwell around 1994, in Paris. Kate found Maxwell to be “very sophisticated and very elegant” and gave the British socialite her phone number. Kate testified that Maxwell invited her for tea. During this meeting, Maxwell gushed about “her boyfriend”, Epstein. Not long after their tea at Maxwell’s London townhouse, she called Kate and told her that Epstein was there, would she be able to come by and meet him? When she arrived, Maxwell told Epstein that Kate was “very strong” and told the teen, “Why don’t you give his feet a little squeeze to show him how strong you are?” She did so and “he seemed to be very approving and said, ‘Go ahead, you can do my shoulders.’” Epstein received a call and Maxwell shuttled her out of the house. Maxwell rang Kate a few weeks later, saying that Epstein’s masseuse had canceled, could she come over? Kate went and said that Maxwell led her up the stairs into a room with a table. Epstein was inside, sporting a robe, which he removed to be naked. Maxwell shut the door, Kate said, and Epstein initiated a sexual encounter. Kate said that Maxwell invited her over several days later, and that a similar encounter took place. Kate saw Epstein several times a year over the next few years. At 14, Caroyln’s 17-year-old boyfriend introduced her to Virginia Giuffre – a longtime Maxwell and Epstein accuser. “Virginia asked me if I wanted to come make money,” Carolyn said of their meeting in the early 2000s. Giuffre, then 18, said they would go to her friend’s house on Palm Beach island to “give him a massage”. When they got to Epstein’s house, Carolyn said Maxwell greeted them, telling Giuffre: “You can bring her upstairs and show her what to do.” Giuffre disrobed. Epstein came into the room and climbed on to the massage table face-down. They massaged him for 45 minutes and then he turned over. Giuffre then had sex with him. Carolyn later went back to Epstein’s house, without Giuffre, saying that Maxwell got her phone number and called to schedule massages. Carolyn said she went to Epstein’s home “over 100” times from age 14 to 18. Carolyn said that at age 14, before one of the massages, Maxwell “came in and felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said … that I had a great body for Mr Epstein and his friends.” The fourth and final accuser to testify, Annie Farmer said that Maxwell gave her a nude massage when she was only 16. Farmer said that she met Epstein at his Manhattan manse in late 1995. Annie’s sister, Maria Farmer, worked for him as a fine arts painter. Epstein bought the ticket for Annie. The first time Farmer met Epstein was to pick up Phantom of the Opera tickets he had bought them. Farmer saw Epstein again when she and Maria went to a movie with him. He sat between the two sisters. At one point, he “caressed” Farmer’s hand and touched her foot and leg. Farmer learned in spring 1996 that she would travel to see him again, for a weekend at his ranch outside Santa Fe, New Mexico. She wasn’t eager to go but felt slightly more comfortable because a woman – Maxwell – would be there. After returning to the ranch following an excursion to town, “it was decided” that Farmer would learn to massage Epstein’s feet. Farmer said Maxwell instructed her and that she followed along. Maxwell then asked if she’d ever had a professional massage. A massage table was set up in the room where Farmer was staying. “She said to get undressed and get [under] the sheet on the massage table,” Farmer said. “She pulled the sheet down and exposed my breasts, and started rubbing on my chest and on my upper breast.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

12/30/2021,"British former socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has been found guilty in her Manhattan federal court trial. Maxwell, 60, was arrested in July 2020, charged with involvement in ex-boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of teenage girls, some as young as 14.  Epstein, a convicted sex offender and presumed billionaire, counted Prince Andrew and former presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump as cronies before killing himself in a New York jail in 2019, about one month after his sex-trafficking arrest. The verdict marks a dramatic conclusion to an unexpectedly fast-moving trial: proceedings were originally expected to take at least six weeks. Prosecutors called 24 witnesses over 10 days, and defense attorneys called nine witnesses over two days. Prosecutors said that Maxwell “preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them and served them up to be sexually abused” by Epstein. There were four accusers in this case: Jane, Kate and Carolyn, who did not use their full names, and Annie Farmer. Jane testified that she was 14 in 1994 when Epstein started to sexually abuse her – and that sometimes Maxwell was present during this abuse. At times, Maxwell participated in the abuse, Jane said. “There were hands everywhere,” Jane recalled of an encounter with Epstein and Maxwell. The abuse continued when she was 15 and 16. Kate testified that she met Maxwell in Paris around 1994, at age 17. Maxwell extended a tea invitation to her London townhouse shortly after they met, and introduced Kate to Epstein at a subsequent meeting. Several weeks later, Maxwell called Kate, and said: “Jeffrey was meant to get a massage but the massage therapist had canceled. Could I do her a favor and come over … because I had strong hands.” Kate testified that Maxwell led her upstairs, where Epstein was wearing a robe. Maxwell closed the door, leaving them alone; Epstein initiated sexual contact. Kate saw Epstein a few times annually over the next several years. Carolyn said that she wound up in Maxwell and Epstein’s orbit around the early 2000s, when she was 14-years-old, at his Palm Beach mansion. Carolyn said she went to Epstein’s house “over 100 times” from ages 14 to 18, and testified about a physical encounter with Maxwell while setting up a massage table. “I was getting fully nude, and she came in and felt my boobs and my hips and my buttocks and said … that I had a great body for Mr Epstein and his friends. She just said that I had a good body type,” Carolyn said. Annie Farmer, the only accuser to testify under her full name rather than a pseudonym or first name, testified that Maxwell gave her a nude massage when she was only 16 at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch. Farmer met Epstein in late 1995, when she traveled to visit her sister, Maria, in New York City. Maria worked as a fine art painter for Epstein. In spring 1996, her mother informed the teen that she would be traveling to Epstein’s ranch, believing it was an educational retreat for high school students. Annie didn’t want to go – Epstein had touched her hand when they went to a movie in New York – but felt better knowing a woman, Maxwell, would be there. Following an excursion into town, Maxwell said she’d teach Annie to give Epstein a foot massage. Then, Maxwell said she wanted Annie to have the “experience” of a professional massage. “She said to get undressed and get [under] the sheet on the massage table, and I did,” Annie said, saying a table was set up in the room where she was staying. “She pulled the sheet down and exposed my breasts, and started rubbing on my chest and on my upper breast.” Maxwell was tried on six counts in relation to Epstein. She has maintained her innocence. Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

12/30/2021,"Having debuted with a one-off episode between Christmas and new year 12 months ago, Britain’s Most Expensive Houses (Channel 4) is back – raising the possibility that it will become an unlikely annual festive staple, like the Royal Institution Christmas lectures or World’s Strongest Man. Come, children! Let us gather and receive an update on the luxury real estate market! God bless us, every one! The show does offer cheer, of a sort. Because if you thought selling the nation’s priciest gaffs would require a team of intimidatingly suave and capable salespeople, Britain’s Most Expensive Houses is here to reassure you. At the very top of the estate agent industry are … just more estate agents.  Joining the cast this time around are broker Shereen and her enthusiastic new protege Leena. Can they find a pad for Harley Street beautician Anastasia, who wants outdoor space and a short commute? Their first thought is a quirky flat currently owned by a famous actor, in the “iconic” – as Arabella Weir’s narration insists on calling it – St Pancras Chambers. But Leena’s prep lets her down. That rainbow mural was painted by the owner’s friend, who is a … magician? Film director, Shereen gently corrects her. The wood for the kitchen units was rescued from a thunderstorm in … the 1600s? Shereen steps in again: it was 1987. Close enough. Shereen is the brains of the duo, yet even she fails to see that confidently appearing in front of a documentary camera with the words “Anastasia was blown away by the apartment … we’re definitely going to get an offer!” might not be wise. Cut straight to Anastasia explaining that this two-bedroom flat seems a bit pokey for £4.6m, so it’s a no. Meanwhile on the Llŷn peninsula near Caernarfon, Guy, managing director of UK Sotheby’s International Realty, the firm that has renewed its baffling decision to let cameras shadow its staff – is trying to convince a developer called Gary to invest in Plas Glynllifon, a 102-room, Grade I-listed mansion that needs major refurbishment. Gary, like many potential buyers during a pandemic, is unable to attend the property in person. He needs a virtual tour. Surely Sotheby’s have had a swish video filmed by top-drawer cinematic artisans? Nope, it’s Guy on his iPhone, wrestling with north Wales’s stubbornly elusive 4G signal. Halfway through his third attempt to tell Gary how big the place is – “It’s 110,000! Square feet!” – Guy loses reception. Absent buyers are also an issue for the agents selling a £30m country manor near Windsor, with its modern interior (everything’s grey or light caramel), seven-metre cantilevered kitchen island, and stables extensive enough to accommodate a moderately successful polo team. “First impressions are really quite … impressive, let’s put it that way,” says veteran salesman John, smoothly doling out more of the dazzling rhetoric we heard from him a year ago. So who will buy it? John’s colleague Mary is there on behalf of her contact, a French-Moroccan socialite named Boubakar. Mary met Boubakar in Dubai, has been cultivating the relationship for years, and knows what Boubakar wants, so she’s immediately taken by the first-floor office with its majestic Berkshire vista. “He just loves looking out at open space,” she says, clarifying that Boubakar is not one of those multimillionaires who prefers a terrace house with a view of No26’s wheelie bins. Not content with consistently presenting the Sotheby’s staff in a comically unflattering light, Britain’s Most Expensive Houses continues its insidious class warfare by not even giving them the consolation of a satisfying ending: all three stories fizzle out at the bottom of the hour. The legendary Boubakar fails to make it to Britain for a viewing and misses out on the Berkshire mansion, which means no commission for John and Mary. Guy does find a game moneybags who has the means to turn Plas Glynllifon into a seven-star hotel: it’s none other than Kam Babaee, who earlier this year welcomed Channel 5 cameras into his own Mayfair home for an episode of Sally Lindsay’s Posh Sleepover. Kam flamboyantly announces that he will make an offer but not how much it will be for, which feels like fairly crucial missing info. Shereen and Leena, meanwhile, end up selling Anastasia an off-plan flat in the desecrated shell of Battersea power station, which Weir – possibly just being sarcastic at this point – confirms is “iconic”. Anastasia’s keen on the idea of the riverside as an exclusive enclave, where the owners of multimillion-pound apartments live in expensive isolation. We don’t seem to be missing out on much.",Arts/Television & radio,Britain’s Most Expensive Houses review – a comedy of feckless estate agents,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/29/britains-most-expensive-houses-review-a-comedy-of-feckless-estate-agents
12/30/2021,"This time it was not even about Chelsea’s wastefulness. They barely created anything after taking the lead through Romelu Lukaku’s header in the first half and could have no complaints after this costly draw with Brighton, who thoroughly outplayed the European champions before Danny Welbeck came off the bench to earn them a deserved point in stoppage time. Brighton had done everything but score before equalising and Thomas Tuchel did not look particularly surprised when Welbeck’s beautiful header sailed past Édouard Mendy. Tuchel knew that his side had not done enough. Chelsea were too timid after going ahead and their hopes of catching Manchester City are surely over after their third draw in four games.  The problems are mounting for Tuchel. Ben Chilwell is out for the rest of the season and Chelsea could be without Andreas Christensen, Thiago Silva and Reece James when they host Liverpool on Sunday. On the plus side there was more confidence to Chelsea’s forward play after their win over Aston Villa on Boxing Day. Fit and firing at last, Lukaku was in the mood after scoring against Villa. Dan Burn, in particular, looked uncomfortable whenever the ball reached the striker and it soon became clear that Chelsea were intent on playing off Lukaku, the presence of a target man encouraging Mason Mount to keep making dangerous runs into space. Tuchel has been looking for those connections in attack all season. Under instructions to dart beyond Lukaku, Mount was a whirl of energy during the first half. The England midfielder almost broke through on the left during the early stages, only to mess up his final pass, and he would also see a low drive turned aside by Robert Sánchez after Lukaku had carved Brighton a part with a smart reverse pass. There was, of course, more to Lukaku’s game than clever link-up play. Rarely the most ruthless of sides, Chelsea are banking on the Belgian’s goals turning this type of game in their favour. Indeed, the tension had been building before Lukaku gave them the lead in the 28th minute. Brighton were doing a decent job of frustrating Chelsea, who had just seen James limp off with a hamstring injury, and there was sizeable relief when Lukaku shrugged Neal Maupay to the floor and met Mount’s corner with an unstoppable header. The goal stood despite Brighton’s complaints that Lukaku had fouled Maupay. It arrived at a good time. César Azpilicueta had struck a post after Sánchez flapped at a corner, but Chelsea certainly did not have it all their own way before the break. There was a nerviness in central defence with Silva missing and Brighton were quick to target Chelsea’s wing-backs, with Christian Pulisic unconvincing on the right and James given a torrid time by Tariq Lamptey before making way for Marcos Alonso. The problem for Chelsea was that Tuchel has been forced to experiment because of Chilwell’s knee injury. They are not as balanced without Chilwell at left wing-back and the experiment of using the right-footed James on that flank did not work. Lamptey, impressive against his former side, kept darting past James and there were times when Chelsea did not seem to know how to handle Brighton’s right wing-back. Brighton, who matched Chelsea by using three at the back, were typically full of good intentions. Yves Bissouma was a driving presence in central midfield and Graham Potter’s side almost equalised in the 38th minute. Mendy was required to respond sharply when Adam Lallana lashed a fierce effort on target. Chelsea were increasingly edgy as half-time approached. Antonio Rüdiger, who always plays close to the edge, was fortunate not to be sent off for a wild challenge on Lamptey. Brighton had taken control and Chelsea, whose injury problems increased when Christensen had to be replaced by Trevoh Chalobah at half-time, spent much of the second half living on the edge. Heaven knows how Brighton contrived not to score before the dying stages. Jakub Moder sent a dainty flick inches over the bar and Bissouma saw a rising drive pushed over Mendy. At times it felt like Brighton were going through a shooting drill. Maupay zipped through before dragging an angled shot wide and the striker looked certain to equalise after fine play from Alexis Mac Allister left him with the goal at his mercy, only for Chalobah to make a vital block. Chelsea had grown ragged, their loss of composure underlined by Callum Hudson-Odoi botching a chance to release Mount. Down on the touchline, Tuchel was incandescent. Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic were being overrun in midfield and Chelsea only restored a semblance of order when N’Golo Kanté came on for Hudson-Odoi. Yet Brighton would not be denied. The game had just gone into stoppage time when Marc Cucurella crossed and Welbeck, rising between Chalobah and Rudiger, sent a brilliant header past Mendy.",Sport/Football,Welbeck’s late Brighton equaliser stuns Chelsea in fresh blow to title chances,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/29/chelsea-brighton-premier-league-match-report
