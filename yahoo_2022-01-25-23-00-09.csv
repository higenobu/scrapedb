1/25/2022,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — State Sen. Lauren Book often has told the story about how she was sexually abused by her nanny for six years when she was a child. She channeled the pain into a lifetime of helping other abuse survivors. Now after years of working hard to heal herself and restore her life — running a non-profit to help victims, getting married, having children and winning her Senate seat — Book has been victimized again, this time by someone trying to extort her by threatening to reveal nude photos that were stolen from her. What's worse: During the investigation, she learned that the images had been bought and traded online since 2000. “I hate that this happened to me,” Book told The Associated Press in an interview. “I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. But I’ll take it, because I know that I can do something about it.” Book is taking action as only a legislator can. While the pain came rushing back, so did her spirit to fight, and she's seeking a new law to try to prevent others from being victimized. The bill sponsored by Book, a Democrat, gets its first committee hearing Tuesday. It would strengthen Florida's revenge porn law by making it a felony to steal sexually explicit images from someone's phone or other digital devices. It would also make disseminating altered or created sexually explicit images, known as deepfakes, a felony. Book vented her anger in the phone interview with the AP Monday night as she described the international trade and sale of images stolen from people without their knowledge. She cursed loudly at times, and sometimes choked back tears. She called it a sick, perverted subculture that pays more for images of celebrities and elected officials, but which also victimizes women who aren't well known. “Truth be told, if it weren’t for my children, I would have ended my life,” she said. “It brought up all of the stuff. All of it that you think that you’ve gotten under your belt, that you’ve fixed it and you’ve changed it and then all of a sudden here it is in front of your face.” And the conversations people had on the website made the horror worse. “They were reading about who I was and talking about how I’m a survivor of rape, so let’s try to get some rape videos. Can we get some of her getting raped, killed, tortured? Can we make some of that? Can we find it? How can we get it?” Book said. Book still doesn’t know how the images were stolen. But she said investigators told her the images the teenager used to try to extort her were sent from virtual private networks in Sweden and Russia. As a 17-year-old daughter of an influential lobbyist, she found the courage while battling anorexia, sleepless nights and crying fits to go to Tallahassee and convince lawmakers and then-Gov. Jeb Bush to pass a law requiring HIV tests for rape suspects. Now she's a 37-year-old senator, and feels blessed to be in a position to fight back, with the resources to hire an attorney to have images removed from websites. Many others don't. Still, while her childhood abuse had a beginning and an end — her abuser was prosecuted and imprisoned — this case will go on forever. ""There are still things up there. Still. They’ll never be gone. People were buying it, people were trading it, and this is not unique. This is happening every single day, to women predominantly,” she said.",U.S./Associated Press,Florida senator fights back over nude images stolen from her,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-senator-fights-back-over-122006203.html

1/25/2022,"A New Jersey restaurant threatened to fire staff if they didn't get enough 5-star reviews on Google. The restaurant was hit by negative reviews after a Reddit post about the policy went viral. A director said it wasn't company policy and the employee who posted the sign has been fired. A restaurant in New Jersey threatened to fire front-of-house workers if they didn't get enough five-star reviews on Google. A director of the chain that owns the Tio Taco and Tequila Bar in New Jersey told the New York Post that it wasn't company policy, and that the employee who had posted the sign informing staff of the requirement has since been fired. A photo that went viral on Reddit posted Friday shows the sign at the Edison branch of the chain, saying that front-of-house staff had to get a minimum of five, five-star Google reviews each month. To count, the employees had to be personally named in the review. Staff had to meet the criteria ""to remain employed at the Edison location,"" the sign said. The sign also said that employees who got at least 15 Google reviews would be entered into monthly contests where they could win prizes including free food at the restaurant and a Starbucks gift card. Danielle Smith, a director at Tio, told the New York Post that it wasn't a company policy and that it hadn't been enforced. The employee who came up with the policy at the Edison restaurant had since been fired, she said. Thomas Bonfiglio, CEO of Tio's parent company Triple T Hospitality Group, told local news outlet NJ Advance Media Monday that the policy had been posted by an assistant manager without authorization from the company. ""It's not our policy,"" he said. The sign was taken down 15 minutes after being posted, Bonfiglio said. ""In the restaurant business we're not firing anyone, we're still trying to hire people,"" Bonfiglio said. ""So to think that we will fire people over this is a silly thing."" Tio did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment outside of normal working hours. NJ Advance Media reported that people had bombarded the 10 restaurants owned by Triple T Hospitality Group with negative reviews after the Reddit post went viral. Bonfiglio told NJ.com that he had hired a scrubbing company to remove the negative reviews. As of Tuesday morning, the most recent Google reviews for the Tio Edison restaurant were from five days prior – before the post got traction. ""It's not enough that we have a pandemic, it's not enough that we have a labor shortage, it is not enough that we have food inflation, it's not enough that people are insecure going in restaurants,"" Bonfiglio told NJ.com. ""It was scary to read ... You have 2,000 people saying‚ 'burn down and die, let's put them out of business.'"" On review site Yelp, the restaurant has around half a dozen one-star reviews, with captions referencing the five-star review policy. The Yelp page has a notice saying that it was being monitored by Yelp's Support team ""for content related to media reports,"" and that it had disabled new reviews for the restaurant ""as we work to investigate the content you see here reflects actual consumer experiences rather than the recent events."" The Tio Edison restaurant's Facebook page also has some negative reviews related to the Google Reviews policy, urging people to avoid dining there. Triple T Hospitality Group has three Tio restaurants, all in New Jersey, as well as six Tommy's Tavern and Tap restaurants in New Jersey, and one on Staten Island.
