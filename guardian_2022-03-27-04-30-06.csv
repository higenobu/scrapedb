3/27/2022,"The world must prepare for a “long fight ahead”, US president Joe Biden warned in a speech in Warsaw on Saturday that painted the war in Ukraine as part of a generation-spanning defence of universal democratic principles against a Russian order “governed by brute force”. “We emerged anew in the great battle for freedom,” the American leader said at his speech at the Polish presidential palace. “The battle between democracy and autocracy. Between liberty and repression. Between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.” “This battle will not be won in days or months,” he added. “We need to steel ourselves for a long fight ahead.” Just before Biden started his speech, Russian cruise missiles hit targets in the city of Lviv near Ukraine’s western border, about 400km (250 miles) from where the US president was speaking. Referencing Pope John Paul II’s “be not afraid” speech of 1979 at the beginning and end, Biden’s speech linked the war in Ukraine with historic moments of eastern European defiance against Soviet aggression. “The battle for democracy did not conclude with the fall of the Berlin Wall,” Biden said. “Today Russia has strangled democracy and sought to do so elsewhere, not just in its homeland.” He explicitly warned Russia of extending its war into Nato territory. “Don’t even think about moving one inch on to Nato territory,” Biden said. “The west is now more united than it has ever been.” Earlier in the day, Biden had emphasised the “sacred” tie of the Nato military alliance that binds several nations neighbouring Ukraine to the US. “We take article 5 as a sacred commitment,” the president told his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, in Warsaw on Saturday. “Not a throwaway. A sacred commitment that relates to every member of Nato.” “I’m confident that Vladimir Putin was counting on being able to divide NATO, to separate the eastern flank from the west, to separate nations based on past histories. But he hasn’t been able to do it. We’ve all stayed together. And it is so important that we keep in lockstep,” Biden said. Biden’s motorcade had arrived at the presidential palace in Warsaw at about 12:30am, after a short ride down a street lined with Polish and Ukrainian flags. Members of the Polish forces representing different branches of the military awaited the American leader in ceremonial uniforms. About an hour earlier Biden, his foreign secretary, Antony Blinken, and defence secretary Lloyd Austin had held a brief meeting with Ukrainian counterparts including foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and defence chief Oleksii Reznikov at the Marriott hotel in central Warsaw. At Stadion Narodowy, a football stadium converted into a refugee centre, Biden also met a number of people who have fled across the border into Poland to escape the bloodshed in Ukraine, as well as volunteers working to providing them with meals. Asked by reporters what seeing Ukrainian refugees at Stadion Narodowy made him think of as he deals with Vladimir Putin, Biden responded: “He’s a butcher.” 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled their country since the start of the war, of which an estimated 2.2 million have found shelter in Poland, whose conservative government’s welcoming stance has contrasted starkly to its reluctance to take in those fleeing the war in Syria six years ago. “We do not want to call them refugees,” said Polish president Duda, of the national-conservative Law and Justice party, on Saturday. “They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbours from Ukraine, who today are in a very difficult situation.” On Friday, Biden had flown into the Polish town of Rzeszów, about an hour’s drive from the Ukrainian border, where he got a first-hand look at international efforts to help more than 2 million Ukrainian refugees who have found temporary shelter in Poland from the war in their country, and met US troops bolstering Nato’s eastern flank. Over the past several months the US has bolstered European allies with the temporary deployment of thousands of additional troops to Poland, Germany and Romania. After some strains in its relationships with the US and the EU in recent years, Poland – which already hosted numerous US and Nato military bases and is a cornerstone of Nato’s eastern front – is enjoying a centre-stage position. The US and Poland have sometimes disagreed about the best way to support Ukraine. Earlier this month the US rejected a Polish proposal to send Soviet-era MiG fighter planes to Ukraine via US bases, which the White House viewed as too potentially escalatory. Similarly, when Jarosław Kaczyński – a Polish politician considered even more influential than President Duda – recently suggested that Nato deploy a peacekeeping force to Ukraine, Washington quickly and quietly swept the idea off the table.",News/World news,Biden tells west to prepare for ‘long fight ahead’ in Warsaw speech,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/biden-tells-west-to-prepare-for-long-fight-ahead-in-warsaw-speech
3/27/2022,"One of Queensland’s leading infectious diseases experts has called on the state government to rethink winding down Covid testing services given the current wave of infections. On Saturday, Queensland recorded 9,404 new Covid cases, with eight deaths, and 295 patients in hospital, including 19 in ICU. Covid infections had increased by more than 50% in the past two weeks, and the state’s chief health officer, John Gerrard, said on Friday that about one in 50 school-aged children had tested positive in the past week alone. From 7 March, the state government tightened eligibility so that pathology labs could only conduct free, Medicare-funded Covid tests for patients who present with a doctor’s referral. For a free PCR test without a referral, patients must present at one of the state’s testing and fever clinics. However, the state was closing many of its testing and fever clinics. Of Brisbane’s four metro south community screening clinics, two closed on Friday: the Logan West Community Centre and Nathan RAT drive-through distribution centre. In Cairns, the Showground Testing and Fever Clinic would close on Sunday. The state’s online clinic finder also included several that were no longer open, leading to frustration and confusion among patients trying to do the right thing. Dr Paul Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Queensland, said closing testing and fever clinics as cases grow was “a terrible plan”. “Winding those things back right now is not the right time,” he said. “There’s this perception that we’ve won, we’ve moved past Covid and it’s clearly not the case.” Debra Venables, from Woolloongabba, was isolating with her second dose of Covid in a month. When she called the Queensland Health Covid hotline to describe her symptoms, she was told she couldn’t have Covid twice in four weeks and shouldn’t get tested. “As a scientist, that didn’t make sense. I had the same symptoms as people in my family who had tested positive, I had different symptoms to last time, and I’d tested negative on a PCR in between infections,” Venables said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said she was frustrated by having to pay for a telehealth appointment with her GP to check the official advice. “I didn’t want to be in my house longer than I needed to be, but at the same time I didn’t want to be in the street spreading Covid,” she said. Her GP told her to get a PCR test, which later returned a positive result. However, Venables said even finding an adult clinic to conduct the test was fraught. She eventually managed to get tested at the Queensland Children’s hospital clinic in south Brisbane, although the Queensland Health website said the testing facility was only for “children up to 16 years” and accompanying adults. Staff at the clinic confirmed they were testing anyone who turned up. Griffin said the state needed to be making it easier, not harder, for parents to find out if their children had Covid. “We haven’t eradicated this virus, and as we relax other restrictions such as mask-wearing we need to rely more on the basics, which is vaccination and testing,” he said.

That would have been three times $80,” Fung said. She said her family went home and isolated instead, relying on results from rapid antigen tests (RATs). But with the sensitivity of RATs inferior to PCRs, Griffin said it needed to be easy to get the latter when required. “If people have symptoms and they’ve still tested negative on a RAT they need a PCR,” he said. “We’re also seeing testing times blow out and I would have thought by this time in the pandemic we should have been getting these things right.” Australian Associated Press contributed to this report.",News/Australia news,‘Terrible plan’: call for Queensland to stop closing Covid testing clinics as case numbers escalate,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/terrible-plan-call-for-queensland-to-stop-closing-covid-testing-clinics-as-case-numbers-escalate
3/27/2022,"Andrew Forrest says he isn’t after power. He didn’t aim to become wealthy. The 27.2 billion dollar man just “wants to leave the world a better place”. The American novelist John Barth wrote that “everyone is necessarily the hero of his own life story”. Forrest is certainly that. But his story – including, but not limited to, the staggering success of his iron ore business and the even more staggering ambition of his clean energy plans – is writ large enough for others to read. And they don’t all see him as a white knight. Forrest is a very busy and very complicated man. People describe him as paradoxical but passionate, driven and difficult, ambitious and controlling. Those who have met him talk about his unswerving confidence, his charm. Some mention his generosity, such as the Giving Pledge he signed with his wife, Nicola. One person close to him says he’s emulating thefounder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, with the scale of his philanthropy. The most critical decline to speak publicly. Forrest is the founder and now non-executive chair of Fortescue Metals Group, the WA mining ore business that made a profit of almost $14bn last financial year; the founder and chair of its subsidiary Fortescue Future Industries, which plans to deliver 15m tonnes of green hydrogen to the world by 2030; and chair of the Minderoo Foundation, his charitable arm. The fourth pillar of his business world is the family holding company, Tattarang, a private investment group with a multibillion-dollar portfolio of assets earning money for Minderoo. He’s one of Australia’s richest men and, especially during the pandemic, one of the busiest people on the planet. He was buying Covid tests and PPE, dodging deadly terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, making deals in PNG. His presence loomed large at Cop26. He scooted around in his private plane, invested in medicinal cannabis and snapped up Lizard Island for $42m. He’s developing electric trains and green ammonia-powered ships (it’s impossible to keep up with all the environmental projects he’s involved in). He has invested in aquaculture and cheese. And he has continued to tackle Facebook for for its alleged failure to stop cryptocurrency-related scam ads featuring his image. Asked if he has ever felt that he has bitten off more than he can chew, he tells Guardian Australia what he used to tell his staff at Anaconda Nickel, his first big venture: “You bite off more than you can chew, then you chew like buggery.” While Australia faced rolling Covid lockdowns and border closures, Forrest and his team took a private jet to visit more than 40 countries on a mission to convince the world of the need for green hydrogen. His plan so far has elicited both hope and scepticism. It may seem “ironic”, he says, that he’s on this clean, green mission, when FMG is “a huge player in carbon pollution”. In an ad for FFI, Forrest thanks the fossil fuel industry for its “great service”. Flanked by a vaguely Downton Abbey-style breakfast spread that features a toast rack, a teapot and bowls of berries, he holds a fake newspaper with the headline: “Fossil fuel industry in terminal decline”. “Climate chaos” will render humanity extinct if the use of fossil fuels continues unchecked, he warns. “[The] party’s over,” he says, as ominous music plays. “I know it, you know it.” Forrest has pushed the federal government to adopt a net zero emissions target by 2050, even as he continues to mine iron ore, which he said recently had “a fabulous future”. In a more nuanced take at his National Press Club speech last year, he said: “So, let’s keep fossil fuel going but only as long as we need to, and let’s do everything we need to switch to a green future.” The party may be over, it seems, but Forrest has not yet grabbed his coat. Asked if FFI will morally offset what FMG has done, he says the question is “moronic”. “If you take a second in time only,” he says, “then nothing excuses anyone for doing anything wrong. “The world is never going to turn its back on steel … so the only solution is to turn the making of steel green,” Forrest says. “[Polluting businesses] must go green. If they don’t go green … you and I cook the world. Either directly or indirectly because we’re consumers.” It’s a hugely ambitious plan, but Forrest points to FMG’s success saying people doubted it would ever mine 40m tonnes of iron ore. “We’re clicking a little under 200m tonnes,” he says, “and the iron ore price is strong. “If I said something which I’m going to put my heart and soul to – judge me on my actions, judge me on whether I die trying, but don’t say ‘he makes grandiose statements’ because you’ve got to judge people on what they do, not on what other people say or what they say.” Considering his enormous power, influence, wealth and promises, it’s worth taking a look at what he has done, and said. Forrest grew up at Minderoo station running cattle in the Pilbara, out in Western Australia. His great-grandfather David Forrest founded the station with his brothers, including John, who would go on to become WA’s first premier. His father was forced to sell the property, but he bought it back for a reported $12m in 2009. Forrest went to high school and then university in Perth, before beginning Anaconda Nickel in the early 1990s. In 2001 investors tried to oust him as chief executive after the share price dipped. Forrest agreed to step down, calling it “a nasty precedent in Australia’s corporate history”. In 2002 the ABC’s Four Corners detailed the messy break-up, saying Forrest “mixed business with philanthropy”, donating shares from Anaconda to one of his charities, Leaping Joey. That led to accusations he was minimising his income tax – an accusation he described as “really, really hurtful”. Forrest’s former partner, mining analyst Warwick Grigor, said the donation was “how he’d like to be seen as a philanthropist doing good for kids … but the fact that it bought shares off him is just more evidence that Andrew’s always got a hidden agenda and he doesn’t do anything totally for – out of the goodness of his heart,” he told the ABC. Forrest says those comments were “a long time ago”. “I’m doing everything in my power to leave this world a better place if I possibly can,” he says. “Yet the Guardian does tend to draw out every possible negative story they can find, even going back to my old friend Warwick. “Sometimes people are really pissed off with you,” he says, although the pair have now reconciled. Grigor agrees. “Time cures everything,” he says. “We had our disagreements. He’s gone on and done wonderful things, and things that I don’t know any other Australian is capable of doing. His life is very different to mine and I’m grateful for that. I don’t bear him any animosity.” Forrest’s next major move was establishing FMG, now one of the world’s largest iron ore companies – he stepped down as chief operating officer and became its chair in 2011. It has been lauded for awarding more than $3bn in contracts to Aboriginal companies, but also condemned for allegedly breaching heritage protection laws at a sacred site in the Pilbara in February 2021. In that case FMG’s chief executive, Elizabeth Gaines, expressed regret and issued “a sincere apology on behalf of Fortescue” for what it called an administrative error. In 2020, the high court dismissed an appeal by FMG against a decision to give the Yindjibarndi people native title over land in the Pilbara after a long battle over access and royalties. Then came the battle against the mining tax, which Forrest and FMG took all the way to the high court. The court ultimately rejected the move to overturn the Minerals Resource Rent Tax, which forced coal and iron ore companies to pay 22.5% on profits above $75m. It wasn’t the last time Forrest would be attacked for trying to influence government policy. As prime minister, Tony Abbott commissioned Forrest to write a report on employment and training. The report Forrest produced in 2014, Creating Parity, ventured much further afield by introducing the idea of a “healthy welfare card” – a precursor to the cashless debit card. This card, Forrest said, would assist people to make “proper decisions” by stopping them using welfare to buy alcohol or cigarettes. The card has drawn fierce criticism from Indigenous organisations and their supporters. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, the peak body, has been a consistent critic. In a submission to a Senate inquiry it said when the card was compulsory it was a “violation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s right to self-determination” and had “adverse effects on the social and emotional wellbeing and general health of participants”. There had been inadequate consultation, Naccho said, and inadequate evidence that the card worked to prevent gambling and drinking. The WA Labor senator Sue Lines called the card “racist” in parliament. “It takes away people’s basic human rights,” she said. Lines questioned why Forrest was asked to do the work in the first place. “Was it a well-researched idea backed up with academic evidence? No. It came from a billionaire based in WA. It was an idea of Twiggy Forrest’s,” she said. “Because he has money, power and privilege he was able to just walk in … and put this idea on the table.” The Ngaat­yan­jarra shire president, Damian McLean, says Forrest is “a guy with prodigious financial interests who should have been excluded from everything to do with Indigenous affairs”. Forrest calls accusations of racism “bullshit”. He says he was raised by Indigenous people. “[I was a person] taught corroboree by Indigenous people, taught to hunt and track, to sing and dance by Aboriginal people, who loves Aboriginal people and every day of my life I’ve fought for the interests of Aboriginal people.” He doesn’t resile at all from the card, and denies it unfairly targeted Indigenous people. “I didn’t come up with a set of recommendations just for Indigenous people … I said to Tony Abbott at the time, ‘I cannot do that. I [can] come up with a suite of recommendations which you can apply to all vulnerable Australians’,” he says. But alcohol and drugs are the “root cause” of not being able to get Aboriginal people into work, he says. “It brings out the very worst in people … it’s obvious.” But he does say he would have done some things differently. “I do have a regret,” he says. “I should have recommended that anyone who voluntarily took up the cashless debit … I would have recommended a 10% increase in welfare,” he says. Giving an overall increase like that would save the government money by stopping violence, keeping people out of jail, and getting people into work, he says. People would be changing their lives for the better, so they’d have more money to spend “on the right things”. Forrest also points to the other 26 recommendations in the report, which were meant to be implemented as a package. Forrest prides himself on his work with Aboriginal people, and one of his Minderoo Foundation programs – Generation One – aims to create parity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. It’s an “audacious, challenging, and at times overwhelming goal”, according to its website, “but we strive for it because allowing this disparity to continue is not an option”. At the heart of Generation One is helping Aboriginal people get jobs. A previous Forrest endeavour, the Australian Employment Covenant, had the same aim. It was an agreement between the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd and Forrest as part of the Closing the Gap project, and launched in 2008. The government paid the Covenant $20.9m to achieve the target of creating 50,000 sustainable jobs for Aboriginal people. Forrest says he employed “one and then two and then three, and then hundreds, and over time thousands”. “I’m pretty sure that’s why I got asked [to write Creating Parity], because I’ve got real skin in the game,” he says. A government audit report in 2013 found that while the program achieved some of its aims, the government “did not facilitate the expected level of ongoing collaboration”, and that there was not enough information available to properly measure the outcomes. Last year, a Deloitte report found that in a range of employment partnerships between Fortescue and the government “there is limited evidence of Indigenous perspectives influencing the design of these programs, and no clear nor complete documentation of what success looks like nor how this was to be achieved”. Fast forward to the Covid pandemic, and there are more ambitious projects that don’t have happy, uncomplicated endings. In 2020, the federal government turned to Forrest for help in finding testing kits. At a strange press conference with the health minister, Greg Hunt, Forrest announced he had used his Chinese connections to secure 10m Covid tests at a cost of about $189m, at the urging of Hunt. Forrest brought along the Chinese consul Long Zhou, who Hunt initially thought was one of Forrest’s employees, according to media reports. But the tests were a new kind of technology, and the uptake was patchy. Public health units in most states found no use for them, although some were later deployed by private pathology providers in Victoria. The author Nichola Garvey spent 10 years getting to know Forrest, trying to write an authorised biography that ultimately never emerged. Garvey recently wrote a fascinating essay on the process, and the reasons she believes the book was never published – essentially because Forrest would not relinquish control of the narrative. Garvey gives full credit to Forrest for his many achievements, but says the traits of control and domination that drove his business success, when translated to the social sphere, “risk becoming intensely unappealing, and perhaps help explain Forrest’s contested reputation”. She paints him as a complicated mix of parsimony and generosity, a huge contributor to charity, but “almost hypervigilant about the most minor donations” and prone to leaving restaurant bills for others to pay. Forrest says Garvey went through an “angry stage” with him, but that they had since worked out their differences. The scope of Minderoo Foundation is mindboggling. It includes Walk Free (a human rights group focused on anti-slavery); Thrive by Five (advocating early childhood education for every Australian); and Generation One (First Nation people’s rights and interests). The No Plastic Waste initiative envisions a world without plastic pollution; Frontier Technology is working “to address the widespread violation of human rights associated with the unfettered use and abuse of personal information in the tech ecosystem”; Flourishing Oceans plans to restore ocean health; Fire & Flood Resilience seeks to be an “enabler”, helping communities bounce back. There are other programs to fight cancer, build communities, boost arts and culture. Forrest and his wife, Nicola, have given $2bn to these causes. Some, though, have ethical and philosophical questions about philanthropy – questions that similarly revolve around control. “You won’t find philanthropists funding projects which don’t have happy endings,” says Ian Macauley of the Centre for Policy Development, who worries that philanthropic spending can displace government funding. “It can convey the impression that if the philanthropists are doing it, the government doesn’t have to,” he says. That’s a concern that has also been voiced, quietly, by charities. Carl Rhodes is a professor of organisation studies at the University of Technology Sydney, and the author of Woke Capitalism: How Corporate Morality is Sabotaging Democracy. “Big corporations are increasingly encroaching on the traditional role of government, through philanthropy or other actions,” he says. “Why should they get to make these decisions, and what happens when they get involved? “It’s not that they do anything bad,” he says. “It’s just that we have a system where power is shifting from the public sphere and into the private sphere, so power is increasingly in the hands of private interests. “Who’s deciding what the public good is?” But Forrest says Walk Free, for example, has forced governments to face the fact that slavery exists and put pressure on them to end it. “It’s saying: ‘Here’s the scale of your problem. Support companies, support non-government organisations that are trying to end it for you’,” he says. “Frankly, until we came along, governments said: ‘We don’t have any [problems]’.” Now Forrest has embarked on what may be the most ambitious plan of all – converting the world to green hydrogen. FFI describes itself as “a global green energy and product company committed to producing zero-emission green hydrogen from 100% renewable sources”. “Our vision is to make renewable green hydrogen the most globally traded seaborne energy commodity in the world.” The Australian has reported FFI deals struck in Croatia, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and elsewhere in Africa. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, says there is a lot of hype when it comes to hydrogen’s possibilities. But there’s hope too. He says the fossil fuel industry is using hydrogen as a “facelift”, which gives it a social licence to keep producing fossil fuels. And he’s sceptical about what sort of hydrogen will end up dominating – there’s a “rainbow”, he says. “Green hydrogen has zero emissions, so you use renewables to power an electrolyser to turn water into hydrogen. It’s super clean and green,” Merzian says. Forrest is promising all-green hydrogen, but Merzian says the technological transition will not be easy. “But what Twiggy has done … is fast-tracked the debate,” he says. “It’s helped. What you have is a massive mining baron who’s benefited from the status quo actually positioning himself and making a clear pivot into an industry that is aligned with a decarbonised future. “It’s not all good … but the overall objective, the big picture, the commitment is good.” John Mathews, professor emeritus at Macquarie University’s business school, has said that Australia’s hydrogen industry could be worth $26bn by 2050, and says the revolution is possible if green hydrogen is manufactured at scale. Forrest’s claims there will be no bigger industry than green hydrogen and ammonia “may sound outlandish”, Mathews has written, but “history suggests they’re possible”. Forrest’s latest chapter – saving the world from the climate crisis – could truly cast him as a hero. It’s not only an immensely ambitious role, but one with measurable outcomes. As he insists, history will judge him not by what he says, but by what he does.",News/Australia news,"‘Judge me on my actions’: can Andrew Forrest become Australia’s clean, green hero?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/judge-me-on-my-actions-can-andrew-forrest-become-australias-clean-green-hero
3/27/2022,"Drought, fires and, more recently, floods: these are the things wool producers fear. But that’s just “living on the land”, according to New South Wales merino producer Anthea Sutherland. What she and husband John were not prepared for was the sudden drop in demand for their farm’s wool when the pandemic prompted people to swap suits for tracksuits while working from home. The market tumbled: a kilogram of fine merino wool dropped from about $20 to $8, at its lowest. While prices have rebounded – although not to pre-pandemic levels – the Sutherlands and the wider industry are seeking to diversify the uses for wool to ensure the longevity of the commodity and their way of life. “We have to look at promoting our product, our fibre,” Sutherland says, speaking to the Guardian from Pooginook, her merino stud near Jerilderie in the state’s Riverina region. “People aren’t dressing up and wearing suits as much as what they used to. “We have to let people know that properties of wool are so good at keeping you cool and keeping you warm and you can use wool for activewear.” Athletic brands like Byron’s Nagnata and Melbourne-based MAAP are part of the solution Sutherland envisages - spinning yarn into functional sport and ‘commuter-wear’ for the next generation. Wool Australia chief executive, John Roberts, describes it as one of his focuses for the year ahead. “We call it ‘commuter wear’ or ‘transit wear’ - it’s a big growth area. People can get to work in those more active ways, but still have the odour management qualities and moisture management qualities that wool provides,” he says. “They can turn up to work and look good and feel good and be comfortable.” A recent report by KPMG demographer, Terry Rawnsley found use of public transport had dropped during the pandemic, while walking and cycling jumped. Rawnsley predicts some of those patterns will stick, in cities like Sydney and Melbourne where long lockdowns and gradual reopening gave workers long enough to set new habits. “The number of people in active travel has ticked up above where it was pre-coronavirus,” he says. “Some of the people who would have formerly caught public transport, with concerns about cleanliness, health and being crowded together, have switched to active transport,” he says. “Behaviours, once they become set, are hard to break.” But capitalising on the potential growth market isn’t easy – as Nagnata co-founder and designer Laura May Gibbs learned. It’s taken her years to develop her woollen athletic wear and she’s still refining it, working with producers in China to create technical knits suiting vigorous exercise. Quality control is crucial, according to Craig Smith, Campaign for Wool New Zealand board member and general manager of woollen activewear company Devold. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In many ways New Zealand has already forged the path for Australian producers, pioneering merino activewear over the past decade with brands including Icebreaker and SmartWool. Smith says there are lessons Australia can learn from its neighbour. “Everyone wants to jump on the bandwagon a wee bit with outdoor activewear, but some of our consumers, especially younger ones, have very little knowledge about wool so we have one chance to get the right impression,” he says. “If you’re going to get into this market, make sure that you’re putting the best ingredients you can in, otherwise we’re going to lose that market share against our synthetic friends. That’s our competition, not other merino products.” Sutherland hopes the product’s biodegradable properties also get eco-conscious youngsters on board, although the green credentials of wool aren’t guaranteed and largely depend on how it’s produced, which varies. There’s also an ongoing conversation around the mulesing of sheep to produce ultra-fine merino. But the industry’s biggest challenge may be getting people to see wool as a hot weather option. “I wear mine sometimes and not wash them for two or three weeks, wearing them multiple times a week just walking,” Northern Rivers-based Gibbs says. “It has been an education process for sure but once people put them on.. well, it really is like a second skin feeling and they become addicted. They can’t go back to lycra.” Dennis Voznesenski, a Rabobank agricultural analyst says the lockdown-induced drop hit the Australian wool export market hard, but activewear has been bucking the overall apparel trend – with recent Trademap data showing US sporting apparel containing wool was 21% above 2019 levels. Voznesenski predicts fine wool prices will continue to bounce around the $14.50kg mark for the coming year – remaining about 10% under the five-year average. Sutherland’s hoping a new generation of sustainability-minded consumers can get on board, giving producers another growing chunk of the fashion market. “The older generation, my generation, know about the qualities of wool but it’s the younger generation that we actually have to show the quality - and that’s where using wool with all the lifestyle, sport and activewear [comes in],” she says. “It’s about convincing the rest of the world that that’s what our product can do.”",News/Australia news,Can woolgrowers ride an activewear boom out of the industry’s pandemic bust?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/can-woolgrowers-ride-an-activewear-boom-out-of-the-industrys-pandemic-bust
3/27/2022,"Researchers have pinpointed exactly how and when echidnas likely arrived in Australia as part of a fossil analysis shedding new light on the origins of egg-laying mammals. The platypus and four species of echidna are the only remaining living monotremes – mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. New analysis of every monotreme fossil discovered to date has recast the earliest history of the animals. The research, published in the journal Alcheringa, was led by the Australian Museum’s chief scientist, Prof Kristofer Helgen, and honorary associate, Prof Tim Flannery. Mysteriously, their analysis found the oldest echidna in the Australian fossil record dated back just 2m years, relatively recent in the species evolutionary history. “It’s tens of millions of years since echidnas and platypuses have shared a common ancestor,” Helgen said. The study’s authors believe that echidnas may have migrated to Australia from the Bird’s Head Peninsula on the island of New Guinea at the beginning of the last ice age, about 2.6m years ago. “That [region] is a good candidate because there are several species of echidnas there today,” Helgen said. All four living echidna species can be found in New Guinea, while only the short-beaked echidna is present in Australia. Periodically through history, New Guinea has been physically connected to the Australian continent. “Ten thousand years ago, you could walk between the two,” Helgen said. “It almost certainly had to be some kind of Lost Ark of New Guinea island that was harbouring echidnas … because they’re invisible through a pretty good Australian fossil record [for millions of years], for a group of animals that fossilised pretty well.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The researchers have also classified the earliest monotreme, a tiny insect-eating creature that lived an estimated 126m years ago, in its own mammalian family. The animal, Teinolophos trusleri, weighed an estimated 40g and lived at a time when southeastern Australia lay close to the south pole, as part of the supercontinent Gondwana. Helgen said Teinolophos trusleri likely possessed an “unusual sixth sense that monotremes use” – a large set of nerves in their faces that are capable of detecting electric fields, which help find prey. “We think that in a place where there would have been polar night for a lot of the year … this might have been the right condition for that kind of monotreme hallmark to evolve.” “Even though it was so long ago … [Teinolophos] was already on the track to evolving the characteristic bill that later we see in platypuses and echidnas,” he added. Fossils of the monotreme were first found at Flat Rocks in eastern Victoria. The distinct categorisation as a new taxonomic family provides “a really good indication that this was a completely different way of being a mammal”, Helgen said. “The dogs are a family, the cats are a family.” Examining the fossil record, the researchers found that monotremes subsequently diversified in Australia, with some evolving body masses between 4 and 8kg. “These are some of the largest mammals that existed anywhere on the planet during the age of dinosaurs,” Helgen said. The team also named a new genus, Murrayglossus, for the largest egg-laying mammal that ever lived: a giant extinct echidna from Western Australia. “We think they probably reached something like 30kg in size,” Helgen said. In comparison, short-beaked echidnas averaged 3.5kg, while New Guinea’s long-beaked echidnas averaged 7 to 8kg, he said. “We think that this has adaptations that show it was probably the best of the echidnas … at climbing,” Helgen said, adding: “Modern echidnas are actually really good climbers – they can climb up trees and fences.” The comprehensive fossil analysis, he said, gave the team an opportunity to “tell this single sweeping story of how monotremes came to be.”",News/Science,Australian scientists solve mystery of moment monotremes migrated ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/27/australian-scientists-solve-mystery-of-moment-monotremes-migrated
3/27/2022,"Wergaia and Wamba Wamba elder Eleanor Bourke is conscious of how closely First Nations communities around Australia are watching Victoria’s truth-telling commission She’s even been warned: “Don’t muck it up.” As chair of the Yoorrook Justice Commission, Prof Bourke is leading Australia’s first formal truth-telling inquiry for past and ongoing systemic injustices experienced by First Nations people. “Treaty is on the agenda in other places – and they are watching us, our brothers and sisters elsewhere,” she says while launching the inquiry in Melbourne on Thursday. As Victoria begins the Indigenous-led process of documenting the ongoing effects of colonisation on Aboriginal people, there are hopes its work could propel the momentum building in other states and territories for truth-telling processes and treaties. Yoorrook has a mandate to investigate and document past and present injustices against the state’s First Nations people, including by the state and non-government bodies. While it is independent from the state’s First Peoples’ Assembly – the body elected by the state’s Indigenous people to help develop a treaty – the commission will help inform the agreement’s framework. Co-chair of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria Aunty Geraldine Atkinson says Yoorrook is central to the negotiation of the state’s treaty. “We can’t have a treaty without the truth being told ,” she tells Guardian Australia. “We want a commission to make recommendations to ensure we get a good outcome for the Aboriginal community. It’s about looking for justice for the Stolen Generation and all those people who were misplaced, for the genocide that was committed.” The commission’s commencement comes after decades of calls – most notably in the 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart – for Australia to commit to a formal truth-telling process. The Victorian inquiry – equipped with the power of a royal commission – is modelled on South Africa’s post-apartheid hearings. Similar processes have been held in New Zealand and Canada. But while those inquiries were nationwide, Yoorrook will be limited to investigating the injustices experienced by Victoria’s First Nations community. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sue-Anne Hunter, deputy chair of the commission, believes a state-by state approach is best practice for truth-telling because each jurisdiction was “colonised differently”. “We’re all different peoples. We have different cultural practices,” she tells Guardian Australia. Hunter says some of the inquiry’s hearings “on country” would take place near the New South Wales-Victorian border. “If that’s where the truth takes us of what’s happened to our people, that’s where we’ll go,” she says. But Hunter believes truth-telling hearings in other jurisdictions could inform a nationwide treaty. In other parts of Australia, momentum is building in this space. South Australia’s newly elected Labor government has committed to a separate voice, treaty and truth process, after former premier Steven Marshall paused the state’s treaty negotiations in 2018. Queensland and the Northern Territory are in the early stages of a path towards a treaty. In Victoria, opposition leader Matthew Guy has previously argued a national treaty was a better approach. Bourke claims the commonwealth has been non-responsive on treaty and truth, given their response to the Uluru statement – the culmination of the voices of 250 First Nation elected delegates. The Morrison government rejected the key call to enshrine an Indigenous voice to parliament and its plans to legislate a “Voice to Government” is yet to eventuate. “They’re still talking about how to hear the Aboriginal voice. Now that’s almost archaic in the context of Victoria talking about a treaty,” Bourke says. The Uluru manifesto calls for a constitutional recognition via a First Nations voice to the Australian parliament. It also calls for the creation of a Makarrata Commission to oversee the process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations people and truth-telling about Indigenous history. Federal Labor has vowed to enact the Uluru statement in its entirety if elected. But, for now, Victoria is the only jurisdiction that is currently moving on both the treaty and truth components of the Uluru statement. For Bourke, it’s unsurprising that Victoria is going it alone on a truth-telling and treaty process, given the state’s history of land justice over the past thirty years. She points to numerous successful Native Title determinations in the early 2000s and the 2010 Victorian Traditional Owner Settlement Act. That legal framework formally recognises traditional owners, outside the federal government’s native title scheme. “All of those things made our people believe it was possible to do more ,” she says. “Victoria was very ready [for truth-telling’]. I think in many ways, given what has happened, the early part of this century.” The commission will aim to document Indigenous stories from 1788 to present day in a culturally appropriate way, in an attempt to improve reconciliation, educate Victorians and the wider public about the state’s history and shape Aboriginal affairs in the state’s curriculum. It will make recommendations for redress and reform to the state government and First Peoples’ Assembly for injustices, from the time of colonisation through the stolen generations up to the present day, detailing the treatment of Indigenous Australians. Bourke hails this week’s launch a “momentous” occasion for Australia, Victoria and all First Nations people. But senior counsel-assisting the commission Tony McAvoy acknowledges the bureaucratic challenges the inquiry would likely face. He points to languishing recommendations from previous inquiries, such as the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. “Whilst we might have many expressions of political will, of good conscience, the difficulty largely lies in the bureaucracy and the bureaucracy in this state as in other states and territories in this country, is colonial,” he says. “It’s not designed for First Nations people. So our job is a difficult one. We don’t underestimate the difficulty of the task, but that’s what we intend to do.”",News/Australia news,‘Don’t muck it up’: First Nations communities are closely watching Victoria’s truth-telling commission,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/dont-muck-it-up-first-nations-communities-are-closely-watching-victorias-truth-telling-commission
3/27/2022,"Every spring, longtime beekeeper Tony Wilsmore will start getting phone calls. Usually people see his phone number on the side of the cargo bike that he rides around the Melbourne suburb of Moonee Ponds, tending to various backyard hives in the inner north as part of his business Suburban Bees. As their garden starts blooming and thoughts turn to outside, people want to register their interest in keeping hives. “The first thing I do,” says Wilsmore, “is try to convince them that they should not keep bees.” Having grown up on farms and keeping bees as a kid, Wilsmore retired from a career in health and community services five years ago to start beekeeping full-time. He currently keeps around 22 of his own hives and tends to other hives around the inner north. Since he returned to maintaining hives, interest in backyard beekeeping has surged, with official numbers of recreational beekeepers in Australia climbing to over 28,000 nationally, up from 23,000 within five years. This global phenomenon has been fuelled by a combination of factors, including an increased awareness of the dwindling numbers of honeybee colonies, a need to connect to nature inspired by Covid lockdowns, and the appeal of honey on demand via a hobby that may seem more accessible with the advent of YouTube instructional videos. As a result, suburban bee novices have set hives on roofs, balconies and backyards in cities around the world. But this explosion of well-meaning amateur beekeepers has some experts concerned. A core part of Wilsmore’s business is to promote the environmental importance of bees and increase the number of people keeping bees, and yet when the initial phone call comes through, he says: “Look, I’m going to try and convince you not to have these. “After I’ve done my best and you still want to keep these livestock – because that’s what they are – I’m happy to come around and work with you to assess where you live, who you have in your household, the opportunities that you’ve got to keep bees and what the upsides and downsides are.” Wilsmore is encouraged by what drives people’s desire to start beekeeping, but he’s adamant those good intentions have to be matched by an awareness of the responsibilities of keeping livestock, and the wider context that their new hives operate within. Wilsmore is often the guy councils call to tend to local swarms, a phenomenon that’s increased over the years alongside the rise of backyard beekeeping and is mostly left to local councils to deal with. The risks around potential disease in hives that aren’t properly monitored has also increased. But the biggest risk for the bees themselves comes down to insufficient habitat. A combination of the destruction of habitat in both urban and regional areas, a trend towards smaller backyards, and an increase in honeybee hives in urban areas creates more competition for rural resources for both honeybees and native bees. “I think people are compelled to keep a beehive because they fundamentally want to help the bees. And my message is usually the first step to helping bees is to plant flowers,” says Fiona Chambers, CEO of the Wheen Bee Foundation, a not-for-profit charity for bees. “Before people get a hive of bees, they need to think very seriously: [are there] enough flowers, and not just in spring, but are there enough flowers across the calendar year to support the bees?” The foundation, which was started by Gretchen Wheen, one of Australia’s best-known beekeepers, supports research and education initiatives that address the national and global threats to bees, strengthen honey and native bees, improve pollination efficiency and increase food security. Those issues inevitably lead the foundation to recognise the role of all the other pollinators in our ecosystem, not least native bees (of which Australia has over 2,000 species) but also including beetles, wasps and moths. “It’s not just about bees. The big issue facing both honeybees and native bees, and other insects, is lack of floral resources,” says Chambers. A report by researchers at Curtin University, released last year, found that introduced honeybees were more effective and voracious in gathering food than their native counterparts. The two-year study of bee populations in Perth found that in residential areas, competition between honeybees and natives was especially fierce and that competition – in addition to habitat loss – risked putting some native bee species under threat of becoming endangered or extinct. Just as introduced honeybees play a crucial role in pollinating our food crops, native bees are essential when it comes to supporting native habitat, and some argue are an untapped resource for supporting Australian agriculture. Pollination is an issue much bigger than honey, and more valuable. “The total value of honey product in Australia is about $120m a year,” says Chambers. “If you look at the estimated economic value of the pollination services provided by those honeybees [managed and wild honeybee pollinators], it’s $14.2bn per year.” Cedar Anderson, the co-founder and inventor of the wildly popular Flow Hive, agrees. In one of the promotional videos for his product, he says: “Honey is almost the bonus.” “We have developed food systems that rely on the honeybee. Humans have dragged them around the world, wherever they go. And we know very well now that without them we’re in trouble,” says Anderson. “But the other part of that story is that there’s all sorts of other pollinators as well, [and] if you can’t keep honeybees alive, then it’s likely the environment, all of the other insects, are suffering as well.” In almost every recent news report on the backyard beekeeping phenomenon you’ll find a mention of Flow Hive and their contribution to the boom in popularity. It has been seven years since Anderson and his father Stuart, who together invented Flow Hive, watched as their crowdfunding campaign blew up to become the most successful crowdfunding campaign ever outside the US. Within 15 minutes of going live, the campaign had attracted US$250,000 in preorders. The duo’s hive reimagines the way honey is extracted (it comes out of a tap) after Anderson, a beekeeper since the age of six, was inspired to create a system that didn’t crush bees in the extraction process, and was more time efficient and less messy. Anderson and his dad quickly realised their product’s appeal was far wider than they imagined. “It became very clear very quickly that it was inspiring a whole new crowd of beekeepers in the world.” Some beekeepers have been critical of Flow Hive for attracting novice beekeepers with what they argue is the suggestion that backyard honey is as easy as turning on a tap. But others argue the company has generated a renewed interest in beekeeping, and that presents an opportunity to harness the enthusiasm of a captive audience. Anderson says he and his father decided they wanted to help inform their instant customer base. “We really got quite quickly into making content around how to keep these bees,” he says. “It just became clear that education was the key.” This was motivated by a sense of responsibility towards the bees, “but also a responsibility for the customers that they’re successful in their new pursuit”. Flow have since invested in a series of education and regeneration programs, including an online beekeeping course and the Billions of Blossoms project launched earlier this year with the goal of creating billions of new flowers for pollinators through a mix of reforestation and habitat protection and funded in part by their beekeeping course. Anderson says about half of their customers are new to beekeeping and are attracted to Flow for the appeal of the honey delivery system, but also because they’re interested in contributing to pollination efforts. “The honeybees are a gateway insect into viewing the world in a more interconnected way where not only honeybees, but humans, have a place in the natural systems,” explains Anderson. “The feedback we get from people that are new to beekeeping is that they tend to suddenly realise the interconnectedness of what’s going on in their local surrounds because their hives are bringing in nectar from a 10km radius. And all of a sudden they’re like, well, hang on a second. I need to put away the insecticide, get out the habitat.” Wilsmore agrees. Apart from urging novice beekeepers to go join a club, “go and play with some bees”, and get a feel for them before they don the suit in their own backyard, he says the best thing “bee people” can do is plant plants. “If you’re lucky, you’ll be attracting some native bees as well. Yes. And that’s even better.”",News/Environment,Honey trap: is there a downside to the boom in beekeeping? ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/27/honey-trap-is-there-a-downside-to-the-boom-in-beekeeping
3/27/2022,"A little more than a year ago, River Streader swapped a Coburg sharehouse for one in Kangaroo Point – returning to their hometown of Brisbane after a decade in Melbourne. The 30-year-old spent their time in Melbourne working as psychotherapist, tattoo artist and punk musician, while previously voting Greens, independent and “Labor-ish”. Now Streader is among a pandemic-era wave of interstate migrants arriving in Queensland in numbers not seen in almost two decades. In 2020, more than 30,000 Australians moved to Queensland, largely from Victoria and New South Wales, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In the 12 months to last September, ABS data shows Queensland’s population growing by almost 57,800 people, accounting for 84% of regional growth. This is in a period that Victoria’s population fell by more than 32,700 people. Like Streader, most moved to the state’s populated south-east, an area home to the majority of its most contested federal seats. And their arrival precedes a federal election that the University of Queensland’s Chris Salisbury believes will see “a correction” back towards Labor after the party’s “dire” performance in Queensland in 2019, when the state swung heavily to the LNP. Though it “won’t go down well” in regional areas where there are seats to watch – Flynn, Leichhardt, Herbert and Capricornia among them – the political historian says the change would be felt mostly “in and around the capital”, Brisbane. “That’s really where Labor’s gravity pulls in Queensland, federally at least,” Salisbury tells the Guardian. So how will an influx of tens of thousands of new and returned Queenslanders play into that expected correction – and which seats might they impact? In an attempt to answer that question, Griffith University’s policy innovation hub director, Susan Harris Rimmer, says her researchers are turning their minds back to 1993, the year almost 50,000 Australians moved to Queensland after Jeff Kennett took the axe to Victoria’s public service. “Victorians were moving to Queensland for lifestyle reasons, but they brought their politics with them,” Rimmer says. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She says those politics revolved around a “stronger and more nuanced rights discourse”. “Victoria is more socially progressive generally,” Rimmer says. “Issues around multiculturalism, ethnicity, First Nations issues … [and] policing issues are different from up here.” They’re subjects that interest Streader, who listed police accountability, challenging racist and sexist norms and the climate emergency as the issues upon affecting the way they vote. “I care about some sort of action happening, away from just the middle Liberal-Labor hodgepodge,” Streader says. “Last time, I remember voting for people expanding the safe injecting room, so sometimes it’s things like that. “Housing will be a big one at the moment.” Streader will cast their ballot later this year in the seat of Griffith. Labor’s Terri Butler retained the seat with a margin of less than 3% in 2019. That was a win for which Butler could thank the preferences of Greens voters. The Labor incumbent polled almost 10,000 fewer primary votes than her LNP opponent, but a 6.67% swing to the Greens saw her retain the seat formerly held by Kevin Rudd. It was the second consecutive swing of more than 6% to the Greens, whose primary vote in Griffith in 2019 was 23.65%. That trend is part of a long-term demographic change threatening LNP seats in Brisbane’s inner city, Rimmer says. Both the Greens and Labor are understood to be optimistic about their chances in the seat of Brisbane, and the Greens are also eyeing nearby Ryan. Rimmer says the migration of progressive voters from southern states could play into the growing Greens vote in Ryan – but its 6% margin places the seat only just within the realms of that considered marginal. And not all of Queensland’s new arrivals will bring left-leaning politics with them. Sally Branson Dalwood and her family uprooted from St Kilda for a new life on the Gold Coast late last year. She, for one, cannot be relied upon to bolster the Greens vote – she was once state director of the Victorian National party and an adviser to former PM Tony Abbott. The family left Melbourne after Jonathan Dalwood, 40, felt forced to close his cake manufacturing business just days after the state went into lockdown. Branson Dalwood runs her own business consultancy and can work from anywhere. After reflecting upon their lives, the family decided to head north. The entrepreneur says her priorities had changed since becoming a mother to two young boys. “I feel very strongly about women in entrepreneurship, women in business, equality, equal pay,” she says. “And I feel really strongly about making sure we are a caring and compassionate society, whilst also having some robust economic policy.” But Branson Dalwood says others she knows who have left Canberra and Melbourne for the sunshine state also made the move because their “financial wherewithal was riding on having their small business open” and they were sick of “living in fear of lockdown”. “They are very libertarian,” she says. Branson Dalwood will cast her vote in the seat of Fadden, held by the employment minister, Stuart Robert, with a healthy margin of 14.2%. The neighbouring seat of Forde, however, is less secure. The LNP’s Bert Van Manen held it handsomely in 2019 with a swing of almost 8%. Three years earlier, in 2016, Van Manen won the seat by a margin of 0.6% – or just 1,026 votes. Then there’s the seat of Longman, north of Brisbane, which is one of two electorates won by the LNP from Labor in 2019. Covering the hinterland area around Woodford, as well as Caboolture and Bribie Island, it is held by Terry Young by a margin of 3.3%, making it the LNP’s most marginal seat in Queensland. Since 2007 it has swapped hands four times. In 2016, Labor had won it with a margin of 0.8% – or 1,390 votes. If Salisbury is correct about a return to those kinds of margins, new arrivals like Streader and Branson Dalwood could determine which way the vote swings. Come polling day, it might just be a Longman or a Brisbane that proves decisive. Salisbury says only a few of Queensland’s federal seats “generally and historically” changed hands in any given poll – with the exception of “watershed elections” such as in 2007 when the state’s own Kevin Rudd swept to power. “In Queensland, we really do just stick to the status quo here, and I don’t get the sense that there is a massive mood for change in Queensland yet,” he says. “If it is a bit more of a correction election, I don’t see a huge number of seats falling.”",News/Australia news,‘They brought their politics with them’: will Queensland’s newest residents affect the election?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/they-brought-their-politics-with-them-will-queenslands-newest-residents-affect-the-election
3/27/2022,"Every morning, when I am first downstairs, I miss her anew. There is a particular kind of nothing in the corner that, until two weeks ago, housed her beanbag nest. That hollowness matches the echo in my chest. Each morning brings a fresh pang of grief: the dog is still dead, will always be dead. My wife says that was her first thought on waking for the first week: Moxy is dead. Moxy is dead. When it stopped, she felt worse. This was no longer news; it just was. She felt guilty that we might adjust to Moxy’s absence, that it might feel normal to be without her. This is the guilt of forgetting. There is a lot of guilt around the death of a dog. And a lot of awkwardness. For every hot, sharp stab of loss comes another of shame — a sense of self-indulgence. Real tragedies abound. People lose whole families. She was “just a dog”. There are no rules for measuring grief around the death of a pet. There is no formal leave, no general understanding that performing as a human being becomes more or less impossible for — how long? — days, or weeks? I’ve long been aware that private sadness is an affront to many people, met with fear of contagion or anger that you’re killing their buzz (“Aren’t you over that yet?”). This seems particularly acute when the cause of your sadness is “just” a pet. In the days after Moxy died, there were a few people who were in a hurry to move the conversation on. One family member met my wife’s sadness with, “Oh, is that all?” That said, I’ve been touched this time by how many have understood that a dog becomes part of a family. Nobody’s dog is “just a dog”. That compassion has been a balm. It has helped give me the confidence to experience the grief, rather than shrug it off. Moxy was the first living creature my wife and I loved together. She was a small Boston terrier: fierce, playful and affectionate. When we bought her, pre-children, we fulfilled every cliche of the doting doggy parent. Moxy rode around in a basket on the back of our bikes wearing “doggles” (yes, dog-goggle sunglasses to protect her bulbous eyes). We bought her a dog baby-carrier (she hated it). When we left her at a luxury dog resort while we holidayed in San Francisco, we spent the whole month looking at pictures of her. We stopped visiting friends who wouldn’t let us bring her with us. And then we had children. This has been a major source of guilt in the past weeks. While, of course, we still loved her, there can be no question the dog was demoted the day we brought our first daughter home. When parenting became all-consuming, having to spare time and care for another dependant often felt too much. After Moxy died, I thought of all those moments of impatience and frustration, the evenings she was left sulking in the corner because we were too tired or too burgled of affection. Did she feel loved? Could we have loved her more? I had meant to make those moments up to her. I had thought there would be time. This is another source of guilt — the inability to explain things to a pet. The love of a dog is pure and simple. How could we explain to Moxy that we still loved her? How could we comfort her during her short but savage illness (a brain tumour) when we couldn’t tell her what was happening? Could she have understood what was going on during that final vet visit — or that last hour we spent as a family in the park so she could feel grass beneath her feet one more time? The worst part of a dog’s death is the pragmatism it forces on you as a carer. It underlines the divide between human and animal. I loved her, but I still carried her into the vet and lay her on the table. I lay her on the rug that was waiting, that I only realised later was her shroud. It was a kindness, but it felt brutal. I can’t imagine what it must be like to make those calls on behalf of another human being. I am familiar with the slowing down that happens in crisis. What struck me about the instant of Moxy’s death was how fast it was. There were no long moments. She didn’t fade away so much as switch off. The vet wrapped her up and we left the room. I held my wife. I held the children. Parenting is often having every emotion at once without surrendering to any of them. I was preoccupied in the moment with managing my children’s grief, while feeling overwhelmed by my own. As a journo, I felt like I was having to write and edit at the same time, tenderly reshaping the experience as it happened. Maybe I was wrong to try. Our youngest said she had never seen me cry before. That felt important. The final gift a dog gives its family is the lesson of loss. The knowledge that a story isn’t devalued by its ending. All that love still happens. Our kids have been given a knot of complex emotions and, as hard as it has been, it has been extraordinary watching them untangle that knot. Our eldest, who has a tendency to shut down difficult emotion, has expressed her grief in painting and poetry. Our youngest is learning that raging against the dying of the light doesn’t turn the light back on. I have no doubt both the girls will be better people for the knowing of Moxy — and the losing of her. For me, losing our dog has been a reminder of the importance of the real, at a time when it feels easy to lose yourself in the virtual. Loss is intensely physical. Memories and stories are solace, but it’s the weight of the warm body that is forever missed; Moxy’s sounds and her smells (some less missed than others). The house feels still, almost stagnant; no longer haunted by her warm footsteps. I see her in shadows, hear her in sounds and scratches. The dog is gone. But she is in me. She is woven into the lives of my children. I am grateful for the lessons she taught us. For her love. For the grief I barely feel entitled to. Thanks, Moxy. We miss you.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The painful loss of my dog gave me confidence to experience grief rather than shrug it off | Myke Bartlett,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/27/the-painful-loss-of-my-dog-gave-me-confidence-to-experience-grief-rather-than-shrug-it-off
3/27/2022,"Matt Holding set an alarm on his phone so he wouldn’t miss out on a limited release of electric vehicles, but by the time he jumped online to buy one they had sold out. In six and a half minutes, all 109 of Hyundai’s electric SUVs had sold – 18,000 Australians had registered their interest. “You’ve just got to keep on trying and get in there straight away, which seems ridiculous when you’re purchasing an $80,000 car,” Holding says of the second time he tried to beat the queue to buy Hyundai’s Ioniq 5. The pace at which the cars sold out is part of a broader issue, according to leaders in the industry, as the demand for them in Australia now outstrips supply. “Our biggest issue now is actually attracting supply of electric vehicles, not getting Australians interested in buying them,” says Behyad Jafari, the chief executive of the Electric Vehicle Council. Jafari says Australia is underserved in EVs compared with many other countries due to a lack of government EV and climate policies. The majority of EVs are instead flowing to countries that require car manufacturers to sell them in order to meet fuel efficiency standards and CO2 emission reduction schemes. The UK has banned the sale of all new petrol-run cars by 2030, in South Korea the date is 2025. Last year, the Morrison government announced it would partner with the private sector to fund 50,000 EV charging stations in homes, 500 for businesses and 1,000 in public areas. This is one part of the government’s $2.1bn funded future fuels and vehicle strategy. A spokesperson for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the strategy will make “it easier for Australians to make the choice to switch to a new technology vehicle that’s right for them”. But Australia remains the only country in the OECD not to have fuel efficiency standards for CO2. Nor has Australia adopted the Euro 6 noxious emission standards on fuel quality, which was applied to all new cars sold in the EU more than six years ago. “Australia is not in the race,” says Jafari. “Our partners in the US and Europe and right around the world have a much easier time because there’s a requirement for them to get enough electric vehicles into their markets.” Last year carmakers warned there would be production cuts due to supply chain issues resulting from the pandemic. But Hyundai Australia’s general manager of corporate affairs, Bill Thomas, says the fact that there are not enough EVs available in Australia is mainly due to a lack of incentives to sell the cars here, rather than supply chain issues. In Australia, there is a six to nine-month wait on Tesla models. Car manufacturer Kia could only secure 500 of its new electric SUVs this year despite 20,000 Australians expressing interest. When Nathan Gore-Brown, an EV consultant, saw Honda confirm they had no plans to sell the electric car he wanted in Australia – the Honda E – he decided to import a used one from the UK. It cost between $15,000 and $20,000 to bring the almost $45,000 car to Australia. Gore-Brown says a major issue stalling EV uptake is that Australia does not get the same choice of models as many other countries, and what is sent here is often delayed. Car manufacturer Škoda announced their electric SUV Enyaq would be sold in Australia in 2023, three years after it was first sold in the UK. Thomas says the demand for Hyundai’s EVs has gradually increased since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent petrol prices soaring. “We’re seeing more discussions about EVs on the showroom floor,” he says. “People are coming in to look at cars and they’re much more likely to talk about the potential for an EV, even more than they were two weeks ago.” Hyundai has requested more EVs for the Australian market, but does not yet have confirmation they will be delivered. It hopes to secure a version of the Ioniq 5 model that is lower in price later this year. Jafari says without government leadership on EVs, Australians have been left in a risky position. “Every year that we go on with Australians buying petrol vehicles, they’re at risk of buying a new vehicle that in four or five years’ time will be worthless … no one will want to buy it because it’s redundant technology,” he says. “There essentially needs to be a warning that people are buying landlines when the world is moving towards mobile phones.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Due to the difficulty in securing an EV that was right for Holding’s family of four and a dog, he bought an internal combustion engine car four months ago to get him by. “I did need a car, and it got the point I just couldn’t wait any more,” he says. A spokesperson for the energy minister, Angus Taylor, said supply chain constraints were a global problem affecting vehicles and components. “Despite these constraints, Australians already have the confidence to make the choice to drive an EV,” they said. “Battery EV sales are soaring, having tripled from 2020 to 2021.” The spokesperson said the government’s modern manufacturing strategy was working to overcome global constraints and strengthen local production.",News/Environment,Sold out: why Australia doesn’t have enough electric vehicles to go around,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/27/sold-out-why-australia-doesnt-have-enough-electric-vehicles-to-go-around
3/27/2022,"When Adolf Hitler was ascendant, the American foreign correspondent Dorothy Thompson invented the “macabre parlour game” of guessing who would “go Nazi” if the Germans invaded. With Vladimir Putin, there is no need to imagine who would collaborate, as so many have already collaborated with the Russian propaganda effort. Some were convinced ideologues. Others were has-been politicians such as Alex Salmond and George Galloway: conceited old men, grateful that Putin’s RT (Russia Today) network still wanted to broadcast them. The rest were not has-beens but never-beens: wannabe pundits the national media would not touch; TV presenters who never had star billing; desperate young reporters who could not break into the UK’s exploitative media sector. TV journalists are actors with notebooks. There is no hiding place on stage or in the news anchor’s chair. The failure to succeed is deeply personal because, however vigorously you try to blame others, the public’s reluctance to clamour for your company can only be the result of your own failings. Bill Dod exemplified RT presenters who moved between jobs on local and consumer channels until RT offered them a national platform. Its staff took the opportunity because RT exploited vanities most of us feel unless we have achieved a rare serenity. The vanity of the passed over. The vanity of men and women who believed society would reward them if they worked hard and obeyed its rules, only to find it ignored them after they had done both. Russia gave them new rules to obey and rewarded them with money and, as joyous to the ego, recognition. All it asked in return is that they never asked hard questions about their paymasters. RT offered Alex Rees his first job as an assistant producer in 2017. His £25,000 salary was better than just getting by on the one-off commissions many young journalists must endure. The UK operation focused on Brexit, Scottish nationalism, culture wars and unilateral disarmament: anything, in short, that weakened Britain. No newsroom commissar dictated the party line. Alex told me staff at the grand London studios in Millbank, just down the road from parliament, would pitch ideas. The management would return with the authorised news list. In theory, his boss was a Ukrainian, who resigned when Russian missiles taught her the hard way not to believe the propaganda she spread. But Alex’s impression was that “people we never saw made the editorial decisions. Maybe in London, maybe in Moscow.” He began to have doubts when Russian agents launched a chemical weapons attack with novichok on Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018. If the London journalists had a conscience, they could soothe it by saying that their work just about complied with broadcasting standards. But Moscow accompanied their reporting with packages of hacks standing outside factories saying the nerve agent could have been made in the Czech Republic or come from the British research lab at Porton Down – from anywhere and everywhere except Russia. And then there were the studio guests. George Galloway was as reliable an apologist for Putin as he was for Bashar al-Assad and Saddam Hussein – “the man’s search for a tyrannical fatherland never ends”, as Christopher Hitchens once said. Galloway duly derided the truth about Russian crimes on RT and the broadcasting regulators duly censured him. But Galloway was not a typical figure. Most people over 30 know who he is, just as most could pick RT contributor Nigel Farage from a police identification parade. I challenge you to put a face to Neil Clark, Craig Murray and so many other useful idiots on the RT sofa. Clark was a typically disappointed figure from our media-saturated age. He was a jobbing teacher at a crammer helping the children of the upper middle class scrape into Oxbridge. He spent his evenings far from the world of power politics at meetings of Oxfordshire’s North Hinksey parish council, complaining that a fellow councillor had the impertinence to call him a “plonker” or that a member of the public had said he was “pathetic”. The leftish press of the day briefly ran his pieces defending the war criminal Slobodan Milošević as a “prisoner of conscience”. But the market for whitewashing crimes against humanity was limited. The dreary meeting rooms of North Hinksey beckoned, until RT gave him a platform, which allowed him to put failure behind him and show all who had snubbed him that Clark was a man to be reckoned with. Did I hear you say you would never deal with the devil to confound your enemies? Are you sure about that? Craig Murray is an equally symptomatic figure. I defended him in 2002 when he was Britain’s ambassador in Uzbekistan and found the moral courage to criticise the tyrannical practices of the Uzbek dictatorship. It was pouring boiling water over prisoners while remaining the west’s ally in democracy’s war against radical Islam. Naturally, Murray didn’t last long in the Foreign Office after that outburst. If you had asked me at the time, I would have said that, as a brave and principled figure, Murray would go on to defend human rights whether the west or the west’s enemies oppressed them. But like so many others he was prepared to expose western crimes while covering for Putin. If I make him sound a hypocrite, then he is hardly an exceptional hypocrite. The west kids itself if it thinks Ukraine enjoys global support. Millions in Africa, Asia, South America and in the west itself will excoriate the double standards of democracies while excusing or ignoring the crimes of dictatorships. You may object that it is unfair to pick on propagandists when the bankers, lawyers and estate agents who laundered Russian money remain anonymous. But journalists, like actors and athletes, are visible. Scrutiny goes with the job. Accept it or quit. You might say that belatedly, even by the lax standards of a cynical world, RT journalists are speaking out against Putin and have called time on their collaboration. For all that, they remain important and quietly frightening figures. Although some thrilled to Putin’s violence, most of RT’s employees served the world’s mightiest crime gang while remaining average people with everyday concerns. Their story is a warning to guard against power worship and subservience: not just in those around us but in ourselves.

3/27/2022,"Jamie Jones-Buchanan had spoken passionately about how this Challenge Cup tie presented Leeds Rhinos with an opportunity to alter their focus and reinvigorate their season. But by the end, this had an eerily familiar feeling to so much we have seen from one of rugby league’s biggest clubs in 2022 as their involvement in the cup was ruthlessly ended by Castleford Tigers at the first hurdle. It is perhaps unsurprising that, in a week that began with the first coaching casualty of the year with Richard Agar departing Headingley on Monday, it ends with more questions than answers surrounding Leeds. Who finds those answers remains to be seen as Leeds conduct a worldwide search for Agar’s successor but, despite the final scoreline suggesting some semblance of competitiveness here, they will be alarmed by what was on show here. Jones-Buchanan, who won everything with the club as a player, said that tough times in his own career had steeled him for his first game as interim head coach. Yet nothing could have prepared him for what he saw in a disastrous first half, which ended with Leeds 28-0 behind and left them with too much work to do to set up a quarter-final tie with Hull Kingston Rovers. That honour instead belonged to Castleford, who were worthy winners courtesy of the best half they have strung together since Lee Radford arrived in the off-season. Leeds’s frailties were best summed up early on; some early promise came to very little and when they conceded first at the opposite end courtesy of Jake Trueman’s try, their game fell apart. Jake Mamo crossed next and when Gareth O’Brien scampered through after a fine offload from Liam Watts, Leeds were 16-0 behind and in real danger. Their problems only worsened when Brad Dwyer was sen to the sin-bin for a trip four minutes before half-time and in those four minutes Castleford put the result beyond doubt. They scored back-to-back tries, first when the outstanding Kenny Edwards offloaded for Jordan Turner before yet more horrendous defending created the gap for George Lawler to score Castleford’s fifth and make it 28-0 in the Tigers’ favour. Leeds at least restored some pride to an extent thereafter. Two quick tries after the break, for Rhyse Martin and Liam Sutcliffe, narrowed the deficit but you never felt Leeds were capable of a comeback, not least due to their shortcomings in defence. They were exposed again on the hour mark when Greg Eden plucked out a tame Aidan Sezer pass to intercept and firmly take the wind out of Leeds’s sails. Martin scored his second soon after but fittingly, Castleford rounded off the scoring when Eden claimed his second in the final moments. The highly rated Australian, Ryan Carr, is among those under consideration to succeed Agar but whether it is Carr or someone else, the next coach of this famous old club will be inheriting a very worrying situation indeed. In Saturday’s other ties, holders St Helens overcame resistance from Championship part-timers Whitehaven to secure a 46-4 victory. The holders had a few uneasy moments in the early stages but their extra fitness and finesse proved too much for the home side as they cruised through with eight different tryscorers. Catalans were pushed all the way by a spirited Featherstone in Perpignan and left it late to book their place in the quarter-finals with a hard-fought 27-14 win. Tries in the last 20 minutes from Tyrone May and Tom Davies spared the Dragons’ blushes against a rugged and resilient Rovers. Hull KR earned their spot in the next round via a tough 24-18 victory over Leigh Centurions. The 2015 Wembley runners-up needed the inspiration of half-back Mikey Lewis to turn the tie in their favour after Leigh dominated the first 20 minutes. A Jake Connor masterclass and Connor Wynne’s hat-trick helped Hull FC ease into the last eight for an eighth season in a row after a 58-12 triumph at Championship side Sheffield Eagles. The quarter-final draw pitted Warrington or Wakefield v Wigan, Hull KR v Castleford, Barrow or Huddersfield v Hull FC, and Catalans v St Helens.",Sport/Sport,Castleford crush Leeds to book Challenge Cup quarter-final spot,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/leeds-castleford-rugby-league-challenge-cup-match-report
3/27/2022,"The rubbish collectors in Kharkiv wear flak jackets now. Several of their trucks are peppered with shrapnel holes from shells that landed during their rounds. The bins they empty are packed with the shattered, twisted remains of homes destroyed by explosions. But still, every morning they go out to keep Kharkiv clean. Ukraine’s second city is perhaps the most-shelled target in the country after besieged Mariupol. Every day brings a hail of Grad rockets, cluster bombs, shells and missiles. Hundreds are dead, thousands injured. The morgues cannot cope with the daily toll inflicted by Russia. At one city-centre facility, dozens of bodies, wrapped only in plastic bags or blankets, are stacked in a courtyard. Yet Kharkiv’s people are determined that their city will stand, that life must continue among the ruins, even if for now it is a terrifying half-existence in the shadow of sudden death. And that means keeping the city clean. “They can bomb us for as long as they want: we will withstand it,” said Ihor Aponchuk, a driver whose collection round now takes in ghostly neighbourhoods of empty playgrounds and a shelled school just short of the front line. A few hours after Aponchuk emptied the first set of bins near the Heroes of Labour metro station in eastern Kharkiv, a rocket hit people queuing for aid about 500 metres away, killing six and leaving the pavement smeared with blood. The next day the city’s main Barabashovo market was set alight, and four died when a shell landed outside a clinic. In Ukrainian cities less directly touched – or less terribly ravaged – by the war, there is a cheery defiance. In Kharkiv, death is too close and too frequent for that. Men and women who are drawing on extraordinary reserves of courage to go about their lives, openly admit that the situation is terrifying. Yet they and hundreds of thousands of others have chosen to stay in their “hero city” – a title first awarded to Kharkiv for its resistance to Nazi troops in the second world war, and bestowed again by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this month for its courage standing up to Russia’s invasion. “We are scared, but we need to show people that the situation is under control and every day we are getting closer to victory,” said governor Oleh Synyehubov, who spoke to the Observer while walking in a city centre park under light police guard. Aponchuk, who has had a couple of near misses with Russian rockets, said: “I understand the fear.” But Kharkiv has a reputation as a “clean city”, and he believes keeping it that way is vital for morale, as well as public hygiene. So he and over 250 others head out each day, risking their lives with a matter-of-fact dedication similar to that displayed by Londoners who kept milk deliveries going during the second world war’s blitz. “A driver came under heavy shelling the other day, so he drove back to base here, had a cup of tea, then went out on another route,” said Oleksii Artikulenko, a city employee seconded a month ago to keep waste collection operating through the war. Less than 40 miles from the Russian border, Kharkiv is traditionally a Russian-speaking town, and Moscow apparently expected its forces to be welcomed there. Instead they met heavy resistance. Pinned into the city’s north and east, they began targeting civilians and the centre, inflicting damage on everything from the zoo to the cathedral and a Holocaust memorial. A missile hollowed out Kharkiv’s city hall. Rockets punched holes in apartment blocks and destroyed smaller homes. “When it was clear that they weren’t going to be able to take it, they started a campaign of terror,” Synyehubov said. “Kharkiv will be even more beautiful, with better buildings and infrastructure, I have no doubt. The thing that upsets me is deaths. It is straightforward to restore things, but not to restore families.” Officials estimate that well over half of the city’s 1.4 million population has left. Trains alone carried nearly half of them, 600,000 people, to the west, and many more left by car. But that still leaves a city of hundreds of thousands, living mostly inside, or underground, who have refused to go. They want to keep the city’s spirit alive for themselves, and to support soldiers on the front lines nearby, and they want to start rebuilding, or at least clearing up the wreckage of recent strikes, so that Kharkiv doesn’t feel abandoned. Serhiy, a fireman, spent his 29th birthday last Thursday clearing the shattered remains of the imposing Soviet-era city hall: 30 bodies have been pulled from the wreckage. By evening, he said, he would be back on duty putting out fires:“I’ll celebrate my birthday with a cup of tea. We haven’t had a day off in a month. They have offered us a break but we don’t want to take it.” Nearby, teams were sandbagging a 10 metre-high statue of poet and Ukrainian hero Taras Shevchenko. “For me the city was wonderful,” said Yevhen Yurgens, 56, as he helped fill the sandbags. “Look how the Russians destroyed it. We want to protect it as much as we can.” The city feels like the end of the line for Ukraine’s war. The highway from the industrial hub of Dnipro, which sweeps through rich farmland, is now virtually empty. You can drive for miles without seeing a car or lorry. Reports of Russian ambush groups and shelling, even on the relatively safe southern approach to the town, make the journey tense, and people organising aid say they have trouble recruiting drivers to make the run. So while the city is not officially under siege, it is running low on food and medicine. International organisations such as the UN and the Red Cross seem conspicuous mostly by their absence. “We’ve been left to ourselves here essentially,” says Synyehubov. “We get 100 tonnes of humanitarian aid each day, but 40 tonnes of it are clothes, which we don’t need.” They need five times as much food and medicine as they are getting. For now, the city’s more vulnerable residents are being kept alive largely by informal networks of volunteers like Tetiana Medveyeva, 33, and Stanislav Manilov, 28. The couple went to the station on the first day of the war, planning to head west, but ended up staying. “We saw so many people trying to get on the train with their pets and families,” Manilov said. “We looked each other in the eyes, and agreed that others needed to leave more than us. And at that point we decided not to go, and to be useful here.” They connected with some activists they knew before the war, and began preparing food packages for the old and disabled who might struggle to leave home or afford food, paid for by private donations raised online. “We have been doing this since 26 February, and it feels like it has been going on forever.” They spend their mornings buying and packing food bags, and the afternoons handing them out. With most jobs vanished overnight, and old people unable to get their pensions from closed post offices, the scale of the need is terrifying. When their van draws up, people will come running to secure a bag containing pasta and a couple of cans of fish and meat. “In other areas, people are more desperate,” Medveyeva said. “They attack the van, and shout at us if they don’t get food.” A month ago she was an administrator and he worked in an architectural design company. Now they live off dwindling savings and, increasingly, the food packages they prepare for other vulnerable locals. They are so used to driving around under bombardment they don’t flinch even when shells land nearby. “We don’t have a normal reaction any more,” Medveyeva said.",News/World news,Kharkiv citizens: ‘They can bomb us for as long as they want: we will withstand it’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/we-decided-to-be-useful-ukraine-the-kharkiv-citizens-who-stayed-behind
