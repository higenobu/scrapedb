5/20/2022,"The New South Wales government underspent on personal protective equipment and mental health services and forked out close to $200m on faulty imported masks and ventilators as part of the state’s $7.5bn pandemic expenditure, a review has found. The auditor general released a detailed report on Friday after examining the state’s spending from the first case detected in January 2020 to the middle of 2021. It found that while NSW government agencies were provided with $9.7bn to spend on Covid measures, a lower amount of $7.5bn was used over the period, with most going to direct health response measures, PPE, quarantine and cleaning. The audit found that hits to the bottom line meant the government was “unlikely to meet” some of its fiscal goals. “The Covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted the financial performance and position of state government agencies,” the report stated. It found the government paid more than $130m to private operators to make up for the approximate $80m a week in lost revenue from Opal card users when public transport use dropped. The audit found the government had set aside $433m to buy PPE for healthcare workers but underspent by almost $180m. It also found only $51m of the state’s $69m mental health package was used. The government also forked out $159m for masks from overseas that did not meet regulatory standards, and more than $20m on faulty ventilators, also bought from overseas, that were “not performing in accordance with the supplier’s operation manual”. The report found that Treasury did not issue guidance for Covid-19 expenditure or on how to record and monitor spending.

5/20/2022,"Mice with spinal cord injuries have shown remarkable recovery after being given a drug initially developed for people with lung disease, researchers have revealed, saying the treatment could soon be tested on humans. It is thought there are around 2,500 new spinal cord injuries in the UK every year, with some of those affected experiencing full loss of movement as a result. Despite a number of promising areas of research, at present damage to the spinal cord is not reversible. Now researchers at the University of Birmingham say a drug called AZD1236, initially developed to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in humans, has shown promise in mice with spinal cord compression injuries, a type of injury often associated with motor accidents in humans, but which is also linked to conditions such as osteoarthritis. A similar drug, called AZD3342, showed comparable benefits in rats. The results, published in the journal Clinical and Translational Medicine, suggest the drugs block the action of enzymes known as MMP-9 and MMP-12 that rise after spinal cord injury. The upshot is that swelling of the spinal cord was reduced, levels of proteins linked to inflammation and pain were lowered, and breakdown of the blood-spinal cord barrier was limited. Scarring of connective tissue was also reduced. The team add that compared with injured mice not given AZD1236, those given the drug for three days showed 85% improvement in movement and sensation six weeks after the spinal injury, while their nerve function was 80% of that seen in uninjured mice. Furthermore, the benefits were similar whether the drug was given immediately after spinal injury or 24 hours later. “What we’re doing is we’re dampening down the damage to the nerve tissues. That way, we’re preserving more and more of the neurons,” said Prof Zubair Ahmed of the University of Birmingham, a co-author of the study. Ahmed said the findings were exciting, adding that because AZD1236 had already been shown to be safe in humans, it could enter human trials sooner. “Five to six years and this could be a potential treatment, if everything goes well,” he said. Dr Mariel Purcell, a consultant in spinal injuries who was not involved in the work, welcomed the findings, although she cautioned that the results were, so far, limited to rodents and it was not yet clear whether similar benefits would be seen in humans. “Spinal cord injury is a truly devastating life-altering injury with unfortunately little that can be done to limit the primary consequences of injury such as paralysis and sensory impairment,” she said. “Translating this intervention into newly injured patients seems eminently practical, as the effect of AZD1236 is maintained even if not administered until 24 hours post-injury and the course of treatment is short at three days. It’s wonderful to see such exciting results.”",News/Science,Recovery of mice raises hopes drug could help people with spinal injuries,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/20/recovery-of-mice-raises-hopes-drug-could-help-people-with-spinal-injuries
5/20/2022,"Star Wars has a new set of rules, and it’s nothing to do with what the Jedi and Sith are permitted to do to stay on the right side of the Force. Kathleen Kennedy , head of Lucasfilm,has told Vanity Fair that the studio no longer thinks it is acceptable to recast legacy characters from the original trilogy, as it did when Alden Ehrenreich was cast as Han Solo in the misfiring 2018 spinoff film. “Some people have talked about how Solo should have been a TV show. But even doing Solo as a TV show without Harrison Ford as Han Solo … it’s the same thinking,” Kennedy said. “Maybe I should have recognised this before. We would never make Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford. Having just finished the fifth movie, there wasn’t a day I wasn’t on set where I wasn’t like, ‘Yes – this is Indiana Jones.’” Kennedy also confirmed that the studio would not be looking to recast Luke Skywalker: “Just staying within the construct of George’s storytelling, to keep chipping away at that, I think would be wrong. It’s our job to step away now, but still have a connection to the mythology that George created. That won’t stop. But we are moving on from the Skywalker saga. That’s what’s taking a lot of time.” There will be few arguments from fans here, and it’s intriguing to see that Lucasfilm has finally worked out that Star Wars is not the same as that other great Disney-owned franchise, Marvel, and needs to be treated differently. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been character-based from the beginning: even the titles themselves focus on an individual superhero or a superhero collective. Star Wars titles, at least until recently, always focused on the plot. So it made no real sense to suddenly start pumping out movies designed to feed off fans’ fondness for specific characters who were only interesting for the part they played in the big picture. Star Wars’ advantage over Marvel, however, is that it is the far-out, homespun fantasy mythology that fans are most in love with. Yes, they adore figures such as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Darth Vader, but Star Wars still exists without them, as Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian has proved. Remove Spider-Man, Iron Man and Captain America from the MCU, and, at the very least, there will be questions asked about which heroes are primed and ready to step up and replace them. Let’s just imagine for a moment that instead of deciding to make a movie about the early years of Han Solo, Lucasfilm had worked out which Star Wars story it really wanted to tell and then focused on which legacy characters to include. It might well have been that the recasting problem disappeared, or at least rapidly diminished. I’m a huge fan of the Christian Bale take on Batman, but it didn’t bother me when Robert Pattinson took on the role, because Matt Reeves’ The Batman has something fresh and vital to say about the character, and stands out from anything that’s come before. So, are we going to be stuck with a digitally de-aged Mark Hamill as Luke for the foreseeable future? You’ll hear no complaints here if digi-Hamill keeps turning up as a supporting character in future Mandalorian episodes, so well was that particular project realised in the recent The Book of Boba Fett. But if Lucasfilm was able to find a fascinating new story for Skywalker that did require a recasting, most fans would probably swallow it. In any case, it already looks as if Luke will be recast to an extent (as a child) in the upcoming Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+ show, though it’s possible we’ll only see the new version in passing. Perhaps it is better that Star Wars movies shift away from the Skywalkers where they can, because that story really has been told so many times that even the wisest Jedi might start to lose patience. And yet, Solo wasn’t a failure because of the absence of Harrison Ford. It bombed because nobody understood the point of its existence, and because the film-makers’ half-hearted attempts at convincing us it was worth watching proved about as useless as Jar Jar Binks in the Galactic Senate. More Star Wars movies are inevitably coming, and some (like the excellent Rogue One) will almost certainly turn out to be joyous new additions to the canon. The lesson Lucasfilm needs to learn from its post-Lucas travails is that if there is no reason for making a new Star Wars film beyond box office returns they should probably leave well alone. Either that, or sign up Ford for the digital de-ageing process, and pay him whatever he needs to make it happen.",Arts/Film,Will Lucasfilm’s strange new rules help or hinder Star Wars?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/lucasfilms-star-wars-studio-casting
5/20/2022,"One sleep to go and how are people feeling? “The mood is tired – and the vibe is tired,” one political staffer said when asked how they were feeling at the end of the gruelling six-week campaign. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese spent Friday racing around marginal electorates in multiple states as they made their final pitches to voters. The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) and the special minister of state also raced to fix a surprising anomaly in the phone voting system for some people isolating with Covid. Here’s how Friday unfolded. Morrison spent the day in Western Australia, where Labor is hoping to take several seats from the Coalition. He first attended a community breakfast at Karawara in Swan, a Liberal-held seat that is tipped to fall to Labor. He visited the Jindalee housing estate in the Liberal-held seat of Pearce to promote his superannuation-for-housing policy. He visited Sikh Gurdawa Perth, a temple in Hasluck, attempting to shore up the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt. Morrison then stopped at a manufacturing business in the Labor-held seat of Cowan. He is expected to be in Melbourne overnight. Albanese undertook a three-state blitz of marginal seats, including the Liberal-held seats of Boothby and Sturt in South Australia and Bass in Tasmania. The Labor leader was expected to visit Victoria on Friday night – probably going to the Liberal-held seat of Chisholm. In South Australia, he brought some local firepower in the form of ex-PM Julia Gillard, who appealed directly to the women of Australia when saying an Albanese government would be one that “cares about, values and includes women”. You can read the latest campaign postcards from Paul Karp and Josh Butler who have been travelling with the leaders this week here. Pacific step too far: The Morrison government has been hit by an election-eve leak that cabinet’s national security committee blocked a proposal by the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, to double Australia’s support to the Pacific. Labor said the “extraordinary” pre-election leak, first reported by the Australian newspaper, showed the government was “falling apart”, while Morrison insisted the committee was “extremely tight” and denied extra funds would have averted China’s attempts to gain influence. Guardian Australia has confirmed that the proposal advanced by Payne included an approximate doubling of Australia’s total financial support to Pacific island countries over four years. Phone voting saga: Eligibility for telephone voting will be expanded to allow Covid-positive Australians to vote in Saturday’s election. The AEC admitted on Thursday that potentially more than 100,000 people could have been caught by an anomaly preventing them from voting – they tested positive after the cutoff to apply for a postal ballot but too soon to qualify for phone voting. But on Friday morning the AEC said it had recommended a solution to allow anyone who tested positive after 6pm last Friday to use telephone voting. Path to victory: With the polls tightening in the final days of the election campaign, both major parties are preparing for a tight contest on Saturday. Labor is desperately hoping the widespread anti-Morrison sentiment is enough to deliver it government under a “safe change” strategy that has seen the Labor leader adopt a small-target approach and run a low-key campaign. Chief political correspondent Sarah Martin has examined the seats Labor and the Coalition need for victory in this handy guide. What about the Senate? While the main focus of the election campaign has been on the House of Representatives, the makeup of the new Senate will be crucial to the success of the next government. Ben Raue explains the possibilities in this Senate scenario sheet. Voting guide: Everything you need to know, including how to vote if you have Covid. Cait Kelly has it covered in this comprehensive guide. Government by my way or the highway. “What do you mean by negotiate?” Morrison asks. Could be the quote of the campaign.#auspol CO2 emissions from coal per person in Australia in 2021, according to an Ember report, which put it at the highest per capita among developed countries. The interesting thing about the democracy sausage is that we have compulsory voting so there's no need to entice people to vote. Therefore the democracy sausage exists for no political reason. It exists solely because we, as a nation, love putting sausages in bread. #ausvotes Political editor Katharine Murphy joins Jane Lee to discuss the possible paths to victory for the election on Saturday.

5/20/2022,"Sonia Molina Sanchez, worked as housekeeper at the celebrity hotspot hotel Chateau Marmont for 10 years. She will never forget the night she was sexually harassed by a guest. “I knocked on a guest’s door and went inside, and as soon as I went inside something didn’t feel right,” said Molina Sanchez. “The guest was lying in bed as if he was about to go to sleep. I turned around and looked at him, and when I looked at him he was staring at me while masturbating. I felt violated, really disturbed, and just completely in shock.” She reported the incident to her management, but nothing was done. The guest was permitted to continue staying at the hotel. Molina Sanchez was laid off during the beginning of the pandemic and is still waiting to be recalled to her job. She is one of many hotel workers in Los Angeles advocating for a city-wide ballot petition that would mandate safety protections for hotel workers, limit workloads, set wage standards, and extend worker retention rules. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, hotel workers have been fighting for hotels to provide workers with panic buttons to protect them from sexual harassment and assault on the job. The ballot initiative would mandate that all hotels in LA to institute panic buttons and have a security guard on site to respond to any calls from workers, similar to ordinances passed in several surrounding cities. “Had I had a panic button back then, I would have been able to press it to get the help that I needed. But I didn’t have it, [because] it wasn’t offered to me,” she added. Martha Moran, a housekeeper at Chateau Marmont for 33 years, who is also still waiting to be recalled back to her job and has a pending claim against the hotel over a statewide recall ordinance, also says she experienced sexual harassment at work. “I had an experience where a guest tried to take advantage of me, tried to hug me, kiss me, get me to sleep with him. Having the protection of what a panic button would offer is necessary,” said Moran. “It’s been increasingly difficult for me to get through the pandemic. I gave 33 years of my life to that hotel.” A spokesperson for Chateau Marmont said the hotel currently provides panic buttons to housekeepers, but did not specify when those were brought in. The spokesperson said the hotel already adheres to most of what is proposed in the ballot initiative, and that 40 workers have been recalled to work so far. They added in an email: “We do not tolerate mistreatment of our employees and take all claims of harassment seriously.” The petition, which was submitted to the city of Los Angeles to qualify for the November ballot, received more than 100,000 signatures, a record for a ballot petition, according to Unite Here Local 11, a union representing more than 32,000 workers in the hospitality industry in the Los Angeles area. The union is hoping the Los Angeles city council adopts the initiative in lieu of a ballot amendment, given the widespread public support for it. The initiative would also extend minimum wage requirements of $17.64 an hour from hotels with 150 or more rooms to any hotels with 60 or more rooms, and cap daily workloads assigned to housekeepers by square footage. “Our decision as a union to move this initiative was to make the economic recovery more about workers’ needs rather than corporate greed,” said Kurt Petersen, co-president of Unite Here Local 11. Petersen said the hospitality industry received billions in Covid relief funds as many workers lost their jobs, income, or work hours, and while hotel corporate executives maintained or increased their multi-million dollar salaries. He also said several hotel companies have exploited the pandemic to lay off workers and rehire new ones without seniority at lower wages, and cut labor costs through reduced staffing. “Workers need to go back to work and to conditions that are fair, safe and secure,” he added. In response to the pandemic, many hotels eliminated daily room cleaning for guests, which hotel workers have criticized – many hotels have kept these policies in place in order to cut labor costs while increasing workloads for current staff. The ballot initiative would prevent hotels from implementing policies where guest rooms are not cleaned daily by staff. Cristina Velasquez, a housekeeper at the Hilton Garden Inn in Hollywood for four years, said daily room cleaning was cut at the beginning of the pandemic, where hotel rooms were only being serviced on the fourth or fifth day. Hilton executives have commented publicly about their desire to permanently cut labor costs in the wake of the pandemic. Velasquez was initially laid off in March 2020 due to Covid, and was brought back to work in the September. She and her co-workers successfully formed a union and won union recognition in November last year. Velasquez said: “Because Hilton eliminated automatic cleaning, there are days now where I walk into a room and it takes 45 minutes to an hour to clean because it hasn’t been serviced in days. When we serviced them every day it would take half an hour.” A spokesperson for Hilton did not comment specifically on the ballot initiative, but said in an email: “Daily housekeeping remains available to our guests, free of charge, across our hotels around the world. “Recognizing some guests may have varying levels of comfort with someone entering their rooms after they have checked in, Hilton offers guests the choice and control to request the housekeeping services they desire.”",News/US news,Los Angeles hotel workers fight for panic buttons amid sexual harassment,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/hotel-workers-panic-buttons-sexual-harassment
5/20/2022,"As Donald Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election, there were few officials more willing to help than Doug Mastriano, then a little-known Pennsylvania state senator. Mastriano, a retired army colonel first elected in 2019, regularly communicated with Trump in the weeks after the election. He helped arrange a pseudo-hearing weeks after election day in which the Trump campaign presented baseless claims of fraud. Mastriano helped facilitate a plan to appoint a fake set of electors in Pennsylvania for Trump after Joe Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes. He embraced and promoted a fringe, anti-democratic legal theory that state legislatures can override the results of an election and appoint its own electors. He was also at the US capitol on January 6, and helped bus supporters there. He pushed an unofficial review of election equipment that prompted the state to decertify election machines in a county. He has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee. He supported efforts to decertify the election, which is legally impossible. This week, Republican voters in Pennsylvania nominated Mastriano to be their governor. If elected this fall, there seems to be little doubt Mastriano would be willing to use his power to reject the results of a free and fair election in Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in US presidential elections. As governor, he would be responsible for certifying the election, and could refuse to sign off on an outcome he disagrees with. He would also be responsible for appointing a secretary of state, charged with overseeing elections in the state and signing off on the results. (Pennsylvania is one of three states where the secretary of state is appointed, not elected). “We really need voters to be paying attention to how dangerous it is to have someone in a position like the governor who does not believe in the elections or in our system, who has cast so much doubt on the 2020 elections and would be in a great position of power,” said Lizzie Ulmer, senior vice-president for communications at States United Action, which is tracking election deniers running for office across the US. “It’s really important to not fall into that trap of thinking ‘OK, these are really extreme candidates’. Because they’re not fringe candidates, they’re raising money. They’re campaigning on these issues.” David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said: “If a governor would not certify an election in which his candidate lost, which had been upheld by the courts and election officials throughout the state, that’s incredibly dangerous – period. That’s incredibly dangerous in a state where that governor gets to appoint the chief election official, who might share similar inclinations.” While Becker has said courts would ultimately thwart any effort to block the certification of a lawful election, Becker said he was worried about the confusion that would arise from a governor refusing to accept election results. “I am very concerned about what happens in the meantime. And what messages are used to inflame the base of the losing party to act in a way that is anti-democratic and perhaps violent,” he said. Mastriano is one of a number of candidates who refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election and are seeking elected offices in which they would play a key role in overseeing the 2024 election. Candidates in Michigan, Nevada, and Minnesota have already earned their party’s nomination and there is a closely-watched primary for the top election office in Georgia on Tuesday. “What we’ve seen is that there are a number of elected officials within the Republican caucus that are still advocating or supporting this notion that the 2020 presidential elections were stolen,” said Khalif Ali, the executive director of the Pennsylvania chapter of Common Cause. “We’re not just talking about a gubernatorial race, we’re talking about the very essence of democracy in this state and in this country.” Mastriano has embraced the possibility of getting to overturn an election, saying he already has a secretary of state picked out (he has declined to say who). “I get to appoint the secretary of state, who is delegated from me the power to make the corrections to elections, the voting logs and everything. I could decertify every machine in the state with the stroke of a pen,” he said in a March radio interview. “He’s saying that part out loud,” said Ulmer. “It goes to show just how prevalent and mainstream the far right and the big lie supporters have made this issue. It’s so wild to think about. They really are campaigning, raising money, and generating a lot of interest and support from carrying this thing forward.” Mastriano has also said he might “reset” voter registration in Pennsylvania and “start all over,” something that would likely violate federal law. He has pledged to eliminate the state’s contract with “compromised voting machine companies,” even though there’s no evidence any machines were compromised in 2020. He wants to end no-excuse mail-in voting, which passed the state legislature with Republican support. Mastriano, who grew up in New Jersey, joined the military in 1986, and was deployed to the West-German Czechoslovakia border before being sent to Iraq, according to a New Yorker profile of him last year. A few years ago, he began attending events hosted by the New Apostolic Reformation, a group whose goal it is “to return the United States to an idealized Christian past”, according to the New Yorker. He is often described as a christian nationalist, embracing the belief that America should be a Christian nation. Beyond elections, Mastriano has embraced other extreme policies. He has signaled his support for a complete ban on abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest. He railed against Covid-19 restrictions, at one point falsely questioning whether mRNA vaccines were actually vaccines. He has supported legislation that would require teaching the Bible in public schools, according to The New Yorker, and allow adoption agencies to discriminate against same-sex couples. If elected, Mastriano has pledged to be more conservative than some of the most conservative governors in the country. “You guys think Ron DeSantis is good? Amateur,” Mastriano cracked, adding: “We love you, Ron, but this is Pennsylvania. This is where the light of liberty was set in 1776, where this nation was born,” he said earlier this month, according to NBC News. He has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory, and spoke at a conference in April organized by far-right activists who have promoted the movement. Ulmer, from States United and Ali, from Common Cause, both said it would be a mistake to dismiss Mastriano as too extreme to win a statewide election. “I take every candidate who has won their party’s nomination seriously,” Ali said. “He’s made a number of inflammatory statements, and I think we should absolutely believe him and take him seriously as the Republican nominee.”",News/US news,Trump loyalist’s primary win prompts election fears in Pennsylvania,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-republican-governor-trump
5/20/2022,"The hackBeauty enthusiasts – and supermodel Bella Hadid – are reportedly using face tape and elastic to temporarily tighten their skin. The promiseThis old Hollywood hack has made a comeback, and several companies now sell ready-made tape-and-elastic kits. But is it a toxic TikTok trend too far? The testNot only does this trend perpetuate unrealistic ideals, it also culturally appropriates Asian features, which has become an unwelcome trend in cosmetic surgery. Still, I’m curious to know why it’s popular, so here goes. One method uses specific face tapes on an elastic band hidden in your hair and gives ultra-dramatic effects (as seen on TikTok). Lifted? Undoubtedly. But I also look like an entirely different ethnicity. The other (more old-school) way is to lift the face with beauty tape applied in the hairline near the eyes. Once my hair is around my face, the tape isn’t visible, and gives the “snatched” effect that Bella Hadid reportedly favours. The verdictA hard no. It’s super uncomfortable. And each time I let my face return to its usual resting position, it felt lacking in a way I didn’t feel before. It’s similar to the way we feel seeing filtered images of ourselves.

5/20/2022,"In March 2021, I was driven by a stranger down to the Essex coast, and there I found myself at the end of the 19th century, in a place that had never existed, full of people who’d never been born. At any rate, that was the impression; in fact, I’d been deposited in a field on Mersea Island, which is cut off from the Essex mainland by a causeway inaccessible at high tide. Filming was under way for an adaptation of my novel The Essex Serpent, and since Mersea was one of the locations making do for Aldwinter, the imagined village where the novel is set, I’d been invited to take a look. The field had been colonised by a series of trucks and trailers, and everywhere I looked crew members were dashing about with clipboards and headsets, occasionally interspersed with actors in top hats, or in petticoats inches deep in Essex mud. I know Mersea well, and had last visited with my goddaughter, so as I walked about there was the strangest sensation of double familiarity. On the one hand, there were the same old wooden cottages, and the same sea wall with shingle below it, and the cafe where we often bought ice-cream – but overlaying it all was Aldwinter, familiar to me only because I’d invented it. Down on the quay, a fire hose was doing the work of high tide, and seaweed had been scattered about; concrete bollards had been concealed by wooden crates, and fishing nets were hung over garden walls to dry. Everywhere there was an atmosphere of diligent hard work, as crew members adjusted baskets for eels, or children wandered past in shawls and clogs, but there was also the eerie atmosphere peculiar to that part of the Essex coast. It was Aldwinter to the letter, and astoundingly uncanny: it was as if the acts of writing and reading had been bypassed entirely, and the whole thing had leapt clean out of my skull. As I arrived, filming had begun on a scene in which Aldwinter’s vicar Will Ransome (played – perfectly, in my disinterested opinion – by Tom Hiddleston) is briefly seen remonstrating with his sanctimonious verger outside the village school. The director Clio Barnard and the screenwriter Anna Symon welcomed me with characteristic kindness and I was given a headset, and shown the action on an iPad. Over and over, without once appearing to grow weary or impatient, the actors worked diligently at the brief scene until it was right, and the sight of this moved me almost to tears. That the story I’d written in a small, cold room in a Norwich terrace would one day be accorded such extraordinary care by so many people was remarkable, and I went to sit on the quay with a solitary cigarette, looking at the Thames barges moored nearby, trying to accommodate it all. I suppose it would be usual for a writer to daydream about this sort of thing, but I never did: I’d allowed myself only the hope of kind reviews, and the means to pay the council tax on time. So the year of publication had constituted a series of wonderful shocks, one of which was finding myself in the offices of See-Saw Films, the production company that optioned the novel. Largely I remember an immense bearded lurcher taking up a sofa in the corner, and a sensation – quite rare to me – of deep shyness. I was treated by the prospective producers with great care. Was there anything in particular I felt should be done with the novel? There was, I said, screwing my courage to the sticking place: keep it gothic, and keep the women real. To the lasting confusion of a number of readers, the novel depicted women as they were in the 1890s – not fainting away in violet-scented swoons and never allowed beyond the withdrawing room without a chaperone, but vital, intelligent, lively and well-educated people, involved in politics, social justice and the sciences, and I felt if that was lost, the betrayal would be far worse than an injustice against fiction. They gave me their word, and I left the meeting assured the book was in the right hands, and promptly forgot all about it. I forgot partly as an act of will. I’d been cautioned to expect agonising delays: there was casting to be seen to, of course, and all sorts of machinations regarding funding and distribution. Now and then I’d be given good news, and occasionally bad; but already I was coming to the end of my third novel, and was conscious of the dangers of dwelling on a moment of professional success, and never moving beyond it. I’d done my work, and handed it over: I didn’t feel it was any of my business. Besides, I’d seen Clio’s vision, and read Anna’s scripts, and it seemed to me then – and it certainly seems to me now – that in fact they’d amplify the novel as they altered it, so that the TV series and the book would be happy companions, neither cancelling the other out. Still: it was extremely difficult to maintain such a stern grip on myself when Claire Danes and Tom Hiddleston were cast, and I’m afraid on one occasion I forgot myself so far as to lie face down on the carpet in a state of elated shock. Often I’m asked if the lead actors resemble the characters as I’d imagined them. The truth is that I give less thought to the looks of my characters than to their interior lives: as I write, I’m not looking at them, I am inhabiting them. Claire Danes, who takes the lead role of Cora Seaborne and is a slight woman of extraordinary poise, doesn’t exactly resemble Cora, who is described as tall and broad-hipped and untidy. It doesn’t matter: the moment she came striding through Aldwinter on a sunny March morning, I saw only my Cora – a woman of warmth and vitality and intellect, hardly able to contain her lust for the world, and nothing like as wise as she thinks she is. Now and then, the experience has proved melancholy. The novel was published six years ago, and sometimes I’ve melodramatically said that the woman who wrote it is dead. I was 35 when I wrote the final pages: much is changed and lost since then. The series, like the novel, is optimistic and even radical in its treatment of intimacy, affection and wonder, and I suspect I’ve grown a little harder and more cynical in the years that followed. Returning to the novel – on one occasion in corsets and teal-blue Victorian gown as an extra at the Natural History Museum – has been like passing my past self on the stairs, always with a pang of affection and loss. But earlier this spring, as I was shown the series in a tiny Soho cinema, there was only pleasure and delight. All I could do was thank the director, and the writer, and everyone within earshot – because it isn’t pride I feel, it’s gratitude. There had been a time during the pandemic when I’d come to feel that the pursuit of literature was more or less worthless, and that I ought to have devoted myself to medicine, perhaps, or the law. To witness the years of diligence and skill the production entailed returned the courage I’d lost: suddenly the act of storytelling was restored to something noble, and worth the full attention of my life. “What will survive of us,” said Philip Larkin, albeit grudgingly, “is love.” Well: The Essex Serpent is a book about love, that was written with love, and now has been treated with love. I might allow myself to hope it’s what survives of me.  Sarah Perry will discuss The Essex Serpent and answer your questions at a Guardian Live online event on Wednesday 8 June. Book tickets here.

5/20/2022,"Digital marketing group Next Fifteen has struck a £310m deal to buy M&C Saatchi, gazumping tech entrepreneur Vin Murria’s attempt to buy the ad agency. London-listed Next Fifteen, which has a £1.2bn market valuation, has tabled a cash and share offer for M&C Saatchi that it aims to seal through a scheme of arrangement. The use of the court-approved tactic, which requires Next Fifteen to get approval from 75% of shareholders, forces any investors against the deal to sell once the threshold is met. M&C Saatchi’s independent directors, who have rejected four offers from Vin Murria’s investment vehicle AdvancedAdvT (ADV) since January, have unanimously recommended the offer to shareholders. “The M&C Saatchi independent directors are pleased to unanimously recommend this alternative, more attractive offer which we are confident is in the best interests of M&C Saatchi shareholders and M&C Saatchi’s other key stakeholders,” said Gareth Davis, chairman of the agency group. “The M&C Saatchi independent directors all consider Next Fifteen’s offer to be far superior to the offer announced earlier this week by ADV, and a clear repudiation of ADV’s response statement that it strongly disagreed its bid undervalued M&C Saatchi.” The company board called Murria’s latest offer, which valued the business at £254m, “derisory” and said there was a “total lack of support” from its 18-strong executive team, which feared a talent and client exodus. Murria is deputy chair of M&C Saatchi and its biggest single shareholder, and ADV control 22% of the agency. Earlier this week she said that her latest offer had support from a further 21% of M&C Saatchi shareholders, although she had only secured irrevocable undertakings committing to it from a few per cent. “This is an exciting opportunity to bring together two highly complementary businesses creating a truly global and diversified group with exceptional capabilities, clients and talent,” said Tim Dyson, chief executive of Next Fifteen. “M&C Saatchi is synonymous with creativity and strategy, whereas Next Fifteen has built a reputation around its technology and data-driven offering. This makes for a great combination, and we are confident we can accelerate the ambitions of both businesses, creating significant value for our clients, our people and our shareholders.” ",News/Media,M&C Saatchi accepts £310m takeover by Next Fifteen,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/20/m-and-c-saatchi-accepts-takeover-by-next-fifteen-rejects-vin-murria-adv
5/20/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, have maintained a cracking pace on the final day of the election campaign. Guardian Australia’s Paul Karp and Josh Butler were with the leaders on Friday as they raced towards Saturday’s finish line. Morrison’s campaign has come full circle. It started as a case of “better the devil you know”, then took a diversion in the penultimate week when he introduced his vague bulldozer analogy to suggest he can change. In the final week Morrison has said bulldozers can help “get things done” and all he will do is change gear. By the final day it became clear the wheels have fallen off the now entirely incoherent analogy, and it’s continuity, not change, Morrison is offering once again. Friday started with a round of morning interviews, in which Morrison’s view that the economy means unemployment and government debt was challenged by those who know that for many people it actually means prices and real wage cuts. He struggled to get TV and radio interviews all around the country back onto the opposition’s costings and the Coalition’s super release policy. The first stop was a community breakfast at Karawara in Swan (Perth), a Liberal-held seat that is tipped to fall to Labor’s Zaneta Mascarenhas, where Kristy McSweeney is vying to replace the retiring MP Steve Irons. Journalists were promised friendly local families which, in reality, means friendly to the prime minister because attendees are carefully selected, mainly Liberal members. Morrison talked up the need for a good local representative, stumbling over the candidate’s name by referring to her once as Kirsty. With recourse to his notes, he got the name right, then peppered his speech with corrected references to Kristy. Everyone is tired. Mistakes happen. Since joining the bus I’ve realised that so much of the perception that, unlike Albanese, Morrison knows the stats and answers questions transparently is just down to his slicker presentation style and preparation by his staff: the figures printed on a page, a shorter escape route, shouts of “thanks media” to obscure he is leaving with questions unanswered. At the Jindalee housing estate in Pearce, Morrison followed his usual pattern of meeting a few happy new homeowners, who received homebuilder grants of $25,000 in the pandemic and thought accessing superannuation was also a great idea. The only renters you’re likely to meet on the Morrison bus are those waiting for their new build to finish. After inspecting the floor plans, Morrison fronted the media one last time to intone attack lines about Labor’s handling of the economy and the choice facing Australians. Asked if he could show empathy to the Murugappan family and allow them to return to Biloela, Morrison said giving visas out was like writing “a prospectus for people smugglers” and that electing Labor would see “all of that terror come back” (despite there being barely a cigarette paper’s difference between Labor and the Coalition’s policy). Morrison was also pressed by Guardian Australia about how Australians can trust his last-minute conversion, given the shifting bulldozer analogy, and what of substance he had actually changed. Morrison responded that he disagreed with the “assertion” and “argument” he said was contained in the question, and bulldozed on, this time with a smile and a jibe that I, the reporter, was “sounding like a bit of a bulldozer” myself. At the Wanneroo rugby union club, Morrison announced a $4m grant, noting with fondness that he had grown up around a similar club. That would be before his conversion to league and supporting the Cronulla Sharks, a shapeshift that proved a little more lasting. Serving some journos and his own staff at the sausage sizzle of the club’s barbecue lunch, Morrison extended an olive branch to this correspondent: “There’s veggie ones here too, Paul.” Next we arrived at the Sikh Gurdwara Perth, a temple in Hasluck near the border with Cowan, Morrison again mixing offence against Labor’s Anne Aly with a bid to shore up the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, who has held Hasluck since 2010, with a further stop in a manufacturing business in Cowan to come. Morrison’s final day involved five stops in four electorates. It was a whirlwind of activity as the election rushed to its conclusion. Morrison is nothing if not vigorous as he keeps the plates spinning in so many different parts of the country – but whether he’s spun out of trouble again or spun off course, we will not know until election night. Albanese promised a “final sprint” in the last days. Friday, the last full day of the election, lived up to the hype as the usually moderate pace of the Labor leader’s campaign was as supercharged as the three coffees he said he’d gulped before 9am. In a three-state blitz of marginal seats on the final day of the campaign, Albanese hit Boothby, Sturt and Bass, ahead of a swing through Victoria on Friday night. He brought local firepower in the former PM Julia Gillard, who appealed directly to the women of Australia in saying an Albanese government would be one that “cares about, values and includes women”. A quiet cafe descended into a bit of chaos as the national media pack and half a dozen politicians crammed in for a photo op, along with a group of Liberal volunteers brandishing “won’t be easy under Albanese” signs. The campaigners, wearing shirts for the Liberal MP James Stevens, were quickly shooed out by the owner. Locals told journalists that Sturt was a longtime Liberal area, but claimed there was a “mood for change” on the ground. Other cafe regulars asked “what’s going on here?” as they entered to see a dozen flashing cameras. Labor heavyweights Penny Wong, Mark Butler and Don Randall chatted, as a wall-mounted TV behind them played Channel Seven’s morning show, coincidentally featuring Christopher Pyne – the former Liberal MP for Sturt – in a segment on the most notable gaffes of the election campaign. Albanese sipped a piccolo, Gillard a long black. A local married couple peered curiously through the window at the packed cafe, saying they wanted “fewer words, more action” from politicians., as they were “despairing the state of the world”. Asked if she had any tips for Albanese’s final day on the trail, Gillard said “he doesn’t need my advice” and that he was “campaigning magnificently”. Then off to a school in Boothby with new South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, the trio of senior Labor politicians getting absolutely mobbed by kids for selfies at recess time. Gillard was a hit with many young women, who flocked for photos and quick conversations. Albanese waved and smiled, while Malinauskas shook hands and tossed a footy with some of the older boys. But not everyone was exactly up-to-date with who they were flocking to get photos of. “He’s the guy running against ScoMo,” one young girl told her friend. “Is he the guy in the glasses?” one queried back. “What’s he doing here? None of us can vote,” noted one boy. A press conference in the school’s courtyard saw Albanese in a contemplative mood, fielding questions on what he’d learned in the campaign, what it means to him, and saying his late, beloved mother Maryanne would be “proud as punch” of her son, standing on the cusp of victory. “During this campaign, I’ve been positive. I’ve been who I am. I don’t pretend to be perfect,” he said. Guardian Australia asked what he learned from his own mistakes in the campaign. He replied: “Own it.” On to a plane across the Tasman, skipping to the ultra-marginal Liberal seat of Bass to encourage volunteers at a pre-poll. At the biggest booth in Launceston, the Labor candidate, Ross Hart, and the sitting Coalition MP, Bridget Archer, stood handing out how-to-vote cards. Albanese swept in, shaking hands and taking selfies with supporters. Archer said she guessed Albanese would be in town, judging from the large crowd of red-shirted Labor types who arrived shortly before. “Most work they’ve done in two weeks,” she joked. “Once they start bussing the unions in, you know it’s on.” The booth, next to a giant Pet Barn, saw early voters streaming in and out. Few ordinary folks seemed to notice, or care, about the arrival of the Labor leader. A man in tradie high vis told us he didn’t even vote, just walked in and got his name ticked off. “I’m not about politics, they’re all the same. No point,” he said. An older woman, Estelle, said she voted Greens – but wanted Albanese to win. “Bloody oath, I don’t know what I’d do if the other guy won,” she said. In and out of Tasmania in 90 minutes, after a seven-minute visit to the pre-poll, the Albanese campaign was back in the air and gone. Destination: Melbourne. On the last night of the campaign, the Labor leader will appear on the ABC’s 7.30 program – after making a virtue of fronting up for media interviews the PM wouldn’t. Earlier in the day, Labor launched its “final day pitch” video on social media, featuring Albanese walking through his childhood suburb of Camperdown, in Sydney’s inner west. “We can do so much better,” Albanese says, in a black T-shirt and his skinny grey chinos. Spliced with staged footage and clips from the election trail – including packed campaign rallies and cuddling babies – Albanese presents the election choice as “three more years of the same or unlocking the potential of this great country”. “Our best days are ahead of us,” he said. It’s now up to the voters to decide whether Albanese’s best days are ahead of him.",News/Australia news,Final dash: Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese’s last day on the campaign trail,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/final-dash-scott-morrison-and-anthony-albaneses-last-day-on-the-campaign-trail
