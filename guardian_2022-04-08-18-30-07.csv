4/8/2022,"With many schools breaking up at the start of the month, the Easter getaway was supposed to be well under way by now – but instead it’s been a week of travel chaos. Airlines have cancelled scores of flights a day, there have been delays at at airports and ferry terminals and Covid cases are sweeping the country. We look at your rights if you find yourself seriously delayed or unable to travel. Airlines have cancelled more than 1,000 UK flights in recent days because of high levels of crew absences in part related to Covid infections, but also because they have not rehired enough staff since lockdowns eased. If your flight was cancelled in the two weeks before its departure date and you have chosen to abandon the whole trip rather than find another way to get to your destination, you are entitled to a full refund of the fare you paid, plus compensation. EU regulation 261/2004 compensation rules have been written into UK law, meaning you have exactly the same rights to claim flight compensation as you did before Brexit. If your flight was short-haul – less than 1,500km – you are entitled to compensation of £220 a passenger. For middle-distance flights of 1,500 to 3,500km the figure rises to £350 and for a long-haul destination more than 3,500 km away it is £520. If a flight is cancelled before you are due to depart, irrespective of the reason, you have the right to ask to be rerouted on an alternative flight, either with the same airline or another one. In some cases the airline will offer this – BA told us this week it had been doing so – but it may not always be the case. If an airline cancels your flight at the last minute and you are forced to buy a new flight with a rival carrier, you can claim the cost of the replacement flight. If your original flight was more expensive, however, you’d be better off requesting a full refund. Be aware that airlines often refuse these requests or to cover things such as onward travel by another form of transport to your original destination, but you are entitled to the money. If you are rerouted by your original airline and the replacement flight arrives more than two hours late, you are entitled to £220 compensation a passenger for flights of up to 1,500km. If flights are cancelled because of extreme weather or an air traffic control strike, for example, the EU 261 compensation rules no longer apply. This does not, however, extend to staff absences, according to Coby Benson, a flight compensation expert at the law firm Bott & Co. He says airlines have tried to argue in a number of court cases that staff illness was an extraordinary circumstance and that they should be exempt from having to pay compensation, but they have been rebuffed each time. The overwhelming majority of affected flights this week have been cancelled by just two operators, British Airways and easyJet, suggesting this is not an industry-wide problem. No, but you are entitled to a full refund or a replacement flight. It’s highly unlikely. It might seem very unfair given that the airport has been in chaos all week, but Benson says he is not aware of any possible legal basis that would allow passengers to pursue the airport operator for their losses. The better – ie. the more expensive – policies often include cover for missed departures. The exact circumstances vary, but they will generally protect you in the event you miss the departure of your international flight, ferry, cruise ship or train because of a strike or other public transport disruption. It is unclear, however, if they would cover the incidents such as this week’s airport chaos. Policies usually provide missed departure cover if there is an accident involving the vehicle you are travelling in or it breaks down, but not general traffic delays. A large number of P&O Ferries customers face having their Easter holidays ruined after fully booked DFDS announced it would no longer honour P&O tickets from Dover to France. DFDS had been accepting P&O passengers since its rival suspended its Dover-Calais crossings on 17 March and sacked nearly 800 members of staff so it could hire cheaper agency workers. The mutual agreement was paused on 8 April because of a lack of capacity, leaving ticket-holders having to rebook with DFDS themselves or Eurotunnel. P&O Ferries has said it hopes to get its ships back in action next week. P&O passengers unable to travel this weekend are entitled to a full refund, but unlike air passengers they are not entitled to compensation or rerouting. Stena announced earlier this week that it was cancelling all ferry services between Fishguard in south Wales and Rosslare until 12 April. Ticket-holders have been told that they can travel on Irish Ferries services from Pembroke docks instead. This will not present too many problems for drivers, but foot passengers and cyclists face having to make the 27-mile journey themselves. Stena staff told Guardian Money this week that no alternative transport had been laid on, but that passengers not travelling in vehicles could ask for a full refund if they didn’t wish to travel. The advice from most experts is that you should not travel if you are displaying Covid symptoms. Few would argue that is morally the correct stance. The government’s guidance for England published on 1 April states that if you have tested positive for Covid, you should “try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days”. It doesn’t say you can’t travel. Rather it says that if you leave your home during this time, there are steps you can take to reduce the chances of passing it on to others, including wearing a mask. How far you are likely to get if you try to travel with Covid will depend on where you are going and, perhaps, whether you are visibly ill. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, says: “While the government advises that people do not have to self-isolate when they have Covid, some airlines and ferry operators will ask you not to travel with them. “Most travellers we hear from who have symptoms of Covid take a test beforehand and, if they are positive, decide that isolating at home is the responsible thing to do.” He also says flexible booking policies and travel insurance “will continue to be essential to ensure passengers aren’t left out of pocket if they get Covid and can’t travel”. If you do decide to carry on with your plans, you may be able to catch a flight or ferry, but you could be turned away if you are clearly under the weather. Stena Line, for example, states: “When checking in, you will be asked to state your health condition. Passengers with any indication of suspected Covid-19 will be denied boarding.” According to easyJet, for some journeys at some airports there may be a temperature check carried out at departure and/or arrival, depending on destination requirements.“Where there are temperature checks, if you do not pass, you will not be able to fly,” it says. Those heading to the popular Easter destination of Morocco still have to present a valid vaccine pass and proof of a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours of boarding. It is also conducting random rapid antigen tests on arrival for selected groups of passengers. In terms of coming back to the UK, since 18 March, anyone entering the country no longer needs to take a Covid test or fill in a passenger locator form, whether they are vaccinated or not. The government has removed the last Covid restrictions in England and a growing number of other countries are easing their rules, but many still have requirements for people arriving from overseas. France dropped its requirement for a sworn statement that you have not had any Covid symptoms recently on 31 March. Fully vaccinated travellers only need to present proof of vaccination, though those flying into the country are required to fill in an EU passenger locator form. Most adults travelling to Spain can enter without needing to do a test. You must, however, show valid proof of being fully vaccinated and fill in a Spanish “health control form” before you travel. The rules are different for children and teenagers. Unvaccinated youngsters aged 12 to 17 can provide a negative PCR or similar test taken within 72 hours prior to arrival. Spain is one of the countries that says it may do temperature checks on arrival and carry out additional tests if there are concerns. Fully vaccinated foreign travellers entering Canada “by land, air or water” are longer required to do pre-entry tests as of April 1. You still have to submit your travel and vaccination details via the ArriveCAN website or app though, and on arrival border services staff may stop you and say you’ve been randomly selected for a mandatory Covid test. It’s a fast-moving situation, and not every country making changes is easing its requirements. Which? recently published a guide to “16 test-free travel destinations for a no-hassle holiday,” including Mexico and Iceland. If you are going on a cruise, be aware that many operators have quite strict rules at the moment. P&O Cruises, Cunard and Saga are among those that currently require you to do a Covid test at the terminal before you board. In the case of Saga it’s two tests. As you might expect, if you test positive, you won’t be getting on board. P&O Cruises and Cunard say that if that happens, you and any guests travelling from your household will be given a “future cruise credit” to the value of your holiday. Saga says that your cruise will be postponed until a later date. There are other rules too. Cunard stipulates that if you or a member of your household tests positive for Covid within 14 days of your holiday, you won’t be allowed to travel. Saga says you will be denied boarding if you have returned to the UK from an overseas trip in the seven days before your cruise. It all depends on what cover you were offered when you bought the policy. Most travel insurers will cover any medical bills if you catch Covid while abroad. Some will pay for the extra accommodation and new flights required for a delayed return, but plenty will not. It really is a case of digging out your policy documents. Staysure’s enhanced and generous Covid cancellation cover, for example, only applies to policies bought after 29 April 2021, and only as long as the customer has had their recommended vaccinations. It will cover the cost of cancelling because one or all the party goes down with the virus. Plenty of other policies won’t, particularly those bought some time ago.

4/8/2022,"It was a spring morning when Elise Rustad saw the creature loping down a Toronto sidewalk. At a distance, it looked like a dog, but no owner was nearby. As it drew closer, she was struck by its size and its thick black, white and grey coat. “It was big. I’ve seen a wolf before,” she said. “And that really looked like a wolf.” After watching the video she had recorded, her husband suspected it could be something else. He and others in Canada’s largest city have grown convinced that a large, elusive predator has taken up residence in Toronto’s wild ravine system. Part coyote and part wolf, the urban “coy-wolf” is said to stalk house pets and humans. Media reports have fed into the lore, both heralding their arrival to Ontario cities and implicating them in attacks and the recent killing of a family dog. Big for a coyote. One of those coywolves I’ve been hearing about? pic.twitter.com/GQwg1RwuyX Experts insist that no such creature exists, likening eyewitness accounts to sightings of werewolves and chupacabra, but recent genetic evidence shows wolf-like animals are in Toronto – and have been living in plain sight alongside human residents for decades. For the most part, humans coexist peacefully in the city with coyotes, the largest predator in North America to establish a thriving population in the valleys between skyscrapers. Coyotes are the quiet neighbour, slipping through the urban forest like ghosts as they scavenge through garbage, hunt small rodents or feast on birdseed. Coyote encounters across Toronto are common and have increased dramatically throughout the pandemic, as more residents venture into the ribbons of woodlands that thread the city. In recent years, the idea of the coy-wolf has emerged to describe coyotes that seemed particularly large or threatening. “We get reports all the time of people saying they saw a coyote, but it was so big it must have been a coy-wolf. Or it was behaving a certain way, so it must have been a coy-wolf,” said Lesley Sampson, executive director of Coyote Watch Canada. “But the reality is, they’re just seeing eastern coyotes.” Rustad’s video, says Sampson, is “most definitely” a coyote. “He’s actually a fairly well-known elder in the city.” Part of the problem stems from the wide range of appearances in the eastern coyote – the species found throughout Toronto and its forests for nearly a century. “Some definitely look more wolf-like than others,” she said. “If the public saw all the photos of eastern coyotes that have been cataloged over the years, they’d likely pick out a number of them as being wolves.” Ecologists suspect confusion over appearance has led to media reports on the encroachment of a new species into city parks. “People often think that coyotes are cunning and mischievous. And they often think of wolves as aggressive hunters that are bigger and stronger,” said Sara Bowman, an environmental educator in Toronto. “And so when they’re saying ‘coy-wolf’, they’re conjuring the idea of a mega-killer on our streets. And that’s just not accurate.” But biologists say the term coy-wolf, while it doesn’t accurately describe a new animal in the city, nonetheless captures the tangled history of Toronto’s coyote population that has, until recently, been poorly understood. Despite their commonplace appearance, eastern coyotes are relatively new, the result of breeding between western coyotes and eastern wolves. The hybrids first emerged in the 1920s in southern Algonquin park, Canada’s oldest provincial park, and quickly colonized much of southern Ontario and the north-eastern United States, where wolves had been extirpated. They thrived in urban centres like Toronto, a chaotic habitat that rewards shrewd and opportunistic wildlife. Jonathan Way, a biologist in Massachusetts who has studied eastern coyotes for decades, agrees that media reports and citizen sightings of a hulking, shadowy predator are fiction. But he says recent testing has shown that in some regions, as much as 35% of the eastern coyote’s DNA is wolf. Many also have a small percentage of dog DNA. “How are we calling this animal a coyote? It’s not a coyote. It’s not a wolf. It’s a hybrid,” said Way. “In one word, coy-wolf accurately describes the animal.” Way believes using the term coy-wolf not only recognizes the lineage of the canids, but could lend more protections to the animals, which carry the DNA of threatened eastern wolves, in the north-eastern United States, where they are actively hunted with no limits. “Calling them coy-wolves … does not make them more dangerous. It’s still the animal that has always been here. We just have modern, genetic data to show what this animal actually is.” Because eastern coyotes and coy-wolves are the same, Toronto is teeming with wolf-like hybrids. But the lore of a fearsome creature takes away from the mystique and grandeur of animals living in their midst, says Sampson. “We don’t need to create some mythical creature that lives in the wilds of our minds,” she said. “Folks should just be appreciative that this amazing creature, the eastern coyote, is so capable of thriving among us.”",News/Environment,Toronto’s mystery predator really is a coy-wolf – but not as we know it,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/08/coy-wolf-hybrid-toronto-canada-aoe
4/8/2022,"Larry Allen has worked in various jobs at Dallas Fort Worth international airport for over 40 years. Before the pandemic, Allen worked as a baggage handler, making just over $2 an hour and relying on tips to get by. When Covid-19 hit the US, Allen was told not to come back into work and wasn’t recalled until one year later, when he took a position as a wheelchair agent. He now makes only $8 an hour, plus tips, but those tips aren’t guaranteed and can vary widely and he relies on social security benefits and Medicare. In his late 60s, Allen walks a few miles every day at work, and at his age worries about the physical toll working in the airport has taken on his body and his ability to eventually retire comfortably. He is pushing to organize a union among his co-workers at the airport to improve wages, benefits and working conditions. “We need more money and more respect for the work we do. Eight dollars an hour is just not enough,” said Allen. “A union is an advantage, to get proper wage and insurance so if you get sick, you’ll have some medical coverage, and if something happens, you’ll have somebody to represent you and back you up.” Allen is one of many airport workers around the US who took part in protest actions last month to pressure government officials at local, state and federal levels, and the CEOs of large airlines, including United, Delta and American Airlines, to sign on to a Good Airports pledge, committing to ensuring airport workers are paid living wages, provided affordable healthcare and have the right to organize a union. The actions were part of a campaign led by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) for airport workers to bargain through a union for improved pay, working conditions, healthcare and sick leave. Contracted workers, including baggage handlers, cabin cleaners, security guards, wheelchair attendants and janitorial staff participated in actions at United Airlines and American Airlines headquarters and airports in Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, New York City, Miami, Houston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Minneapolis, Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, Washington DC, Portland, Newark, Chicago. and Denver. New union organizing efforts were launched in Phoenix, Dallas and Charlotte. “I’m only paid $12 an hour. I work a lot of hours and some days I work so late that I just sleep over at the airport. I can’t afford a car, rent and to send money home to my family in Sudan,” said Omer Hussein, a wheelchair attendant servicing American Airlines at Dallas Fort Worth international airport, in a press release on the actions. “I like working with passengers, but I’m so tired all the time. That won’t fly any longer.” Airline contractors have reported difficulties in staffing positions as air travel demand has continued to improve toward pre-pandemic levels. Airline corporations have increasingly outsourced work to contractors in recent decades, which often pay workers low wages with few or no benefits. The SEIU cited data on the demographics of contracted airport workers in the US, revealing that 64% are people of color and are paid 42% less on average than their white peers in the air transportation industry. Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU, said workers were speaking up to hold airlines accountable because they are paid from the profits of these companies through contractors. She characterized the actions as part of a historic uprising of workers around the US demanding a voice on the job through a union and to be respected, protected and paid what they are worth. “They’re speaking up to say they’re fed up with business as usual, because why should a worker in Chicago who drops a passenger off in a wheelchair get paid $18 an hour while the worker in Dallas who picks them up upon arrival gets paid only $8 an hour? Where your firm or the job you do are should not determine whether you support your family and can take care of yourself when you’re sick or have a voice on the job,” said Henry. “The major airlines can change the system of these jobs that used to be middle-class jobs with benefits that people could raise their families on.”",News/US news,Airport workers ramp up pressure for a living wage and union rights,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/airport-workers-union-wages-conditions
4/8/2022,"This week, remarkable images were released of harp seals scattered across a fragmented and rapidly disintegrating ice sheet east of Greenland. With record high temperatures and early melting in the Arctic, great cracks create a deadly mosaic on the sheet, an icy crazy paving on which you can make out dark specks – each one a seal, peering out as if bemused by its fate. In such an inhospitable environment, viewed from such height, the marine mammals resemble alien life forms glimpsed on another planet. By 2035, it is estimated that the disappearance of Arctic sea ice will mean that around 7.5 million harp seals will lose their home. It is another cruel turn for animals that in the 20th century were extensively hunted for their fur – especially the flawless white pelts of their pups. They depend on the sea ice: it is the arena in which they rest after hunting for food, mate, and give birth. The ice is the centre of their lives. Now an extraordinary surveying technique pioneered by scientists from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Wageningen Marine Research offers a slender hope for the seals’ future. Using satellite technology, superhigh resolution images are being produced in which each pixel measures 30x30cm. This allows for the individual identification of harp seals – despite the fact that the satellite is flying 400 miles over their heads. By working in conjunction with a large-scale Norwegian aerial and ship-based survey using helicopters, drones and an aeroplane, an accurate count of these enigmatic animals may be possible for the first time. It is a measure of the climate emergency that we humans have to go so far above the Earth to determine the future prospects of the species with whom we share the planet. “The effects of climate change are most notable in the remote and inaccessible polar regions, out of sight for most of us,” Jeroen Hoekendijk of the Royal Netherlands Institute told me. “These new technologies provide a valuable tool to monitor Arctic seal populations and study the effects of the rapidly disappearing sea ice.” But is it too late? Human technology has ever accelerated, with disregard for its impact on the natural world. It is strange how we sometimes have to see things from far away to realise their fragility or assess their beauty. The space race of the 1960s and 70s – which sometimes seemed like a race to leave an environmentally and nuclear-threatened Earth – had that effect. Courtesy of the Apollo moonshots, we knew what our planet looked like from outer space before we knew what whales looked like underwater. Even now, more humans have set foot on the moon than have reached the deepest part of the world’s oceans. Vastness can still defeat us. “The sea, everywhere the sea,” as the Haitian-Canadian writer Dany Laferrière has said, “and no one looking at it.” We have moved a long way from Victorian surveyors prizing themselves on taking aerial photographs of imperial edifices by sending cameras attached to hot air balloons with cable-release shutters – even as hunters were roaming icy wastes killing seals to provide fur collars and coats. In 1880, a young Arthur Conan Doyle, then a medical student, enlisted in an Arctic hunt for seals and whales, but having witnessed its brutality – 800 seals were killed in one day – he quickly came to regret his part in the “murderous harvest”. “Amid all the excitement,” Conan Doyle confessed in his private journal, “one’s sympathies lie with the poor hunted creatures.” Nor was 20th-century technology good news for marine mammals. In the late 1940s British whaling fleets employed Supermarine Walrus amphibious military reconnaissance biplanes – made by the same Southampton company that produced the Spitfire – to search for pods of whales for hunters to harpoon. Tactlessly, they even named one of the planes Moby Dick. “It is the gunner’s business always to pick the largest animal, which calls for considerable experience,” noted one of the team, eyeing up their target. The aerial hunters were assisted in their deadly photographic survey by their chief scientist from Cambridge. Now we rely on our ever more stratospheric equipment to make amends, and the modern university of Cambridge’s British Antarctic Survey team are detecting walruses from space with a view to conserve rather than kill them. It’s a remarkable trajectory. Now drone technology gives us the eyes of gods, in war and peace. It offers us a seemingly immortal, omniscient view, as if the whole of the world were under our control. Our planet seems reduced to a video game. Does it take this image of seals scattered in an almost abstract pattern on fractured ice to make us realise what we may have already lost? Or does this seal census signal a glimmer of hope, as seen through an extraterrestrial lens?

4/8/2022,"The US’s largest federation of labor unions is leading a coalition demanding Fifa address concerns around human and labor rights at the 2026 World Cup in US, Canada and Mexico and commit to minimum standards on these issues. The 2022 World Cup in Qatar to be held later this year has already been marred in egregious human rights and labor violations, including the deaths of thousands of migrant workers who were brought into the country to build stadiums and infrastructure for the event, evidence of forced labor, reports of withheld wages, exorbitant recruitment fees charged to workers, and paltry pay. In December 2021, the AFL-CIO, a federation of 57 labor unions in the US, and several other labor and human rights groups, wrote a letter to Fifa demanding minimum labor standards for planning and execution of the 2026 World Cup and that Fifa meet with the groups to address commitments Fifa should make to meet human rights guarantees. “Without such guarantees, Fifa essentially stands to profit from low wages, unsafe working conditions, racial discrimination in hiring and promotion, gentrification, and other forms of skewed development that make low-income communities dread the arrival of a mega-sporting event,” the letter wrote. Fifa wrote back in January 2022, dismissing concerns about the governing body’s human rights policies and implementation of them. “It was really just a superficial response. There were no initial commitments, no serious commitment to engaging us,” said Cathy Feingold, Director of the International Department at the AFL-CIO. Feingold explained now is the time multi-million dollar deals are made ahead of the 2026 World Cup, in terms of major tax breaks and contract bids, and the coalition is pushing for minimum labor standards to be included in these deals, such as local hiring and diversity hiring directives, use of unionized labor discrimination protections for workers, healthcare access while workers are working events, and minimum wage standards for the event that generates billions of dollars in revenue and profits. In their response, the AFL-CIO and other groups set a deadline of 15 March 2022 for Fifa to schedule a meeting with the groups to discuss the issues before host cities for the 2026 World Cup are selected. Fifa never responded until shortly after they were asked to comment on this story on 31 March. The AFL-CIO led coalition characterized the response as offering the bare minimum and avoiding the coalition’s demands in regards to ensuring high level Fifa officials with the authority to implement labor and human rights standards attend and the issues to be discussed. “The real issue here is to ensure that when Fifa comes to town, and we’re still waiting to hear what cities in the US will host workers will have a voice in the agreement, workers will be part of the conversation about what happens with those games,” Feingold added. “Now is the time when these key pieces get put in place, usually the time when people aren’t paying attention because it is so far out. But this is when the deals get locked in. This is when the resource decisions get made. We need workers at the table. We need community partners there with us so that these games can actually be a different model.” In Orlando, Florida, one of 17 US cities that submitted bids to host games for the 2026 World Cup, Eric Clinton, President of UNITE HERE Local 362, a labor union which represents Disney workers and food service workers around the Orlando area, criticized the lack of input or inclusion of local labor unions in the city’s bid. “Not only did the Orlando committee say that they did include us, they insulted us and said that labor unions in Central Florida are not relevant, which is just simply not true. we represent 70,000 people here,” Clinton told the Guardian. He noted at the behest of Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer, the committee finally met with local labor leaders, but after the bid was submitted. “It’s too little too late,” Clinton said. “It’s an honor to be awarded the game and it would be an economic study stimulus, it causes a lot of money to come into the community. But the question I have, on behalf of my members, is who is benefiting from it? Is it workers who will be cleaning the stands and restrooms in the stadiums, making sure places are secure and safe, or running audio and visual? Or is it Fifa and their cronies who have done a disservice to working people by leaving them on the sidelines?” A spokesperson for Fifa argued the host city selection process has a human rights component designed to ensure candidate host cities engage with local stakeholders. “In line with its Statutes and Human Rights Policy, Fifa remains steadfast in its commitment to protect and promote human rights across football, and to use the popularity of the sport to help foster still wider positive social change around the world,” said the spokesperson in an email. “We are confident that the selection process and the city plans will provide a robust foundation for the collaboration between the host city teams and relevant rights-holder groups in the preparation and hosting of the Fifa World Cup in 2026. Fifa has been in contact with AFL-CIO during the process and the independent evaluators of the candidate host city reports take into account the written feedback shared by AFL-CIO and others. Furthermore, Fifa is in touch with AFL-CIO and other national level stakeholders to schedule further exchanges in the coming weeks.”",Sport/Football,Largest US union federation presses Fifa on labor rights around 2026 World Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/afl-cio-labor-union-demands-2026-world-cup
4/8/2022,"The high court has cleared the decks for Scott Morrison to call the federal election by refusing to hear a last-ditch appeal against the prime minister’s contentious captain’s picks in key New South Wales seats. The court on Friday refused businessman Matthew Camenzuli’s application for special leave to appeal against the NSW court of appeal’s decision upholding the controversial preselections. Chief justice Susan Kiefel said the appeal had “insufficient prospects of success”. Morrison and Labor leader Anthony Albanese are already in full campaign mode, barnstorming marginal seats across the country. But the prime minister is expected to visit the governor-general this weekend, triggering an election in mid-May. The court’s decision removes a significant distraction from the opening days of the campaign. It also ensures that a key Morrison ally, the immigration minister Alex Hawke, as well as environment minister Sussan Ley and leading moderate MP Trent Zimmerman, will be endorsed to contest the election. With a dispute over Morrison’s insistence on his preferred candidates triggering visceral conflict in the New South Wales division of the Liberal party, Camenzuli had asked the court for an order restraining party officials from sending the candidates’ names to the electoral commissioner. But on Wednesday, the NSW state director, Chris Stone, used his special campaign powers to expel Camenzuli after he was charged with imperilling the party’s election chances. With the factional score-settling and the election-eve legal challenges disrupting Morrison’s efforts to focus the conversation on his preferred political territory of the economy and national security, the prime minister declared earlier this week he was insisting on his preferred candidates because he wanted to stand up “for the women in my team”. While some colleagues privately accuse Morrison of using the preselections to shore up his own power base, the prime minister said his only agenda was “ensuring we put the best candidates in the field to ensure that our government could put the best foot forward to ensure we continue to have a strong economy”. On the hustings in Victoria on Friday, Morrison was asked by reporters when he would call the election. He replied: “Well, electoral terms go for three years. “The last election was on the 18th of May and the next election will be held at about the same time,” the prime minister said. Asked whether that meant Sunday, Morrison said: “We will know very soon.” As Morrison runs down the clock before visiting the governor-general, the prime minister is characterising Albanese as a “blank page” as part of efforts to present a change of government as too big a risk for voters to take in uncertain times. The prime minister on Friday acknowledged voters were currently unhappy with him and the government. “Now, I know not all decisions that I’ve taken, everyone’s agreed with. I know that not every government is perfect, particularly in times like this.” But he said voters knew who he was and what he stood for. “I know what our policies are. I know who my teams are, my team is. I’m not pretending to be anyone else,” Morrison said. “I’m standing by my record and the plans that I have for the future. And this election campaign is a choice. It’s a choice between the strong economy that delivers a stronger future, and a weaker economy under the weaker economic management of the Labor party.” Campaigning in Adelaide with the new state premier, Peter Malinauskas, Albanese expressed frustration that Morrison had not yet called the election. “I feel like putting in a phone call to the prime minister, if he doesn’t know where the governor-general lives, and offer him a lift to [from] the Lodge to call this election.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Albanese said Morrison was delaying the official call of the contest “so that he can continue to spend taxpayer funds on election ads in the name of the government – but they’re really about promoting the Liberal-National parties”, and to continue to make appointments to government bodies. The Labor leader declared it was time for Morrison to call the election and “let the Australian people decide”. “If you look across the board at this government’s performance, there’s a trillion dollars of debt and no legacy to show for it.”",News/Australia news,High court win on NSW preselections clears way for Morrison to call election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/high-court-win-on-nsw-preselections-clears-way-for-morrison-to-call-election
4/8/2022,"A New South Wales barrister who continued to work as a lawyer despite not having a practising certificate – including in a case before the high court – has been sentenced to a suspended jail term. Michael Rollinson pleaded guilty to three counts of contempt in the NSW supreme court last month. In orders released by the court on Friday, NSW supreme court Justice Robert Beech-Jones described his conduct as “breathtaking”. The NSW bar association alleged Rollinson had failed to pay the entirety of his practising certificate renewal fees for the 2021-22 practice year. Beech-Jones found each breach represented a serious challenge to the court’s authority that was exacerbated by Rollison’s status “as an officer of the very court he deliberately and repeatedly defied”. Rollinson had performed most aspects of the practice of a barrister despite not having a certificate, Beech-Jones found, including acting in matters from local courts to the high court of Australia. “His conduct reveals a breathtaking and flagrant disregard for this court’s authority,” Beech-Jones said in relation to the second count. “The third contempt is equally breathtaking. [Rollinson] was specifically told, and then ordered, by a supreme court judge not to appear in the local court at Wollongong the following day yet he did so.” Rollinson had been a barrister since 1995. In an apology for his actions, which was included in Beech-Jones’ orders, he wrote: “My conduct in regard to all the above incidents was unacceptable and contrary to the standards of conduct expected of a barrister, and I apologise for that conduct. “I felt that the solicitors who had been instructing me depended on me to continue. I felt significant loyalty to them. I was reluctant to tell them I did not have a practising certificate as I felt that I would be letting them down. “I also did not want my predicament of not having a practising certificate to get more publicity than it had to because I found it embarrassing.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He was also found to have had a personality disorder which may have contributed to his conduct. Mark Robinson SC, an experienced barrister who had worked with Rollinson on multiple cases, described him as “exceptionally loyal”. “I have never observed him to be anything other than law-abiding, truthful, reliable and dependable,” Robinson wrote in an affidavit. He said the charges were “exceptions to his otherwise excellent legal career” and he would be “happy to work with him again in the future”. Beech-Jones found that Rollinson’s personality disorder potentially contributed to his commission of the contempts, but did not accept that it materially reduced his moral culpability or the need for general deterrence. “Someone who assumes the responsibilities of counsel and is able to function effectively as such for over 20 years does not have their moral culpability reduced because an apparently long‑standing personality disorder may have impacted on a deliberate refusal to comply with a court order,” he said. “If a person can function in a highly regulated system with a particular condition for over 20 years then the existence of that condition does not diminish such a blatant disregard for court orders.” Rollinson was sentenced to nine month’s imprisonment, suspended for three years. He was also ordered to pay the costs of the NSW bar association in relation to earlier court hearings.",News/Law,NSW lawyer given suspended jail term for working without a practicing certificate,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/08/nsw-lawyer-given-suspended-jail-term-for-working-without-a-practicing-certificate
