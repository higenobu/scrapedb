3/21/2022,"From a football-only perspective, the winner of the Cleveland Browns-Houston Texans blockbuster trade for Deshaun Watson is worthy of debate. The Texans shipped the 26-year-old quarterback to the Browns in exchange for three first-round picks, plus a third- and fourth-rounder. In addition, Watson will reportedly receive $230m in guaranteed money. That’s a boatload of capital to invest in any player, and Watson will need to give the Browns several years of production to make the deal worth it for Cleveland from a football perspective. Franchise quarterbacks drive organizations: great ones are worth breaking the bank for. But in trading for Watson, the Browns sold their soul. Of course, Watson is no ordinary player. He’s a multi-faceted – and arguably generational – talent who led the league in passing yards in 2020. He is a three-time Pro Bowler who holds the NFL record for highest career completion percentage. The Browns salivated at those stats, all the while minimizing a far more significant number: 22. Twenty-two women who happen to be massage therapists have accused Watson of sexual assault or misconduct. According to the initial complaint, Watson requested massages through Instagram and asked the therapists to focus on his groin area. He is accused of demanding a specific focus on his groin area and then positioning himself so the therapist was forced to feel his erect penis. Similar accounts were later shared by the other therapists who signed onto the complaint and filed civil suits. The Texans sidelined Watson for the entire 2021 while the legal proceedings played out and the NFL launched its own investigation which is still ongoing. Meanwhile, the Browns must have concurrently launched their own investigation because exactly one week after a grand jury decided not to indict Watson on criminal charges (he still faces civil lawsuits) after a year-long police investigation, he became Cleveland’s starting quarterback. Watson has denied the allegations against him as “baseless”. But even though he will not face criminal charges, the mere fact that a professional athlete, with access to highly trained therapists at his own team, was seeking massages on social media does not look good. The Browns wouldn’t have insulted our intelligence if they had simply said: “Our new quarterback may be an alleged serial sexual predator, but, damn, he’s a good player.” Instead, they did just that when they issued statements defending the move, first from owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam: And then from general manager Andrew Berry: And finally from head coach Kevin Stefanski: Many words ring hollow in each of these statements. But the emptiest are the Haslams’ claims that they are “empathetic to the personal sentiments expressed by this decision.” The very next line touts their “comprehensive evaluation process” which in the NFL is code for “not very comprehensive” when used to try and appease a fanbase. As is commonplace with teams who make deals for players with allegations hovering over them, there are no specifics as to what this comprehensive evaluation involved. Who did the team speak with aside from Watson? According to attorney Tony Buzbee who is representing the 22 women in their civil cases, neither he nor any of his clients were contacted by the Browns. It’s hard to fathom who would be more relevant to contact. Maybe the Browns asked Watson’s friends and family if he is a good guy and then called it a day. Or perhaps the “comprehensive evaluation” involved watching film of Watson slaying the Falcons in 2019 for 426 yards, five touchdowns and a perfect passer rating from a multitude of angles. Browns fans aren’t stupid, neither are other fanbases. We all know how the league operates. Talent trumps trouble. It would be so much simpler if the Browns admitted this very obvious fact instead of acting like they considered the moral compass of their fans. There is zero morality here from the Browns. There are 22 women with ongoing civil cases against Watson. Instead of privately sharing their accounts with Browns’ brass, they’re in the same position as all of us. They too get to read some mumbo jumbo from the Haslams about Watson’s “devotion to helping others within the NFL.” The only difference is these 22 women, if telling the truth, have to follow the long list of survivors enduring the psychological damage of seeing their alleged assaulter publicly rewarded. The Browns’ egregious handling of the trade is further rooted in Watson’s contract. Five years, $230m guaranteed. It’s the most guaranteed money in NFL history. If it were virtually anyone else, this move would be applauded given the players’ fight for fully guaranteed contracts. But the crucial detail is that he is only due to be paid $1m in salary in the first year of his contract. That way, if he is suspended by the NFL over the assault allegations, he will lose less money than if he was owed the $46m in salary he is due in each of the next four years. Watson may or may not deserve a chance to continue his career. That’s dependent on where the truth lies. Yet even the idea of an alleged serial sexual predator with a host of ongoing civil lawsuits against him leading an NFL team is disturbing. If the Browns were so worried about the “personal sentiments” of fans, why couldn’t they wait until after the NFL and civil investigations are over until they decide whether to trade for him? But at least Watson has a strong arm and can help the Browns win a few more games. Just say that next time, Cleveland.",Sport/Sport,The Browns’ mock-humility over the Deshaun Watson trade is laughable,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/deshaun-watson-sexual-assault-allegations-cleveland-browns-nfl-football-contract
3/21/2022,"Jamaican campaigners have accused the Queen of perpetuating slavery, in a letter urging the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to atone for colonialism during their Caribbean tour. As the country celebrates 60 years of independence, a coalition of Jamaican politicians, business leaders, doctors and musicians have called in the open letter for the British monarchy to apologise for colonialism and pay slavery reparations. Prince William and Kate’s visit is seen as a charm offensive to persuade other Caribbean nations not to follow Barbados in removing the Queen as head of state this year. “We note with great concern your visit to our country, Jamaica, during a period when we are still in the throes of a global pandemic and bracing for the full impact of another global crisis associated with the Russian/Ukraine war,” the letter states. “We see no reason to celebrate 70 years of the ascension of your grandmother to the British throne because her leadership, and that of her predecessors, has perpetuated the greatest human rights tragedy in the history of humankind.” The group, which calls itself the Advocates Network, is expected to stage a protest on Tuesday outside the British High Commission in Kingston to coincide with the royals’ arrival in Jamaica. The Cambridges are due to stay in Jamaica until Thursday when they will depart for the Bahamas. The letter urges the Queen and the UK government to give “an apology for British crimes against humanity, including but not limited to the exploitation of the indigenous people of Jamaica, the transatlantic trafficking of Africans, the enslavement of Africans, indentureship and colonialisation.” It cites an “offensive and insensitive” address in 2015 by the then prime minister, David Cameron, in which he urged Jamaica to “move on from this painful legacy” and praised British leadership in ending the “horrors of slavery”. Noting that William and Kate are “direct beneficiaries of the wealth accumulated by the royal family over centuries”, the letter urges the couple to “redefine the relationship between the British monarchy and the people of Jamaica”, starting by acknowledging the need for atonement and reparations. The campaigners contrast this with the Queen’s failure to “redress and atone for the suffering of our ancestors” during her 70 years on the throne. The tour has been mired in controversy, with the royals forced to cancel their first trip, in Belize, after opposition from villagers who cited a range of issues including objections to the Cambridges’ helicopter landing site. Caribbean experts and Windrush campaigners have called for the royals to help Caribbean nations sever ties with the monarchy rather than persuade them to keep the Queen as head of state since they say this prevents them from achieving true independence. The Cambridges are scheduled to visit ancient Maya ruins deep in the heartland of Belize on Monday. The couple will also attend a reception in celebration of the Queen’s platinum jubilee hosted by the governor general of Belize at the Maya ruins at Cahal Pech, near San Ignacio, where William is due to give a speech. During their first full day in Belize on Sunday, the couple toured a cocoa farm and danced during a cultural visit to a nearby village.",News/UK news,Jamaican campaigners call for colonialism apology from royal family,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/jamaican-campaigners-call-for-colonialism-apology-from-royal-family
3/21/2022,"Ukraine has rejected out of hand an ultimatum from Moscow to surrender the devastated city of Mariupol, as authorities in Odesa accused Russia of striking residential areas in what would be the invading forces’ first attack on the Black Sea port. Odesa city council said on Monday apartment blocks in the city’s outskirts had been hit by airstrikes, causing no casualties but starting a fire. Overnight shelling in Kyiv, reduced a large shopping mall to rubble and killed at least eight people. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the government had “of course” rejected a Russian ultimatum for people in Mariupol to surrender before 5am on Monday, but said the situation in the besieged city was “very difficult”. Ukraine also turned down Moscow’s offer to open two humanitarian corridors out of Mariupol in exchange for its residents’ capitulation. Hundreds of thousands of people have been trapped in the city, many without water, heat or power, for more than a fortnight. Officials have said at least 2,300 residents have died, with some buried in mass graves. “There can be no question of any surrender, laying down of arms” in the stricken Black Sea port, Vereshchuk said. Mariupol’s mayor, Piotr Andryushchenko, said in a Facebook post that he did not need to wait until the 5am deadline to reject the offer. As EU foreign and defence ministers gathered in Brussels to discuss further sanctions on Moscow, authorities in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, said airstrikes in the Podil district had flattened a shopping centre and severely damaged several apartment blocks. “According to the information we have at the moment, several homes and one of the shopping centres were hit,” Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said, adding that rescue services were still putting out a large fire at the shopping centre. Ukraine’s prosecutor general said eight people had died in the bombardment. The prosecutor also said a Russian shell had struck a chemical plant outside the eastern city of Sumy at about 3am on Monday, causing a leak in a 50-ton tank of ammonia. A Russian military spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, claimed the leak was a “planned provocation” by Ukrainian forces to falsely accuse Russia of a chemical attack, adding that Russian forces had killed 80 foreign and Ukrainian troops in an overnight cruise missile strike on a military training centre in the Rivne region of western Ukraine. Military experts have warned that Moscow’s forces, denied an early victory, are increasingly turning to the scorched earth tactics of previous offensives in Syria and Chechnya, pulverising population centres with airstrikes and artillery bombardments. Russia’s ground advance has stalled along most fronts, with its forces held up by highly effective Ukrainian resistance and major logistical problems, so far failing to capture a single major Ukrainian city since the invasion started on 24 February. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Monday Russia’s assault on Kyiv had largely ground to a halt, although heavy fighting was continuing near Hostomel, a suburb to the north-west. It has warned, however, of more “indiscriminate shelling of urban areas, widespread destruction, and large numbers of civilian casualties” to come. The UN has said more than 10 million people, a quarter of Ukraine’s prewar population, have been displaced by the conflict, including 3.4 million who have fled abroad, mainly to Poland. It has also confirmed more than 900 civilian deaths, though the actual figure is likely be significantly higher. Conditions in some encircled and heavily bombarded cities in the south, such as Mariupol, and east, such as Kharkiv, Sumy and Chernihiv, are atrocious, with whole urban areas pulverised by airstrikes and artillery shells. The mayor of Kharkiv, Igor Terekhov, said hundreds of buildings, many of them residential, have been destroyed in the country’s second largest city. “It is impossible to say that the worst days are behind us. We are constantly being bombed, there was shelling again overnight,” he said. Manolis Androulakis, Greece’s consul general in Mariupol and the last EU diplomat to leave the city, said that what he had seen “I hope no one will ever see. Mariupol will become part of a list of cities that were completely destroyed by war. I don’t need to name them: they are Guernica, Coventry, Aleppo, Grozny, Leningrad.” Russian airstrikes have hit a theatre in Mariupol where more than 1,300 civilians were thought to be sheltering and an art school sheltering a further 400 people. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Monday people were “still under the rubble, and we don’t know how many of them have survived”. On the diplomatic front, the US president. Joe Biden. was due to call the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Britain on Monday to discuss the war, before travelling later in the week to Brussels and on to Poland for in-person talks. EU foreign and defence ministers were meeting on Monday to discuss imposing further sanctions on Moscow, in particular whether to introduce an oil embargo. Along with the US, UK and other western countries, the bloc has imposed four rounds of punitive measures on Russia, including freezing the Russian central bank’s assets. “It’s unavoidable we start talking about the energy sector, and we can definitely talk about oil because it is the biggest revenue to Russia’s budget,” Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said as he arrived at the Brussels meeting. The EU was also set to approve a new defence strategy aimed at increasing the bloc’s capacity to act, including setting up a 5,000-strong rapid reaction force. “It’s not the answer to the Ukrainian war, but it is part of the answer,” the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said.",News/World news,Ukraine rejects Moscow’s Mariupol ultimatum as airstrikes hit Odesa and Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/ukraine-rejects-moscow-mariupol-ultimatum-as-airstrikes-hit-odesa-and-kyiv
3/21/2022,"The way Tammy Abraham tells it, his decision to join Roma came down to a desire to enjoy a little more vitamin D. He has recounted many times the story of how José Mourinho opened his sales pitch last summer with a simple question: “Do you want to enjoy some sun or stay in the rain?” Yet the real question was a more profound one: was Abraham ready to give up the familiarity and comfort of England for a chance to make his name somewhere different. He had scored goals at Chelsea – 30 in all competitions across the preceding two seasons – yet seen his opportunities reduced by a manager, Thomas Tuchel, who confessed to not trusting him. At Roma, Abraham would have a chance to be the main man, taking over the No 9 shirt vacated by Edin Dzeko. The €40m (£34m) fee agreed between the Giallorossi and Chelsea was the highest paid by any Serie A club for a player last summer. By accepting the move, Abraham was not so much stepping into the sunshine as the spotlight. He has thrived under it. Despite a dry run from late September, when he went seven games without scoring, Abraham had to 21 goals in all competitions by last Thursday – matching Gabriel Batistuta and Vincenzo Montella’s first-season tallies with two months to spare. He had hit the woodwork seven times besides. It was his 90th-minute strike against Vitesse that delivered Roma to the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League. Not the most glamorous achievement for a player who was part of a Champions League-winning squad at Chelsea last season, but indicative of a tendency to show up when his team needs him most. He struck the winner, too, against Atalanta – rivals for a spot in next season’s European competitions – at the start of the month. The one item missing from his first-season account was a goal in the derby against Lazio. This season’s first meeting had ended with a 3-2 defeat and Maurizio Sarri celebrating with an eagle. Mourinho feared that the timing of Sunday’s rematch could not have been worse. “I’m happy that we got through,” he said after the win over Vitesse, “but less happy that we had players on the pitch who will also need to be there against Lazio – who are at home smoking cigarettes with Sarri.” His counterpart took it in good humour, replying that Mourinho was “late” with that jab: “I stopped smoking a few days ago”. He had no such ready responses for the difficulties his team would run into as soon as the match began. If Roma were supposed to be the team with tired legs, then Abraham swept Lazio’s from underneath them with a goal inside the first minute. After Lorenzo Pellegrini’s corner rebounded off the crossbar, the striker was perfectly positioned to bundle the ball over the line. A dream start for Roma ✨Tammy Abraham scrambles the ball over the line for an incredible start to the Derby 🟡🔴 pic.twitter.com/BTKaJHPnko It was the fastest strike ever in a Serie A Rome derby, recorded officially at 56 seconds. Abraham followed it up with another goal in the 22nd minute– taking him to 23 for the season. This time it was a slick team move, with Bryan Cristante feeding Henrikh Mkhitaryan down the right and the Armenian nudging the ball on for Rick Karsdorp to cross. Abraham perfectly timed his run into the six-yard box to volley home. The game was effectively over, Roma enjoying total control. Abraham ought to have completed a hat-trick when Bryan Cristante sent him through on goal with a long pass at the start of the second half, but instead fired wide of the right-hand post. No matter. Lorenzo Pellegrini had made it 3-0 before half-time with a sensational free-kick, curled into the top right-hand corner with such precision that even an alert Thomas Strakosha could only brush it with his fingertips on the way in. Mourinho was a spectacle all on his own, furiously gesturing to Roma’s ultras to stop the “olé” chants that began to take hold before the interval. They obeyed. The manager has drawn plenty of media criticism this season yet supporters have bought into his work so wholeheartedly that they are even willing to tolerate him taking shots at Zdenek Zeman. The former Roma manager, whose attacking football and willingness to speak uncomfortable truths to power made him a cult hero for fans of the club, said last week that Sarri was doing better a job than Mourinho. The latter shot back: “You can’t expect a manager with 25 titles to respond to someone who won twice in Serie B.” Mourinho’s first season in Rome has been a mixed bag. Even after beating Lazio, Roma remain eight points adrift of the Champions league places, and his post-game remarks suggested he does not believe that gap can be bridged in the remaining eight games. Should it not be considered a failure for a team that reached the Europa League semi-finals last season, and spent more than €120m on transfers since, to be out of that race so soon? Yet Roma’s results are improving. They are unbeaten in nine league games – even if they have required several late goals along the way. More encouraging has been Mourinho’s growing willingness to integrate players from Roma’s hugely successful youth team. The 20-year-old wing-back, Nicola Zalewski, caught the eye in his fourth start on Sunday. Perhaps most important, though, is that key individuals at the centre of this project seem to be responding to Mourinho’s methods. Pellegrini has produced his best season for Roma despite various stints sidelined by injury and illness. Abraham, above all, has gone beyond even the most optimistic pre-season expectations. Bologna 0-1 Atalanta, Cagliari 0-1 Milan, Empoli 1-1 Verona, Genoa 1-0 Torino, Internazionale 1-1 Fiorentina, Juventus 2-0 Salernitana, Napoli 2-1 Udinese, Roma 3-0 Lazio, Sassuolo 4-1 Spezia, Venezia 0-2 Sampdoria It is not only a question of goals. Abraham’s furious commitment to applying Roma’s high press has been fundamental to the way the team plays. After being called up by England in November, the striker credited Mourinho with turning him into a “monster”. The numbers show that he is attempting, and winning, tackles at a rate at least 20% higher than any other time in his career – and 50% higher than his final season at Chelsea. During an interview with CBS before Sunday’s derby, the player confessed to still being “starstruck” by Mourinho despite seeing him every day, remembering him as the first-team manager of the Chelsea side he was graduating into from the club’s youth team in 2015. “I’ve never told him this,” said Abraham, “but I still look up to him as an idol.” A growing number of people in Rome look at him the same way. Abraham’s goals on Sunday mean he has now scored more times in 2022 than any other striker in Europe’s top five leagues besides Robert Lewandowski. At full time he stood with his teammates under the Curva Sud and heard supporters chant his name over and over. Invited to share his emotions during a post-game interview, Abraham replied: “I can’t. I can’t describe how they make me feel.” Better, we assume, than he would have done, sitting at home in the rain.",Sport/Football,Tammy Abraham’s goals rain in as derby win continues sunny spell at Roma | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/21/tammy-abraham-roma-goals-rome-derby-win-lazio-serie-a
3/21/2022,"Scottish Opera’s occasional opera-in-concert series has been a great platform for works that will never see a main-stage production and here it proved to be so again. This one-off performance was a double bill of one-act operas based on works by Pushkin, apparently a remnant of a Russian opera in concert series that was mothballed by Covid. For all that this might seem an inopportune moment for Russian opera, the composers Rachmaninov and Stravinsky, both with links to Ukraine, were themselves no strangers to exile and loss. Only Rachmaninov’s work, The Miserly Knight, was written for Russia. Premiered in Moscow in 1906 – and here receiving a very belated Scottish premiere – this is a dark tale of an English baron obsessed with hoarding his wealth and controlling his son through the purse strings while external forces try to manipulate the family dynamic, leading almost inevitably to patricide. Written for five male voices and with a lush orchestral score rich in writing for dark-hued clarinet and cello, this was a lugubrious yet sumptuous work. The vocal writing provided moments of contrast: particularly the son, Alexey Dolgov in dialogue with money lender Alasdair Elliott, the former’s high-set heroic tenor contrasting with the latter’s reedier character tenor. Most striking was the scene where the Baron, Scottish Opera regular baritone Roland Wood, sits in his cellar surrounded by his treasure. The orchestral score, as sepulchral as the setting, rises to a moment of astonishing metallic-hued ecstasy at the climax, a portent of Bartók’s later Duke Bluebeard’s Castle as well as the closing gesture of Rachmaninov’s great final work, the Symphonic Dances. Not even two decades separate the composition of The Miserly Knight and Stravinsky’s Mavra, but it might as well be a different world. This is a work from Stravinsky’s Parisian era, a period that encompassed both the calculated primitivism of The Rite of Spring and the cool modernity of Oedipus Rex. Mavra, an epigrammatic comedy about a saucy girl who disguises her lover as a maid in order to smuggle him into the house under the nose of her mother, has a foot firmly in both camps. The music, all spiky sardonic woodwind writing, belongs to the Parisian 1920s of Cocteau and Satie. The vocal writing, by contrast, harks back to the sound world of Tchaikovsky. It’s a short work, but one with a great deal of charm, emphasised here by Anush Hovhannisyan and Dolgov as the pair of lovers. Dolgov, in particular, has great fun in drag has the hapless maid “Mavra” – a complete contrast to his role in the first half of the programme. Laura Attridge’s minimal props and stage direction added a little visual interest to accompany excellent vocal performances without being obtrusive. The biggest star of the evening, however, was the orchestra of Scottish Opera and conductor Stuart Stratford who gave fine, nuanced accounts of these two very different scores.",Arts/Music,The Miserly Knight/Mavra review – Russian opera double-bill sees Scottish Opera shine,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/21/the-miserly-knight-mavra-review-rachmaninov-stravinsky-scottish-opera
3/21/2022,"More than 23 million young children across southern Africa will be offered vaccinations against wild polio after an outbreak of the virus was detected in Malawi for the first time since 1992. Children under five in Lilongwe, Malawi’s capital, began to be immunised on Sunday as part of a mass drive against the disease. Over the next four months, vaccines will be offered to children across the country and in Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Last month, Malawi recorded the first case of wild polio in 30 years, and the first in Africa since the region was certified free of indigenous wild poliovirus in 2020. So far only one case has been detected in Lilongwe. There are three variants of wild or naturally occurring virus, which is the most common type of polio. Two types have been eradicated (WPV2 and WPV3), while WPV1 only remains endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan. There is also a very rare vaccine-derived poliovirus, which is a variant of the weakened poliovirus initially included in the oral polio vaccine. “In support of Malawi and its neighbours, we are acting fast to halt this outbreak and extinguish the threat through effective vaccinations,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, regional director for Africa at the World Health Organization, which is supporting the vaccine campaign. “The African region has already defeated wild poliovirus due to a monumental effort by countries. We have the knowhow and are tirelessly working to ensure that every child lives and thrives in a continent free of polio.” Dr Randy Mungwira, WHO deputy incident manager for polio response in Malawi, told the Guardian his team had “meticulously planned” to contact every child in the country. He said the recent outbreak was a threat to previous efforts to eradicate the disease. “We want to make sure that our children are protected from this,” he said. “We do not want to see children paralysed from polio in the next few years. We want to stop that.” The country has set up 11 surveillance sites in four cities: Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba. Malawi’s health minister, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, said the government had set up emergency committees at national and district levels to monitor cases and assess the risk of the virus spreading. The WHO said the region’s certification as free of wild polio remained unchanged. Laboratory analysis linked the WPV1 variant detected in Malawi to one circulating in Pakistan’s Sindh province in 2019.",News/Global development,Millions of children to be vaccinated for polio in Africa after Malawi detects case,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/21/millions-of-children-to-be-vaccinated-for-polio-in-africa-after-malawi-detects-case
3/21/2022,"Acouple of days before her death in February 2021, Mary Wilson uploaded a video to her YouTube channel. Poignantly, it was full of forthcoming plans: the 60th anniversary of the Supremes’ debut single the following month; interviews she’d given for Black History Month, discussing the problems the group had faced touring the south of America in the 1960s; videos she was planning to upload, including a tribute to Florence Ballard, the former Supreme who had died 45 years previously, aged 32, after a struggle with alcoholism that had seen her fired from the group in 1967. Her voice catches slightly when she mentions Ballard’s name: Wilson never gave up on her, even when Ballard appeared to have given up on herself. “She was always trying to help her,” says Wilson’s friend, actor Beverly Todd. “Mary loved Florence and she understood why Florence was in so much pain” – Wilson believed her alcoholism had less to do with the pressures of fame than the fact that Ballard had been raped at knifepoint in 1960 – “and she would invite her to become part of what she was doing. The last time, she was trying to get Florence back involved with the Supremes, but Florence told her, ‘Mary, why do you keep trying to help? Stop trying to help me.’” That aside, the tone of the video is one of huge excitement. Wilson seems particularly thrilled that a collection of her solo work is about to be released, including her eponymous 1979 album, an extremely classy disco collection that had the misfortune to be released weeks after the Chicago Disco Demolition riot turned America’s radio and record labels against the sound it embodied; tracks she recorded for a follow-up with celebrated producer Gus Dudgeon that went unreleased when Motown dropped her from her contract; and some new recordings, including a song called Why Can’t We All Get Along? that ruminated on the strained relationship between the Supremes’ members. According to her daughter, Turkessa Babich, Wilson had been planning the collection for “about 20 years”: it’s now been released posthumously, as The Motown Anthology, augmented with Supremes tracks featuring Wilson’s lead vocals. You can see why Mary Wilson might have wanted her work reappraised. She died a celebrity, still more than capable of packing out venues. Despite a solo recording dogged by extraordinary bad luck – quite aside from the disco backlash and the collapse of her relationship with Motown, there was the string of 1980s singles she recorded for Atlantic that went unreleased and the label that went bust the day after releasing her 1992 album Walk the Line – she happily adjusted to a role as what Motown expert and author Adam White calls “a kind of historian”, creating a 2008 exhibition of the Supremes’ gowns at the V&A, lecturing and writing books. Her autobiography, Dreamgirl, is remembered today for its dish-served-cold depiction of Diana Ross as a nightmarish diva, willing to quite literally push her bandmates out of the spotlight, but it was also an important document of Motown at its height, its veracity boosted by the fact that Wilson had kept a diary from the age of 17. But for all her success, Wilson is underrated as a singer. She seldom took lead vocals with the Supremes – she sang or shared lead on just 28 songs over the band’s 16-year recording career. The Temptations’ Otis Williams thinks that “when she was singing behind Diana, you heard that personality, that glow”, but, as another Motown contemporary, Claudette Robinson of the Miracles puts it: “Sometimes if you’re, as they say, a background singer, people think that you can’t sing. They’re like, ‘oh, all they do are oohs and ahhs and whatever’, which is not true.” It certainly wasn’t true in Wilson’s case – she had a gorgeous voice, smoky and soft. Behind the sparkling gowns and the ministrations of Motown’s famous charm school (designed, as its late boss Maxine Powell put it, to remove the rough edges from artists “from the projects … using street language, some of them rude and crude”), the Supremes were tough girls. Quite aside from their hard upbringings in Detroit’s Brewster-Douglass projects, they endured life on the road in a segregated America, where, as Robinson says, “you’d go to venues and think that you had a hotel, I’d made reservations early on, but you’d get there and somebody might be there with a shotgun or a rifle by their leg … you were not welcome”. “Mary remembered being at a show in Miami in the 1960s,” says White, “and afterwards a white member of the audience came up to her and said, ‘I just love the Supremes, you’re wonderful – when you’re on television I let my family watch you.’ I mean, I still can’t quite believe someone would say that, but it’s a measure of the times and the prejudice that existed, and how the Supremes dealt with it and why they mattered. Their style and glamour made them attractive on TV – they were on the Ed Sullivan Show so often, and it reached into tens of millions of homes. They made a difference to the way the world evolved and to integration, I do believe that.” Everyone I speak to about Wilson talks about her kindness and generosity, but everyone also agrees that she had a core of steel (“oh my God, Mary was a fighter,” laughs Todd). How tough she was became apparent when Diana Ross left the group in 1970. The general consensus was that the band were finished without their star, but Wilson thought otherwise, battling Motown over Ross’s replacement and guiding the Ross-less Supremes to a string of hits. “She was determined to carry on the Supremes,” says Williams. “She was the glue that held the Supremes together, and please believe me, that’s a rough role to play. I’ve been playing it for 60 years trying to keep something together when it seems like all adversity is up in your face, so I admired and loved Mary for her sticking to it. She was a wonderful spirit.” The same toughness was evident when the Supremes finally split in 1977. Horrified at the sight of “fake” versions of classic soul bands touring without any original members – “she saw musicians suffering not getting paid, not getting recognised, having bogus groups go out there and perform after they worked their butts off to create this history,” remembers Babich – she first fought Motown for ownership of the band’s name, then became a lobbyist for the Truth in Music Advertising Act, aimed at stopping bands without original members passing themselves off as the definite article. It was subsequently enacted in 35 US states. She was appointed a US cultural ambassador by Colin Powell and became a tireless activist on behalf of another change in the law designed to bring fairer royalties to artists and songwriters for songs recorded before 1972. Wilson was noted both for her unusual brand of persuasion – she was apparently big on walking into congress members’ offices, bursting into Stop! In the Name of Love, then demanding, “Don’t you think that’s worth protecting?” – and, once again, her indomitability. “She would look [politicians] in the eyes,” noted one impressed onlooker, “and your only response was ‘yes, ma’am’”. “She was dynamic, she was outstanding, and what people will find out when they hear her album is that she could really sing,” says Robinson. “She had a voice, and she used her voice not only in the music world, but in the political world. She was supreme. She was and is supreme, always. Supreme in all that she did, supreme in all that she worked for.”  The Motown Anthology is out now.",Arts/Music,‘She was the glue that held the Supremes together’: Mary Wilson remembered ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/21/mary-wilson-the-supremes-remembered-motown
3/21/2022,"1 Why do you want to start your own business?Before splashing out on embossed business cards and fancy office furniture, it’s worth doing a little soul-searching. Sleepless nights and nailbiting panic are all features of the first few months as an entrepreneur, and could stretch finances and push relationships to the limit. The good news? An unbridled passion for your product or service will override all this. Focusing on your interests is a good start: businesses such as Harley-Davidson, among many others, were born after the founders decided to monetise their passions. 2 Are you ready to become a business owner?Don’t tell your boss where to stick it just yet. Take around six months to develop your product or service, build your website and line up initial clients. Learn as much about your market as possible: can you freelance or volunteer somewhere to find out more? Start saving too, to give yourself a safety net while you get your business off the ground. If your living room is submerged in postal sacks and cardboard boxes by the end of this six-month period, it’s a sign your burgeoning business is going well. 3 Who’s your target audience?Determining the demand for your business is much easier if you have a customer in mind. But what does this mythical consumer look like? How old are they? Are they local or international? More crucially, how can your product or service make their lives better? 4 Have you researched the market?Now’s the time to take a deep dive into the market, identifying any trends by scouring through trade publications. Have a squiz at possible competitors: how can you differentiate your offering from theirs? You can also test your business. If you have a food product, for example, try selling an initial batch at a local market, asking customers about their likes and dislikes. 5 Have you got a website?Thankfully you don’t need an army of designers and SEO experts: GoDaddy can help you create a slick-looking website within minutes. Whether you want a minimalistic homepage with skeletal contact details, a flashy e-commerce supersite with payment portals and shopping carts, or just somewhere to host your thought leadership blogs and videos of your cat, GoDaddy’s Website Builder service will tailor your digital offering towards your customers’ needs, and sort your SEO too. Prices start from £5.99 a month, which includes 24/7 support from GoDaddy’s team of web professionals (yes, even at 3am). Meanwhile, its e-commerce model (just £15.99 a month) will enable you to accept credit card, PayPal, Square, Stripe, Apple Pay and Google Pay payments, plus set up free shipping options. 6 What’s your business plan?A business plan will provide you with a blueprint to gauge how your business is performing, plus help attract investors or even secure a loan. A typical business plan includes a description of your business, any goals or targets, an overview of your customers, competitors and the market, your marketing and promotional strategy, plus any financial forecasts. GoDaddy has a guide to writing a business plan here. 7 Have you got your finances in order?About 60% of small businesses go bust within the first five years, with lack of cashflow being a prime culprit. Try to set aside at least six months’ living expenses before quitting your day job. Calculate any costs: how much do you need to develop your product and buy stock? Will you be buying equipment, such as computers? Renting an office or WFH? Although understanding a profit and loss statement is a huge help, cloud-based accounting software such as Xero, QuickBooks and FreeAgent are easy to use. Also consider hiring an accountant, who’ll inform you what expenses can be claimed for things such as equipment and property. 8 How will you fund your business?Splurging through your savings is one way of bankrolling your business, as is begging your bank for a loan or writing to all the rich people you’ve ever met. Or you could consider alternative funding. The state-owned British Business Bank offers loans of up to £25,000, along with mentoring and advice. Local authorities and agencies also offer grants, such as those issued by Local Enterprise Partnerships. Peer-to-peer lending sites such as Funding Circle can connect you with private investors, while the UK Business Angels Association has a directory of angel investors. Don’t forget you could also raise money from the public by pitching your business idea on crowdfunding platforms such as Crowdcube or Crowdfunder. 9 Do you know how to market and promote your business online?Businesses no longer need bank-draining budgets or to fire off 200 tweets a day if they want to plug their business. The GoDaddy Websites + Marketing service can help establish your presence on Facebook, Google (including Google Maps) and Yelp. It’ll also assist with email marketing (a great way of communicating and upselling to existing customers) and help navigate the social media minefield. Above all, it can generate sales: Websites + Marketing customers see an average increase of 18% in business revenue within their first year. 10 Have you registered your business?You can register as either a … Sole trader. A straightforward choice involving less paperwork, it’s ideal for freelancers and one-person bands. Sole traders register with HMRC and file a self-assessment tax return every year. Limited company. As a limited company your business will seem more credible and there are tax benefits too. But there are added reporting and record-keeping responsibilities. You’ll also need to pay corporation tax on your profits. Limited companies register with Companies House. 11 How will you target your customers more effectively?Finally, GoDaddy Insight is an AI-powered analytics tool whose algorithms help businesses accurately target customers who will be interested in their products by analysing data from a business’s website traffic, online sales and social media activity.

3/21/2022,"The right to license lucrative, online domain names favoured by cryptocurrency firms has become the latest battlefield in the escalating dispute between Mauritius and the UK over ownership of the Chagos Islands. The two letter address .io, which stands for Indian Ocean, is allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT). It is operated by a commercial firm nominally based in Diego Garcia, the largest of the Chagos islands and home to a US military base. The .io term is fashionable among online dealers and digital economy enthusiasts because the initials also stand for input/output, the process of sending and receiving data. Cryptocurrency firms and companies selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs) – created to turn digital art into tradeable videos or images – frequently select .io web addresses for their trading platforms. They are consequently more expensive. Both the Mauritian government and exiled Chagossians – forcibly removed by the UK from their homes in the early 1970s – are challenging British control over .io domain names on the grounds that Britain no longer has a legitimate claim to the Chagos Islands. The legal balance in favour of Mauritian arguments for sovereignty shifted decisively after decisions at the international court of justice (ICJ), the UN general assembly and the international tribunal of the law of the sea (Itlos) in 2019 and last year. Britain was found to have unlawfully separated the Chagos Islands from Mauritius before granting independence in 1968. The UK is defying UN votes and court judgments demanding the return of the islands, stressing that the ICJ ruling was only an “advisory opinion”. Legal advice drafted in New York for Mauritius – and seen by the Guardian – shows that the government in Port Louis is considering how to enforce its online authority. It comes after after an expedition last month to raise its flag over the outer islands in the archipelago. Mauritius’ strategic objectives are to “end the use of .io domain name by the United Kingdom or any entity acting on its behalf and to secure for the government of Mauritius revenues generated by any further use of the .io domain name”. IANA lists the Internet Computer Bureau (ICB) Ltd as the company that allocates the country code for .io domain names. The firm also controls sales of .ac domains related to part of another British overseas territory, the Ascension Islands. The IANA website records ICB’s address as: c/o Sure (Diego Garcia) Limited, Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territories, PSC 466 Box 59 FPO-AP 96595-0059, British Indian Ocean Territory. The firm was sold in 2017, reportedly for $70m. It has been bought again since then. The previous owner of ICB said in 2014 that profits from selling .io domain names are “distributed to the [British] authorities”. According to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, however, neither BIOT nor the UK government benefit from sales of .io domain names. A spokesperson said: “The UK has no doubt as to our sovereignty over the British Indian Ocean Territory, which we have held continuously since 1814. Mauritius has never held sovereignty over the territory and the UK does not recognise its claim.” Jagdish Koonjul, the Mauritian ambassador to the UN, said his government had contacted ICB through its Diego Garcia address asking them to deal in future with the Mauritian government. “We have written to Sure [in Diego Garcia] but they have only said they are looking at it,” he said. In a separate initiative, lawyers for the Chagos Refugees Group have also lodged a complaint about British control of the .io domain name with the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development). The ICB and its parent company were approached for comment.",News/World news,Mauritius challenges UK rights over Indian Ocean domain name,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/mauritius-challenges-uk-rights-over-indian-ocean-domain-name-chagos-islands
3/21/2022,"Groundwater resources in sub-Saharan Africa are enough to transform agriculture in the region and provide people with adequate safe water for their drinking and hygiene needs, if the resource can be better managed, researchers have said. Groundwater – found underground in aquifers, rocks and soils – makes up about 99% of all liquid freshwater on earth, and is abundant in much of Africa, but a lack of investment has left it untapped or poorly managed, two major studies have found. The reserves could be used for irrigation and to supply clean and safe water, but there is also a danger that if used unsustainably they could be rapidly depleted or polluted. Tim Wainwright, the chief executive of WaterAid UK, the charity behind one of the reports, said: “Our findings debunk the myth that Africa is running out of water. But the tragedy is that millions of people on the continent still do not have enough clean water to drink. There are vast reserves of water right under people’s feet, many of which are replenished every year by rainfall and other surface water, but they can’t access it because services are chronically underfunded.” WaterAid, along with the British Geological Society, found that most African countries could survive at least five years of drought, and some more than 50 years, on their groundwater reserves. Their study, entitled Groundwater: the world’s neglected defence against climate change, found that every sub-Saharan African country could supply 130 litres a day of drinking water per capita from groundwater without using more than a quarter of what can be renewed, and most using only about 10%. Separately, the UN’s annual World Water Development Report also concentrated on groundwater this year. It found that only 3% of farmland in sub-Saharan Africa was equipped for irrigation, and only 5% of that area used groundwater, even though groundwater is often abundant in the region. Richard Connor, lead author and editor of the UN report for Unesco, said groundwater was not being used in Africa because of a lack of investment in equipment and infrastructure, and a shortage of institutions, trained professionals and knowledge of the resource. Developing expertise in mapping and managing groundwater resources would be essential, he said. There are also dangers to over-exploiting groundwater. Some groundwater is quickly replenished as rain falls, but there are also aquifers that have lain undisturbed for millennia and even millions of years. This “fossil water” is now within reach of modern pumping methods, and has been effectively mined as such, for instance to build cities in the desert in the Middle East. This cannot last, as the water is not replaceable across human timescales. Connor pointed to other examples around the world of over-exploitation, in south Asia, parts of the US and Australia, where groundwater has been used unsustainably. In India, for instance, more than 30 years of incentives from government to farmers to extract water, without the development of accompanying governance structures to ensure the water was shared equitably and managed for the long-term, has led to rampant over-use, with groundwater depleted beyond its natural ability to recharge. That has left farmers fighting over a dwindling resource, with falling and increasingly polluted water tables. Connor said public participation was key, with local people being given rights and responsibilities over their resources, and the knowhow to extract and use groundwater efficiently and sustainably. He said this required investment: “It costs money to do it properly, and it can cost more money to manage sustainably than to mis-manage, in the short term. But the returns from good management are huge. Proper management will allow the resource to be available for generations.” For African countries, a further danger is that other countries may leap in to take advantage first. The Oakland Institute has published a separate study showing that big agricultural commodity companies from overseas are seeing a major opportunity in Africa. Researchers studied 15 cases of large-scale agricultural projects in 11 African countries, where big companies were given rights to land and water extraction. The report warned that in many cases, far from seeing benefits from the development, local people were often disadvantaged. “When irrigation infrastructure is established, it benefits private firms for large-scale agriculture, often for export crops, instead of local farmers and communities,” the report says. “People living in arid and semi-arid lands are severely impacted by large-scale irrigation projects that reduce available pastures, and prevent flood recession agriculture, while fences and canals cut through traditional routes of people and livestock.”",News/Environment,"Better use of groundwater could transform Africa, research says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/better-use-of-groundwater-could-transform-africa-research-says
3/21/2022,"When Anupa’s friend suggested they take a salsa dancing course in 2005, she wasn’t convinced it was a good idea. “I had to have my arm twisted to give it a go,” she says. “When we got there, I didn’t enjoy it that much: it was just dancing around with a load of sweaty strangers.” The course came to an end and Anupa was ready to give up. “My friend persuaded me to give it another go. I think she thought I’d get into it if I kept going.” They returned to find that two salsa classes had been merged into one, and several new people had joined. Anupa soon noticed Greg, who was also attending the class with friends. “He was a really good dancer – much better than me,” she says. “I’d been doing classes for a few weeks,” says Greg. “When I walked into the class, I spotted Anupa straight away and thought she was really attractive.” Over the next few weeks, they spent time together, but never long enough to start a real conversation. “We would dance together, and then you had to swap partners,” says Anupa. “We were always really upset when we ended up having to dance with someone else.” Although they’d flirted with each other, it wasn’t until the salsa group’s Christmas party that they grew closer. “We ended up talking a lot and then exchanging numbers so we could keep in contact over the break,” says Greg. After the holidays, they began meeting up before salsa class for drinks, often skipping lessons to go on dates. “We had the same sense of humour and we were both really sociable, so it just felt easy,” he says. Neither of them were interested in starting a serious relationship at the time. “I was looking to move away from Leicestershire for my first teaching job,” says Anupa. “And Greg was just happy living his life with friends. We became a couple at the end of January but we weren’t worried about where things were going in the long term.” That April they took a trip together to Barcelona. “We were both a bit worried it was too soon,” says Greg. “But that’s where we fell in love and realised we were serious about each other. It really cemented our relationship.” Instead of moving away, Anupa decided to look for a teaching job closer to home, while Greg continued to work in engineering. In 2007, they got married in New York. “It was meant to be in Central Park but it was pouring with rain, so we ended up doing it at the hotel, and they gave us the penthouse suite for the wedding,” says Anupa. “We managed to get back to the park the next day to take some pictures in the sunshine.” At the end of the year they spent seven weeks travelling around New Zealand and Australia. The couple didn’t move in together until they were married. “I’m from a Hindu family and, although we’re not very religious, I am quite traditional and thought it would be romantic,” says Anupa. “Greg made a huge effort with my family, too. He really tried to communicate with my grandma who doesn’t speak much English.” Greg says they were all very welcoming and they get on brilliantly. The couple have two children, born in 2009 and 2010. While Greg continued his work as an engineer, Anupa left her part-time teaching job during the pandemic to write a children’s book and launch an organisation that raises awareness about body image. Greg says they share similar values, which has kept their marriage strong. “We have had so much fun together and she’s such a caring person,” he says. “I’d often find little presents in my suitcase and notes in my lunchbox when I was away for work. It’s always been so easy and we love having adventures together.” Anupa says they also have the same attitudes to money and family. “I stayed at home with the children when they were young, and was proud to be a housewife,” she says. “We both have traditional values. We also love food, travel and spending time with our children, especially if we can be outside. We can’t wait for the world to open up so we can explore with them again.” Want to share your story?
