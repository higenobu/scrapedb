3/5/2022,"The owner of the Bullring and Brent Cross is reinventing its shopping centres by switching away from fashion retailers towards healthcare, hospitality and flexible workspaces after reporting a £429m loss. Hammerson said in future as much as a fifth of its portfolio could have switched to alternative uses including homes, hotels and offices. Fashion will go from occupying more than a third of space to about a sixth, according to the property group. Last year about 70% of the group’s deals were not in fashion, indicating the direction of travel. The group will also repurpose redundant department stores and other unwanted retail space by bringing in private clinics and work with the NHS, education operators and leisure operators. Rita-Rose Gagné, the chief executive of Hammerson, said: “The pandemic has accelerated trends in our operating environment, with people engaging with physical space in new ways. We own flagship destinations around which we can curate and reshape entire neighbourhoods and city centre spaces. “Our new strategy recognises the unique position that Hammerson has in urban locations and the opportunities to leverage our experience and capabilities to create appealing destinations, serving occupiers, customers and communities.” Gagné said the company was now focused on its “prime urban estates”, having sold off £623m of property since 2021 and cut its workforce by 18%. Those actions helped reduce net debt to £1.8bn by December, down £415m year-on-year. In the past few months Hammerson has also sold the Victoria Gate retail development in Leeds for £120m, and is on course to complete the sale of Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow for £70m by the end of March. The sales are part of £500m of assets expected to be offloaded over the next two years. The change in tack comes after a tough few years for the group and many other retail landlords as pandemic lockdown forced some retailers out of business while others delayed or failed to pay rents. The value of Hammerson’s portfolio fell be nearly 8% to £5.4bn for the year. The decrease followed a 21% fall in 2020. Retail incomes also continued to fall – down 16% to £241.6m. Hammerson made a loss of £429m in the year to 31 December, largely due to a £470m fall in the value of its properties. However, that compared with a £1.7bn deficit a year before.",News/Business,Bullring owner seeks to reinvent its shopping centres after £429m loss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/fashion-bullring-owner-seeks-to-reinvent-shopping-centres-after-429m-loss--hammerson
3/5/2022,"When Iman Abdikarim joined a WhatsApp group to help Ukrainian refugees on a whim earlier this week, it had only 17 members and only vague ideas of what it might do. By Friday morning, the medical student was directing a chaotic throng of arrivals inside Berlin’s main station, as Germany’s “welcome culture” returned to the foreground. The WhatsApp group now has almost 8,000 volunteers and is central to efforts to provide refugees with temporary accommodation, food and clothes. “I’ve been working 10 hours every day this week, and I’ve got to work shifts at the clinic at night”, said the 27-year-old with Somalian roots in an upbeat tone. “But we are learning what the people who come here need.” Her mobile phone buzzes every few seconds with new messages, some of them from Ukraine, others from more Berliners who want to help. Behind her back, another volunteer coordinator shouts into a megaphone: “If you speak Russian or Ukrainian, stay. If you don’t, please come back tonight”. Scenes at Berlin’s central station mirror those from the summer of 2015, when large parts of German civic society rallied to aid asylum seekers arriving from Syria. In terms of sheer numbers, however, the challenge is starker: at the height of the influx of arrivals in 2015 and 2016, authorities in Berlin had to coordinate shelter for about 700 people and struggled, temporarily repurposing sports halls. This Thursday alone, 6,500 refugees arrived in the city by train, according to Berlin’s senator for social affairs. In each of the previous two days more than 1,000 people have arrived. Operator Deutsche Bahn, which has been handing out free travel tickets to refugees from Ukraine, says it has doubled its number of direct trains to the Polish border. “We have to prepare for the fact that the largest movement of refugees since the end of the second world war is headed for Europe”, said senator Katja Kipping. “What we have seen so far is only the tip of the iceberg.” The hope in Germany’s administrative apparatus is that relaxed visa rules will avoid bottleneck situations: since 2017, Ukrainians with biometric passports have been able to travel to the Schengen zone and stay for 90 days out of every 180 without needing a visa. Sixteen-year-old Viktor Levchenko arrived at Berlin central station on Friday morning, with his mother and cousin, having left Kyiv 48 hours before. Carrying a backpack each and a paper bag with basic supplies such as flour, toilet rolls and soap given to them by volunteers, they waited on the cold ground floor of the station for a Berlin-based Ukrainian friend to pick them up and host them for a few days. “We are working out what to do”, Levchenko said. “For now, we must stay in Germany. But afterwards, we must go back”. After arriving in Berlin, they called his aunt and uncle who had stayed behind in Kyiv to serve in the military. As they were speaking over the phone, they could hear air raid sirens in the background. Even before Vladimir Putin’s army started its incursion on to Ukrainian soil last week, asylum applications in Germany had risen to a four-year high in 2021, following a drop during the first year of the pandemic. As shelters in the capital were close to full capacity at the start of the year, the senate proposed renting empty hotels and hostels on an ad hoc basis. On Friday, senator Kipping said the city was planning to erect a tent outside the central station that would provide temporary resting places and sanitary facilities to those arriving from Ukraine before they were transported by shuttle buses to shelters in Berlin or nearby cities like Leipzig. But until now, the brunt of the aid effort has been facilitated by volunteers, like Mirjam König, who was waiting by the side of arrival point at Hauptbahnhof with her toddler son on her arm. A cardboard sign rested on the buggy next to her: “One room for woman with 1/2 children”, it said. König said she had posted her offer of a room on a volunteering website three days earlier but did not get a response. “Maybe it’s more practical this way”, she said, while bouncing her son in her arms. “I wanted to exhaust all my options”. “If something like this happened to me, I would hope there will be people offering me their help too. When injustice happens on this earth, you want to do something about it.”",News/World news,‘Tip of the iceberg’: Berliners rally to welcome refugees from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/berliners-rally-to-support-ukraine-refugees-germany
3/5/2022,"The introduction of a £100,000 bonus if the winner can follow up at Cheltenham has revitalised the Morebattle Hurdle at Kelso, and eight of the 12 declared runners in Saturday’s renewal hold at least one entry at the Festival in less than two weeks’ time. The reappearance of Buveur D’Air, the Champion Hurdle winner in 2017 and 2018, also adds extra depth to what is now one of the season’s most valuable handicap hurdles, and Nicky Henderson’s runner has gone well fresh in the past. The 11-year-old does not hold a Festival entry, however, and is likely to be building towards Aintree in April, while rivals including Metier, Cormier and Faivoir all have fitness on their side and the added incentive of the six-figure bonus, which The Shunter landed at the first time of asking last season. Marginal preference is for Cormier (3.15), who posted a useful time when winning a competitive event at Cheltenham’s Trials fixture in January. Brian Ellison’s six-year-old can make the odd mistake but he remains lightly raced over hurdles and his latest run – from just a 4lb lower mark – suggests he is still improving. Newbury 1.15 If Stan Sheppard can get him away in front, Indy Five could be a tough opponent to pass at the business end. Kelso 1.32 North Lodge overcame clear signs of inexperience to remain unbeaten at Cheltenham in January. The odds-on favourite departed early there but a decent time implies that the form is solid. Newbury 1.50 A tightly handicapped field for the Greatwood Gold Cup but a 5lb rise for Glen Forsa seems more than fair after his first win since joining Charlie Longsdon last time. Kelso 2.05 Famous Bridge looked the likely winner when he unseated Brian Hughes two out over track and trip last time. He can make amends off a 1lb higher mark. Doncaster 2.20 Stamina for this step up to the three miles is the obvious question mark for Get A Tonic but she has a clear edge on form. Kelso 2.40 Espoir De Romay was still travelling strongly when he came down two out in a Grade One novice chaser at Aintree last season. The form of his comeback run at Carlisle now looks stronger than it did at the time and he can underline his potential here.

3/5/2022,"Ukraine’s foreign minister has backed the establishment of a special international tribunal to try Russia’s leaders for the crime of aggression against Ukrainians. The move is separate from the claim launched by 39 countries this week to hold Russia to account at the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, is starting an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the conduct of the war. The crime of aggression, by contrast, would give rise to prosecution under international law by allowing the instigators of the aggression to be put on trial regardless of how the war was conducted. The ICC cannot also have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, unless the Russian state agrees, which it would veto at the UN. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, speaking from the back of a car in Ukraine via video link to an event at London’s Chatham House on Friday, said: “We are fighting against an enemy that is much stronger than us. But international law is on our side, and hopefully it will make its own contribution to help us prevail. The question now is how the international community will respond. “An international tribunal will fill a gap. When bombs fall on your cities, when Russian soldiers rape women in the occupied cities, it is difficult to talk of the efficiency of international law. But it is the only tool of civilisation that is available to us so in the end all those that made this war possible are held to account. We need to fill the gap of the crime against aggression.” He recalled that 80 years ago representatives from nine nations met in London to set up a legal framework for the prosecution of war criminals of the second world war. The former prime minister Gordon Brown, one of the advocates of the plan, said the possibility of bringing Vladimir Putin to trial was realistic. He said the tribunal, modelled on the Nuremberg trials after the second world war, would investigate all those who planned the invasion and were complicit, including by providing finance. Brown said: “Buildings are being razed to the ground but not the spirit of the Ukrainian people, and by acting in solidarity with them we will signal that lawless aggression will not be tolerated anywhere on European soil.” The call on nations to agree to set up the tribunal has support from international lawyers, barristers and former judges, including Richard Goldstone, the former chief prosecutor at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Philippe Sands QC said it was clear that sanctions alone would not work. “If we are committed to standing up to a lawless naked act of aggression, we must not leave a stone unturned. When Charles de Gaulle met in London in 1942 it must have been unimaginable that Hitler would be put in the dock three years later.” He implied the existence of the tribunal might in itself weaken the support base of the Russian president, saying: “The imminence of the Nuremberg trials in 1945 led some in the inner circle to ask, ‘Do I really want to be associated with this? Am I willing to break ranks and to cut deals?’”",News/World news,Ukraine backs international tribunal plan to try Putin for crime of aggression,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-backs-plan-for-international-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-of-aggression
3/5/2022,"Employers added 678,000 jobs to the US workforce in February and the unemployment rate edged down to 3.8%, as the impact of the omicron coronavirus variant eased, workers began returning to offices en masse, and demand for services increased. Confounding expectations that the variant would dull workforce gains, the jobs data beat most economists’ forecasts by 240,000, with the total jobs added being 200,000 higher than the January figure. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics said: “Job growth was widespread, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, healthcare, and construction.” Despite the strong jobs figures, and unemployment nearing the pre-pandemic 50-year low of 3.5%, economists are concerned that the labor market is facing new, post-pandemic threats. These include soaring oil prices, geopolitical turmoil stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and a series of US interest rate increases beginning this month. “The stronger than expected 678,000 gain in non-farm payrolls in February and upward revisions to previous months’ gains is another sign that the real economy has considerable momentum, with the Omicron wave having surprisingly little impact,” said Michael Pearce, US economist at Capital Economics. “That will give the Fed greater confidence to push ahead with its planned policy tightening but, with wage growth now leveling off, there is arguably less pressure for officials to front-load an aggressive series of rate hikes over the coming months,” Pearce added. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that Russia’s invasion was likely to push inflation higher and could propel declines in financial risk-taking that could reduce new investment. US inflation currently stands at 7.5% in February — a 40-year high and far above the central bank’s target of 2%. But those future concerns are weighed against the current picture of strong employment gains that are more than three times the average monthly increase of jobs in 2019 before the pandemic sent many workers home with a loss of 22m jobs in the spring of 2020. A survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that Americans are now much less worried about the pandemic than they were in January or December, and most restrictions and mask mandates are rapidly being lifted as workers return to offices. According the bureau, employment in the low-paid leisure and hospitality sector showed the strongest gains, with an increase of 179,000 jobs in February. But overall, the sector is still down by 1.5m, or 9.0%, from February 2020. However, employment in professional and business services is 596,000 higher than at that time. Wage growth pressure appeared to be subsiding, economists said, with average hourly earning increases dropping to 5.1% from 5.7% on a annualized basis. “While that might seem at odds with the falling unemployment rate, the job openings and quits rates and broader survey evidence have suggested labor shortages are leveling off a bit, which is consistent with pay growth stabilizing,” said Capital Economics’ Pearce.",News/US news,"US jobs numbers beat predictions, with 200,000 new jobs added in February",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/us-jobs-report-february-analysis
3/5/2022,"As the UK government seeks ways to take on Russian oligarchs with links to Vladimir Putin’s regime, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has asked government lawyers to “find literally any way” to crack down on “Slapps” – or strategic lawsuits against public participation – where the wealthy exploit lengthy and expensive legal procedures to silence journalists, critics and watchdogs. While Slapps generally arise out of defamation lawsuits and ostensibly have the same purpose – of protecting the claimant’s reputation – they are seen as an attempt to shut down public criticism, with the claimant often indifferent about whether they actually win the case. The fear is that they discourage investigative reporting into rich and powerful people because of the potential costs of defending a claim, even if it has little or no merit. In a parliamentary debate on Slapps in January, David Davis, a Conservative MP and former cabinet minister, said “nefarious” actors were using the justice system “to threaten, intimidate and put the fear of God into British journalists, citizens, officials and media organisations”. He described such tactics as “lawfare”. The Foreign Policy Centre said the UK was “the most frequent country of origin” for foreign legal threats against investigative journalists. The use of Slapps is not confined to Russians but one of the most notorious recent examples, characterised as such by MPs as well as free speech campaigners, related to Putin’s People, a book written by the journalist Catherine Belton about the Russian leader. She and her publisher HarperCollins were sued over a number of matters in the book by multiple Russian billionaires, including Roman Abramovich, who owns Chelsea football club, Mikhail Fridman, the owner of Russia’s largest non-state bank, and also the Russian state oil company Rosneft. All of the claims were subsequently settled or withdrawn. Abramovich ended his case after HarperCollins accepted some information concerning him was inaccurate and agreed to make revisions to the book. HarperCollins apologised and agreed to make a payment to charity in recognition of a particular error, but otherwise no damages were paid and both sides agreed to pay their own costs. Many US states, as well as some Canadian provinces, have brought in anti-Slapp laws. They are not all the same but typically involve the publisher being able to apply to the court at an early stage for a lawsuit to be dismissed if it relates to content that is in the public interest. In an interview with the Guardian, the leading media defence lawyer, Caroline Kean, proposed that the publisher should not even have to make an application, which could be costly in itself, but the judge should automatically decide at the outset of each case whether it relates to public interest journalism and if so it should be halted and resolved by granting a prominent right to reply. In the parliamentary debate, another Tory MP, Bob Seely, suggested the government should “go after” law firms who lodged Slapps on behalf of clients, although he did not specify how this should be done.",News/Law,"What are Slapps, and how are they connected to Russian oligarchs?",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/04/what-are-slapps-and-how-are-they-connected-to-russian-oligarchs
3/5/2022,"It was a moment of pure joy at a Paris fashion week sobered by the shadow of war. Rihanna sailed into the Dior show like a galleon in full sail, pregnancy bump lightly veiled in a sheer black negligee of lace-trimmed dotted Swiss tulle. The veteran fashion critic Tim Blanks, who quizzed the pop star backstage as to whether she was expecting a boy or a girl – she wasn’t telling – described her as “the most radiant expectant mother … a real ray of light on a dark joy.”In the month since the unofficial new “Queen of Barbados” announced her pregnancy by posing for the paparazzi photographer Miles Diggs on a snowy New York street with a vintage Chanel pink coat unbuttoned to reveal a naked bump crowned with a cascade of gold and gemstone jewellery, Rihanna has done more than push the boundaries of maternity wear. In characteristic form, she is challenging expectations of how women in the public eye should look and behave.Rihanna, who wore a fluffy lavender coat over a black latex crop top at Gucci and a peach leather mini dress for the Off-White show, has not been the only expectant mother in the spotlight at this month of fashion shows. At the young designer Nensi Dojaka’s London fashion week show, the tissue-thin sequined slip worn by the model Maggie Maurer celebrated her four-month pregnant shape. “I think it’s quite shocking – in a good way,” Maurer told Vogue. “Women’s bodies are like superpowers.”In the age of optics, announcing a pregnancy via the medium of fashion has established itself as a power move. A timeline shift toward ever more daring takes on bump-dressing can be tracked via the maternity fashion of a thought leader in this field, Beyoncé. When Beyoncé revealed her first pregnancy in 2011 at the MTV Video Music Awards during her performance of Love on Top – by unbuttoning her sequined blazer and turning to give the audience a profile view – the bump was demurely covered-up in a white shirt and high-waisted trousers. By the time Beyoncé was pregnant with twins in 2017, the rules of engagement had altered. This time around, Beyoncé made the reveal wearing only a bra and satin knickers, cradling her bump in front of a flower arbour with a veil falling over her shoulders as softly as the hair of Botticelli’s Venus, in an image which set a new record for Instagram likes. Last year, Cardi B leaned into the performative, bespoke-outfitted pregnancy reveal while on stage at the BET awards, in a black bodysuit which was barnacled all over with rhinestones, except for a porthole-shaped window of sheer black mesh which framed her swelling tummy.Rihanna is highly strategic about which elements of her private life she shares – she lived in London for a full year without alerting the paparazzi to the fact until an eagle-eyed fan spotted a Sainsbury’s Bag for Life in the background of one of her social media posts – and the high-visibility wardrobing of her pregnancy is deliberate. “I’m really pushing into the idea of sexy,” she told the Refinery29 website. “When you get pregnant, society tends to make it feel like you hide […] your sexy and that you’re not sexy right now [but] you’ll get back there and I don’t believe in that shit.”The new hot take on maternity wear is a refreshing inversion of popular culture’s obsession with narrow female bodies. Glorifying a woman’s body during the months when it is gets bigger broadens the Overton window around which female bodies are considered aspirational and worthy of celebration. Wearing sheer lingerie and black patent spike heels while pregnant bumps up against ingrained expectations not just about what women wear, but about how they should behave. Traditionally, maternity wear has regressed the wardrobe of grown women into childlike pastels and twee Peter Pan collars, as if to suggest that expectant mothers should be seen and not heard. When a heckler berated Rihanna for holding up Dior’s show this week, repeatedly shouting “You’re late” as the star was ushered to her front row seat, an unhurried Rihanna shot an unsmiling glance over her shoulder and deadpanned: “No shit.”",Arts/Music,‘A radiant expectant mother’: Rihanna and the rise of the power bump,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/04/rihanna-and-the-rise-of-the-power-bump-pregnancy
3/5/2022,"Happiness lies in ruins. This small town – Schastia in Ukrainian – has been out of the headlines since Moscow took its brutal war against civilians to the country’s biggest cities. But it is here, and in nearby Volnovakha, that the illegal tactics of terrorising civilians for military aims, honed in Syria and then brought back so close to home, have reached a grim apotheosis. There have been terrible strikes on homes, schools and hospitals around Ukraine. But residents of both towns say the barrage of shelling, rocket assaults and air strikes since the start of the war has damaged or destroyed nearly every building in their towns, a comprehensive devastation as yet unmatched elsewhere. The Russian flag has now been raised over the ruins of Schastia. In Volnovakha, the attack is still so intense that dead bodies lie uncollected, says local MP Dmytro Lubinets. Ukrainians still brave enough to run rescue missions are going back only for the living. Thousands of them are trapped in basements, with dwindling supplies of food and water, sheltering from an apparently senseless attack on a town Lubinets says has no military defenders in its centre. The line of contact is 20km away, he says. “It never stops, every five minutes there is a mortar landing or artillery shells, some buildings have been hit by multiple rocket systems,” he said by phone. “In the city there is not any building which has not suffered from direct or collateral damage. So some buildings have major destruction, some minor destruction, some are completely destroyed to the ground.” On Friday morning, Ukrainian media claimed that a Russian war plane bombing “residential areas and civilian infrastructure” in the area was shot down. Pavlo*, a Schastia native who evacuated his family, said 80% of the town was damaged in an intense bombardment that lasted days, and as in Volnovakha, barely any buildings were entirely untouched. “People started evacuation after three days, when Russian forces stopped bombing the town and people could leave the shelters,” he said. “People didn’t have water, gas, electricity for three or four days because of the bombing. They used all kinds of their weapons, Grad rockets, artillery and mines.” The devastation in larger cities like Chernihiv and Kharkiv is deadly and terrible, but has still affected only a relatively small portion of the towns, even if the terror it instils casts a shadow over every civilian still trapped there. But what Russian forces appear to show in these smaller towns is that they are willing to leave behind them a wasteland on a massive scale, as they did in Grozhny in Chechnia, or – together with Syrian forces – in the ancient city of Aleppo. Neither humanity nor heritage stopped them. Attacking civilians, and the infrastructure that supports life including hospitals and schools, is illegal under international law. It has no direct strategic advantage for an advancing army. But it is extremely effective at breaking morale of a resisting population. The “I love Volnovakha” sign in the centre of town, which has survived somehow, has a backdrop of ruined houses. It appears at the start of a video, filmed from a moving car, which captures crumpled shops, buildings blackened by fire, and a road strewn with debris. Before the war, the population of the town was 25,000. Lubinets says at least 3,000 people are trapped, but possibly many more. Hundreds of them are children. Requests for a humanitarian evacuation corridor have gone unanswered, so the military and other volunteers are risking their lives to bring people out in small groups. “We drive under fire to the places where people mostly concentrated, schools, hospitals, grab them out, put them in the car and bring them out, because the shelling never stops at any second,” he said. “Its impossible to use buses because they have low mobility. Always when you go there you will get punctures, so you just have to drive [the car] out for about 10 minutes to places where big buses can come.” For many residents of these towns, their lives are as irreparably shattered as their homes, barely a week into this war. Their suffering may be a terrible template for the damage Russia will inflict on others, if Moscow tries to pound bigger towns and cities into submission. “There was life before, and life after, and now I just feel emptiness inside,” said Iyrna*, who fled in a long, lonely journey through a succession of towns and cities under attack – first Chernihiv, then Kyiv and finally to relative safety in the western city of Lviv. “Nobody knows what is going on there.” “A friend [still in Schastia] told me: ‘I can’t even go to your place to try and collect some papers, or other things, everything there is totally smashed up,’” she said. “Ninety per cent of houses are damaged.” She was just out of hospital after major surgery when the war began, and her husband is serving on the frontline. “For three days I was in such deep stress I couldn’t eat or drink, even now they have been swept out of my memory. I was so exhausted I had hallucinations that my husband was with me.” Shastia and Volnovakha were on the frontline for eight years of the smaller-scale war between Ukrainian forces and Lubinets believes the carnage inflicted on the towns now is revenge for their resilience through those years. “From the very first day of the war they started shelling us directly … They are trying to wipe out the town,” he said. “I think someone in Russia is destroying [the town] as a reminder of what they can do to someone who doesn’t break in the face of Russian aggression.” * Name has been changed to protect family members in areas under Russian control",News/World news,‘Ninety per cent of houses are damaged’: thousands trapped in Ukraine’s small towns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ninety-per-cent-of-houses-are-damaged-thousands-trapped-in-ukraines-small-towns
3/5/2022,"A coroner has described as “woefully inadequate” the information and treatment available for a 24-year-old problem gambler who took his own life in Vietnam. David Urpeth, the Sheffield coroner, on Friday delivered a narrative conclusion into the inquest of Jack Ritchie, a gambling addict who was teaching English in Hanoi. His parents, Charles and Liz Ritchie, had tenaciously fought for an inquest that not only examined their son’s death but also state regulation of the gambling industry. The coroner did not rule that any arm of the state had directly breached any duty to protect Ritchie’s life. But Urpeth said “warnings, information and treatment” for problem gamblers at the time of Ritchie’s death were “woefully inadequate and failed to meet Jack’s needs”. The situation had improved but there was still “significantly more” that needed to be done. He said he would write to government departments and gambling agencies with warnings about how future deaths could be prevented. He highlighted the need for more training for GPs about gambling disorders. Afterwards, Liz Ritchie told the Guardian it was “an extraordinary, seismic ruling”. She described the future death notices as “really clear instructions to government to do things better”. “[The coroner] found multiple state failings in regard to gambling in terms of regulation, treatment and information.” Those failings, she said, “killed Jack, they caused his death. So it was a huge ruling.” The inquest heard evidence that as many as 400 suicides a year in England could be linked directly to gambling. Charles Ritchie said the prevention of future death orders issued by the coroner were beyond what they could have hoped for. “Jack died four and a half years ago so it has been a long, long journey and to get that as a set of rulings is extraordinary.” Speaking on the steps of Sheffield town hall the couple said: “For us, this inquest has been about justice for Jack. Jack died believing he was the problem and he was harming us and his family. This is not true and the coroner found explicitly that it was not Jack’s fault. “Jack was abused by parasites who inflict life-threatening illness for profit and then blame the victims. “Jack’s inquest revealed that the link between gambling and suicide has been known for years but it’s taken the deaths of thousands to start to make proper change.” The Ritchie family argued that gambling killed their son. “It was the long-term root and the short-term trigger of Jack’s death,” they said. Urpeth suggested that was a step too far. Instead, he said it was “abundantly clear” that gambling contributed to Ritchie’s death. The coroner praised Ritchie’s parents and said they had done all they could to help their son. It is believed to be the first time article 2 of the Human Rights Act has been engaged in a case relating to suicide after gambling. That meant its scope included examining whether any arm of the state breached its duty to protect Ritchie’s right to life. Engaging article 2 had been opposed by lawyers representing the government. Ritchie’s gambling problem began when he was a sixth-former at school, betting small stakes at a betting shop on controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs). It escalated over time, with Ritchie gambling away money left to him by his grandmother, his student loan while studying history at Hull University and, while he was in Vietnam, his overdraft. Jack’s parents set up a charity, Gambling With Lives, to support affected families and raise awareness of the dangers gambling brings. The campaign says “very normal, bright, popular and happy young folk” are killing themselves and “gambling was their only problem”. Ritchie was described by his father as “big in physique and in personality … big in heart and in spirit”. Witnesses at the inquest included Jonathan Marron, a senior civil servant at the Department of Health and Social Care, who said: “I don’t think there’s any dispute that there’s an association between gambling and suicide.” As his session finished, Marron, the director general for the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, choked back tears as he acknowledged the trauma Jack’s parents had been through. He was the father of a teenage daughter, he said. “It’s clear that the work you have done has had a significant role in changing the focus of this issue.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/5/2022,"In our age of inclusion, is holding two separate events – the Olympics and the Paralympics – outdated? Could combining them give world-class Paralympians the widespread exposure they deserve? I spoke to Ellie Robinson, Team GB Paralympic swimmer and one of the presenting team for the Paralympic Games on Channel 4. Hi Ellie! How’s today going?Today’s been fun – I was on Lorraine earlier! But I had an assignment due yesterday as I’m still in university. That blows my mind. Both Games are just ordinary people doing extraordinary things. So why not put them in the same competition?I’m all for integration, rather than segregation, but logistically it’s too challenging. The competition would need to be a month long. And can you imagine the size of the Olympic village? But there must be an audience for it. Nearly 3m tickets were sold for the London 2012 Paralympics, and more than 11 million people watched the broadcast of the opening ceremony, making it one of the most successful ever. That’s something to be proud of.London woke everybody else up, showing that the Paralympic Games are a very credible sporting competition. It was sports first, disability second. It showed people the level of competition, the rivalries; it became an elite sporting competition, not just the one that goes after the Olympics. I went to the 2012 Paralympics and the atmosphere was incredible. Although the race I saw was won by Oscar Pistorius, which leaves a strange taste.I wasn’t in London 2012, but some of the British athletes were talking about it in Rio. They were like: “What the hell?” What about scheduling the Paralympics before the Olympics?I’m not so sure. Selfishly, with the Olympics before, it’s almost like a testing ground. So if anything goes wrong, it’s sorted out by the Paralympics. From an optimising-performance and logistical point of view, it’s quite nice going second. I’m still interested in this idea of one Games. Before the Paralympics were created in 1960 – and even since – there have been disabled athletes in Olympic teams, like New Zealand archer Neroli Fairhall who competed in a wheelchair. Though, admittedly, with the dedicated games we see far more Paralympians …I like the idea that we’re all competing for the same nation, too. I think the more categories you start putting people in, not just in sport but in life, the less progress you’re making. And some nations focus all their funding on able-bodied athletes and don’t bring any Paralympic athletes, because the Olympics does get more exposure. So it would be interesting to see if that changed if we combined it. The Commonwealth Games is a good example of what it could be, as it is combined. But it doesn’t include as many events for para-athletes. OK, Ellie, I think you’ve answered all my questions. Best of luck with your presenting debut!Thanks – I’m excited! Denise Lewis told me that your first Paralympics or Olympics on the commentary side is hell, because you’re watching everybody compete and you’re not. But I think I have come to the end of my athlete chapter. And there’s no pressure on me; no consequences if I don’t perform well. I don’t have to worry about how well my hip holds out. It’s the most relaxed I’ve ever been going into the Games and I’m loving it.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Should the Paralympics and Olympics unite?

It’s a pudding that’s all about contrasting textures: a crisp, crunchy shell, meringue-like marshmallow, a soft, buttery cake and billowy cream to sandwich it all together. The tarragon imparts a lovely aniseed flavour, cutting through the sweetness and making this playful cake feel a little more grown-up.

Add the butter and beat until pale and creamy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating well after each one. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, ground almonds, baking powder and salt. Pour half of this into the butter mixture, mix briefly and then stir in the milk. Mix in the rest of the flour before dividing the mixture evenly between the tins. Put the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk on high speed until stiff peaks form. Add the sugar a tablespoon at a time. Once all the sugar has been added, the meringue should be thick and glossy. Whisk in the cornflour. Spoon the meringue on top of one cake, top with flaked almonds and bake both cakes for 25-30 minutes. Once the cake without meringue is baked all the way through, remove from the oven and continue to bake the meringue layer for 20 minutes, until it is lightly browned and feels crisp when touched. Leave to cool completely. To make the syrup, heat the sugar, lemon juice and tarragon sprigs in a small saucepan and bring to the boil. Simmer for a minute before removing from the heat.

3/5/2022,"Russian troops have seized Europe’s largest nuclear plant at Zaporizhzhia after a fire sparked by heavy shelling, Ukrainian authorities said. No changes in radiation had been recorded but any loss of ability to cool nuclear fuel would lead to “significant radioactive emissions” that could “outgrow all previous nuclear power plant accidents”, they said. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Mariano Grossi, offered to travel to Ukraine to facilitate talks with Russia aimed at guaranteeing the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. The situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” he said. Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg has warned the days to come are “likely to be worse”, calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the worst military aggression in Europe for decades”. But he stressed Nato was a “defensive alliance” and not seeking a war with Russia. Stoltenberg said foreign ministers discussed a “no-fly zone” over Ukraine but agreed that Nato planes should not operate over Ukrainian airspace. He also said Nato had evidence Russia was using cluster bombs. The UN security council will hold an emergency meeting later on Friday following Russia’s attack on the Zaporizhzhia plant, diplomats said. More than 1.2m people have fled Ukraine into neighbouring countries since Russia launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February, the UN said, including about half a million children. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed directly to Russians to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible?” he said. “After all, we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry strongly condemned the shelling of the nuclear plant and called for the international community to force Russia to withdraw. Zelenskiy earlier accused Russia of “nuclear terror”, as British PM Boris Johnson said Putin’s forces were “reckless”. The blaze has sparked deep concern over the fate of Ukraine’s nuclear plants amid the worsening fighting. US president Joe Biden and Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau also condemned Russia for shelling the plant and starting the blaze, which took hold in a training building on the site’s perimeter. Russia’s defence ministry blamed the attack on the nuclear plant on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a “monstrous provocation”. Vladimir Putin warned Russia’s neighbours “not to escalate the situation” by imposing more restrictions on his country, adding: “There are no bad intentions towards our neighbours … We fulfil all our obligations and will continue to fulfil them.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russians to rally around their president and said that what happened next would depend on Kyiv’s stance in talks, adding that Russia had “clearly conveyed to the Ukrainian side our vision of solving this problem”. Ukraine and Russia agreed to try to create humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians in a second round of talks on Thursday. A third round is set to take place next week. Ukraine’s culture minister called for the skies to be closed over Ukraine because Russian forces are “destroying cultural sites”. Oleksandr Tkachenko said most of Putin’s “war crimes” had been “committed from the air” and were “deliberately destroying” the historic centres of big cities. The UN Human Rights Council overwhelmingly voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with 32 members of the 47-seat council in favour and only Russia and Eritrea voting against. The death toll from Russian airstrikes in a residential district of the city of Chernihiv rose to 47, regional authorities said. Rescue work had to be suspended due to heavy shelling, according to the local emergency services. Russia’s parliament passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” information about the armed forces.

3/5/2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. Petro Kotin, the acting president of the state-run nuclear power corporation, Energoatom, said workers had been allowed by Russian forces to go back to their posts at the nuclear plant, but had been working “under the barrels of machine guns” and they were “physically and mentally exhausted”. The Ukrainian state inspectorate for nuclear regulation said in a statement on its Facebook page the plant had been “captured by the military forces of the Russian Federation”. “Changes in the radiation state for the current time have not been recorded,” the statement said, adding that power units two and three had been disconnected from the network and nuclear installations were being cooled down. But it warned that any “loss of the possibility to cool down nuclear fuel will lead to significant radioactive releases into the environment” that could “exceed all previous accidents at nuclear power plants, including the Chornobyl accident and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant”. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it had been informed that “a projectile overnight had hit a training building in the vicinity of one of the plant’s reactor units, causing a localized fire that was later extinguished”. Kotin said Russian forces had broken through a Ukrainian barricade on Thursday night with 100 armoured vehicles, and had begun shelling the plant. He said they targeted administrative buildings and the checkpoint at the entrance until they won control of the site. “As of 9am on 4 March, the station staff were allowed to work, but had been working at the site for almost a day already, so they were physically and mentally exhausted. It is necessary that another shift comes to work,” Kotin said on Energoatom’s Telegram channel. “The management of the station have been under the barrels of machine guns.” He claimed there were “dead and injured”, and the IAEA reported that two people had been wounded. The IAEA confirmed there had been no release of radiation but he added: “The operator has reported that the situation remains very challenging and therefore it has not yet been possible to access the whole site to assess that all safety systems are fully functional.” The agency said that, of the plant’s six reactors, one had been shut down for maintenance, two had undergone a controlled shut down, two were being held ‘in reserve” in lower power mode, and one was operating at 60% power. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the IAEA director general, said he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate talks between Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict, including how to ensure the physical integrity of sites, maintaining power, safety monitoring systems and full staffing, he said. Both sides were considering the proposal. “The situation continues to be extremely tense and challenging,” Grossi said. “The physical integrity of the plant has been compromised with what happened last night. We are fortunate that there was no release of radiation and the integrity of the reactors themselves were not compromised.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed directly to Russian citizens on Friday to stage protests over the seizure of nuclear power infrastructure by Russian troops in Ukraine. “Russian people, I want to appeal to you: how is this possible? After all, we fought together in 1986 against the Chernobyl catastrophe,” he said in a televised address. Russia’s defence ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a monstrous provocation. Zelenskiy said earlier on Friday while the fire was still blazing that Europe “must wake up now. The largest nuclear station in Europe is on fire. Right now, Russian tanks are shelling nuclear units. Those are the tank that have thermal vision, so they know where they are shelling.” “If there will be an explosion, it will be the end to all of us: the end of Europe, the evacuation of Europe,” Zelenskiy added. “Only immediate action of Europe can stop Russian troops and prevent the death of Europe from the disaster at a nuclear station.” He accused Russia of resorting to “nuclear terror”. “No country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units,” he said. “This is the first time in our history, in the history of mankind, the terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.” At about 6am on Friday, Ukraine time emergency services said the fire in the training building had been “localised”. The fire was extinguished shortly later, and there were no injuries among the plant staff, the emergency services said. Joe Biden called the Ukrainian president at about 3.40am Kyiv time. According to the White House, Zelenskiy updated the US president on the incident and the two leaders urged Russia “to cease its military activities in the area and allow firefighters and emergency responders to access the site”. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, also spoke to Zelenskiy after news of the fire broke. A Downing Street spokesperson called the situation “gravely concerning”, adding: “The prime minister said the reckless actions of President Putin could now directly threaten the safety of all of Europe. He said the UK would do everything it could to ensure the situation did not deteriorate further. “The prime minister said he would be seeking an emergency UN Security Council meeting in the coming hours, and that the UK would raise this issue immediately with Russia and close partners. Both leaders agreed a ceasefire was crucial.” The confinement chambers of a nuclear reactor are built to withstand heavy impact and even bombing, while the VVER pressurised water reactor itself is designed to shut down in an emergency. VVER reactors are considered much safer than the type of reactor that blew up in Chernobyl in 1986, for example. The Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine – which houses six of the country’s 15 nuclear reactors – as well as the neighbouring town of Energodar, have been surrounded by Russian troops since the beginning of the week. Crowds of local people had stood in the road leading up to the plant, forming a human barrier to the invading force. Mariana Budjeryn, a Ukrainian expert at the project on managing the atom at Harvard University’s Belfer Center, said the most vulnerable part of a nuclear plant was the power and water supply. “If the electricity is taken out, the back-up generators kick in, but if those don’t kick in or their diesel fuel is set on fire, for example, the pumps can’t pump cold water into the reactor and into the spent fuel pools. That’s necessary to keep the nuclear reaction moderated. Otherwise the water will boil out and the core will go critical and explode.” She said confinement chambers were designed to withstand some level of impact and could stop the release of radiation even if the core exploded. She warned, however, that the pools holding spent fuel rods could be more of a worry. “The fuel there is not as active, but they are usually overstuffed,” Budjeryn said. Less active but more tightly packed material was also dangerous if the cooling system were to fail, she said. “And spent fuel pools are not covered by hardened concrete confinement chambers,” Budjeryn added.",News/World news,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant seized by Russians after shelling, say authorities",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/ukraine-nuclear-power-plant-fire-zaporizhzhia-russian-shelling
3/5/2022,"Keir Starmer has called on the Conservatives to sack their co-chair, Ben Elliot, for being “at the heart” of links between the party and Russian money. The Labour leader said Elliot should step back from his role or be removed after revelations about his firm’s Russian business and the Tories accepting donations from wealthy Russians or companies linked to Russia. Elliot has been chair of the party while it has taken donations from Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Putin’s former finance minister, and Aquind, a company co-owned by the billionaire Viktor Fedotov. Neither is subject to any sanctions and the Conservatives have previously said in relation to Chernukhin and Aquind that all donations were “properly and transparently” declared in line with electoral law. Chernukhin, who has British citizenship, has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called Putin’s regime “despotic”. Elliot is also co-owner of Quintessentially, a “concierge” service for the super-wealthy that has counted many Russians among its clients, including reportedly Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea owner who has also faced calls from Starmer for UK sanctions to be imposed on him. Quintessentially this week deleted a webpage detailing its presence in Russia, with about 50 staff in the country. An archived page version said: “Quintessentially Russia has nearly 15 years’ experience providing luxury lifestyle management services to Russia’s elite and corporate members. Our office employs over 50 lifestyle managers, each of whom has completed a specialised training programme. They work around the clock 365 days per year to provide personal concierge services to each member. From restaurant bookings to backstage concert access, a bespoke luxury lifestyle is at our clients’ fingertips.” A spokesperson for Quintessentially said the group “completely condemns President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine” and was monitoring its member base to ensure it was not servicing any individual or corporate body on sanctions lists, confirming that there were none so far. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. With concerns heightened after the invasion of Ukraine, Starmer said it was time for the Conservatives to act to remove Elliot. Speaking during a visit to Birmingham Erdington, where Labour won a byelection on Thursday, Starmer said: “I think there is growing concern about the links between the Conservative party and Russian money. Ben Elliot is at the heart of that. We need to strip Russian money away from our politics, not to allow it to influence our politics. “There will always be this danger if the Conservative government doesn’t go really hard on this that people will say it must be because you are reliant on Russian money that you are not going more quickly. “So, it’s in everybody’s best interests that Ben Elliot steps back from his role – and I think he should actually be sacked from it.” The Conservative party has been approached for comment.

3/5/2022,"Premier League matches will be blocked by Chinese broadcasters this weekend because of planned displays of solidarity with Ukraine. Under the banner “Football Stands Together”, club captains will wear armbands in the colours of Ukraine this weekend and a “moment of reflection and solidarity” will take place before kick-off. The gestures of solidarity are to feature in international broadcast feeds of all Premier League fixtures, and the league’s Chinese broadcast partner, IQIYI Sports, has informed the league that matches will not be broadcast in the country as a result. This is not the first occasion that Chinese broadcasters have blocked the Premier League. In 2019 a match involving Arsenal was pulled from the schedules after the club’s then captain, Mesut Özil, criticised Chinese treatment of Uyghur Muslims. In 2020 Bloomberg also reported that the state terrestrial broadcaster, CCTV, had demoted English top-flight matches to less popular channels after the UK government’s decision to ban the Chinese company Huawei from its 5G network. CCTV is understood not to have renewed a terrestrial deal with the Premier League in the current period. The League engaged in a protracted league battle with PPTV, its former broadcast partner in the country, after the company defaulted on its contract during the pandemic. The high court ruled that PPTV should pay the Premier League £156m in compensation, but the Guardian understands that money has yet to be paid. IQIYI agreed a three-year deal for exclusive Premier League rights. Although the value of the deal was not disclosed it was believed to be significantly lower than that agreed with PPTV. On Thursday the league’s chief executive, Richard Masters, confirmed that it was re-evaluating its broadcast contracts in Russia. “It’s clearly under review”, he said. “I would like the Russian people to see the strength of feeling. We will look at it very closely re suspension and termination. We are looking at it right now.”",Sport/Football,China pulls Premier League TV coverage over shows of solidarity with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/china-pulls-premier-league-tv-coverage-over-shows-of-solidarity-with-ukraine

3/5/2022,"The west has broadened its sanctions against politicians, businesses and individuals with links to Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine. However, the EU has accused the UK government – which has a list of more than 100 Russian oligarchs facing sanctions over the coming weeks – of lagging behind in taking action. The UK government said it had sanctioned 13 leading oligarchs since the invasion began, and there were now 15 on the sanctions list with one of them, Mikhail Gutseriev, sanctioned under the Belarus sanctions regime. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is expected to launch an oligarch taskforce “to target Russian elite” next week. The latest penalties that have been imposed on Russia-linked businesspeople include asset freezes, travel bans and a ban on commercial transactions. Here are some of the prominent business figures who have been sanctioned by the UK, US and EU so far. Denis BortnikovThe deputy president of state-owned VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, he is the son of Alexander Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the KGB. Petr FradkovThe chair and chief executive of Promsvyazbank is also the son of Mikhail Fradkov, a former prime minister of Russia and former director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Elena GeorgievaThe chair of Novikombank, a subsidiary of the major Russian state-backed defence business Rostec. Boris RotenbergA co-owner of SMP Bank, which is linked to the energy firm Gazprom, he is described as having “close personal ties” to Putin, a friend since childhood when they trained in judo together. Igor RotenbergA nephew of Boris who also has close ties to Putin. He controls transport businesses and has also been linked to Gazprom. Kirill ShamalovAt 39 he is Russia’s youngest billionaire and Putin’s former son-in-law. The son of Nikolai Shamalov, a major shareholder in Rossiya bank, he made his money from petrochemicals is a shareholder and director of the petrochemical firm Sibur. Igor ShuvalovOne of Russia’s leading oligarchs, he has significant UK interests including two luxury apartments in central London worth an estimated £11m. He is head of Vnesheconombank, which has been a key source of funding for Kremlin priorities. He faces a full asset freeze and travel ban and no British citizen or business can deal with him. Yuri SlyusarThe head of United Aircraft Corporation, a major supplier to Russia’s military and a key figure in its defence sector. Gennady TimchenkoThe 69-year-old billionaire friend of Putin owns the private investment firm Volga Group, which has holdings in energy, transport, infrastructure and financial services. Alisher UsmanovA leading Russian oligarch, he has had significant interests in English football clubs – in 2018 he sold his stake in Arsenal, while on Wednesday Everton moved to suspend all sponsorship deals with his USM Holdings company. Usmanov owns a lavish property portfolio in the UK, is a shareholder in iron ore and steel group Metalloinvest, and also operates in the media and internet sectors. Vladimir BogdanovThe director general and vice-chair of the board of directors at Surgutneftegas, an oil company operating in Russia. He has been subject to UK sanctions since 2018. Oleg DeripaskaThe founder of Basic Element, one of Russia’s largest industrial groups, he has also been subject to US sanctions since 2018, a move he has taken legal action to challenge. He was the president of the Russian energy company EN+ Group and until 2018 headed United Company RUSAL, the second-largest aluminium company in the world.

3/5/2022,"Sainsbury’s is renaming its chicken kiev to chicken kyiv and pulling a Russian-made vodka from its shelves in the latest action by a British retailer to signal solidarity with the people of Ukraine. The UK’s second-biggest supermarket said the packaging for the poultry dish would change in the next few weeks, switching the Soviet-era name for the country’s capital for the Ukrainian one. The move comes after several smaller operators announced a switch to chicken kyiv, including the Better Naked brand and Essex-based Our Local Butcher. Marks & Spencer, which popularised the dish in the UK after making chicken kiev one of the first ready meals in 1979, has also come under pressure to rename the dish. A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s said: “We stand united with the people of Ukraine. We have reviewed our product range and have decided to remove from sale all products that are 100% sourced from Russia. “This means that from today we will no longer sell two products – Russian standard vodka and Karpayskiye black sunflower seeds.” Sainsbury’s said it had also reviewed JJ Whitley products, a range of vodkas and other spirits made in Russia. It said those would continue to be sold in its supermarkets as the drinks company had said it was moving all production to Chorley in Lancashire by the end of this month. Sainsbury’s action comes after the Co-op and Morrisons also removed Russian vodka from sale. Carmen Bryan, the consumer analyst at GlobalData, said: “Governments have been implementing sanctions however, it is interesting to see similar moves from the wider public and independent businesses. “GlobalData’s survey reveals that brand loyalty is heavily influenced by alignment to one’s values. This puts Russian vodka brands in a precarious position, as prolonged conflict will not only damage immediate sales, but may also cause permanent disillusionment against Russian commodities in the long-term.” The removal of Russian vodka from supermarket shelves comes after M&S suspended shipments to its franchisee’s business in Russia on Thursday. It joined a rush of western firms halting operations in Russia, including Swedish furnishings retailer Ikea, which announced it had temporarily closed all stores and factories across the country in a move affecting 15,000 workers. On Friday JD Sports, which sells to Russia via its website, said it was joining British online retailers Boohoo and Asos in suspending sales in the country.",News/Business,Sainsbury’s renames chicken kievs and pulls Russian-made vodka,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/04/sainsburys-renames-chicken-kievs-kyivrussian-made-vodka-uk-supermarket-soviet-spelling-ukraine

3/5/2022,"What will be generation Z’s mark on the world? It’s a question that brims with possibility, and one that ultimately presents hope: this generation is, on the whole, both more politically active and more likely to oppose bigotry towards minorities than their forebears. Gen Z includes some 12 million Brits, but they remain largely absent from traditional journalism: the average age of a UK journalist is between 40 and 45 (pdf). Though new media platforms have enabled more young people than ever before to have a voice, there’s no escaping the fact that the old guard is yet to fully welcome this rapidly maturing age group into the fold. One brand that is giving young voices a platform to be heard is the Co-op. The company is one of three funders of the Peer Action Collective [PAC], a network of young people across the UK who design and conduct research to learn about young people’s experiences of violence, creating opportunities for young people to make their communities safer. Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op says: “Through our relationship with PAC we are helping develop the next generation of Co-operators. A Co-operator is someone who actively has a voice and participates, who works together with others to make a difference in their communities and who strives to create a fairer future. That’s exactly what the young people of PAC are doing. They are listening to their peers in the largest peer-research project ever undertaken on youth violence. They are then taking action to make their communities safer and fairer. “Co-op is already known for its campaigning work for safety of retail colleagues, in this project we also look at young people, their experience of violence and how listening to their voices through the PAC research will enable Co-op and its members and customer to work with them to help make their communities safer fairer places to be. It’s our vision of Co-operating for a fairer world in action.” That commitment to empowering people to make a difference to their communities is reflected across Co-op as a whole. Colleagues of all ages are encouraged to support local communities to improve access to food, mental wellbeing and opportunities for young people. In partnership with the Co-op, the Guardian Labs has mentored and commissioned two PAC peer researchers and a Co-op store colleague, providing a platform for them to share their ideas and experiences, and show readers how they are making an impact on their communities. “For young people to be given a platform like this is invaluable,” says Steve Murrells, Co-op CEO. “It puts them front and centre – providing a great opportunity for fresh and unique perspectives on issues that can often go unnoticed. Mentoring is a great way for young people to take an opportunity and run with it to build up their skills and experience. And doing this in the field of journalism is fantastic, as it provides an opportunity for young voices to be heard through their work.” The three mentees’ articles are available to read now on the Guardian Labs website.

3/5/2022,"Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was seized by Russian military forces, according to regional authorities, after a fire sparked by overnight shelling burned for several hours at the largest facility of its kind in Europe. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency said there had been no release of radiation. The death toll from Russian airstrikes in a residential district of the northern city of Chernihiv rose to 47, regional authorities said. Fire breaks out at the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant: Drone footage shows how explosions destroyed parts of the town of Borodyanka, near Kyiv: A missile appears to hit a residential building in central Chernihiv: Drone shots from Enerhodar in the south of Ukraine: On Thursday 24 February, Russia attacked Ukraine along multiple axes, bringing to a calamitous end weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by western leaders to avert war. Fighting and other military activity took place around and on the way to Kyiv. A substantial attack was aimed at the eastern city of Kharkiv. Russian forces also headed north and east from Crimea. On Friday 25 February, Russian forces reached the outskirts of Kyiv and carried out an amphibious assault from the Sea of Azov near Mariupol. The shape of the Russian incursion became clearer. On Saturday 26 February, Russian forces in control of territory to the north-west of Kyiv continued their assault on the capital. Elsewhere, heavy fighting was reported in and around Kharkiv and there were Ukrainian counterattacks in some places previously claimed by Russian forces. On Monday 28 February, Russian rocket attacks killed dozens of people in Kharkiv. Pre-dawn blasts were heard again in Kyiv and in Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces and under heavy attack. On Tuesday 1 March, Russian forces bombarded the government headquarters in Kharkiv, and the armoured column continued rolling towards the capital. On Wednesday 2 March, Moscow’s forces took the port and train station in the strategically important city of Kherson, on the Black Sea. Russian paratroopers landed in Kharkiv (pictured below) overnight, after several days of fierce bombardment that killed or wounded dozens of civilians. Kyiv came under more heavy shelling as Russian forces stepped up their offensive and moved closer towards the capital in an apparent attempt to encircle it. Mariupol was reportedly surrounded by Russian troops. A week into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on Thursday 3 March, the Black Sea port of Kherson became the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Moscow’s forces. Russian artillery and missiles continued to bombard other big cities, including Kharkiv and Kyiv, where several large explosions were heard overnight. But a long Russian convoy’s advance on the capital was delayed by “staunch Ukrainian resistance, mechanical breakdown and congestion” and it was still more than 19 miles (30km) from the centre of the city, Britain’s defence ministry said. Mariupol city council said Russia was constantly and deliberately shelling critical civilian infrastructure in the southern Ukrainian port, leaving it without water, heating or power, and preventing supplies being brought in or people being evacuated. Residents in Odesa were increasing preparations to defend it against a potential Russian amphibious landing, amid sightings of a convoy of Russian warships. The international criminal court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine after 39 countries formally referred reports of atrocities, the largest referral it had ever received. And more than 1 million people had so far fled Ukraine in the fastest refugee exodus this century, the UN said. Over the past few months Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Vladimir Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and each side has accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
3/5/2022,"To pick this precise moment to give Gavin Williamson a knighthood reveals much about Boris Johnson. Why doesn’t the prime minister just give Gavin a gas field, or a bank, and make him honorary president of British Fencing? No 10 probably felt yesterday was a good day to bury bad news. Instead, there was plenty of fury at the revelation that yet another useless person has been deemed sufficiently useful to Johnson to receive an honour. Sir Gavin joins Lord Lebedev and far too many others. Say hello to the wallygarchy. Given the ever more horrifying events in Ukraine, this local reward for failure can obviously be regarded as a trifle. On the one hand, it doesn’t exactly matter if Gavin Williamson is made a knight of some corner of an irradiated Europe. On the other, it’s telling that exactly at the moment the occupants of Downing Street are trying to reach for moral stature, they remind you just how small they really are. One major lesson of the horrors of the past eight days is that we are in a new era. That new era, for those of us with the immeasurable luxury of not being bombed into it, should involve a taking of stock and a moral reset. Values, standards and principles in liberal democracies matter. Some of ours have been allowed to become rather tattered. For instance, we can and must agree that public service is not merely the gateway to cronyism. We can and must agree that political parties being funded by people whose sources of wealth are shadowy is a dangerous and compromising situation that needs urgent remedy. We can and must consider what it means that we have allowed London to become the global capital of choice for laundering the illicit wealth foreign nationals have siphoned out of their own countries. In short, we can and must be better than we have been in many ways, and fast. Yet knighting Gavin Williamson in the middle of all this suggests we have a way to go. I’m sure some galaxy brain will be on to explain how I’m oversimplifying things, but it does feel like it should have been so much simpler to NOT knight Gavin Williamson. How hard can NOT honouring the worst secretary of state in recent memory really be? It is suspiciously unclear what the man sacked as both defence and education secretary is being honoured for. Services to making Russia go away and shut up? Leaking from a top-level National Security Council meeting and consequently undermining the trust of the intelligence services (denied)? Presiding over an epochal failure of British children, from which significant numbers will never recover educationally or in terms of life chances? Obviously, we know that the Johnson administration never particularly cared about the schoolchildren – Williamson was kept in post despite his catastrophic failings during the first lockdown and the exams fiasco that inevitably unfolded that summer. In the end, everything about the government’s approach to an entire generation of children can be summarised by the fact that they reopened the pubs before they reopened all the schools. Yet Gavin could find focus when he wanted to. When Christian Wakeford crossed the floor to join Labour earlier this year, the Bury South MP claimed that Williamson had threatened to cancel a new school in his constituency if he did not vote against extending free school meals into the holidays for the poorest children – a conversation Williamson apparently does not remember having. It’s hard to believe a government that knows all this and still honours Williamson will do the right thing in other areas. Will they clean up the oligarchs to whom they have hitherto shown such sublime indifference or active encouragement, or will they just say that’s what they’re going to do? They do, after all, say a lot of things. Take the culture secretary. The last time I saw Nadine Dorries cry at work she was sobbing because Boris Johnson had pulled out of his post-referendum leadership bid. Yet here she was on Thursday, turning on the waterworks at the dispatch box, offering the BBC “heartfelt thanks and admiration” for its reporting. Oh Nadine. NOW you’re a fan, is it? Because just weeks ago you were issuing tinpot threats on your Twitter about the BBC as we’ve known it being over. Weirdly, I don’t see Nadine’s precious Netflix dodging the bombs in a Kyiv basement in order to bring the world the news. (I should say that the Beeb is in Kyiv alongside many exceptional journalists from other UK broadcasters – a reminder that the BBC’s unique funding model has always elevated our whole market. Rivals cannot compete for funding, so have traditionally competed on quality. And if you don’t believe it, go and watch a range of American broadcast news for an evening.) Anyway, amazing that it’s taken actual war in Europe to make the actual culture secretary realise that maybe – just maybe! – the enemy is a station like Russia Today and not the BBC. Like I said, maybe Nadine has realised that. Notwithstanding her tears, I don’t buy it myself. The one thing you can be absolutely sure of is that this government will be trying to cripple the BBC again in a few months, because at that point that particular position will suit them better once again. The Johnson administration doesn’t do immutable principles. They only do expedience. In fact, it’s occasionally hard not to see in Dorries a watered-down version of higher skilled monsters such as Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who yesterday claimed the BBC was being used to undermine Russia’s internal politics and security. She should speak to Nadine. I keep hearing from her and half the rest of the cabinet that the BBC undermines the UK’s internal politics. I can never remember exactly why – I think it’s something to do with talent salaries or running stories about the government that they don’t like. Either way, the government now seems to be engaged in a number of hasty pivots. If these are genuine, then good. The time for a “let’s not, and say we did” approach has passed. But on the form book, promises to make the British political family completely legitimate are unconvincing.

3/5/2022,"Imagine the world that Jane Austen creates with her writing. The wit. The romance. The cruelty and complex emotions. The dancing. Then make the dancing very silly indeed. Throw in a few robot moves. Add bubbles. Make those bubbles cascade down from the sky. Chuck in some comedy falls, pounding pop music, cheery singalongs and lots of messy business with some ice-cream sauce. You’re just about there (only add more bubbles). This is a joyfully silly take on Persuasion – with just enough sense (and sensibility) to hold the whole thing together. Everything about director and adapter Jeff James’s audacious production, first performed at the Royal Exchange in 2017, has been amped up to the max. The explosive soundtrack from Ben and Max Ringham plays at full throttle, the wacky dancing is practically an extra character in its own right and the comic performances are full of exuberant and eccentric flourishes. Alex Lowde’s set is, quite literally, a jumping off point for the comedy. A rotating platform edged with neon lights doubles up as a dancefloor, a catwalk (complete with a crackers Kim Kardashian cameo), a foamy ocean and, when Anne’s family members get particularly annoying, a handy ledge off which to shove the offending character. The ensemble cast perform with comic panache, but there are grains of truth beneath all the grandstanding. Matilda Bailes is exceptional in her stage debut and doubles as both Anne’s spoilt sister Elizabeth and love rival Louise Musgrove. Bailes expresses herself as much through barmy dancing as with words, but there’s an increasing desperation to these frantic displays that hint, with both characters, at a deep fear of winding up alone. Helen Cripps and Dorian Simpson play sniping married couple, Mary and Charles, who raise a lot of laughs – but also serve as a constant reminder of the very real possibility of an unhappy ending. Sasha Frost’s Anne is thoughtful and compassionate but also stroppy, impulsive and proud. She makes a believable match with Fred Fergus’s diva-ish but ultimately decent Wentworth. Amid all the mayhem there’s still room in this memorable production for messy, grownup, hold-your-heart-and-hope-for-it love.

3/5/2022,"Shane Warne, one of the finest bowlers of all time who revived the art of leg-spin, has died aged 52 after a suspected heart attack. The Australian – a larger-than-life character whose total of 708 Test wickets has been surpassed only by his contemporary rival and fellow spinner Muttiah Muralitharan – could not be revived after being found unresponsive in his Thailand villa. “It is with great sadness we advise that Shane Keith Warne passed away of a suspected heart attack in Koh Samui, Thailand today, Friday 4 March,” a statement from his management company MPC Entertainment read. “Shane was found unresponsive in his villa and despite the best efforts of medical staff, he could not be revived. The family requests privacy at this time and will provide further details in due course.” Warne – who was the joint-leading wicket-taker as Australia won the 1999 World Cup and finished with 293 one-day dismissals in 194 matches – brought an illustrious 15-year international career to an end in 2007. Named in 2000 as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Century, alongside Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Jack Hobbs and Sir Viv Richards, Warne’s impact on the game is immediately apparent. His leg breaks, googlies, flippers and sliders bamboozled many accomplished batters and England were often in his crosshairs. He took 195 wickets at 23.25 with 11 five-fors and four 10-wicket match hauls against the old rivals. But there was also an affinity with England, with Warne representing Hampshire with distinction from 2000 to 2007. While he was celebrated on the field, he and Mark Waugh were fined for accepting money from a bookmaker while he was suspended for 12 months before the start of the 2003 World Cup, after testing positive for a diuretic. However, he established his legacy upon his return, becoming the first bowler to reach 700 Test wickets before bowing out after helping Australia seal a 5-0 Ashes victory in the 2006-07 series. He continued to play on the franchise Twenty20 circuit before retiring from playing altogether in 2013, after which he became well-renowned for his insight and forthright opinion as a commentator and pundit. One of the greatest of all-time.A legend. A genius.You changed Cricket.RIP Shane Warne ❤️ pic.twitter.com/YX91zmssoT After the deaths of Warne and Rod Marsh – who died late on Friday in Adelaide – the Australia opener David Warner tweeted: “Two legends of our game have left us too soon.

3/5/2022,"Lenin, a Russian leader as obsessed with history as Vladimir Putin, famously said: “There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.” This has been the latter. The little more than a week since Russian troops invaded Ukraine has indeed shaken the world. Change has been telescoped, national taboos broken, moribund institutions given purpose and the spectre of a nuclear war in Europe has been raised for the first time since the 1980s. Germany has called it Zeitenwende, the Turning Point. It will not just be Ukraine that is changed for ever by this war. But there is something specific about how war accelerates change. In The Deluge, his classic work on how society is changed by war, the British historian Arthur Marwick wrote: “War acts as a supreme challenge to, and test of, a country’s social and political institutions. War results not only in the destruction of inefficient institutions (such as the Tsarist regime in Russia), but also in the transformation of less efficient mechanisms into more efficient ones”. The west has surprised itself with its ability to respond to the misery inflicted on the people of Ukraine. All kinds of unimaginable images emerge. The German Bundestag cheered an extra €100bn (£82.4bn) on defence spending, followed by 100,000 people on the streets in protest at Putin. Matteo Salvini, the great Italian defender of Putin, bringing white tulips to the Ukrainian embassy. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, attending a meeting of the EU foreign affairs ministers meeting. The Hungarian leader, Viktor Orbán, sharply criticised by human-rights groups and others over the years for his hardline border policies, sitting on a school bench opening his arms to refugees. It was just a fortnight ago that the German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock had appeared at the Munich security conference to caution the crisis was not the moment to try to execute an 180 degree turn on the decades old German policy banning the sale of arms into conflict zones. Josep Borrell, the EU external affairs chief, batted away calls for Ukraine to join the EU, saying they already had an exceptional trade deal. He spoke about the “power of the EU’s language”, distancing himself from his own one time claim that the EU must learn “the language of power”. The next day – Sunday – all the talk was of Emmanuel Macron’s diplomatic initiative, and the concessions the French president had extracted from Vladimir Putin. Even on Wednesday, on the eve of the invasion, Baerbock gave an interview saying it was impossible for Germany to impose the strongest sanctions because of “the massive collateral damage” to Germany’s own economy. Putin could end up laughing at us, she warned. Yet by the following weekend, two days after the invasion began on Thursday, Germany’s coalition government had started that 180 degree course correction. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and his cabinet agreed to send Ukraine with 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, lifting restrictions on German weapons being sent to conflict zones by third parties in the process. The next day Scholz told the Bundestag in his trademark matter-of-fact manner that he was injecting €100bn into German defence, but protecting other budgets, and defence spending would rise above 2% of German GDP. The MPs from government and the CDU gasped and cheered in equal measure. David McAllister, a leading figure in the German CDU and chair of the European parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, admits he nearly fell off his chair when he heard the plans. The promised growth catapults Germany into becoming the third largest spender on defence globally, behind only the US and China. GlobalData forecasts an annual German defence budget of $83.5 billion in 2024, equating to a 45% increase on 2021’s budget of $57.5bn. That is bigger than France and the UK. Overnight Germany became not just an economic but also a geopolitical powerhouse. Polls said 78% of Germans backed the decision. Matthias Matthijs, Europe senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “It is quite astonishing how fast this government broke pretty well every taboo in postwar German foreign policy.” He attributes the scale of the change to a visit to Berlin on Sunday by the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany,” Morawiecki said. Sophia Besch, from the Centre for European Reform, points out Scholz himself insisted he had not acted due to pressure from allies, but due to Germany changing its view of the threat posed by Putin. “The truth is the world did not change last Thursday,” she said. “Berlin for years has ignored the warnings that came from many of our allies and from Putin. We need to learn the lessons of how this could have happened and how we could have been so blind. We are leaving behind some of our old beliefs – that economic interdependence prevents conflict, but I am not sure we know yet with what we are replacing this belief.” Sergey Lagodinsky, a German Green MEP, argued Germany now needs not just to spend more money, but to shift its mindset without becoming militaristic or interventionist. It needs to discuss how to adopt escalation, including military escalation, as leverage as part of its foreign policy toolbox. Foreign policy is not just a peace policy, Friedenspolitik in German, but also the ability to deal, manage and face conflict. But the new German coalition, faced by the need to extricate itself from Russian energy, may have to challenge other orthodoxies. The Green economics minister, Robert Habeck, does not rule out extending the use of coal-fired power plants. “This blind, naive, one-sided relationship of dependency on Russia for energy for decades is one of the biggest strategic mistakes of the past 20 years,” Lagodinsky said. “Now we are stuck. It represents a medium- and long-term problem”. But Putin’s recklessness is not just causing a revolution in Germany, but across Europe. Sweden abandoned its policy of not sending weapons to conflict zones, agreeing to send Bofors AT-4, a single-use anti-tank launcher, to Ukraine, plus medical supplies. In Finland a bombshell poll showed 53% want Finland to join Nato. “This poll flipped everything on its head,” said Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. Moreover the poll showed that if voters were told that politicians said they backed the plan the support went up to 2/3rds. “You could sense the president, Sauli Niinisto, realised the whole defence dynamic was changed.” Niinisto, seen as one of the best readers of what Putin is thinking is now rushing to hold urgent talks with Joe Biden in the White House. Even in Switzerland leaders had to catch up with the public mood in the space of a weekend, and by the Monday an emergency cabinet promised to implement the entire EU sanctions package. The decision does not formally end a policy of neutrality that has survived two world wars, but there is now pressure to track down the many oligarchs that live in the country. There are also calls for an increase in the defence budget There has been a mini-revolution in Italy too where the prime minister, Mario Draghi, accused last week of seeking sanctions carve-outs to protect Italy’s dependence on Russian gas, has also found some mettle. He told parliament on Tuesday: “Yes, we want peace, but it is obvious that whoever amassed more than 60km of tanks near Kiev does not want peace. We cannot turn our backs on Ukraine. Italy does not intend to look away.” He proposed an international public register of those with assets of more than €10m. In France, Macron looks likely to be re-elected comfortably next month as the rightwing candidates find themselves compromised by links to Putin they cannot deny. Eastern European countries, sometimes hostile to refugees, have instead had the most open arms. Poland has taken an unprecedented 600,000 people. Orbán the Hungarian leader photographed smiling at child refugees, vows “No one will be left uncared for.” The UK too has been experiencing unusually heavy traffic on the Road to Damascus. The Conservative government promises there will be no hiding place for oligarchs, publishing the delayed economic crime bill and seemingly unnerving Roman Abramovich into selling his stake in Chelsea football club. The endless denigration of Brussels has stopped. “The quality and intensity of the contacts between the EU and UK has been different to anything since before Brexit,” one EU official said. “We have restored a level of trust”. But it has been at the level of the European Union that the action has been quickest and most surprising, revealing Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission and former German defence minister, as a powerful advocate for action. For the EU to release €500m from the European Peace Facility to provide equipment and supplies to the Ukrainian armed forces, including - for the first time – lethal equipment, was a first. EU military staff based in Poland are now coordinating military supplies into Ukraine. The EU as a military player is no longer just the stuff of seminars. Equally the Commission in discussing its EU sanctions package acted with an unparalleled speed, and by consensus among the member states. Some EU sanctions packages take months to be agreed as one country or other exploiting the requirement for unanimity uses their veto power to pursue a national interest. That the UK, US and EU were able to coordinate an attack on the Russian central bank, freezing out of some Russian banks from the global Swift bank payment system and implementing measures to prevent Russian banks and firms raising capital showed a wholly unexpected level of resolve. This was a financial declaration of war – an attempt to turn Russia into a pariah economy – something never tried before, using methods never deployed before. It involved, for instance, some G20 central banks freezing the Russian central bank reserves held in their own jurisdiction, so depleting the war chest of reserves that Putin had accumulated to defend his economy if it came under western attack. All this is remarkable, indeed epoch making, but not a cause of celebration. The institutions of liberal democracy may have belatedly shown resolve and unity, but in the here and now they are still losing. Keir Giles from Chatham House thinktank is blunt. “Russia will want to present Zelenskiy with an appalling choice – whether to fight on at immense human cost and to the destruction of his country, infrastructure and economy or to submit to his terms in order that life can go on. “The decision to abandon Ukraine to that fate was made by the west when it gave the green light to Putin by reassuring him that no one would intervene. Nato does not have a strategy to win the war in Ukraine because Nato does not want to be in the war in Ukraine.” European politicians will also be worrying as the price of bread and energy soars in the months ahead whether voters are willing to make the sacrifice. The Lithuanian foreign minister told the UK foreign affairs select committee that half measures would not do. “Putin has no boundaries to what instruments he is going to use and unleash against the Ukrainians”, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said, adding the West “had to go all-in”. He wants humanitarian corridors supported by no fly zones. But the UK and the US have firmly rejected this since it would pit Nato pilots against Russian pilots. A Polish plan, backed by Borrell for Nato to provide Ukraine with Nato jets, training and bombs, got shot down in less than a day. The other remaining option is to end the final carve outs in the sanctions regime. “The push is now for carpet sanctions to match the carpet bombing,” said Orysia Lutsevych from the Ukraine Forum, adding the UK, EU and the US are still buying more than €700m of oil, gas and other commodities that is the equivalent of 150 tanks per day that Russian can finance. That could be stopped either through an energy trade embargo, or by reversing the EU decision to let Gazprombank and Sberbank, the vehicles through which Europe pays for Russian oil and gas, stay in the Swift payment system. UK officials briefed on Wednesday they want to abolish the carve out given by the EU. If these two banks are thrown out of Swift that might immobilise Russian oil and gas exports, or lead to unspecified retaliation by Putin. The breadth and range of economic and financial measures taken against Moscow, not to mention growing sporting and cultural isolation, has been a humiliation for Putin, but it is also a risk for the West if the Russian leader sees no answer but total victory. “He is in a corner, but unfortunately with nuclear weapons, says Giles. The west has been transformed in a week, but the question this weekend is if it would be willing, forced by the chaos of events, to go even further. The charge facing the west after a week of war is the one made by George Orwell of Neville Chamberlain in 1938. Like almost everyone at the time, he “neither wanted to pay the price of peace nor that of war”.",News/World news,The week where decades happened: how the west finally woke up to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/russia-ukraine-how-the-west-woke-up-to-vladimir-putin
3/5/2022,"The attack of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – Europe’s largest – has triggered international concern about the safety of the country’s facilities. Ukraine is heavily dependent on nuclear energy – it has four main power plants, with 15 reactors, generating about half its electricity. On Friday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said artillery fire at the plant could have caused destruction equal to “six Chernobyls”. For now, say experts, the immediate danger from the attack appears to be low, with Russia having as much to lose as anyone. “If there’s going to be a major nuclear incident it’s because something deliberately is being done,” said Tom Scott, professor in materials at the University of Bristol. “Surely nobody is going to be that stupid. It doesn’t benefit anyone. The wind is blowing towards Russia at the moment.” Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the IAEA UN nuclear watchdog, confirmed on Friday that radiation levels at the site had remained normal, that all safety systems at the plant were unaffected and that the reactors themselves had not been breached. The projectile had hit an administrative building some distance away within the site. Of the six reactors at the site, five are in safety mode, with one unit operating at 60% capacity. Reports from the site suggest that staff have continued to control operations. While Zelenskiy was quick to highlight the potential for a Chernobyl-scale incident, the technology at Zaporizhzhia is quite different. The Chernobyl reactor used graphite to keep the nuclear reaction under control and the disaster was caused by a graphite fire. The Zaporizhzhia plant – and those at Ukraine’s other main plants, Khmelnitski, Rovno and South Ukraine – has pressurised water reactors, a more modern type that do not involve graphite. So a fire such as the one at Chernobyl will not occur. Pressurised water reactors have a steel vessel at their centre, like a giant pressure cooker with 20cm-thick walls. This contains the nuclear fuel and radioactive products from the nuclear reaction and is designed to withstand damage from events such as earthquakes and aeroplane crashes, although not specifically artillery shells. The inner vessel is surrounded by a heavily steel reinforced concrete containment building – Chernobyl did not have this. For a Chernobyl-level event, both the pressure vessel and concrete bioshield would need to be breached and this would probably require intentional targeting with huge explosives. Nevertheless, there is deep concern that any attack aimed at taking control of a facility could still lead to a nuclear incident. Experts are especially alarmed that an internationally recognised principle – ensuring the physical integrity of civil nuclear plants – has been disregarded. “It’s very clear that this is against the Geneva conventions,” said Scott. “It is a flagrant breach of international laws and agreements to do this.” Grossi, who says the situation “continues to be extremely tense and challenging”, said on Friday that he had offered to travel to the Chernobyl site to facilitate a negotiation between Ukraine and Russia, with the aim of agreeing a framework to guarantee the safety of nuclear plants during the conflict. A concerning worst-case scenario, Scott said, was damage to the cooling capability at Zaporizhzhia or one of Ukraine’s other facilities. Even after reactors are switched off, they need continual cooling for several weeks in order to remove residual heat from the core. The cooling systems rely on diesel generators, so any damage to these – or if fuel was siphoned off for other purposes – could cause an incident similar to that at Fukushima, where the plant’s power failed after a tsunami. That could result in the reactors overheating and residual water turning into steam, which could melt the fuel inside the reactor and cause the release of radiation into the atmosphere. There is also a concern about spent fuel storage facilities being disturbed. After fuel is taken out of a reactor core, it is put into spent pool ponds for a year or more to physically cool down before being transferred to long-term, more secure storage.",News/World news,How safe are Ukraine’s nuclear power plants amid Russian attacks?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/how-safe-ukraine-nuclear-power-plants-russian-attacks-zaporizhzhia
3/5/2022,"When the subject of tricky foods for wine comes up, it generally focuses on miscreants such as asparagus, artichokes and eggs. But citrus can be even more of a problem. That might surprise you, given that there are quite a few citrussy wines, most notably sauvignon blanc, but if the citrus flavour in a dish is dominant, as it is in spaghetti al limone or chicken tagine with preserved lemon, say, you’re better off with a more neutral dry white or a red, because the lemon in the dish tends to strip out the citrus in the wine. Intensely lemony desserts, such as the classic French tarte au citron, are even more of a challenge, because they need very sweet wines that also match their acidity – late-harvest rieslings such as the Seifried number in today’s pick generally work best. Orange-flavoured desserts or cakes, such as orange polenta cake, can also be problematic. Spanish moscatels generally hit the spot, or try Hungary’s fabulously marmaladey tokaji. (If chocolate is involved, you could always turn to orange-flavoured liqueurs such as Cointreau or Grand Marnier.) Other solutions? So far as puds are concerned, cream or other dairy such as ricotta or cream cheese tends to mitigate the sharpness of lemon and lime. Lemon cheesecake is easier to pair than lemon tart, bringing in wines such as sauternes and similar sweet bordeaux as options. With savoury dishes, too, there are often other ingredients in a dish that will offset the citrus. In Greek lamb dishes that are seasoned with lemon, for example, it’s the lamb - and often the feta – that kicks lemony whites such as assyrtiko into touch. It can also be worth holding back on the lemon with, say, fish and chips, or a zesty salad to which you intend to add a squeeze of lime, and see how the wine tastes without it. A fresh, citrussy white or a limey Clare Valley riesling in the case of the salad could well do the job for you. Finally, bear in mind that the acid in citrus will accentuate the sweetness of any accompanying wine, so if you served a chardonnay, for example, with a lemony dish, it would probably taste richer and more buttery, and an already jammy shiraz even jammier. But that could, of course, be to your taste. Fresco di Masi Bianco 2021 £13.99 golden acre wines, 11%. Fresh, crisp but not overly citrussy, this attractive unfiltered organic white would drink really well with salads and fish dishes. Lion’s Den Assyrtiko 2019 £9.99 Aldi, 13%.

3/5/2022,"My boyfriend (aged 39) and I (36) have been together for nine months. We live together, have met each other’s family and friends and are generally very committed to each other – but he still hasn’t told me that he loves me. I’ve told him I love him, but nothing comes back. He also says very little about how he feels about me. He says he’s close to saying it, but needs time, and doesn’t want to be disappointed, as in his previous relationships. He feels he’s on a probation period – that if he doesn’t say it within a specific timeframe, I will leave him. I need and want to hear that he loves me, and feel that I’ve been patient. I don’t want to keep investing in a relationship where one day he’ll decide he doesn’t love me and we should break up. When we met, he was newly single after a five-year relationship and things moved fast. We get on well and have a lot in common, but sometimes we struggle with communication. He also has a quick temper. I often have to be the one to compromise. I had a tough childhood: I don’t speak to my birth father any more and I have trust issues. I did a lot of therapy to help me overcome my past, which worked well, and now I live a relatively normal happy life. On the other hand, he had a happy, stable childhood with no significant problems. We are very sensitive and emotionally aware and have good stable jobs to support us. Should I give up this expectation of hearing my boyfriend say “I love you”? I feel for both of you: here is a situation where you’re both justified in how you feel, but as you want different things, it has become a battle of right and wrong, when it’s not that binary. I don’t think you should give up anything that really matters to you, but neither do I think he can be forced into saying something he can’t say at the moment or doesn’t feel. But it’s you who’s written in, and you I’m concerned with. It’s destabilising being on a train whose destination you don’t know. Some people find it exciting but I, like you, need to know where I’m heading. It sounds as if you feel that him saying “I love you” will guarantee things. Unfortunately, it won’t, and I wonder if, even if he says it, it will be enough for you. Is there something else about him that makes you feel anxious? What have you been like in previous relationships? It’s how the relationship makes you feel that matters, more than what someone says. Silva Neves, a sexual and relationship counsellor (cosrt.org.uk) suggested you both look at what’s behind your feelings – could it be anxiety? You could both be feeling the same thing (some common ground!), but expressing it very differently. We were both concerned about his temper. Maybe he’s the sort of person who feels anger is a “better” emotion for a man than vulnerability. “When he loses his temper,” said Neves, “what does that do to you in relation to what your childhood was like? A lot of people find partners with similar traits to their parents, as a way to fix their past. Could your efforts to get your partner to say “I love you”, have something to do with your father?” Ultimately, if your partner doesn’t make you feel safe and loved – in word or deed – you have a right to look for those things elsewhere. But if everything else about this relationship is positive, and the “I love you” is the cherry on the cake, it may be worth waiting for him to catch up.

3/5/2022,"The Rugby Football Union’s decision this week in effect to ringfence the Premiership is disappointing to those fans who value a bit of jeopardy in their sport. By denying Ealing and Doncaster access to the top tier because they cannot hold the requisite 10,000 fans in their stadiums, the game’s governing body has sealed shut the trap door on the floor, creating a scenario where stodgy teams could drift on a breeze of mediocrity. Like the fortuitous bounce of an oval ball, the fixture list has served up a contest that will distract dissenters for the weekend at least. Leicester Tigers, sitting imperiously at the top of the table with 15 wins from 17 games, make the trip south to play Saracens, 16 points behind but with a game in hand. Two dynasties with a combined 15 titles between them have forged their success on powerful packs, a strong maul game and well-drilled set pieces and are the standout outfits this campaign. “They’re the best team in the league,” Steve Borthwick, Leicester’s coach who represented Saracens 144 times as a player, captaining them to their first league triumph in 2011, said of his rivals. “Look at the squad they’ve got, the resources they’ve got, how long the team has been together. They’ve got incredible ability.” In Vincent Koch at tighthead they have a World Cup winner. In Mako Vunipola and Sean Maitland they have two British & Irish Lions. Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola would make many pundits’ best England 15, and Aled Davies and Nick Tompkins are Wales internationals. They are also fresh from a bye and will be desperate to avenge their 13-12 defeat to Leicester in October courtesy of a late penalty try. Leicester’s last appearance in the semi-finals came in 2017. Their last title was back in 2013. This season proves that Borthwick’s project has left base camp with last season’s European Challenge Cup final defeat an important stepping stone. It is still a fresh squad, with nine of the starting 15 having fewer than 40 caps for the club, though they are complimented by a clutch of mainstays that includes Freddie Burns, Harry Wells and George Ford, captaining Leicester in his 119th game for them. The fly-half was released from the England squad by Eddie Jones and he is not the only player who has swapped the red rose for a club badge. Ollie Chessum (Leicester), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Bevan Rodd (Sale Sharks) and Daly at Saracens add star power to their respective teams. Luke Cowan-Dickie will not be among them. The England hooker could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury which is bad news for Exeter Chiefs, chasing a fourth consecutive win and ensconced in a crowded race for a top-four position. Nine points separate Saracens in second and Sale in seventh who would move above Exeter in fourth with a win on Sunday. Gloucester are also in the mix in sixth with a game in hand over the surrounding teams. The Cherry and Whites have nine academy products in the squad for the visit of Northampton Saints including Louis Rees-Zammit off the bench. It is a testament to the competitiveness of the league that 64% of its participants could still feasibly reach the next round. But eyes shrouded by furrowed brows will be on bottom-placed Bath as they host Bristol. Injuries to key players, including Taulupe Faletau, Joe Cokanasiga and Anthony Watson have played a part in their decline, but it is a damning sight when one of the league’s four original members is five points behind thrice-relegated Worcester. Bath will not go down no matter what transpires over the next three months.

3/5/2022,"California has introduced a bill that would allow nurse practitioners to provide abortion care without the supervision of a physician. The San Diego senator Toni Atkins, who introduced the bill, said the expansion of nurses’ roles would address both a looming shortage of healthcare professionals in the state, and help California prepare for a potential influx of patients driven by increasingly stringent abortion laws elsewhere. Atkins said the measure would be especially useful in serving communities of color that suffer most from understaffed healthcare systems. “When nurse practitioners are able to work independently, underserved communities – which are predominantly communities of color – benefit from an increase in access to services,” she added. “​​SB 1375 would create opportunities for more Californians to receive the care they need, regardless of their zip code.” The bill SB 1375 was announced on Wednesday, and would ease restrictions that were set in place by a 2013 law, which allowed nurse practitioners, certified midwives and physician assistants to carry out abortions as long as they were under the supervision of a physician and completed a certain set of requirements in their training. Under the new bill, nurses who obtain a minimum number of hours and clinical experience could perform the procedure unsupervised. Atkins said the goal is to increase the number of healthcare workers in California who can perform abortions ahead of a potential supreme court ruling this summer that could overturn Roe v Wade, allowing states to ban or severely restrict the procedure. “As states like Texas and others start to restrict further abortion, it just makes sense that women are going to find other places to go. California will be one of those states,” she said, indicating that the state will host women from places like Texas where the draconian abortion law has been in effect for six months. Atkins’s measure will probably sit well in a state that has already branded itself “a sanctuary” for patients seeking abortion care while other states clamp down on. In December, the California Future of Abortion Council announced a series of recommendations to consider to prepare for the high influx of prospective patients travelling from out of state that included paying for travel, lodging and access to care. Atkins also cited a potential shortage of healthcare workers in the next decade and highlighted how this bill could address that. According to a 2019 report by the California Future Health Workforce Commission, the state is expecting to see a drop of 4,100 primary care clinicians and 600,000 homecare providers. The scarcity is being driven by a retiring generation of healthcare providers, at a time when health departments are struggling to recruit workers due to “lack of tools for recruiting, limited options for advancement, and instability of funded positions”, the report said. One of the recommendations made in the report to address this shortage is to expand roles of nurse practitioners and to give them “greater practice authority”. “Families who live in clinic deserts found throughout the state have a particularly difficult time accessing primary care, because there simply are not enough providers available to them,” Senator Atkins said. “Nurse practitioners can help fill that growing need.” Patti Gurney, President of the California Association for Nurse Practitioners (CANP), lauded the move and said they are sponsoring the bill. “It is important that restrictions on practice be removed so that patients can receive timely, uninterrupted, and high-quality care in all health settings,” she said.",News/US news,California considers allowing nurses to perform abortions without doctors,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/california-abortion-nurse-practitioners-bill
3/5/2022,"The International Paralympic Committee president, Andrew Parsons, gave one of the most political speeches at an Olympics or Paralympics opening ceremony for decades, as he opened the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics saying: “I want – I must – begin with a message of peace as the leader of our organisation. I am horrified at what is taking place in the world right now. The 21st century is a time for dialogue and diplomacy, not war and hate.” Throwing away decades of tradition of making only guarded comments at such events, Parsons continued: “The Olympic Truce for peace during the Olympic and Paralympic Games is a UN resolution. It must be respected and observed, not violated. At the IPC we aspire to a better and more inclusive growth, free from discrimination, free from hate, free from ignorance, and free from conflict.” He finished his speech by almost bellowing the word “peace”. In 2014, in Sochi, the Ukrainian Winter Paralympics team had staged a symbolic protest, sending only one athlete to the opening ceremony to represent them as Russian troops invaded the Crimean peninsula. Eight years later, with their country again under attack from Russia, the scene was very different. Maksym Yarovyi carried in his nation’s flag in front of a full delegation, whose arrival in China had been fraught, while the Russian delegation announced that they would be leaving China rather than filing an immediate legal appeal over their expulsion. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Valerii Sushkevych, told a news conference on the eve of the Games: “It’s a miracle that we have made it to the Paralympics. We overcame a lot of barriers on the way.” He had himself slept on the floor of a bus during the last two days of their journey through Europe. With the ban on athletes from Russia and Belarus, 46 nations paraded in Beijing’s Bird’s Nest stadium, as the city became the first to host both the summer and winter editions of the Paralympics. “Let’s work together for a shared and brighter future,” said Cai Qi, the president of the Beijing organising committee. Athletes from Azerbaijan, Israel and Puerto Rico represented countries making their Winter Paralympics debut in a Games held not just under the shadow of war in Ukraine, but widely criticised for the decision to hold them in China at all, given the host nations’ human rights record. The Games run until Sunday 13 March, when the closing ceremony will take place in the same venue. Covid restrictions meant the crowd was limited, but there was no need to use the cardboard cut-outs of people employed at the Winter Olympics opening ceremony to boost the apparent numbers there. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, attended and formally declared the Games open. The Sochi bronze-medal winner Gregor Ewan and Paralympic debutant Meggan Dawson-Farrell were flag-bearers for the British Winter Paralympics team, who are sending their largest delegation of athletes – 25 in total – since Lillehammer in 1994. Ewan and Dawson-Farrell are part of the wheelchair curling team who will face Norway and then the United States in their opening matches on Saturday. British athletes will compete in five of the six sports at these Games: Alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, snowboarding as well as the wheelchair curling. Only the para ice hockey contest will not feature British representation. The medal hopefuls Millie Knight and Menna Fitzpatrick were absent from the parade, preparing for their Alpine Skiing races that start from 10am in Beijing (2am UK time) on Saturday morning. Meanwhile, the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC) confirmed its delegation would be leaving China. In a statement the RPC said it reserved “the right to apply to the appropriate international and national court” later, but that it was not “worthwhile at the current time to remain in Beijing”. They also singled out the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, for criticism, saying his call for Russian and Belarussian teams to be expelled from international events lead “to the degradation and collapse of the world sport”. Bach was absent from the opening ceremony, having tested positive for Covid-19 in the buildup. The RPC delegation are expected to depart China on Sunday.

3/5/2022,"Airbnb has suspended all operations in Russia and Belarus, and also stopped users of the home rental site from both countries from making any bookings, in the company’s latest response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. The home rental firm, which has almost 100,000 short-term rentals available across both countries according to the market research firm AirDNA, has been vocal in its support of Ukraine. Brian Chesky, the co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, who has added the Ukrainian flag to his Twitter profile, tweeted the suspension in a one-line post. Airbnb is suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus The company elaborated on Chesky’s tweet, adding that the ban would extend to Airbnb members of those countries trying to make any bookings on the site. “This means that we will block calendars from accepting new bookings in both countries until further notice,” said a spokesperson for the company. “We will also restrict users in Belarus and Russia from making new reservations as guests. We certainly hope that as we look to the future, a path to peace is forged.” Russia has more than 93,000 listings on Airbnb, and Belarus almost 4,000, according to AirDNA. On Thursday, Airbnb waived fees for hosts and those booking rentals in Ukraine. It took the decision after members of the public began making bookings in Ukraine with no intention of travelling as a way of providing financial support to residents facing hardship during the invasion. Ukraine has more than 17,000 active short-term rental listings. On Monday, Airbnb pledged to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The company has said it has received “overwhelming support” for the initiative, with more than 260,000 visitors so far to a dedicated web page where it is possible to sign up to be a host or to donate. Earlier this week, Chesky said the company was assessing its options regarding its Russian operation. “We don’t have a large business in Russia,” he told CNN. “It is not one of our major markets. [But] we are absolutely revisiting our relationship [about whether] to do business in Russia.” Last year, Airbnb took bookings for 300m nights across 4 million hosts globally, worth a total of $46.8bn (£35.3bn). The company, which was founded in 2008, was floated in 2020, soaring to a market value of about $100bn. Airbnb joins a rapidly increasing and extensive list of companies that are severing ties or pausing operations in Russia, including Ikea, the global recruitment company Hays, Apple, Netflix and all the major Hollywood studios, the retailers H&M, Marks & Spencer, Burberry and Boohoo, and car manufacturers including Ford, BMW and Mercedes-Benz.",News/Technology,Airbnb suspends all operations in Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/04/airbnb-suspends-all-operations-in-russia-and-belarus
3/5/2022,"When Chelsea and Manchester City step out at a sold-out Plough Lane on Saturday, somewhat incomprehensibly it will be the first time English football’s two dominant teams of recent years have met in a cup final. Since 2014 they have played one another in seven semi-finals and two quarter-finals and the Chelsea full-back Jonna Andersson is relishing the Continental League Cup final. “Finally,” she says. “We always say that we’re going to get them in the semi-finals. We were quite surprised when we didn’t, and now it’s finally a final. Hopefully both teams are happy about it because it’s a good final for us to play but also for people watching.” Chelsea are six points above City in the league with a game in hand and have done the WSL double over them, but any suggestion that Saturdaytoday’s game may not be a contest would be far from the mark. City staggered early in the season, hindered by injuries, losing seven of their first 14 matches in all competitions. Since then, though, they have lost once in 12 games: 1-0 against Chelsea. Chelsea faltered, too, picking up one win in five after their swashbuckling 3-0 defeat of Arsenal in the 2020-21 FA Cup final at the start of December, but are since unbeaten in six. Emma Hayes’s side are perhaps still favourites, although we are yet to see whether the off-field turmoil around the club seeps on to it. Andersson’s key task will be dealing with City’s potent wingers Lauren Hemp and Jess Park. “They have so many good players and especially wingers that like going forward with a lot of pace and that are very good one versus one,” she says. “We just need to focus on our gameplan and what we can do, but of course we need to try to stop them as well because we know that’s one of their biggest threats.” It is in defence where Hayes has been most experimental this season and Andersson and the rest of the players who rotate along the backline have taken time to get used to switching between a back four and back three. “You just need to be flexible and really, really understand the different kinds of formations because you have to be able to switch between them as well in games or in weeks,” the Sweden international says. “I want to be an attacking full-back. When I’ve been playing as a wing-back in 3-4-3 or 3-5-2 of course I need to be more involved in maybe the one versus one attacking plays so I have to try to improve these kinds of things. When I’ve been a full-back as a back four it’s maybe more coming from behind running overlaps and underlaps.” Andersson has had a solid season, bouncing back from a tough end to the previous campaign, when she was dropped to the bench for Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final second leg and the final. “You have these moments during the season, during the games,” she says. “That was maybe a tougher period for me personally, but I still think it’s a team sport and you need to try to stick together. It was a tough time, but I think I’ve learned a lot from it as well and have come out stronger.” She has had to. It had been expected by many that Hayes would dip into the transfer market to improve her options at full-back and the manager admitted early in the season: “It’s not that we didn’t target players, we just didn’t get the ones that we wanted.” Andersson was unfazed by the chatter. “That’s something the media has said – Emma has never said it to me – but I also know that I need to be on top in training and games to be able to play and start for Chelsea. That probably just gives me more energy. It shows that I need to improve and get better every day.” It is that kind of fight that Hayes looks for in players and is something Chelsea need to power them to an unbeaten run to the end of the season if they are to repeat their domestic treble. “I’m not going to say we’re used to [winning and the pressure] but that’s where we want to be; we want to win everything we can,” Andersson says. “If we drop some points there is still going to be a big chance to win the league. It’s not finished yet. You can’t tell who’s going to win or who’s going to be the second or third, it’s so even, and you need to take every game as a final.”",Sport/Football,Jonna Andersson relishes Chelsea meeting with City in League Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/04/jonna-andersson-relishes-chelsea-meeting-with-city-in-league-cup-final
3/5/2022,"As the CIA and MI6 try to predict the next gambit of the unstable leader in the Kremlin, Britons flinch at reports of the possible use of nuclear weapons. But this is 1962; Khrushchev not Putin. ITV’s new adaptation of Len Deighton’s cold war novel The Ipcress File – which was a 60s-defining movie starring Michael Caine as the working-class spy Harry Palmer – was meant to be a period piece for 2022 viewers. But the Russian president’s invasion of Ukraine, and pointed reminders to the world about the size of his nuclear weapons, have given the Sunday night drama a new context. “I thought I was writing history, but it turned out to be current affairs,” says screenwriter John Hodge. “When you pitch a script, you’re always asked: ‘What’s relevant about this? Why should we make it now?’ And with The Ipcress File, there was a fear that this stuff was so long ago. Our line was actually always that, in the cold war, people were very much aware of the threat of nuclear annihilation but it hasn’t gone away because of the number of warheads and rogue players and so on. But it feels terrible to be proved right.” As Hodge’s Oscar-nominated script for Danny Boyle’s 1996 movie Trainspotting was on screen within three years of Irvine Welsh’s novel, and his adaptation of Alex Garland’s The Beach in 2000 appeared just four years after the hardback, Deighton’s 1962 novel is by far the oldest source material Hodge has ever brought to our screens – and the first that has already been a movie. His version of The Ipcress File, though, is very different from either the 1962 book or the 1965 Caine film about a kidnapped British nuclear scientist. The novel is a first-person narrative and the movie dominated by Palmer, but Hodge has “given voices to other characters. Six hours of TV demands huge amounts of story compared to a movie. You need more central characters.” The TV version spreads the action between the new Palmer, played by Joe Cole), British agent Jean (Lucy Boynton), her spymaster Dalby (Tom Hollander) and CIA agent Maddox (Ashley Thomas). The fact that an African American spy was plausible (though rare) at that time, when the English secret service was hideously white, also allows the series to achieve both historical realism and diversity: “It is a balance between being true to the era and writing something a modern audience can relate to.” Cole, after a clever bit of business with the thick black-framed spectacles that were Caine’s visual signature, takes the role in a new direction, helped by a new backstory featuring thrilling scenes in Berlin that Deighton never imagined. Hodge and director James Watkins (Black Mirror, McMafia) “felt we needed something to introduce Harry,” says Hodge. “I think in a movie you can just say here’s a spy and go along with him. But TV audiences need to know a bit more about the characters … so I wrote a sequence about how Harry got involved, rather unwillingly, in espionage.” In the 60s, the cockney boy confidently dining at the highest tables was seen as a symbol of England’s social evolution. But now, says Hodge, we see it differently. “This is set at a time when the next five British prime ministers [Wilson, Heath, Callaghan, Thatcher and Major] are going to be from state schools, and it feels, in that moment, that the Old Etonians are over. But obviously we now know that they weren’t.” Hodge has also done a lot of plot renovation. “I think Deighton lost interest in the plot halfway through the novel, and it’s a series of comic riffs after that.” He sees it as a story about the emergence of a modern culture in Britain, after the still literally and metaphorically rationed 1950s: flying to Rome or Paris seems impossibly glamorous, and exotic delicatessens offer unimaginable foodstuffs such as pomegranate. The show covers 1962 to 63, and older viewers and history students will delight in trying to anticipate how Hodge might bring in what he calls “high 60s moments” – the Cuban missile crisis, the Profumo sex scandal, the presidency of John F Kennedy: “One of the pleasures of writing recent historical fiction is that you can aim for these landmarks that some of the audience will be anticipating.” Deighton’s cheekily meritocratic spook has widely been seen as an anti-James Bond and, oddly, working on The Ipcress File was also post-007 for Hodge. He and Boyle (his director on Trainspotting, its sequel T2 and Shallow Grave) were employed on “Bond 25”, which subsequently became last year’s No Time to Die; they co-wrote a script before being sacked. “I think it was me they really wanted rid of, but Danny took the bullet, too,” says Hodge. Do non-disclosure agreements cover their departure? “No. Just decent British discretion!” At the time Hodge and Boyle learned they would not write another day, there were suggestions they had spooked the producers by pitching an incredibly subversive storyline. But the released movie contains a twist at least as dramatic, which seems to disprove the rumour they had gone too far. “My understanding was that that twist had been decided even before we came on board because Daniel Craig wanted it. I think, with us, it was that old cliche “creative differences”. It felt very dramatic at the time but it was just another bump in the road of the Bond franchise.” As Hodge says he is sparing with scene directions (“I don’t like to tell directors what to do”), I wonder about the spectacular action sequences in a Bond movie. Do you just write “the island rises into the air and explodes” and let them get on with it? “I kind of hoped that was the case, because in a big action movie, the action is worked out between the director and numerous departments. But for some reason, they want you to write the action. It’s the thing I hate doing most: ‘The car skids round the corner, bouncing off the kerb. Inside the car, Jack Wiley lights a cigarette’ etc. And you can only get it wrong: they either tell you it’s too expensive or say it’s too unambitious because a plane already flew through the Deptford Tunnel in Fast and Furious 7, or whatever.” Hodge still has his Bond script on a laptop. When he saw the movie, he found that “half a line” of his dialogue had survived. What is it? “Aaaargh, I can’t. It’s their film. I don’t want to seem like the guy who got paid and goes round telling stories about them.” He didn’t even tell his family what the half-line was. “Look, it’s the screenwriter’s life. If you’re lucky, you get a job, and sometimes that job doesn’t end well.” If this ITV show is successful, Hodge would like to adapt Deighton’s 1965 novel Billion Dollar Brain (also a film with Caine), which is about viral warfare, and which may also have reached an interesting moment for a remake. He does not, though, expect Trainspotting to become a trilogy. “I think that’s done. In that heady atmosphere of producing T2, we talked about coming back to it. But the second film was not as exciting as the first, and to me that was a reflection of the fact that life isn’t as exciting in your 40s and 50s as in your 20s. I was at peace with that. Any idea of getting the gang back together for more hijinks just feels misguided to me.” He and Boyle are “developing an idea for a feature film, which is quite an old-fashioned idea these days. And, like most writers in the UK at the moment, we’re trying to think of ideas we can pitch to a big streamer for a vast multiseason international show!” The Ipcress File starts on 6 March at 9pm on ITV.

3/5/2022,"Glasses are glamour’s last taboo. You can embrace silver-grey hair and be on the cover of Vogue, like Kristen McMenamy. Armpit hair with a party frock is cool, thanks to Julia Roberts and Miley Cyrus. At 84 and 76, Jane Fonda and Helen Mirren still reign on beauty billboards without having their crow’s feet airbrushed out.And yet, women are still expected to whip off their glasses when the cameras start flashing. Roberts, Fonda and Mirren all wear glasses off duty, but tend not to on camera. When Annie Leibovitz photographed Jill Biden for Vogue last year, the first lady wore glasses in a casual portrait used inside the magazine, but took them off for the cover. At the 2016 Oscars, the black spectacles Kate Winslet wore to present an award were nowhere to be seen on the red carpet. But this could be the year all that changes. The post-pandemic take-me-as-I-am look is lending the way we have always looked behind closed doors – hoodie, scrunchie, glasses rather than contacts – a newly acceptable vibe, at least on Zoom. Remember Meryl Streep in her lockdown robe and glasses, straining her cocktail shaker into her martini glass? A total mood. This year, Mirabel Madrigal in Encanto became the first bespectacled Disney princess.Meryl is 72; Mirabel is 15. Glasses are not just a getting-older thing, nor only a teen fad. At the mature end of the scale, the visibility of glasses has a lot to do with the visibility of older women. Midlife women have main character energy on screen these days, and since wearing glasses is often part of the narrative of getting older, spectacles come with that territory. From the first episode of Sex and the City sequel And Just Like That, the passing of time for Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte was marked by the fact that when they sat down to brunch, they took out their glasses to read the menu. In their real lives, too, women stay in the spotlight as they grow older and start wearing glasses. We’re used to Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston as de facto specs wearers – though neither wore them for last year’s Friends Reunion. The latest crop of supermodels – Kendall Jenner, Emily Ratajkowski, Hailey Bieber, both Gigi and Bella Hadid – are the first to be regularly seen in glasses. For a generation whose appearance is more ruthlessly curated and filtered than ever, this is not about a lack of effort. Authenticity is almost an Instagram filter in its own right. Adding specs to your selfies looks adorable, just like adding puppy ears or a flower crown. Millennials grew up with Harry Potter; generation Z with disposable contacts and laser eye surgery. Glasses are no longer seen as an unfortunate necessity, but a choice. On TikTok, last year’s cottagecore has been replaced by Dark Academia, which (your correspondent writes, adjusting her specs to squint at the screen) seems to be about reading Donna Tartt while wearing glasses and preppy clothes from Depop, and having lots of candles burning while you do your homework. Go figure.A lot of us, of all ages, have skin in this game. A survey last year by the College of Optometrists found that a third of British people believed their eyesight had deteriorated over the pandemic. The go-to parental warning of screens being bad for eyes is backed by recent research. The good news is that the harm may be reversible.

3/5/2022,"At first glance, Gran Turismo 7 offers much the same experience as the original game did back in 1997: an idiosyncratically clean aesthetic, a focus on authentic handling and impossibly shiny cars that put any carwash to shame. There have been some tweaks under the hood, as you would expect, and one major alteration that will probably divide fans, but this 25-year-old motor is very much still running. One thing that hasn’t changed is Sony-owned developer Polyphony Digital’s synergistic mastery of PlayStation hardware. Gran Turismo has always been trotted out to demonstrate the true graphical potential of Sony’s consoles, and Gran Turismo 7 slips into its traditional role of technical showcase with ease on PlayStation 5. While it remains compatible with the PlayStation 4, on the newer machine this is a jaw-slackeningly beautiful game. Each vehicle is fettled in obsessive detail, down to the exact arrangement of reflective elements in an individual car’s headlights. The game also provides the best workout for the haptic trickery of the PS5’s DualSense controller yet. In a racing simulator, understanding the forces to which the car is subjected at any given moment is crucial, and GT7 turns this handheld collection of vibration motors and resistive triggers into a remarkably effective communication tool. The much anticipated car-collecting campaign mode returns after its absence in Gran Turismo Sport, and it’ll grab most of the headlines. But in a move that is likely to frustrate longstanding fans, it’s surprisingly different this time round. Instead of the other titles’ more freeform vehicle-purchasing exploration, your route through the early part of the game is tightly controlled and punctuated with educational mini-lectures on significant or enduring aspects of car culture. Series creator Kazunori Yamauchi evidently sees preservation of this culture as a solemn responsibility in a changing automotive landscape, something that’s clearly reflected in the charming yet slightly stuffy delivery of these history lessons. Less forgivably, earning money can be painfully slow, the occasional gift roulettes are comically miserly, and the most desirable cars are phenomenally expensive and often only fleetingly available as the in-game markets shift. The result is enormous longevity for those with the patience, but even then there’s the nagging sense that the entire economy is built to coerce players into spending real money to secure their favourites. Fortunately, the time you spend out on the track, whether alone or in the cleverly regulated multiplayer mode, is a pleasure. The handling model, the core of any racing sim, remains hugely engaging. The most profound additions to the driving experience are two features that are neither completely new nor particularly glamorous, but they are executed superlatively: the changing time of day and weather conditions, which are nothing less than a full-blown atmospheric simulation. Spotting your braking at the end of the Le Mans 24 Hour circuit’s infamous Mulsanne straight becomes an entirely different challenge as the sun gradually dips below the horizon, and even from a solely aesthetic perspective, it’s difficult not to feel utterly transported as you sweep towards Yokohama docks through the early morning mist, rays of the rising sun bouncing off the asphalt. Rather than the old binary of wet and dry races, certain circuits can evolve as the session progresses. If it’s damp but not actively raining, a visible drying line may appear as cars displace the standing water, but races just as often begin wet and get even wetter, offering up less grip as the asphalt becomes completely saturated. Arriving at an event with no idea of the conditions you will encounter, but being able to accurately read the road in front of you, extends the novelty of the already generous number of cars and circuits available. That said, neither of the two British circuits, Brands Hatch and Goodwood, support wet weather at all, which does beg the question: has Yamauchi ever visited the UK? It’s reassuring that despite ever-greater technical refinement, Gran Turismo’s unique, eccentric character remains intact. It’s present in the grab-bag mission mode, which handily demonstrates that a race between 17 brake horsepower Fiat 500s can be just as gripping as one between cars with 50 times that. It manifests most obviously in the utterly bemusing music rally mode, which has you hitting checkpoints to the strains of 80s pop relic Hooked on Classics. Keeping this distinctive spirit alive in the era of 4K and 60 frames a second, Gran Turismo 7 feels both fresh and comfortingly familiar.

3/5/2022,"The price of food including pork is likely to rise significantly as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a UK environment minister has warned. Victoria Prentis, the Defra minister responsible for farming, also suggested Britons may want to stop buying Russian white fish, which makes up about a third of the volume consumed in the UK. Prentis warned that British people would have to become more willing to pay premium prices for quality food produced domestically. Speaking at the launch of the Conservative Environment Network’s Green Albion essay collection, she said: “I’ve been having really important meetings with the fishing industry. Thirty per cent of our white fish, for example, is imported from Russia. Get real, guys.” The minister told the Guardian further sanctions were being considered that could affect the fishing industry, but suggested consumers boycott the Russian fish. She said: “For now, do we really want to be buying Russian fish?” Prior to the invasion, Prentis had been mostly focused on the cost of living crisis as well as the shift to more environmentally friendly farming, implementing the environmental land management schemes (Elms) which would have farmers paid subsidies for improving biodiversity and nature on their land. However, she has found herself dealing with potential supply-chain failures as a result of the war. “I am going to dial down the optimism because we are in the middle of the most extraordinary series of world events,” she said. As an example of how the events in Europe could drive up prices, the minister said: “I’ve been talking to the pig industry – a very, very difficult supply chain at all levels – are we prepared to buy more British high-welfare pigs? We will have to pay more.” She said that while environmental policies were still a priority, “we need to make sure that the policy we’re making at every stage is correct to the stage we’re in. And frankly the stage for this week is completely different from the stage we were in last week.” There are fears of a wheat crisis on the continent, as Russia and Ukraine account for 14% of global wheat production, ranking first and fifth, respectively. The countries together account for nearly 30% of global wheat exports. Prentis has been meeting her counterparts in Europe to discuss this. She said: “I am so grateful that in this country we grow 88% of the wheat we eat. I met the Albanian foreign minister earlier this week, who imports 44% of her wheat – in a very poor country – from Ukraine. We are in a very fortunate position in many ways.” Another battle Prentis has been fighting is with her Conservative colleagues who have criticised the Elms scheme. Some of her critics argue that farmers should be given more subsidies for producing food rather than solely for environmental goods. The Conservative MP Neil Parish, who chairs the environment select committee, recently said: “There is an issue of food security, because Ukraine is the breadbasket of the world, as is the western part of Russia: I have visited Bryansk in the past and I remember that the one thing I wanted to bring home with me was the soil. I have never seen such beautiful soil in my life. It can grow absolutely everything. “As we change agricultural policy, we need to protect the environment but we need food. There is not enough food in the Agriculture Act.” Prentis said of her critics: “I really feel that we’ve got to stop viewing ourselves as environmentalists or farmers and there being any sort of boundary between the two. “Quite frankly, it really pisses me off that so many of us are onboard with this programme and we are going in one direction but that we are having these ridiculous arguments about which bit [of funding] goes where in the programme.”",News/Environment,"UK pork prices likely to rise due to Russia-Ukraine conflict, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/04/pork-prices-likely-to-rise-due-to-russian-invasion-of-ukraine-says-defra-minister
3/5/2022,"The first day of the [Russian] invasion [of Ukraine] was my 15th wedding anniversary. We had planned a party with friends and had booked a table in a restaurant. But early morning, around 5am, my family – my wife and my 10-year-old son – were woken by Russian rockets flying over our house. The first thought was to grab everything we could and leave. But all the roads were blocked with traffic, and they were shelling us all the time. It was terrifying. So we went to a nearby underground car park and spent the whole day there. There were about 60 people there on the first day. It was cold, there was no heating and people were lying on the floor. Occasionally we dashed back to the apartment to get supplies – we live on the 14th floor and the elevator was still working – that first day we were eating things like cookies and crisps, anything you could grab in a second. We slept in the car park in our car. My son was in the back seat, my wife and I in the front, half sitting and half lying down. I am almost 2 metres (6ft 6in) tall so it wasn’t very comfortable. We tried to think about our anniversary – about the wonderful 15 years we had together, that we have a God-blessed 10-year-old son whom we love very much. But that first day – it was just about fear. Waking up in the car felt horrible, my back was aching like never before. In the morning the bombing was quiet – well, almost quiet. The meaning of the word “quiet” was changing – when you hear only two explosions, instead of 10. We went home and quickly ate porridge for breakfast. Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. Ukrainians are friendly people and we know almost all of our neighbours very well. So we started to organise getting food and water for those who couldn’t – filling up water bottles in the apartment, fetching food, making a space in the car park for women with children to feed and change them in privacy. We weighed up leaving, but the traffic was still very bad. And we were thinking maybe this madness would stop. That night we slept underground again. 26 February The third day some friends got sick from the cold in the car park and we decided to return to our apartment and try to live normally – take a shower, cook meals, give lessons to our son and get him playing online chess. We taped our windows. The elevator was no longer working. My son’s a very brave boy. He’s trying not to cry. He’s trying to help. But every time the siren sounds from outside the window, and we have to run downstairs to the shelter again, I can see he’s scared. But he doesn’t panic. That day I was standing with a neighbour outside in our yard. Suddenly we heard gunshots from automatic rifles close by. Later I read the news via Telegram that Russian troops were trying to infiltrate the city. It said they were liquidated. At the moment you hear gunfire, you’re not afraid – you don’t have time to be afraid, you just have to get your son to safety in the car park. The shock comes a little later, when you realise you could have been killed. Or worse, your wife and child could be killed and you survive. By Sunday, some of the small neighbourhood shops had opened again. This war has transformed our reality – an open shop or gas station felt like a return to normal life. But when you queue there’s a real possibility you may be killed. Inside the store, there were only a few supplies. But the shelves weren’t empty, thanks to previous customers, thinking about those still queueing. I shared the food between our family and other people in the car park. The numbers had now grown to about 150. I started to organise more supplies for everyone: food, water, toilet paper. That night in our apartment we phoned everyone to check they are safe. My wife and son slept in our bedroom, and I slept in my son’s room. His part of the building is closer to the siren. To make sure I hear it, I left the window open while I slept – well, you can’t really call it sleep. You just lie with your eyes closed. You sleep fully dressed next to a bag with documents and food. Everybody here is exhausted. On Monday some of the big stores in the city were open for a few hours. I took my car to fill up on supplies. I went alone and I stayed on speakerphone with my wife, and she continuously tracked my location from my phone. Every time I was stopped at a roadblock to get my documents checked, I asked our soldiers, “What do you need?” I brought them things like cigarettes and water. It’s my thanks to these people who defend us, defend Ukraine, standing 24/7 outside in the cold with no sleep. Ukraine is tiny compared with Russia and our army is much smaller. But the braveness of people here, and how they have shown they are ready to defend the country until the last breath, gives me hope. When I was driving back from getting gas on Tuesday, my wife phoned me. “We can see smoke coming from the Holocaust memorial complex,” she said. I was absolutely devastated. I am Jewish. My father is 83 and survived the Holocaust, which killed half my family. We went to the memorial very often because I wanted my son to know the history. My father has memories of running across a field to get away from bombs. Now, my son has to do the same, but it’s not Hitler, it’s Putin who is bombing us. I was completely shocked and depressed. It’s no secret that our president in Ukraine is a Jew. We all support our president, we are very proud of him. I know people in Russia. Half of them are not my friends any more. A couple of them tried to tell me it was us who started this war. I just blocked them; I don’t want to read the crap they are writing. Russian TV has washed their brains – as a friend told me, “it’s not TV, it’s radiation”. On Wednesday the Russians told us you better leave Kyiv. My wife and I were still thinking about whether to go. There were two things stopping us. First, her parents are in Chernihiv. We were desperately trying to get them out, out of that hell – so they could come with us. And second, I still wanted to help people here. I’m a very peaceful person. The only way I would fight is if they come to my home – I will defend my family. At this point, I was doing my best to help the people who defend us and those who need help. We realised if we decided to leave for western Europe, where we have family, we needed different clothes, not the skiing jackets and winter clothes we packed on the first day. As the elevator was still broken, I had to lug four suitcases up the stairs to the 14th floor, one by one. We finally made the decision to go. I was nervous, but after Putin’s conversation with Macron on Thursday, and hearing about his aim to control all of Ukraine, we now understood that he won’t stop until he ruins all this country. We were not prepared to live in Putin’s Russia. But mostly, the decision was about the safety of my son and wife. We didn’t want him to see the war any more, to wake up and be afraid of bombing and tanks. He was very sad about leaving without his grandparents. We didn’t want to leave them either, but we needed to take care of our son.",News/World news,"‘My son is brave, but he’s scared’: Kyiv father’s diary of first week of invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/04/kyiv-diary-russia-ukraine-invasion-first-week
3/5/2022,"ABel Air mega mansion marketed as “America’s most expensive residence” sold in an bankruptcy auction on Thursday with a winning bid of $126m, a fraction of its reported original asking price of half a billion dollars. The 21-bedroom home – described as “twice as big as the White House” – has been derided as much as praised, making its sale a hotly anticipated event. The elite team of realtors behind the auction touted it as the ultimate dream estate but others called it a “giant white elephant” and “one of the ugliest homes I’ve ever seen”. The New York Post labeled it “the latest example of a hyped Los Angeles mega mansion that failed to perform”, and suggested its failure to meet the listing price meant that the city’s “cheeseball” taste in real estate might be starting to improve. With a final sale price of roughly $141m, which included the winning bid plus commissions and fees, the property did not even bring in half of its listing price of $295m. Developers and real estate agents had dubbed the property “The One”, and said a residence of its scale would never be built again in Los Angeles. The 100,000 sq foot hilltop mansion built over the last decade is surrounded on three sides by a large moat and has 360 degree views of Los Angeles, the mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Its amenities include 42 full bathrooms and 7 half bathrooms, a nightclub, a private running track, a 40-seat movie screening room, a juice bar, a cigar lounge, a “philanthropy pavilion”, a 30-plus car garage with two car-display turntables, a 10,000-bottle wine cellar, and five pools and other “water features”, including a private pool to accompany the master bedroom. There is also a bowling alley, with four lanes. Despite its hefty price tag, the property comes with a host of issues. It has been mired in legal battles and bankruptcy proceedings, and its current auction, which is being overseen by a bankruptcy court, was postponed several times to try to attract more potential wealthy buyers. Of concern to those buyers, The One still does not have a certificate of occupancy, the final health and safety permit needed to certify that it’s ready for residents to actually move in, and it still needs some “finishing touches”, as one realtor put it, since its construction is not complete. The strikingly low price is most likely a result of the unfinished state of the property, and the amount of additional work that will be necessary “to get it into a condition where it can be occupied”, said Byron Moldo, a Los Angeles attorney specializing in bankruptcy law, and does not necessarily mean the era of the mega mansion is over. A court-appointed receiver had estimated the property needed at least $10m to fix problems such as cracked marble and water leakage, the Los Angeles Times reported. The prospect of dealing with a $141m fixer-upper “could have had a large impact in terms of perhaps limiting the number of interested buyers, and how much they’re prepared to pay”, Moldo said. While the identity of the buyer must be disclosed as part of the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, it might be a corporation or an LLC designed to shield the identity of the purchaser, he said. A bankruptcy court judge will review and approve the sale later this month. According to bankruptcy court records, the current debt on the property totals $191m, the Los Angeles Time reported. With a sale price tens of millions of dollars below that, some of the creditors who loaned money to build the mansion will probably get only partial repayment, and some may get nothing at all, Moldo said. The judge will also oversee disputes over who gets how much money from the property’s much-delayed sale. Niles Niami, the mansion developer who built The One, and described his aesthetic, simply, as “badass”, had floated increasingly desperate plans to avoid auctioning it off, the Los Angeles Times reported, including turning it into an events space for boxing matches and holographic appearances of dead celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston, and making a cryptocurrency called “The One Coin” backed by the value of the property. Niami did not immediately respond to attempts to contact him after the auction’s close. However divisive, the sale of The One is consistent with a pandemic-driven shift in the tastes of the super-rich, said Chad Roffers, the president of Concierge Auctions, which conducted the online sale. While the world’s wealthy have recently tended to favor smaller, well-placed apartments in major cities (the previous most expensive US home was a $238m for a New York City penthouse), the experience of “being in a lockdown” has seen demand for “really big” properties surge – a trend that harks back to the mega mansions of the early aughts. While in many promotional photographs The One resembles a giant, frigid airport terminal, real estate agents involved with the sale have said that, in person, the house is full of thoughtful touches and very livable. While the participants in the auction were anonymous to the public, Roffers, the president of the online auction house, said their clients typically fit a certain profile: “Their world is private jets that they own, or at least share,” he said. “Some people are into art, some people are into wine, some people are into cars, some people are into everything. We really identify a niche of people who are property collectors. They’re always on the lookout for a unique property.” Of his company’s roughly 8,000 verified private clients, he said, 267 are billionaires. For these types of clients, The One has an obvious appeal: “Just the sheer magnitude of it is attractive to the right person,” he said. The much-hyped online auction for The One played out against the backdrop of an escalating war in Ukraine, as Russian oligarchs faced new financial sanctions, and at least one saw his giant yacht seized by the French government. While the context of shelling in Ukraine and massive economic sanctions on Russia was “disturbing” and likely to be on everyone’s minds, Roffers said in advance of the auction that he did not think it would affect the bidding. There were thousands of documented billionaires across the world, he said, “and most of them are from somewhere other than that part of Europe”. But after months of debate and speculation, the auction for The One on Thursday evening played out in a sluggish fashion, with only four bidders in total. In the last half hour, when online auctions typically heat up, there was still almost no movement. Only in the final two minutes did the price move above $70m, as a dueling pair of anonymous bidders pushed the price slightly above $100m. The $141m final price tag is not a record-breaking price for the sale of a residential property in the US, or even in California, where venture capitalist Marc Andreessen spent $177m last year on a Malibu estate, breaking a previous $165m California residential property record set by Jeff Bezos. It does break a record in a more technical category. The handful of bids on the property in the early days of the auction, which put its price at $70m, “already surpassed the highest US record for a property sold at auction”, Roffers said, which he said was $51m for a Beverly Hills mansion in 2021.",News/US news,Mega mansion flop: hyped LA home sells for less than half its $500m asking price,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/04/mega-mansion-los-angeles-real-estate

3/5/2022,"The nearest thing New York has to the Imperial War Museum in London is the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, built on and around the USS Intrepid, a hulking great aircraft carrier parked at Pier 86 on the Hudson River. It is the obligation of every school age-child in greater New York to attend this museum at least once a year, and on the last day of mid-winter recess, we do. It’s an odd time in which to find oneself in a museum of war. The Intrepid was in service from 1943 through to the 1970s, when it acted as an anti-submarine vessel tracking Soviet submarines in the north Atlantic. Most of the exhibits focus on Vietnam, with a display of faded we-regret-to-inform you telegrams, dog tags, and oral accounts of life on board ship. A special exhibit explores the nuclear submarines of the old war and invites visitors to imagine how it may have felt to live on the brink of nuclear annihilation. The poignancy of the old photos, depicting young men in sepia tones squinting up at the camera, is accompanied by a sense of the endless squandering of young human life, and the head-spinning consideration that the events of this week will, in all probability, be pasted on to these same museum walls one day, to interest and bore future children. The Intrepid also discreetly communicates to visitors the terrors of even the mildest simulation of combat experience. Accompanied by one child at a time, I enter the two-seat “G-Force experience” ride, where I am flipped upside down, freak out as my child starts to slip through her harness, reach to hit the emergency stop button, am promptly flipped back around again, and leave the ride wondering if I’m going to throw up. Afterwards, we walk to the submarine, which is parked alongside the Intrepid and open for visitors, but are all far too claustrophobic to go in. Will history remember the ancillary role played by Liz Truss this week? It is wrong, perhaps, to be even darkly amused by this, and yet the Kremlin blaming its escalation to nuclear readiness on the words of the British foreign secretary, has about it the air of a shelved Mr Bean storyline. Here she is, our hapless heroine – leaver of weird pauses, enemy of Britain’s cheese import policies, wearer of Perestroika-era hats – inadvertently triggering events that may lead to the end of the world. Speaking on Sky News on Sunday, Truss said, “This long-running conflict is about freedom and democracy in Europe,” a bland enough statement that was, nonetheless, seized on by the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, and denounced as so “unacceptable” as to put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert. It wasn’t Truss’s fault, of course. She might have said anything, as she so frequently does, and the response from the Kremlin would have been the same. “If we don’t stop Putin in Ukraine,” she continued, “we are going to see others under threat: the Baltics, Poland, Moldova, and it could end up in a conflict with Nato.”. Rallying every shred of Churchillian eloquence, Truss ended with the ominous observation that “we do not want to go there”, as true a thing as has ever been said. We totes don’t want to go there, Liz. For realz. Watching Trump speak in public was never a relaxing affair, but watching Biden can be almost as bad. On Wednesday morning, political analysts pick over his performance in the State of the Union address the previous night, highlighting his plans to discourage Putin, curb inflation, and unite Americans in the cause of world freedom. For me, however, the speech was notable for the moment-by-moment terror of wondering if Biden would stumble, freeze, or forget his words, and how this would play to hostile eyes on the other side of the world. At 79, Biden is 10 years older than Putin, and at the risk of sounding unpatriotic, on Tuesday night he looked his age. I found myself casting around for reassurances. It was useful to remember, when he fluffed his lines, appeared to lose his place, and seemed to say “Iranian” instead of “Ukrainian”, that Biden was like this even as a much younger politician. There was reassurance to be had, too, in seeing the youthful figure of Kamala Harris sitting squarely behind him. And, in spite of the shonky pacing of his speech, Biden’s delivery still has the power to soothe. On Tuesday night, he slipped momentarily out of a more uniform style into full twinkle mode, saying twice over, and with sufficient theatre to make it sound as if he was half-addressing himself, “we’re going to be OK, we’re going to be OK”. If it was hokey to some and empty to others, something about the audacity of whimsy worked for me. Photos of Rihanna in a “pregnancy thong” – a sheer black neglige beneath which the antithesis of big pregnancy pants are clearly visible – flash round the world midweek after her appearance for Dior in Paris, and are universally received by the fashion press as wonderful. Rih’s pregnancy look is, says Glamour, “to be applauded”. Vogue.com calls it “sensational”. She has “redefined pregnancy style”, gushes BuzzFeed. Kneejerk fawning aside – Rihanna could have shown up in wardrobe from the Crucible to be met with exactly the same response – it seems to me that, rather than 4in heels and fishnets, a more radical choice may have been to rock up in a velour tracksuit and flats, gnawing on a foot-long sandwich from Subway, and begging everyone’s pardon for occasional pregnancy flatulence. But that would never do, would it? In among the horror, it’s useful to remember there was good news this week. The Queen recovered from Covid, great news for the Queen, and also for shift journalists braced for all-leave-cancelled had the outcome been different. The beloved children’s author Shirley Hughes died at the age of 94, not good news, obviously, but it did lead to the internet being flooded with images that are stamped on our hearts. There were Alfie and Annie Rose, a reminder of what the mess and beauty of childhood should look like. And after an experiment lasting several years, Amazon announced it would be closing all 68 of its bricks and mortar stores, those ersatz bookshops in which titles were grouped according to how many ratings they had garnered on Amazon.
