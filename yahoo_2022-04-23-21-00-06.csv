4/23/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Saturday it plans to deploy its newly tested Sarmat intercontinental ballistic missiles, capable of mounting nuclear strikes against the United States, by autumn. The target stated by Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one as Russia reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and Western military experts say more will be needed before the missile can be deployed. The Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys, and of striking targets thousands of miles away in the United States or Europe. This week's test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the United States and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Rogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) east of Moscow. He said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save ""colossal resources and time"". The launch of the ""super-weapon"" was an historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia's children and grandchildren for the next 30-40 years, Rogozin added. Western concern at the risk of nuclear war has increased since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 with a speech in which he pointedly referred to Moscow's nuclear forces and warned that any attempt to get in Russia's way ""will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history."" ""The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last month.

4/23/2022,"The UK is reportedly due to send Ukraine Stormer armored vehicles. The vehicle launches Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles which can shoot down jets and helicopters. The Stormers are being deployed to Ukraine along with 120 personnel carriers. The UK plans to send armored anti-aircraft vehicles to Ukraine, The Times of London reported. The Stormer vehicles launch 17 high-velocity Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, which can destroy planes and helicopters. Starstreak is Britain's most advanced operated portable missile system, and the UK sent a consignment to Ukraine in March. The missiles are laser-guided and split into three darts, which have a range of up to seven kilometers, according to The Times. A video from early April appeared to show the Starstreak missile in action, shooting down a Russian helicopter. However, until now, Ukraine has only been able to fire the British missiles using shoulder launchers or portable stands, The Times said. The 13.5-tonne Stormer vehicles are easier to operate, the paper said, and Ukrainian forces will be able to speed to locations at 50mph, fire the missile, and then leave. The vehicle operates with a crew of three â€” a driver, commander, and gunner. Sources told The Sun that ""a handful of Stormers"" will be deployed to Ukraine alongside 120 personnel carriers. It can be loaded onto C-17 transport planes and flown to Ukraine in days, The Sun said. The provision of Stormers to Ukraine has not been officially announced, but The Sun reported that Defence Secretary Ben Wallace would be making a statement in parliament this week. ""It is no secret that the UK has committed to helping Ukraine with its anti-air capabilities,"" a source told the paper. The Ministry of Defence hosted a Ukrainian government delegation at the Salisbury Plain Training Area two weeks ago and is said to have demonstrated the technology, The Times said. The move marks a significant increase in heavy weaponry to Ukraine from Britain as Russia continues with its offensive in the Donbas region. So far, Western governments have only sent Ukraine shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles to defend against Russian forces. ""The Stormer-Starstreak combination will boost Ukraine's fighting capability,"" Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British troops in Afghanistan, told The Times. ""It is an extremely effective, highly mobile combat vehicle that will do severe damage to any attempts at low-level attack by Putin's air force."" However, Kemp told the paper that the move is likely to anger Moscow, which has already expressed displeasure with the West for sending weapons to Ukraine. British special forces are also believed to be training local troops in Kyiv for the first time since Russia's invasion, Ukrainian commanders told The Times of London. The British soldiers have reportedly trained Ukrainian troops to use NLAWs, British-supplied anti-tank missiles.
