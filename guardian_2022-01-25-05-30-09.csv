1/25/2022,"England’s Six Nations preparations have been rocked by further significant disruption with Courtney Lawes sidelined due to a head injury and Eddie Jones delaying a decision on who will replace the absent Owen Farrell as captain. In another major blow, Jonny May has pulled out of the squad with a knee injury. Jones was expected to name a new captain on Monday and while England have confirmed that Farrell will miss their opening match against Scotland at the very least – meaning a recall for George Ford – no replacement skipper has been announced. Lawes was the heavy favourite, having stood in successfully during the autumn, but he is now unable to take part in key preparations at England’s training camp in Brighton this week as he undergoes the head injury return-to-play protocols. It is understood Tom Curry will fulfil media duties at the Six Nations launch this week in his role as one of the side’s vice-captains.  With Farrell due to this week discover if he will feature at any stage of the tournament, Jones has summoned Ford while Elliot Daly comes into the squad for May and Nick Isiekwe is added to the group in Brighton as injury cover for Lawes, who faces a race against time to prove his fitness for the Scotland match. May will also miss England’s trip to Murrayfield, and potentially the following match against Italy, with England said to be planning for life without him for the early stages of the tournament. His absence is a setback for Jones given the Gloucester wing has started every England match – barring the two developmental matches against the USA and Canada last summer – since the 2019 World Cup. May’s withdrawal means a recall for Daly, who missed the autumn campaign through injury and was left out of the squad last week. Ford, meanwhile, comes in for Farrell having been dropped last autumn. He has been in exceptional form for Leicester this season but was again omitted from the initial Six Nations squad, only for Farrell’s ankle injury setback to hand him a reprieve. Jones has been impressed by Isiekwe’s form for Saracens this season and he also earns a call-up, having won the last of his three caps in the summer of 2018. Lawes was left out of the Northampton team to face Racing 92 over the weekend – a fixture that was subsequently cancelled – but Saints were confident that he would be fine for England’s Six Nations campaign. Nonetheless, his inability to train this week is a problem for Jones given Farrell is absent, and it could develop into a crisis for the head coach if Lawes suffers a setback when progressing through the protocols.",Sport/Sport,Injuries to Courtney Lawes and Jonny May hit England’s Six Nations plans,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/24/injuries-to-courtney-lawes-and-jonny-may-hit-england-six-nations-plans
1/25/2022,"Jeopardy! contestant Amy Schneider could again break records this week. Schneider, an engineering manager from Oakland, California, could score her 39th win on Monday night’s episode, giving her the second longest winning streak of any contestant. Since November, she has won about $1.3m, making her the first woman and fourth person to win more than $1m on the show. She has also become the first transgender person to qualify for Jeopardy’s Tournament of Champions, an annual event with the game’s top players.  The 42-year-old has managed to answer 95% of questions correctly, according to Jeopardy!. If she wins Monday, Schneider would surpass Matt Amodio’s victory streak and have the second highest number of consecutive victories of any contestant, behind Ken Jennings, whose 74-game streak is the longest in the show’s history. Schneider, who is originally from Dayton, Ohio, has chronicled her experience on the show on social media, detailing the techniques she uses to tackle questions and recall facts as well as which questions stumped her. “While I still don’t necessarily understand why I tended to improve as the game went on, it had happened enough for me to start to have some faith in it,” she said of the most recent episode. Schneider’s victory streak and social media posts have endeared her to Jeopardy! fans and made her a beacon for LGBTQ+ visibility. Schneider has said she had dreamed of being a contestant on the show since age five, and told Good Morning America on Monday that representing the trans community on the show has been the most rewarding part of her experience. “I think that the best part for me has been being on TV as my true self, expressing myself and representing the entire community of trans people,” she said. “Just being a smart, confident woman and doing something super normal like being on Jeopardy!”",News/Media,Jeopardy! contestant Amy Schneider looks to continue historic winning streak,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/24/jeopardy-amy-schneider-winning-streak-record
1/25/2022,"Good morning. It’s been two years today since the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in Australia. Since then, there have been more than 1.6m infections and more than 3,000 deaths, with many of those taking place in the current Omicron outbreak. The surge has caused shortages of rapid tests, which are causing stress for vulnerable people and has come at a difficult time for the return to school. In the aged care sector, some facilities are telling essential visitors to find their own rapid tests or be denied entry. Meanwhile, our economics correspondent, Peter Hannam, looks at whether Australia debt-fuelled pandemic finance party is finally over. A 1,700km rail route between Melbourne and Brisbane has been promised by the Coalition to deliver an economic boom for Australia’s regions and rural communities. But four years after the project (worth $14.5bn and counting) was announced, just 130km of track has been laid and we are still unsure of where it will exactly start and finish. A major Guardian investigation examines the mega project to find out whether communities along its route will benefit and whether their concerns are being bypassed.  Australians in Ukraine are being urged to leave the country immediately as a Russian invasion appears increasingly likely. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Monday night raised its advice to “Do Not Travel” and urged Australians to leave now by commercial means as flight availability could change or be suspended at short notice. Nato is reinforcing its eastern borders with land, sea and air forces, and the US is considering the deployment of thousands more troops to the region, as fears grow of a possible “lightning” attack by Russia to seize the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the “deteriorating security situation” had driven the military alliance to bolster its “collective defence”. Dfat’s advice comes as family members of Australian diplomats prepare to depart Kyiv. It follows similar moves by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Aboriginal flag now “belongs to everyone” after the federal government bought the emblem’s copyright in a $20m deal. The deal includes payment to designer Harold Thomas and terminates commercial licences, which had limited the reproduction of the symbol. “In reaching this agreement to resolve the copyright issues, all Australians can freely display and use the flag to celebrate Indigenous culture,” said Ken Wyatt, the federal minister for Indigenous Australians. “Now that the commonwealth holds the copyright, it belongs to everyone, and no one can take it away.” Scott Morrison enters a federal election year with his approval languishing at levels not seen since March 2020, and the Coalition’s handling of the Omicron wave may have swayed some voters away, according to the the first Guardian Essential poll of the year. Anthony Albanese will open the election year with a new $440m pitch to help schools manage the challenges of the pandemic, promising new grant funding for better ventilation, building upgrades and mental health services. Nearly half of all people who sought help with homelessness last year in NSW did not get it, a new report has shown. Unmet demand for homelessness services is up 10 percentage points from five years ago in NSW and Queensland but has dropped in Victoria, according to a Productivity Commission report. The UK prime minister is facing new allegations of another party at No 10 during lockdown, this time for Boris Johnson’s birthday party. Carrie Johnson threw the surprise birthday party during the first lockdown, despite the rules forbidding social gatherings indoors, according to broadcaster ITV. Downing Street has admitted the prime minister attended the gathering in the cabinet room at No 10 with up to 30 people at 2pm on 19 June 2020, but denied reports he held a birthday party later in the Downing Street residence. Social gatherings indoors at the time were banned, with people permitted only to meet outside in groups of up to six people. The revelations about parties at No 10 during lockdown have sparked widespread anger and now threaten the PM’s leadership as a number of Tory MPs plot against him. The former pope Benedict XVI has admitted providing false information to a German inquiry into clerical sexual abuse. The former pontiff blames an editorial “oversight” for a previous statement that he was absent from a 1980 meeting over a suspected paedophile priest. One person was shot dead and three others were injured after a man opened fire in a lecture hall in the German university town of Heidelberg. The gunman, a student carrying several firearms, also died during the attack. Julian Assange will be able to go to the supreme court in the UK to challenge a decision allowing him to be extradited to the US to face espionage charges. But the supreme court will have to decide whether or not it should hear his challenge. There’s almost always a profound reason someone chooses to take up a combat sport as an adult, Jenny Valentish learns at a women’s Muay Thai retreat in Victoria. “Many of the women here were drawn to Muay Thai for the feeling of confidence that a combat sport can provide, particularly sparring, which Rangkla and La introduce unusually early on, believing that if well supervised it doesn’t have to be daunting.” Paul Kelly barely remembers what he played on stage at his most memorable gig. What he does remember is the goosebumps and the crowd stunned into silence after Archie Roach sang Took the Children Away. “I was watching from the side – I had goosebumps and the hairs went up on the back of my neck as he sang it, to dead silence from the audience. He finished the song and there was still dead silence … I’d never seen it before – people were so stunned at the end of the song that it took them a while just to gather themselves to applaud.” The Red Cross’s Lifeblood program is chalking up a record number of no-shows, with half of the nation’s blood donation appointments going unattended. “We need 140,000 new blood donors in 2022 to meet the needs of patients across Australia, an increase of 45%,” Lifeblood’s executive director of donor services, Cath Stone, said. “Our existing donors can’t do it alone.” It takes only 10 minutes to donate the standard 470ml of blood that can save up to three lives.

I wasn’t prepared to stand by and let that happen.” The Matildas have maintained their perfect start to the Women’s Asian Cup with a 4-0 win over the Philippines, securing safe passage to the quarter-finals in the process. Two-thirds of South Australia’s government teachers have voted to strike on the first full face-to-face return to school next Wednesday to protest a lack of Covid planning, reports the Advertiser.

1/25/2022,"After a result like Tottenham’s 2-0 Premier League defeat by Chelsea it is commonplace to turn the focus on the manager and, goodness knows, Antonio Conte had offered the ammunition. There was a new 4-4-2 starting system from the Spurs manager, featuring full-backs in front of full-backs and not much creativity in central midfield. The messages appeared everywhere. There was no Sergio Reguilón, despite the overload of full-backs – or Emerson Royal, for that matter. They would kick their heels on the bench. But at least they were inside the stadium, which is more than could be said of Tanguy Ndombele, Giovani Lo Celso and Dele Alli.  Ndombele was last seen walking off at low speed upon his substitution in the FA Cup win over Morecambe on 9 January and, as such, is the founder member of Conte’s bomb squad. Lo Celso and Alli have been added, with the former making clear on Instagram he was 100% fit. Alli’s social media move involved him uploading a silly video to TikTok during the game, which he later deleted. Conte felt he had needed to try something different after his team’s losses to Chelsea in both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final and the first half went relatively well. Spurs settled after a shaky start and, with Steven Bergwijn showing a couple of flashes on the counter, they were unlucky to see a Harry Kane goal ruled out for a soft foul on Thiago Silva. Chelsea, though, would make their class tell after the interval and, in the final analysis, Conte’s team had offered little as an attacking force and been a clear second best. It would not be difficult to imagine the reaction to such a Spurs performance under José Mourinho or Nuno Espírito Santo. But the point is that Conte is living a honeymoon period in which his many good results are down to his coaching genius, his drive to instil an obsessive winning mentality, and the defeats are evidence of why the squad is not good enough. Or, to put it another way, why the chairman, Daniel Levy, has to spend some money during the transfer window. Conte has created this climate, first and foremost, by being who he is and doing what he does. The serial winner inherited a team whose confidence was low and who had lost five of 10 league games under Nuno. Conte’s record shows six wins, three draws and now one defeat in the competition. The structure he has put in place has proved effective and, with the fans firmly behind him, there are hopes – previously non-existent – of a top-four finish this season. But the Spurs manager has turned the screw, building on his reserves of credit via his media messaging which has, at no point, been particularly complimentary about what he has found. At many other times, especially after the losses – remember NS Mura in the Europa Conference League? – Conte has been scathing about the level of the squad. This is what the Italian does. He starts fires, he stokes creative tensions. He questions everything, he suggests that nothing is ever just right – even Tottenham’s magnificent training ground and stadium which, he has hinted, might just be too good. To Conte, the club’s situation is connected to poor recruitment, the failure to properly replace players such as Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen, Mousa Dembélé and Christian Eriksen, who he remembers from when he first came to England for 2016-17. In that season, he led Chelsea to the title; Spurs were competitive runners-up under Mauricio Pochettino. Conte’s key lieutenants played in that team, too – Hugo Lloris, Eric Dier, Son Heung-min and Kane – and it is a macabre game for the Spurs support to name the successful major signings since then. Lucas Moura, Pierre-Emile Højbjerg. Who else? The manager sees better recruitment as part of the way back up and so here we are, him loading the pressure on Levy and plenty of rubbernecking from elsewhere, not least at Chelsea. The board there grew used to hearing Conte describe himself as “just a coach” and how it was “up to the club to make the final decisions”. He has trotted out that line a few times at Spurs and it has always sounded like a threat. The economics are hugely challenging for Levy, especially with regard to Ndombele and Lo Celso, massive money signings whose values have slumped. A loan move would make sense for the former, mainly to reboot him, with Paris Saint-Germain pushing, and it could also be the case for the latter. Newcastle have an interest in taking Alli on loan. Spurs are confident of signing Adama Traoré from Wolves, who would appear a prototype Conte player. But what now for Bergwijn, who marked his return from injury last Wednesday with the dramatic late goals to earn the 3-2 win at Leicester? Ajax want to sign him permanently. Meanwhile, Tottenham’s need for a creative central midfielder and an extra striker is clear. Conte has such faith in his work that he believes he can engineer a top-four finish but there is no doubt he would feel more confident with a little help in the January market. Conte will always be restless. The coming week promises to be fraught.",Sport/Football,Firestarter Conte turns up heat on Levy by demanding Spurs signings | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/24/antonio-conte-turns-up-heat-daniel-levy-by-demanding-spurs-signings
1/25/2022,"Jeremy Grantham’s warning that share prices are heading for a mighty fall is just part of the new year financial calendar, say his critics. On this occasion, however, the British co-founder of Boston-based fund manager GMO and highly regarded observer of stock market bubbles, may have got his timing spot-on. Certainly “Let the Wild Rumpus Begin” was a terrific title for Grantham’s piece last week: a rumpus is roughly what we’re seeing, at least if one looks at the US, where the technology-heavy Nasdaq has lost 16% since the start of January. It was clobbered so severely on Monday that even the UK’s FTSE 100 index, a decidedly non-tech collection of stocks, was obliged to react to the apparent shift in investor sentiment. The Footsie lost 187 points, or 2.6%, even if a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine was also in the mix.  Grantham’s thesis is that US stocks are in a “superbubble”, an upgrade on last year’s diagnosis of “an epic bubble”, and that the US has seen only three other such extreme events in the past 100 years – the Wall Street crash of 1929, the turn-of-the-millennium dotcom mania and the housing market madness of 2006. He ran through his checklist of a late-stage bubble, of which “the most important and hardest to define” is “the touchy-feely characteristic of crazy investor behaviour”. On that score, he has hard-to-dispute examples: the meme stock merriness of a year ago; dogecoin, a parody cryptocurrency, rising to a value of $90bn “because Elon Musk kept joking about it”; and shares in car hire firm Hertz soaring because the company said it would order some Teslas. Those episodes are now over, reckons Grantham, and we’re on to “the vampire phase” of the bull market. Share prices have defied Covid, the end of quantitative easing and the promise of higher rates but, “just as you’re beginning the think the thing is completely immortal, it finally, and perhaps a little anticlimactically, keels over and dies”. It’s strong stuff and there are, of course, counter-arguments. Corporate earnings are not, on the whole, collapsing. The easing of the Omicron variant may shift western consumers away from consumption of goods and towards spending on services, which could take the edge off current inflation worries. The end of the era of ultra-loose monetary conditions could still be gradual. On the other hand, one should also remember Grantham’s warning a year ago that great bull markets can turn down when the conditions are still favourable – they just have to be “subtly less favourable than they were yesterday”. Therein lies the debate over whether we’re seeing the removal of some puffed-up extreme over-valuations in corners of the US tech market – think Netflix and Peloton last week – or the start of wider declines for stock markets, fuelled by inflationary problems in energy and food. Grantham’s argument, note, isn’t just that US shares are over-priced; he also includes US houses (“at the highest multiple of family income ever”) and bonds too. It’s the simultaneous nature that, in his view, makes the bubbles so dangerous. He isn’t always right, but he is a serious student of markets who called the dotcom and 2006-08 crashes with impressive precision. He’s worth listening to. Ukraine aside, the debate he is describing is exactly the one obsessing investors currently. The test of his thesis has been a long time coming. Unilever, up 7%, defied the gloom as it continued to be a one-company news machine. The latest development is Nelson Peltz, fearsome US activist investor at Trian Partners, taking a stake, reported the FT. The consumer goods industry is territory Peltz knows well from campaigns at Procter & Gamble and Mondelez. The hard part is guessing what he might want – there’s bound to be something. Possibilities range from a break-up, meaning the sale of Unilever’s food division, to a simple request that the company run its current operations better. Whatever it is, “the fox would now appear to be inside the henhouse”, as Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo put it. An open question, though, is whether the fox will want a seat on the board. Peltz secured that position at P&G. To put it mildly, it would not be Unilever’s usual style to offer a directorship to an aggressive outsider. Allowing the activist to force a vote on the matter would be risky, however. In their current mood, shareholders may give the wrong answer.",News/Business,"If Jeremy Grantham is talking about a US ‘superbubble’, we should listen",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/24/if-jeremy-grantham-is-talking-about-a-us-superbubble-we-should-listen
1/25/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg has announced his social media empire is building what he claims is the world’s fastest artificial intelligence supercomputer as part of plans to build a virtual metaverse. The Facebook founder said in a blogpost that the metaverse, a concept that blends the physical and digital world via virtual and augmented reality, will require “enormous” computing power. The AI supercomputer, dubbed AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) by Zuckerberg’s Meta business, is already the fifth fastest in the world, the company said.  “The experiences we’re building for the metaverse require enormous compute [sic] power (quintillions of operations / second!) and RSC will enable new AI models that can learn from trillions of examples, understand hundreds of languages, and more,” wrote Zuckerberg in a blogpost. Meta researchers added that they expected the RSC to become the fastest computer of its kind when it is completed in the summer. AI mimics the underlying architecture of the brain in computer form and is capable of processing, and spotting patterns in, vast amounts of data. Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and the WhatsApp messaging service, generates significant amounts of data from its 2.8 billion daily users. It was fined $5bn for privacy violations in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee and whistleblower, has warned that the company is focusing on expansion into new areas when it should be putting “more resources on very basic safety systems”. The Meta researchers said the RSC, which is built from thousands of processors and housed in an undisclosed location, would help identify harmful content on its platforms. However, the metaverse, which Meta admits is still years away from being a fully fledged concept, is a key part of the company’s plans for the computer. In the blogpost the researchers – Kevin Lee, a technical program manager at Meta, and Shubho Sengupta, a software engineer, said they expected the supercomputer to immediately translate conversations between gamers from different countries. The Meta employees said it could allow large groups of people around the world to play a game based on augmented reality, where a digital layer is put over reality, normally via a user’s phone, although special headsets and glasses are in development at companies like Apple and the owner of Snapchat. “We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” wrote the researchers. “Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform – the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role.” The researchers added that users’ data is end-to-end encrypted before being fed into the RSC. “Before data is imported to RSC, it must go through a privacy review process to confirm it has been correctly anonymised. The data is then encrypted before it can be used to train AI models,” said the researchers. Separately, the UK’s data watchdog is seeking clarification from Meta over parental controls on its popular virtual reality headset, the Oculus Quest 2, after research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a campaign group, flagged multiple instances of abuse on VRChat, a top-selling social app for Oculus user.",News/Technology,Mark Zuckerberg says Meta is building the world’s fastest supercomputer,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/24/mark-zuckerberg-says-meta-is-building-the-worlds-fastest-supercomputer
1/25/2022,"An actor has been fired from the Broadway production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child following a complaint about his conduct. James Snyder played Harry Potter in the Tony award-winning play, which was a huge success in London’s West End before transferring to Broadway, where it became the highest ever grossing non-musical in 2018.  Producers said they received a complaint against Snyder in November and immediately suspended him from the production, pending an independent investigation. Following the conclusion of that investigation, producers confirmed on Sunday that they had terminated his contract. The complaint is understood to have been made by the actor Diane Davis, who plays Ginny Potter, Harry Potter’s wife, in the show. Producers said they “received a complaint from Diane Davis regarding the conduct of fellow cast member James Snyder”, in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. Producers confirmed in November that Davis decided to take a leave of absence from the show. “We are committed to fostering a safe and inclusive workplace, which is why we have robust workplace policies and procedures in place for all those involved in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the statement by producers said. “This includes strict prohibitions against harassment in any form, as well as channels through which any employee can report conduct that they believe is inappropriate. We will continue to do all we can to ensure the extremely talented team that brings this production to life feels safe, empowered and fully supported.” Representatives for Snyder and Davis have been contacted for comment. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which picks up 19 years after JK Rowling’s final Potter novel left off, portrays the wizard and his friends as grown-ups, now with children of their own. Snyder’s name no longer features on the cast and creative list of the Broadway show’s website. The actor has appeared in other Broadway productions such as Cry-Baby, If/Then and In Transit, as well as in TV shows including The Good Wife, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Drop Dead Diva.",News/US news,James Snyder fired from Harry Potter play on Broadway after conduct complaint,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/24/james-snyder-fired-from-harry-potter-play-on-broadway-after-conduct-complaint
1/25/2022,"Cooper Raiff has a serious problem with titles. The intimidatingly talented multi-hyphenate made his first film at the age of 22, a warm and revelatory college-set comedy that was unfortunately called Shithouse, a title so head-scratchingly awful that it was renamed Freshman Year for its UK release. But as bad as that might have been, and it didn’t stop the film from winning a major award at SXSW and garnering a string of deservedly enthused reviews, he’s somehow managed to outdo himself with his follow-up, the excruciatingly named Cha Cha Real Smooth, a title so skin-crawlingly heinous, it appears that perhaps he’s simply trolling us. It’s also, sadly, a much weaker film, a sickly-sweet disappointment from someone whose first feature suggested that he might be the new Richard Linklater but it turns out that instead, he might just be the new Zach Braff …  What’s most frustrating about the slide from Shithouse to here is that what had previously felt genuine and raw now feels rather false and self-conscious. With a bigger budget and bigger names, Raiff has created something that feels too primed to please and too eager to be loved, a calculated Sundance movie made for a Sundance crowd, far from a disaster but even farther from the highs of his debut. Raiff, acting as writer, director and star yet again, plays Andrew, a 22-year-old moving back home after college, trying to find his place in the adult world. His job at Meat Sticks is as unfulfilling as it sounds and after taking his younger brother to a bat mitzvah, he quickly discovers a skill he wasn’t aware he had and a profession he hadn’t thought of. His new job as bar and bat hype man brings him closer to a local mother (Dakota Johnson) and her autistic daughter who he starts babysitting for. Cha Cha Real Smooth could almost be a straight sequel to Shithouse, a film that saw a socially awkward student find his tribe and his voice. Now it’s a recent graduate figuring out what to do next and it’s clear that Raiff is a writer most comfortable drawing, albeit loosely, on his own experiences. There’s definite detail in his writing that’s often missing from similar what-am-I-gonna-do-with-my-life indies but not enough to truly distinguish it, vital in such an overstuffed sub-genre. There’s not a beat or a character here who will surprise you, sadly least of all Andrew, an edgeless, puppyish saint we’re expected to fall for from the outset without Raiff’s writing or performance really earning such unwavering adulation. Raiff has written himself as a nice guy who does nice things and everyone says nice things about (in one scene, Johnson laughably tells him: “You know what you look like right now? You look like the sweetest person ever”) which is extremely limiting both for Andrew and the film. Bar a handful of forgivably impetuous reactions, he’s essentially blemish-free, charming virtually everyone around him. It makes for a protagonist who has nowhere of interest to really go and so the film is stuck in its tracks along with him. Raiff’s gangly, floppy-haired charm, which held almost every frame of Shithouse, is far less effective here, a little too self-assured perhaps, but there’s another great turn from Johnson, who responds to his dialed up life-of-the-party shtick with a more subdued and thoughtful performance, giving the film its heart, beating quietly in the background (there’s barely any time for her How to be Single sister Leslie Mann, playing Raiff’s mother, with a dead-ended story about mental health). An all-too-brief one-scene turn from Saint Frances’ Kelly O’Sullivan only serves to remind us how she also wrote and starred in a what-am-I-gonna-do-with-my-life indie that also involved a confused slacker caring for kids but achieved all of the genuine emotional highs that this one can’t touch. At a young age, Raiff still remains an exciting up-and-coming film-maker of note and even in his sophomoric slump, there’s enough, coupled with his standout debut, to suggest that better things will come. Hopefully better titles too.
