3/10/2022,"The John Lewis Partnership has restored its staff bonus after narrowing losses to £26m last year. The department store group, which is staff-owned and also operates Waitrose supermarkets, said it would pay a 3% bonus to workers, equivalent to 1.5 weeks pay. A year ago it said it would not be paying a bonus to staff, known as partners as they jointly own the company via a trust, for the first time in 67 years and was unlikely to pay a bonus this year after slumping to a £517m loss for 2020. JLP also said it would pay all partners at least the independently verified living wage of £9.90 across the UK, a 2% pay rise. Sharon White, the chairman, said on Thursday: “With our partners, like the whole country, facing a cost of living squeeze, we believe that this is the right time to pay the voluntary real living wage, nationwide.” The company said it was investing £54m in additional pay excluding bonus. The improved deal for workers came after John Lewis said sales rose 1% to £12.5bn in 2021. The John Lewis department stores increased sales to £4.9bn, its highest level. Sales at established Waitrose stores rose 1%, helping lift the total to £7.5bn for the grocery chain.",News/Business,John Lewis restores staff bonus as losses narrow,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/10/john-lewis-restores-staff-bonus-losses-narrow-department-store
3/10/2022,"There is no better time to go for a run than 5am. Especially in March. Two or three mornings a week at the moment, I edge out of bed, creep down the stairs and stand fully naked in the kitchen. The curtains are closed and there’s nobody awake to see me anyway. Then I change into my running things – out of earshot of my partner and sleeping son – and, turning the front door as quietly as I can, slip out. Stepping into the inky blue dark, I am hit by a cold that is almost more of a taste than a temperature. Still warm from my bed, I meet the soft, earthy tang of dew and mist and soil. A few stars hang in the night sky above. My neighbours’ windows are drawn closed; like eyelids. I am entirely alone. Well, nearly. The magic of an early morning run is also that, even in a city, you can flush out unsuspecting wildlife. Muntjac deer, rabbits, foxes and cats scatter as I turn out of our little estate, run through a nature reserve or across the park. Along the river I hear the hooting of barn owls. Bats swivel through the sky above my head. As a woman running through the city in the dark before dawn, I feel safe. No, I feel determined to feel safe. Other runners say bright and breezy good mornings or hellos as we pass each other on the towpath or in the gaps between streetlights. I pass men and women, in headscarves and puffa jackets, walking into town to start their shifts. Occasionally, sweaty and wearing a bumbag, I pass groups of students, listing down the centre of the road like ships buffeted by high winds, sliding down from the summit of a night out. At five in the morning, there are few cars on the road, making the air sweet, the world quiet, the hills and asphalt mine to explore. You don’t get that at 11am or 3pm or, God forbid, in a gym. If there is a danger in this situation, it is not me. I have the right to be outside, in the dark, moving my body, breathing steam. Nobody has the right to hurt, bother, hassle, intimidate or harm me. So I take up space. I get out there. I wave to other women running as a show of solidarity and mutual reassurance. The dark and the outdoors is ours.

3/10/2022,"In 2002, the BBC launched a scrappy new radio station, aimed at highlighting its massive archive of live music sessions, “on a thing called DAB, which no one had really heard of”, says early morning presenter Chris Hawkins. Twenty years on, 6 Music is the biggest digital station in the UK, with 2.6 million listeners. It survived a serious threat of closure in 2010. Its audience has grown up with it (breakfast show host Lauren Laverne even DJed at the wedding of a couple who met discussing the station). The presence of independent acts that it championed such as Dry Cleaning and Yard Act in the UK album chart – and Little Simz winning a Brit award – reflects its impact. But a lot has changed in 20 years. 6 Music positions itself as “beyond the mainstream” – but indie and alternative music have become central to British culture: while 1.5 million people applied to attend Wimbledon this year, 2.5 million tried for Glastonbury tickets. The independent music scene has become markedly more diverse, and music fandom is no longer the sole preserve of the young. Taylor Swift collaborates with the National now. Is 6 Music too cosy to reflect these shifts? And how does it handle change when – as they discovered when DJ Shaun Keaveny left last September – many of its listeners would quite like things to remain exactly the same? That tension speaks to its place in its loyal listeners’ lives. 6 Music became a lifeline for many during the pandemic, and its role will surely continue, licence fee cuts not withstanding. I spoke to Laverne on the morning Russia invaded Ukraine. “Days like today are a challenge because people wake up feeling anxious, sad, overwhelmed,” she said. “They need us to be a soft place to land.” Chris Hawkins, presenter I was part of planning the station. It was about filling a gap somewhere between Radio 1 and Radio 2 – there was a market for music lovers who weren’t being catered for by those stations. Steve Lamacq, presenter The Radio 1 Evening Session was ending in 2003 and I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. Then 6 Music got in touch. I was excited that somebody wanted to put us on air because my morale was quite low. Here was somebody saying: “Do you want to do three hours of radio, old records, new records, and basically get on with it?” It was incredibly liberating. Hawkins At first it didn’t really feel like a proper radio station. We had one on-air studio, one production studio and a kitchenette. In the early days, you could hear the photocopier whirring. I always remember John Peel wandering around the same corridors and that had a certain magic about it. Lamacq John Sugar, who ran the station, would always say: “Dig deeper.” That was the catchphrase. Don’t just play Love Will Tear Us Apart. Gilles Peterson, presenter At first I thought 6 was like old-school Radio 1 at night, very indie – with massive admiration for all those broadcasters, I’m just from another space. I thought the audience would think of me as a bit dancey – “Oof, jazz, not sure about that”. But it was a natural platform for me to be able to do what I do best. Lamacq On Sunday we had a weekly phone call with Richard Hawley called “Hawley’s hangover cures”, then he would choose some completely obscure rockabilly record. Shaun Keaveny, former presenter There was a period when it was very comedy-focused – Russell Howard, Jon Richardson, Russell Brand and Adam and Joe – and I think they drifted too far towards that for a little while. Lamacq When Lauren Laverne joined about 18 months before the threat of closure, that’s when we really worked out what we were doing. We were far more accessible. The danger was that in the early days, it was like you weren’t allowed in unless you knew the catalogue numbers of the first 10 releases on Stiff Records. Hawkins And then, of course, came that sort of D-day. Matt Everitt, presenter It’s not a big station in terms of headcount. Why close us when we do something really distinct? Lamacq It was lucky we’d worked out what it was before someone tried to close us down, because when people listened in to see what it was, they found it quite enjoyable. Tom Ravenscroft, presenter Weirdly it was the best it had ever sounded. Maybe there was an element of: let’s not give a fuck. There’s more of a punk attitude than perhaps there is when you get really popular. I felt like, if the ship was sinking, I wanted to be on it. I thought even if I could get a show on there for six months, I’d be happy. Everitt David Bowie was making statements, but there were also tens of thousands of people telling the powers that be: no, this is a mistake. And it survived. Keaveny It was a Lazarus story. And it was beautiful and the start of a huge love-in over many years. Ravenscroft: As things get more popular, they get less risky – “now this thing’s really popular, we don’t want to break that”. So I think naturally, things became a little less punk rock. Everitt At the start, the public perception was: it’s kind of indie. That wasn’t really true at the start, but over time that inclusivity has become more apparent. Samantha Moy, 6 Music head I want this station to be as representative of all music lovers as possible. We still play indie and alternative, that is part of our USP, but so is Sherelle and Little Simz. Lauren Laverne, presenter The breakfast show is traditionally described as the shop window of the station. When I started doing it I was keen that all the genres that have a place on 6 were represented in the show. I wanted to open the doors. Peterson I approach my show quite differently to all the other shows, in that I don’t have a script. I won’t even pick the first songs until seconds before the show starts sometimes. It’s a very volatile show, a bit like free jazz. Lamacq: I still get tons of actual post – vinyl and CDs, which I really delight in. If somebody has sent you a 7-inch single, you know how committed they are to their project. Lauren Brennan, music team editor Deciding what goes on the playlist is an enormous balancing act. We’re looking at the strength of the track, what we think will interest the audience, but also the playlist as a whole to make sure there’s a diversity of voices – that we’re representing as many genres as we can. Matthew Maxey, radio plugger 6 feels like a genuine meritocracy in that metrics like social media following, music video views have little to no influence on what gets played. An artist with a relatively small profile on a DIY label will be heavily supported and even playlisted if the song’s good enough. Simon Hallyday, 4AD 6 is a really important factor in how we set up a release in the UK. We speak to them early on and roughly tell them our plan and see if the timing works with their playlist. We will juggle [release] times so it’s convenient for the band and the station. They’re that important. Brennan A lot of it is gut instinct. When Wet Leg’s Chaise Longue was sent to us, we put that on the playlist straight away – it had barely any time on air to build but everybody in the team knew we had to play this now. Lamacq: If your record doesn’t go on and somebody else’s record does go on, it all boils down to: my band’s better than your band. It’s not malicious and it’s not overly competitive. But you feel the need to wave the flag. and if they take notice of somebody else’s flag this week, then next week, you’re going to come back with an even bigger flag. Jeff Bell, Partisan Records The success of Idles and Fontaines DC – and the fact that every other week now there is an artist in that [post-punk] vein appearing at the top end of the [album] charts – just goes to show how the work that someone like Steve has done has permeated wider music culture in the UK. James Smith, Yard Act 6 has managed to revive interest in new indie guitar music again by rebranding it as post-punk. Although us and our contemporaries may be bound by certain traits – semi-spoken lyrics and angular sounds – for the most part the bands coming through do sound completely different from each other. Scott Devendorf, the National 6 Music has been incredibly important for us – we grew up together over the past 20 years. Martin Mills, Beggars Group Does it affect what we sign? Exposure on 6 is a factor in what we can achieve – but the majors shape records to get on the radio. We make the records the artists want to make. Lamacq On average, just by email, I get 200 singles a week. And there are a lot of very generic records. You could get annoyed by it. But you can’t stop because something amazing will eventually come along. I listened to that Wet Leg single 19 times the day I got it. That’s what a teenager does. Laverne I think I was the first person to have Lizzo in session in this country, then you see her at Glastonbury or Little Simz at the Brit awards. It’s not like I would overstate it – they’re the artists, it’s all their own work – but to be able to share their music is so exciting. Peterson I’m discovering music from around the world but fitting that into the context of clubbing and electronic music. That taste has become more normalised now, so in a way my job is done. Moy John Peel’s spirit goes the whole way through 6. John played the cornerstones of 6 Music – Bowie, Nick Cave, PJ Harvey. But he was progressive, always looking out for the next thing. In his later years, it was White Stripes, DJ Scotch Egg, grime. I think you see that coming through with our presenters, and it felt like it showed how future-facing he was and how that spirit is still alive in pop culture. That’s one of my proudest commissions. Ravenscroft Everyone always makes this comparison between 6 Music and my dad, which I don’t personally see. Camilla Pia, assistant commissioner We did a Bowie season five years after his passing. I thought, how can we tell a story about Bowie that hasn’t been told a million times? We had a real range of voices on there, Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens. Simon Hallyday: 6 Music is so broad now that it’s harder for the artists who made the station to get back in there. That competition is a good thing. It’s part of how sustainable and flexible you can be. Lamacq When I started going to gigs in London at the end of the 80s, if you saw someone even over the age of 30, it was: “What are you doing here, Grandad?!” It’s not like that now. We’ve gone through a 20-year period where more and more people over 30, 40, 50 haven’t given up on music. That’s been part of our success story – it shows that we understand our audience, we’ve grown up together. Laverne I’m the daughter of a sociologist, so I find these social shifts fascinating. The generation gap between my dad and his parents was massive. Between me and my dad, it was much smaller. My 14-year-old has just cleared out my record collection of J Dilla, MF Doom and Wu-Tang, so it’s very small between us. Music’s not about age, it’s about attitude. Keaveny How much more growth is sustainable? Originally it was providing something that the big stations weren’t. How much bigger can you get before you’re just another one of the big ones? Jeff Smith, head of music When I joined in 2007, we had 500,000 listeners. We’ve got 2.6 million now. A lot of them have grown up with us – I don’t think we’ve lost an awful lot and I don’t think we’ve compromised. Lamacq I’ve been in the same spot since 2005. A member of management once said I was the Ken Bruce of 6 Music: solid, reliable, gets good figures, gets on with it; without Popmaster, but with new bands. Ravenscroft I was given the opportunity to learn on the job through nepotism, ultimately. I joined [in 2010] and then no one else joined for like, eight years. I was also the youngest DJ. It was kind of ridiculous. Laverne There was a time when I was the only woman on weekdays. It didn’t feel right. If you’re a public service broadcaster, it’s our job to reflect our audience. I was really pleased to see that change. Moy I wanted to get more music into the daytime. When I’m looking at any 6 presenter, I want to make sure that they have real authenticity. Shaun might not have been at the super sharp end of it but he put together a brilliant radio show that was absolute companionship. I wanted to try something different with him. Keaveny It was a small offering. Perhaps a weekend show, a couple of hours a week or something. Moy Ultimately it was his decision to leave. Keaveny They tried to persuade me to stay. I considered it for a while but I thought the brave thing to do was to step away. Keaveny: I would say this on air – I always felt like the dickhead at 6: the clown, the generalist rather than the specialist. I was the friendly guy giving out leaflets at the door. I was trying to entice people in and then they get hit over the head with serious music. I always thought it was possible to have both. It was possible because we did for a long time. Everitt I worked with Shaun for a long time. I love him dearly and I loved working on that show. The way we covered Bowie’s death [which Keaveny and Everitt announced live on air] has been talked about a fair amount – it’s one of the things I’m most proud of. Keaveny I had a little chat with Johnny Marr, because I know that he’d been through a lot – you leave a band like the Smiths then join about 75 other bands. He sent me a massive message that said: “Change is good. Don’t worry about it, don’t fear it.” What did I do after my last link? We went to [legendary Camden venue] the Dublin Castle and got unbelievably pissed, which is the only right way for a 6 Music presenter to leave the stage, really. Moy What was really important to me was having an authentic club culture show. 6 Music has been on air for a very long time and if you’re 45-plus, there’s a big chance you went clubbing. Having a show that can talk about Frankie Knuckles and go right through to Sophie’s legacy, helmed by the Blessed Madonna – that should absolutely be on 6 Music. And it was a question of when with Jamz Supernova. Afrodeutsche, presenter I was approached with the concept of the show and within a month Sam was welcoming me to the BBC. If I’d taken a breath I probably would have said no, because I didn’t know what I was embarking on. All I knew was I love music, and here’s an opportunity to share all the different types of music that I love: yes. Peterson There was an imbalance in terms of the background of a lot of the broadcasters and I think that they’ve certainly addressed that. Laverne It’s important for 6 to develop new talent and I’m such a big fan of the new people coming through. I want people who are going to give me a run for my money. This morning I was driving into work and Deb Grant on early breakfast was playing Virginia Astley, and I was like, wow, OK, here we go! Lamacq I don’t think I’ll still be there in my 70s. I have to go and see bands live, and I might be a bit knackered by then. Maybe there’ll be a day where I wake up and want to wear slippers and listen to trad jazz and that’ll be the end. But at the moment, particularly having had 18 months where we haven’t been able to do the job properly, trying to make sense of what we’ve got now is a challenge I’m enjoying. While I feel excited like that, I’ll carry on until they tell me to stop. Ravenscroft Where do 6 DJs go next? The gap between stations is really weird. For some presenters, the longer you’re at 6, the harder it is to go anywhere else. Afrodeutsche I didn’t realise until I started this show that my music knowledge is pretty deep. I thought I just loved music. It turns out I’m a massive nerd for detail, dates, how sonics change because of technology. I’d never claimed that before 6 made me see it. Laverne The pandemic was a big lesson in responding to how our audience was feeling and a huge illustration of things we instinctively knew about the importance of radio for mental health and wellbeing, the community aspect of what we do. Lamacq My wife’s a psychologist. She said: “Don’t keep referencing it, don’t say things like ‘We’re all in it together’. Be positive and don’t keep coming back to how terrible it is.” Afrodeutsche Listening to radio was really important for me because I live alone. It was like I had someone with me. Peterson I think I was the only show on the weekends that was going out live. I felt like I was needed, so I wanted to make sure I was on top form. I got into the habit of getting up and going for a big run, and that gave me the energy to get to the end of the show. Lamacq This time last year was the worst – cold, dark and wet. Just me and the producer on the other side of the glass. No one else on the floor at all. You had to go in early to do a temperature check but you couldn’t go into your studio until 15 minutes before you were on air, so there were 45 minutes where you were wandering the streets. That wasn’t the greatest, sitting outside Domino’s with a can of Coke and a packet of crisps. I’d occasionally treat myself to a cider. James Smith What’s happened with Yard Act over the last few years wouldn’t have happened without Steve Lamacq and 6 Music. It was people’s only access to us, because the live show didn’t exist, and we didn’t exist before lockdown. Laverne I fell into my job through having fun and doing TV jobs for shoe money back in the day. In my early 20s I thought, I want to do something meaningful with my life. And I find that side of what I do incredibly meaningful – this morning I had a lady on her way to a shift at Alder Hey children’s hospital saying thanks for cheering her up. That’s the other thing you’ve got to remember when there’s a big global event happening – people still have the challenges of their everyday lives, which can be really significant. I don’t want to overstate it because it’s also about having fun and just enjoying what you do. But it means a lot that we can make her morning a little bit nicer. Keaveny The BBC sometimes doesn’t understand how great it is at certain things. If you’re making live radio fit a non-live platform, you’re fucking up the live show. There aren’t enough people vocally championing the virtues of live radio without the bells and whistles. Lamacq There have been so many threats to linear radio over the last 20 years, like how people have been saying guitar music is dead since the days of the Haçienda. We will see as new generations come through whether they want radio in the same way. As long as radio never forgets how brilliant it is at being immediate and spontaneous, I think it will still exist. Moy It would be premature for me to speculate on the implications of any licence fee settlement. Lamacq The BBC, sometimes to its detriment, can move quite slowly. But in this case, I think the period of thought and reflection and consideration is probably the right thing. No one’s pushing alarm buttons. Moy What does the move to Manchester mean for 6? [By 2027, 60% of 6 Music production will come from Salford, a rise of 20% from current figures.] You want to represent all parts of the nation, because we’re paid for by the licence fee. What I’ve talked about in terms of [music] representation – it’s the same for the UK. It’s gonna be a real opportunity. Will there be big lineup changes? It’ll be a brilliant opportunity to think about what 6 will sound like, what voices it’ll have on it. When you think about what 6 sounds like now, Afrodeutsche’s based in Salford, Marc Riley, Craig Charles – they sound fantastic. So I’m not concerned. Peterson I really hope that the government get – and I think they do – the cultural imprint that music has. You wonder what Britain is about sometimes. Music is still really relevant and resonant. Laverne Every morning we wake up and there’s three hours of silence that we get to fill with whatever we like. Peterson I walk in there with my records on my back and I have this excited joy that I had when I was 16 going to my first pirate radio shows. Afrodeutsche We’re in Salford. We’re going live in 27 minutes. I’m shaking, taking deep breaths, wide eyes, looking at my producers and going: “It’s OK!” but not really knowing if it is – and then just going for it. Every Friday, as soon as we go live, we take the feed from London and there’s no going back. It’s like doing live gigs. It’s taken four months to not feel sick with nerves before doing the show, but I get it now. It’s just so much joy. The BBC Radio 6 music festival will take place in Cardiff from 1 to 3 April with highlights broadcast on 6 Music and BBC Sounds.

3/10/2022,"At the end of London fashion week last month, I wrote about how this season was going to be all about the return of the party dress. People like me hold up fashion to be a kind of divining rod for the coming public mood, so I think it is best to admit that I called that one spectacularly wrong. Just hours after Milan fashion week began, Russia invaded Ukraine. Coco Chanel once said that “fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening”. Great when the world is emerging from a pandemic and life is looking exciting again, and fashion can nurture feelings of hope and optimism by selling delicious new frocks as if they were chicken soup for the soul. Not so great once war breaks out. Military tailoring? I’ll pass, thanks. But it’s fair to say party dresses haven’t been flying off the shelves, either. Which made for a strange mood at fashion week. Tricky to pitch next season’s wardrobe as a fun thing to think about when the immediate future is quite so frightening. After a slow start, the fashion industry has shown up for Ukraine. From Chanel and Hermès to Zara and H&M, most brands have shuttered stores and paused online operations in Russia. LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, has pledged €5m (£4.2m) to the International Committee of the Red Cross, while Kering, which owns Gucci and Alexander McQueen, pledged an undisclosed “significant” donation to the United Nations Refugee Agency. The tone of Paris fashion week was, for the most part, sober and businesslike. Many of the collections were already scheduled to be shown in small presentations, because a catwalk show requires months of planning and only deep-pocketed luxury brands were in a position to take that kind of financial risk back in January, when the world was still spooked by Omicron. Paul Smith handed out cups of tea and cheese sandwiches as he explained how the new half-moon shaped shoulder pads he has developed for women’s tailoring offer a wearable take on the dramatic oversized tailoring that was all over the Milan catwalks. “It’s about respecting the female form,” he said. Having spent 16 weeks of 2020 working entirely alone in an office that usually houses hundreds – “just trying to keep the business going, which wasn’t easy, but we did it” – he enjoys the human scale of face-to-face walk-throughs these days. He has been working with stretch gaberdine to make suits more comfortable – which is what everyone wants now – but with construction that maintains the elegant line you get from tailoring. Dries van Noten rented a Parisian townhouse of decaying grandeur, with a sweeping staircase that creaked and handpainted wallpaper flaking from the walls, and filled it with vintage mannequins, which he dressed in lean zebra-print skirts over giraffe-striped boots, or quilted coats with shoulders as round as haloes. He wore a kingfisher-blue scarf wrapped around his neck against the chill of a house unoccupied for half a century as he showed his audience around, proudly pointing out tailoring details and embroidery techniques. The clothes were treasures, collectors’ items, but the bones of the looks – skirts over boots, poshed-up puffer coats – were quiet trends that recurred through the week.Quiet fashion might just be the next big thing. Not quiet as in dressed down and switched off, but quiet as in low-key. Perhaps this was coming anyway. Before this show season was overtaken by world events, the buzz was around the imminent return of Phoebe Philo, the British designer beloved during her time at Celine for her clothes, which were quirky enough to be cult and sophisticated enough to be chic. The likelihood of Philo’s own brand resetting the dial toward something cool-toned and subtle was somewhere in the field of vision of designers as they put together these collections over the winter, even if the sober mood of now was unforeseeable. Philo’s heralded return has not materialised, as yet; I suspect it’s on ice until the world is ready to care about such things again.What does quiet fashion look like? It’s a slightly too big blazer over a small, vaguely skimpy top – which could be a bra top, but could also be a knit vest, or a lace-trimmed camisole. The big-jacket, small-top look is a “but make it fashion” version of the plain old blazer over a shirt. Quiet fashion is a knee-high boot with a skirt, as I mentioned before, or a quilted coat. It is baggy jeans, which look like the next Y2K trend to go mainstream. It is checks of any kind, and loafers with everything, because preppy is the new streetwear. The colour of the season is the quietest of them all: brown. “This feels really strange, doesn’t it?” said Stella McCartney, one of the designers who did stage a proper show, backstage at the Pompidou Centre. “Doing a show when Covid was going on felt pretty strange, but this feels even stranger and sadder and more surreal.” Even though it is part of my job, sitting in front of a catwalk feels intensely uneasy right now, in a way that sitting in front of my laptop now does not. For many designers who were staging physical shows, it was their first time doing so since the pandemic began, and they were not minded, for that reason, to cancel, so they groped for some way of reaching across the chasm, to keep faith with the real world, with varying degrees of success. The mood of the show is about more than clothes, which is why many designers altered their soundtracks at the last minute. The Hungarian brand Nanushka played the Ukrainian national anthem; Valentino presaged the show with a voice note by its creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli, saying that he went ahead with his show – where the venue was painted hot pink, a specific new shade that will be added to Pantone’s official colour scale – because, he said, the collection represented work, and love.Rick Owens, who had been planning to play music by electronica artist Eprom, switched to the adagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony. He said he would normally think it too sentimental a choice, but felt it was “better suited for the sobriety and search for hope in our current condition”. The inflated, off-kilter jackets and slinky keyholed hooded robes, which were somehow both monastic and a bit S&M, were deeply strange but very beautiful. “During times of heartbreak, beauty can be one of the ways to maintain faith,” Owens said.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"‘Stranger, sadder and more surreal’: how the war in Ukraine transformed the fashion shows",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/10/stranger-sadder-surreal-covid-quiet-fashion-paris-milan-ukraine
3/10/2022,"On Monday, as the world watched the war in Ukraine intensify, Nikolai Plyuyko did something extraordinary. He went for an 11-kilometer run through the streets of Kyiv. Plyuyko has participated in 48 marathons in his lifetime. Before retiring, he worked as an engineer and served in the Soviet army. Today, Plyuyko is 75 years old and lives alone in what he describes as “a sleepy part of Kyiv”. Since war broke out, Plyuyko has maintained his schedule of daily outdoor runs, running around 150km in the past two weeks. He laughs when I ask him if he’s scared of running outside. “During my run, I often hear more than 10 explosions which are within a 20km distance,” he says stoically. “What’s the point of worrying? I’ve lived most of my life anyway.” The only two days that he didn’t go for a run were when Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, asked everyone to stay at home. “I want to show that we are a brave nation and that we aren’t afraid,” he says. “We want to be strong, not just with our minds, but with our bodies too.” Plyuyko has been greeting every person he sees on his run, trying to lift people’s spirits. “I wish them good health, hope and trust in the fight with the enemy. I tell them that we will win, that we just need to get through it.” As Russian forces continue to destroy Ukrainian cities, break ceasefire rules and kill civilians, Ukrainians are terrified. In Kyiv, most people stay at home or in shelters overnight and keep outdoor trips to a minimum. At the time of writing, the centre of Kyiv has experienced a slightly more stable period than the first few days of the war, when Russian airstrikes colored the city’s skyline. Still, sounds of heavy fighting reverberate around the city’s historic buildings. During the daytime, the atmosphere is suppressed but hopeful, with people going outside to the pharmacy, to get food in shops and markets or for a quick walk to move their bodies. Yet, against all odds, and potentially their own safety, a small group of older runners are still heading out every day in Kyiv, sometimes running as Russian bombs fall around them. Plyuyko runs in Natalka, a manicured public park that runs alongside the River Dnieper. In the last few days, he has even started going for a cold-water dip in the freezing temperatures of the river’s lagoon during his run. “I want to train myself to control my thermoregulation and find energy in my body.” The daily exercise has been helping him process the absurdity of an unexpected war on his doorstep. “I think about many things during the run,” he explains. “I think about everything I’ve lived through.” In the past week or so, Plyuyko has not only been running laps, but he has been running errands and getting groceries for people less mobile than him in his apartment complex. “I’ve been getting in line at the shop for them and running it to their homes. This is a sign of friendship during these hard times.” Locals have been happy to see him too; they call him “Uncle Kolya” and wave at him or sing him praise each time he passes them. According to Plyuyko, most of the people who have stayed behind are either the “lonely elderly” or those who are choosing to protect their towns and other people’s lives. He is one of Kyiv’s residents who has decided to stay in Ukraine to see the war through to the end. Just across town is Volodimir Shymko, a 67-year-old who has also been running to fill the city’s empty streets. “So many people have left Kyiv. I can tell which of our neighbours have stayed behind judging by whether their lights are on, and there are very few people who have stayed,” he tells me solemnly over the phone. Shymko, too, hopes that his running raises people’s morale. “I can’t go to fight at my age, there is an army for that, but we will see how the situation continues – maybe everyone will be forced to fight.” Konstantin Bondarev, 61, is based in the south of the city with his wife and two other friends who have come to shelter in his house. He has been running long-distance since 1983. “Now that there has been war, I’ve been running non-stop; it makes things feel a lot easier during such turbulent times,” he tells me. Since 24 February, he has clocked 73km in running distance. “Right now, thoughts of war keep going round and round in my head; from the moment you wake up, you start ringing all your friends, asking if everyone is alive and well over the messaging app Viber. When there are always attacks, you wonder if anyone has been bombed.” This, of course, has affected his nervous system, so the run has been helping him deal with the stress of the war. “When I run, I can put all that aside – at least for a moment.” In Ukraine, men between the ages of 18-60 have been banned from leaving the country in case they have to fight in the war, even if they have no military experience. “It’s important for people to show that we are alive and strong. This is our expression of the fight.” Shymko’s daughter and his grandson have fled to a part of the country that has now turned into a hotspot for Russian attacks. “They want to get out, but they can’t right now. I’m really worried about them; it’s a very grave situation.” Still, Shymko continues to run, in the past week, he has mustered 32km. The trained engineer, who is now a pensioner, has been a keen athlete since the 1970s. “I’ve run 40 marathons, and I’ve been in Berlin, Prague, Bratislava, Poland, Belgium, all around Ukraine.” And what would stop him? “Only if someone was to shoot at me multiple times,” he says macabrely. The Guardian discovered Plyuyko and Shymko’s routes on Strava – a fitness-oriented social network that uses GPS data to track movement and allows users to share it publicly. The collected data is also used to create heatmaps, which shows trails left behind by the app’s users, so much so, Strava accidentally uncovered numerous unmapped military bases in 2018. Calling the interviewees on Viber, the lines often went crackly, and Plyuyko, in particular, had trouble getting the app to work. “Can you hear me?” he would shout into the phone before hanging up multiple times. Eventually, we managed to set things up. I spoke to everyone in Russian, as it was the only language we had in common, and I later translated the interviews to English. Listening back through the recordings, I could hear how much the men I spoke to really wanted to tell the stories of their lives and their runs. With a real possibility of Russian occupation, they were worried that their histories would be overwritten. When I asked for photos, they sent me dozens of images, some taken now and some taken when they are looking much younger. A horrible thought occurred; did they think this might be one of the last chances to be heard and to be seen by the rest of the world? “It’s only natural to be scared when you’re running, and bombs are going off in the distance, going ‘boom’,” says Bondarev. “That does take the joy out of it.” On the day I spoke to him, he went on a run that started well but ended quite ominously. “When I ran out, nothing was going on initially, but then a military plane flew by and then by the end of my run, I saw smoke billowing out of something in the distance. I ran home and took a photo.” He says he’s begun to feel a little paranoid, being wary of the people he sees in the street, especially if he can’t recognise them. “Now you can’t help but wonder: ‘Who is this? Where are they from?’” However, his anxieties are temporarily assuaged when checking his Strava feed to see if his friends outside Kyiv are still running. This has become another source of confirmation that they are still there alive and well during turbulent times. “Strava has become an additional source of information for me – at this time, the data is the ultimate knowledge about someone’s wellbeing,” he says. Though internet connection and signal may be temperamental in Ukraine right now, knowing that his friends are still running is hugely affirming. “I will see that they have logged a workout and immediately I feel relief; though I do have a friend in Kharkiv who hasn’t posted about running online for a little while – it’s worrying.” I ask Bondarev whether he thinks he will continue to run even if things get worse. “I feel like if someone doesn’t want to run, they will find any excuse, but if they do want to run, they will find a way. I think I will keep running. I’m not put off by adversity. I need to keep moving.”",News/World news,‘We’re showing we’re alive’: the older Ukrainians running daily as war rages,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/ukrainian-men-running-marathons-russia-invasion
3/10/2022,"A film on the pro-democracy protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019 has broken a box office record in Taiwan for an overseas Chinese-language documentary within the first fortnight of its release. Revolution of Our Times, directed by Hong Kong film-maker Kiwi Chow and which premiered at the Cannes film festival last year, has grossed around $17m NTD (US$600,000) as of Wednesday, the film’s distributor said. Released in Taiwan on 25 February, the film has been screened at about 40 cinemas across Taiwan, with some patrons booking out entire cinemas to screen the film for free. It has even drawn the support of the president, Tsai Ing-wen. “The Hong Kong people’s courage & commitment to democracy are an inspiration to us all, as we work to preserve our own freedoms & way of life,” Tsai tweeted on Wednesday. The documentary chronicles the months of mass demonstrations in Hong Kong which saw millions take to the streets to march against a proposed extradition law that many feared would have exposed Hongkongers to China’s opaque legal system. The protests, which sometimes descended into violent clashes between young protesters and police, prompted Beijing to impose a national security law that observers say has been used to quash any signs of dissent and dismantle the city’s civil society. Chow, who has remained in Hong Kong and has not been able to view his own film in a cinema, described the film’s success in Taiwan as a source of comfort. “It’s almost like a type of embrace … that so many are willing to listen to the will and desire of Hongkongers. I feel a sense of comfort, a sense of power in our unity.” He added that he was both envious and grateful. No public screenings have been possible in Hong Kong due to the national security law. “As the director of the Revolution of Our Times, I’ve never been able to see my own creation on the big screen. So I’m very envious of the Taiwanese and people abroad who can watch it in a cinema … I also hope that I can watch it with everyone on the big screen. I look forward to that day,” he said. The aftermath of Hong Kong’s protests have been warily watched from across the Taiwan strait, where some Taiwanese saw a warning for their own future. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has vowed to “unify” Taiwan with China, by force if necessary. “I think with these screenings, the most important thing isn’t to get people to focus on Hong Kong, the most important is that they are focused on Taiwan, their home,” Chow said. Screenings of the documentary are also being held in various cities across the UK and Canada. The film-maker said he hoped the film could have meaning and value to people everywhere. “Even in democratic countries, freedom can be lost,” he said.
