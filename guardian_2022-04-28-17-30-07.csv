4/28/2022,"A woman has described how her 17-year-old black British son was found at an immigration detention centre after going missing while being treated for psychosis. The boy – who is non-verbal – disappeared from a hospital in Kent, where he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, on 7 April. Two days later, he was arrested by British Transport Police (BTP) at Euston on suspicion of fare evasion, before being detained by Immigration Enforcement near Gatwick, despite being British. “It’s just horrific,” the boy’s mother said. “Because he’s black they just assumed ‘let’s pick him and put him in a deportation centre’.” When the boy was returned to the hospital, his clothes contained Home Office documents that incorrectly stated his name and date of birth, and recorded his nationality as Nigerian. “How do they know he’s from Nigeria, when he doesn’t even speak to them?” the woman said of her son. When the hospital became aware of his disappearance, the family, local police and BTP were notified, the woman said, and he was listed as a missing person. It is unclear where the boy went in the days before his arrest. He is understood to have travelled to Manchester, where the family had previously lived, before trying to return to London without a phone, money or identification. On the morning of 9 April, BTP said they were notified of a fare evader on board a London-bound train from Manchester. In a statement, BTP said the male provided a false name and date of birth, stating he was 20. At Euston, he was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and taken to police custody in Islington, according to BTP, where “officers were unable to engage with the male or verify the details provided despite their efforts, which included attending the address provided”. The boy’s fingerprints were then taken and he was detained by Immigration Enforcement. Documents apparently prepared at the detention centre, and seen by the Guardian, incorrectly state his name and date of birth, and record his nationality as Nigerian. They describe him as a person who requires leave to enter or remain in the country, which he does not have. On one document, it states his removal from the UK was “imminent” as he had failed to give “satisfactory or reliable answers” to immigration officers. The boy is a British citizen and has never left the UK. His mother said he would not have been able to say his date of birth properly, and would never have said he was from Nigeria. This week, a BTP commander told her that when they searched the Kent address the boy had provided, they discovered a Nigerian family living there. She was told that officers gathered the boy was from a Nigerian background as he had the same accent as the residents. She contested this statement, describing her son’s accent, when he does rarely speak, as Mancunian and London. James Wilson, deputy director of Detention Action, which works with people facing removal, said unaccompanied minors or children under the age of 18 should not be in detention in the first place. “In theory detention should be an absolute last resort, rather than an early step you would go to,” he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We rely on information provided by our policing partners when an individual is referred to Immigration Enforcement. In this case, the individual declared himself to British Transport Police to be an adult male. Police nurses assessed him and raised no physical or mental health issues.” The spokesperson said the individual gave no further information to Immigration Enforcement, and once his true identity had been established, he was returned into the care of mental health services. BTP said they were reviewing the incident internally.",News/World news,Non-verbal black teenager who has never left UK detained at immigration centre,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/non-verbal-black-teenager-who-has-never-left-uk-detained-at-immigration-centre
4/28/2022,"Pristine rainforests were once again destroyed at a relentless rate in 2021, according to new figures, prompting concerns governments will not meet a Cop26 deal to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of the decade. From the Brazilian Amazon to the Congo basin, the tropics lost 11.1m hectares of tree cover last year, including 3.75m ha of primary forest critical to limiting global heating and biodiversity loss. Boreal forests, mainly in Russia, experienced a record loss in 2021 driven by the worst wildfire season in Siberia since records began, according to new data from the University of Maryland released via Global Forest Watch. Experts called the continued forest loss a disaster for action on global heating and said the 143 governments that pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030 at Cop26held in Glasgow, had to urgently make good on their commitment. Of the primary rainforest that was lost in 2021 – releasing the equivalent of India’s annual fossil fuel emissions – 40% disappeared in Brazil, with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, Indonesia and Peru making up the rest of the top five. Despite the persistent loss of forests, experts pointed to signs of hope in the new figures. Indonesia reduced primary forest loss for a fifth straight year following government action on palm oil, fire management and an updated national climate plan which committed the country to becoming a carbon sink by 2030. Malaysia has also reduced primary forest lost in recent years, and experts pointed to the examples of Gabon and the Guyanas, that have had very low rates of forest loss over the last two decades. Rod Taylor, the global director of the forests programme at the World Resources Institute (WRI), which compiled the report, said while the global rates of forest loss appeared to be flatlining, they needed to dramatically decrease for the world to meet climate targets. “When you look at unchanging year-on-year statistics, you could conclude that they don’t really offer a newsworthy headline. But when it comes to the loss of primary tropical forests, stubbornly persistent rates relate to the climate, the extinction crisis and the fate of many first peoples. High rates of loss continue despite pledges from countries and companies,” Taylor said. Wildfires, rising temperatures and land clearances are affecting the resilience of forests around the world. Warnings point to parts of the Amazon being in danger of converting from rainforest to savannah. According to the figures there was a particularly worrying spike in deforestation in the western Brazilian Amazon, linked to large-scale clearing for cattle pastures along existing roads. When approached for comment by the Guardian, a spokesperson for the Brazilian government said they were committed to the Glasgow forest agreement aimed at eliminating illegal deforestation by 2028, and had dedicated extra resources to meeting the target. The expansion of small-scale agriculture and harvesting of trees to meet energy demands drove forest loss in the DRC last year, while Bolivia experienced record primary forest loss due to agriculture and fires, including in protected areas. Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the WRI, said the 2021 figures had to be taken as a baseline for assessing the Cop26 pledges, but underscored that dramatic action was needed, warning that countries that were taking action were not receiving enough financial support. Seymour said: “We’ve got 20 years of data showing the persistent annual loss of millions of hectares of primary tropical forests alone. But we don’t run out of fingers counting the number of years we have left to bring that number down to zero. We already knew that such losses are a disaster for the climate. They’re a disaster for biodiversity. They’re a disaster for Indigenous peoples and local communities.. “We have to dramatically reduce emissions from all sources. No one should even think any more about planting trees instead of reducing emissions from fossil fuels. It’s got to be both and it’s got to be now before it’s too late.” The UK environment minister Lord Goldsmith, who played a key role in the agreement at Cop26 of 143 countries to halt and reverse deforestation, said the figures were a stark reminder of the need for governments to make good on their commitments. “If we continue to degrade the world’s great forests, from the Amazon to the Congo basin, the implications for millions of people are terrible. We are derailing complex natural systems we all depend on, and that in turn makes meeting any of our shared global goals, from peace to prosperity, impossible,” he said.

4/28/2022,"Sainsbury’s has warned profits will fall in the year ahead as it faces “significant external pressures” including cost inflation and a squeeze on its customers’ spare cash. The UK’s second-largest supermarket said it expected to make a full-year profit of up to £690m in the year ahead, down from £730m in the year to March 2021, which it said was helped by £100m in extra sales driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. The profits warning comes after sales at the supermarket rose 3.4% in the year to March led by a 60% increase in sales of petrol and a near 13% rise in sales of clothing as shoppers returned to socialising and the office as the pandemic restrictions were loosened. However, sales of general merchandise slid almost 12%, led by toys and consumer electronics as sales at the group’s Argos chain were hit by supply disruption and more competition than during high street lockdowns. Underlying pretax profits doubled to £730m as the company reduced extra costs related to staff and protective gear required during the pandemic. The group also received a one-off benefit of £182m in a legal settlement over credit and debit card fees. Simon Roberts, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said the retailer was aiming to keep a lid on inflation compared with its rivals by cutting costs. Plans include introducing more automated tills and combine its delivery networks and supply chains for Argos, Sainsbury’s and Habitat. “We know just how much everyone is feeling the impact of inflation, which is why we are so determined to keep delivering the best value for customers. We have been able to drive more investment into lowering food prices funded by our comprehensive cost savings plans,” he said.

4/28/2022,"A visit from the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan’s 2010 Pulitzer-winning rock’n’roll novel, felt like the beginning of something. It was a tale as gimmicky and restless as the smartphone era threatened to be. One chapter was written entirely in PowerPoint slides; another in textspeak (“if thr r children, thr mst b a fUtr, rt?”). The cast was a neon collision of kleptomaniacs, philanderers, It girls, autocrats and a guitar band called the Flaming Dildos. And the plot ricocheted like a browsing-addled brain. But if A Visit from the Goon Squad carried the promise of a grand wave of tech-inflected fiction, that literary trend never quite materialised. In an era of screen-curated selfhood, autofiction surged instead. A dozen years on, and Egan’s cult novel now feels like the end of something, a kind of techno-optimist elegy: a study in time’s “incremental deflations”, and the loneliness of hyper-connectivity. It’s this sense of paradoxical isolation that Egan revisits in her new book. The Candy House is less a sequel to Goon Squad than a fraternal twin. Minor characters are thrust into the thick of things; formerly major characters make Hitchcockian cameos. As befits its title, The Candy House is a novel of Easter eggs – of hidden in-joke treats. It begs to be read alongside its more extroverted sibling, and to consider, in the space between them, the deflations – incremental and otherwise – of the last decade. Egan begins on the sharp edge of an epiphany. Bix Bouton is a stony-faced “tech demigod”, the founder of social media mega-entity Mandala. By day, he strides about in his trademark leather fedora – his version of Zuckerberg’s grey T-shirt – busy “ubiquitising” his empire. By night, he dons a disguise and sneaks into a discussion group of Columbia University postgrads. For Bix is bereft of ideas. When he looks to the horizon of his mental landscape – the place where inspiration waits – there is nothing. These night-time debates will vanquish Bix’s great white emptiness. In their wake, he will create a household gadget that allows a human mind to be copied (a kind of cortical back-up drive), and a subscription-only spiritus mundi. Users who agree to upload their brains will gain access to the anonymised content of every other user, living or dead; a great “churning gyre” of memory and thought. Wondering about the identity of a beautiful stranger, the grisly truth of a murder, or the fate of a long-lost frenemy? Just run a face-match on the CollectiveConsciousness™. Who could resist the lure of a tangible, search-optimised past? “The collective is like gravity,” Egan writes, “almost no one can withstand it.” Against this backdrop of escalating disclosure – what Egan calls the “Self-Surveillance Era” – The Candy House tells stories of searching. A recovering heroin addict considers the redemptive possibility of Dungeons and Dragons. A lovesick programmer collects trinkets, like a human bowerbird, in the hope they’ll wordlessly convey his affection. A film-maker begins shrieking on the subway, to jolt his fellow commuters into a moment of pure sincerity. A former spy worries that her thoughts are no longer her own. Here, once again, is the novel as network: each component tale – each node – can be traced back to that New York apartment full of books and big talk, where Bix is waiting for his lightbulb moment. Connectivity is more than Egan’s theme, it’s her modus operandi. But for all Egan’s form-elasticity – her inventive peacocking, tech speculation and bricolage – the tales that work best in The Candy House are the least flamboyant. What felt playful in Goon Squad now feels a little stale: a sustained passage of back-and-forth emails is too conveniently expository; a treatise on spycraft is an on-the-nose wallop (“As Americans we prize human rights above all else and cannot sanction their violation. When someone threatens our rights, however, a wider leeway becomes necessary”). Underneath all the glitz and frippery, there is something fundamentally old-fashioned about The Candy House. Egan takes her title from Hansel and Gretel, and the wicked witch’s gingerbread trap. It’s a handy metaphor for the dopamine sugar-rush of social media, and the bargains we too willingly strike to participate in online life (“Never trust a candy house!”). But the most ardent searchers in this book are grown children – the sons and daughters of absent baby boomer parents. “An entire generation will throw off the fetters of rote commitment in favour of invention, hope,” one bereft daughter explains, as she reconstructs a catalytic night in her father’s life, “and we, their children, will try to locate the moment we lost them and worry that it was our fault.” So many Hansels and Gretels, wandering alone in the wilderness with their desperate hunger. It’s this insatiable – and unsatiable – yearning that The Candy House draws out so tenderly, as those children tell their feckless parents’ stories as a way to find their own, scour the great aggregate brain for signs they were loved, and reanimate a heyday they never lived. This is a novel of new tech and old wounds. The near-future America Egan conjures is numbed and festering: a country full of opioid dreamers and pill mills. But the most irresistible and dangerous drug of them all – the ultimate brain-rotting candy – is nostalgia, even the sly, ironic kind that powers our dreary cycle of reboots and remakes. “Tongue-in-cheek nostalgia is merely the portal, the candy house, if you will,” an ageing rock star muses, “through which we hope to lure in a new generation and bewitch them.” How hard it is to beat on, this novel shows, when we’re borne back ceaselessly into the past.

4/28/2022,"Sega, it seems, is having a moment. The veteran publisher’s movie sequel Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has become a huge box office success, hitting $300m in revenue, despite lukewarm reviews. It was also revealed that a film version of classic brawler Streets of Rage is in development, scripted by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad; some are postulating that this could be the beginning of a Sega Cinematic Universe. And last week, sources within the company revealed to Bloomberg that reboots of classic early 2000s titles Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio are in development, part of a new Super Games initiative to build Fortnite-like communities around its titles. Why so much Sega? Why now? Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has perhaps arrived at a good time with families venturing out to cinemas once again, desperate for something lighthearted that everyone can enjoy – and not having much choice when they reach the multiplex. And whatever you think about the finer points of the movie, it’s fast and fun, with an amusing performance from Idris Elba as Knuckles and Jim Carrey back to his hammy, gurning best. It captures the feel of those original Mega Drive games, with their madcap, screwball energy and bright, blue-sky optimism. More importantly, unlike Nintendo games, which have mostly been aimed at insulated family groups, Sega titles are for communities. Most of the company’s greatest games were developed for the arcades of the 80s and 90s, when they were jammed with teenagers, playing, watching and socialising, with the arcade cabinets as the central focus. When veteran designer Yu Suzuki began to build the classic “taiken” or “body sensation” games of the late 80s – such as OutRun, Space Harrier and Afterburner – his aim was to attract non-players into the arcades. He wanted people to come and watch, to enjoy the games as a performance, something cool to do on a Friday night with friends, or with a date. Later, in the 90s, younger Sega producers such as Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Kenji Kanno and Kazuki Hosokawa brought in a wealth of modern pop, art and music influences, so that their games felt like extensions of the Tokyo street cultures they understood. The graffiti-and-rollerskates action game Jet Set Radio combined fashion,hip-hop and skating into an experience that felt like being part of a gang. At a time in which we’re all trying to reconstruct friendship groups and social activities, a reboot seems like a really obvious idea. Meanwhile, Crazy Taxi harked back to Suzuki’s philosophy of intuitive and immersive entertainment for all. Players drive around a sunny city collecting and delivering passengers in their cab, and while the mechanics of the game are deep, Kanno ensured the game was entertaining, even if you were terrible at it. The music, zany characters and bustling streets all created a place that was fun to explore – and the timer was more generous than most coin-ops of the era, giving players longer than the standard three minutes for their 100 yen. This idea of games as something accessible, chaotic and performative is a Sega trait. True, Sega is now more of a publisher than a developer, and apart from the brilliant Yakuza series it hasn’t really created many era-defining hits since the early 2000s. But nostalgia is a big part of the appeal of the movie, and fuels the excitement around Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio and the forthcoming Sonic Origins, which packages up the hedgehog’s early adventures. These Sega games tap into our seemingly endless reverence for a sort of glamorised simulacrum of the 80s and 90s, all blue skies and blazing sun and euphoric electronic music; they call to mind the era of mindless action movies, Saturday morning cartoons, LA rock bands in lipstick and big hair, Ferrari Testarossas, the beaches of Malibu and alleyways of New York. Sega is having a moment because we are desperate once again for the joy it provided, those beautifully pixellated skylines, shared in packed arcades, surrounded by other players, no cares in the world.",Arts/Games,The joy of Sega: why Sonic is such a tonic,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/28/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-sega-games
4/28/2022,"This is a great draft class! It is unusually loaded at edge rusher and offensive tackle, two of the game’s premier positions. Where discussing this class gets sticky is that there are such slender gaps between the upper tiers of any given position group: there isn’t an obvious ‘elite’ sect. There are 50 players this year worthy of going in the first round. It just so happens they don’t play the game’s most valuable position. OC There is much talent to be had in the trenches and fascinating pass rush options. And a reminder that 2017 was also supposed to be a “weak quarterback class.” That’s the year Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson were drafted. (We’ll ignore the Bears whiffing on Mitch Trubisky at No 2 overall.) MJ It’s an unsexy draft class that’s for sure: the most talented players are edge rushers and offensive line types, not guys likely to transform the course of a franchise. But that could lead to teams building a deeper pool of talent rather going all-in on a star quarterback. A draft for the true football geeks, in other words. HF This class may not have any great quarterbacks, but it does have depth. Lots and lots of depth, at key positions at that. Edge rushers, wide receivers, and offensive tackles taken early (and some picked long after most fans stop paying attention) will make huge impacts for years to come. TF Travon Walker, edge, Georgia. Aidan Hutchinson, the favorite to go first overall, makes sense. He probably should go first overall. But Trent Baalke, the Jags’ chief decision-maker, is always liable to do Trent Baalke things. Walker is an outrageous athlete who can shift all along the defensive front. Baalke loves to draft toolsy prospects rather than those who have racked up college production. It would not be a shock to see him swing for the fences with a name other than Hutchinson. OC Aidan Hutchinson, edge, Michigan. There’s a reason the Jags have the No 1 overall selection and are perennially picking in the top 10: they need a boatload of help. Hutchinson is a safe but polished player who should give the Jags’ pass rush a much-needed boost. MJ Aidan Hutchinson. It’s not a complete lock, but the experts seem to have hitched their wagons to Hutchinson as the likely first pick, especially since the draft stock of his peer at edge rusher, Kayvon Thibodeaux, has fallen thanks to an early exit at the NFL scouting combine. HF Evan Neal, offensive tackle, Alabama. Neal has been dominant throughout his career at Alabama while playing against elite competition, and he has also showed the versatility to play multiple positions along the offensive line. New Jaguars head coach Doug Pederson knows he must protect quarterback Trevor Lawrence to have even the slightest chance of success in Jacksonville. TF Malik Willis, Liberty. When sorting through this iffy quarterback class, the first thing to do is to look at who has an A+ skill. Only one quarterback does: Willis. In fact, he has two: arm strength and his ability to create on the fly. He plays in a style that fits with where the NFL is at and where it’s heading. The step-up from Liberty is a big one, and his development will take time. But in terms of raw talent, Willis stands above the rest. OC Kenny Pickett, Pittsburgh. Pickett is far from a sure thing but has a lot in common with Joe Burrow. He’s dynamic in the pocket, athletic, and mobile. He’s also coming off a sensational year in which he completed 67.2% of his passes and threw for 4,319 yards and 42 touchdowns. If the Panthers take a QB at No 6, Pickett is the most pro-ready of the options. MJ Kenny Pickett. It’s possible there won’t be a long-term starting quarterback in the first round of this draft, but there are always teams that are desperate enough that they feel it’s worth a gamble. Pickett maybe isn’t the first quarterback in most mock drafts, but he did few things wrong last year for Pittsburgh. HF Malik Willis. Willis may face a steep adjustment transitioning from Liberty to the NFL but he has a cannon disguised as a right arm and unparalleled explosiveness as a runner. TF Brandon Smith, LB, Penn State. A former five-star recruit, Smith was cast in a wonky role at Penn State, but his game marries up better with the NFL than the college game. He’s expected to go in the fourth or fifth round, which could prove a steal. OC Tyler Goodson, running back, Iowa. The first-round running back is becoming increasingly rare. But the sixth-round rusher who makes an immediate impact is on an upward trajectory. Elijah Mitchell (963 rushing yards in 11 games for the 49ers last season) and Chicago’s Khalil Herbert are last year’s examples. The versatile Goodson, who comes from Iowa’s pro-style offense, could very well follow suit. MJ Matt Araiza, punter, San Diego State. As someone obsessed with the singular art of punting, I’m intrigued at the idea that we could see Araiza targeted in the second or third round. Since the Bengals may have discovered a generational kicker in the draft last year, it feels like a punter is now due. HF Marcus Jones, cornerback, Houston. The cornerback out of Houston has all the athleticism and instincts to make an impact as a slot defender. But regardless of that he will absolutely, positively, be an elite punt returner. Jones tied the NCAA record with nine punt returns for touchdowns and has even played some snaps at slot wide receiver on offense. TF The Baltimore Ravens. Lamar Jackson has yet to sign a contract extension. The defense is getting a complete overhaul (and needs pieces at the deepest position in the draft: pass-rush). And it’s year three of talk of the Ravens diversifying their passing game. In a stacked AFC North, the stakes are high for Baltimore. OC Lots of options given that eight teams have two first-round picks. But the Green Bay Packers are most in need of using their two picks (No 22 from the Davante Adams trade and No 28) on rookies who can help 38-year-old Aaron Rodgers win now. Will the Packers double up on wideouts? MJ The New York Giants have both the fifth overall pick and, via the deal that handed quarterback Justin Fields to the Chicago Bears in last year’s draft, the seventh. That’s especially interesting since this might be their last opportunity to see if they can build a workable team around their guy at quarterback, Daniel Jones. HF The Kansas City Chiefs are tied for the most draft picks this year with 12 and need to make a few of them count. The rest of the AFC West has finally built rosters that can compete with KC and the Chiefs need to retool at multiple positions if they wish to stay atop the division. TF New England Patriots. Mac Jones proved to be the most consistent quarterback from a much-ballyhooed class. Christian Barmore, the team’s second-round pick, is as exciting and explosive a young interior rusher as anywhere in the league. Add to that, they selected Rhamondre Stevenson in the fourth round, who wound up being the team’s lead running back. OC The Denver Broncos had phenomenal results from last year’s draft class. First round cornerback Pat Surtain II is a star in the making, who ended his rookie year with four interceptions and 14 passes deflected. Second day players like guard Quinn Meinerz, linebacker Baron Browning and running back Javonte Williams all developed into key contributors. MJ I’m going to give credit to the Cincinnati Bengals. During last year’s draft, I mocked them for not taking Penei Sewell to protect their quarterback Joe Burrow. Instead, they went with Burrow’s old college receiver Ja’Marr Chase. While they still could have used a Sewell-type for their offensive line, they probably don’t make it to the Super Bowl last season without the Burrow-Chase matchup. HF As a wise man once said, “How ‘bout them Cowboys?” Defensive rookie of the year Micah Parsons has already proven to be a demon and one of the best players in the NFL. But beyond that three other 2021 picks made an impact in the starting lineup and several more played important support roles. TF 1) Jacksonville Jaguars: Travon Walker, edge. 2) Detroit Lions: Aidan Hutchinson, edge. 3) Houston Texans: Ikem Ekwonu, offensive tackle. 4) New York Jets: Ahmad ‘Sauce’ Gardner, cornerback. 5) New York Giants: Evan Neal, offensive tackle.

4/28/2022,"Chinese authorities have said they are cracking down on price gouging as food shortages due to Shanghai’s lockdown continue and fears in Beijing prompt a run on supermarkets. It comes as social media platforms shut down the account of a high-profile critic of the government’s insistence on a traditional Chinese medicine product being rolled out to millions of residents. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Public Security pledged any individuals taking advantage of outbreaks to make a profit would be dealt with strictly, with fines of up to 3m yuan (£363,400). In Shanghai, one man faced administrative punishment for “fabricating and disseminating price increase information and disrupting market price orders”. The man was accused of buying produce and reselling it online at prices increased by up to 360%. Another was accused of renting someone else’s business licence and selling produce and food online at inflated prices, making $230,000 (£180,000) in profit. Last month, Shanghai’s market supervision authorities said they had already issued about 20,000 warning letters over price gouging. In Beijing, residents have reported steep price rises in shops. Fears that the capital could head into lockdown prompted widespread stockingpiling, leading to shortages in some supermarkets, even in areas not yet designated medium or high risk. “People are in an area without the epidemic, and they came back to the vegetable market today. The price of eggs has gone up, and the price of meat has gone up, and the potatoes are still there, but their value has doubled,” said one resident on Weibo. “I didn’t panic, but this is urging me to panic.” Authorities have ordered mass testing of more than 20 million people across Beijing and suspended all weddings, funerals and banquets as they seek to head off a growing outbreak. On Thursday, the city reported 50 new cases. Authorities locked down some individual residential buildings, office blocks and a university and closed some public spaces and venues. Across China analysts estimate that more than 340 million people are under full or partial lockdowns in 46 cities. The southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou cancelled hundreds of flights and ordered mass testing of about 5.6 million people after it detected one suspected case. Meanwhile, Shanghai reported its lowest daily case numbers in more than three weeks on Thursday, with 9,330 asymptomatic diagnoses. Authorities said they would make more resources available to improve vaccination rates among elderly people, but have not showed signs of lifting the lockdown. Shanghai’s 25 million residents have been in lockdown for weeks, with major food shortages and delivery issues. Among the complaints are accusations over the government’s insistence on supplying households with millions of doses of Lianhua Qingwen – a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) being used as a Covid-19 treatment. Residents said delivery of the unrequested doses appeared to be prioritised over food. TCM has major backing from China’s central and local governments and is among the products Beijing has donated to other countries in aid to combat Covid-19. However, Lianhua Qingwen has become controversial, with signs that criticism of it is not tolerated as authorities seek to contain expressions of dissent. Wang Sicong, a well-known figure and son of one of China’s richest men, was banned from Weibo and his account shut down on Wednesday after apparent questioning of the efficacy of Lianhua Qingwen. In a post to about 40 million followers, Wang had asked whether the product had been approved by the World Health Organization. In a since deleted post he also reportedly urged China’s regulators to investigate the manufacturer, Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical. Following Wang’s post shares in the company plummeted 35%, Bloomberg reported. Last week Wang’s account was suspended, a notice saying only that it had “violated related laws and regulations”. Yiling Pharmaceutical said it would take legal action against defamatory statements. On Wednesday, it was deleted entirely. Wang’s posts were among the most high-profile representations of growing discontent in China, as lockdowns and harsh zero-Covid measures continue, particularly in Shanghai. The WHO has examined TCM as a treatment, finding “promising data” that it helped reduce progression of the disease, Quartz reported.

4/28/2022,"The so-called ten pound Pom scheme has been reborn as a tourism campaign to bring British backpackers back to Australia in the wake of the pandemic. After the second world war, the Australian government lured hundreds of thousands of Britons over the seas with a £10 ticket to boost the population and supply post-war industries with workers. The 2022 version is somewhat more limited in its scope – and more expensive, despite the marketing gimmick. Under the scheme, which is the brainchild of the South Australian state government, only 200 young people will be able to apply, they won’t be able to bring their kids with them, and they’ll need a A$495 (or around £281) working holiday visa first. British or Irish citizens with the visa can apply for a £10 return ticket, as long as they also buy a package from tour operator Trailfinders. While the South Australian government very deliberately nods to it by saying the air tickets will be precisely £10, it avoids the word “Pom”, which the Macquarie Dictionary describes as “sometimes derogatory, racist” and “historically a mild put-down for a newly arrived British immigrant”. The original ten pound Pom plan (or the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme) ran through the 1940s and 50s, while the White Australia policy was still in place.

If they’re one of the lucky 200 applicants, they have to choose between a three-night arrival pack (£171), staying in a “sociable hostel” in Adelaide, and a six-night pack (£244).",News/Australia news,Return of the ten pound Pom as South Australia moves to fill post-pandemic job vacancies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/return-of-the-ten-pound-pom-as-south-australia-moves-to-fill-post-pandemic-job-vacancies
4/28/2022,"Liberal party MP Trent Zimmerman says he and fellow moderate MPs “prevailed” over the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, in securing a net zero climate target, saying the Nationals leader was opposed to the policy. Zimmerman, a key Liberal party moderate facing a serious challenge to hang on to the North Sydney electorate from the independent Kylea Tink, told a Sky News debate on Thursday that he would push for “stronger” emissions targets if the Coalition was re-elected. “Soon we will be putting forward our targets for 2035 and I’m going to be pushing for them to be even stronger still, as I’m sure they will be,” he said. Zimmerman is among a group of Liberal party moderates, along with the Wentworth MP, Dave Sharma, and the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, fighting off challenges from so-called “teal independents” on issues such as climate change in next month’s election. During the debate, Zimmerman insisted he and other moderates had won a net zero commitment from the government despite the opposition from the junior Coalition partner. “Barnaby Joyce was opposed to that,” he said. “On an issue like that we prevailed.” He also disagreed with Nationals MP Matt Canavan’s comment that a target of net zero emissions by 2050 is “all over”. “The prime minister is on my side on this and not Matt Canavan’s,” Zimmerman said. “Thankfully [Canavan’s comments are] not the government policy. I took a position, along with a number of my colleagues, for net zero by 2050 and we fought really hard for it.” He said the government “hasn’t been perfect”, and that he had “occasionally had the odd disagreement” on policies, including the religious discrimination bill which he crossed the floor to oppose. Thursday’s debate, which also included Labor’s candidate in North Sydney, Catherine Renshaw, saw both major party candidates target Tink on who she would support in the event of a hung parliament. Tink refused to say who she would support, insisting she would speak to both parties after the election. But she said her support would depend on stronger climate targets, the establishment of a federal integrity commission and vehicle emission standards. Zimmerman and Renshaw seized on the refusal to say who she would support, with the Labor candidate saying it was “fundamental” to the independent’s integrity. “The fact that both parties have actually put their policies on the table, you should be able to read those policies and say this most closely aligns with what I’m telling the people I’m going to do in Canberra,” Renshaw said. “Especially if you’re running on an integrity platform.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning During the debate Zimmerman said he did not support controversial comments about trans people made by Liberal party candidate Katherine Deves, but stopped short of publicly calling for her to be disendorsed.“I’ve made it very clear I don’t support Katherine Deves’ comments at all,” he said.“Anyone who knows me and my record in parliament knows I’m someone who for six years stood up for LGBTI community. That has been important to me and who I am and so I find comments [that are] transphobic and homophobic particularly difficult.“She is the candidate now [and] I have views about that that I have obviously conveyed within the party. She has apologised for her remarks as she should have.”",News/Australia news,Trent Zimmerman says moderate MPs ‘prevailed’ over Barnaby Joyce on net zero emissions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/28/trent-zimmerman-says-moderate-mps-prevailed-over-barnaby-joyce-on-net-zero-emmissions
4/28/2022,"Barclays has become the latest UK bank to warn over the impact of the cost of living crisis, saying that its customers were already facing “harder conditions” as a result of surging inflation. It came as the bank put aside an extra £141m to cover potential defaults on its loans in the first quarter, nearly three times the amount put aside during the same period in 2021, but lower than the £299m that analysts had forecast. While Barclays said it was still facing “low delinquencies” so far, it acknowledged uncertainty over the long-term impacts of the war in Ukraine, which contributed to a 7% rise in UK inflation last month. “The ongoing geopolitical situation could put further pressure on already high levels of inflation, which may weigh on corporate profitability and consumer affordability levels,” the bank said, adding that a fresh surge in Covid infection rates could result in further labour shortages and supply chain disruption. The bank’s chief executive, CS Venkatakrishnan, said the bank was staying in touch with customers who may be struggling financially as a result of the cost of living crisis. “We remain focused on the impact higher prices are having on our customers and our small business and corporate clients, all of whom are facing far harder conditions this year as a result of inflation, supply chain issues and higher energy costs. “We will support them through this difficult period wherever we can, and support the wider economy,” he added. The bank said it still expected loan loss charges to stay below pre-pandemic levels, partly due to the fact that many customers had spent the Covid crisis paying off their debts. Overall, Barclays reported a 7% increase in pre-tax profits in the first three months of the year to £2.3bn, easily beating average analyst estimates which had forecast a 45% slump in profits to £1.3bn. Profits would have been even higher had Barclays not put aside more than £500m to cover legal costs related to the over-selling of American financial products. The chief executive told journalists that the scandal was “entirely avoidable” and that he was “deeply disappointed”, given it has raised concerns about Barclays’ internal controls. The blunder has also forced the bank to delay its share buyback programme, thoughBarclays said it remained committed to handing more money to shareholders “as soon as practicable”.",News/Business,Barclays warns inflation and cost of living crisis is hurting customers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/barclays-warns-inflation-and-cost-of-living-crisis-is-hurting-customers
