Jennifer Crumbley, the mother of the suspected Oxford High School shooter, messaged ""my son ruined so many lives today"" to a friend after the shooting, according to court testimony on Tuesday. James and Jennifer Crumbley face charges of involuntary manslaughter after last November's school shooting that left four students dead and seven more injured. Prosecutors alleged that the Crumbleys made it too easy for their son, 15, to gain access to a handgun. Both parents face up to 60 years in prison and $30,000 in fines if convicted. Kira Pennock, a family friend, testified during a preliminary hearing for the Crumbleys manslaughter trial on Tuesday. Pennock testified that she owns a horse farm in Michigan and gives horse riding lessons. She said in court that the Crumbleys keep two horses that they own in her stables. Pennock said in court that when she heard about the Oxford shooting, she assumed that it was the Crumbleys' son who was responsible because ""they own guns and they go out shooting."" On November 30 2021, the day of the Oxford High School shooting, Pennock testified that Jennifer Crumbley Facebook messaged her with concerns about her son's mental health. Crumbley sent Pennock a photo of a math worksheet that her son had completed earlier in the day where he wrote ""my life is useless"" on the paper, Pennock said in court. Pennock testified that Crumbley said she did not want her son to be alone and asked Pennock if she could take him to the horse farm after school for some riding lessons. During the course of their conversation throughout the day, Pennock testified that Crumbley's messages changed and she started to seem ""upset."" Pennock said in court that Crumbley indicated that she wanted to sell her two horses to her before sending a message that said ""I'm bawling so much right now Kira."" A defense attorney asked Pennock if Crumbley messaged her ""my son ruined so many lives today,"" and she replied ""yes."" Pennock testified that she replied to Crumbley that she would take care of her horses to ""take something off of her plate."" According to Pennock, she messaged Crumbley, ""It sounds like Ethan was a troubled kid. This doesn't even remotely make me think it's your fault."" A defense attorney asked Pennock what she meant by the message and Pennock replied that she ""had never gotten the feeling that Jenn and James had issues with their son."" Prosecutors asked Pennock about more messages that Crumbley sent to Pennock where Crumbley said she wished her son had shown ""warnings."" Pennock testified that she messaged Crumbley that ""hindsight is always 20-20. When something bad happens, we look back at what could have prevented it.""

2/9/2022,"Kevin McCarthy defended the RNC after it censured Cheney and Kinzinger for participating in the Jan 6 committee. McCarthy said that ""legitimate political discourse"" refers to people who ""were in Florida that day."" But he declined to say whether he supported the censure resolution. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy defended the wording of the Republican National Committee's censure resolution against Republican Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming on Tuesday. The House GOP leader said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel's comments accusing Kinzinger and Cheney of persecuting ""legitimate political discourse"" by serving on the House Select Committee probing January was referred to RNC members ""who were in Florida"" on January 6, 2021 and had been subpoenaed by the committee. Followed down a hallway by CNN reporter Manu Raju, McCarthy was asked about the controversial phrasing of the resolution, which referred to the January 6 committee as a ""Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse."" ""Everybody knows, anybody who broke in and caused damage, that was not called for,"" said McCarthy. ""Those people, I've said from the very beginning, should be in jail."" But McCarthy disputed that the language in the resolution refers to the events of the January 6 assault on the Capitol as ""legitimate political discourse."" ""What they were talking about is the 6 RNC members who [the January 6 committee] has subpoenaed who weren't even here, who were in Florida that day,"" he said. Asked whether he supported the censure resolution, he declined to respond and continued walking. â€”Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 8, 2022 McCarthy was likely referring to RNC members who have been subpoenaed in connection with a scheme for Trump supporters in states that voted for President Joe Biden to send false slates of presidential electors for Trump to official government bodies in Washington, including the National Archives. It is unclear, however, which RNC members were ""in Florida"" on January 6. The false slates of electors were not sanctioned or signed by any government body, like a governor, and did not have any legal authority whatsoever during the joint session of Congress to count electoral votes on January 6, 2021. The January 6 Committee has subpoenaed 14 individuals who signed their names to fake slates of electors for Trump as the ""chairperson"" or ""secretary"" of the electors, CNN reported. The false electoral slates in all seven states were signed by either the chair or vice-chair of the state's Republican Party organization, according to States Newsroom. Two of the people subpoenaed by the January 6 Committee, Kathy Berden of Michigan and James DeGraffenreid of Nevada, are RNC national committee members. The Department of Justice and several state-level attorneys general are also investigating the fake slates of electors for potential crimes related to fraud or forgery. Another top House Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, also declined to condemn the RNC's censure of Kinzinger and Cheney, who she replaced as House GOP Conference Chair in May. ""My reaction is that the RNC has every right to take any action, and the position I have is that you're ultimately held accountable by voters in your district,"" Stefanik said in a Tuesday news conference.
