1/28/2022,"A former Missouri Christian school teacher and her husband who said former President Donald Trump and the crowd contributed to the environment that led to the Capitol riot were sentenced Thursday to home detention and two years’ probation. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sentenced Zachary Wilson to 45 days of home detention and Kelsey Wilson to 30 days, along with 60 hours of community service. They also must each pay $500 in restitution for damage done to the Capitol during the insurrection, which prosecutors say totaled $1.5 million. “It’s hard to avoid getting on a soap box in these cases, and I’m trying to resist doing that,” Mehta said. “But I don’t think it would be appropriate to at least not let any sentencing pass without reflecting on the magnitude of what occurred on January the sixth and how you all contributed to it.” Mehta said Jan. 6 was a day in which the country was to transition power peacefully from one president to the next. “Regrettably, you all made the decision to do something that contributed to a transition of power that ultimately was marred by violence, destruction and death,” he told the Wilsons. “And that’s not something that anybody ought to downplay or suggest is not significant or could be justified by events earlier in the summer. It’s really not justifiable.” The sentencing for the single misdemeanor charge of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building on Jan. 6. was held via video conference in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Wilsons had each faced a maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $5,000 fine. The government had recommended 14 days’ incarceration, three years’ probation and $500 restitution. The Wilsons are the third and fourth Missouri residents to be sentenced of the 18 who have been charged in the Capitol riot cases. They each addressed the judge before he issued their sentences. “I cannot apologize enough or express remorse that I have for the actions that day,” Zachary Wilson said. “My wife and I went to Washington, D.C., to hear former President Trump and the guest speakers. We had no intention of interfering with the Congressional proceedings. We saw the crowd and got caught up and followed them up to the building. “I’m incredibly sorry for my part in what has now put a stain on American history.” Mehta asked him why he thought it was permissible to breach the Capitol that day. “I was caught up in President Trump telling everybody that this election got stolen and he had kind of everybody enraged,” Zachary Wilson said. “We didn’t even have any idea that we were gonna do a march. We thought we were just there for the speech. And then when he said, ‘Yeah, turn around and march,’ and everybody’s like, ‘Yeah, march.’ And he’d already had everybody so worked up that when we got up there I just reacted wrongly. I really feel stupid, to be honest.” A tearful Kelsey Wilson told the judge that her arrest “will undoubtedly be one of the most life-changing things that I will ever go through.” “I know what I did on January sixth was wrong,” she said. “We got caught up in everything that had been happening over the last year and we got swept up in the crowd. And I’m deeply and truly sorry and embarrassed for my actions that day.” She said their lives would never be the same. ‘I’ve already lost not one but two jobs because of my actions that day and my family is struggling,” she said. “My family is truly sorry for the embarrassment that we brought on our country, and we will definitely pay for this for the rest of our lives.” Kelsey Wilson had been employed as a first grade teacher by Dayspring Christian School in Springfield for about a month at the time of her arrest last August. When asked why she went into the Capitol, she told the judge that “I think a lot of it just had to do with seeing everything over the summer…seeing cities burn and people divided for the last several years and then getting there and getting caught up in the crowd. It was a stupid mistake.” Mehta told the couple that in many ways, they were victims as well. “You were told lies about election fraud, about your country being taken from you,” he said. “They were lies. And regrettably, you believed them. And you acted on that.” However, he added, “I think you are decent hard-working Americans who regrettably were caught up in something I think if you could again, I genuinely believe you would not.” He noted that the couple had overcome difficult pasts and tried to make their lives better for them and their children. “I think the hardest part of all of this, frankly…is what you all have endured so far and the fact that you are going to have to explain to your kids what happened that day and how their parents got caught up in something that they shouldn’t have,” he said. Zachary Wilson was initially charged in February 2021 with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building. Kelsey Wilson was charged six months later with knowingly entering or remaining in a restricted building; disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds; disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds; and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. All the counts were misdemeanors. As part of the plea agreement, the government dropped the other counts against the two and charged them with the single “parading” count. Prosecutors said the Wilsons illegally entered and roamed through the Capitol, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, where Zachary Wilson took a video. Zachary Wilson then posted pictures and video on Facebook. One post said, “first ones in !!!! First thing we found was Pelosi’s office.” When FBI agents later interviewed the couple, they lied repeatedly about their participation in the riot, prosecutors said. “A riot cannot occur without rioters, and each rioter’s actions — from the most mundane to the most violent — contributed, directly and indirectly, to the violence and destruction of that day,” the government said in its sentencing memorandum filed with the court. Prosecutors added that “the trauma experienced by the members of Congress and Speaker Pelosi’s staff is significant. A group of Speaker Pelosi’s staffers barricaded themselves behind a door and hid under a desk for more than 2 hours.” The government acknowledged that the Wilsons accepted responsibility early by entering into a plea agreement and noted that Kelsey Wilson “made a significant effort to get the FBI videos and pictures taken by Zach Wilson.” Prosecutors said, however, that their repeated lies to the FBI and Zachary Wilson’s posts on social media underscored the need for a sentence that included some jail time. The Wilsons asked for 12 months’ probation in their sentencing memorandums filed with the court. They argued that they were not political extremists and had gone to Washington, D.C., solely to show their support for Trump at the “Stop the Steal” rally. Kelsey Wilson’s attorney, Kira West, wrote in her sentencing memorandum that the couple had rented a car and driven to D.C. with a friend of Kelsey Wilson’s to hear Trump speak, leaving their two children with Kelsey’s mother. “As the day unfolded, she never planned or envisioned entering the U.S. Capitol,” West said. “That is, not until President Trump invited everyone to march to the Capitol. Mrs. Wilson followed the large crowd there that day with no intention of doing anything.” The Wilsons were not armed or dressed for combat, their attorneys said, nor did they destroy any property or commit any violence. They were in the Capitol for less than 20 minutes, they said, were respectful while in Pelosi’s office and met no resistance from authorities. “After seeing the video footage showing protesters beating police officers, spraying gas in their faces, screaming obscenities, and destroying property, it made her cringe,” West said of Kelsey Wilson. “She did not witness any of this at all. She is left with deep regret, fear, shame, and remorse.”",U.S./Kansas City Star,"‘A stain on American history.’ MO couple sentenced in Capitol riot blame Trump, crowd",https://news.yahoo.com/stain-american-history-mo-couple-192942178.html
1/28/2022,"The Italian royals have requested the return of their crown jewels, The Telegraph reports. The family lost jewels thought to be worth $335 million when the monarchy was abolished. They have been held in a vault in the Bank of Italy ever since. The former Italian royal family are asking the country to return their crown jewels, which are thought to be worth €300 million, or around $335 million, The Telegraph reports. The family — also known as the royal House of Savoy — lost its collection of tiaras, earrings, necklaces, and brooches when the monarchy was abolished in 1946. Ever since, the jewels have been kept in a vault in the Bank of Italy in Rome, the publication added. A mediation meeting was held on Tuesday between representatives of the Bank of Italy and lawyers for the House of Savoy, which was found to be inconclusive, according to The Telegraph. The publication added that the bank will likely defer the royals' request to the government.  ""Italy should do what is right and fitting and restore the jewels to my family,"" Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy told The Telegraph's Nick Squires. ""The monetary value of the jewels doesn't interest us. What is more important is the historical and sentimental value that they have for the family."" Prince Emmanuele added that while other nations keep their jewels on display, like Great Britain keeping its crown jewels in the Tower of London, this has never been the case for Italy. ""Italy is about the only republic in the world where the private property of the ex-royal family is still in the hands of the State. It's shameful. Even Russia and Yugoslavia restored private possessions to their royals,"" he said. Prince Emanuele is the grandson of the last king of Italy and is considered a celebrity in the country. The prince previously told Insider that he spent the first 30 years of his life in exile after the Italian government banned male heirs from returning to the country. The ban was finally lifted in 2002. Representatives for Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy and the Bank of Italy did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.  Read the original article on Insider",World/INSIDER,Italy's former royal family want their $335 million crown jewels back 75 years after the monarchy was abolished,https://news.yahoo.com/italys-former-royal-family-want-125749941.html
1/28/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — From the deadly crushing of Beijing’s 1989 pro-democracy protests to the suppression of Hong Kong’s opposition four decades later, China’s Communist Party has demonstrated a determination and ability to stay in power that is seemingly impervious to Western criticism and sanctions. As Beijing prepares to hold the Winter Olympics opening next week, China's president and party leader Xi Jinping appears firmly in control. The party has made political stability paramount and says that has been the foundation for the economic growth that has bettered lives and put the nation on a path to becoming a regional if not global power. While many have benefitted economically, the price has been paid by those who wanted more freedom, from ethnic groups in the far western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang to the largely student-led protesters in Hong Kong in 2019. The party leadership was divided when an earlier generation of student protesters took control for weeks of the symbolically important grounds of Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. The hardline leaders won and the protesters were crushed rather than accommodated, a fateful decision that has guided the party's approach to this day. “The world came up with the assumption that with economic engagement with China, China would thrive, which would give birth to a powerful middle class, which would give birth then to a civil society which would give birth then to a democracy that would make China a responsible stakeholder in the world arena,” said Wu’er Kaixi, who as a university student helped lead the 1989 protests and now lives in exile in Taiwan. That assumption, he added, proved naive and wrong. Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics manifested hope that reforms might be on the way, bringing greater space for free speech, independent labor unions and protection of the cultural and religious identities of ethnic groups. Tibetan groups staged protests in China and abroad, disrupting the torch relay. Nearly 15 years later, on the eve of the Winter Games, the reality is far different. Tibet remains firmly under Communist Party control, and the government launched a fierce crackdown against the Turkic Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang in 2017 and enacted new laws and loyalty requirements to drive out opposition in Hong Kong in response to massive protests that turned violent in 2019. Under Xi, who came to power in 2012, the party has clamped down on dissident voices and anyone who challenges its version of events, from a #MeToo movement that flourished briefly to citizen journalists who exposed the crisis and chaos in Wuhan in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Xi is now expected to be appointed to a third five-year term as the ruling party’s general secretary this fall, cementing his position as China’s strongest leader since Mao Zedong. With no term limits on the position, Xi could remain leader indefinitely, with no clearly defined rules on succession. Xi approaches the party meeting bolstered by a strong economy, the ending of separatist violence in Xinjiang and the passage of a sweeping national security law and electoral changes in Hong Kong that have eviscerated the political opposition in the territory. “Xi Jinping wants to become a leader like Mao,” said Joseph Cheng, a political scientist and veteran Hong Kong pro-democracy activist who now lives in Australia. Mao Zedong founded China's communist state in 1949 and led the country for more than two decades. Having maintained relative prosperity and rock-hard political control, Xi and the party face little pressure and see no need to make concessions, Cheng said. “There are no checks and balances domestically and internationally. As a result, there is an increasingly authoritarian regime,” he said. The suppression of the Tiananmen protests marked the end of a period of limited political liberalization in the 1980s. The chaos and violence of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution and the decline of the Soviet Union had already impressed on the ruling party that political stability should be maintained at whatever cost. The crackdown carried out with tanks and assault troops was seen as the only way to ensure continued Communist Party rule and what Xi has since termed the realization of the “Chinese dream” of restoring the country's position in the world. The events of 1989 remain a taboo topic in China to this day. Future years saw advocates for free expression and civil rights continue to push the boundaries. Beijing responded to some appeals by releasing pro-democracy activists into foreign exile. At the same time, the party opened new avenues for education and employment, loosened restrictions on the private sector and welcomed foreign investment. A new generation of young Chinese grew up with heightened expectations and little knowledge of the political turmoil of past years. Despite their misgivings about the crackdown, China's booming economy was too much of a draw to ignore, and Western democracies swiftly re-engaged with the regime in the 1990s and 2000s. More recently, the U.S. has turned against China, viewing what is now the world's second largest economy as a growing competitor as well as an opportunity. China's policies in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, and on human rights in general, have brought travel and financial sanctions from the U.S. and others on the officials and companies involved. Beijing has responded with dismissals and disdain. A diplomatic boycott of the Olympics announced by Washington, the U.K. and others was greeted with contempt by Beijing for what it called a meaningless gesture that would change nothing. China has sought to redefine human rights as improvements in the quality of life, and cites economic growth and poverty reduction as the real determinants. It has written off campaigns by foreign politicians, trade groups and companies to boycott cotton goods and other products from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labor. China calls such claims “the lie of the century,"" although some experts say the bad publicity may have prompted it to shut down its prison-like system of internment camps. But activists' calls to move the Olympics out of China have gone unheeded. A diplomatic boycott won't stop the athletes from competing. Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch, said the International Olympic Committee lost all credibility on promoting human rights after choosing Beijing for the Winter Games. Kaixi, the former Tiananmen protester and an ethnic Uyghur, said China could not have succeeded in its defiance without the acquiescence of the international community. “China can only get away with all this because the world is giving in,"" he said. ___ Associated Press journalist Johnson Lai in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,"From Tiananmen to Hong Kong, China's crackdowns defy critics",https://news.yahoo.com/tiananmen-hong-kong-chinas-crackdowns-052009906.html
1/28/2022,"After a Chicago teenager opened fire on a street corner Saturday afternoon, killing 8-year-old Melissa Ortega and injuring at least one other, he and his adult getaway driver grabbed sandwiches, prosecutors said on Thursday. “They drove to a Subway to get Subway sandwiches,” Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney James Murphy said at a hearing. “They are seen laughing, having a good time, and then they go to a gas station to buy beverages.” The shocking reveal came during a bond hearing for Xavier Guzman and Emilio Corripio for their alleged role in the fatal Saturday afternoon shooting in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood. Guzman, a 27-year-old cab driver, and 16-year-old Corripio are facing multiple charges, including first-degree murder, for the shooting that killed Ortega and injured another. Prosecutors said Thursday that Corripio was a self-identified Latin King Gang member. Both defendants were denied bail on Thursday. During the bond hearing, Murphy said the pair expressed an “utter disregard for human life” when they participated in the shooting that also caused bullets to hit a car where a 47-year-old man and his 9-year-old daughter hid inside. In total, four individuals were affected by the gunfire, including a 29-year-old man who was the intended target after allegedly flashing rival gang signs on the street, prosecutors said. “One child was lost that day. It could have easily been two. That 9-year-old was almost killed as well,” Murphy stressed. The Jan. 22 incident began just after 2 p.m. when Guzman picked up Corripio at his home in his cab, according to a bond court proffer obtained by The Daily Beast. As they drove into Little Village, an area described by prosecutors as “2-6 gang territory,” they saw an individual “flashing 2-6 gang signs,” a rival of the Latin Kings. The motion prompted the pair to drive toward a nearby alley, where the teenager allegedly exited the car in a “dark jacket” and a black mask before pulling out a gun. The teenager is then seen on video shooting the 29-year-old and an unknown individual, moving around “as he continued to shoot,” Murphy said in court. While the 29-year-old was able to run and hide in a nearby building, the prosecutor added that he was shot in the back. Further down the street, prosecutors say, the father and his 9-year-old daughter were inside their car waiting for the individuals flashing the 2-6 gang signs to leave. But when Corripio opened fire, “multiple bullets struck"" their car, prosecutors added. “At the same time, Melissa Ortega, an 8-year-old girl wearing a pink hat, was walking... on 26th street, holding her mother’s hand,” prosecutors detailed in the proffer. When Corripio allegedly struck the 29-year-old, Ortega “looked behind her as she and her mother were crossing"" the street. “When the shots rang out, Melissa and her mother began to jog quickly away from the gunfire when Melissa was shot in the head,” prosecutors said. “Melissa fell to the ground on the corner of Pulaski and 26th Street where she died.” After the deadly shooting, Corripio went back to the car where Guzman was waiting and the pair drove off toward a nearby Subway, prosecutors continued. They added that the duo arrived at the fast-food shop about half an hour after the murder and were caught on camera parking the cab to order sandwiches. “When they left Subway, they took the sandwiches with them, got back into the cab, and drove away,” prosecutors said in the proffer. The pair allegedly proceeded to a gas station to buy drinks in cash. Hours later, Guzman’s cab was caught on camera at the location where the shooting occurred—and even drove past a memorial that was placed in Ortega’s honor, prosecutors said. On Monday, a Chicago police officer stopped Guzman’s cab, where a handgun was allegedly found in the driver’s door compartment. “That gun was recovered, and ballistic testing confirmed that the fired shell casings found at the scene of Melissa’s murder were fired from that handgun,” prosecutors said. “Also recovered from the cab was a fingerprint from the front passenger side interior door handle.” Cell phone data recovered from Guzman’s phone allegedly showed communications between the two deendants, including a video where Guzman admitted to being at the scene of the shootings and that Corripio used his gun. Corripio was arrested on Tuesday. In arguing for no bail, Murphy said the teenager had committed three previous aggravated carjackings in the span of five months and was on “intensive probation” at the time of Ortega’s murder. In a statement to The Daily Beast, Chris Anderson, an assistant Cook County public defender who represented both defendants for the bond hearing, questioned why “the 29-year-old ‘victim’ was not charged with Felony Murder for Mob Action for instigating violence with gang signs that other victim(s) were trying escape from, prior to the shooting.” “It is distressing for a 16-year-old to face an adult criminal system and very troubling that he is automatically treated as an adult in Illinois without consideration of his special circumstances,” Anderson said. “There is simply no explanation as to why shooting a gun that causes death automatically makes a child into an adult. In fact, it is usually due to immaturity that a child may misuse a firearm, not because of maturity!” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/28/2022,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — One of three Philippine election commissioners handling petitions to disqualify late dictator Ferdinand Marcos’ son from the May presidential polls said Thursday that she voted in favor of the petitions and suspected there were efforts to nullify her vote against the leading candidate criticized by human rights groups. Commissioner Rowena Guanzon said she voted to uphold the petitions, which sought Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s disqualification from the race because of a previous tax conviction. An offense of “moral turpitude” is one of the grounds to bar a candidate from seeking and holding public office. Two other commissioners, however, have not disclosed their votes on the petitions. A majority vote is needed to either uphold or reject the petitions, most of which were filed by left-wing and anti-Marcos activists. The 64-year-old Marcos Jr. had already served as a provincial governor and a senator. He has been leading in pre-elections polls to succeed President Rodrigo Duterte. Any ruling by Guanzon and two other commissioners can be appealed. Guanzon said she voted against Marcos' candidacy “because he was convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude,” citing his non-payment of taxes for four years starting in 1982, when he was still governor of northern Ilocos Norte province. Marcos Jr. did not comment immediately. Last week, another group of election commissioners rejected a separate bid to oust Marcos Jr. from the race. The petitioners in that case said he falsely stated that he had not been convicted of any crime. Guanzon said any decision by the Commission on Elections on his candidacy would most likely be challenged before the Supreme Court. Guanzon, who is retiring from the commission on Feb. 2, said she disclosed her vote ahead of two fellow commissioners to preempt what she said was an effort to nullify her vote. “I believe there is political interference here,” she said without elaborating. “They think if I retire, my vote will not count, which is not true.” She tweeted separately without providing details on Thursday: “To whom it may concern: Do not influence the commissioners. And do not try to buy me, threaten me, or seduce me."" The other major contenders for the presidency include Vice President Leni Robredo, an opposition leader who narrowly defeated Marcos Jr. in the 2016 vice presidential race, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, Sen. Panfilo Lacson and former boxing champion Manny Pacquiao. The elder Marcos placed the Philippines under martial rule in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress and newspaper offices, ordered the arrest of political opponents and ruled by decree. He was toppled in an army-backed “people power” revolt in 1986. He died in exile in Hawaii three years later without admitting any wrongdoing, including accusations that he and his family amassed an estimated $5 billion to $10 billion while he was in power. A Hawaii court found him liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extrajudicial killings and disappearances. His widow, Imelda Marcos, and her children were allowed to return to the Philippines in 1991. They have made a political comeback, winning seats in Congress and powerful provincial posts that brought them closer to the top job they said was stolen from them. Marcos Jr. has called the allegations against his father “lies,” angering human rights and pro-democracy activists. He has joined hands with Davao city Mayor Sara Duterte, Duterte’s daughter, as his vice presidential running mate. Duterte backs his daughter’s run but opposes her pairing with Marcos Jr. and has vowed to never support him.",World/Associated Press,Filipino dictator's son loses 1 of 3 votes on elections bid,https://news.yahoo.com/filipino-dictators-son-loses-1-152526070.html
