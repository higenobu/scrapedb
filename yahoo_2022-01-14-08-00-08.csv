1/14/2022,"The RNC is preparing to ban future GOP presidential candidates from participating in debates. Sen. Mitt Romney blasted the plans, telling Insider that it's ""nuts."" ""The American people want to see candidates for president debating issues of consequence to them,"" he said. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah on Thursday blasted the Republican National Committee's plans to prohibit future GOP presidential candidates from participating in debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee and the uncle of current RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, said the decision would deprive the American people of the opportunity to hear candidates ""duke it out."" ""Well, that would be nuts,"" Romney told Insider at the Capitol. ""The American people want to see candidates for president debating issues of consequence to them, and it provides a service to the country and to the people, to hear the prospective candidates of the two major parties duke it out."" The New York Times first reported earlier Thursday that the RNC is preparing to amend its rules, and Insider obtained a letter from the party to the debate commission's co-chairs, Frank Fahrenkopf and Kenneth Wollack. The RNC is concerned about the timing of the 2024 presidential debates, changes to debate procedures without prior notification to the parties, the selection of debate moderators who may represent an alleged conflict of interest, and failure to maintain nonpartisanship among the commission's board members, McDaniel wrote in the letter. The nonpartisan debate commission has existed since 1987 and has sponsored presidential debates dating back to 1988. But Republicans have more recently argued that the commission is biased towards Democrats. Romney told Insider he wasn't familiar with concerns that the commission isn't fair to Republicans. The change hasn't taken effect yet, but an RNC pullout could lead to campaigns directly engaging with each other to set up debates or no debates at all, The Times reported. McDaniel offered a range of proposals for the debate commission, including holding one presidential debate before early voting begins, implementing a code of conduct for the commission's members and staff, and establishing criteria for selecting debate moderators. ""The RNC has a duty to ensure that its future presidential nominees have the opportunity to debate their opponents on a level playing field,"" McDaniel wrote. ""So long as the CPD appears intent on stonewalling the meaningful reforms necessary to restore its credibility with the Republican Party as a fair and nonpartisan actor, the RNC will take every step to ensure that future Republican presidential nominees are given that opportunity elsewhere."" The RNC's proposed rule to require future candidates to sign a pledge not to participate in the debates will be voted on at the committee's meeting in Utah next month, per The Times. The White House on Thursday suggested the RNC was ""afraid"" of participating in debates. —The Recount (@therecount) January 13, 2022 ""The president has participated in many debates over the course of his career and believes they play a role in allowing the American people to hear from candidates and where they stand,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during Thursday's press briefing.

1/14/2022,"For almost three decades, Christine Ching Kui Lee has been a pillar of the Anglo-Chinese community. A wealthy lawyer and campaigner, Ms Lee, from her home in the suburban West Midlands, has been energetic, it is fair to say, in promoting Chinese interests in Britain. Now we know why: the 59-year-old mother of two is a spy. An MI5 investigation, conducted over several years – intelligence agencies refuse to disclose operational details – concluded that Ms Lee is an agent of the Communist Chinese state. The bespectacled, respectable-looking, middle-aged mother from Birmingham had used hundreds of thousands of pounds – if not more – channelled to her by the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing to buy influence that even included access to Downing Street. In the end, MI5 decided enough was enough, and after several years of monitoring Ms Lee’s activities, decided to intervene. At noon on Thursday, MI5 issued to all parliamentarians – that is, MPs and peers – a Security Service Interference Alert that warned them all to steer clear of Ms Lee. For the avoidance of doubt, the notice included her photograph and an assertion that she was seeking to “covertly interfere” in UK politics. Born in China, Ms Lee moved to the UK in the Eighties, setting up home in the Midlands. For the past 20 years, she has operated a successful law firm – the eponymous Christine Lee & Co – with its headquarters in Birmingham and satellite offices in London’s Chinatown and in Beijing, Hong Kong and Guangzhou. From 2015 onwards, the law firm would spend hundreds of thousands of pounds funding the private office of Barry Gardiner, the Labour MP and shadow energy secretary under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Mr Gardiner, but he became a close friend of Ms Lee, employing one of her sons in his private office. He was also a keen advocate of Hinkley Point C power station, a controversial nuclear power plant that was being built in partnership with a Chinese state energy corporation. By 2006, Ms Lee was starting to exert her grip on the UK, establishing the British Chinese Project to “empower” Britain’s Chinese community. The project, it is now suggested, was a front for the suitably named United Front Work Department, an agency of the Chinese Communist Party utilised to exert political influence both in the motherland and overseas. The chairman of the British Chinese Project was Mr Gardiner, who four years later set up an all-party parliamentary group, Chinese in Britain, to represent Chinese citizens in the UK. Again, Mr Gardiner was its chairman and the secretariat listed as Ms Lee’s British Chinese Project. The group has been recently disbanded. It is unclear when Ms Lee was recruited to the cause. But she was so successful that in 2019, she was rewarded for her hard work in promoting good relations in the UK-Chinese community with a prestigious Points of Light Award, given to her by Theresa May, when she was prime minister. “You should feel very proud of the difference that the British Chinese Project is making in promoting engagement, understanding, and co-operation between the Chinese and British communities in the UK,” wrote Mrs May, adding: “I also wish you well with your work to further the inclusion and participation of British-Chinese people in the UK political system.” Ms Lee was delighted. “I am both surprised and honoured to receive this award and feel humbled that it relates to work which I have always felt privileged to carry out,” she responded. “The wellbeing of the British Chinese community in the UK will always be of great importance to me and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to assist in any small way with our integration into UK society.” A photograph of her, beaming as well she might, in front of Number 10 confirmed her pivotal role. The Downing Street entrance was decorated with red banners, proclaiming the Chinese new year. Incredibly at the time Ms Lee made her visit, she was under investigation by MI5. Mrs May was not the only prime minister to give her attention. Four years earlier, Ms Lee was photographed at a British leadership awards ceremony bending the ear of David Cameron when he was PM. However, it was her close association with Mr Gardiner, the MP for Brent North since 1997 and a former Labour minister in Sir Tony Blair’s government, that drew scrutiny. In 2017, The Times reported concern over £180,000 received by Mr Gardiner, at the time Labour’s shadow international trade secretary and previously shadow energy secretary, to pay for staff in his office. It is unclear if the British intelligence agencies were already monitoring Ms Lee’s activities. But if they weren’t, the newspaper report was a wake-up call. In some ways, Ms Lee had been hiding in plain sight. Her law firm boasted of its connections to Beijing as the only British law firm “authorised by the Chinese ministry of justice to practise as a law firm in China”. Ms Lee was also chief legal adviser to the Chinese embassy in London and a legal adviser to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, which in turn was overseen by the Communist Party’s United Front Work Department. The news reporting did not deter her. Between 2015 and 2020, her law firm funded Mr Gardiner’s office to the tune of £420,000. One of Ms Lee’s sons worked for Mr Gardiner as his diary manager and received a parliamentary pass. In a lengthy statement on Thursday, Mr Gardiner said: “I have been liaising with our Security Services for a number of years about Christine Lee and they have always known, and been made fully aware by me, of her engagement with my office and the donations she made to fund researchers in my office in the past.” Mr Gardiner said “steps were taken to ensure Christine Lee had no role in either the appointment or management of those researchers” and that he had not benefited personally from her largesse. He said all donations were properly reported and added: “I have been assured by the Security Services that whilst they have definitively identified improper funding channelled through Christine Lee, this does not relate to any funding received by my office.” He added that Ms Lee’s son had “resigned from my employment earlier today” as a result of MI5’s issuing of its alert, saying: “The Security Services have advised me that they have no intelligence that shows he was aware of, or complicit in, his mother’s illegal activity.” Mr Gardiner admitted speaking to his friend as recently as this week. He denied they had discussed the MI5 alert, insisting he was unaware of it until Thursday. “What we spoke about earlier this week was actually the situation of my parents-in-law, who are elderly and ill,” he told Sky News. “She had expressed concern as to their wellbeing, and that’s what we spoke about.” Mr Gardiner was not her only target. Sir Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrats’ leader, received a £5,000 donation when he was energy secretary in the Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition. He said that the money had gone to his constituency office and at the time had caused no concern. In recent times, Ms Lee has become increasingly emboldened. In December 2019, she attended a banquet at the Chinese embassy in London where Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to the UK at the time, criticised Western nations including Britain for attacking China over pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Ms Lee, according to newspaper reports, told guests that “Western [media] coverage” of the bloody clashes between protesters and riot police, including allegations of police brutality, had “failed to explain the exact true picture”. A photograph emerged on Thursday of her in China shaking hands with Xi Jinping, China’s all-powerful president and scourge of the West. In a local Chinese newspaper, she is quoted recently as saying: “Although I have spent these years in Great Britain, no matter how long the shadow of the tree, the roots forever penetrate the soil… I must be a communicator of China’s voice, let the world understand China, help the motherland develop.” It is unclear the precise trigger for MI5’s startling intervention after years monitoring Ms Lee’s activities. The Security Service Interference Alert declares its “purpose is to draw attention to individuals knowingly engaged in political interference activities on behalf of the United Front Work department of the Chinese Communist Party”. Intelligence agencies investigated the money trail and traced the source of her funding to the Chinese Communist Party. Whitehall sources said she had not conducted “conventional espionage”, but had deployed a more “subtle and nuanced” method to exert influence on British policy. “This is about her getting herself into positions where she has levers of power to pull,” said a Whitehall source. “We didn’t want to see her keep going.” Security services decided to intervene and go public when they concluded that the “risk of harm” she posed in influencing public figures outweighed the benefits of keeping secret tabs on her. “The accumulated risks of not doing something were higher than intervening,” said a source, adding: “We believe that ultimately she was taking money from the Chinese communist party in order to influence parliamentarians.” Sources said that Ms Lee was not the only Chinese agent operating in the UK in this way, but refused to speculate on the scale of the problem. Intelligence agencies have repeatedly claimed that out-of-date espionage laws, based on the Official Secrets Act of 1911, make it difficult to arrest and charge foreign spies. Ms Lee is unlikely to face charges while her deportation is also unlikely to proceed. She is understood to be a naturalised British citizen with a husband and children in the UK. On Thursday, Ms Lee had gone to ground at the family home in Solihull, bought last year for £985,000. Her Mercedes with a personalised licence plate, including a lucky Chinese number, was parked in the drive. The Chinese spy had run out of road.",World/The Telegraph,"Christine Lee: Lawyer, mother-of-two, pillar of Anglo-Chinese community ... and spy",https://news.yahoo.com/christine-lee-lawyer-mother-two-210433938.html
1/14/2022,"President Joe Biden took two huge losses Thursday that likely will be the final nails in the coffin of the big and hopeful agenda that Democrats were counting on as we speed into the 2022 election season from hell. First, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a fellow Democrat, announced that although she supports the voting rights bill, she's not willing to do what it would take to make it happen. The filibuster. I'm talking about killing the filibuster. This came only two days after the president made such an impassioned speech in support of knocking off the filibuster that Republicans essentially called it offensive. And even one Democratic senator said Biden, who pledged a year ago to unite Americans, went too far in the speech. Opinions in your inbox: Get a digest of our takes on current events every day Former President Barack Obama even came out of political retirement to write his first opinion piece since leaving office about the importance of protecting voter suppression. He said, in this USA TODAY Opinion piece, that it’s time for Democrats to do something, anything, to protect democracy. Sinema didn’t get the memo. Then, President Joe barely had time to shake off Sinema's body slam Thursday afternoon when the U.S. Supreme Court knocked him down again. The court ruled that the Biden administration doesn't have the authority to force employers to require that workers either have to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing for COVID. The employer mandate was a key part of Biden's attempt to get control of a pandemic that has proven to be uncontrollable. Basically, if voter suppression and helping spread the latest COVID variant are on your to-do list, now is your time to shine. Too bad for Democrats and Biden's agenda, his shine is wearing off. And these latest setbacks land at exactly the wrong time for an administration reeling from confusing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, supply chain shortages that won't end, the highest inflation rate since the early days of the Reagan presidency, and an approval rating that makes former President Donald Trump look like the most popular kid in school. So what's next? What other losses can this administration take? I think we'll see that answer soon enough when voters turn out for the 2022 midterm. To put into context how bad things are for Biden, my sister texted me Wednesday: “He’s a failure.” And that was before Sinema and the Supremes had their say.

1/14/2022,"TULSA, Okla. (AP) — State and federal authorities announced Thursday that they arrested and charged more than two dozen people for taking part in a multistate shoplifting ring that made off with more than $10 million in stolen goods over the past few years, most of which was over-the-counter medications. U.S. Attorney Clint Johnson in Tulsa and Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor announced state and federal charges against 29 defendants. Johnson said 25 of those charged had been arrested and four others were still at large. Prosecutors said the defendants took part in a conspiracy to steal mostly over-the-counter medications from retailers such as Walmart, Costco, Walgreens, CVS and GNC in Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. The ringleaders would then arrange for the sale of the items on websites such as Amazon and eBay. “Consumers and businesses incur a high price for thieves who commit larcenies and profit by selling their stolen goods to well-organized theft rings,” said Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin, whose department launched its investigation in 2019 after an organized crime investigator from a pharmacy retailer shared information about bulk thefts from its Tulsa-area locations. “Thieves should take notice. Tulsa is not going to capitulate and allow criminals to disrupt commerce in our city.” Prosecutors allege that a 48-year-old Tulsa woman, Linda Been, led the ring, which netted an estimated $4.5 million from the sale of stolen goods such as Flonase, Mucinex, Nexium and Allegra to fencing organizations outside of Oklahoma that then sold the merchandise on e-commerce sites. They allege that Been, whose name is listed in jail records as Linda Gann, would provide shoplifters with a detailed list of items to steal and pay for their expenses when they traveled out of state. She also would pay for the shoplifters' bond if they were arrested, prosecutors allege.
