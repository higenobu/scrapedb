3/6/2022,"In times of global crisis, central banks watch for signs of panic in the financial markets. On 3 March 2020, when it became clear to investors that Covid-19 posed a significant threat to the global economy, a sudden flight to safety threatened to turn into a full-scale stampede. With sellers dramatically outnumbering buyers, central banks found themselves riding to the rescue. In Britain, the Bank of England spent £200bn in its role as buyer of last resort. This week the Bank will attempt to draw a line under the pandemic by becoming a seller again, albeit by simply not repurchasing government bonds it currently holds. On 7 March, about £30bn of UK gilts will mature and the Bank will allow other investors – probably insurance companies and banks – to buy them, rather than reinvesting the proceeds itself. Officials in Threadneedle Street are also expected to make progress offloading £20bn of loans to big corporations that made up a small slice of the £895bn in quantitative easing it has utilised since 2008. Within the next few months the value of the QE programme, which was started in response to the 2008 banking crash, will have dropped to £847bn, which is still much higher than its pre-pandemic total, but heading in a direction that appears to show normal, pre-pandemic service from the central bank being resumed. So far the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russian banks and oligarchs is not enough to make Threadneedle Street change course. But Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at consultancy Oxford Economics, says the conflict will make the Bank more cautious. After the March sale, only £9bn of the remaining £847bn will be left still to mature in 2022, which means the Bank will need to actively sell bonds if it wants to make a large dent in its QE debt pile. “UK banks are not showing any signs of stress, so the current plan is likely to remain in place,” Goodwin says. “But the lack of maturing bonds means the bank will need to be more proactive to keep up the momentum, and with the current uncertainties, sales are likely to be limited.” The war will probably have a bigger effect on interest rates, which he thinks might now increase by only 0.5 percentage points to 1%, and stay there. Before the Ukraine invasion, investors were expecting interest rates in the UK to hit 1.75% by December and 2% by the middle of next year. Goodwin says governor Andrew Bailey’s fears over workers securing inflation-busting wage rises over the coming months, triggering a wage/price spiral, are unlikely to materialise and that the main impact of higher gas and oil prices will be to cause a severe hit to household finances. Consumer confidence surveys were indicating before the war started that shoppers would be keeping their wallets shut while they coped with rising bills, taxes and interest rates. Between 70% and 80% of GDP growth is accounted for by consumer spending, and the recent fall in measures of confidence signal that economic growth could slow or go into reverse – even without further interest rate rises. The same pressures are bearing down on the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday. George Buckley, economist at Nomura, thinks the ECB is likely to “put on ice” any threat of higher interest rates. ECB president Christine Lagarde is also expected to leave in place a schedule of monthly additions to QE that is on course – but will see additions reduced from €40bn to €30bn in the third quarter and €20bn from October onwards. However, a prolonged war that spurs the west to slap more sanctions on Russia and Belarus will hand Lagarde and her counterparts in the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve a huge dilemma. Salman Ahmed, global head of macroeconomics at stockbroker Fidelity International, says it amounts to an “unenviable choice” that will leave them upsetting lots of people. “The Fed, ECB and Bank of England were already wrestling with higher inflation and slowing growth. The Ukraine war has not changed those fundamentals, but it is likely to exacerbate both. Policymakers are facing an unenviable choice between acting hawkish to get inflation under control at the risk of meaningfully damaging growth, and letting inflation run unchecked in order to protect growth as much as possible.”",News/Business,"Bank of England puts Covid behind it, but now must face costs of war",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/06/bank-puts-covid-behind-it-but-faces-repercussions-of-war

3/6/2022,"Visa and Mastercard have announced tonight they will be suspending operations in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Visa said in a statement that it would cut off transactions “over the coming days” and consequently cards issued in Russia would not work abroad as well as foreign issued cards in Russia. Alfred Kelly, chairman and chief executive officer of the US-based digital payments company, said: “We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed. “We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. “This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.” Mastercard issued a similar ban, stating that cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by its network. The US-based company added that any Mastercard issued outside the country would not work at Russian merchants or ATMs. Mastercard said: “For more than a week, the world has watched the shocking and devastating events resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “Our colleagues, our customers and our partners have been affected in ways that most of us could not imagine. “We don’t take this decision lightly. Mastercard has operated in Russia for more than 25 years. “We have nearly 200 colleagues there who make this company so critical to many stakeholders. “As we take these steps, we will continue to focus on their safety and wellbeing, including continuing to provide pay and benefits.” The Ukrainian government had previously called on the financial companies to suspend operations in Russia. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had urged the companies to take this action when he talked by video to American members of Congress earlier today.",News/World news,Visa and Mastercard will both suspend operations in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/05/visa-and-mastercard-will-both-suspend-operations-in-russia
3/6/2022,"Viktor Hovland held a four-shot lead for a Saturday afternoon spell at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. As the opposition wilted, it appeared a straightforward case of the young Norwegian’s march towards the summit of world golf continuing courtesy of a seventh professional victory. Not so fast, declared Bay Hill. By close of play, Hovland sat one adrift of Billy Horschel and Talor Gooch. Hovland’s 74 – he missed a par putt from 11ft on the last – means a six-under-par aggregate. He was minus 10 when leading all around him a merry dance. As is typical, this event is incredibly hard to call. Horschel is the man with momentum; his back nine of 34 was one better than Gooch and superior to Hovland by six. On a wonderfully compacted leaderboard, it would be unwise to discount anybody within half a dozen shots. Keeping the ball on the fairway remains the key to happiness. “The rough is US Open rough out here,” said Gary Woodland, who is four under. “It’s brutal.” Scottie Scheffler is one ahead of Woodland. For so long, Hovland stood firm. He dropped shots in each of his first two holes, offset by a fantastic hole-out from a bunker for an eagle at the 6th. Hovland’s birdie at the 8th felt like more than a one-shot boost, given the troubles of others on the leaderboard at the same hole. Yet Bay Hill becomes increasingly treacherous as darkness edges closer. This proved as good as it got for Hovland. Aberrations at the 11th and 14th allowed Gooch to move within one and Horschel to sit only two adrift. When Hovland made bogey at the 17th, he found himself in a tie. Horschel reached seven under with a terrific birdie converted from the fringe of the 18th green. “It would be very special to win here,” said Horschel. “I grew up an hour from here, came here as a kid, caddied in the Pro-Am multiple times. I have a lot of family and friend support around here. Then you add on Arnold Palmer’s name to it. It would be something very special. But I’ve got to do a really good job of controlling my emotions more and not getting ahead of myself.” Rory McIlroy was already plus two for his round before his drive at the 11th bounced high from a cart path. The Northern Irishman, now stuck against a boundary fence, could only advance his ball to within 80 yards of the green with a dropped shot leaving him six shy of Hovland. McIlroy responded admirably, producing birdies at the 12th and 13th as Hovland, too, bogeyed the 11th. Yet this was a round in which McIlroy constantly looked to be battling technical issues. He cracked a tee shot out of bounds at the 15th, with a double bogey there sliding him back to four under. A birdie, bogey, bogey finish all added up to 76. “It’s so tough out there, it’s so tricky,” McIlroy said. “It’s just on a knife edge, like you’re literally talking feet. Two feet here, two feet there from 200 yards can make a huge difference in where the ball ends up. It’s hard not to get frustrated.” McIlroy cannot be discounted at minus three but he will have to improve significantly on day four. Graeme McDowell, looking to earn one of three berths in the Open Championship that are available here, is alongside McIlroy. Much earlier, Matt Jones was forced to complete his round minus a putter after flinging said club deep into alligator-infested waters at the 11th. Jones was a single shot over par for his round at that point and had merely missed a birdie putt from 8ft, which rendered his outburst rather odd. He played his closing stretch in plus three before offering a firm “Nope” when asked whether he was of a mind to discuss the putter incident. Jones did not even break stride.",Sport/Sport,Gooch and Horschel share Bay Hill lead as Hovland falters and McIlroy drifts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/talor-gooch-and-billy-horschel-share-lead-before-final-round-at-bay-hill
