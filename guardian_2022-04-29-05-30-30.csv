4/29/2022,"It’s only a short walk from the ECB headquarters out of Lord’s, but it took Rob Key a long time to complete it after he’d finished his first press conference as the managing director of the England men’s team. He was stopped by a Middlesex fan who wanted him to record a good luck message for a friend’s wedding, another who asked him to pose for a selfie, a gaggle of kids who wanted his autograph, a teacher who asked him to take a group photo with her class, and a steward who just wanted to wish him well in his new job. “Good luck Rob!” the steward said. “You’ll need it!” You guess a lot of his conversations end that way these days. The ECB still don’t have a chairman. They just announced that they are restarting the recruitment process because they haven’t been able to find anyone who meets the criteria. They still don’t have a head coach or head selector for their men’s team, who are bottom of the World Test Championship table and are due to play a Test series against New Zealand, the world champions, in 35 days. They are also waiting on two major reviews – one into the culture of their teams and another into the structure of their cricket, commissioned by a chief executive who has intimated that he may step down before they’ve reported. Key’s plan is to lead them out of this mess one step at a time. He has already picked his skipper and says he is confident that he will be able to hire a coach in time for the first Test. After that he will appoint a head selector too, unpicking one of the key decisions made by his predecessor, Ashley Giles, who folded the role into the head coach’s remit. Key doesn’t have any idea yet who it might be – “We won’t rush it, because I’d rather have someone really good” – and in the meantime he’ll help pick the team himself. But his main worry is making sure he gets the best people in these three jobs. “Then we’ll build the structures around them.” Key has the knack of making it all sound very simple. He speaks in plain English, which is a help, and manages to get through the best part of an hour’s talking without taking any positives, or executing any skills, or mentioning any of his key performance indicators or delivery networks. “You’re not trying to solve climate change or anything like that,” Key says. “Just make the best possible decisions on cricket, manage people to the best of your ability and make sure everyone’s on the right track. There’s not much else.” He suggests that England’s thinking got overcomplicated during the pandemic, and he’s right. Of course he wants Ben Stokes to be captain, because he was the obvious choice, and of course he wants Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad to be in the squad, because they’re the best bowlers available – “and in Test cricket, if there’s one thing we’ve got to do it’s pick our best team”. As for rotation and the rest: “I don’t think we have to overthink all this stuff. If they play the first Test match and if they’re bowling really well and England are doing well, then they might play the next and then if they bowl well in that one, then on to the next and then if they’re tired then someone else can come in.” Likewise, if the schedule means there are times when players have to miss some white-ball cricket to ensure they’re in the best shape to play Test matches, so be it. “But I’m not going to tell you that they are not going to play a game in six months. We’ve just got to be flexible about it.” Trouble is, events have a way of making everything more complicated. Key got a taste of it when he made an off-the-cuff remark about Nottinghamshire’s Joe Clarke, whose friend and teammate Alex Hepburn was found guilty of rape in 2019. There are plenty of cricket fans who haven’t forgiven Clarke for his role in the case, and the messages he sent Hepburn on WhatsApp. Key found he had talked himself into a corner where he had to extemporise an answer about whether or not Clarke should be picked for England. “I’ll have to look into exactly what’s gone on in the past, but for me, I see no reason why not.” There are plenty more hard questions ahead, and they’ll need sharper answers. Behind all that straightforward talk about taking it one step at a time, Key did sound a bit like a man who is figuring the best way ahead as he walks along. He says he’ll be guided by the principle “do what’s best for English cricket”. But, as he said himself, the ECB is, and always has been, full of people trying to do exactly that. And they still ended up in this position. The test of Key’s ability will be whether he gets those decisions right or not. He says that’s what drew him to the job. After all those conversations on Sky about how the ECB ought to run the game, he wanted to see whether his ideas about the Test team, the domestic schedule, the IPL and all the rest of it worked in the real world. Well, as the man said, good luck Rob. You’ll need it.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key aims to keep it simple as he attempts to revive England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/rob-key-aims-to-keep-it-simple-as-he-attempts-to-revive-england
4/29/2022,"Virtually every home in the UK is subjected to air pollution above World Health Organization guidelines, according to the most detailed map of dirty air to date. More than 97% of addresses exceed WHO limits for at least one of three key pollutants, while 70% of addresses breach WHO limits for all three. The map, produced by the non-profit group the Central Office of Public Interest (Copi) and Imperial College London, combined 20,000 measurements with computer modelling to produce pollution estimates every 20 metres across the country. People can check their address at the website addresspollution.org for free. The website also ranks each address against national pollution levels. For example, Buckingham Palace in London is in the 98th percentile, with highly polluted air, while Balmoral Castle in Scotland is in the zero percentile, with the cleanest air. The towns and cities with the highest proportion of homes in the top 10% most polluted nationally are Slough in Berkshire, with 90%, followed by London, with 66%. Others in the worst 10 include Portsmouth, Leeds, Manchester and Reading. Copi is calling for a legal requirement for air pollution data to be disclosed to home buyers and renters, as is already the case with asbestos, for example. “Air pollution affects all of us. With this new accurate data now publicly available, it would be shameful for the property industry to not start acting transparently – lives depend on it,” said Humphrey Milles, the founder of Copi, which promotes public awareness campaigns on issues it says are being neglected by government. The WHO sharply reduced its guideline limits for air pollution in September, to reflect the increasing scientific evidence of the harm to health caused by toxic air. A 2019 review concluded that air pollution may be damaging every organ in the body, causing at least 7 million early deaths a year worldwide and about 40,000 in the UK. The WHO says air pollution is the biggest environmental threat to human health and is a public health emergency. The UK’s legal limit for nitrogen dioxide is four times higher than the new WHO limit, but is still not met in most urban areas. The country’s legal limit for tiny particles less than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5) is five times higher than the WHO limit, while the UK limit for PM10 is 2.7 times higher. The air pollution campaigner Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: “This new data shows yet again that the government is failing the British public. Now people can really see the filthy air they’re breathing at their home, school or work address. Everyone needs to know what they’re breathing, and now with this new public service they can.” Kissi-Debrah’s nine-year old daughter Ella died in 2013, and a landmark coroner’s ruling later cited air pollution as a cause of death. The coroner then issued an official “report to prevent future deaths” in April 2021, which said: “Greater awareness [of air pollution] would help individuals reduce their personal exposure to air pollution. Publicising this information is an issue that needs to be addressed by national as well as local government.” Prof Sir Stephen Holgate, a special adviser on air pollution to the Royal College of Physicians, said: “Air pollution is an invisible killer, and it’s easy for people to forget and ignore. It’s essential that the public are given air pollution data for where they are thinking of buying or renting. In many cases like that of little Ella, it can be a matter of life or death.” Rebecca Marsh, the UK’s property ombudsman, said: “Air pollution is information all consumers should be aware of before they make a decision on a specific property. Arguably, this is material information that all sellers or landlords should be providing.” The map shows annual average pollution levels for 2019, the last year that was unaffected by Covid-19 lockdowns and travel restrictions. Even using the previous higher WHO guidelines, 55% of UK addresses would still breach the limit for at least one of the three pollutants. Sean Beevers, a researcher at Imperial College, said: “It is not just a London problem, so people should be thinking about air pollution more. What had previously been seen as reasonable levels have now been thrown out the window.” Beevers said, however, that the models were not perfect and cautioned against seeing places with slightly higher estimates of air pollution as necessarily worse than nearby places with slightly lower pollution.",News/Environment,"Dirty air affects 97% of UK homes, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/dirty-air-affects-97-of-uk-homes-data-shows
4/29/2022,"A 77-year-old white South African farm owner has appeared in court after shooting and wounding a black woman he claimed he mistook for a hippopotamus. Paul Hendrik van Zyl, was arrested on Tuesday after “firing shots in the direction of the woman”, Ramokone Linah, who was fishing with her partner in a river in Lephalale town, northern Limpopo province. Van Zyl faces attempted murder charges, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). “The arrested suspect alleged that he was shooting at the animals” police spokesperson, Mamphaswa Seabi, said in a statement. Linah, 38, sustained gun shot wounds on her arm, while her partner “managed to hide” before informing police and emergency services, police said. The accused “is the owner of the farm where the incident occurred”, said Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, NPA spokesperson in the province. Police seized two rifles, one revolver, one pistol, and two airguns during the arrest. Deep racial divisions remain in South Africa 28 years after the end of white minority apartheid rule, and such incidents frequently cause outrage. According to one local media report, the victim was part of a group of local men and women who had been fishing in a river near Mamojela Park, an informal settlement outside the mining town of Lephalale, since mid-morning. The shooting occurred in the early afternoon. Witnesses said van Zyl had fired at the group from the other riverbank and had been heard to tell police that he had aimed at what he thought were “hippos and monkeys”. A group of opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters staged a protest about the granting of bail outside the court, according to the party’s posts on Twitter. Hendrik was freed on 1,000 rand ($62) bail and the case was postponed for further investigations to 18 May. In a country where firearms are common, fatal accidents occur often, with about 250 people killed in 2018. According to 2019-2020 police crime statistics, more than 7,000 murders with guns were reported in South Africa. In a similar incident five years ago, a South African farmer was accused of wounding a farm worker with a pellet gun after “mistaking him for a monkey”. The incident also took place in Limpopo province.",News/World news,White South African in court for shooting black woman he claims he ‘mistook for hippo’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/white-south-african-in-court-for-shooting-black-woman-on-his-farm
4/29/2022,"“We’re a cash machine at these types of prices,” Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, cheerfully declared last November when the price of a barrel of Brent fetched $85 (£60). Now a barrel costs $105, so it’s safe to predict that BP will be swimming in dollars when it reports first-quarter profits next Tuesday, even allowing for its well-flagged whack from getting out of Russia. The billions on show on Thursday at Shell, the larger company, will be even greater. Cue another round of debate about the merits of a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. Thus Rishi Sunak, at the very least, was being politically smart this week in fudging his stance. The chancellor has previously been a firm opponent of a windfall tax, arguing it would discourage investment, the very thing he is trying to accelerate during an energy crisis that is partly about security of supply. Now he’s not so sure, or so he seemed to suggest to the Mumsnet website. “Nothing is ever off the table” if companies don’t ramp up investment in new projects, he said. A U-turn still feels a long way off given the force of past statements; and note that Sunak’s interesting remark was preceded by a longer defence about why he hasn’t taken the windfall route, and how oil and gas producers are already paying tax at an effective rate of 40%. Perhaps the comment was just a prod to Looney to stop boasting about his cash machine and start hyping the BP billions going into UK windfarms, carbon-capture projects, hydrogen developments and electric charging points. Yet one comes back to that high oil price – or, rather, to its persistence. It is impossible to be precise about the “war in Ukraine premium” in current oil and gas prices, but it obviously exists – and it is a premium being enjoyed by companies and being paid by consumers. The longer it lasts, the harder it is to resist rejigging the balance in the interest of fairness. Yes, the companies would grumble. But, if the sum was as little as £3bn, as some models suggest, the bleating would quickly fade as long as windfall taxes were still seen to apply only rarely. Boards would get back to modelling returns over a decade, which is what really drives their investment decisions. Having opened the door, Sunak would be wise to keep it open. Come the autumn, when consumers’ bills will rise again, the political pressure may be overwhelming. Supermarkets are a good place for investors to hide during periods of high inflation, runs traditional thinking, since food is always in demand and higher prices on shelves should eventually provide some protection. Life is more complicated, however, when inflation combines with a cost of living squeeze and a possible consumer recession. Sainsbury’s comments about “significant external pressures and uncertainties” says the outlook is genuinely unclear. In the absence of a takeover bid – on which front, the chat has gone quiet after last year’s entertainment at Asda and Morrisons – it’s a case of giving thanks for the dividend, lifted by almost a quarter with Thursday’s full-year numbers. Pre-tax profits in the current financial year are predicted to fall from £730m to anywhere between £630m and £690m, a wide range that was reflected in Sainsbury’s chief executive Simon Roberts’ description of consumer mood. In the same sentence, he used “early signs” of caution, which sounds tolerable from the point of view of the shopkeeper, and “watching every penny, every pound”, which is several notches more severe. Sainsbury’s is far from helpless, it should be said. It can find cost savings, as it always does, and the Argos combo should have more efficiencies to yield. Confidence that free cashflow this year will be “at least” £500m provides freedom to react to events – certainly more freedom than enjoyed by the heavily indebted buyout brigade. Sainsbury’s balance sheet is strong, a slice of market share has been gained and the freshly tweaked dividend policy is to be slightly more generous with the payout as a proportion of earnings. So, yes, the investment caricature of stability is roughly intact. But one can also see why the shares, down 4%, were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index. Boards everywhere in retail-land are erring on the side of caution amid uncertainty, and may be right to do so.",News/Business,Sunak would do well to retain option of windfall tax on oil and gas profits,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/28/rishi-sunak-would-do-well-to-stick-with-windfall-tax-u-turn
4/29/2022,"Sex crimes logged by police in England and Wales have reached a record high amid warnings from the victims’ commissioner that the government’s aim to boost prosecutions to levels last seen five years ago is “a pipe dream”. Police-recorded sexual offences increased to their highest level over a 12-month period, with 183,587 in the year to December 2021, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The figures, which include cases of rape, stalking, spiking and domestic abuse, represent a 22% increase on 2020 and 13% on 2019. About 37% of sexual offences recorded were rapes, which rose 21% from 55,592 in the year to December 2020. Vera Baird, the victims’ commissioner for England and Wales, said the increase in reported rapes contrasted with the low number of prosecutions and left the government with little hope of reaching its goal of returning to 2016-17 prosecution levels of 5,190 cases a year. They fell nearly 60% in four years to 2,102 in 2019-20 even as the number of reports to police increased. “Record levels of victims are coming forward, but the charging rate remains in the doldrums. The marked increase in victim reporting is simply not translating into increased referrals and charges,” Baird said. “Close to a year since the publication of the government’s end-to-end rape review, we are yet to see any substantive improvement. The government’s promise to return to 2016-17 levels of prosecutions by the end of this parliament remains a pipe dream.” The increase in reported sex crimes may reflect a number of factors, the ONS said, including the “impact of high-profile incidents, media coverage and campaigns on people’s willingness to report incidents to the police, as well as a potential increase in the number of victims.” The rape and murder of Sarah Everard in March 2021 prompted a national debate over women’s safety, sexual violence and the response of police and prosecutors. Police forces have launched campaigns to encourage victims to come forward. Home Office figures also show that the proportion of all offences resulting in a charge fell in a year from 7.5% to 5.8%, not much more than a third of the rate of 15.5% in 2014-15 when records began. Total police-recorded crime was lowest in the first quarter of the year (January-March 2021) when there were major Covid lockdowns, but from April recorded crime returned to the levels seen before the pandemic, the ONS report said. It added: “Since restrictions were lifted following the third national lockdown in early 2021, police-recorded crime data show indications that certain offence types are returning to or exceeding the levels seen before the pandemic. While violence and sexual offences recorded by the police have exceeded pre-pandemic levels, theft offences and robbery remain at a lower level despite increases over the last nine months.” Overall police-recorded violence increased by 13% in a year, from nearly 1.8m offences to more than 2m in the year ending December 2021. Diana Fawcett, the chief executive of the charity Victim Support, said: “We are seriously concerned that sexual offences have reached a record high for the second year in a row. Sadly, these figures reflect what we’re seeing – the number of sexual violence cases referred to us have increased by a third since before the pandemic.” A Home Office source said the government was committed to reducing murder, neighbourhood crimes such as robbery and serious violence through a “Beating the Crime” plan announced by Boris Johnson in October. “Official statistics out today demonstrate that the Beating the Crime plan is working, with neighbourhood crime down by 31% and hospital admissions for under-25s as a result of assaults with a knife or sharp object down by 19% since June 2019. But there is much more work to do to reduce the number of lives being lost, so the government will continue backing the police to be relentless in their pursuit of violent criminals.”",News/UK news,Recorded sex crimes reach record high in England and Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/28/sex-crimes-record-high-england-wales-prosecution-levels
4/29/2022,"Boris Johnson is under increasing pressure to take immediate disciplinary action against the Conservative MP accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons. The chief whip issued a statement on Wednesday suggesting the matter should be referred to parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which deals with sexual harassment and other disciplinary matters. But senior Tories questioned why he had not taken action directly against the MP, whose alleged behaviour was witnessed by two female colleagues in recent months. The identity of the MP is known to party whips, it is understood, but sources denied suggestions the MP was himself a whip. One cabinet minister described the situation as “madness all round”, while Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, said: “I hope the chief withdraws the whip. In any other workplace they would be on gardening leave.” Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, was present at a meeting of the “2022 committee” – a group of Tory women – earlier this week, when a series of incidents, including the MP watching pornography, were described. On Thursday the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on Johnson to bypass the potentially lengthy ICGS process, and discipline the MP directly. “This is an unusual case because the Tory party knows who this individual is. I think that they should deal with it, and deal with it sooner rather than later … They know who this is. They should take action now,” he said. Misogyny and sexism in parliament have come under close scrutiny in recent days, after a widely criticised Mail on Sunday story claimed Tory MPs believed Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, crossed and uncrossed her legs to distract Johnson at prime minister’s questions. Asked whether the MP accused of watching pornography should lose the whip, the prime minister insisted on Thursday that the case should be investigated independently. It was “obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace” but “what needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts,” Johnson said. A spokesperson for the whips’ office said: “This is the best way of handling this, because they can look at everything fairly, independently. This is the best process that we could have in place to deal with this matter.” At least five cabinet ministers have expressed alarm privately or publicly about the reports. Earlier in the day, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, said some MPs behaved like “animals”, and talked about a “coarsening” of behaviour in parliament and elsewhere. “I think this is something that does happen in many, if not all, workplaces, where a small minority of men – and it is men – are behaving in an unacceptable way,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. “I think that’s actually a more worrying symptom of our society and our culture. How have we got to a place in our society where watching pornography on the tube, in public, in front of children, in parliament, in the workplace has become somehow normalised for some people?” Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, told the BBC: “I’ve been around a while and I think it’s actually getting worse [for female MPs] … I always thought that, get more women in … things will get better, but sadly I don’t see that happening at the moment. I think we just need to have a majority of women maybe. So it’s just disappointing.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: “There have been several instances of inappropriate and sexist behaviour recently in parliament. It is shameful. Parliamentarians are public servants and it is their duty to set an example of character and integrity. The culture of Westminster needs to change.”",News/Politics,Senior Tories pressure Johnson to act now on MP accused of watching porn,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/johnson-must-act-now-on-mp-accused-of-watching-porn-in-commons-starmer
4/29/2022,"Ukraine’s prosecutor general has named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha. Iryna Venediktova also told German TV that that Ukranian investigators had identified “more than 8,000 cases” of suspected war crimes since Russia’s invasion, which included accusations of “killing civilians, bombing of civilian infrastructure, torture” and “sexual crimes”. Her comments came as the international criminal court (ICC) ramps up its investigation into alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine since the start of the war. The Dutch government will “very soon” send a team of “several dozen” forensic specialists to Ukraine on behalf of the ICC to gather evidence of human rights abuses, the ANP press agency reported on Thursday. Russian forces’ retreat from Kyiv in early April left horrifying evidence of atrocities littered across the region’s suburbs and towns, where scores of bodies in civilian clothes were found lying in the streets or buried in shallow graves. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Venediktova identified 10 soldiers – two sergeants, four corporals and four privates – who she said were all “involved in the torture of peaceful people” during the brutal occupation of Bucha, a small commuter town 18.5 miles north-west of Kyiv. Venediktova said the soldiers were part of the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade, a unit based in the Khabarovsk region, on the Pacific coast in Russia’s far east. “During the occupation of Bucha, they took unarmed civilians hostage, killed them with hunger and thirst, and kept them on their knees with their hands tied and their eyes taped. [The hostages] were mocked and beaten with fists and the rifle stocks. They were beaten for information about the location of the [Ukrainian] armed forces … and some were tortured for no reason at all,” she wrote. Venediktova appealed to the public to help gather evidence, and said that Ukrainian prosecutors and police officers are now investigating whether any of the men were also involved in homicides. Ukraine, together with a number of western countries and human rights organisations, has accused Russian forces of summarily killing civilians in Bucha. Stanislav Kozynchuk, the deputy head of the prosecutor’s office for the Kyiv region, said that investigators are working with victims to identify the perpetrators of human rights abuses. “Our suspects are military personnel from the Russian Federation,” he said. “We understand who was there, what happened, and now we are looking into these military units which participated in the killings.” Some of the implicated soldiers have already been redeployed to fight in eastern Ukraine, he said. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch said that “Russian forces committed a litany of apparent war crimes during their occupation” of the town, adding that ​​investigators “found extensive evidence of summary executions, other unlawful killings, enforced disappearances and torture, all of which would constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity.” The Guardian has reported that dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s defence ministry identified Russia’s 64th Motor Rifle Brigade as the unit that had occupied Bucha, publishing the names, ranks and passport details of all the soldiers. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged human rights abuses, while Russian state television has aired reports claiming that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were staged or the result of crimes committed by Ukrainian forces. During a meeting with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, in the Kremlin on Tuesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that “Russian forces had no connections to Bucha.” “We know who did it. We know who prepared this provocation … We know who they are,” Putin added, without providing further details. Earlier this month, Putin awarded the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the honorary title of “guards” and praised the unit for its “great heroism and courage”. “This high distinction recognises your special merits, great heroism and courage in defending your Fatherland, and in protecting Russia’s sovereignty and national interests,” Putin’s statement said.",News/World news,Ukraine names 10 Russian soldiers in alleged human rights abuses in Bucha ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/ukraine-names-10-russian-soldiers-in-alleged-human-rights-abuses-in-bucha
4/29/2022,"Ministers have been accused of “bending the rules to dodge scrutiny” after Downing Street missed the deadline for publishing the security advice it received about granting Evgeny Lebedev a peerage. MPs voted last month for the material to be released after reports that MI5 raised security concerns when the Evening Standard owner and son of a KGB officer was nominated by Boris Johnson to join the House of Lords in March 2020. Labour used an opposition day in the Commons to table a “humble address” – a type of motion that forces the government to release documents that was rarely used until a few years ago. Conservative whips were initially expected to order their MPs to vote against the move, all but ensuring it would fail – but a sizeable number of rebels made clear they were not prepared to do so, forcing the government to allow abstentions. The deadline for publishing the advice about Lord Lebedev’s peerage was 28 April. But the Cabinet Office minister admitted after parliament was prorogued in preparation for the Queen’s speech that work retracting some bits of information had not been finished. Michael Ellis claimed redactions needed to be made “for the purposes of national security”, which he said was “a consideration which is of upmost importance given the government’s responsibility to protect information when disclosure is not in the public interest”. The minister said the government was also “giving considerations to other principles, such as the need to protect the data of private individuals, communications with Her Majesty and also to the conferring by the crown of any honour or dignity”. He confirmed all the security services’ advice “has now been collated” but said that “all necessary considerations” had not been completed and that he regretted missing the deadline. Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, claimed that by failing to release the documents, the government was “once again bending the rules to dodge scrutiny”. She said: “This last-minute delay just kicks the can further down the road, and has all the hallmarks of a government with something to hide. “If the prime minister wasn’t involved in forcing through the appointment of an individual of concern to our intelligence services, why won’t he come clean and publish the guidance in full, as parliament voted for?” Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s former chief adviser, said last month that he was in the room when Cabinet Office officials told Johnson the intelligence services had “serious reservations about the PM’s plan”. Johnson has previously denied he intervened to secure a peerage, and Lebedev said that he was not an “agent of Russia”.",News/Media,Tories ‘bending the rules’ after missing deadline for publishing Lebedev advice,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/28/tories-missing-deadline-publishing-mi5-evgeny-lebedev-advice
4/29/2022,"Keir Starmer and senior shadow cabinet ministers have launched a charm offensive while hosting officials from Israel’s Labor party, including taking them door-knocking for the local elections in Barnet, north London. In move designed to underline the contrast with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Starmer and Rayner have hosted nine officials including the deputy mayor of Tel Aviv, Chen Arieli, the party’s chief executive, Nir Rosen, and senior staffers from the Israeli leader’s office. The Guardian understands the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, hosted the delegation for dinner and the group also met the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and discussed campaign tactics with senior figures in Labour HQ including the general secretary, David Evans, and campaign director Morgan McSweeney. Though they have long been “sister parties”, the previous leader, Avi Gabbay, cut ties with Corbyn in 2018 over the handling of antisemitism within the Labour party. Once a dominant force in the country, Israel’s Labor has also been in political turmoil, suffering some of its worst results in multiple elections over the past few years, though it is now part of the shaky governing coalition with a small increase in seats. Jonathan Cummings, international adviser to the Israeli Labor leader, Merav Michaeli, said it was a “great relief” to be in contact with the party and said they were struck by the time they had been given by senior politicians. “Our main concern was always about antisemitism and the Jewish community – anti-Israel, anti-Zionism, that was almost a secondary issue. We wanted to be on the right side, supporting the community here,” he said. Cummings said Starmer had been delighted to see them join to observe London activists hoping to take Barnet council, where Labour underperformed in 2018 compared to their overall results in London. Jewish Labour activists had described encountering significant anger on the doorsteps in Barnet in 2018. Party sources hope any gains will be a major story of next week’s election results to show how the party is changing. Starmer has repeatedly said he intends to rid the party of any antisemitic members, in the wake of the equalities watchdog report, which criticised the handling of complaints. Corbyn has been suspended from the Labour whip for his reaction to that report and Starmer also sacked his shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, for praising an interview which compared Israeli police tactics to the murder of George Floyd. Both decisions have drawn significant criticism from the party’s left. Starmer has also shown an uncompromising attitude towards pro-Palestinian activism since he was elected leader. He said he did not accept the findings of an Amnesty International report that Israel was an apartheid state. Its report found there was “institutionalised and prolonged racist oppression of millions of people”. Michael Rubin, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said the visit was “an important landmark in the rebuilding of the deep and historic relationship with our sister party”.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer hosts Israeli Labor party in charm offensive ahead of local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/keir-starmer-hosts-israeli-labor-party-in-charm-offensive-ahead-of-local-elections
4/29/2022,"NatWest executives have avoided a shareholder rebellion despite a controversial new pay policy that could net its chief executive, Alison Rose, as much as £5.2m a year. The bank’s new pay policy – which was put to a shareholder vote on Thursday afternoon – will increase Rose’s potential bonus payouts by 25%, and result in a 43% rise for finance chief, Katie Murray, by 2023. Rose was paid nearly £3.6m in 2021. Nearly 93% of shareholder votes were cast in favour of the policy, meaning executives avoided an embarrassing rebellion on the first executive pay overhaul since the bank returned to majority private control last month, when the UK government stake fell below 50% to 48.1%. NatWest – formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group – was nationalised through a £46bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Shareholders backed the policy despite opposition from the influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis, which recommended investors vote against the pay plan. Glass Lewis had concerns over the increase in potential executive pay, as well as the decision to replace long-term incentive plan (LTIP) with a scheme with fewer performance metrics that could make it easier to secure payouts. “We are concerned by the increase in overall incentive opportunity and the introduction of an RSP [restricted share plan] absent of a compelling strategic rationale for this type of award structure,” Glass Lewis said in its report. The RSP will allow Rose to earn as much as 150% of her £1.1m salary, while the new bonus plan will give the banking boss a chance to again double her base pay. Together, the changes will allow Rose to earn 25% more in bonuses than under the current policy, and raise her potential pay prospects by 19%. It means she could earn as much as £5.2m by the time the policy is fully implemented in 2023. NatWest has defended the proposals, saying that while the bank was aware the policy could court controversy, the changes would bring executive pay closer to levels offered by rival UK banks. “We recognise that the move to a more normal construct which involves an increase to total compensation represents a material change and intend to make the transition to the new policy over two years,” NatWest said in its annual report.",News/Business,NatWest avoids revolt as shareholders back executive pay overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/natwest-faces-rebellion-over-executive-pay-overhaul
4/29/2022,"Joe Biden has called for a giant $33bn package of military and economic aid to Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date, in an emphatic rejection of Russian threats of reprisals and escalation. A few hours after Biden spoke, Kyiv was shaken by two powerful cruise missile strikes, while the UN secretary general, António Guterres, was visiting the Ukraine capital following a meeting with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. A senior Ukrainian presidential aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, called the attack a “postcard from Moscow” and asked why Russia still had a seat on the UN security council. Biden asked Congress to give immediate approval for spending that would include over $20bn in military aid, involving everything from heavy artillery and armoured vehicles to greater intelligence sharing, cyber warfare tools and many more anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. Biden also requested $8.5bn in economic aid to Kyiv and $3bn in humanitarian relief, as well as funds to help increase US production of food crops and strategic minerals to offset the impact of the war in Ukraine on global supplies. The total of $33bn is more than twice the last supplemental request approved by Congress in March and dwarfs the entire defence budget of Ukraine and of many other countries. The US president said it was aimed at helping Ukraine repel the renewed Russian offensives in the east and south of the country, but also to transition to assuring the nation’s longer-term security needs. It comes in the face of Russian warnings that increased western weapons supplies to Ukraine would endanger European security, that western intervention could bring instant Russian reprisals and raise the risk of nuclear conflict. Making the case for western aid, Biden argued that on the contrary, if Putin was not stopped in Ukraine he would continue to threaten global peace and stability. The president framed the request principally in terms of defending Ukraine, and did not explicitly repeat the declaration earlier this week by his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, that one of US aims in Ukraine was to weaken Russia to stop it attacking other countries. “Despite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see. We’re not attacking Russia. We’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,” Biden said. But he added the cost involved was “a small price to pay to punish Russia and aggression, to lessen the risk of future conflicts”. “Throughout our history, we’ve learned that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and engage in more aggression,” he said. “The threats to America and the world keep rising. We can’t let this happen.” The new military assistance the congressional funding will finance will include: More artillery and armored vehicles, as well as anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft systems. Help to build up Ukraine’s cyber warfare capabilities. More intelligence sharing. Support to increase Ukraine’s ability to produce munitions and strategic minerals. Assistance in clearing landmines and other explosives and in Ukraine’s defence against chemical, biological and dirty bomb attacks. A further buildup in the US military presence on Nato’s eastern flank. The Kremlin’s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, warned on Thursday that an increased western supply of heavy weapons to Kyiv would endanger European security. “The tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability,” Peskov said. The day before, Vladimir Putin had threatened a “lightning fast” response to western intervention in Ukraine, adding: “We have all the weapons we need for this.” His foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has accused the US and its allies of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine and warned of the rising danger of a nuclear conflict. Biden rejected the accusation he was fighting a proxy war, describing the claim as part of the Kremlin’s domestic propaganda to explain the inability of Russian forces to achieve their goals. “I think it’s more of a reflection, not of the truth, but of their failure,” the president said. He added: “No one should be making idle comments about the use of nuclear weapons.” The package of proposals the administration is sending to Congress also includes measures to strengthen the hand of the justice department in pursuing Kremlin-aligned oligarchs seizing their assets and using the proceeds to support the Ukraine war effort. Biden said the measures would allow for “expanded and expedited measures for investigating, prosecuting, and forfeiting assets of Russian oligarchs to be used for the benefit of Ukraine”. “We’re going to seize their yachts and luxury homes and other ill-begotten gains of Putin’s kleptocracy,” he added. The president made his announcement as the UN secretary general was visiting Ukraine, where he described the war as “an absurdity” in the 21st century. Guterres was touring Borodianka on Thursday, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion on 24 February, before talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In nearby Bucha, where dozens of civilian bodies, some with their hands tied, were discovered this month, Guterres backed an investigation by the International Criminal Court into possible war crimes in Ukraine. “I appeal to the Russian Federation to accept, to cooperate with the ICC,” he said. The humanitarian impact of the Russian invasion has been devastating. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said nearly 5.4 million Ukrainians had fled their country since the attack began, with more than 55,000 leaving in the past 24 hours. While the outflow has slowed significantly since March, it forecast that the conflict in Ukraine could produce 8.3 million refugees by the end of the year. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, warned the west on Thursday to stop encouraging Ukraine to strike at targets inside Russian territory, saying it was “trying our patience”. Multiple targets, including fuel and ammunition depots, have been hit in Russian provinces bordering Ukraine in recent days. “Such aggression against Russia cannot remain without an answer,” Zakharova said. “We would like Kyiv and western capitals to take seriously the statement that further provocation prompting Ukraine to strike against Russian facilities will be met with a harsh response from Russia.” Podolyak, the Ukrainian presidential aide, defended the country’s right to strike inside Russia, saying: “Ukraine will defend itself in any way, including strikes on the warehouses and bases of the killers in Russia. The world recognises this right.” Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday also repeated the UK’s assertion that it was “legitimate under international law” for Ukrainian forces to target Russian logistics infrastructure, but he said such attacks were unlikely to use British weapons. The US on Thursday accused Russia of planning fake independence votes to justify its conquest of Ukrainian territory, saying the Kremlin might attempt “sham referenda” in southern and eastern areas it had captured using “a well-worn playbook that steals from history’s darkest chapters” and must “never be recognised as legitimate”.",News/US news,Biden asks Congress for $33bn Ukraine aid package,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/joe-biden-ukraine-military-aid-us-congress
4/29/2022,"Global heating is causing such a drastic change to the world’s oceans that it risks a mass extinction event of marine species that rivals anything that’s happened in the Earth’s history over tens of millions of years, new research has warned. Accelerating climate change is causing a “profound” impact upon ocean ecosystems that is “driving extinction risk higher and marine biological richness lower than has been seen in Earth’s history for the past tens of millions of years”, according to the study. The world’s seawater is steadily climbing in temperature due to the extra heat produced from the burning of fossil fuels, while oxygen levels in the ocean are plunging and the water is acidifying from the soaking up of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This means the oceans are overheated, increasingly gasping for breath – the volume of ocean waters completely depleted of oxygen has quadrupled since the 1960s – and becoming more hostile to life. Aquatic creatures such as clams, mussels and shrimp are unable to properly form shells due to the acidification of seawater. All of this means the planet could slip into a “mass extinction rivaling those in Earth’s past”, states the new research, published in Science. The pressures of rising heat and loss of oxygen are, researchers said, uncomfortably reminiscent of the mass extinction event that occurred at the end of the Permian period about 250m years ago. This cataclysm, known as the “great dying”, led to the demise of up to 96% of the planet’s marine animals. “Even if the magnitude of species loss is not the same level as this, the mechanism of the species loss would be the same,” said Justin Penn, a climate scientist at Princeton University who co-authored the new research. “The future of life in the oceans rests strongly on what we decide to do with greenhouse gases today. There are two vastly different oceans we could be seeing, one devoid of a lot of life we see today, depending on what we see with CO2 emissions moving forward.” Truly catastrophic extinction levels may be reached should the world emit planet-heating gases in an unrestrained way, leading to more than 4C of average warming above pre-industrial times by the end of this century, the research found. This would trigger extinctions that would reshape ocean life for several more centuries as temperatures continue to climb. But even in the better case scenarios, the world is still set to lose a significant chunk of its marine life. At 2C of heating above the pre-industrial norm, which is forecast as likely even under current climate pledges by the world’s governments, around 4% of the roughly two million species in the oceans will be wiped out. Fish and marine mammals that live in polar regions are most vulnerable, according to the study, as they will be unable to migrate to suitably cooler climes, unlike tropical species. “They will just have nowhere to go,” said Penn. The threat of climate change is amplifying the other major dangers faced by aquatic life, such as over-fishing and pollution. Between 10% and 15% of marine species are already at risk of extinction because of these various threats, the study found, drawing upon International Union for Conservation of Nature data. John Bruno, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said the new research appeared “sound” but it differed from previous studies on the topic that suggest species will mainly disperse to new areas rather than be completely snuffed out. “It’s very different from what most prior work has developed. But that doesn’t mean they are wrong,” Bruno said. “I think this new work is challenging some of our current assumptions about the geographic patterns of looming extinction in the ocean.” Bruno said that while mass extinctions are likely from extreme heating in the future, the current impacts from climate change and other threats should be concerning enough for policymakers and the public. “Personally, I’m a lot more worried about the ecosystem degradation we’re already seeing after less than 1C of warming,” he said. “We don’t need to look to a world so warmed over humanity has been wiped out – we’re already losing untold biodiversity and ecosystem functioning with even the relatively modest warming of the last 50 years.”",News/Environment,Global warming risks most cataclysmic extinction of marine life in 250m years,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/global-warming-risks-cataclysmic-mass-extinction-marine-life
4/29/2022,"From sociable labradors to aggressive pitbulls, when it comes to canine behaviour there are no end of stereotypes. But research suggests such traits may have less to do with breed than previously thought. Modern dog breeds began to emerge in the Victorian era and are often physically distinct – for example, great danes are huge and chihuahuas tiny. But it has often been thought breed can predict behaviour, too. Now researchers say there’s little sign that’s the case. Dr Elinor Karlsson of the University of Massachusetts Umass Chan medical school, a co-author of the study, said research revealed a huge diversity of behaviours within each breed. “Even if the average is different, you’ve still got a really good chance of getting a dog that doesn’t match what people say that breed is supposed to be,” she said. Writing in the journal Science, the US researchers report how they analysed survey responses relating to the physical traits and behaviour of 18,385 pet dogs, almost half of which were purebred, with genetic data analysed for 2,155 of them. Analysis of the survey results for purebred dogs suggested about 9% of behavioural variation was explained by breed. “For the most part, we didn’t see strong differences in breeds, but there are some [behaviours] that are connected to breed more than others,” said Karlsson. While no behaviour was exclusive to one breed, howling was more common among beagles, while pitbulls and retrievers were more “human sociable”, or comfortable with strangers. There were also some differences based on dogs’ ancestral functions. For example, herding breeds were, among other traits, more biddable. But there was a high degree of variability between individuals, meaning it is difficult to predict a dog’s behaviour based on its breed. To explore whether genetics explained the associations, the team analysed the behaviour of mutts that had different levels of ancestry from particular breeds. The results reveal some traits have a stronger genetic component than others. Labrador retriever ancestry was associated with mutts who had few qualms about getting wet, yet such ancestry appeared to have no link to human sociability. “We’d expect that if Labrador retrievers are genetically more human social, we should see that mutts with more Labrador retriever ancestry to be more human social,” said Karlsson. While the team’s other analyses found human sociability is highly heritable, Karlsson noted the mutt results suggest the genetic variants involved do not appear to be more common in particular breeds. Instead, differences between breeds for this trait may be down to environmental influences, or even owners’ perceptions. But not all behaviours were found to be heritable, including how easily a dog is provoked by a frightening trigger – a finding that suggests that how aggressive a dog is may have little to do with genetics. The team says the study has implications for owners. “They should pay much less attention to all the stories about what their dog’s breed ancestry says about their behaviour and personality, and pay attention to the dog sitting in front of them,” said Karlsson. Daniel Mills, professor of veterinary behavioural medicine at the University of Lincoln, who was not involved in the work, said genetics can give insights into populations but often reveal far less about individuals. Mills added that it was not surprising genetics played little role in canine aggression, and criticised breed-specific legislation. “Potentially risky behaviours … are unlikely to be controlled by simple genetic mechanisms since animals have to make judgment calls based on the much wider environment and their developmental history,” he said. The findings came as another study, published in Scientific Reports, revealed that different breeds have strikingly different life expectancies. The analysis of 30,563 records of dog deaths in the UK, collected between 2016 and 2020, showed that while jack russell terriers have a life expectancy of 12.72 years at birth, flat-faced breeds tended to have shorter lives, with French bulldogs having a life expectancy at birth of just 4.53 years. Such brachycephalic dogs are known to be prone to myriad health problems as a result of their extreme physical traits. Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the findings of lower life expectancy for flat-faced breeds was concerning: “While the study doesn’t prove a direct link between these breeds’ potential welfare issues and shorter length of life, the findings serve as a fresh reminder for prospective dog owners to choose a breed based on health, not looks.”",News/Science,"Dog behaviour has little to do with breed, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/dog-behaviour-has-little-to-do-with-breed-study-finds
4/29/2022,"First-home buyers have been warned to plan carefully before taking advantage of a federal government scheme that would allow them to secure property with a 5% deposit, at a time interest rates are predicted to rise. Experts say the First Home Guarantee scheme could be appropriate for people who plan to stay in one spot for a while and are comfortable riding out a possible property value trough, but warn it could still be risky, especially in regional areas. Rising cost of living and flat wages growth should also be considerations for anyone considering the scheme, which was expanded in the federal budget to include a further 50,000 places a year and higher price caps. At the time, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said entering the market was getting harder and that raising the caps would make it easier for more people to secure a loan. “These higher price caps will help more people realise their dreams and lock in a stronger future for themselves,” he said. The scheme – which has already been used by 60,000 Australians – aims to help people get into the housing market quicker by allowing mostly first-home buyers to snag a property with a deposit of as little as 5% of its market value. But research director at financial comparison service RateCity, Sally Tindall, said the predicted cooling of the housing market and multiple RBA rate hikes could lead to problems. “If you factor that into an equation with a first-time buyer who buys at the peak with a wafer-thin deposit, that could spell danger if they can’t keep up with their mortgage repayments,” she said. “Just because the government is putting it forward as a solution to Australia’s housing affordability crisis, that doesn’t necessarily make it a good idea for you.” While she and other experts said the banks’ assessment processes before a loan is approved through the scheme should protect some people, they could not protect against every eventuality. “Life can often throw curveballs that you can’t factor into an equation like this,” Tindall said. “If first-time buyers don’t have a decent buffer to fall back on, they could end up having to have a tough conversation with their bank.” She also said that buying in a regional area could be risky if the great country relocation slowed and the property lost value, and that it might not regain as quickly as a place in the city. The scheme’s cap has been raised from July to $900,000 for Sydney and larger regional cities across the state, including Wollongong and Newcastle. The cap for the rest of New South Wales has gone from $600,000 to $750,000. The limits are similar in Melbourne and larger Victorian cities at $800,000, and $650,000 for the rest of the state, increases of $100,000 and $150,000 respectively. The founder of data analytics firm SQM Research, Louis Christopher, said the combination of the scheme and current economic factors could see people go into negative equity very quickly. “It would severely limit your lifestyle … and it also locks you in until you’re out of negative equity because if you sell your property, you still owe the bank money,” Christopher said. “There is a reason why the banking sector and us experts strongly recommend putting down greater deposits … so one can withstand a downturn early on in your homeownership.” He said most city properties would probably recover from a minor slump but “it’s quite possible you could have a downturn that lasts for years”, and that the regional market was historically far more volatile. But not all experts were as pessimistic about the regions. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney, Prof Tim Harcourt, said regional Australia was in a better position now than it was a few decades ago. “We’ve seen this great relocation during the pandemic and some of the regional growth has been quite successful,” Harcourt said. “For regional cities, the prospects are quite bullish. For very, very small country towns, sure, don’t hold on. But for places like Orange and Ballarat, the prospects are pretty nice.” Economic policy program director at the Grattan Institute, Brendan Coates, said anyone with major loans needed to be paying attention to what was going on. “The warning for everyone who’s taken out a loan – particularly for people that are highly leveraged – is that high interest rates are coming and they’re coming soon,” Coates said. “For people that either have taken out a loan or are looking to take out a loan, [they] should be budgeting on the basis that interest rates are going to be substantially higher than they are today.”",News/Australia news,Buyers warned about rushing into government’s First Home Guarantee scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/buyers-warned-about-rushing-into-governments-first-home-guarantee-scheme

Over the past five years or so her responsibilities have grown and her staff team has shrunk to a point where it is clearly impossible for her to do the work required. She works ridiculous hours in an attempt to achieve the impossible – which she can’t, which makes her miserable, stressed and bad-tempered. I love her deeply and I hate to see her so unhappy, but life with someone who alternates between snappy and tearful is awful, and her absolute refusal to do anything – flag the situation she’s in, see a doctor, anything – to improve things is deeply frustrating. I did manage to persuade her to join the union but she will not ask them for any sort of help. Home life is intolerable for me and must be much worse for her. Should I do anything? What can I do? Eleanor says: Sometimes when your partner goes through a trying period, your job is to help as much as possible – including by being forgiving. Other times the fact that things are “just busy right now” is no longer something that’s foisted on them – it’s a situation they’ve chosen to remain in. Past that point, the fact that the birthday party got missed or the plans got changed last-minute stops being something we can talk about in the passive voice. Their busy-ness stops being something that’s happening to them – it starts being something they’re doing. The trouble is it’s very hard to figure out where that point is. It’s going to be different for different families; informed by what you’ve agreed on, your finances, who does the domestic work, how well expectations are managed, and what viable alternatives there are. But even though everyone has a different point of busy-toleration, you need to be able to tell your partner when you’ve gone past yours. It sounds like you’re well past yours. I’d start by making absolutely sure you’ve communicated that. Although your letter suggests you’ve talked about this together, you’d be surprised by how wide a knowledge asymmetry can sneak into a marriage. What you experience as an ever-present problem – the thing you bring up repeatedly, your highest priority for fixing – she may experience very differently. If someone asked her today how happy you are at home, what would she say? If you’re anything less than confident that she’d name the same problems you have written here, I’d start with a clear and careful conversation to fix that. These chats can be tricky, but you’re not accusing her of ruining your home life – your letter brims with regard and genuine concern. All you need to communicate is that concern plus one additional insight: there’s no reason to suppose work will get better by itself. Second, I’m curious what shape her “refusal to do anything” takes. Where you invest your energy depends on which one of these scenarios she is in. Is it that overwork has eroded her mental health? Terrible workplaces make casualties of our self-esteem and imagination, two things we need lots of to chase a better future. Or is it a point of pride to work so hard; is she proving something to a colleague, or to herself? Is there a feature of the rest of life that working so hard allows her to evade? Working with her to discover why she doesn’t want help may make it feel less invasive to try to supply it. Try not to lead with how this affects you – start with how it impacts her and the “we” of your collective life. That way you’re on her side. Meantime, it might help to start small – suggesting a phoneless walk in the morning together, or a dedicated hour once a week with no work-chat allowed; some time set aside on the weekend to take turns doing nice things for one another. Change, for anyone, comes when we see how hard things are now and realise they won’t change on their own.

4/29/2022,"Wholesale power prices in Australia’s main electricity market continued to rise in the first three months of 2022, more than doubling the cost a year earlier, with the increase blamed mostly on more costly fossil fuels and the falling reliability of coal-fired power plants. Renewable energy, meanwhile, grew its share of the market to more than one-third, pushing carbon emissions from the largest polluting sector to new lows, according to the quarterly energy dynamics report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). Wholesale electricity prices averaged $87 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the first three months of 2022, up 141% from a year earlier, and two-thirds higher than the final three months of 2021. By the end of the March quarter, the average price in the four eastern mainland states was $94/MWh, up from an average of $65/MWh at the end of 2021. On Thursday, future prices for this quarter topped $200/MWh for both Queensland and New South Wales, indicating the jolt in costs is continuing. For the March quarter, generation at black coal plants in NSW and Queensland fell an average 456MW. Availability was off 3% to its lowest March quarter level since at least 2002. The unavailability of those ailing units – along with higher demand particularly during heatwaves in Queensland – triggered a divide with those states facing “significantly” higher prices than Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, Aemo said. “Coinciding with unplanned coal generation outages, Queensland experienced significant episodes of high demand, with overall price volatility contributing $47/MWh of the region’s average Q1 price of $150/MWh, its second highest for any quarter since 1998,” said Violette Mouchaileh, an Aemo executive. The leap in wholesale power prices is beginning to feed into the bills sent to households and businesses. Extra costs will also stoke the highest consumer price inflation since the introduction of the GST more than 20 years ago. The higher power prices may also feature in the federal election campaign, with Coalition leaders such as the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, repeating claims on Thursday that the government had lowered power prices while they had risen under previous Labor governments. “The government is delivering on its commitment to secure affordable and reliable energy supply and has achieved its goal of wholesale electricity prices under $70/MWh,” the government stated in its budget just last month. However, Aemo said wholesale prices were already averaging almost a quarter more than that budget figure, with market bids by coal plants leading the increase as costs for the fuel rose. “Compared to the first quarter of 2021, over 3,000MW of black coal offers shifted from lower-price bands to above $60/MWh – the largest year-on-year quarterly change since 1998,” Mouchaileh said. The shift had started before the surge in global coal prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she added. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gas prices also soared two-thirds from a year earlier. Prices were at near-record levels across all Aemo markets, averaging $9.93 per gigajoule, compared with an average $6.05/GJ in the March quarter of 2021. Record gas prices were set in Victoria, Brisbane and Adelaide, while Sydney posted its second-highest March quarter level. Renewable energy sources continued to grab a bigger share of the market, with both capacity and output increasing. Wind and grid-scale solar output increased 743MW to a quarterly record of 4,190MW. Small-scale solar, mostly on rooftops, added another 460MW of capacity. Total renewable share reached 33.7% of supply. With the near-zero cost of fuel for wind, solar and hydro, the expansion of those sources left 6.6% of all dispatch intervals across the national electricity market at negative or zero spot prices. While a record, it was smaller than the share of such pricing in the December half of 2021. “Southern states continued to see higher incidences [of zero or negative prices] at 16.4% for South Australia and 12.5% for Victoria, compared to only around 1% across the northern states,” the report said.

The March quarter jump in wholesale prices may have a way to run. Aemo said outlooks were influenced by the closure timing of plants in NSW and the delayed return of major units on outage including Callide C4 and Swanbank E in Queensland. Higher fuel costs were also expected, particularly in NSW where elevated prices extend into 2025. Future prices in the state rose $51/MWh in the quarter to $131/MWh, the highest among the states, and exceeding the level hit in Victoria after the Hazelwood brown coal-fired plant shut in 2017. By contrast, Queensland 2023 prices are at $108/MWh, South Australia’s $78/MWh, while Victoria’s were the lowest among the mainland states at $61/MWh.

The opposition dashed the hopes of welfare advocates at the beginning of the campaign after confirming it had no plans to review the unemployment payment, as it had planned to do if elected in 2019. It also explicitly said it would not raise the rate in its first budget. The decision, which puts the opposition on a unity ticket with the Coalition on income support rates, came despite Labor seeking to make cost-of-living pressures a key plank of its election campaign, and amid rising costs linked to record inflation figures. Earlier this month the shadow assistant minister for the Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the party had no plans to review the payment, pointing to the Coalition’s decision to lift the base rate by $50-a-fortnight last year. But two of the party’s candidates in crucial marginal seats in New South Wales and South Australia have publicly called for further increases to the payment following that decision, pointing to the large gap between the payment and the poverty line. In a speech to the National Press Club last year Andrew Charlton, Anthony Albanese’s handpicked candidate to run in the western Sydney seat of Parramatta, said lifting the jobseeker rate “made good economic sense and was the right thing to do”. Charlton, an economist and former adviser to Kevin Rudd, was speaking after the Coalition ended the $550-a-fortnight coronavirus supplement in favour of a flat $50-a-fortnight increase to the payment. That was a cut to the incomes of those on benefits who had received a higher rate during the pandemic. He said it was “very hard to understand” why increasing the payment wasn’t “a big priority”. During the pandemic Charlton’s consultancy firm, Accenture, conducted analysis of the coronavirus supplement payment which found that most of the increased payment was used to pay bills, buy household goods such as groceries, and pay down debt. He told the press club the analysis showed the payment had been “life-changing” for recipients, lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. “The pandemic helped us answer the age-old question about the generosity of social payments; it taught us that giving more money to lower income people has many positive benefits both to them and to the community,” he said. “I hope that we get to the situation where we can recognise that lesson of the pandemic, take some of that data and use it to inform better, more generous and ultimately more effective welfare policies going forward.” Louise Miller-Frost, a prominent South Australian social service advocate and Labor’s candidate in the marginal Adelaide seat of Boothby, went even further, saying the jobseeker rate set by the Coalition represented “intentional cruelty against the most vulnerable, least advantaged in our community” and suggested Australia was “no longer the lucky country”. The base rate was then about $44 a day, but with recent indexation it is now $46 a day, or $642.70 a fortnight for a single person without children. “The government has made an informed and deliberate decision to put over 1 million Australian families and individuals into poverty,” the then chief executive of Vinnies SA said in a Facebook post in February 2021. “They have decided it is OK for children to go without regular meals. It is OK with the government for Australians – those they are elected to serve – to not be able to afford to pay their electricity bill, or buy the medications they need, to be at risk of homelessness, or indeed to be on the streets. Because that is what this decision means. “This guarantees that nearly 1 million adults – and their children and other dependents – will remain in poverty.” Asked if she stood by the comments, Miller-Frost told Guardian Australia she wanted to “see an increase to jobseeker”. “It is a view I have formed through my work as Chair of Anti-Poverty Week and Adelaide Zero Homelessness Project, as CEO of Vinnie’s and Catherine House,” she said. But echoing comments from the party’s frontbench, she added: “Labor won’t be able to undo nine years of damage caused by the Liberals in one budget.” Privately, the opposition’s move on jobseeker has been met with dismay among some Labor figures, while Lisa Chesters, the MP for Bendigo, has said publicly that she disagreed with the new position. Asked in the first week of the campaign if he could live on the jobseeker rate of $46 a day, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said he knew what it was like to “live on a fixed income” given his mother was on the disability pension. “What we’ve said is we don’t have a plan to increase the jobseeker allowance in our first budget,” Albanese said. “But what you would do, and I’ve said this on a number of occasions consistently that I’ve been asked, every time governments do a budget, they should look at what is responsible and do what they can to help those in need.” But Albanese also warned that if elected, Labor would face significant government debt. Other Labor MPs who savaged the current jobseeker rate last year include Canberra MP Alicia Payne and Wills MP Peter Khalil, who said in March last year the $3.57-a-day increase to benefits was “not even enough to even buy [two] florets of broccoli from Woolies”. The Greens have pledged to increase all welfare payments to $88 a day, at a cost of $43.7bn in the first year, in what it calls a guaranteed livable income. “Teal” independent hopefuls Zoe Daniel and Kylea Tink, as well as independent incumbents Zali Steggall, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie have also backed an increase to welfare payments.

4/29/2022,"A group of construction unions are set to announce a green ban as part of efforts to protect the historic John Curtin Hotel in Melbourne from redevelopment. The 150-year-old venue, named after wartime Labor prime minister, John Curtin, was recently bought by an overseas-based investor and developer. Opposite Victoria’s Trades Hall in Carlton, the Curtin has long been a popular meeting place for labour movement members and union figures, including former prime minister Bob Hawke. Following Hawke’s death in 2019, the hotel hosted an unofficial wake that was attended by hundreds, including then-opposition leader Bill Shorten, the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, and former premier Steve Bracks. More recently, it has cemented its legacy as one of Melbourne’s best live music venues, acting as an important stepping-stone for emerging local and international talent. Prior to its sale, the City of Melbourne granted the Curtin interim “significant” heritage listing, meaning the heritage value of the hotel be considered in any proposed redevelopment of the site. A seperate application for permanent protection, jointly made by Victoria’s National Trust and Trades Hall in March, is being assessed by Heritage Victoria. The Building Industry Group of unions, which represents electricians, plumbers, construction and metalworkers, is also stepping up to protect the Curtin, and will announce a green ban to prevent its demolition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The term was coined in the early 1970s by Jack Mundey of the Builders Labourers Federation, which fought successful campaigns to protect parkland, low-income housing and buildings with historical significance in Melbourne and Sydney. The chief executive of the state branch of the National Trust, Simon Ambrose, credits green bans with saving Melbourne’s Queen Victoria Market, Regent Theatre and Flinders Street Station from development. “The National Trust is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the union movement to protect the Curtin, another beloved cultural institution,” he said. “The Curtin has been a community meeting place for more than 160 years. Our goal is to ensure that it remains a pub and live music venue, and doesn’t become a facade with a block of apartments behind it.” Victorian Trades Hall secretary, Luke Hilakari, said the union movement has a “long and proud history of protecting important cultural sites and buildings in Melbourne”. “This is about saving an important gathering place for the future, but it’s also about preserving our city’s heritage,” he said. He said the union wanted to avoid a repeat of the illegal demolition of Carlton’s Corkman Hotel in 2016, which resulted in its developers being fined nearly $1m and jailed after failing to turn the site into a public park. “This green ban sends a clear message from Victorian workers: we will not stand by and let our precious, historic building be destroyed.” City of Melbourne deputy lord mayor, Nicholas Reece, said heritage pubs had irreplaceable social and cultural value. “The City of Melbourne has endorsed interim ‘significant’ heritage protection for The Curtin Hotel, to help ensure it receives the strongest possible level of protection in any redevelopment application,” he said. “Any redevelopment proposal will be considered extremely carefully by councillors.”",News/Australia news,Unions to announce green ban in bid to protect Melbourne’s John Curtin hotel,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/unions-to-announce-green-ban-in-bid-to-protect-melbournes-john-curtin-hotel
4/29/2022,"The prospect of the Reserve Bank of Australia raising interest rates in May has prompted a spike in queries about fixed loans from borrowers and reinforced expectations that property prices will fall, including in Melbourne and Sydney where they may already have peaked. Traders have priced in a lift in the RBA’s cash rate to 0.25% at its 3 May meeting after Wednesday’s March quarter inflation data was much higher than forecast. Most banks, with the exception of the Commonwealth Bank, say the central bank has no choice but to raise the rate from a record-low 0.1% after consumer prices rose the most in more than 20 years. Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity.com.au, said her firm on Thursday had received “lots of inquiries about fixing and whether now’s a good time to fix on the back of [the] CPI figures”. According to the Australian bureau of statistics, the share of loans taken out with a fixed rate peaked last July at 46% and had shrunk to just above one in four by February. Tindall said it was too early to tell whether any short-term jump in fixings would last. Tindall said the big four banks were still offering variable rate loans averaging 2.14% compared with three-year fixed loans of more than 4%. “If you’re someone that’s going to stay up late all night worrying about what the RBA might or might not do, then fixing can buy you peace of mind,” she said. On the other hand, those able to make significant extra payments or who might be thinking of selling or refinancing, “might be better off on a variable rate”. Gareth Aird, a senior CBA economist, said markets typically lead the central bank in a tightening cycle, as has happened this time. Banks had been raising fixed rates since October. One factor was the end of the RBA’s term funding facility in June. It was set up to ease Covid impacts on the economy and that allowed banks to borrow at a 0.1% rate for as long as three years. “That underpinned these incredibly low, fixed rates,” Aird said. “The market is [also] pricing in significant RBA tightening, and therefore fixed rates have risen to reflect that.” For instance the National Australia Bank, the country’s third-largest home loan lender, raised fixed rates last week for the fourth time in 2022, including lifting the rate on a standard five-year loan by half a percentage point to 4.99%. Some loans, such as those for four years, have increased almost 3 percentage points in less than a year, RateCity said. Borrowers, meanwhile, had already returned to fixing loans with shorter maturations, CBA data shows. From CBA last month, showing that borrowers if fixing are doing so very much for shorter durations. May see that change a bit after the CPI spike. pic.twitter.com/IyBqEMWCZL RateCity’s Tindall said competition between lenders meant variable loans can still be obtained at sub-2% annual rates. “There are 32 lenders on our database that have at least one variable rate for owner occupiers under 2%,” she said. “They’re entitled to refinance to someone offering them a better deal and there are still some cracking variable rates out there.” Analysis by CoreLogic showed higher rates will have a varying impact across the country depending on the size of the loan. Sydney, with the most expensive median prices at more than $1.1m, would see the biggest increase in repayments. Tim Lawless, CoreLogic’s research director, said the central bank was not yet worried about the ability of most mortgage holders to absorb the repayment pain. “The RBA has recently noted in their latest financial stability review the median repayment buffer for owner occupiers with a variable mortgage rate had grown to 21 months of scheduled repayments in February 2022, up from 10 months at the start of the pandemic,” Lawless said in a report released on Thursday. “With a two-percentage point rise in interest rates, the median repayment buffer would reduce back to 19 months, which is still substantial. “With the median household well ahead of their mortgage repayments, the risk of households falling behind on their mortgage repayments is reduced.” Those on fixed rates would be insulated from the immediate rise, but face “a refinance shock” when their loan period expires, Lawless said. CoreLogic, RateCity, and CBA’s Aird all predict house prices, if they haven’t already peaked, will start to decline as interest rates rise. The RBA has said as much too, forecasting recently that a 2 percentage point rise in rates would lop an estimated 15% off real housing prices. “A larger fall of 20% could take national housing values back to similar levels as June 2017, while a smaller 10% drop would see values at levels similar to June 2021 and a 5% drop back to September 2021 levels,” CoreLogic’s Lawless said. He said in markets where housing values have been rising faster, such as Brisbane and Adelaide, a 15% decline would take housing values back to mid-2021 levels. “While in Melbourne, a 15% drop could see values at a similar level as May 2017, or in the case of Perth, back to June 2009 levels.” Aird said the extent to which house prices fall would be “heavily dictated by how quickly and how high the RBA takes the cash rate higher”. “They’ll probably end the year around about flat given they’ve been going up in the first part of the year,” he said. “Next year, we’re looking for national home prices to end the year down around 8%.”",News/Business,Interest rates are set to start rising.

4/29/2022,"Australia’s defence minister, Peter Dutton, said on Anzac Day: “The only way you can preserve peace is to prepare for war and be strong as a country, not to cower, not to be on bended knee and be weak.” But how does this rhetoric about preparing for war match reality? We take a look at five significant defence projects that are either well behind schedule or have had major problems. This is the most high-profile defence acquisition debacle. In the process, two close partners of Australia – Japan and France – have been burnt. Tony Abbott formed a close working relationship with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and was known to be keen on Japan building Australia’s future submarine fleet. In February 2015, however, the then prime minister fought off a leadership spill motion in part by promising a “competitive evaluation process” to shore up support from South Australian colleagues worried about shipbuilding jobs in that state. Abbott’s defence minister, Kevin Andrews, said in 2015 it would be an investment “in the order of $50bn” and the next submarine “must be delivered in time to avoid a capability gap in the mid-2020s when the Collins Class submarine is scheduled to be retired from service”. In 2016, Abbott’s successor Malcolm Turnbull announced France’s DCNS – now named Naval Group – had been selected instead of Japan or Germany “as our preferred international partner for the design of the 12 Future Submarines, subject to further discussions on commercial matters”. It took years to finalise the overarching strategic agreement, and the auditor general found the Australian government had “increased the risk of this acquisition” by going for a tailored solution rather than buying submarines “off the shelf”. Fast forward to September 2021, when Scott Morrison pulled the pin on the $89bn French conventional submarines project in favour of the Aukus deal, under which Australia now seeks at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines at unspecified cost. As it stands there is no contract – the details are subject to a joint study that runs until early next year. Morrison initially said the first of the new submarines should be in the water by 2040 but Dutton has since implied the mid-2030s might be possible. This has all raised concerns about a capability gap before the new submarines are ready. The government is already planning to extend the life of the six Collins class submarines by 10 years, with extensive refitting set to cost between $3.5bn and $6bn. Labor supports Aukus but says it would consider interim options such as fitting Tomahawk missiles to the existing Collins class submarines. The government is facing growing scrutiny about its $45bn future frigates program. The Coalition wants nine Hunter class frigates, optimised for anti-submarine warfare, to replace the current Anzac class frigates. They are meant to provide the Royal Australian Navy with “the critical capability required to defend Australia well into the future”. But the project is still in the early design stage and there are concerns about risks linked to the increased weight of the Hunter class frigate. A major projects report notes the plans have “experienced schedule variance due to delays in the United Kingdom’s Type 26 program, which is the Reference Ship Design for the Hunter Class frigate”. In February, the Australian newspaper reported the Hunter class frigates could be “substantially” slower than comparable RAN surface combatants, have a shorter range than originally intended, and be vulnerable to detection by enemy vessels, based on a Defence engineering team assessment. Dutton said his department had assured him it could mitigate the risks. “Yes, concerns are raised, but they are being addressed,” he told Sky News. The defence minister said the government decided last year “we would push back the start of this [first] ship by about 18 months and the reason we did that was because of the lack of maturity around the design”. Officials say the first ship is expected to be delivered in 2031 and the final one in 2044. Ships are usually operational one to two years after delivery. A much-trumpeted $1.1bn upgrade to the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (Jorn) is running “several years” behind schedule. That is despite the announcement by the Morrison government in 2020 that it was expanding the Jorn site at Longreach in Queensland “to provide wide area surveillance of Australia’s eastern approaches and enhance Australia’s strategic situational awareness”. Jorn supports the Australian defence force’s air and maritime operations while also providing “strategic surveillance”. The upgrade includes plans to modernise the command and control system at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Edinburgh in South Australia and three radar sites at Longreach, Laverton in Western Australia and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. According to the latest major projects report published by the Australian National Audit Office, the upgrade project has “experienced persistent lag” in delivering the systems engineering program, mainly due to underestimating how complex it would be. Those delays are “considered unrecoverable”. The upgrade was meant to be completed by January 2029 but the dates of all of the key milestones are now listed as “to be advised”. “The delays are anticipated to be several years,” the report said. This is a near-term capability that Australia won’t have for budget reasons. Officials revealed in a Senate committee hearing earlier this month the government had quietly scrapped the $1.3bn armed drones program to partly offset the cost of a cybersecurity package dubbed Redspice. Under the now-cancelled SkyGuardian program, which the Department of Defence said provided “an excellent capability system”, Australia planned to acquire up to 12 armed drones. The then defence minister Linda Reynolds hailed the merits of the project in 2019: “Cutting-edge technology of this kind, with advanced sensors and systems, would complement advanced aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and ensure that Australian defence force maintains state-of-the-art capability.” Vice Admiral David Johnston, the vice chief of the ADF, confirmed the axing of the project means “we do not have drones that are armed”, although he argued that type of capability “can be mostly replicated through other means”. The executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Peter Jennings, condemned the “mind-bogglingly stupid” decision because it was “a rare Defence project that was going to deliver new combat capability in just a few years”. Labor has will consider reinstating the program if elected. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, told Guardian Australia he was concerned about a “very significant capability gap in the immediate future” and noted Ukraine was seeking armed drones. The acquisition of MRH90 Taipan helicopters can be put in the “long-troubled” box. Australia bought 47 Taipans as a replacement for the Black Hawk and Sea King helicopter fleets, but the multibillion-dollar Howard government-era acquisition has been listed as a “project of concern” since 2011. The helicopters are used by the army – including to provide support to special operations – while the navy also relies on them for maritime support. The entire fleet was grounded in 2019 amid serious concerns about the tail rotor blades and 27 aircraft were grounded in 2020 to fix cabin sliding door rails. In October 2020, Defence officials conceded the door was not wide enough to enable the safe exit of personnel from the helicopter while it was firing. The Australian government has now formally requested advice from the US on the acquisition of up to 40 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for the Australian army “as an alternative platform to the MRH90 Taipan”. Essentially this signals the likely withdrawal from service of the Taipan helicopters well before the original 2037 date. In announcing the change of course in December, Dutton said the Taipans had been found to be “unreliable” and he hoped the new ones would be in service “over the next couple of years”. The new helicopters would not be built or designed in Australia, he said, because it was important to “achieve capability sooner than later”. The defence department has previously estimated the total cost of the MRH90 Taipan program would be $15bn by the time the helicopters were due to be withdrawn from service in 2037, including $3.7bn for the purchase and $11.3bn to sustain them. In a way, the helicopter plans have come full circle, now the government is pursuing Black Hawks again. The Australian National Audit Office previously found “significant implications” from the Howard government’s decision in 2004 to approve the acquisition of the MRH90 aircraft, instead of the initial defence department recommendation for Black Hawks.

4/29/2022,"Once a month Paul sends his family out of the house. With a mask on and vinegar solution in hand, he gets to work scrubbing the mould off the roof and walls of his home. It’s in his bedroom, in the kids’ bedrooms and play room, the lounge room, the kitchen. A few days after the clean, it starts to reappear and Paul spot cleans the growth until it’s time for next month’s deep clean. Mould has been an issue in his Wollongong home since he moved in with his family a year ago. “It just keeps coming back and we’re getting no help from the real estate agent or the landlord.” Reports of mould spreading in homes has soared amid the deluge of rain and flooding across Australia’s east coast. The issue hits renters hardest, with some landlords refusing to do anything about it. “We hear from a lot of reports from tenants who’ve been struggling with mould and report it to their landlords or agents, and they will suggest it’s the tenant’s fault,” said Jemima Mowbray, policy and advocacy manager at the Tenants’ Union of New South Wales. “[The tenants] are told to open a window, or clean the house more often, or do X, Y, and Z when the problem is clearly structural.” Soon after Paul moved into his home, a handyman was sent to deal with the mould, but it didn’t solve the problem. Since then, the only solution offered by the real estate agency has been to open a window. “We’re worried that if we try and push it too hard that they’ll just decide ‘we can’t be bothered dealing with these people’,” he said. “And that would be a big problem because I’m in insecure work. The market’s not great for rentals and there is no chance in hell I’ll be able to buy something.” Mowbray suggested tenants contact the civil and administrative tribunal if their landlord refused to fix the problem, but said reporting it can create a tough choice for renters. “Even though people don’t want to live in a mouldy house, they know it’s unhealthy … sometimes making a fuss about mould has to be balanced up against ‘Well, will I get kicked out for making the fuss?’” Dr Michael Taylor, an expert in building air quality at Flinders University, said the NSW Residential Tenancy Act is broad in its requirement for homes to be fit for habitation. He says this is where tenants get a lot of pushback given there isn’t any specific requirements about mould. At the end of March, the Greens state spokesperson for housing, Jenny Leong, launched a private members bill calling for increased tenant protections in the state. This included landlords of residential properties being required to ensure homes are mould-free and have adequate waterproofing. Six weeks ago, Leong put a call-out on social media asking Sydneysiders to share stories of their mould problems. “I was told by the real estate agent it’s something I need to manage and deal with myself. Fast forward to now and mould covers the ceiling, the window sills, the toilet and whatever else is damp. It is impossible to get rid of myself,” one person commented. “We ran dehumidifiers constantly and scrubbed every weekend, but it came back overnight. My partner lost his sense of smell and taste, I couldn’t sleep, my asthma was off the charts, and they just offered to paint over it,” another said. While the wet weather has exacerbated mould problems for many people, Taylor said the issue won’t go away for everyone even if winter is drier. “Mould growth isn’t always the outcome of too much moisture. There can be underlying conditions that have caused the problem that haven’t been solved.” Taylor said if moisture has gotten inside a wall cavity from a leaking roof, for example, and it’s wet internally, then it could need replacing or the mould will continue to regrow. About 10-15% of the population are sensitive to fungal spores and can experience itching, inflammation, allergies and shortness of breath, Taylor said. He added that people who are healthy and well generally don’t experience severe health problems from mould exposure, but people who are immunocompromised can experience infections. Paul said he and his wife worry about their kids’ health due to their exposure to the mould. They frequently talk about moving out. “We bounce back and forth like this isn’t safe, we can’t stay here … but we can’t afford to pay much more for a place.”",News/Australia news,‘This isn’t safe’: NSW renters fight twin battles against mould and landlords ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/this-isnt-safe-nsw-renters-fight-twin-battles-against-mould-and-landlords
4/29/2022,"The wet weather that has triggered record floods and filled dams across much of eastern Australia looks set to extend well into winter and beyond, global models indicate. While autumn is typically the most difficult period to make season-ahead predictions, conditions favouring increasing cloud formation off north-western Australia look likely, even as rain-inducing weather from the Pacific recedes. According to the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest climate driver update, the dominant La Niña pattern in the Pacific is continuing to break down. In its stead, though, are signs that a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole – a gauge of relative sea-surface temperatures on the west and east of that ocean’s basin – will again take hold. The negative phase increases the odds of above-average winter-spring rainfall for much of Australia. For northern Australia, it also increases the chances of warmer days and nights. “While model outlooks have low accuracy at this time of year and hence some caution should be taken with IOD outlooks beyond May, there is consistency across the forecasts from all international models,” the bureau said. By next month, all five of the major models used by @BOM_au to assess convection conditions in the Indian Ocean point to the negative - or wet for us - phase starting. Damper than usual winter and beyond likely for much of Australia. pic.twitter.com/P8uFqYqi1O “Four of five international climate models surveyed by the bureau indicate the possibility of a negative IOD development in May, with all five reaching negative IOD thresholds by June,” it said. Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist at Weatherzone, said that another negative IOD phase would make it back-to-back events, something unseen in six decades. “It looks like we’ll have two officially declared negative Indian Ocean Dipoles, which hasn’t happened at least in [bureau] records that go back to 1960,” he said. After two La Niñas in two years in the Pacific – a pattern that sees strengthening easterly winds pushing rainfall towards Australia – the landscape “is a bit more primed for flooding” than a year ago. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sydneysiders, are among those who won’t need much convincing of the flood risk. April will end on Saturday with the city’s rain gauge receiving more than 250mm – double the monthly average. The harbour city remains on track for its wettest year in more than a century-and-a-half of records, tracking more than 100mm above the record wet year of 1950, Domensino said. The prolonged wet comes as NSW dams are still at an average of 93% full, including about 110% at one of the biggest, Burrendong. Sydney’s dams too remain at close to 99% capacity, so it won’t take much rain to spill them again. The prospect of a negative IOD also shows up in the bureau’s seasonal outlook. Domensino said the typical north-west cloudbands bring extra rainfall to central Australia and dump most of their moisture on the western side of the Great Divide, partly sparing coastal regions such as around Sydney. Near-term outlook is for a bit of rain in the east (good for western Tasmania). Outlook for winter is for above-average rainfall for pretty much the whole continent. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/BOJcIh3LnR Whether the additional precipitation falls as rain or snow on the alpine regions during winter may hinge on the strength of another of Australia’s climate drivers, the Southern Annular Mode. A negative phase of that Southern Ocean gauge sees the typical west-to-east storm tracks shift farther north, bringing bursts of cold weather to southern Australia. During winter, that set-up usually means more snow in the alps. “The ingredients are there for a good [snow] season but it will just come down to the individual events,” Domensino said. While conditions in the Indian Ocean are tilted more strongly towards a negative IOD, the return of another La Niña event for next summer can’t be ruled out either. A triple of three La Niñas in as many years has happened three times since 1950, according to the bureau. Prediction skill remains low at this time of year. “Most of the seven international climate models surveyed by the bureau anticipate the La Niña will ease in strength over the coming months, with a return to neutral ENSO conditions (neither El Niño nor La Niña) most likely in late autumn or early winter,” the bureau said this week. “By June three models exceed the [La Niña] threshold and by July only one does.” The Pacific patterns have widespread effects, such as worsening drought during La Niña periods in the western regions of North and South America.

4/29/2022,"For the last year I’ve been going to the physio once or twice every week, a by-product of having hips and knees that tend to seize up like elastic bands that have been pulled too tight. What began as a demoralising routine of strength tests and painful needling, has recently felt triumphant: I’m completing increasingly strenuous rehab exercises – successfully completing them. I’m not only in less pain, but I’m stronger than I thought I was. “You’re the dux of rehab,” my best friend Brigid texted when I bragged about graduating to another difficulty level. I was in no position to disagree. A few weeks ago, I had a revelation that had nothing to do with my loosening limbs. One frosty morning I was waiting outside the physio, which was locked. I knocked tentatively but there was no reply. Another woman appeared next to me and I knew by her outfit – functional runners, leggings and a baggy T-shirt, essentially exactly what I was wearing – that she was waiting for the rehab class too. She crinkled her eyes in a way that made me sure she was smiling behind her mask. We both stood shivering in the early sun. “Gosh, I hope they let us in soon!” said the woman. “Same!” I said. We both laughed and shivered some more. After a moment I said, “Should I be bold and knock loudly on the door?” We both laughed again, because women aren’t taught to do anything loudly. We’re especially discouraged from doing anything that insinuates a demand, even if that’s opening a door so we can get to an appointment. “Yes!” she exclaimed. We were comrades now. We were going to dismantle the system together, one closed door at a time. If I actually am friendly, what other stories about myself could be true?I ran to the door, knocked very hard and made a show of running back to where she stood, like I was executing a devilish crime. The woman clapped and I did a small bow. Eventually a bleary-eyed physio came to the door and said “Sorry! Forgot to open it!” and let us in. The woman crinkled her eyes at me again and then went up to the exercise room. As I was walking home from the physio, I thought a lot about the woman. It wasn’t an unusual interaction or even a particularly notable one. It stuck with me because I adore people who are quick to laugh, who deliberately go out of their way to make strangers feel at ease, and who use kindness as a bubble that wraps around everyone who they’re interacting with. She was friendly. Then it struck me. Everything this woman had been doing – the smiling, the laughing, making me feel comfortable when I was doing silly things – I had been doing too. We were mirroring each other’s warmth exactly. Could it be? Was it possible that I was friendly too? We tend to tell ourselves stories about our own personalities – that we’re quick to anger, or gullible, or shy with strangers. It had never occurred to me that I was a friendly person (I have been roasted about this every time I have brought it up with friends since, don’t worry). It just wasn’t one of the stories I tell myself about myself. It’s peculiar that we think that certain elements about ourselves are set in stone, even if there’s no real evidence to suggest that these personality traits are permanent. Maybe these stories that we carry, like heavy trunks full of memories, can become outdated – or maybe they were never really true in the first place. Are you actually a showoff? Or did you just perform a particularly emotional rendition of Drops of Jupiter one Christmas when you were 10 and your dad made a snarky comment about it? Are you really moody? Or were you moody as a 15-year-old who was perpetually broken-hearted and unable to articulate how you felt? Are you really quiet? Or were you just reluctant to speak up in that one workplace, because you were terrified of the consequences? When we carry these trunks, can they be so stuffed with preconceived truths that we assume no new or contradictory stories can fit in there too? I had assumed I was always awkward and small talk-averse, and the story was so convincing that it had overridden any other possibility. If I actually am friendly, what other stories about myself could be true? Is it possible that I can also be brave? That I’m not inherently bad at giving directions? That I would actually be a calm and considered driver? (I’m not totally sure about that, but you never know.) It’s interesting to consider. I haven’t seen the woman since, but I do think about her when I’m doing my rehab classes, pushing myself a bit harder than I thought I could go a year ago. I hope she’s feeling good about her progress too. Who knows what we’ll be capable of next year?

4/29/2022,"There is a moment early in the first episode of Make or Break, a new series from Apple TV+ about the World Surf League, when Tyler Wright neatly encapsulates the tension at the heart of professional surfing. “We come from a sport of, ‘aww we’re hippies’,” says the Australian surfer, a two-time WSL champion. “We’re not. We’re competitive little assholes.” Surfing has long grappled with this bipolar identity; a sport initially beloved by the counter-culture movement that grew popular, some would say too popular, on the back of booming commercial and competitive success. Make or Break, an entertaining seven-part series, is the latest attempt by the surfing elite to capitalise on its popularity. Given the show has already been renewed for a second season – before it even went to air – they will most likely succeed. It seems that no high-performance sport can flourish in the modern era without its own behind-the-scenes show on one or other of the rapidly-multiplying streaming platforms. Drive to Survive, the Netflix hit about Formula One, is perhaps the best example – now into its fourth season, the show has expanded the ranks of motorsport fans, including in the lucrative American market. Even before Drive to Survive, English football teams and US sporting franchises were experimenting with access-all-areas docu-series. The success of these shows has sparked a content gold rush. In recent months, Drive to Survive equivalents have been announced for tennis, golf and the Tour de France. Surfing is already on the wave, with this new series developed by Drive to Survive producers James Gay-Rees and Paul Martin (the former is also known for his sporting classics Senna and Maradona). Make or Break is captivating television. Professional surfing is a director’s dream – the WSL sends a small crew of male and female surfers around the world to compete at idyllic surfing locations. The editors have made liberal use of high-definition competition footage, as surfers charge heavy barrels and pull off gravity-defying aerial manoeuvres against beautiful coastal backdrops. There is eye-candy galore. But the show’s real triumph is its ability to engage surfing fans and non-fans alike with well-told stories. Make or Break gently explains and explores the complexity of professional surfing in a manner that makes it accessible for non-surfers, without alienating long-time WSL watchers. The show is unafraid to explore the gritty reality of life on tour, with heartfelt and revealing interviews. “I’m tired to be on the road – I just want to be home,” admits an emotional Filipe Toledo. Another episode charts the challenges faced by the rookies, who live a precarious existence seeking to consolidate their WSL ranking and bank balance. “It’s only once you get results on the tour that you start earning the bucks,” says one. (Professional surfing is a top-heavy sport – the big stars sign million-dollar endorsement deals, while a few bad results can spell competitive and financial doom for others). Now-retired Australian surfing icon Mick Fanning, presented as some kind of wise owl of the surfing world, adds moments of levity throughout the series. Drive to Survive has been criticised for glossing over Formula One’s shortcomings – its history of sportswashing, gender inequality and significant climate impact. Given Make or Break was produced in partnership with the WSL, it is surprising that the first season engages more fully with some of surfing’s own pitfalls. The first episode is particularly gripping, as the WSL confronts a longstanding inequality that has historically seen the women compete at Maui, while the men surfed at the more consequential and iconic Pipeline. “Surfing is sexist,” says a no-nonsense Wright. But a shark attack at Maui during last season’s event saw the women forced to finish the event at Pipeline, a famously-heavy wave. “It would be a moment in women’s surfing history ... but at the same time, farrkkk it’s Pipe,” laughs Wright while weighing up the switch (she ultimately won the event). Pipeline now permanently hosts both the men’s and women’s competition, a positive development – albeit the sport’s lingering gender inequality remains evident in Make or Break, which focuses disproportionately on the men’s competition across the series. Make or Break may well elevate surfing to new heights. The sport’s inclusion in the Olympics last year was another step towards the mainstream; Wright’s brother, Owen, won bronze for Australia. By humanising the world’s best surfers (the frequent expletives suggest unfiltered footage), and accessibly explaining the sport’s vagaries, Make or Break will attract a wider audience to the WSL, just as Drive to Survive has done for Formula One. From the WSL’s perspective, the partnership will likely prove a shrewd commercial decision. In the new sporting era, content is king. But it does leave a wider question unanswered – at what cost? What does commercial success and greater popular recognition, propelled by a new international TV series released by one of the world’s biggest technology companies, mean for the soul of surfing? Is the sport’s growing mass-appeal an unalloyed positive? Midway through Make or Break, the WSL season heads to inland California, for an event at Kelly Slater’s Surf Ranch, a wave pool. This artificial competition setting is depicted as a pure test of surfing ability. “There’s nowhere to hide,” says one observer of the format, in which surfers compete individually on identical waves, ranked against the whole field, rather than in heat-by-heat contests subject to the whims of the ocean. Left unremarked is the profound philosophical shift prompted by wave pool surfing for a sport and past-time founded on a deep, even spiritual connection to the sea. It may be too much to expect a glossy streaming series to explore such existential questions. The evolution of the sport, from its hippy roots to wave-pool competition broadcast around the globe, continues unabated. Make or Break will only give this trend greater momentum. But, at the very least, it is compelling viewing.

4/29/2022,"A majority of voters agree with key Labor campaign messages that Scott Morrison is “all announcement no delivery” and Labor will “put the care back into aged care”, according to new research. A poll of 1,000 voters, commissioned by the progressive think-tank the Australia Institute, shows Labor’s messages are the most effective of the campaign so far, although Coalition claims about handling of the economy also test well. As the campaign nears the halfway mark, Labor is intent on keeping the pressure on Scott Morrison, but the highest inflation in more than 20 years and the expectation of a campaign interest rate rise is increasing the salience of cost of living pressures. The nationally representative poll has a margin of error of 3% and was conducted after the Easter weekend, after Anthony Albanese’s gaffe on unemployment dominated the first week of the campaign but before Covid-19 forced the opposition leader into one week of isolation. In the poll, 53% of respondents agreed Morrison is “all announcement no delivery”, with just 31% disagreeing (net +22%). That message was potent across the political spectrum, with Labor (72%), Greens (69%), One Nation (50%) and other voters (56%) agreeing. The claim that Morrison is “there for the photo-op not for the follow-up” has been central to Labor’s attack on the prime minister since 2020, and seeks to remind voters about failures to deliver including in the wake of catastrophic bushfires. Perhaps surprisingly in an election dominated by negative messaging, the next most effective message was Labor’s on aged care. Half of respondents (50%) agreed with the claim that Labor will “put the care back into aged care” while 29% disagreed (+21%). However, this was boosted by stratospheric support among Labor voters (81% agreeing). Some 45% of respondents agreed that “cutting Medicare is in the Liberals’ DNA, strengthening and protecting it is in Labor’s” while 31% disagreed (+14%). One Nation voters narrowly disagreed with that proposition; while more “other” voters agreed with it. Key Coalition lines had net support of 8% (44% agreeing and 36% disagreeing): “the Coalition will deliver a stronger economy and a stronger future”; and “the Labor Party do not have an economic plan … and when you don’t understand the economy, and when you can’t run a campaign, that means you can’t run the country”. A similar line claiming “Labor has no plan for Australia’s economy, no plan to create jobs and no plan for cost of living relief for Australians” received less support, with just 42% agreeing and 40% disagreeing. That line resonates with Coalition voters, with 73% agreeing, and One Nation (52%). Claims the Coalition will deliver “a stronger economy and a stronger future” received majority support only from its own voters, with One Nation and other voters narrowly rejecting it. Despite Morrison’s decision to ditch a commitment to an integrity commission and internal division over the candidate for Warringah, the first week was dominated by Albanese’s failure to name the unemployment rate and official cash rate. The gaffe initially hurt Labor’s chances, although the opposition believes its effect is waning, as China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands and soaring inflation create discomfort for the Coalition in areas of their perceived traditional strengths.",News/Australia news,"Labor’s message that Morrison is ‘all announcement no delivery’ resonating with voters, poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/labors-message-that-morrison-is-all-announcement-no-delivery-resonating-with-voters-poll-shows
4/29/2022,"This June, it will be 30 years since John Major launched one of the most mocked ideas in British political history. Proposed by a man thrashing around in the economic doldrums, the traffic cones hotline was just a phone number for angry motorists to ring up and moan about roadworks. Yet something about its spectacular banality means it has passed into Westminster shorthand. Every failing government now seemingly has its cones hotline moment, where it suddenly becomes obvious that the ideas cupboard is worryingly bare. And this week’s cabinet meeting on the cost of living sounds as if it was positively bursting with such moments. Boris Johnson had reportedly asked for proposals to tackle the cost of living emergency without spending any actual public money, a question that inevitably raises some questions of its own. He is apparently interested in an old Liz Truss proposal for cutting childcare costs by allowing childminders to look after more than six children at once. Ministers have reportedly joked that if Jacob Rees-Mogg can look after his six simultaneously, surely childminders can go one better, while simultaneously delivering a high-quality early-years learning experience and having eyes in the backs of their heads. No word on whether they’ll be allowed a nanny for backup, like the Rees-Moggs. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, reportedly suggested making MOT tests biennial instead of annual, allowing those drivers who can still afford to run their cars to drive around on balding tyres for a bit longer, at an annual saving to the motorist of a whole £55 – unless, as motoring organisations swiftly pointed out, failing to pick up a small fault early just means a bigger garage bill later on. This was, someone solemnly told the Telegraph, the kind of “bread-and-butter policy that shows that the Conservatives are on your side”. Like the cones hotline, this sounds less like a policy and more like a cry for help. Four in 10 British households will be forced into fuel poverty this autumn if nothing changes, according to the big energy companies. Food banks are braced for unimaginable levels of demand, and even the ingenious money-saving expert Martin Lewis says he’s running out of ideas to help people make ends meet. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will almost certainly have to provide more help with fuel costs before autumn, and hinted as much in a Mumsnet webchat this week. This good news was promptly buried when he also told a disabled Mumsnetter, who is already struggling financially now, that it would be “silly” to do anything sooner, before it’s clear how bad things might actually get. At the weekend, Sunak was photographed in £600 Prada trainers walking his labrador. Nobody has yet advised letting poor people eat cake, but then the local elections are still a good week away. No wonder wiser Tories are starting to worry, as Theresa May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell tweeted recently, that the cost of living emergency will hurt them more at the ballot box than Partygate, or even the news that an anonymous MP was caught watching porn on their phone in the chamber. It’s not that people have suddenly stopped being angry about pandemic rule-breaking – if anything, this week’s court ruling that it was unlawful to shunt hospital patients into English care homes without testing them for Covid-19 has only rubbed salt into the wounds – or come to believe that misogyny doesn’t matter. But when you’re frightened of not being able to pay the rent, there isn’t room for worrying about much else. Lisa Nandy, the shadow minister for levelling up, is said to have warned the shadow cabinet recently that Labour shouldn’t concentrate overly on Partygate at the expense of the cost of living, and it’s a fair point. This isn’t about letting Boris Johnson off the hook, but understanding what the hook is for many people, and how to hang everything else from it. People can forgive a surprising amount of bad behaviour from a government in good times, but will judge it much more harshly once they start to feel personally worse off, and that’s the context in which Labour should now try to set all the admittedly juicy scandals consuming this government. Where Labour needs to address sleaze, it should argue that all this just goes to show that Tory minds are not on the job: that they are too busy knocking back the cheese and wine to realise how bad things are getting, or too busy watching porn instead of working. It’s obviously creepy for an MP to sit pawing through this stuff in full sight of his poor female colleagues. But it’s also frankly contemptuous of the people he is there to serve, whose lives may be shaped by debates to which he seemingly isn’t paying attention. Concern about inflation now tops the list of voters’ worries, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori, as it hits its highest level in three decades. The coming fear now is a potential rise in interest rates, which means mortgage payments going up. The cost of living crisis obviously still hurts the poorest most, but it’s creeping up the income scale, reaching more of the middle earners who voted Tory in 2019. YouGov now finds Labour level pegging with the Tories on the question of who is most trusted to manage the economy, once a reliable predictor – along with perceptions of the party leader – of electoral outcomes. And while sleaze may have faded somewhat from voters’ memories by the next election, every economic forecast suggests that living standards will loom larger, especially if ministers keep responding in ways that suggest they don’t get it. At prime minister’s questions this week, Keir Starmer asked why forecast growth in Britain is so low and inflation so high compared with its competitors. It’s a reasonable question, even though Labour doesn’t yet dare articulate the full answer, which is that every country faces the unavoidable consequences of a pandemic and war in Ukraine, but only Britain has simultaneously also attempted Brexit on top. It was Johnson’s response, however, insisting that employment is rising by record amounts, that was interesting – a bit too reminiscent of “you’ve never had it so good” for comfort. What ultimately kills long-serving governments – and the Tories have, through various changes of leader, been in power now for nearly 12 years – is often not one failure, so much as the pervasive sense that the country has big problems but that the incumbents have got nothing left in the tank. If it wants to see this government out of office soon, Labour needs to start hammering home the idea that it’s not just out of touch but out of ideas, imagination and energy too.

4/29/2022,"Robbie Power, whose big-race victories include the Grand National, the Cheltenham Gold Cup and the Irish Grand National, said on Thursday that he will retire from race-riding after partnering Teahupoo in the Paddy Power Champion Hurdle at Punchestown on Friday. Power landed the Grand National on Silver Birch in 2007 and the Gold Cup aboard Jessica Harrington’s Sizing John a decade later. He has struggled with a series of injuries in recent seasons, however, including a fractured hip which kept him on the sidelines from October until late January during the 2021-22 campaign. “It’s down to the injuries,” Power said after winning a handicap chase on Magic Daze at Punchestown on Thursday. “I’m 41 next month and I’m not getting any younger. I had injections in my hip but it didn’t really work. The whole family are coming tomorrow and I’ve got a couple of good rides left. My wife knew and my agent knew, but my father always told me if you tell one person you’ve told one person too many, so I was trying to keep it as quiet as possible. “There’s been several days I’ve woke up thinking this was it. If I’d won the Gold Cup [on Minella Indo, the runner-up] I’d have gone then, but Punchestown has been lucky for me so to go here, where I rode my first winner and now I’m guaranteed to ride my last one here, that will do.” The first of Power’s 31 Grade One wins before his final rides on Friday came in February 2005 on Carrigeen Victor, also trained by Harrington, while his most recent top-level success was on Colin Tizzard’s Fiddlerontheroof in the Tolworth Hurdle in January 2020. He rode 15 Grade One winners for the Harrington stable, and 11 for Tizzard, including the Betfair Chase in 2019 on Lostintranslation. Power came with a strong late run on Ashdale Bob in Thursday’s feature event, the Champion Stayers Hurdle, but it was not enough to overhaul Klassical Dream, the 11-10 favourite, who held on to win the race for the second year running by one-and-a-quarter lengths. The decision to return Newmarket’s Guineas meeting to three days has not enjoyed the most competitive of starts, with just 42 runners declared for Friday’s card at Headquarters and only 22 in the four contests being shown live on ITV4. That could see punters edging towards a competitive sprint handicap at Goodwood in search of a bet at a working person’s price, and Raasel (2.40), one of the more progressive five-furlong specialists last season, is worth an interest at around 5-1 to register his first win of 2022. It took Mick Appleby three outings and a 201-day midsummer break to work his magic on Raasel after a switch to his yard at the start of 2021, but he then reeled off a five-timer – starting with a win over this track and trip – in the space of six weeks from mid-September. He failed to extend his winning streak to six on his return to action at Musselburgh earlier this month but showed more than enough there to suggest his latest mark of 94 offers room for further progress this summer. Goodwood 1.30: Al Mubhir won with plenty to spare on his debut at Newmarket last October, with three next-time winners among the beaten horses. Newmarket 1.50: Another winner from a hot juvenile event makes his seasonal debut and Subastar looks big at around 4-1 to follow up his comfortable maiden win in September, a race in which the second, third and fourth all won next time up. Newmarket 2.25: Gubbass improved to finish about two-and-a-half lengths behind Perfect Power in the Greenham and could well boost that form before the winner’s run in the 2,000 Guineas on Saturday. Newmarket 3.00: A 5lb penalty may not be enough to stop Wizard D’Amour following up his win in a strong time at Catterick last week.

4/29/2022,"At lunchtime on Thursday parliament was prorogued – legally for once – before the state opening and Queen’s speech on 10 May. So ended one of the lowest, most dishonest and most discreditable parliamentary sessions of modern times. It was a session marked by the first conviction for a criminal offence by a sitting prime minister, by the revelation that the chancellor of the exchequer’s wife used non-dom tax status, and by the unravelling of the Conservative party’s ethical sense as ministers attempted to save an MP’s skin after he had been found guilty of lobbying. It was also marked by the sentencing of a Labour MP to a suspended 10-week prison sentence for harassment and the conviction of a Tory MP for molestation. The session has culminated in an extraordinary week of scurrilous scandals that seem all too representative of the disreputable and amoral culture exposed by the allegations of recent days. It was revealed this week that 56 MPs – allegedly including government and shadow ministers – have been referred to the Commons authorities over issues of sexual harassment and other misconduct. On the very morning of prorogation, a Tory MP was issued with a criminal charge of failing to stop after an accident, and a former Labour minister was suspended for bullying. If ever the country was well rid of a parliamentary session then it was surely this one. Grimly, this was also a session in which parliament continued to pass authoritarian and reactionary laws up until the last minute. This week, several major bills which had been barely scrutinised in detail in the Commons and had been subjected to multiple improvements by the House of Lords were finally scrabbled into law as the upper house bowed the knee. These include the elections bill, which introduces ID checks on voters and gives the government more authority to control the previously independent Electoral Commission, a move described this week by a former lord chief justice as repugnant; then there were the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, an authoritarian attempt to impose needless extra conditions on rights of assembly and protest, and the judicial review and courts bill, designed to curb scrutiny of the lawfulness of government actions. With some irony, this passed into law just as the high court ruled that the government’s Covid-era care home discharge policy, in which more than 12,500 people died, had been unlawful. The waves of slapdash and overmighty new laws passed in this session and hurriedly completed this week did not end there. They also include the health and care bill, where a few Conservative MPs rebelled to the end, but unavailingly, to try to stop the government’s effort to scrap the regular independent assessment of NHS staffing needs. Another that went to the wire was the nationality and borders bill, where peers have voted repeatedly to ensure that the laws on asylum seekers in the new legislation remain in line with the United Kingdom’s treaty obligations towards refugees; nevertheless, on Tuesday, Tory MPs voted to get rid of the clause and permit Britain to breach its international commitments yet again. It was a crowning disgrace on a long list of legislative shame. It may well not be the last one. There is no guarantee that the next parliamentary session will be different. The damage to public trust bleeds ever on. The legacy of Partygate has not played out yet; much more is to come. The readiness of many MPs, led by the prime minister, to ignore other rules seems undiminished. And the taste for cruel and slippery legislative innovation will increase as the government’s popularity slides further – as it so richly deserves to do, not least in next week’s local elections.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on the parliamentary session: a low, dishonest year | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-parliamentary-session-a-low-dishonest-year
4/29/2022,"Russia has upped the pace of its offensive in the east, according to Ukrainian officials who said the focus of attacks was near the towns of Slobozhanske and Donets, along a strategic frontline highway linking Ukraine’s second largest city, Kharkiv, with the Russian-occupied city of Izium. The Kharkiv regional governor said Russian forces were intensifying attacks from Izium, and Kharkiv regional prosecutors said two civilians were killed in Russian shelling of the village of Pokotilovka. In the north, drone footage published on Thursday showed buildings reduced to rubble in the village of Moschun, in Kyiv Oblast. Russian efforts to take the Azovstal iron and steelworks – the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged city – have been stymied by a fierce resistance and the difficulties of operating in the industrial area. A few thousand vastly outnumbered Ukrainian forces have formed a stubborn pocket of resistance in the works – a sprawling mass of tunnels and workshops spread over 4 square miles. On 21 April, Vladimir Putin ordered his forces not to storm the works, and officials in the city accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians in the nearby town of Manhush. Satellite images appeared to support the claims. Drone footage released on 19 April showed a large plume of smoke rising from the steelworks. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/29/2022,"The 2022 Venice Art Biennale belies its name. Delayed by the pandemic, it is three rather than two years since the previous edition, which bore the foreboding title May You Live In Interesting Times. The ancient Chinese curse certainly worked. Cecilia Alemani, the New York-based Italian curator of the 59th edition, which opened on Saturday, thus had extra time to prepare her exhibition, which occupies the large central pavilion in the city’s Giardini, as well as the immense spaces of an old rope-making factory in the nearby Arsenale. It shows. Her deep research has produced an unusually coherent show, which, aside from the acreage of new art, also deepens its frame of reference by showing historic work, often by surrealists such as Ithell Colquhoun, Dorothea Tanning and Remedios Varo. Such artists prefigure Ms Alemani’s contemporary preoccupations: the body in transformation, metamorphosis, the world considered from a perspective other than that of the white male. The result is an exhibition 90% created by women, along with some non-binary and transgender artists. This is a corrective to the domination of male artists in the Venice Biennale ever since its foundation in 1895, and it is echoed in the choices by individual countries of artists for national pavilions, with the US, France, the UK, Germany, Poland, Romania, Scotland and many other much-discussed shows all in the hands of women. If there were an overall mood or spirit here, it would be one of cooperation and friendship: rare are the artists who have valorised working in romantic, stoical isolation. Alberta Whittle, representing Scotland, talks of her “accomplices”, from dancers to historians, who have collaborated with her to make her film; Roma artist Małgorzata Mirga-Tas, who occupies the Polish pavilion, has stitched extraordinary patchwork “frescoes” with the help of female fellow sewers; Golden Lion winner Sonia Boyce has pushed herself to the background in order to showcase the talents of black female vocalists and composers in her pavilion for Britain. Another consequence of the pandemic on Ms Alemani’s exhibition, perhaps an unconscious one, is its sensuousness. That is despite the fact that it was mainly researched behind a screen, with the accustomed studio visits occurring virtually. The exhibition is full of sculptures that beg to be viewed from every angle and admired in all their physicality, their texturedness, their suggestion of touch. Even the film and video works tend to have a material feel, sometimes because of the setting in which they are shown, such as P. Staff’s overwhelming kaleidoscope of colours set in a mirrored room, in which the frequent violence of the content is belied by the beauty of the distorted images. An earth maze by Colombian artist Delcy Morelos might at first call to mind the post-minimalist Earth Room by American sculptor Walter de Maria – except that she has added tobacco, cocoa, cloves and other spices to the soil, such that the experience is seductively olfactory. This is art that is to be experienced “with the fullness of the body”, Ms Alemani told the Guardian last week. After two years of physical deracination, from each other as well as from art, it is exactly what feels needed now.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Venice Biennale: sensuous and serious | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-venice-biennale-sensuous-and-serious
4/29/2022,"Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party has turned its attention to June’s parliamentary elections after its defeat in the presidential contest, vowing to field candidates in every constituency and claiming the electoral system is stacked against it. “We’ve been preparing for a very long time for these elections,” said the acting party president, Jordan Bardella. “It’s essential our ideas are defended in the assembly.” He said his party would take a stand on security, immigration and French identity issues in parliament, as well as taxes. “People have to vote,” he said on the CNews TV channel. “We need an opposition.” Le Pen was beaten by the centrist Emmanuel Macron in Sunday’s presidential election by 58.5% to 41.5%, but she gained a historic score for the far right, with more than 13m votes. She will run again in the parliamentary elections in June and is likely to keep her seat in the Pas-de-Calais area in northern France. Her party has in the past struggled to translate its high number of votes in the presidential election into seats in parliament. This is partly due to a two-round parliamentary voting system that does not favour small parties, as well tactical voting to keep out the far right. Abstention is also traditionally far higher in parliamentary elections than in presidential elections, which has had a negative impact on the National Rally’s results. In 2017, the year of the last parliamentary election, Le Pen won more than 10m votes in the presidential final against Macron, but weeks later her party and its associated lawmakers won only eight seats in the 577-seat parliament. The party believes its chances are better this June because last Sunday’s presidential vote showed Le Pen had expanded her support across a greater geographical area, including a strong showing in the south-east as well as the north and north-east. “We’re in a very different situation this time because we arrived first in 159 constituencies [in the presidential vote] compared to 45 in 2017,” said Gilles Pennelle, a party delegate who is expected to be a candidate in Brittany. The party has not fixed a public target of how many seats it wants to win. Several party figures have said they hope to win at least enough to form a parliamentary grouping, which would mean at least 15 seats. A National Rally parliamentary grouping, if headed by Le Pen, would give her a bigger platform and higher visibility, useful if she decides to run for a fourth time for the presidency in 2027, which is not yet clear. In recent parliamentary elections that follow the presidential vote, the party of the newly elected president has always won a majority. A poll on Monday by Harris Interactive suggested Macron would secure a ruling majority, winning 326 to 366 seats out of 577, if he manages to strike a broad centre-right alliance with smaller parties including the rightwing Les Républicains. But an Elabe poll on Wednesday found that 61% of French people wanted a parliamentary majority that was opposed to Macron. The radical leftwinger Jean-Luc Mélenchon is attempting to form an alliance of parties on the left in an attempt to gain a maximum of seats. His party, France Unbowed, currently has 17 seats in parliament.",News/World news,Marine Le Pen’s party has high hopes for French parliament elections,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/marine-le-pens-party-has-high-hopes-for-french-parliament-elections
4/29/2022,"About 1.3 million adults have become inactive since the height of Covid, with at least 12 million taking less than an average of 30 minutes’ exercise a week, as activity levels only just begin to recover towards pre-pandemic rates. The Active Lives Adult Survey, which is the largest study of the matter in England and has 175,000 respondents, tracked adults’ activity for a year from November 2020, with the data taking into account the impact lockdowns had on activity levels. Just over 60% of adults (28 million) were active, achieving more than 150 minutes of activity a week, while 27%, or 12.4 million adults, were inactive, with less than 30 minutes of activity a week. A further 11.5%, or 5.2 million adults, were fairly active but did not reach an average of 150 minutes a week. The data also showed that while activity levels dropped during periods of lockdown restriction, since coronavirus became less prevalent and restrictions were eased activity levels had begun to stabilise and were now recovering. In mid-March 2021, 61% of the population were active, compared with 58% 12 months earlier. Activity levels are still lower than beforehand, as there are 600,000 (1.9%) fewer active adults and 1.3 million (2.6%) more inactive adults than before lockdown restrictions. However, demographic variables affected the activity levels of adults across England – 63% of men were active during this period, compared with 60% of women. Furthermore, within different socio-economic groups, those who had been unemployed long-term or had never worked were the least likely to be active, at 52%. The data also showed that minority ethnic groups, disabled people and those with long-term health conditions were still less likely to be active, with the pandemic exacerbating these inequalities. Regarding the types of activities that had showed growth before the pandemic, only walking for leisure has continued to rise. By contrast, active travel – walking or cycling to a specific place – has seen a large drop. Cycling for leisure and sport, as well as running, also fell after restrictions were eased in March 2021, as did swimming. Nigel Huddleston, a minister for sports, said he was encouraged by the survey results but there was more to be done to tackle inactivity. “I urge everyone to follow the medical advice and do 60 minutes of exercise a day for children and 150 minutes of exercise per week for adults,” he said. Tim Hollingsworth, the chief executive of Sport England, said the fact that activity levels were beginning to recover was “testament to the dedication of all of those who worked so hard to bring activities back safely when restrictions started to be eased”. He added: “Though this report clearly sets out the many challenges that lie ahead in supporting people to play more sport and lead more active lives, the key investments and resources we were able to provide during the harshest of restrictions also played an important role in helping sports get back on their feet.“That the data tells us that this initial recovery is not universal is not a surprise and that is exactly why our Uniting the Movement strategy focuses resources and funding disproportionally towards the people and places that need the most support to be active.”",News/Society,Number of inactive adults in England rises by 1.3m since Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/28/number-of-inactive-adults-in-england-rises-by-more-than-1m-since-covid-peak
4/29/2022,"Furloughed and fed up during the first Covid lockdown, Jason Williams decided to have a go at gardening. His gateway plant was a French marigold, bought from B&Q, and he spent the following months making YouTube videos as he learned what thrives on an 18th floor balcony in central Manchester. Unlike the rest of us who picked up a trowel for the first time during the pandemic, Williams’ lockdown “cloud garden” was such a success that he has been invited to recreate it for this year’s Chelsea flower show. The 35-year-old bar manager will be making his Chelsea debut in the show’s “small space gardening” section, which was introduced last year as a response to the boom in balcony and container horticulture. Describing his gardening style as “perfectly imperfect”, Williams has built up a dedicated online following for his candid videos. Starring as the Cloud Gardener (Cloudy to his fans), he is sometimes dressed in a kimono teamed with what appears to be a silken shower cap, occasionally weeping with joy or despair. He gives as much airtime to his failures as his successes, paying tender homage to the plants he has inadvertently killed (though he prefers the term “unalived”). The sunflowers were a flop (“the leaves are too big and they suffer really harshly from windburn, so I unalived them”), but the passionfruit and grapes are going great guns. One day he dreams of harvesting enough to make wine. He has learned a lot about gardening at height, where the winds from the Lancashire plain can rip the head off a delicate rose but temperatures can sometimes be a whole 10C higher than at ground level. And who knew that bumblebees could reach the 18th floor? Williams prides himself on being honest, speaking out about his anxiety and depression, and when things go awry. “On social media, there is this urge to make everything perfect and so everything has to be filtered. But all throughout my content there’s absolutely no filtering, there’s no colour adjustments,” he said. “I purposely will show everybody my dead plants because I think it’s really important so that people understand that gardening is challenging.” When he applied for Chelsea he stressed that he wanted his show garden to be accessible “to show what can be done in a realistic way”. His target audience is “people who would never even think about Chelsea”. All of the plants in his Chelsea garden have been tried and tested on his Manchester balcony, and can be bought in a bog-standard garden centre. “What I didn’t want to do is create some show garden masterpiece that people cannot replicate, or if they did, they would fail and be like, ‘Ah, I don’t have the green thumb’, and stop,” he said. He wants to challenge the idea that black people don’t garden. “We do. You just don’t tend to see it on TV.” There was Danny Clarke, the Black Gardener, he said, and Tayshan Hayden-Smith, a footballer who now appears on Your Garden Made Perfect. “But there’s not much representation for young black males especially,” said Williams. “I’m hoping that there’ll be some young gardeners and some budding young designers out there, who will see me and it might give them the belief that they can actually appear at Chelsea too. I mean, I have no gardening or landscaping experience whatsoever. So if I can make it, then so can they.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,From the 18th floor to cloud nine: high-rise gardener gets Chelsea flower show spot,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/28/from-the-18th-floor-to-chelsea-cloud-gardener-to-exhibit-at-flower-show
4/29/2022,"It wasn’t the best of adverts for parliament. Every few years or so, MPs let out a collective howl of outrage and decide that something really must be done about sexual misconduct in Westminster. And every few years or so almost nothing substantially changes. Not so long ago it was pornography found on Damian Green’s Commons computer. Now another as-yet unnamed Tory MP has upped the ante by watching pornography on his phone in the Commons’ chamber. Give it a few more years and some sexually incontinent MP will be masturbating live on Parliament TV. That was far from the end of it, though. There was also a shadow cabinet minister accused of making sexually inappropriate remarks about a female Welsh MP. Not to mention the 56 other MPs, including three cabinet members, who are under investigation for sexual harassment. It makes you wonder how some male MPs ever find time to do any work. So it was Ben Wallace’s bad luck that he was the minister given the short straw of explaining all this on the morning media round. The defence secretary did not cover himself in glory. A simple “This is unacceptable,” and “All women should be treated with respect,” would have done. Instead he chose to play the “long hours, hard-working, late bars” card. As if that was somehow an excuse and any man who worked late and then went to the pub couldn’t help but revert to a naturally sexist self. Clearly some MPs must congratulate themselves for getting through the day without sexually harassing anyone. All things considered, then, the prorogation of parliament probably couldn’t come a moment too soon. A chance to wipe both hard drives and the green benches. Hazmat suits all round. But before the Commons rose for 12 days until the state opening on 10 May, there was still a handful of MPs actually trying to do some work. Labour’s Thangam Debbonaire was trying to secure a correction for one of the lies that Boris Johnson had told during prime minister’s questions. Good luck with that. Conservative Peter Bottomley was waiting in vain for Nadine Dorries to make a statement on the privatisation of Channel 4. Like the Convict, the culture secretary is notoriously reluctant to make herself accountable to her peers. Along the committee corridor, though, history was being made. Almost invariably, James Cleverly is the stupidest person in any room he enters. It’s a massive failure of nominative determinism. But just this once, Jimmy Dimly got an even break. At the meeting of the European scrutiny committee, he got the opportunity to feel what it must be like to be a towering intellect. It just pays to keep the right company. Step forward committee chair, Bill Cash, Tory MPs Richard Drax, David Jones, Greg Smith and Anne Marie Morris, and the near-silent suspended Scottish National MP Margaret Ferrier. Names that Cleverly will treasure as long as he lives. The subject, inevitably, was the Northern Ireland protocol. Something that every Tory Brexiter now goes out of their way to distance themselves from, having greeted its arrival as a triumph. Then again, even David Frost has no idea these days that he negotiated the protocol. Scarcely a week passes without him writing in the Telegraph about what a hopeless shitshow it is. Lord Frost is in for a hell of a shock when he eventually meets himself. Cash got things going with a general diatribe that Dimly, in his Foreign Office role, should make sure he carried on meeting Brits as well as Europeans, before Drax and Jones moved on to the Northern Ireland Heart of Darkness. Was the minister aware of just how evil the protocol was and that the EU must have hypnotised the UK negotiators into agreeing to it? Did the Americans know just how damaging the protocol was to the NI peace process? New EU directives made NI less and less aligned with the rest of Britain. It was all dreadful. We needed to trigger article 16 before the Apocalypse. “Hmm,” muttered Jimmy D. He wasn’t quite sure how to break it to this coven of halfwits. The problem was ours not the EU’s. They didn’t force us to sign anything. If we were up shit creek it was entirely of our doing. In the end, he decided it was best to say nothing. Why get into dangerous territory and admit on the record that he and the government were out of their depth and the Convict had lied to the country to get Brexit done. So he just said it was all on a need-to-know basis – Cash and co definitely had no need to know – and he’d maybe update them some time in the next parliament. Down at the Eurotunnel control centre, Jacob Rees-Mogg was also struggling to come to terms with the realities of Brexit. Just as the Northern Ireland protocol was slowly separating NI from the rest of the UK, so the new trade agreement with the EU would cost the UK a fortune in checks and tariffs. So the minister for Brexit opportunities was there to tell the nation that the opportunity he had identified was that Brexit was prohibitively expensive and would put thousands of companies out of business if properly implemented. Which he wasn’t going to do. He was going to delay it for a fourth time. So we would continue to take any foods from the EU unchecked. Viva Brexit. Viva sovereignty.",News/Politics,Is there no end to Tory MPs’ sexual misconduct? | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/is-there-no-end-to-tory-mps-sexual-misconduct
4/29/2022,"Spain have been kicked out of the 2023 Rugby World Cup and will be replaced by Romania after it was determined that Los Leones fielded an ineligible player, allegedly with the help of a forged passport, in qualifying. Spain had reached the World Cup for the first time since 1999 after a dramatic win over Portugal in March but have been docked 10 points and dumped out of next year’s tournament in France. An independent disciplinary panel appointed by World Rugby found that the South Africa-born prop Gavin van den Berg appeared for Spain in two matches, against the Netherlands in 2021 and 2022, without having qualified on residency grounds. The panel ruled that Spain should be docked five points a match and fined £25,000, paving the way for Romania to reach the World Cup and Portugal to advance to November’s repechage qualification tournament. It is the second consecutive World Cup cycle that has been dogged by problems over ineligible players with Spain also caught up in the controversy surrounding the 2019 tournament. Then, Romania, Spain and Belgium were all found guilty, leading to Russia reaching the World Cup. At the time Spain were given a £50,000 suspended fine which they are now liable for. Romania join South Africa, Ireland, Scotland and most likely Tonga in pool B at France 2023 with Portugal entering the four-team final qualification tournament. Romania declared “justice is done” after learning of the decision while the Spanish federation, which has the right to appeal against the outcome, described the verdict as “very harsh” before admitting that it came “as a result of an alleged forgery of the aforementioned player’s passport”. It is believed that part of the issue centres around how Van den Berg split his time between Spain and South Africa, an issue made more complicated by travel restrictions due to the pandemic. A statement from the Spanish federation said: “As this very harsh sanction occurs as a result of an alleged forgery of the aforementioned player’s passport, the Spanish Rugby Federation continues with the extraordinary disciplinary procedure initiated at the time.” Meanwhile, in a double fitness boost for Eddie Jones before England’s summer tour of Australia, Courtney Lawes and Tom Curry – both of whom captained the side during the Six Nations – are set to return from injury this weekend. Lawes was described as “Frankenstein’s monster” by Northampton earlier this week because of the gruesome nature of his dislocated thumb but whereas it was feared he may not feature again this season, he comes straight into Saints’ starting lineup against Harlequins on Friday night.

4/29/2022,"Experienced Tory MPs with a “neutral” attitude to Boris Johnson are being sought to sit on the committee judging whether he misled parliament over Partygate, following concerns that its current membership is too aligned to the government. Johnson is facing an investigation by the privileges committee into whether he lied to the Commons when he said he did not know about any parties in Downing Street during lockdown. It was thought the current membership of seven – four Tories, two Labour, and one SNP MP – would conduct the investigation. However, two of the Tories are government aides and the Labour chair, Chris Bryant, has recused himself from the investigation for having already said he thought Johnson should quit. With huge pressure on the MPs conducting the inquiry, the Tories have accepted that the inquiry needs to be undertaken by parliamentarians who are not on the government payroll, and are experienced enough not to be seeking preferment from No 10. Parliamentary rules state that ministerial aides should not be allowed to sit on committees, but this has been ignored in recent years. Some of the senior Tories being mooted include former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, former justice secretary Sir Robert Buckland, who was previously a member of the committee, former culture secretary Maria Miller and Jeremy Wright, another former attorney general. From Labour, Harriet Harman, the former deputy leader, is believed to have been tapped up. Sir Bernard Jenkin, a current senior member of the committee, may stay on the body. However, Laura Farris and Alberto Costa, two government aides, will be dropped. However, Tory MPs in particular are proving reluctant to sit on the committee given the sensitivity and impact of their decision, which could lead to Johnson’s resignation if he is found to have knowingly misled the House of Commons. There is also an issue with finding candidates to sit on the committee who have not expressed a view on the prime minister’s conduct over Partygate. Wright, for example, has publicly given his opinion that Johnson should go if he knowingly broke the law and therefore misled the Commons, as well as saying more recently that he can “see how a single mistake can be forgiven, even when it is made by a prime minister”. The privileges committee will have a Conservative majority with candidates picked by the party’s authorities. However, the membership will have to be approved by the House of Commons, so the chosen MPs will need to command the confidence of a wide range of Tory backbenchers – including the prime minister’s critics. One source with knowledge of the process said Tory MPs were trying to dodge the job of having to sit in judgment over the prime minister, knowing it to be a “poisoned chalice”. The committee will not begin examining evidence against Johnson until both the conclusion of the Metropolitan police’s inquiries into lockdown breaking in Number 10 and Whitehall – which have already yielded one fine for the prime minister – and a Whitehall report by the civil servant Sue Gray, which will be published after the Met’s case is closed. Some Conservatives have expressed scepticism that the committee is likely to report before the autumn or even before the end of the year – given the length of time for the Met to finish its investigation. Bryant told the BBC he believed Johnson would be forced to quit by the end of May, but Number 10 has said he has no intention of resigning if he receives more fines from the Met or if he is criticised in Gray’s report. In an exchange with Keir Starmer in January, the prime minister has acknowledged it is precedent for ministers to resign if they are found to have misled parliament.",News/Politics,‘Poisoned chalice’: senior Tories sought for place on committee judging PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/boris-johnson-partygate-senior-tories-privileges-committee
4/29/2022,"The Snapchat founder, Evan Spiegel, has dismissed Facebook’s “metaverse” ambitions as “ambiguous and hypothetical” as he announced a raft of new augmented reality features coming to phones and Snap’s experimental AR Spectacles over the next year. Speaking ahead of the Snap Partner Summit, the company’s flagship annual event, Spiegel argued Snapchat was uniquely placed to guide the next decade of technology thanks to the company’s vast array of augmented reality services, such as the “lenses” that are used by millions of people every day. With 332 million daily users and a market cap of $46.95bn (£38bn), Snap is comfortably larger than Twitter, even after the acquisition offer for the latter from Elon Musk, but gets a fraction of the attention. “That’s something that sort of comes along with them being the ‘public town square’,” Spiegel says. “We’re happy with the value that we provide to our community – and society.” He cites statistics that “over 90% of Snapchatters say they feel comfortable, happy, and connected when they use Snapchat”, which is “ranked the No 1 happiest platform when compared to other apps”. “There’s now like 250 million people engaging with AR everyday on the smartphone alone,” Spiegel said. “And that’s on this tiny little screen that you’re looking through and you’re using your thumbs on. So we believe that trying to break some of those constraints, and go into a truly immersive and interactive AR experience, will be really important in the future.” Snap’s latest Spectacles have only shipped in prototype form to creators around the world: with a 15- to 30-minute battery life and a severely restricted display, they are intended to inspire creators with the possibility of future versions of the same hardware. But, Spiegel says, the next generation is already in development. “It just changes the way you interact when you can walk around and use your hands, and see computing brought to life. The strength of our AR glasses is the AR platform behind it, met with hundreds of hundreds of thousands of developers, millions of lenses, and really, really advanced tools that continue to evolve rapidly.” Core to that evolution is an update called Lens Cloud that lets developers for both Snapchat and Spectacles build AR experiences that are firmly placed in the real world. One set of tools lets Lenses be anchored to any location around the world: Lego has used it to build virtual ferris wheels, rollercoasters and slides around the streets of central London. Another feature lets two users of the same AR lens interact with each other for the first time, occupying the same virtual spaces and playing the same games. The updates sound like they could be the foundations of a shared virtual universe of the type that Facebook recently decided was so fundamental to its future that it even rebranded the company as Meta. But, Spiegel says, the word “metaverse” is never uttered in Snap’s offices. “The reason why we don’t use that word is because it’s pretty ambiguous and hypothetical. Just ask a room of people how to define it, and everyone’s definition is totally different. “But one of the big overarching concepts people have is that a lot of those tools are designed to replace reality. Whereas when we talk about AR, we’re trying to augment the real world around you. So our fundamental bet is that people actually love the real world: they want to be together in person with their friends. “And, of course, our vision is real today, with glasses that you can use today, and a platform that works at scale today. So we try to stay away from those hypotheticals, because we’re focused on what we’re building right now.” Spiegel also revealed Pixy, “the world’s friendliest flying camera” – a palm-sized autonomous drone that can be used to capture outdoor activities. With a single button to control it, users just hold Pixy in their hand and select one of five modes, including “follow” – the drone will recognise and follow its owner taking video on the way – and “reveal” – the drone will fly to its maximum altitude and film the reverse pan as it goes. “Everything you need to capture the spontaneity and fun of the moment from new perspectives is right in the palm of your hand,” Spiegel said. “There are no controllers. There’s no complex set-up. Simply select a flight path and let Pixy take it from there, floating above you as it captures photos and videos. And it knows when and where to return, landing gently in the palm of your hand.” The device is available for purchase from Thursday for $229.99 to customers in the US and France.",News/Technology,Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel dismisses Facebook’s metaverse as ‘hypothetical’,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/28/snapchat-evan-spiegel-dismisses-facebook-metaverse-hypothetical

Local environmental authorities said that the polluted foam – which has been seen in the town several times over the past few years – is increasing because of people dumping waste, chemicals and detergents into the river system. Heavy rains have added to the problem. The Mosquera mayor’s office tweeted photos of the toxic foam, alongside town officials. The mayor, Gian Gerometta, claimed that the buildup of pollution was partly due to a blockage caused by plants in the river. “We are aware of the risks that can arise due to this phenomenon,” he tweeted . Authorities also warned locals against getting too close to the foam, which is thought to cause respiratory problems and skin irritations. “It is important that children are kept away as we do not yet totally know what this material is,” Edwin García, a government environmental official, told local radio station Caracol, adding that a treatment plant in the region has been working to decontaminate the river since 2020. “We will be monitoring and cleaning the entire river to prevent foam from continuing to accumulate.”",News/World news,‘The smell is terrible’: toxic foam clouds float through streets of Bogotá suburb,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/colombia-toxic-foam-clouds-polluted-river-bogota
4/29/2022,"Until this week, the government repeatedly rejected the notion of a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, which have been reaping huge profits from sky-high energy prices. But the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, hinted at a possible U-turn on Wednesday, telling Mumsnet that such a policy was “never off the table”, and would be looked at if investment by companies in Britain’s energy security failed to materialise. The idea is that the money raised could be spent on easing the cost of living crisis for those households most under pressure from soaring prices. So what would a windfall tax on oil and gas companies be worth to the Treasury? Labour has repeatedly argued that a one-off, year-long windfall levy could raise £1.2bn to fund discounts on home energy bills, which are already at a record high of £1,971 for an average dual-fuel tariff, with a further eye-watering rise on the way in October. The party has proposed levying an extra 10% on the corporation tax paid by oil companies that are active in the North Sea. This would be on top of the 19% rate they pay on their profits. This would not only affect well-known firms such as BP and Shell but also lesser-known ones such as Harbour Energy – which actually produces more oil from the North Sea than any other extractor: about 163,000 barrels last year. The sector’s big firms have certainly done extremely well out of the high oil and gas prices that have sent energy bills and the cost of filling up a car to record highs. BP made a profit of £10bn last year, admitting it has “more cash than we know what to do with”. The company was a “cash machine”, its chief executive, Bernard Looney, said – around the same time as dismissing calls for a windfall tax. Shell did even better at £15bn, after record quarterly earnings in the last three months of 2021. Both companies will report first-quarter figures next week, including any boost connected to the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday, Sunak appeared to leave the door ajar for a levy – but one that would penalise those oil firms that fail to do their best to help the UK squeeze more drops out of the North Sea. “What I would say is that if we don’t see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that’s something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things,” he said. It is not immediately clear how the government would set the criteria for judging which companies are underinvesting. In practice, forecasts of increased investment in the North Sea suggest very few firms, if any, are likely to be penalised under current circumstances. Spending in the North Sea is forecast to hit £21bn over the next five years, according to a report published last September by the UK oil trade body Offshore Energies UK, a higher annual rate than the £3.7bn of investment in 2020. Habour Energy, which produces a fraction of either BP or Shell’s global output, increased its spending on new and existing projects from $556m to $640m last year. It plans to increase its spending further this year, indicating it would be unlikely to fall foul of any penalty for perceived underinvestment. Shell is already considering a U-turn on its decision to abandon the Cambo oilfield, which lies about 75 miles north-west of the Shetland Islands. The company said this month it planned to invest £20bn-£25bn in the UK energy system over the next decade, although 75% will be on offshore wind, hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure, rather than North Sea oilfields. But it too is planning more extraction. “We plan to continue to invest in the North Sea,” BP said in its latest annual report.",News/Business,How would a UK windfall tax on oil and gas profits work?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/how-would-a-uk-windfall-tax-on-oil-and-gas-profits-work
4/29/2022,"Ben Stokes was hailed as the epitome of what England need to reverse their Test fortunes after being confirmed as the team’s new captain in Rob Key’s first public appearance as the director of men’s cricket. Key, 10 days into the role and currently hunting for two new head coaches, called his decision to install Stokes as Joe Root’s successor “easy” and pledged that England, bottom of the World Test Championship after a winless winter, would get back to playing their strongest XI rather than overthinking selection. This means that, subject to form and fitness, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad will be back in the fold. During recent talks with Key about his promotion, Stokes insisted the decision to omit the veteran pair from the recent 1-0 defeat in the Caribbean be reversed before the first Test against New Zealand at Lord’s on 2 June. Stokes is not due to speak until next Tuesday but described taking on the captaincy as a “privilege” in a statement; Key, injecting a much-needed dose of plain speaking into English cricket at his own unveiling, is convinced the all-rounder can thrive after canvassing a range of views from those who know him best. “Ben epitomises everything our red-ball team needs,” said Key. “I just want him to go out and lead from the front. I always think that in leaders, one of the most important things – especially if you’re a great player, which, make no mistake, he is – is a lot of compassion and empathy. He has got that. “He’s always talking about other people around him and what’s best for the side. He’s not someone with a massive ego who is thinking: ‘What’s best for Ben Stokes?’ He genuinely thinks that he’s the best person to lead England forward – and I agree.” As well as expressing his pride, Stokes used his statement to thank Root for being a “massive part” of his development as a leader in the dressing room after two spells as the Yorkshireman’s vice-captain. It may be that Root’s decision to stay on as captain after the Ashes debacle and plough through to the Caribbean goes down as a selfless act of friendship, knowing that while he himself was drained, his likely successor was not yet ready either. On Thursday, Root tweeted: “Always got each other’s backs. Congratulations mate, I’ll be right with you every step of the way.” Either way, Stokes needed those three Tests against West Indies – which featured a thunderous century in Barbados – to get back into form after a rusty, undercooked comeback in Australia that followed his four-month break from all cricket last summer. The hiatus, in part to attend to his mental health, raises obvious concerns about the strains of captaincy but Key does not share these. He said: “When you [interview someone for a job], if they’re keen they’re going to tell you everything you want to hear, so I talked to a lot of people that know him and that he trusts. Every single one of them said he’d be an excellent captain. And they were very honest about the best way to manage him. So it became an easy decision.” Key put the break down to a wider issue which left his own predecessor, Ashley Giles, hamstrung during the previous two years: amid a packed schedule and the suffocating nature of the biosecure environments required to navigate the pandemic, England’s focus became fixture fulfilment, rather than how best to win. To that end, Key described Root’s personal form with the bat while results went south – scoring 1,708 runs in 2021, some 802 more than the next best in the world – as “one of the great sporting achievements”. Key has spoken at length with the outgoing captain in the past week and said he was in awe of his hunger. Anderson and Broad have similarly been contacted. Key, who will chair selection meetings until a permanent selector is hired, said: “I told them: ‘For my money, you guys are available for selection for that first Test match.’ And when I met Ben one of the first things he said was: ‘I want the best team out there and Jimmy and Broady are a part of that. If they’re the best bowlers, then they play.’ I said I agree.” It remains to be seen who will serve as vice-captain to Stokes, with Key yet to decide on a role which could have huge significance given the all-rounder’s injury record. Even now, as the 30-year-old prepares to start his season for Durham against Worcestershire next week, he is returning from a knee problem. Key shared his optimism that red-ball talent in England has not dried up but rather the mentality must change. “Are the batsmen hopeless with no ability and no talent? I don’t think that’s the case at all,” he said. “Have we been getting the best out of them? Absolutely not.” Key did, however, concede there is much to do after personally witnessing Australia, the No 1 side in the world, secure their recent series 1-0 win in Pakistan. “We’re way off them at the moment. But do I think we’ve got the talent to be able to compete with them? Absolutely. Is it going to take a bit of time to get there? Probably.” The response will be to split the coaching teams by way of format, with Key “optimistic” about having a Test head coach in place by the end of the month even if the likelihood of an overseas appointment means possible hurdles such as relocation and securing a visa in time. Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford and Simon Katich are the frontrunners ahead of next Friday’s deadline.",Sport/Sport,Stokes starts England Test captaincy by demanding Broad and Anderson return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/28/ben-stokes-succeeds-joe-root-as-england-test-cricket-captain
4/29/2022,"Can nobody push Liz Truss back into her cage? In her “British war aims” speech at Mansion House, proposing to drive Russia back to its pre-2014 borders, she simply echoed Vladimir Putin’s sick dream of recreating a mythic imperial past (Putin threatens Ukraine allies as Truss urges ‘doubling down’ on support for Kyiv, 27 April). But this is not 1945. The Ukraine war is not going to end with Russia’s unconditional surrender – the only terms on which Russia would leave Crimea. It will probably end in messy stalemate, followed by murky diplomacy. Crimea, casually transferred from Russia to Ukraine on a dictator’s whim in 1954, remained overwhelmingly Russian in sentiment even before the rigged referendum of 2014. The Donbas may have to be partitioned under UN auspices (to the inevitable fury of both communities), as Upper Silesia was partitioned by the League of Nations in 1921. Truss’s insistence on restoring previous “territorial integrity” boundaries to states that the UK supports – Georgia or Ukraine – is to license a bloodbath if Georgia invaded “lost” Abkhazia, or mass resistance if Ukraine tried to suppress Russian identities in Crimea.Neal AschersonLondon  Dan Sabbagh’s nuanced and sober analysis of the Ukraine conflict (27 April) focuses on the expansive nature of the rhetoric used by both parties. The absurd Russian claims of “denazifying” Ukraine have been rightly ridiculed, but grandiose statements by western leaders, indicating that we now seek a strategic defeat of Russia, only help the Russian narrative that this is an existential war of national survival for them. Instead, our leaders might do better to adopt the “talk softly and carry a big stick” approach; after all, brave words will not stop a single Russian tank, but a timely and sotto voce delivery of anti-tank weapons might. That will require a degree of message discipline not seen so far: Liz Truss speculating about a decade of war and James Heappey musing on Ukrainian targeting inside Russia do not help to control the narrative. Putin will get the message that aggression won’t work, but declaring that we intend to rub his face in it, especially as the war is still very active and he is not yet defeated, is naive and dangerous; he needs a ladder to climb down. Better to stick rigorously to the line that we are supporting Ukraine to defend itself.Simon Diggins (Retired colonel)Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire  Liz Truss ignored the peace role of the UN and the current efforts of its secretary-general in her Mansion House speech. She offers instead the prospect of more war and dangerous escalation. Britain, as a security council member, shares the “primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security” (article 24 of the UN charter). The huge majority of UN members who condemned Russian aggression in the general assembly on 2 March want the war to stop, not to continue, and that should be the focus of British diplomacy.John GittingsAuthor, The Glorious Art of Peace  It seems that Liz Truss is pushing her leadership bid without a care for what the consequences might be for the country she seeks to lead. The provision of weapons is the right thing to do, but there is a special kind of foolishness in saying exactly what is being provided. Silence from Ms Truss would be welcome, and perhaps show that she is worthy of the office to which she aspires.Dr Roger SlackWistaston, Cheshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
