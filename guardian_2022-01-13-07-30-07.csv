1/13/2022,"By the time this was over, it was way after midnight, they were barely able to walk any more let alone run, and they were 6,500km from home but Real Madrid had made it. The last ball had been caught by Thibaut Courtois and he lay on the turf, clutching their place in the final of the Spanish Super Cup, Fede Valverde’s extra-time goal having settled a match that ultimately had the winner everyone expected but did not play out as anticipated. A fun night could have gone either way, from 1-0 to 1-1, 2-1 to 2-2 and ultimately 3-2. It went Madrid’s, the fifth goal of the night scored at the point when Barcelona seemed to have taken a hold. And although they were defeated by Valverde’s long run from his area to theirs, they had come close. Above all, they had come to look like a team again, especially once Pedri and Ansu Fati had been introduced. This looked like a proper clásico too – on the pitch at least. It had finished the way it started, Barcelona caught and Madrid taking advantage.  Twenty-four of the 122 minutes had gone when Karim Benzema sneaked up on Sergio Busquets and nicked the ball off his toe. By the time the Barcelona captain realised what was happening, they were gone. Luka Modric immediately returned the ball to Benzema who released Vinicius, sprinting into the area to thump high into the net. Vinicius had taken just two touches; the entire move took just four of them, and that was a feature of Madrid’s game. The goal had been coming and had always been likely to come a little like that. The space they were afforded was an invitation they were not going to turn down, running through almost at will, a move that started in their own area a moment earlier having ended with Marco Asensio bending over, already offering a portrait of what was to come. Yet if here was a feeling of inevitability about it, Madrid’s superiority presupposed, Barcelona responded well – even if that sense of vulnerability never went away, the feeling that Madrid could reach their area in the blink of an eye and with minimal resistance. Luuk de Jong was at the heart of it, and if that may feel counter cultural for a coach like Xavi, it was effective – beyond just the fact that he got the equaliser just before half time. If the finish was fortunate, a deflection off Éder Militão’s attempted clearance, he had already twice had headers saved. Barcelona had found a foothold that was soon a big step forward when the break brought the return of Pedri from injury, he and Abde coming on for the debutant Ferran Torres and Frenkie de Jong. Not coincidentally, it also brought a change. In three minutes, Ousmane Dembélé, Pedri and De Jong all had chances, one after the other. Five minutes after that, Dembélé struck a volley wide when the position demanded a better finish. And yet it was Madrid who took the lead again. A lovely touch from Modric led to an even lovelier touch from Benzema, dragging the ball back, turning and firing. The shot hit the post but he was back again the very next minute when Ferland Mendy escaped Dani Alves to start a move that ended with him turning in from close range. This still wasn’t over, not by a long shot. Barcelona went for it, exposing themselves and Madrid too. With seven minutes to go, Fati leapt to head in Jordi Alba’s superb cross to make it 2-2, then Courtois had to move fast to stop Dembélé and Nacho made a superb block on Pedri to take it into extra time where Abde headed wide. Barcelona’s grip grew ever tighter until in the 99th minute Madrid broke through it, slipping between their fingers, up and running again, the field opening in front of them. Casemiro charged, Rodrygo played his part and Valverde arrived to finish. Courtois making a double save on 100 minutes, Abde flashed one past the post on 108 and both teams got a clear chance each in the very last minute, when cramp had gripped them all, Fati and Rodrygo unable to the take them, but it was Madrid who were still standing.

1/13/2022,"Guns and Lies started in 2019 as a year-long project investigating what worked to reduce the daily toll of gun violence in California’s San Francisco Bay area, a region that had defied expectations and seen a dramatic decline in gun homicides. The project continued after its first anniversary to explore the convergence of gun violence, the coronavirus pandemic and the movement for racial justice in the region. Now in its third year, the series has expanded its scope to the entire state, examining the dynamics behind the renewed rise in daily gun violence and spotlighting community-led solutions. Our stories delve into the intersection of gun violence with education, gentrification, policing, criminal justice reform, inequality and health. The project is committed to challenging the myths and misconceptions of gun violence in national conversations by highlighting the people and innovative programs working to curb violence, offering rigorous data-driven analysis, and amplifying the voices of those affected by everyday gun violence.  Go here for more details on how to pitch a story for the series. The project is funded in part by a grant to theguardian.org from the California Wellness Foundation (Cal Wellness). Created in 1992 as a private independent foundation, Cal Wellness aims to protect and improve the health and wellness of the people of California by increasing access to healthcare, quality education, good jobs, healthy environments and safe neighborhoods.

1/13/2022,"The Guardian US’s Guns and Lies series covers the daily impact of gun violence across California communities and the people within these communities working to prevent it. America’s gun violence crisis is driven not by high-profile mass shootings but by everyday gun deaths in Black and brown communities. During the pandemic, these communities have witnessed a historic surge in daily shootings, one that the country has barely acknowledged and most Americans have hardly begun to understand.  We’re commissioning reported stories and comment pieces to run in the series in 2022. We’re looking for coverage that goes beyond the news to: Highlight the daily realities of gun violence in California communities. Spotlight bright people and innovative programs working to curb violence. Reveal gaps in resources and policies aimed at curbing gun violence or serving survivors. Correct misconceptions about the gun violence crisis. Illuminate the dynamics behind the recent rise in gun violence in California and across the country. We’re particularly interested in stories that are centered in communities outside of the Bay Area and Los Angeles, and tackle aspects of gun violence that the series hasn’t covered in depth. We publish a range of story types and formats, from news features to enterprise stories, investigative reporting, Q&As, comment pieces, first-person accounts, photo essays, data visualizations, and audio and video stories. We’re also interested in projects with a community engagement component, which amplify the experiences of gun violence interrupters and survivors. Send us your pitch through the form below.

1/13/2022,"First the passion killer. The opening goal was always going to be vital given the aggregate score at kick-off and, when Antonio Rüdiger scored it for Chelsea, it felt as if that was that. Thomas Tuchel’s European champions are not in the habit of conceding three goals in a game. It has only happened three times under him. Then the high jinx, which brought the entertainment value, at least for the neutral and the travelling fans. It was not funny for Tottenham, who saw the referee, Andre Marriner, wrongly award two penalties, which he had to rescind after advice from VAR, and then disallow a Harry Kane goal. Marriner was told by the technology that Kane was offside.  There would also be concern in the closing stages when Spurs supporters in the South Stand alerted the stewards to what appeared to be a medical emergency. A host of personnel in high-vis jackets were quickly on the scene and there was a lengthy pause. Chelsea march on. Their followers chorused the name of Antonio Conte in the 70th minute, paying their respects to the now Spurs manager for his work at their club over two seasons from 2016, when he won the Premier League and FA Cup. But it was Tuchel who they saluted long into the night, this his third semi-final win in three attempts. Conte had been preoccupied with the gap between his current and former employers and, although Spurs fought until the last, it was again there for all to see during the first half when matters were settled. Spurs were booed off by the home crowd at half-time and there were more jeers from those that remained upon the full-time whistle. The first leg had been one-sided and the only wonder was that Chelsea were unable to bring a decisive lead across town. How Spurs had laboured at the back and yet Conte, missing the injured Eric Dier and Cristian Romero, decided to try, try again, starting with the same five that he had used at Stamford Bridge. It felt risky. Conte’s change had been in goal and it was a surprise one, Pierluigi Gollini preferred to Hugo Lloris. Gollini has not convinced since his arrival over the summer and, although he made an important early block to deny Romelu Lukaku, who had bullied Ben Davies to get on to a long pass from Rüdiger, he was soon picking the ball out of his net, having failed to deal with a Mason Mount corner. Tottenham’s marking had disintegrated, nobody picking the run of Rüdiger, and Gollini never looked like getting there first. Rüdiger’s header was scruffy. He appeared to turn his back slightly but he did enough to direct the ball on target. Gollini clattered into him, having led with his fist. Each replay looked worse for him. Chelsea settled into their stride, pressing high, Spurs’s defensive insecurities bubbling. One sequence in the 15th minute rather summed things up. Davinson Sánchez gave Gollini a back pass on his left foot that he did not want and Spurs lived on the edge of their nerves as they tried to play out, averting disaster, but then seeing Sánchez play a loose pass and the ball go out for a Chelsea throw. The Spurs defenders did not look comfortable in possession and it was a nervous watch for their fans. Tuchel had persisted with his 4-2-2-2 system from the first leg but, this time, it was Timo Werner up front alongside Lukaku. Werner had flickered before the goal, lobbing high after a poor clearing header from Sánchez and crossing following a Lukaku flick. The ball ran through for Malang Sarr, playing at left-back, and his shot was blocked by Giovani Lo Celso. Shortly after Rüdiger’s goal, Callum Hudson-Odoi worked Gollini before Lukaku flashed a header wide from another Werner cross. What of Spurs before the interval? They wasted two well-placed free-kicks, the first by Kane early on, the second by Lo Celso with the final action. That had been awarded after VAR overruled a penalty award, confirming that a Rüdiger foul on Pierre-Emile Højbjerg had been outside the area. Tottenham’s best moment of the half came when Højbjerg sent a deflected curler just wide in the 32nd minute after good work by Kane. From the corner, Sánchez flicked on and Kane, sliding in at the far post, could not get a touch. Emerson Royal also blew a chance following a nice ball from Lucas Moura, his first touch heavy and taking him too wide. The shot was easy for Kepa Arrizabalaga. The boos were lusty upon the half-time whistle. Conte had started with Harry Winks over Oliver Skipp in midfield, a reward for the former’s high-energy performance in Sunday’s FA Cup win over Morecambe. Winks, though, struggled with his passing, missing an easy one to release Kane on 54 minutes. A penny for Tanguy Ndombele’s thoughts at that point. Ndombele was not even on the bench after his high-profile, low speed walk-off upon his substitution against Morecambe. At least Andre Marriner appeared determined to make a game of it. The referee had jaws on the floor when he pointed to the spot for the second time after Arrizabalaga executed a perfect tackle on Moura following Kane’s slightly heavy pass. It was a grim-faced trudge over to the monitor for Marriner to see his error and there would be yet more VAR intervention after Højbjerg had robbed Jorginho following Arrizabalaga’s dangerous pass. Moura worked the ball to Kane, who rammed home but, as the technology would clarify, the centre-forward was offside.",Sport/Football,Chelsea outclass Tottenham as Rüdiger seals Carabao Cup final spot,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/tottenham-chelsea-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report
1/13/2022,"David Moyes believes Jarrod Bowen is pushing for an England call and there have certainly been worse ideas. Norwich could not get near the forward here; he was on a mission to score from the outset and, while goals towards the end of each half were sufficient, he could have added several more. A third straight win consigns West Ham’s December wobble to history and returns them to fourth place for now but their opponents, whose uptick under Dean Smith is a yet more remote memory, show no sign of a meaningful fight against relegation.  Smith knew Norwich, hurtling towards the last-chance saloon after emerging from their last five league games goalless and pointless, needed to try something different so began with Adam Idah alongside Teemu Pukki in attack. The attack-minded Milot Rashica and Przemyslaw Placheta were deployed out wide; it smacked of acknowledgement that wins must arrive immediately but the risk of exposure in their own half was clear. The point was proved within two minutes when Bowen, found by a cute Manuel Lanzini pass, shot firmly but straight at Tim Krul. It was a decent chance and smart work from Lanzini, who started alongside Declan Rice in a deeper role after Tomas Soucek tested positive for Covid-19. He received a sight of his own, lifting over from 20 yards, before briefly causing his own side alarm on the quarter-hour when requiring treatment for a knock. By then Norwich had subjected West Ham’s back line, which included a newly fit Aaron Cresswell after six weeks out, to some light examination. Idah offered encouragement with a couple of bursts but they remained vulnerable to Bowen’s darts inside from the right. The hosts controlled play without mustering the intensity, at that point, to suggest a breakthrough was close. They were denied a chance to find it in the 24th minute, though, when Tim Krul ended up inside his own net as he grappled with Nikola Vlasic at a corner. Play continued and, when the ball went dead, Krul was quick to direct his anger at the referee Simon Hooper. Krul had actually appeared more sinner than sinned against: Vlasic had been blocking him but the keeper clearly hauled him down by the neck. Penalties have been awarded for far less. It mattered little. West Ham’s pressure ramped up and their lead, when it came, was deserved. Bowen had seen a goal disallowed when his cross sailed beyond Krul only for an offside Vlasic to correctly be deemed interfering; back he came, though, and the one that counted was deftly taken. Vladimir Coufal retrieved an overhit Cresswell cross and delivered delicately for Bowen to glance home, receiving the reward he had threatened since the start. As is customary, Norwich had been breached all too easily. Vlasic sought a spot-kick again shortly after the restart when Max Aarons appeared to tug his shorts as the winger dashed past. Nothing was given but West Ham had begun the second half as they ended the first, Michail Antonio turning Grant Hanley six yards out before blasting over and beating the ground in frustration. Pablo Fornals had created that chance and, in the 57th minute, he sent Bowen clear. Bowen clipped over Krul but struck the top of the bar; five minutes later he hit the base of a post from an angle and, as the minutes ticked away, Norwich were somehow still in the game. They almost levelled from nowhere when Idah danced inside before thudding a strike that Lukasz Fabianski tipped onto his right-hand post. It was their one chance. Bowen then flicked in Arthur Masuaku’s low centre, the goal awarded after a VAR check, to push his England claim further.",Sport/Football,West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen strikes twice to extend Norwich misery at the bottom,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/12/west-ham-norwich-premier-league-match-report

1/13/2022,"Hospitals in Greater Manchester have called for urgent military support as the region’s NHS creaks under pressure from the Omicron variant. Soldiers could be asked to carry out basic care needs, such as hydration and nutrition, for patients in so-called super-surge beds, as well as ancillary support including porter work, admin tasks and cleaning.  It comes as the rising demand for hospitals in the region surpasses last year’s peak, with staff absences across all areas on the increase too. The highly transmissible Omicron variant has seen mini-Nightingale-style wards open at a number of NHS hospitals in Greater Manchester, with the Royal Oldham understood to be facing significant pressure. Chris Brookes, acute lead for Greater Manchester and an A&E consultant at Salford Royal, told the Manchester Evening News (MEN) that the system has been holding together so far, but “it would be wrong for me to say it’s not more intense a pressure, because it is”. He added: “The word I’d use is uncomfortable. When bed occupancy is in the low- to mid-90%, that is an uncomfortable place.” Senior NHS bosses are now in urgent talks with the military about the forces providing extra support across the region’s hospitals, as it has done in other parts of the country already. Brookes said: “Where there has been much active conversation with the military is with respect to the support they can give to our ancillary services. “Our portering staff are not immune from all of this, our cleaning staff are not immune to all of it, our admin staff, all those colleagues who are performing incredibly important functions. “That’s the place the military are looking to be able to support us, or where they may have skills in terms of pharmacy and pharmacy technicians. “So that’s where conversations are happening with the military and I think that’s a good thing, to minimise the impact of staffing absence.” Non-urgent surgery has been cancelled almost across the board to help make staff available to assist with rising Covid cases being admitted into hospital wards. A senior clinician observed that the weekend of the New Year and the first week of January were “particularly tough” but that staff had been prepared. They told the MEN: “I think the NHS has responded incredibly well, but we were bracing ourselves for this … we’ve not been overwhelmed but, yet again, we’ve had to ask them to go above and beyond.” The armed forces were deployed earlier this month to help hospitals in London deal with a surge in Covid patients and the number of staff off sick and unable to work. Of the 200 military personnel involved, 40 were doctors, while the other 160 personnel, who have no medical training, were deployed to check in patients, ensure stocks are maintained and “conduct basic checks”, according to the Ministry of Defence. They are expected to support the NHS in the capital until the end of the month.",News/UK news,Hospitals in Greater Manchester call for military aid over Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/hospitals-in-greater-manchester-call-for-military-aid-over-omicron-surge
