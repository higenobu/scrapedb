1/11/2022,"The loved ones of a Bank of America executive who was found beaten to death inside her home are pressing for special circumstance charges to be filed against her alleged killer as Los Angeles County's top prosecutor faces criticism and a recall effort over his progressive policies. Michelle Avan, 48, had recently been promoted to a senior vice president position when she was killed by her former boyfriend, a colleague, Anthony Turner, authorities said. She was found Aug. 5, 2021, inside her home in Los Angeles' Reseda neighborhood. Avan's loved ones are frustrated with District Attorney George Gascon's office for not filing special circumstances charges against Turner, saying he could be possibly be freed on parole after 10 years if convicted. LAPD OFFICERS PULL PILOT FROM PLANE SECONDS BEFORE TRAIN CRASH IN DRAMATIC VIDEO ""He's eligible for anything that a murderer should not be eligible for,"" Avan's brother, Patrick Miller, told Fox News. Turner is charged with murder and first-degree burglary. He was released on bond days after his arrest. Fox News has reached out to Gascon's office. Avan's loved ones plan to rally Thursday in front of the DA's office to pressure him to file stronger charges. Authorities said Turner entered Avan's home on Aug. 3 and killed her before leaving the next day. Her body was discovered by her son, Trevon Avan. Gascon has faced criticism since taking office in December 2020 over his controversial directives that include not seeking bond for some criminal suspects, refusing to prosecute certain crimes and not seeking sentencing enhancements for others. Opponents are in the midst of a second recall effort against the progressive prosecutor whose efforts to re-imagine how crimes are dealt with in California's most populated county has drawn the ire of fellow district attorneys, law enforcement officials and tough-on-crime advocates. An earlier recall effort failed to garner enough signatures from registered voters. Recall supporters have said crime has risen since Gascon took office, though crime began seeing an uptick in the months before he was elected as well as in other cities across the country. The one criticism they all voice is that Gascon, a former San Francisco district attorney and assistant chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, has abandoned crime victims in favor of protecting the rights of criminals. Desiree Andrade, whose son Julien was murdered in 2018, is part of the committee leading the recall effort against him. ""In my son's case, they were all facing special circumstances… and those are being dismissed. They were all facing the death penalty or life without parole and now they're only facing 25 years with the possibility of parole,"" she told Fox News. ""To me, that's a slap in the face. So I can see how the Avan family is upset about this. There are no consequences anymore."" Some of Gascon's own prosecutors have also publicly come out against his policies. ""George Gascón says ‘facts matter.’ They do,"" Jonathan Hatami tweeted Monday. ""Homicides & shootings are at a 15-yr high in LA. Releasing criminals on $0 bond, defunding the police, refusing to prosecute crimes, issuing blanket policies, & failing to hold people accountable are not reforms & only lead to violence."" The Avan family is hoping that prosecutors will levy the most serious charges in Turner's case, but they aren't optimistic. ""I don't believe his policies are for the people he was voted to serve,"" Miller said, adding that he believes Gascon's directives are politically-driven. ""We expect justice when something happens. He puts you in a position to make justice seem as not the norm.""",U.S./Fox News,Family of Los Angeles banking executive beaten to death demand more serious charges from progressive DA,https://news.yahoo.com/family-los-angeles-banking-executive-022519836.html
1/11/2022,"A Korean American woman reportedly fell victim to an anti-Asian incident in New York City that was not investigated as a hate crime for months until a recent panel recommendation.

The incident, which was caught on video and posted on Twitter, occurred on the A Train between 34th and 42nd Streets on Oct. 5, 2021, according to ABC7 News reporter CeFaan Kim.

In the video, a man can be seen standing up from his seat and approaching the camera to make lewd gestures and remarks.

“You’re a f*cking bum… Kiss my ass! Kiss my ass! Kiss my ass!” yelled the man, who was wearing a red hoodie and ripped jeans. “F*ck you!” He continued, “Who wants to touch you, you miserable f*cking carrier!”

The video ends with the man spitting twice in front of the camera.

Kim reported that detectives have refused to include the man’s mention of “carrier” in the report, while the city’s Hate Crimes Task Force told the victim that the incident was not a hate crime.

In a tweet, the “appalled” victim claimed that the matter was not pursued as a hate crime “because the perp didn’t call me ‘Asian carrier.’”
 
 None. He said he would not amend my report even though I wrote it in my personal statement. He said that because the perp didn’t call me “Asian carrier” (the use of the word “Asian”) it was not a hate crime. I was appalled.

Kim later took to Twitter to report that the incident is now being investigated as a hate crime upon the recommendation of a civilian hate crime review panel.

1/11/2022,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Two Oklahoma death row inmates facing executions in the coming months offered firing squad as a less problematic alternative to the state's three-drug lethal injection, one of their attorneys told a federal judge on Monday. The two inmates — Donald Grant and Gilbert Postelle — want U.S. District Judge Stephen Friot to grant them a temporary injunction that would delay their upcoming executions until a trial can be held over whether Oklahoma's three-drug lethal injection method is constitutional. A trial is set to begin before Friot on Feb. 28, but Grant is scheduled to be put to death on Jan. 27, while Postelle is set for execution on Feb. 17. “While it may be gruesome to look at, we all agree it will be quicker,"" attorney Jim Stronski told Friot after a day-long hearing in Oklahoma City. Friot did not issue a decision Monday on the inmates' motion, but said he hoped to release an order by the end of the week. “There's a lot for me to get my mind around,"" Friot said. Among the experts who testified was Dr. James Williams, an emergency medicine specialist from Texas who has more than 40,000 hours of emergency room experience and who has extensively studied the use of firing squads. Williams, himself the victim of a gunshot wound to the chest area, testified that a firing squad involving shots from at least four high-powered rifles to the “cardiac bundle"" of the heart would be so quick that an inmate wouldn't feel pain. He also said that unlike lethal injection, there is an extremely low likelihood that the execution would be botched. Oklahoma has never used firing squad as a method of executing prisoners since statehood, but current state law does allow for its use if other methods, like lethal injection, were determined to be unconstitutional or otherwise unavailable. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections does not currently have execution protocols in place for any method other than lethal injection. Friot also heard testimony from Justin Farris, chief of operations at the Department of Corrections, about the recent lethal injections of death row inmates John Marion Grant and Bigler Stouffer late last year. Farris, who was inside the death chamber for both executions, described the two lethal injections as being on “opposite ends of the spectrum."" Grant, who was declared dead after vomiting and convulsing on the gurney, was angry, hurling expletives and resisting the execution by trying to flex his arms and legs, Farris said. Stouffer, on the other hand, “was just as polite as you can imagine under the circumstances,"" Farris said. Farris also testified that the doctor who inserts the intravenous lines and helps oversee the lethal injections is paid $15,000 for each execution he attends, as well as $1,000 for every day of training. DOC policy prohibits the release of the names of execution team members, and the doctor wore a mask during both Grant's and Stouffer's executions.",U.S./Associated Press,Oklahoma death row inmates seek firing squad as alternative,https://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-death-row-inmates-seek-023448271.html
