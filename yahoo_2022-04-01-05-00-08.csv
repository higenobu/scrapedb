4/1/2022,"Russia’s Vladimir Putin is calling up another 134,500 conscripts even as more and more of his own soldiers appear to be turning on him over humiliating losses in Ukraine. According to a decree published on a Russian government portal Thursday, the troops will be called to begin service on April 1 until July 15. The Defense Ministry promised earlier this week that they “will not be sent to any hot spots,” and that all those called up in last spring’s draft will be sent home. But those assurances seem likely to be overshadowed by a multitude of reports that say Russia’s senseless war against Ukraine has been marred by lies from the top down, with Russian troops claiming they were misled into the war and Putin’s own advisers said to be shielding him from the extent of the devastating losses. Even as Putin signed the decree on Thursday, Ukraine’s Security Service released an intercepted call said to capture a Russian soldier railing against the incompetence of his own army. “Our brigade has totally shit themselves. There are losses, many wounded,” he tells his wife. Asked if the losses are a result of someone screwing up, he offers a blunt response: “The whole army with us is stupid morons.” “It’s unclear why we are even here,” he says. Another recording shared by Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, captures a man identified as a Russian soldier named Maksim asking his mother what is being shown on Russian television, and if there are reports “they’re saying they will change anything.” “Everything’s bad, almost no one among us is left. They said we will keep going until the very end, until everyone is killed,” he tells his mother. Asked if his senior officer was still with the unit, he replies: “No, he dumped us yesterday. We’re all dead in the water if he left.” We Are Falling Into Putin’s Evil Little Trap Again The new recordings come just hours after Western officials said there was growing evidence of disarray and disillusionment among Russian troops, with Britain’s spy chief citing reports of troops “refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft.” Reporting by Meduza on Thursday largely aligned with Western assessments. Citing three sources close to the presidential administration, the news outlet reported that Russian military officials finally came to terms with the fact that they wouldn’t be able to seize control of Kyiv by late March. (Just a month earlier, according to Meduza, they were all but certain that the “special operation” would be quick, and the biggest headache would be organizing work by the “new administrations” put in place by Russia). But they decided to shift their focus to the Donbas in the country’s east after realizing the full scale of military setbacks—and the damage wrought on the economy by Western sanctions. Putin was personally presented with the reality of the sanctions only at the end of March, when officials showed him “the country will not be able to live normally under such sanctions,” one source was quoted telling Meduza. The Russian leader has still not made a final decision on what he’s going to do next, and plenty of those close to him are reportedly pressuring him to go full steam ahead with the onslaught against Ukraine. But the presidential administration is said to be concerned about how “a possible truce with Ukraine will hit Putin’s [approval] ratings.” “The citizens were riled up by propaganda. Suppose a decision is made to stop at the territory of the Donbas. What about the Nazis then? Are we no longer fighting them? This word has been hammered into people so much that I can’t imagine how one can stop in Donbas without losing approval ratings,” one source told Meduza. Perhaps as part of a long game, the Kremlin has now reportedly begun implementing plans to send psychologists from the FSB into Kherson, a city in the south of Ukraine where residents continue to resist the Russian forces who took over after the Feb. 24 invasion. “To implement a scenario for the creation of another pseudo-republic in the territory of the Kherson region, there is work underway by employees of the FSB, 652 groups of information and psychological operations and officers of the 12th Main Directorate of the [Russian] General Staff,” the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said in a statement Thursday. Ukrainian officials said the FSB effort is an attempt to brainwash residents into supporting their new Russian authorities. Russian law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges are also said to be on their way to occupied territories in Ukraine, with reports of Russian police officers being asked to take “business trips” to parts of the Donbas in Ukraine’s east.

4/1/2022,"The paternity lawsuit against Dallas Cowboy’s owner Jerry Jones has been unsealed and outlines accusations by Alexandra Davis that Jones is her biological father and has tried to keep her quiet about it. The case is set for a non-jury trial on Nov. 7, according to a court order scheduling the trial. The lawsuit seeks an advisory opinion saying that Davis is not bound by a deal Davis’ lawyers say her mother signed for financial support in exchange for a promise to never disclose Jones. The agreement, the lawsuit claims, requires Davis and her mother to never reveal that Jones is her father. Davis, a 25-year-old aide to U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Amarillo), says she has only ever revealed Jones as her father during an FBI security clearance check to work in former President Donald Trump’s White House, saying she was under oath during an interview with the FBI and had not choice but to identify Jones. “On all forms during her life that have required her to identify her father she has consistently and sadly written, ‘N/A,’ “ the lawsuit claims. The lawsuit mentions health concerns for Davis’ mother and says that she has feared losing financial support from Jones if she ever told anybody who her father is. Jones’ lawyers claim in a legal response submitted to the court that all the allegations in the lawsuit are false and that the court does not have the power to release Davis from the settlement because it doesn’t exist. His attorneys demanded “strict proof” of every one of Davis’ claims. His attorneys say in the legal response that the lawsuit “is submersed in hypothetical and contingent scenarios that are not justiciable because they have not occurred.” Jones’ attorneys say in their legal response that Davis “delivered a draft of her lawsuit to Defendant [Jones] and, to borrow her phrase, asked whether he would like to ‘make a deal’ to ‘assure that he would not be publicly or privately identified and/or declared as Plaintiff’s father.’ “ His attorneys say in the response the lawsuit was filed when Jones said he wouldn’t pay and that Davis “is not entitled to the relief she requests, and the court does not have jurisdiction to grant it.” Jones’ lawyers said the lawsuit was filed after Davis attempted to extort money from the Cowboys owner. Alexandra Davis says in the lawsuit she was born after her mother, Cynthia Davis Spencer, had an affair with Jones while working for American Airlines at the airport in Little Rock, Arkansas. Spencer was “pursued romantically” by Jones and had a relationship, Davis claims in the lawsuit. During divorce proceedings, Spencer’s then-husband had a court-ordered paternity test conducted and found that Davis was not his biological child. In 1998 when the divorce was finalized, it included a finding that Spencer’s ex-husband was not Davis’ biological or legal father, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit claims that as soon as Spencer found out that her ex-husband was not Davis’ father, she told Jones he was the father. Jones told her he was “not biologically capable of impregnating a female,” according to the suit. Spencer and Jones negotiated a settlement, which the lawsuit describes as “hush money,” in which Jones agreed to pay about $27,000 to Spencer to resolve the divorce. Another $30,000 was paid to continue negotiations in “good faith.” When the settlement was finalized, Jones agreed to pay a lump sum of $375,000 for confidentiality and set up two trusts funded by Jones for Alexandra Davis, according to the lawsuit. Davis would receive “certain monthly, annual and special funding” from the trusts until she turned 21, after which she would receive annual lump sums at 24, 26 and 28 years old, according to the suit. The suit says the trust was established under the name of Jones’ attorney and friend, Donald Jack, to hide Jones’ identity. The settlement included a requirement that then-1-year-old Davis and her mother never claim or mention that Jones was Davis’ father and prohibited both Spencer and Davis from suing Jones under the threat that the money would be cut off. “The primary purpose of the arrangement was designed for Defendant Jones to maintain leverage and intimidation over Cynthia [Davis Spencer] to not only not disclose his identity, but to compel Cynthia to train Plaintiff from ever disclosing and/or identifying who her father was,” Davis’ attorneys wrote in the lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks to end the requirement for Davis to keep quiet about the identity of her father. Specifically, Davis’ attorneys are asking the court to void a paragraph in the agreement that says if Spencer, Davis “or any person on behalf of child,” tries to initiate a legal proceeding to establish Jones as Davis’ parent he can, “in his sole discretion,” end the agreement and any financial support or payments. The suit argues the law does not allow Spencer to make this agreement for silence on the behalf of then-1-year-old Davis. She wants the court to declare she is not bound by this provision. Davis also claims in the suit that she and Jones have never met. Davis’ attorneys told ESPN in a statement March 10 that she isn’t looking for “fame or fortune.”  “Surely, anyone can understand this need of a child no matter what age to have the ability to say they have a father without the fear of reprisal,” Andrew Bergman and Jay K. Gray told ESPN in the joint statement. Her attorneys said in the lawsuit that Jones’ only role in Davis’ life has been to “shun” and “coerce her from ever disclosing her identity.” “To add incredible insult to injury, Plaintiff has had to spend her entire life hiding and concealing who her real father is,” the lawsuit says. Jones’ attorneys dispute in his response submitted to the court the claim that Davis isn’t looking for money and accuse her of attempting to extort Jones. The response says the alleged extortion attempts “will be the subject of other litigation which has been filed or will be instituted shortly.” “Plaintiff’s ‘let’s make a deal’ overtures were made at the same time Defendant and the Dallas Cowboys were targets of multiple monetary extortion attempts,” the response says. The lawsuit says that Davis has “had to endure the endless public profiles of her father and siblings while forced to remain secret to everyone, including her closest confidants.” The lawsuit does not say when or how Davis learned Jones is her father.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Paternity lawsuit against Jerry Jones unsealed after Dallas Cowboys owner fires back,https://news.yahoo.com/paternity-lawsuit-against-jerry-jones-014843978.html

4/1/2022,"Vladimir Putin “massively misjudged the situation” in ordering the invasion of Ukraine and surely knows just how poorly things are going for Russian forces even though his closest advisers are hiding the truth from him, according to the head of Britain’s spy services. In a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra on Thursday morning, GCHQ director Sir Jeremy Fleming said the Russian leader’s “unprovoked and premeditated attack on Ukraine” has been “shocking in every sense of the word.” He also said Putin, a former KGB officer, was caught completely flat-footed by what he found. “It’s clear he misjudged the resistance of the Ukrainian people,” Fleming said. “He underestimated the strength of the coalition his actions would galvanize. He underplayed the economic consequences of the sanctions regime. He overestimated the abilities of his military to secure a rapid victory. We’ve seen Russian soldiers—short of weapons and morale—refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft.” ‘It’s a Sh*tshow’: Russian Troops Are Now Turning on Each Other Throughout the past 36 days, Putin has consistently been misled by top Russian military and intelligence officials about the army’s progress in Ukraine, declassified U.S. intelligence has reportedly shown. During a stop in Algiers on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Putin’s inner circle is not telling him the truth about the war and the true bite of economic sanctions on Russia’s economy. An unnamed senior U.S. intelligence official told the Associated Press that Putin’s advisers are “scared” to give him an accurate version of events, and that those deceiving him include Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. However, Fleming said on Thursday, “what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.” “The great irony is, of course, that through his actions, Putin has brought upon himself exactly what he was trying to avoid—a Ukraine with a renewed sense of nationhood, a NATO that is more united than ever, and a global coalition of nations that condemn his actions,” Fleming told the audience. Because the invasion is only about a month old, it is “far too early to confidently draw out all the implications of this crisis,” said Fleming. But he discussed some notable aspects of Putin’s war that have so far stood out to him. For starters, Russia’s disinformation game is strong. “Their aim is to promulgate disinformation,” Fleming continued. “To sow mistrust in the evidence and to amplify false narratives. It’s also to make sure that the real picture of what’s going on doesn’t get exposed inside Russia… We know Putin’s campaign is beset by problems—low morale, logistical failures and high Russian casualty numbers. Their command and control is in chaos. We’ve seen Putin lie to his own people in an attempt to hide military incompetence. And all of that means, he seeks brutal control of the media and access to the internet, he seeks the closing down of opposition voices, and he’s making heavy investment in their propaganda and covert agencies.” Again, Putin badly misjudged Ukraine’s fierce resistance, Fleming went on. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has become a global beacon of democracy, with support from governments and Bono alike. Businesses worldwide have pulled their operations out of Russia due to the invasion, and tech firms have rushed to help Ukraine stay connected to the outside world. At the same time, Russia is padding out its ranks with foreign fighters and mercenaries from private contractors like the Wagner Group, which is closely linked to Putin confidant Yevgeny Prigozhin. Insiders Warn Notorious Foreign Rebels to Fight With Russia in Ukraine “They are looking at relocating forces from other conflicts and recruiting new fighters to bolster numbers,” Fleming said in his speech. “These soldiers are likely to be used as cannon fodder to try to limit Russian military losses.” Russia has long been hostile toward NATO, ​​viewing the allied coalition as an existential threat. And yet the invasion of Ukraine has “certainly galvanized” NATO members as well as non-members such as Japan and Australia which have been “leaning in,” in Fleming’s words. “It’s also showing, in stark relief, those countries that choose to either support Putin or abstain from making a choice,” he said. “And those choices will affect the global order and our national securities for decades to come.” Putin, for now, is sticking to his plan for better or worse, according to Fleming, who described it as mostly worse. Now the fear is that Russia shifts to Putin’s “Plan B,” which Fleming warned will be “more barbarity against civilians and cities.” “Clearly, he plays by different moral and legal rules,” he said. “Far too many Ukrainians and Russians have already lost their lives. And beyond this toll, many, many more have had their lives shattered. The UN estimate that in just over a month, more than 10 million people have already fled their homes. It’s a humanitarian crisis that need never have happened. And it’s not over yet.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.
