1/19/2022,"Burberry is forecasting that full-year profits will grow 35% compared with last year, as strong sales of its luxury clothing and bags in Asia and the US drive its trading rebound from the pandemic. The British luxury brand said full price sales were up 26% compared with pre-pandemic levels in the three months to 25 December and 10% growth in the previous quarter, as it sold more full-price items including Burberry trainers, raincoats and bags.  The company said it now expected to increase full year profits by 35% year on year to about £500m, up from City analysts’ previous expectation of just over £470m. Burberry credited the strong profits growth to designer Riccardo Tisci’s products attracting younger shoppers. Sales in Asia rose by 22% on two years ago in the quarter, accelerating from 5% in the prior three months amid strong sales of coats, puffer jackets and different versions of its Lola bag. In Europe sales were down 4% on two years ago with low numbers of tourists who accounted for 40% of Burberry’s sales before the pandemic. But the drop was a dramatic improvement on the 27% dive in the previous quarter as chief operating officer Julie Brown said Burberry’s new image was proving attractive to more local shoppers. Gerry Murphy, the chair of Burberry said: “Despite the ongoing challenges of the external environment, we are confident of finishing the year strongly and providing an excellent platform on which to build when our new chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd joins in April.” Burberry is in the process of switching management, after it poached Akeyroyd from Versace to take over as chief executive from Marco Gobbetti, who was part way through a turnaround plan aimed at taking Burberry further upmarket, with prices to rival its French and Italian rivals. Gobbetti will step down at the end of the year, after saying he wanted to return home to Italy. Gobbetti brought Tisci to Burberry in 2018, having previously hired him at the luxury brand Givenchy.",News/Business,Burberry predicts 35% rise in annual profits backed by Asia sales,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/burberry-predicts-35-rise-in-annual-profits-backed-by-asia-sales
1/19/2022,"Should noisy people be tolerated, celebrated or stifled? And are loud women particularly objectionable? Dr Annette Plaut was sacked from her post in the physics department of the University of Exeter after 29 years, and claims that the combination of her being “female and loud” led to her losing her job. She has just been awarded £101,000 for unfair dismissal. The university and the human resources department could not tolerate her volume, she said, because it “contradicts their stereotypical assumptions of how a woman should behave”. Clearly there is more to this case than simply volume. You don’t suddenly notice overnight that your colleague has the voice of Thor, God of Thunder, after 29 years, and the university argued during the tribunal that she was dismissed for the way she dealt with two PhD students. But the “loud” argument reveals something interesting. One person’s “valued” colleague – as Plaut was described – is another’s definition of “boisterous” and “overbearing”, as she was also called. Her reaction to the tribunal outcome? “I have a naturally loud voice. As such I have no ability to sense when I am speaking loudly.” The University of Exeter has said it will appeal against the decision.  Is it really possible to be so unaware of how you come across? A few years ago a (male) friend and I were having drinks in a bar and gossiping, inconspicuously. Or so we thought. The bar was pretty empty but we could see a few other people were around so we kept our voices down. If you had asked me to describe how we were speaking, I would have said in something close to stage whispers. As the bell rang for last orders, a woman came over to our table with a face of thunder. “I just want you to know that you have ruined our evening with your booming voices. Not everyone wants to hear what you have to say at top volume.” Oh dear. We genuinely had no idea. So I get the defence of “no ability to sense when speaking loudly”. I dread to think of how ear-splitting we would have been were we not being our version of “discreet”. There’s a whole school of thought about why some of us speak more forcibly than others, some of it sympathetic, a lot of it not. In defence of the deafening, any number of innocent factors can play a role. Growing up in a voluble family. Overcompensating for shyness or anxiety. Momentary lapses of self-awareness, sometimes alcohol induced. Or a physical reason of some kind, from undiagnosed hearing loss to excessively hearty vocal muscles honed via rampant karaoke (guilty). In Plaut’s case, she argued that her way of speaking came from her “family background” and “is a perfectly normal and acceptable way to speak among people of middle and eastern European Jewish background”. She added that she had lived and worked for years in places such as New York and Germany where the volume of her voice passed unnoticed. It was only in genteel Exeter that people started to question things. As this case demonstrates, tolerance of the loud has a cultural dimension, or is at least influenced by context and surroundings. We stereotypically expect librarians and nurses to talk quietly. Teachers, politicians, thespians and “Americans” (especially New Yorkers) are generally allowed to be bombastic. There is something about loudness that is about more than volume. It’s not just a way of taking up space and attention. It’s a way of being brazen and unashamed. Who do they think they are, making all that noise? What makes them so special? To tell someone to pipe down is to remind them of their place. This is exactly what Plaut was getting at when she referenced being “loud and female”. There are two ideas at play here: “I don’t realise when I’m being ‘loud’.” And: “Why should I speak more softly to make you feel comfortable?” That night at the bar, my friend and I cringed. We hadn’t meant to ruin anyone’s evening. And we certainly weren’t about to start an argument about the level of decibels we had or hadn’t produced. Despite the fact that we were mystified, we apologised profusely, in the most dulcet tones we could manage. Which probably sounded like Brian Blessed giving a hurricane warning. This is the trouble, you see. Loudness, like beauty, is entirely subjective. It’s in the ear of the beholder. And some beholders are a lot more tolerant than others. Viv Groskop is a writer and the host of the podcast How to Own the Room: Women and the Art of Brilliant Speaking",Opinion/Opinion,Being loud and female is about more than volume – it’s about being unashamed | Viv Groskop,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/loud-female-volume-unashamed-annette-plaut
1/19/2022,"Jay-Z, Meek Mill, Kelly Rowland and Killer Mike are among the star names arguing for a change in New York law that would prevent rap lyrics being used as evidence in criminal trials. The vocalists, joined by Fat Joe, Yo Gotti, Robin Thicke and more, have signed a letter urging lawmakers in New York state to back the proposed change and uphold freedom of expression.  The legislation, titled Rap Music on Trial, was first proposed in November by state senators Brad Hoylman and Jamaal Bailey, to prevent prosecutors from citing lyrics except in cases of “clear and convincing proof” of a link between lyrics and a crime. “The right to free speech is enshrined in our federal and state constitutions,” Bailey said at the time. “The admission of art as criminal evidence only serves to erode this fundamental right, and the use of rap and hip-hop lyrics in particular is emblematic of the systemic racism that permeates our criminal justice system.” The legislation passed an initial stage in the state senate earlier this week. “This is a long time coming,” said Alex Spiro, Jay-Z’s lawyer, who drafted the letter. Speaking to Rolling Stone, he said: “By changing the law here, you do a lot of good for the cases that it affects, but you also send a message that progress is coming. We expect it will be followed in a lot of places.” In 2019, prosecutors in a case featuring rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine said they intended to include lyrics and music that “provide context” and “pertain to certain disputes”. The rapper was also questioned about lyrics to his hit Gummo while in court. During the murder trial of late rapper Drakeo the Ruler, who was acquitted in 2019, prosecutors included lyrics from his track Flex Freestyle during proceedings in an attempt to appoint guilt. The rapper Tay-K had a 2017 US hit with The Race before being convicted for murder – and both the song and its video were used by prosecutors during his trial. The practice is used in the UK, too. Prosecutors in a murder case against drill rapper Unknown T attempted to introduce his lyrics as evidence, though this was blocked by a judge, and the rapper was acquitted in 2020. Drill rapper Digga D, who has had nine Top 40 hits, was given a criminal behaviour order in 2018, the terms of which prevent him from using certain names, locations and themes in his lyrics. In a study of 30 appeal judgments between 2005 and 2020, London School of Economics law professor Abenaa Owusu-Bempah found that “prosecutors can use lyrics and videos to tell a story of a dangerous rapper that reflects longstanding stereotypes about Black males as criminals”. She said that “rap music is usually presented in court as ‘bad character evidence’,” but had also been used as direct evidence.",Arts/Music,Stars including Jay-Z call for end to use of rap lyrics as criminal evidence,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/19/stars-including-jay-z-call-for-end-to-use-of-rap-lyrics-as-criminal-evidence
1/19/2022,"The UK defence minister, James Heappey, has urged his colleagues to wait for Sue Gray’s report before submitting letters of no confidence in the prime minister, calling for “cool heads”, as Boris Johnson battles for his political future. Johnson will face the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday for the first time since No 10 was forced to apologise to the Queen over two parties held the night before Prince Philip’s funeral.  Heappey conceded that Johnson had appeared under pressure in a Sky News interview on Tuesday. “He looked like the man who has the weight of the world on his shoulders,” he said. The minister acknowledged the intensity of public anger, saying he had had “hundreds of emails” from constituents, and expected the prime minister to have to make further apologies. “People are absolutely furious at what they have heard and seen.” But Heappey called on Conservative MPs to await the findings of Gray, who is the heading the investigation into alleged rule-breaking at Downing Street, before moving against Johnson. “I wish that they would wait. This feels like a time for cool heads in parliament,” he said. “I think we should all be wanting to wait to see what evidence she has gathered from across everybody she has spoken to and what judgments she comes to and then we can make a decision about what happens next.” Conservative MPs can trigger a leadership contest if 15% of them – 54 on current numbers in parliament – write a confidential letter of no confidence in the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, the parliamentary group of the Conservative party in the House of Commons. Only he knows the exact number of letters that have been submitted.  Once the threshold is reached, there is a vote of confidence in the party leader, involving all Conservative MPs. If the prime minister wins a majority – in this case 180 votes – he would remain in office, and no new no-confidence vote could be triggered for at least 12 months. If he loses, or choses to resign, then a leadership contest takes place. In a leadership election, Conservative MPs choose one candidate from those standing in a secret ballot. In the first round, any candidate who wins the support of fewer than 5% of MPs is eliminated. In the second round anybody winning less than 10% of the vote is eliminated. In subsequent rounds the bottom placed contender drops out until there are only two contenders left. The choice of those two is then put to a postal ballot of Conservative party members around the country. The winner of that vote becomes the prime minister, with no obligation to call a general election to secure their position. He said he trusted the prime minister’s explanation, given last week, that he had believed the “bring your own booze” gathering he attended on 20 May 2020 was a “work event”. “I can see how the prime minister wouldn’t have known what it was he was going down the stairs to join. His diary is extraordinarily congested, put together in five-minute blocks, and he spends his day bouncing from high-level meeting to high-level meeting,” he said. If 54 letters are received from Conservative MPs by the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, he would call a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. If Johnson lost it, his premiership would then be over. Red wall Conservative MPs met on Tuesday to decide whether to put in their letters. They gathered in the office of the Rutland and Melton MP Alicia Kearns, giving rise to the nickname the “pork pie plot”, with 10 or so believed to have sent in letters, and more waiting until Wednesday. Heappey appeared to agree that Johnson would have to resign if the facts laid out in the Gray report suggest he lied to parliament. “All of us are very clear on what signing the ministerial code means and you heard my colleagues the lord chancellor and the chancellor both reflect on that yesterday,” he said. Johnson is expected to update parliament on plans for lifting Covid restrictions, as No 10 battles to shift the focus away from more than a dozen lockdown-busting parties, on to the government’s political agenda.",News/Politics,Minister urges Tory ‘cool heads’ on Boris Johnson no confidence,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/minister-urges-tory-cool-heads-on-boris-johnson-no-confidence
1/19/2022,"Director Denzel Washington and his stars do their best with this bland, shallow and awkwardly structured film. It’s a romantic drama based on the bestselling 2008 memoir from publisher and former New York Times reporter Dana Canedy, about the journal that her soldier husband Charles Monroe King wrote for their infant son Jordan just before Charles’s death in Iraq – telling Jordan how to respect women, himself and his country. Chanté Adams plays Canedy, a young New York journalist in the 90s who falls hard for Charles (Michael B Jordan): a sweet, idealistic guy in the US army who has no desire for her to abandon her career for him. So they are apart a lot when he is training, and then, tragically, seeing action in the Middle East. The narrative jolts episodically back and forth between the early days of their relationship, their happiness living together and her grim and lonely widowhood and single-motherhood in which she has some supportive female friends and the regulation Gay Male Friend (very similar to the one in The Devil Wears Prada). There is a particularly jarring moment when Dana reacts to the breaking story of 9/11 in the New York Times newsroom and then, before she or we have absorbed the horror of that, the story unsatisfyingly shifts to her life much later, an entirely different situation.  The awful truth about how Charles actually met his end is of course saved for the end, but he actually had a first wife and daughter (that is, Jordan’s half-sister) whom we never see on screen. Apart from one or two mentions they are bafflingly – and heartlessly – excluded from the story. Dana’s own professional situation isn’t great: we see two smug male journalists undermining her at work, taking her story away from her, using her single-motherhood against her. How did that situation pan out? We aren’t told. And the all-important journal itself is not very interesting or powerful. There doesn’t have to be a Nicholas Sparks-type twist, but the document itself needed to have some impact. A disappointment.  A Journal for Jordan is released on 21 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,A Journal for Jordan review – bland military romance scuppers Denzel Washington,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/a-journal-for-jordan-review-denzel-washington-michael-b-jordan
1/19/2022,"Almost two years after working in a temporary Covid intensive care unit at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Kim Bishop, a critical care nurse, can still remember which patients were in which rooms. “When you walk back on these units, you know which patient survived in which room and which ones didn’t,” said Bishop, who still works at the Philadelphia hospital and moves among different units. “I thought we closed that chapter once we closed that unit, but now walking back into it, it’s almost like a slap in the face.”  Bishop’s feelings are not unique among providers who treat Covid patients in the US. Many are leaving the field. Recent research indicates that healthcare workers and first responders are displaying post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms like veterans who served in combat. Healthcare providers and researchers now say that if hospitals continue to be overwhelmed with patients who have not been vaccinated against the virus and administrators don’t find a way to provide relief to medical staff, many will leave areas where they care for Covid patients – or exit healthcare altogether. That would worsen staffing shortages and further strain hospitals’ capacity to provide necessary care. “It’s important to take care of and think of healthcare workers because they matter as people, and also it has really significant implications for our healthcare system,” said Dr Rebecca Hendrickson, a VA Puget Sound Health Care System clinical psychiatrist and lead researcher of a new study on healthcare workers. “You actually can’t protect your healthcare system without protecting the workers.” The Journal of General Internal Medicine study published in December surveyed more than 500 doctors, nurses and first responders and found that 15% said it was “not at all likely” they would still work in the field in five to 10 years. Among nurses, the figure was 20%. That’s largely because of the deterioration of healthcare providers’ mental health. Seventy-four per cent of respondents reported symptoms of depression; 37% reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder; and 15% reported thoughts of suicide or self-harm. A significant contributor to their recent distress, Hendrickson said, was the duration of the pandemic. Earlier in the pandemic, workers knew they were facing a real risk of becoming ill but understood there was no other option to provide care to patients. Vaccines were not yet available, and there was a limited quantity of personal protective equipment. Now, more than two-thirds of hospital workers are vaccinated, according to a September report in the American Journal of Infection Control, but they treat Covid patients who in most cases are severely ill because they have not been vaccinated. Hospitals also still sometimes ask nurses to use less personal protective equipment than they feel they need because of the cost or patients’ complaints, respondents said. “Even when objectively the risk level may be lower” because they are vaccinated and the Omicron variant is less severe than earlier variants, “when they were asked to take risk that no longer felt necessary, that was actually harder to handle and caused more distress”, Hendrickson said. Every day that Kadee Klafka works as a cardiac intensive care nurse at Ball Memorial hospital in Muncie, Indiana, she speaks with the families of Covid patients on ventilators, almost all of whom have not been vaccinated, she said. She often must inform them that their loved ones’ lungs won’t recover. “We have done every single thing we can,” she tells them. “Right now, they are just suffering, and the best thing we can do for them is make them comfortable.” Klafka wishes she could wear a GoPro camera to illuminate nurses and patients’ experience. “I have had to learn to cope with the anger that continues to rise and fall based on people who will not get vaccinated,” she said. Patients are often angry too because of how long they wait in the emergency room before they can get a bed, Bishop, the Philadelphia nurse, said. In 2021, 71% of medical practices saw an increase in the number of incidents with disruptive patients, according to a January poll from the Medical Group Management Association, which represents large physician groups. Bishop is also drained by two years of worrying about infecting her family, she said. She said the Omicron surge is even harder to manage than previous waves. “I felt like there was a light at the end of the tunnel, especially with the vaccine. I felt like we were getting back to normal, being able to go out and celebrate holidays and other life events with family,” said Bishop, who became a nurse because of her interest in the human body. “The staff is already mentally and physically exhausted, and this is pushing all of us to our breaking point.” Since February 2020, 30% of US healthcare workers have lost their job or quit, and the most common reason was the pandemic, according to an October survey by Morning Consult. Carol Wilcox worked as a discharge planner on a Covid floor at Saint Anne’s hospital in Fall River, Massachusetts, but retired 17 December, after four decades as a nurse. At the start of the pandemic, Wilcox, 65, woke up each day sick to her stomach and petrified. She and other staff weren’t allowed to wear masks because, like at other hospitals, supplies were limited and administrators “were afraid we would make people nervous”, she said. Before she retired, she felt worn out “just going in to see a patient and putting on the protective gear”, she said. In one case a couple months ago, Wilcox saw a woman who weeks earlier lost her husband to Covid and now had to decide whether she wanted to be on a ventilator. She said no and died. Neither were vaccinated. “We are giving people the best we can,” said Wilcox, who hopes to work part-time from home in case management. “I don’t know how long people can sustain. There is an underlying frustration with people who aren’t getting vaccinated because it’s just so sad.” But there are, perhaps, encouraging developments. Nurses can now make significantly more money than before the pandemic, particularly if they sign up to become travel nurses, due to increased demand. Enrollment in undergraduate nursing programs increased by 5.6% and by 4.1% in master’s programs in 2020, according to an American Association of Colleges of Nursing survey. At Sister Claire Tynan school of nursing at Holy Name in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 171 people applied to attend the school in 2019; in 2020, there were 325 applicants, and in 2021, there were 292, according to the school. “I think people are realizing that they can contribute to the positive effects in a hospital, that they have something to offer and that they will always have a career,” said Michele Acito, Holy Name chief nursing officer. Chloe Sneyer, 26, started her career in Holy Name surgery and cardiac units and then became an intensive care unit nurse during the pandemic. She now has more confidence in her skills, she said. “It made me realize I can learn something new every day that I go to work, and I can figure it out,” Sneyer added. Early in the pandemic, the hospital also tried to help nurses like Sneyer by having a psychologist host “resiliency rounds” over Zoom where staff could talk about a work experience; becoming sick with Covid; or the loss of a family member, among other topics, said Acito. In one recent case, an unvaccinated young man with Covid died after being on a ventilator. He had been in the hospital for weeks and become close with some staff, Acito said. “Two of our newer staff were very upset, so we made sure they had time to sit, to talk to other staff members,” recalled Acito. “They went outside; they took a little break … and then other staff members called them that night, so it’s that kind of support that has really strengthened that bond.” In addition to providing counseling, Hendrickson also said it’s important that hospitals seek input from healthcare workers on how to manage the risks they are facing, such as what personal protective equipment staff should wear or how food should be handled in inpatient units. “The more that can be actively listened to and reflected in policy decisions in a transparent way, those details make a huge difference for how it feels on the frontlines,” said Hendrickson. But much of healthcare workers’ wellbeing depends on the virus, which remains unpredictable. Wilcox said she fears for the healthcare system if the pandemic stretches on many more months or years. She told her former colleagues that she would return to visit. “But I don’t want to go back,” she said. “I really don’t. It is a war zone.”",News/World news,‘It’s a war zone’: healthcare workers show signs of stress similar to combat veterans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/healthcare-workers-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-pandemic-covid
1/19/2022,"The tracksuit era began – as every history student will learn from now on – on 11 March 2020, the day that the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic, and the age of lockdowns commenced. The details of its demise are, as yet, not officially verified – but they say that journalism is the first draft of history, so I’m calling it for 31 October 2021, when the dystopian seaweed-green tracksuits of Squid Game became the go-to Halloween costume.So now it is time to get back into your jeans. I don’t just mean getting them done up, although there is no doubt that may be a little tricky after two turgid years spent feeling dissatisfied with life while in eyeballing distance of the fridge. No, the real challenge is getting your head back into jeans, not your waistline. The most telling marker of the casualisation of our wardrobes is that jeans, which used to be what we wore to dress down, can now feel like too much effort. It’s not that I’m saying our standards have slipped, but – well, actually, that is exactly what I’m saying.There is nothing more satisfying to reach for in the morning than your favourite denims. Jeans are timeless and democratic, because while silhouettes, colours and washes come and go, everyone who owns a pair of jeans makes them their own. To look at someone who is wearing a pair that they love and that suit them is like looking at the perfect black and white portrait: candid, but flattering.  This year’s Golden Globes ceremony had no red carpet, but it was a fashion moment that has turbocharged the denim revival. Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog, one of the night’s big winners, is set in rural Montana in the 1920s, hinged between the dust-and-horses iconography of the cinematic western tradition and the modernity and raw energy of the 20th century as it begins to roar to top speed. Benedict Cumberbatch as Phil acts out masculine swagger in broken-in jeans with chaps, but it is Kodi Smit-McPhee as Peter who steals the fashion show. Slight and gawky in the stiff new jeans that his mother has bought him so that he will fit in on the ranch, he looks like a boy soldier in new uniform.In westerns, jeans stand for real-world toughness – resilience, to use the buzzword of the hour – but also for the American dream. The brass rivets that are a feature of every traditional pair glint like the nuggets for which goldrushers once panned the rivers of the western states. Also, jeans represent sex – as they always have and always will. (Think of the album cover of Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with the Boss’s jeans-clad back view standing in front of the stripes of the flag.) Resilience, fantasy, adventure and sex appeal: it is little wonder, really, that jeans are a style icon. The Power of the Dog is the latest and most lauded in a new wave of westerns – from News of the World to the very stylish The Harder They Fall – that are seducing us back to denim as a nostalgic, easy way to dress. If we had fallen out of love with jeans, it was at least partly because they got way too complicated. In the decade since the skinny jean began to fall from grace, the question of what jeans are “in” has become vexed. I have lost count of the number of clever women who have taken me aside to earnestly, quietly enquire whether it was still OK to wear skinnies, or what on earth a barrel leg or a peg leg was, or whether mum jeans are actually chic or a joke in which being a mum is the punchline. Designers and denim brands became embroiled in never-ending face-offs over high rise v ultra high rise, over wide leg or bootcut, patchworked or embroidered, indigo or bleached. Writing about what jeans to wear began to feel like reporting on an increasingly labyrinthine and remote civil war, in which no clear victor ever seemed to emerge and right and wrong had become impossible to judge. And jeans should not be that hard. They should be wardrobe route one: an easy option that you don’t have to waste time thinking about. Now they are coming back into focus, and without the hipster squabbling over what actually is the difference between a mum jean and a dad jean. Instead, the new denim style icons are stone-cold classics. Celine’s most recent Paris fashion week featured jeans that looked easy and timeless. Think Robert Redford in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Marilyn Monroe between takes on the set of The Misfits, photographed by Eve Arnold in rolled-hem jeans. The late, great Nick Kamen in that laundrette advert. Janet Jackson in the 1990s, in ripped jeans and a crop top. Elle Macpherson doing the noughties Holland Park school run in jeans and a blazer. This is a rich bloodline that traces back to the rugged utilitarianism of the western. But denim is a “thirsty” fabric to work with, requiring large quantities of water and energy during production. A pair of jeans is likely to have four or five times the carbon footprint of a T-shirt, because of the fabric’s heavier weight. The environmental impact is multilayered, and brands are addressing it via different strategies. Reformation uses non-hazardous low-impact chemical dyes to ensure worker safety and to reduce water usage. Its best-selling Cynthia high-rise straight leg jeans require 685 gallons (2.5 cubic metres) less water to make than conventional jeans. Frame has developed jeans made from biodegradable denim and thread, with rivets replaced by buttons and fastenings that can be removed, so the garment will fully disintegrate if buried at the end of its life. White Stuff uses 98% recycled water and 85% air drying in its manufacturing process, to cut energy usage. (Its very wearable Robyn barrel jeans, at £55, are well worth a look.) Nudie has pioneered Repair Shops, to normalise and ease the process of repairing and reworking jeans instead of replacing them. Scattergun approaches to the sustainability problem may perplex consumers, but there are ethical shopping strategies that everyone can agree on: buy fewer clothes, buy vintage where possible, minimise washing, and wear garments for longer. And on all of these metrics, jeans can score surprisingly highly. You only need one pair that you love and they will work with everything. Vintage is a brilliant way to shop for denim, not least because jeans change shape in their first few washes, so it is only when you try on a preworn pair that you can get a true sense of how they will fit. We have all known the disappointment of jeans that look good in the fitting room but slump into a saggy mess within weeks. Refreshing with an eco-friendly laundry spray and spot-cleaning is a quicker and less environmentally damaging way to care for them than overwashing. And best of all: jeans improve with age. My desert-island jeans, a pair of straight leg Levi’s 501s, were already vintage when I found them last year, and look even better now than they did then. If we fall back in love with our jeans, let’s hope it is for ever.",Lifestyle/Fashion,True blue: how to fall in love with jeans again,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/19/true-blue-how-to-fall-in-love-with-jeans-again
1/19/2022,"In 2020 the European Club Association conducted research into what it called the “Future Fan”. A survey across seven countries asked 14,000 people about their interest in football and how they interacted with the game. The survey recorded that among all fans only 40% regularly watched professional football in a stadium. Meanwhile 51% said they played Fifa at least once a month. This research caused a degree of consternation in the ECA, especially with its then president, Andrea Agnelli, who believed that “many traditional assumptions about fans need to change” and that the game may need to adapt to meet them. Within months, however, Agnelli’s thoughts had been rendered moot because he had been forced out of the ECA for embracing that most radical of changes: the European Super League.  For many, concern over the “future fan” was simply a cover for some of the biggest clubs wanting to abandon traditional structures in search of more money. But the ECA’s research was not inaccurate and the questions raised were legitimate. As football has grown into a global form of entertainment so those who call themselves fans have changed too. The majority no longer watch football live in person but digitally through a screen. Has the sport come to terms with that shift? Certainly clubs know more about their digital fanbase than they ever did about those clicking through the turnstiles. “The most sophisticated clubs have data coming from a lot of sources; I’d say more than a dozen,” says Roger A Breum, the head of marketing for Hookit, which specialises in tracking the digital footprint of sports teams and their sponsors. “Each of the social platforms they’re on gives them individualised data, then you probably have a social listening tool that’s bringing you broad data on hashtags that your club cares about. You have a sponsorship tool like ours and you might have tracking tools too. There’s a whole suite of sports tech software a club could use.” These tools mean that clubs know what messages and initiatives their fans are receptive to, what they are not and, in some cases, how strongly those opinions are held. “Sentiment analysis”, says Breum, is gleaned most cleanly from the comments under Instagram posts and from tweets. That’s where “the diehard fans are telling you how they feel,” he says. This information is well understood by the clubs, whether it be through their own insight teams or reports commissioned from consultants. They use it to tailor the kind of content they put on Instagram, or how they might help their sponsors run more effective ad campaigns. But that’s where it largely stops: the information is there to help the club run as a business, and it stays on the business side. “Historically there has been a gap between the commercial operations of the club and the sporting operations,” says Ben Marlow, of the consultancy 21st Group, which has worked with the Premier League and Tottenham among others. “I would still believe that to be the case. There’s an element of church and state.” Marlow’s opinion is shared by others who work with and inside Premier League clubs. He also observes that building a club’s strategy around fan sentiment would not be a great idea, but says that a “marriage between sporting performance and commercial performance” is important and that “the two drive each other”. Although sporting performance can be determined by league position, traditionally it involved making the fans happy too. Fans inside the ground, or “legacy fans” as they became known in ESL jargon, are less often the subject of customer research, their views on their club infrequently sought. But they do have the ability to make their opinions known directly to the footballing department, with the strength of their sentiment measured in decibels. There the link between results and enthusiasm is not always straightforward. At Selhurst Park Crystal Palace fans grew frustrated with Roy Hodgson despite mid-table security, while at Old Trafford Manchester United fans stuck with Ole Gunnar Solskjær to the end despite apparent underachievement. Digital fans do not have the same mechanism for making their feelings known. Yet no one would argue that they are short on opinions. This is particularly true on Twitter, perhaps the place where fandom is most alive outside matches and a place in a constant state of fulmination. As one Premier League executive puts it: “You can feel sometimes that the mood online is very different to the mood in the stadium.” Last year the journalist Dean van Nguyen wrote a taxonomy of one “extremely online” section of Liverpool’s fanbase, a type he called the “Twitter fan”. They were largely young, he wrote, obsessed with transfers, highly combative and persistently pessimistic. “Not getting what you want from football all of the time seems completely intolerable to them,” Van Nguyen wrote. He argued that similar groups existed in most clubs’ fanbases, something borne out by even the most cursory glance at a Premier League club’s hashtag. The Twitter fan does not represent every “future fan”, but it would seem hard to argue that they are not precisely the demographic that clubs want to reach and with the levels of “engagement” that would put them in the highest category of digital supporter. Their support is vocal and dedicated but much of it is critical, with that criticism left unacknowledged by clubs. Some of the criticism undoubtedly filters through, to players with an active social media presence and to other parts of the football department, including one former Premier League manager who in the latter days of his last job would obsessively check online comments the moment he stepped into the dressing room after a match. Other managers might choose to ignore the noise but have comments shared with them by friends and family, or their agent, anyway. More likely, however, the frustrations expressed on social media end up in the ear not of the club but other supporters. Van Nguyen writes that Liverpool’s “Twitter fans” often end up turning on match-going fans and have developed a name for them: “Top Reds”. That term is used in similar online disputes between Manchester United supporters. “You will be seen as elitist if you go to the games,” says one fan of a top-six club who travels home and away and also has a substantial social media following. “They do see us as the elite. If I speak out on issues that matter to match-going fans, be that ticket allocations, prices, games being picked for TV, the new fans do not give a shit. They do not care about these kind of issues. A lot of match-going fans don’t consider what they call ‘e-fans’ proper fans either. They think that if you don’t go, you don’t know.” It seems inevitable that the importance of the digital fan to football, especially at the top level, will only continue to grow. But while the commercial opportunities offered by a new audience have clearly been identified, it appears the other direction in the relationship, the one that involves listening, has not. Match-going fans might argue it has been ever thus. Perhaps in that respect supporters old and new may share some common ground.",Sport/Football,Digital fans represent football’s future so should clubs start listening? | Paul MacInnes,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/digital-fans-represent-footballs-future-so-should-clubs-start-listening
1/19/2022,"On 24 October 1962, an American nuclear chemist, Harrison Brown, started to pen a guest editorial for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists just as the Cuban missile crisis reached its climax. “I am writing on a plane en route from Los Angeles to Washington and for all I know this editorial … may never be published,” Brown said. “Never in history have people and nations been so close to death and destruction on such a vast scale. Midnight is upon us.”  With this dire warning, he was referring to the Doomsday Clock, which has been the Bulletin’s iconic motif since it was founded 75 years ago by Albert Einstein and some of the University of Chicago scientists from the Manhattan Project. Their work had contributed to making the atomic bomb, but many of them had been outraged when the US used it against Japanese cities. The image of the clock ticking away to midnight was intended to convey the sense of urgent peril, which Brown felt so viscerally on that 1962 flight to Washington. “He thought the world could end while he was on that flight,” said Rachel Bronson, the Bulletin’s current president. On Thursday, the Doomsday Clock will be unveiled for the 75th time, and we will find out what way the Bulletin’s panel of scientists and security experts will move the minute hand. For the past two years it has been stuck at 100 seconds to midnight. With Russia poised to attack Ukraine, it is hard to imagine the clock being set back, and that means that the experts assess we are in greater danger now than ever. The closest the clock came at the height of the cold war was two minutes to midnight in 1953 after the first detonation of a thermonuclear warhead, a hydrogen bomb. By the time of the Cuban missile crisis, the hands were at seven minutes to, but despite Brown’s apocalyptic editorial, the Bulletin decided not to move them forward because the shock of near catastrophe had given Washington and Moscow fresh incentive to work towards risk reduction and arms control. The furthest away from midnight the clock ever moved was 17 minutes, right at the end of the cold war. It has been slipping back towards extinction ever since. That is partly because of the increasing volatility of geopolitics, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and the new existential threat of climate change, which was formally made a factor in the calculation in 2007. The Doomsday Clock image was originally the work of Martyl Langsdorf, a noted abstract landscape artist of the era, whose husband, Alexander, was a physicist on the Manhattan Project. When he and his anxious colleagues decided to turn their mimeographed internal newsletter into a magazine in 1947, they turned to her to design the cover of the new Bulletin. She reckoned she was “the only artist they knew”. The design was originally going to be based on a U for Uranium, but the increasingly alarmed dinner table talk among the scientists in the couple’s social circle pushed Langsdorf towards more urgent imagery. “She took the imagery of countdowns and rocket launches and put it into a clock,” Bronson said. She added that the original time on the clock, seven minutes to midnight, “conveyed urgency, but also hope, a sense that there’s something we can do about it. We can set it back. And all of that in an image that is not language-dependent.” It is an image designed to cut through the dense nature of the underlying science to engage the public in the issues. It has since appeared in cold war novels, episodes of Doctor Who, songs by The Who and Iron Maiden. Boris Johnson referred to the Doomsday Clock in his speech to the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November, though he mistakenly said it was set at a minute to midnight. “He got the time wrong, but he used it and we agree with that part of it,” Bronson said. “We at the Bulletin believe that public engagement is crucial to this. In the US, we’re about to spend $1.8tn on a new nuclear arsenal. The public has to engage on this because it’s their money. “It’s really hard to stay engaged on an urgent issue that is 75 years old,” she added. “But it still is urgent, and through policy, and through art and through journalism, we have to be able to stave off the worst.” ",News/World news,Is midnight upon us?

1/19/2022,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No – it’s a Venezuelan propaganda campaign designed to burnish Nicolás Maduro’s strongman credentials with the help of a caped crusader called SuperBigote – or SuperMoustache. The musclebound cartoon superhero – who bears an unmistakable resemblance to Venezuela’s authoritarian president – has been met with acclaim or derision, depending on which side of the country’s bitter political schism viewers stand.  Pro-Maduro politicians have eulogized the “indestructible” beefcake, who appears on state television using his superpower – an iron left fist – to protect their socialist homeland from a Donald Trump-like villain. “It’s fantastic! Don’t miss it!” the deputy commerce minister Luis Villegas Ramírez tweeted after the latest instalment, in which SuperMoustache tried to send Cuban, Russian and Chinese Covid vaccines to Venezuelan citizens – only for the US to block delivery with the help of Maduro’s domestic enemies. “We’ll destroy them at last! They’ll suffer! They’ll weep! They’ll be the global epicentre of the pandemic!” the dastardly imperialist brags in heavily accented Spanish before SuperMoustache saves the day. “Nobody messes with SuperBigote,” state television channel VTV boasted on Twitter. Maduro’s foes have savaged the series, with pundits decrying what some called an attempt to build a cult of personality – or even a Goebbels-style attempt at mind control. Others wondered why the supposedly omnipotent SuperMoustache had failed to shield his country from humanitarian catastrophe. Julio Borges, a prominent opposition leader, suggested “Super Destroyer of Venezuela” would be a more appropriate name. “Maduro means misery and corruption,” Borges tweeted alongside photographs of Venezuelans scavenging for food. Guillermo Zubillaga, a Venezuela specialist at the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, said there was logic to the seemingly frivolous cartoon. He believed spin doctors hoped SuperMoustache would emphasize the invincibility of a politician who, against all odds, overcame a relentless US-backed campaign to topple him. “His superpower is staying in power,” said Zubillaga, pointing to critical support from China and Russia, whose deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, last week refused to rule out sending troops to Venezuela if tensions with the US continued to rise. “The message they are trying to convey is that they are in total control.” Maduro is not the first authoritarian to be cast as a comic book hero. In 2016 Chinese propagandists produced a cartoon version of their leader, Xi Jinping, in which the Communist party boss played Whac-a-Mole with corrupt officials. A year later, Moscow hosted an art exhibition called Super Putin, featuring sculptures and paintings celebrating Vladimir Putin’s superhero side. One showed Putin in a skin-tight Superman costume with the initials SP written on his chest. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, received a posthumous cartoon tribute in which Latin America revolutionaries such as Che Guevara and José Felix Ribas welcomed him to heaven. Zubillaga suspected propaganda officials saw SuperMoustache as a distraction from the far less amusing topic of Venezuela’s collapse. “It’s so ludicrous it gets people talking. It distracts you from the real reality of the 6 million people abroad, the malnutrition numbers, the fact that there are 250 political prisoners. “I think it’s effective. I wouldn’t dismiss it,” he added. “You repeat it so much … that people start to believe it.” Frank Dikötter, the author of a book about 20th-century cults of personality, was less sure. “The dictator’s dilemma is that he must show himself to be close to the people but, on the other hand, far above the fray – and particularly above his entourage, since anyone could stab him in the back at any one point in time. A cartoon seems to slightly undermine that sense of distance,” said the University of Hong Kong professor. Dikötter said art had long been used to signal the extraordinary and even supernatural qualities of such leaders: “But nothing as flippant as this. It’s not quite dignified is it?”",News/World news,SuperMoustache!

1/19/2022,"@TheKnowledge_GU Just watching the Chelsea FA Cup game and noticed that the two team abbreviations differ by only one alphabetical place. Surely this won’t happen very often? It can’t be beaten, but any others the same or close? pic.twitter.com/VArccT5cax When Chelsea met Chesterfield in the FA Cup third round, the preferred hashtag was #CHECHF rather than the more accurate and frankly soul-stirring #CHECHE. But this act of cultural vandalism did at least facilitate a decent question, and give our readers the opportunity to burst with trivia.  “When Colchester United knocked Crystal Palace out of the League Cup two years ago I thought it was just your everyday shock,” writes Neil O’Sullivan. “However, the full significance is apparent as the abbreviations for the two teams differ by just one place alphabetically: CPL v COL.” John McDougall has an example from international football. “If Australia played Austria it would be AUS v AUT,” offers John. “Not sure we have played them.” Not in the men’s game, as far as we can tell, but it has happened in the women’s game. In April 2015, AUT beat AUS 2-1 in a friendly. Here are a few more, via SCL MDA DSG Twitter. You’d think Bournemouth v Boreham Wood in the next round of the FA Cup would probably be BOU v BOR which is only a couple of letters out. Finally, a couple of kooky examples that have little to do with the original question but are nonetheless worthy of note. “When Sweden play at home to Denmark,” writes the mysterious XX, “the abbreviations spell SweDen and the omitted letters spell DenMark.” And finally, who could forget the great WALRUS of 2003? “This season will be the 30th season in a row where the English top flight is won by a non-English manager,” mails Jerry Higgins, arrogantly writing off Brighton’s title hopes. “Has any other league had such a long run of being won by non-domestic managers?” Tim Dockery has gone above and beyond on this one. “As I see it, a non-Saudi has won the Saudi Pro League every season since 1987,” he writes. “In that year, Khalil Al-Zayani, who had previously coached the Saudi national team to win the AFC Asian Cup in 1984, won the league with Al Ettifaq. In the 34 years since, the league has been won by coaches from 11 different countries.” Tim did list the winning coaches in all 34 seasons. For reasons of space, and perhaps sanity, we won’t print that here, but it includes Henri Michel, Omar Borrás, Artur Jorge, Joel Santana and our old friend Christian Gross. “Has any player had to leave a game after colliding with a referee?” wonders Gerard Parker. Let’s start with world football’s hottest property. In May 2020, when football was feeling its way back after Covid, Bayern Munich won 1-0 at Borussia Dortmund to effectively end the Bundesliga title race. Dortmund’s chances weren’t helped when Erling Haaland went off injured in the second half after twisting his knee when he collided with referee Tobias Stieler. Depending on which country you’re in, and whether you’re Arsène Wenger, you might be able to see the incident here. That’s the only example we’ve found of a player coming off injured after a collision with the referee. But officials can sometimes bear the brunt too, as was the case with Keith Stroud in 2015, when he had to be replaced at Hillsborough during Sheffield Wednesday’s game with Hull City. Chuba Akpom accidentally went through the back of him, resulting in the required change. Rutger IJzermans also has a bizarre tale that is well worth telling. “On 14 January 2018, during a Ligue 1 match between FC Nantes and Paris Saint-Germain, Nantes’ Diego Carlos accidentally collided with referee Tony Chapron,” writes Rutger. “If anything, it was the ref’s fault as he changed the course of his run and crossed Carlos’s path. This didn’t stop Chapron from kicking out at the player when he was on the floor. He gave Carlos a yellow card too, which happened to be his second of the game. So, technically, Diego Carlos had to leave the game after colliding with the referee. Here is footage of the incident.” Yes, there is a postscript. “Chapron was suspended after the match,” adds Rutger, “and ended his career as a ref.” “After playing almost one half as a centre-forward in last week’s Cup game against Vard, IK Start’s Kristoffer Paulsen has played in all the 10 different outfield positions of the side’s 4-3-3 formation this year,” wrote Eivind Lindeberg in 2007. “Even though he has yet to touch the keeper gloves, this sounds quite impressive. Anyone ever heard of something similar?” Step forward Steve Palmer, surely the only footballer to have attended Cambridge University, played a first-class cricket match for them and appeared during one season in 11 positions for a club. The campaign was 1997-98, Palmer was at Watford, and going into the final home game of the season it was noted that Mr Versatile had yet to don the goalkeeper’s jersey. Chris Wardle took up the tale: “Of course, when this was pointed out to Graham Taylor, Palmer had to start the match in goal. His teammates kicked off and immediately booted the ball into touch, allowing him to swap shirts with a defender who, coincidentally, happened to be Watford’s regular keeper.” Palmer finished the campaign having worn a full set of shirts from 1-14. More recently, in 2005-06, Sheffield Wednesday’s Lee Bullen achieved the feat. There was, as Richard Sargeant and Adrian Burkinshaw pointed out, a terrific twist when Bullen stood in as an emergency keeper at Millwall after an injury to David Lucas. “With no goalkeeper on the bench,” recalled Richard, “Lee, who had already played in all 10 outfield positions, was asked to put on the gloves. The Lions soon put the ball in the back of the net only for the referee to disallow the goal. Bullen went on to keep a clean sheet and the mighty Owls won 1-0.” Also worthy of a mention are David Webb and Mick Tait. Webb, noted Mark Turnbull, “played in all 11 positions for Chelsea – even starting in the goalkeeper’s jersey against Ipswich in December 1971, when he kept a clean sheet”. Webb got the nod because the regular goalkeeper Peter Bonetti and his deputy John Phillips were injured and the ‘A’ team keeper Steve Sherwood arrived too late despite a motorway dash. “I believe,” Mark added, “that Webb wore shirt numbers 1-11 at a time when numbers actually meant something.” Craig Wilson went similarly misty-eyed thinking about Tait’s contribution to Portsmouth. “He played in all 10 outfield positions, although admittedly over a slightly longer period than a year,” wrote Craig. “He was incredibly consistent, scoring goals and being just as brutal and clumsy in all of the positions he played. But that’s why we loved him.” “Fulham are top of the Championship with a goal difference of +47. I am acutely conscious of their capacity to screw things up, however, so what is the best goal difference a team has had and not been promoted,” asks Richard Hirst. In making his debut for @AVFCOfficial Coutinho has now played for 5 European teams, all of whom have won the European Cup or Champions League. Can anyone better that? “According to Wikipedia, Jesper Blomqvist only managed to score one goal for six of the clubs he played for: Milan, Parma, Manchester United, Everton, Djurgarden and Enkoping. Can any other outfield player boast a longer list of teams they have only scored a single goal for,” wonders Kieran Whooley. @TheKnowledge_GU with Boston United currently occupying a play off spot despite having lost as many games as they’ve won, has a side ever finished a season in the play offs (or better, been promoted) with more defeats than wins on their record? pic.twitter.com/ECJwjUgGcg Which player has been on the bench of their national team the most times, without ever making an appearance, even for a single minute?

1/19/2022,"Can a one-person event make a sport more diverse? Consider monobob, the accurately named bobsleigh event that will make its Olympic debut this year, six years after its first Youth Olympic Games competition. The name says it all – the driver does everything by herself.  And it is “herself” rather than “himself.” Women will be the only monobobists in Beijing. A step forward for gender equity? Not quite. Yes, women now have two bobsleigh events – the monobob and two-woman bob – matching the men, who have the two-man and four-man disciplines. But when it comes to the number of athletes at the Games, a women’s race for one-person sleds doesn’t balance out a men’s four-man race. The total number of places available in the bobsleigh events in Beijing is 124 for men and 46 for women. Indeed, the competition for places in the women’s events is so intense that Lolo Jones, the former world champion hurdler, didn’t make the US team one year after winning the world championship. While the monobob can’t deliver on gender diversity, it has the potential to add geographic diversity through a couple of unique rules. The first is to do with the equipment. Monobobs aren’t owned by national federations, which cuts out the possibility of rich countries splashing money to gain a technological edge. Instead, athletes race in standardized sleds provided by the organizers. The sled assigned to top-ranked US driver Elana Meyers Taylor is initially identical to the one assigned to every other competitor. That rule only goes so far, though, as countries can fine-tune their sleds, and some countries will always have more resources than others. The second rule could expand the sport’s geographic footprint. Sixteen countries will compete in the monobob, while only 12 could qualify in the two-woman event, opening up space for four countries that didn’t make the two-woman. But the IOC squashed an effort to reintroduce continental quotas this year, and the non-European contingent in women’s bobsled is stagnant. Instead, the two countries that earned spots by throwing all their eggs in the monobob basket are both European. The Netherlands’ Karlien Sleper qualified comfortably. Viktoria Cernanska, the 2020 Youth Olympic Games silver medalist in monobob, will be the first Slovakian woman in Olympic bobsleigh history. Non-traditional bobsleigh countries certainly gave it a try. Nigeria, which had a two-woman team in 2018 but focused exclusively this time around on monobob, wasn’t able to qualify despite Simidele Adeagbo’s win in the last Europe Cup event. Marina Silva Tuono couldn’t lock down a spot to give Brazil its second-ever women’s bobsleigh entry. Keomororkot Kong and Tran Thi Doan Trang fell short in their quest to be the first Winter Olympians from Cambodia and Vietnam. Like Adeagbo, Tuono and Kong pinned all of their hopes on monobob. To be sure, these entries typically clustered at the bottom of the standings in each race. But Adeagbo, a 2018 Olympian in skeleton, usually finished ahead of Lidiia Hunko, who earned Ukraine’s first-ever women’s bobsleigh spot. The difference came down to how events are weighted. All relevant monobob races were listed as “World Series” events, but those that coincided with World Cup weekends had far more points on offer than those that took place at Europe Cup or North American Cup stops. Hunko’s biggest point total of the season came at a 1 January event in Sigulda, where she finished last by a wide margin. Had Adeagbo competed in Sigulda, she likely would have taken Hunko’s spot in Beijing. Another factor limiting geographic diversity: Two-woman results are heavily weighted in the monobob selection process. Britain’s Mica McNeill barely competed in monobob this year but qualified for the Olympics based on her strong performance in two-woman races, including a World Cup runner-up finish in early January. (McNeill may choose to concentrate on the two-woman event in Beijing, which would open a space for Italy.) Still, monobob’s inclusion ensured repeat appearances for Jamaica and South Korea, each of whom barely missed out in the two-woman event. Even with standardized equipment, the women’s podiums are likely to have considerable overlap. Germany and Canada will have three spots in two-woman and two spots in monobob, and all of their representatives will be medal contenders. For the US, Taylor and newly naturalized Kaillie Humphries are 1-2 in the monobob rankings and tied for fourth in two-woman. So if you’re looking for another quirky event to add to your Winter Olympic viewing list, monobob is a good bet. If you’re looking for another Miracle on Ice, don’t count on seeing it here. Monobob has a slightly different feel than other bobsleigh events. The sleds themselves are roughly as heavy as those used in two-person races. Add the athletes and some ballast, and a two-woman sled can weigh up to 330kg, considerably heavier than the 248kg monobob max. With less weight and only one person doing the pushing, monobobs aren’t quite as fast as two-woman sleds and considerably slower than four-man sleds, which can weigh as much as 630kg fully loaded. On the Olympic track at Yanqing in October, a four-man sled hit 133.22 kph, the two-woman sleds topped out at 127.12 kph, and the monobobs’ max speed was 119.60 kph. That’s still faster than Clark Griswold in Christmas Vacation, but if you watch a multiple-rider event and a monobob race back to back, the speed difference is notable.",Sport/Sport,Can monobob shake up the world of bobsleigh on its Olympic debut?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/can-monobob-shake-up-the-world-of-bobsleigh-on-its-olympic-debut

1/19/2022,"Any athlete behaviour that is against the Olympic spirit or Chinese rules or laws will be subject to “certain punishment”, a Beijing 2022 official has said in response to a question about the possibility of athlete protests at next month’s Winter Games. It comes shortly after human rights advocates told athletes they were better off staying silent for the duration of the Games and amid concerns over the online security of attendees’ data contained in a mandatory phone app.  At a press conference on Tuesday, Yang Shu, the deputy director of international relations for the Beijing organising committee, said athletes could face cancellation of accreditation or other “certain punishments”. “Any expression that is in line with the Olympic spirit I’m sure will be protected,” said Yang. “Any behaviour or speech that is against the Olympic spirit, especially against the Chinese laws and regulations, are also subject to certain punishment.” Acts of protest at the Games are generally against the rules set by the International Olympic Committee, which also warned athletes not to protest at the Tokyo summer Games, or face potential punishment. However, there are mounting concerns over the increasing intolerance of protest, dissent or criticism in or against China. Numerous human rights activists and lawyers have been arrested and jailed, and last year the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, disappeared from public view for several weeks after she publicly accused a former senior official of sexual assault, sparking an international campaign over her wellbeing. On Tuesday night, a forum hosted by Human Rights Watch warned athletes about conducting any activism, including making statements, while in Beijing for the Games, and to be wary of the extraordinary reach of Chinese surveillance. Yaqiu Wang, a researcher on China for the organisation, said the disappearance of Peng was “a good indicator of what could possibly happen” if athletes spoke out. “Chinese laws are very vague on the crimes that can be used to prosecute people’s free speech,” she said. “There are all kinds of crimes that can be levelled at peaceful, critical comments. And in China the conviction rate is 99%.” “Athletes have an amazing platform and ability to speak out, to be leaders in society and yet the team is not letting them field questions on certain issues ahead of these Games,” said the US Nordic skier and former Olympian Noah Hoffman. “But my advice to athletes is to stay silent because it would threaten their own safety and that’s not a reasonable ask of athletes. They can speak out when they get back.” In the lead-up to the Games there have been concerns over how to protect attendees’ data and privacy while in Beijing. Last week, Team GB athletes were urged not to take their personal phones with them and were instead offered temporary replacements by the British Olympic Association, over government spying concerns. But a report published on Wednesday by the tech security watchdog Citizen Lab warned an app that all attendees were mandated to download had a “devastating flaw” that left personal and medical information, voice audio and file transfers vulnerable. The app, MY2022, collects sensitive personal information including a user’s name, phone number, ID number and email address, and health information including daily self-reported health status, vaccination status and Covid test results. The flaw allowed encryption protecting users’ voice audio and file transfers to be “trivially sidestepped”, Citizen Lab said. “Health customs forms which transmit passport details, demographic information, and medical and travel history are also vulnerable. Server responses can also be spoofed, allowing an attacker to display fake instructions to users.” Citizen Lab said the official Olympic Games Playbook outlines a number of entities that are allowed to process that personal data, including the organising committee and various Chinese authorities, but it did not specify “with whom or with which organisation(s) it would share users’ medical and health-related information”. The app also contains a feature allowing users to report “politically sensitive” content, and a currently inactive censorship keyword list, relating to topics including Xinjiang, Tibet, the Tiananmen Square massacre, insults against China and its leaders, and neutral references to Chinese government agencies and figures. In response, the International Olympic Committee said users could disable the app’s access to parts of their phones and that assessments from two unnamed cybersecurity organisations “confirmed that there are no critical vulnerabilities”. It also said installing the app was not required “as accredited personnel can log on to the health monitoring system on the web page instead”, but it had asked Citizen Lab for its report “to understand their concerns better”. Citizen Lab said it had told the Chinese Olympic organising committee about the issues in early December and had given it a 15-day deadline to respond and 45 days to fix the problem, but received no reply.

1/19/2022,"Inflation was supposed to be yesterday’s problem. This time last year, the government’s preferred measure of the annual increase in the cost of living was running at less than 1%. Now it stands at 5.4% – the highest in almost 30 years – and it has not peaked yet. With the lagged impact of the supply-chain bottlenecks of last autumn feeding through into prices in the shops and a likely 50% jump in domestic energy bills to come, inflation will certainly exceed 6% in April and may be closer to 7%.  Clearly, the data released by the Office for National Statistics will concern the Bank of England, which is mandated to hit the government’s 2% inflation target and has continually underestimated price pressure over the past year. The Bank’s monetary policy committee will next meet in early February – and with the cost of food, household goods, eating out, staying in hotels and clothing and footwear all pushing inflation higher last month – the chances of an increase in borrowing costs from 0.25% to 0.5% have increased. Threadneedle Street’s view is that inflation will peak in the spring and then start to head back down towards target. A return to a more normal economy as the impact of the Omicron variant wanes could help if consumers start spending less on goods (where inflationary pressure is most apparent) and more on services. But the ONS figures for producer prices – the cost paid by firms for fuel and raw materials and the cost of goods leaving factory gates – suggest there is plenty of inflationary pressure in the pipeline. Industry’s input prices were 13.5% higher in December than a year earlier while output prices were up 9.3%. In both cases there was only a small fall from November’s even higher levels, and the Bank’s fear is that, with firms struggling to find workers, higher prices will lead to higher wage settlements and an inflationary spiral will set in. Rishi Sunak is also feeling the heat. As Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds noted, households face a “triple whammy” over the coming months: higher taxes, higher energy bills, and wages failing to keep pace with prices. In his response to the highest inflation rate since John Major and Neil Kinnock were facing off during the 1992 election campaign, the chancellor said he understood the pressures people were facing with the cost of living. Sunak is working on a package of help for low-income households before the regulator Ofgem announces the new energy price cap early next month. Steadily rising inflation means the government needs to make it a generous one – or face a political price.",News/Business,"Inflation is back, and there’s plenty more in the pipeline",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/inflation-is-back-and-theres-plenty-more-in-the-pipeline
