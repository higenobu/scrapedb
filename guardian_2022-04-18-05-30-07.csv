4/18/2022,"Nerida O’Callaghan still remembers the first time she went to a miniature shop in the 1980s, in Sacramento, California. “I thought I died and went to heaven,” says the 75-year-old, now a retired Sydney primary school teacher. “I was always interested in miniatures but until then, I didn’t realise it was a legitimate hobby.” Inspired, she started working on a doll’s house – it would prove to be the gateway drug, as many others who ventured into the world of miniatures before her had found. “Once you get a doll’s house you buy a few things from time to time – because it’s more fun to fill it up over time. Then I had started making the dollhouse furniture myself, because there was nothing nice for sale for the nursery. Then I moved into making miniature food and plants – and it evolved into what it is now.” “What it is now” is a shop in her house, in Carlingford in Sydney, where O’Callaghan sells miniature merchandise to populate other people’s miniature worlds. Items for sale include miniature food, miniature plates and crockery sets, miniature gardens, miniature staircases, blocks of miniature cheese and miniature bottles of wine. They may be tiny, but more than 30 years of making miniatures has left O’Callaghan scrambling for space. A 3.6-metre scene of Paris sits where her dining room table should. “I’m a Francophile,” O’Callaghan says. “The Paris miniature just grew and grew!” The scene includes a French chocolate and wine shop and a patisserie, complete with a tiny rolling pin dusted with teeny-tiny sprinkles of flour. O’Callaghan uses a scale one-twelfth of the real size, and each piece is handmade with extraordinary and intricate detail. “There are people who just knit, and they knit miniature things that are so incredible – you wouldn’t believe it! Whatever you’ve got in big, you can make in little,” she says. O’Callaghan and her work are featured in the new series Tiny Oz, which premieres this week on the ABC, hosted by comedian Jimmy Rees and Adelaide-based miniature artist JoAnne Bouzianis-Sellick. The show sets a challenge for craftspeople and artisans from across Australia: to hand-build tiny tableaux that represent an earlier slice of Australian life. The miniaturists have recreated Broome in the pearling era; a hot air balloon launch in Adelaide; and the hundreds of zoo animals that were escorted through Sydney streets in 1916 to their new home at Taronga zoo. We watch as O’Callaghan dextrously uses paper, wires, glue and little scissors to make the tiny palm trees that line Macquarie Street. O’Callaghan has long been active in the miniature world – a community which, prior to the internet, you could only find by travelling to shows and conventions. “Doll clubs always had big shows on. I met people through that [and] we started a miniature convention in Australia,” she says. But the scene in Australia has nothing on the US, where miniatures are “second to stamp collecting when it comes to most popular hobbies”. And these days, she says, it’s in decline. “We have started six clubs – but they are all disappearing. So many people who started doing it are getting sick or have retired … [It’s] a dying thing, like all hobbies, because young people are on their computers and don’t want to do hobbies.” But perhaps the future isn’t so bleak. Bouzianis-Sellick, makes her own miniatures for film animation work in Adelaide. “I get to make mini props and mini wardrobes. I get paid to go to kindergarten every day!” She hopes Covid-19 – and its resulting lockdowns – have brought a new generation of younger hobbyists to the pastime. “A lot of kids were saying to their parents, ‘I want to be more crafty,’” she says; she remembers waiting in line outside a model store as the pandemic ramped up. New technologies have given it cross-generational appeal, too. “A lot of the guys who are in their 60s, 70s and 80s say ‘my grandson helped me 3D print a part’,” Bouzianis-Sellick says. “They have found a younger generation that has a more technical side, and they can bring them in.” Tiny Oz premieres on the ABC on Tuesday 19 April ",Lifestyle/Life and style,"The grand world of tiny things: ‘Whatever you’ve got in big, you can make in little’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/18/the-grand-world-of-tiny-things-whatever-youve-got-in-big-you-can-make-in-little
4/18/2022,"United Nations experts have accused Australia of failing to prevent the “sheer obliteration of the rights” of its own citizens including children who are held in “sordid” conditions in camps in north-eastern Syria. In a move that humanitarian groups hope will intensify pressure on Australia to act, 12 UN special rapporteurs have written jointly to the government to raise concerns about 46 Australian citizens, including 30 children, held in the camps. The letter raises deep concerns about conditions in al-Hawl and Roj camps, “where most of these individuals are held and are deprived of their liberty without any judicial process”. It warns that children have been suffering from “malnourishment” and “dire housing and sanitary conditions” and are showing signs of trauma. The UN special rapporteurs say they believe the conditions “constitute a violation of a number of human rights, and meet the standard of torture or other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”. The letter renews calls for the Australian government to repatriate its citizens, saying this is “the only legal and humane response to the complex and precarious human rights, humanitarian and security situation”. The camps are managed by Kurdish authorities. Those detained are believed to include family members of men who travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight for Islamic State. Supporters of the women and children say their individual stories vary but many were tricked into going there or were trafficking victims. The Australian government has repeatedly raised concerns about the conditions in the camps, but has maintained it will only consider repatriations on a case-by-case basis and is focused on protecting “the Australian community”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The UN letter to the Australian government, written in February but only released on Sunday, acknowledges the difficult circumstances surrounding the detentions, but adds that this cannot be a justification for inaction. “It is our considered view that any argument based on the extreme nature of the situation cannot be used to justify such already lengthy detentions and the complete lack of steps taken by your Excellency’s government to remedy the sheer obliteration of the rights of Australian citizens resulting from their arbitrary deprivation of liberty,” the letter says. “The absolute prohibition of arbitrary detention in international law is considered so fundamental that it remains applicable even in the most exceptional situations.” The letter also says that under international law, children are considered vulnerable and in need of special protection. No child can be “deemed unworthy of human rights protection by virtue of the status or acts of his parents”. The UN experts said some of the women may have been coerced or trafficked into Syria, and any responses by governments must not “perpetuate or contribute further harm to those who have already experienced profound violence and trauma”. “Australia must be mindful of the potential for coercion, co-option, trafficking, enslavement, sexual exploitation, and harm upon joining or being associated with a non-state armed group, not to mention on-line grooming and recruitment for marriage, sexual or household services or labour for the organization,” the letter said. The letter also raised concern about Australia’s use of citizenship-stripping powers to address the threat of terrorism. It said individuals detained in north-east Syria did not have meaningful access to lawyers and may be subjected to “arbitrary deprivation of citizenship”. Save the Children Australia said the UN letter underlined that the children were victims of Isis and should be cared by Australia as such. “The UN has called out Australia for failing to meet its obligations to children,” the acting chief executive of Save the Children Australia, Mat Tinkler, said. “If this admonishment won’t prompt the repatriation of innocent, vulnerable children, exactly what will it take?” Australia’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Amanda Gorely, wrote in response to the UN letter that Australia “remains concerned about the situation in North-East Syria” and described it as a “challenging environment”. “Australia considers all circumstances when approaching the question of repatriations from Syria and responds on a case-by-case basis,” Gorely wrote in a letter also released on Sunday. “In June 2019, the Australian government facilitated the return of all unaccompanied Australian minors known to us at that time.” Gorely said Australia “does not accept that it exercises jurisdiction over detention facilities in North-East Syria such as to engage the extraterritorial application of Australia’s international human rights obligations”. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said on Sunday the government “did everything we could to dissuade and prevent Australians from travelling to that zone in the first place”. “And unfortunately a number still chose to do that, both women and men, and there are of course … a number of children who are with largely their mothers at this stage, still in that zone,” she told the ABC’s Insiders program. “What we have to take into account is the safety of all Australians, including here domestically, and these are matters that we continue to discuss within the government.” Payne said she would “not go into the specifics of any intelligence of course, but ultimately, they are Australians who have found themselves in this position because their parents took themselves to those war zones”. Fabrizio Carboni, a regional director of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), has previously described the situation in the camps as “one of the most complex child protection crises today” and said children “must be treated first and foremost as victims”. Guardian Australia reported last year an 11-year-old Australian girl had collapsed due to suspected malnutrition in al-Roj camp and had required help from ambulance medics. Last week British MPs and a human rights group called on the UK government to repatriate a young British boy and his gravely ill mother from a detention camp in Syria, after doctors said she was at risk of dying and leaving the child orphaned.",News/Australia news,"Australia failing its own citizens held in ‘sordid’ camps in Syria, UN experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/australia-failing-its-own-citizens-held-in-sordid-camps-in-syria-un-experts-say
4/18/2022,"Before the pandemic and its many controversies, vaping – the use of electronic nicotine (or non-nicotine) delivery systems or e-cigarettes – was one of the most contentious topics online. Talking about vaccines would start arguments, discussing raw milk might get some hate, but even the slightest hint of a position on vaping would get you immediately inundated with passionate replies from whichever side you had offended. There are many reasons for all this passion, but the main thing has to do with uncertainty, and how we make public health decisions. The new fantastically comprehensive report into vaping in Australia, which has resulted in calls to ban vaping entirely for younger Australians, is merely the latest in a long line of intense discussions. Depending on who you listen to, vaping is either a direct threat to human life, and children in particular, or the best public health intervention of the last 100 years, which has only fuelled the controversy on the practice. The basic idea behind this discussion is simple: vaping is a way of ingesting nicotine (and other substances) that is far safer than smoking. If we move people from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, as the World Health Organization review into the topic notes, it is almost certain that their health will improve, because e-cigarettes (and vape pens, cartridges etc) produce far lower levels of the most harmful chemicals that you inhale when you smoke. But there are several obvious issues with this. Firstly, vapes aren’t a homogenous intervention – there is enormous variability in vaping products and devices. The market is largely unregulated, which means the term “vape” covers everything from solid, reliable devices to something that will explode when you put it in your mouth. These harms, while real, are thankfully pretty rare – even the biggest short-term issue, which is to do with serious lung disease caused largely by vapes containing a specific additive derived from cannabis, has only been seen a relatively small number of times. Yes, they’re important, but they aren’t really what we’re interested in when discussing vaping policy more broadly. No, the real debate centres on a series of incredibly complex problems that continue to divide the topic of vaping today. On the one hand, switching to vaping from smoking (ie giving up cigarettes entirely) is probably good for your health. That being said, the epidemiological evidence shows that this is relatively uncommon – while some people do use vaping to quit smoking entirely, most become what’s known as “dual users” who both vape and smoke in differing amounts. The evidence on whether dual use is beneficial (as opposed to just smoking) is mixed, because the practice itself covers everything from people who rarely smoke and predominantly vape to those who basically add vaping to their current smoking regime. To add fuel to the fire there is experimental research, where people are randomised to either vape or quit smoking cold turkey, that seems to indicate some benefit for vaping. Unfortunately, these studies tend to be low-quality and it’s hard to know whether their results hold up outside of a clinical setting, although there is some evidence that they will. Moreover, vaping is obviously worse for your health than quitting entirely. While long-term problems have yet to be fully identified – vaping only became common in the last decade or so – there is certainly reason to believe that vaping is not entirely harmless, particularly given the massive spectrum of products you can use to vape. On top of this, there’s pretty good evidence that vaping nicotine products is habit-forming and addictive, and there’s a great deal of concern among epidemiologists that specifically in young people vaping can lead to smoking, which is obviously a bad thing. Even this is hotly debated, because it’s hard to know whether vaping causes smoking or if it’s just that young people who start vaping are more likely to become smokers in the future anyway. In addition, because somehow this topic gets even more complex, the recent evidence in Australia shows that people are vaping at ever-increasing rates. A 2019 report from the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare found that about 3% of Australians are vaping regularly, which is low but also double the proportion from 2016. In counterpoint to this, we’ve got data from the UK, where vaping has been deregulated for some time, showing that vaping rates have stabilised at about 6-7% of the population, even in younger people. All of this complexity brings us back to the reason behind the vigorous debate – the simple truth is that this is all horribly complicated. On the one hand, from an individual perspective, switching entirely from smoking to vaping is almost certainly a good choice. That being said, picking up vaping is probably not a great idea if you don’t already smoke. From a public health perspective, the question of whether the harms of vaping, which are still a bit uncertain, outweigh the benefits of getting people to stop smoking is complex and almost certain to be an ongoing debate. Usually I’d end here with some pithy sum-up that gives you basic advice on what to do, but the reality is that it’s a bit too complicated for even that. I’m certain to get hate mail from lots of people saying that I’ve oversimplified certain points – which is true, because you can only cover so many things in a single column – and from others saying I’ve not been harsh or lenient enough on vaping generally. Is it likely that vaping will save a billion lives? Probably not. Is it better for you personally to vape than to smoke? Yes, definitely. Between those two ideas, there is an enormous grey area, and unfortunately what we’re left with is a great number of questions and not many satisfying answers.

4/18/2022,"Health experts are warning Australia could soon face its worst flu season in years as Covid transmission across the country remains high. There were more than 360,000 positive tests recorded around the country in the past week, and nearly half a million people are isolating with active Covid-19. Thanks to vaccination and the less severe but highly transmissible Omicron variant, the vast majority of people who get Covid will have symptoms that are manageable at home. If you are self-isolating with Covid, these are some treatments and techniques that may help to alleviate symptoms. Support services and home care guides are available to help people assess Covid symptoms, including the coronavirus hotline on 1800 675 398, the federal government’s Health Direct guidelines, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners’ guide. Staying well hydrated is important after a Covid diagnosis, says Dr Suzi Nou, a Melbourne anaesthetist who has been managing Covid-positive patients in the community. Since the surge of the Omicron BA.2 subvariant, Nou has noticed an increase in Covid patients presenting mainly with gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly in children and teenagers, which can contribute to dehydration. “Their presenting symptom is diarrhoea or vomiting,” Nou says, also noting nausea, loss of appetite, and weight loss. “I’ve been surprised with how dehydrated people have been getting.” She advises her Covid patients to avoid spicy and rich foods and to “really keep the fluids up. It seems to be – more so than your usual cold – something that can really upset your tummy and cause dehydration”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The RACGP’s home care guide suggests individuals “manage hydration carefully through small regular sips of fluid, and consider oral rehydration salts” such as Hydralyte. To avoid dehydration, you should “drink water before you feel thirsty”, according to Health and Wellbeing Queensland. “An easy way to tell if you are hydrated enough is by the colour of your urine – drink enough so it is pale yellow.” A cough or mild shortness of breath may be improved by lying on your front rather than your back. Prone positioning may “improve oxygen levels in the blood”, according to Covid-19 clinical evidence taskforce guidelines. “We know that more of your lung tissue is at your back,” says Nou. “If you lie on your front, the effects of gravity mean that the water in your lungs will come to your front so you’ll have more lung surface area to help with breathing.” Severe difficulty breathing or worsening shortness of breath, however, are considered red flags that indicate someone may need hospital care, as are fainting or collapse and blue lips or face. Nasal sprays may also help to provide relief for symptoms of nasal congestion, the RACGP guide suggests. “I repeat to all my patients that Covid infects your whole body. Let’s get away from this idea of it just being a respiratory illness,” Nou says. “If you are getting fatigued, to me that’s a sign that you do have some of it affecting your brain, which is very common.” Other common symptoms include difficulty concentrating, visual changes, and mood disturbances. Nou’s advice is “to let your brain rest, particularly when you’re in that first seven to 14 days of being unwell”. She suggests to her patients to minimise time spent in front of screens. “It’s a little bit like if people have a concussion.” The fatigue may persist after the acute infection, and a staged return to work or school may be necessary for some. “Some people can get back to work [straight away] and be fine,” says Nou. “Some people take a little bit longer.” “It’s not like muscle [that you] just keep pushing and working harder, and get stronger and better. It’s actually inflammation,” she says. “With inflammation, you’re actually better off … reducing activity and letting [it] settle.” Paracetamol or ibuprofen can be taken to alleviate symptoms, including a fever or body aches. Experts note that pregnant women, however, should avoid ibuprofen. Doctors may prescribe oral antiviral drugs for certain people with mild Covid who are at higher risk of developing severe disease – such as those who are unvaccinated, older than 60, or have underlying chronic medical conditions. There is little clinical evidence to suggest that vitamin supplements are beneficial in treating or preventing Covid. Vitamin D – which can be toxic in high doses – has been discussed in relation to the coronavirus, but one systematic review found: “The evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation for the treatment of Covid‐19 is very uncertain.” A 2021 clinical trial in people with mild Covid-19 found that taking high-dose zinc, vitamin C or a combination of the two supplements had no benefit in reducing the duration of symptoms. Australia’s clinical evidence taskforce guidelines don not recommend zinc, among certain other therapeutics, as a treatment for Covid: “There is not enough evidence to support the safe and effective use of these drugs.” In addition, vitamin C is water soluble; if you consume more than your body can store, it isn’t toxic, but it is excreted in urine. “Excess vitamin C literally goes down the toilet,” Healthdirect, the national public health information service, points out. In many cases, as health experts have previously pointed out, taking multivitamins just results in “very expensive urine”. Getting an adequate sleep and having a balanced diet may help to boost one’s immune system, but the best protections against Covid are oft-repeated public health measures: getting vaccinated and boosted, wearing a mask, and opting to spend time outdoor or in well-ventilated spaces. “The biggest thing in terms of not getting infected – rather than boosting your immune system and spending money on vitamins and supplements – is just avoiding high-risk situations and wearing the right protection while having to go into high-risk situations,” says Nou. “I’d rather spend my money on an N95 mask.”",News/World news,What can I do to ease Covid symptoms at home?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/what-can-i-do-to-ease-covid-symptoms-at-home
4/18/2022,"Katie Leigh French was Sue Walton’s stepdaughter, but Walton never really made the distinction. One of six daughters in a blended family, French – like her stepmum – worked in aged care, and the pair “used to talk all the time, night shift, on the phone or she’d text me”. That was until July of last year when, just two weeks after giving birth to a baby boy, French was told that she had stage 4 cancer. She was given three months to live. She was 35 years old. Soon after her diagnosis, French talked to her stepmum about her decision to apply to access voluntary assisted dying (VAD), with all the pragmatism of a couple of aged care workers. “She said, ‘I’m going to do it’, and it seemed like she was sort of waiting for approval. And I said: ‘Kate, it’s your body. It’s your choice’,” says Walton. “I know what’s going to happen at the end of all of this, and so do you. And you have the right to decide what to do.” French had moved to Victoria, the first state in Australia to legalise voluntary assisted dying, before she discovered she was ill and so she was eligible to make use of that state’s laws. While she longed to come home to her dad, her stepmum, and her friends and family in Kanahooka, NSW, she was anchored to Melbourne by the lockbox of life-ending medication she’d jumped through legal hoops to attain – and the knowledge that if she returned home to NSW to use it, she’d be breaking the law in the last state in Australia yet to legalise voluntary assisted dying. Last month marked the third time in a decade that the NSW upper house has debated voluntary assisted dying. ​​NSW had been in line to become the first Australian state to legislate it in 2017, but the bill failed to pass in the upper house by just one vote. Days later, Victoria legalised voluntary euthanasia. In 2021 the issue took on an extraordinary momentum across the country, with a similar scheme to Victoria’s coming into effect in Western Australia in July, and Tasmania and South Australia passing legislation in the same year. The federal government has denied the territories the chance to make their own laws on the issue. All of this means that the rules on voluntary assisted dying are not uniform across Australia. It leaves some terminally ill people in one state or territory unable to choose to end their lives, while those on the other side of the border can. And it leaves a few, like French, stuck between family on one side, and the death they want on the other. NSW’s latest bill finally passed the lower house in November 2021, on the last day of parliamentary sitting for the year. Three months later Walton stood outside parliament house in the rain, at a rally to urge members to push the bill through the upper house. Walton told organisers she’d return to the next rally, in between trips back and forth from NSW to Melbourne to care for French. Protests like this kept her busy, kept her mind off things, but she also had something else tugging at her, a promise she’d made to her daughter: to be by her side when she decided to take the medication that would end her life. But just over 24 hours later, French was dead. Independent member for Sydney Alex Greenwich knows a bit about the cost of delaying this kind of legislation, having co-sponsored failed bills in the past. This time around, he’s led the process, introducing the latest bill in October last year. With each bid to get the legislation up, Greenwich has been confronted by the costs of delay to the people desperate to see such a bill passed. “Dealing with disappointing people that we haven’t resolved this for yet is tough, but it’s certainly not as tough as the cruel deaths that people experience and the trauma that their family members then face.” When French received her diagnosis last year, it was via Zoom. The city was about to enter hard lockdown again, and Walton began the task of coordinating with two state governments to get over the border to help nurse her daughter and take care of their newborn grandson, Jameson, the baby French had spent 10 years trying to conceive. It was the start of a dawning realisation of just how diabolical navigating the sometimes vastly different bureaucracies of neighbouring states could be. Walton and her husband spent the next six months driving up and down the Hume to see French. (Walton’s husband, Andrew, has leukaemia and can’t get on a plane due to his compromised immune system.) Having only moved to Victoria shortly before the pandemic hit, Walton says French and her husband hadn’t yet had a chance to build up much of a support network. They tried to get back home to Kanahooka as often as they could, but always returned to Melbourne. The young mother’s last trip home was for Christmas with her large extended family. “It was an extremely emotional time … for her and us, as she dearly wanted to stay at home and be with us all for whatever time was left,” says Walton. “If the law was in NSW, she would’ve been here with us and all her sisters, all her friends and all her family. “But with all our hearts broken she went back to Victoria.” In an April 2021 Australia Institute poll, three-quarters of Australians agreed with the principle that a person who is experiencing suffering that cannot be relieved and who asks to die should be allowed to receive the assistance of a doctor to do so. Another July 2021 Australian Institute poll found that seven in 10 NSW voters think that voluntary assisted dying should be legal. Greenwich’s current proposal, despite being personally opposed by both premier Dominic Perrottet and opposition leader Chris Minns, is backed by 28 MPs, including members of the government, crossbench and the Labor opposition – the highest number of co-sponsors to a bill in the history of any Australian parliament. In all the states that have thus far legalised it, VAD is only available to adults with decision-making capacity in the end stages of a terminal illness, and who are suffering intolerably. The person must maintain decision-making capacity throughout the process and make repeated requests for VAD. They can withdraw at any time. Amid caring for her newborn and dealing with increasingly painful symptoms, French applied for access to VAD in August. It was approved by February. By then, French had well outlived her three month prognosis. And even then, Walton says she was reluctant to actually order the medication to be delivered to her house. The latest figures from Victoria’s voluntary assisted dying report of operations show that since June 2019, when the act came into force, until 30 June 2021, 836 people were assessed for eligibility to access VAD. Of those, 674 permit applications were made and 597 permits were issued. Of those permits, 331 people have died from taking the prescribed medications. As reflected in Victoria’s data, many people who are granted a permit for medication don’t utilise it. But for Walton, being in a different state provided another level of difficulty, given she was determined to honour her promise to be by French’s side if and when she decided to take the medication. “For the last five weeks she was asking us: ‘Can you come down tomorrow? I’m going to do it.’ And so we’d prepare to leave at three in the morning, and we’d ask her if she could wait that long, and then, hours later, she’d say, ‘I’m not taking it tomorrow’. And that’s been going on for weeks. “She was clinging by the fingernails, as long as could,” says Walton. “The tumours became so large in her bones that they fractured – they actually splintered – she had a broken left arm. We knew that would happen, she knew that would happen, but she just didn’t want to leave her little fella.” French was determined to see her son’s first birthday. Instead, on Walton and her husband’s last visit to Melbourne, as Jameson turned seven months old, French decided to throw a party. “She didn’t want to miss his first birthday party. So we held one early.” After the party Walton and her husband reluctantly returned home in time for Andrew’s regular course of treatments for his leukaemia. That was the week that Walton decided to step up to the Dying with Dignity rally. The week she had no idea just how little time there was left. After Jameson’s party, French’s condition rapidly deteriorated. She had begun to lose consciousness. Her family made preparations to once again head down the freeway to be by her side. But on the Thursday morning, the day after the rally, she suddenly became conscious and with her husband by her side took the medication. She passed away an hour later. Greenwich has been struck by the stories of family members like Walton. “There’s just a massive amount of stories in NSW, coupled with the sheer inequity that then exists by the fact that people in Victoria and Western Australia can already access this, and soon people in all of the other states.” By the time the NSW upper house concluded debate, a majority of members had spoken in favour of the VAD bill. Advocates like Dying with Dignity’s Shayne Higson now believe it’s likely the legislation will pass when parliament resumes in mid-May. If it then passes without amendment, she estimates it could be implemented by the end of 2023. “Of course for some terminally people in NSW that will still be too late for them to access.” And for their families, that means trying to make peace with the way they died. “I don’t make a promise easily. It means an awful lot to me,” says Walton. “And I now have to live with the fact that I didn’t keep my promise to be there for Katie’s last breath. And I don’t know whether she would’ve known or not, but I know myself. So that’s just another thing that breaks my heart.”",News/Society,"Australians have unequal rights to die.

4/18/2022,"A 1.8-metre public sculpture of an anthropomorphic banana in Melbourne that was removed for repairs may never be reinstated, with the council unable to commit to its return. The artwork, which features a menacing skull facing Rose Street in Fitzroy, was created by artist Adam Stone and titled Fallen Fruit. Erected on 8 November last year, it was bought by the City of Yarra for $22,000 out of a $100,000 grant bestowed by the Transport Accident Commission. But within weeks, the banana was vandalised with a saw, in an apparent decapitation attempt. The incident was caught on CCTV and Victoria police launched an appeal for information to find the offenders. It was subsequently removed for repairs. It has since been replaced with a giant yellow pot with plants and flowers, created by Yarra based business The Plant Society, to herald the council’s upcoming Garden State festival. “Fallen Fruit was vandalised and had to be removed. Officers are investigating options and no decisions have yet been made about whether and how it might be reinstated,” a Yarra city council spokesperson said. Stone did not respond to a request for comment. After the vandalism of his piece, Stone said that it was an “upsetting” act. “It was pretty surprising and upsetting to see the work so dramatically vandalised, but also there’s not much that can be done when the work is in the public arena,” Stone said at the time. “You have to just let go and put it out there.” The piece is displayed prominently on the artist’s website, pictured in place on the Fitzroy street corner. Stone is a Victorian College of the Arts graduate, and a past winner of the Montalto Sculpture prize and Fiona Myer award. His banana themed pieces are part of a broader output that has been shown in galleries around Australia and Asia. He previously said he hoped that with Fallen Fruit “people from a variety of backgrounds could find the work fun and engaging, and … perhaps consider the conceptual meaning of the work”. “I was thinking about hubris in western society and our obsession with unsustainable excess and how this affects the environment.” The piece was described by the council as “eye-catching”. “The sculpture directly references the 1970s phenomenon of oversized, kitsch roadside objects – the big banana, pavlova, koala, submarine, merino – constructed to seduce travellers and passersby to stop for a photo opportunity and increase tourism and revenue in regional highway towns,” a description that remains on the council’s website said. “Fallen Fruit seeks to both engage with and subvert this tradition. The work does this by employing the symbol of the banana, anthropomorphised through the inclusion of a human skull, a memento mori to meditate on our western tendencies towards unsustainable desires and excess.”",News/Australia news,Banana splits: inner-Melbourne council won’t commit to returning controversial fruit sculpture ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/banana-splits-inner-melbourne-council-wont-commit-to-returning-controversial-fruit-sculpture
4/18/2022,"Voters in the Liberal-held seat of North Sydney have ranked climate and the environment as a higher priority than the economy, while they see integrity in politics as narrowly more important than the cost of living, a new poll shows. With Scott Morrison placing the economy at the centre of his re-election pitch and playing down his broken promise to establish a commonwealth integrity commission, the poll highlights pressures the Coalition may face as it seeks to hold socially progressive seats. High-profile independent candidates including Kylea Tink, who is challenging Liberal moderate Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney, are seeking to place climate action and a fully fledged integrity commission at the centre of their campaigns. A telephone poll asked 1,114 adults in North Sydney on 11 and 12 April which issue, out of a set of options, was “most important to you when deciding how to vote in the upcoming federal election”. The top result (27.2%) was climate and the environment, followed by the economy (19.7%), according to the poll commissioned by Climate 200, which is backing a range of independent candidates including Tink. The next highest result was integrity and trust in politics (16.2%) which was similar to the fourth result, cost of living (12.6%). The less popular options in North Sydney were national security (10.2%), health and aged care (6.9%), and education and training (2.2%). The polling report by Community Engagement, which carried out the survey, said the data was weighted based on gender, age, education and recall of their vote at the last election, with an effective margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. It is understood Climate 200 also polled voters in a range of other “new marginal” seats in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth through March and April, with integrity showing up as one of the top issues. Guardian Australia has been told integrity rates as the main concern for 19.5% of respondents in the WA seat of Curtin (held by Liberal MP Celia Hammond), 18.6% of respondents in the Victorian seat of Goldstein (Tim Wilson), 20.4% in Kooyong (Josh Frydenberg) and 19.6% in Wentworth (Dave Sharma). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Over the past few days, Morrison has been on the defensive over the Coalition’s failure to legislate a commonwealth integrity commission despite promising to do so before the 2019 election. The prime minister said Australia needed an integrity commission “that is driven by the processes of the rule of law, that doesn’t seek to judge people before they’re able to have their matters properly considered”. Morrison has sought to blame Labor for not supporting the model proposed by the Coalition – an explanation derided by retired judges as “spurious”. The government released an exposure draft but never introduced a bill to parliament, where the proposal could have been amended by Labor and the crossbench together with Liberal defectors who support a stronger model. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, pledged to legislate a strong anti-corruption commission by the end of 2022. Tink said the prime minister had “dismissed our community and other ‘inner-city seats’ too often”, and recent developments showed the limited influence of Liberal “moderates” in shaping the party’s direction. “Our two-party political system is broken and nowhere is this clearer than in Scott Morrison’s dismissal of the need for a robust national anti-corruption commission,” she said. “Equally concerning is his refusal to disendorse Katherine Deves as the Liberal candidate for the neighbouring seat of Warringah despite her appalling vilification of the trans community, one of the most vulnerable groups of people in our nation.” Government frontbenchers spent the weekend defending Deves, noting the candidate had apologised for her remarks, despite growing concerns among Liberal moderates that her candidacy would prove damaging to the party’s standing with voters in key metropolitan contests. News stories over the past week have revealed inflammatory comments on various social media platforms including one where Deves equated anti-trans activism to standing up against the Holocaust during a YouTube panel. Matt Kean, the NSW treasurer and a leading Liberal party moderate, called for Deves to be disendorsed. Morrison defended Deves on Saturday and said he would not be “joining that pile on” against her. On Sunday the prime minister sought to further clarify his previously stated support for a private member’s bill proposed by the Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler in relation to single-sex sport. Morrison said he had never stated it would be a government bill. “There are many, many different views on this,” Morrison said. “I am not seeking to bind at all any of my members of parliament on these issues as a party position.” Chandler has said her bill would clarify that “sporting activity can be operated on the basis of sex”. However, Australia’s Sex Discrimination Act already says it is legal “to discriminate on the ground of sex, gender identity or intersex status by excluding persons from participation in any competitive sporting activity in which the strength, stamina or physique of competitors is relevant”. The same North Sydney poll found Zimmerman was sitting on a primary vote of 37.1%, compared with 19.4% for Tink and 17.3% for Labor candidate Catherine Renshaw. The poll also found 8.7% primary vote support for Lynne Saville of the Greens, and 5.6% for Robert Nalbandian from United Australia party. Parties generally treat individual seat polls with caution, and they only represent sentiment at a point in time rather than predicting an outcome, but the results indicate preferences are likely to be crucial in determining the outcome in North Sydney.",News/Australia news,"Voters in hotly contested Liberal-held seat rank climate and environment over economy, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/18/voters-in-hotly-contested-liberal-held-seat-rank-climate-and-environment-over-economy-poll-finds
4/18/2022,"Thomas Tuchel insisted Chelsea will be ready to take on of the “strongest teams in the world” in the FA Cup final next month after booking their return to Wembley to face Liverpool. Chelsea were beaten in an epic penalty shootout by Jürgen Klopp’s team in the Carabao Cup final in February but they will get another shot at them after defeating Crystal Palace 2-0. Liverpool are still in contention for the quadruple, after reaching the last four of the Champions League, but Tuchel is confident Chelsea can push them all the way in their Wembley rematch. Tuchel said: “We lost the final but we gave everything in that. It was a big match that went to the very last penalty and we were unlucky. We lost it and we want to turn things around. “It won’t give us the Carabao Cup trophy back. But we are here and were in the FA Cup final last season and it means an unbelievable amount to us because it is the most prestigious cup in the world. It’s at Wembley and there are not a lot of bigger games to be part of it. “That’s why we are grateful and we will be well prepared because we will play against one of the strongest teams in the world that have outstanding form, so it will be a tough one but we will try to make life tough for them. “We want to be in every competition and to have this big final at the end of the season is massive. It gives you joy to have something waiting and we have another final. It gives us a lot of confidence and it is a big emotional boost. We are happy to have this final and we will give everything to be ready.” Chelsea suffered FA Cup final disappointment last season with their defeat to Leicester but Tuchel is focused on ending this campaign with silverware at Wembley. “We cannot promise and all we can do now is be well prepared because it will be another hard fight,” the German said. “The quality and form of Liverpool means it’s unbelievably difficult to beat them but this is what the Cup final’s about. It’s about winning and we need to try to find a way to beat them. We need a bit of luck and of course everything at the top level. “Of course it makes the season so much sweeter if you have at the end of the season a final you can win. But as we all know in a final, as we experienced, sometimes you give everything and it’s not enough. But we will try to find a way.” Chelsea struggled to break down Palace in the first half but goals from Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount ended their resistance after the break. Their performance never reached the spectacular heights of Tuesday’s win in vain away to Real Madrid but Tuchel was impressed with his team’s patience. Tuchel said: “It was very disciplined and solid. There were not the same spaces to exploit. We played very disciplined on the ball and they were very disciplined off the ball. It was not the most exciting game to watch but it was challenging to keep our focus up after a very demanding schedule and playing in Madrid. “It’s one of these games where you need to convert a half chance. It was hard to do more without taking crazy risks. There were not many other ways to play it. We controlled it and didn’t lose focus and patience.” Palace’s semi-final gameplan worked for more than an hour and they came closest to scoring in the first half. The manager, Patrick Vieira, said: “We tried to play our best but Chelsea were too good on the day. We tried to frustrate them and I think we managed to do it in the first half. “Big games like that against those kind of teams you need to take your chances. We didn’t score but we had those couple of situations where we didn’t always make the right decision. But I’m really proud of the team for their approach to the game. In the first half we were brilliant but couldn’t score that goal.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel says Chelsea will be ready for ‘outstanding’ Liverpool in FA Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/17/tuchel-says-chelsea-will-be-ready-for-outstanding-liverpool-in-fa-cup-final
4/18/2022,"It must be very strange to be Édouard Mendy, a goalkeeper who seems doomed never quite to be centre stage. And when the spotlight does fall on him, it often feels it’s from a strange angle, that he’s not really appreciated for what he’s best at. Goalkeepers perhaps struggle than other positions to be properly understood, but few seem as misunderstood as the Senegal international. In a very slightly different world, one in which Gianluigi Donnarumma had not made a vastly expensive move and saved crucial penalties in shootouts in the semi-final and final of Euro 2020, Mendy would have won a raft of goalkeeping awards last year. In a very slightly different world, he would have been seen as the hero of Chelsea’s FA Cup semi-final victory over Crystal Palace on Sunday . This could have been his redemption after the error in the first leg that cost Chelsea their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid. His low save to his left to keep out a Cheikhou Kouyaté volley nine minutes before half-time was stunning, but the impact was perhaps lost because Joachim Andersen’s follow-up, which cannoned back off a post, was immediately ruled offside. Kouyaté’s effort would have counted, but the dramatic impact of Mendy’s intervention was lost as the flag was raised. (Of course had Andersen scored, there would have been plenty lining up to say Mendy, even at full stretch, responding sharply to a snap-shot through a crowded box, should somehow have pushed the ball away from oncoming opponents.) You can make almost any case with hypotheticals, but imagine that save had come late in the game, when the score was still 1-0. Perhaps Mendy’s save would not quite have gone down as one of the great Wembley saves, a stop to rival Jim Montgomery from Peter Lorimer in 1973, David Seaman from Paul Peschisolido in 2003 or Kasper Schmeichel from Ben Chilwell last year, but he would have been hailed as a key figure. As it is, his save just joined the mulch of a largely indifferent first half. There were long spells before half-time of boilerplate superclub against mid-table football: the former probed too slowly to look really threatening, and the latter resisted, offering the occasional glimmer of a threat in the counter or from set-plays. After the drama of Saturday’s semi-final, it felt at times slightly anticlimactic, not helped by the curious lack of conspicuous enthusiasm from the Chelsea fans as they squinted into the late-afternoon sunshine. While Palace’s fans, for whom such occasions remain a novelty, sang and clapped and bounced and waved their flags and balloons in a blur of red and blue, the sense of weary familiarity at the other end was almost palpable: all that fuss about sanctions preventing the sale of tickets and the club didn’t even sell out their allocation. This, of course, is one of the many blights of the superclub era that was ushered in by Roman Abramovich’s takeover in 2003. That what should be events, days that previous generations would have recalled for a lifetime, become dully quotidian to the extent that Chelsea will face Liverpool in both domestic cup finals this season. That the new owners, whoever they may be, might not pump in £1.5bn as Abramovich did, that these days may not be so frequent in future, seems not yet entirely to have sunk in. Wembley has simply become part of Chelsea’s routine to the extent that they have become part of the pattern of Mendy not quite gaining appropriate recognition. Last time they were here, for the League Cup final seven weeks ago, Mendy made a series of fine saves and was probably Chelsea’s man of the match, only for his part in the narrative to be as a supporting actor to another Kepa Arrizabalaga penalty shootout drama (even when he was signed, for a paltry £22m from Rennes, it felt it was largely to be not-Kepa). As Arrizabalaga, who came on for Mendy at the end of extra time, let in 11 out of 11 Liverpool penalties and skied his own kick, the standard line to take seemed to be that taking off Mendy had been a desperate mistake. Perhaps Chelsea would have won had Mendy stayed on, perhaps his excellence during the game would have had a psychological impact. But the logic that he had just won a penalty shootout with Senegal in the Africa Cup of Nations final seemed flawed. Egypt’s two failures from the spot then were an effort blazed miles over and another scuffed into Mendy’s body. It’s possible Mohamed Abdelmonem and Mohanad Lasheen quailed before Mendy’s presence, but his penalty record suggests few had been so overawed before. Mendy has many qualities as a goalkeeper, but saving penalties is not high on the list. Nevertheless, he has since won another penalty shootout against Egypt, in a World Cup qualifying playoff. That drama, though, will be remembered, if it is remembered at all beyond the two countries involved, for Senegal fans’ industrial use of laser pens shone in the eyes of Mohamed Salah and others before Sadio Mané smashed home the winner. Yet were next month’s FA Cup final against Liverpool to go to a shootout, it seems very unlikely Mendy would again be removed for Arrizabalaga, even though that was a switch that worked in the Uefa Super Cup success against Villarreal. And it may be that the FA Cup final provides his moment. If any Chelsea player is due proper recognition before the uncertainty that follows the Abramovich era takes over, it is Mendy.",Sport/Football,Édouard Mendy deserves recognition in final knockings of Abramovich era | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/17/edouard-mendy-deserves-recognition-in-final-knockings-of-abramovich-era
