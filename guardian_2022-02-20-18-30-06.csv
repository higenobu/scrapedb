2/20/2022,"We’ve been reading a book called There’s A House Inside My Mummy each night before bedtime, a winsome tumble through the fact that people sometimes exist inside other people you know. I don’t mind this book’s approach because it is adorable, and a useful way of explaining the inexplicable miracle of human reproduction through metaphor. It’s useful for me to learn as I have a habit of being altogether too literal. ‘You can’t fit a baby in there,’ he says, patting his mum’s belly, ‘it’s too small, you would be sore!’ ‘It is, a bit,’ we tell him, which is something the book doesn’t really go into, but we feel it’s worth being honest about, particularly in light of all the new noises his mum is making as she makes her way around the house.  A lot of parenting involves explaining things in ways so simple that their strangeness is made new to yourself. I know this because, every night, I have to explain the importance of dental hygiene to a three-year-old, too. Teeth, I try to get across, are just external bones which erupt from the flesh of your mouth, one by one, like parasitic wasps. You didn’t ask for them, but now they’re here, and you must scrub and polish these bones every day or they will rot, fall out of your head and you might starve to death. This usually gets him scrubbing quite avidly, and more than once has caused him to state that he most definitely does not want his teeth to fall out. Welllllll, I say – at the risk of changing the terms and conditions quite unreasonably – in about 18 months, they’ll start randomly tumbling from your gums so they can be replaced with your adult teeth. This is good, though. This means you’re a big boy, for these teeth will be massive, my darling, the same size as Mummy and Daddy’s, even though your head being not even half the size as ours by the time the cycle has come through. Despite this lack of cranial real estate, you’ll get an extra 12 teeth on top of the 20 that will be replaced, because your body just has them knocking around. And I do mean knocking around, dear boy, since these 32 comically oversized adult’s teeth are already in your head, in all stages of development, lurking in every recess of your skull to emerge from a mouth you might presume to be prohibitively small to afford this process. If I were to x-ray your face, sweet child, we would see a clear snapshot of the full grisly complement of gnashers, crowding out every inch of your head like some sort of abominable HR Giger lithograph. Just like Mummy has a baby inside her tummy, you have an adult inside you, and it will begin bursting into life via a gory profusion of discarded enamel, just over a year from now. ‘Daddy,’ he says, as I tuck him in, feeling much the wiser about babies, teeth and the joys of life, ‘can you leave the light on, please?’ Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

2/20/2022,"Regardless of what unfolds in the coming days and weeks, the fact that Vladimir Putin is once again menacing and stalking the world stage requires those of us committed to peace to act. In the UK, that means getting our own house in order. Let there be no doubt: when it comes to tackling Russian aggression, the Labour party supports the UK government and our allies. Those who equivocate between the actions of Russia and Nato are misguided or worse. The unified approach of recent weeks has surprised the Kremlin precisely because it is so used to encountering division. Those divisions have contributed to decades of failure in dealing with Russia.  The Putin playbook is well known. He favours chaos over order, the fog of war over clear strategy. He takes a nihilistic, zero-sum approach to foreign policy. Illicit money and influence are used as a judo move that turns the openness and freedom of western democracies into weaknesses. Over almost 12 years of Tory government, the tendrils of the Kremlin have been allowed to wrap around the UK, turning London into the “money-laundering capital of the world”. A cottage industry has been created that directly and indirectly does the bidding of those linked to Putin. Last week, it was revealed that £1.5bn of UK property had been snapped up by Russians accused of corruption or linked to the Kremlin. They are not here for the weather: they see us as a soft touch, somewhere they can hide cash with few questions asked. The prime minister’s recent tough talk couldn’t even be described as closing the stable door after the horse has bolted: it’s more like musing on what a good idea having a door would be. In 2018, the Commons foreign affairs committee said that “reacting in an ad hoc way to the Kremlin’s behaviour has led to a disjointed approach” and that “the assets… support Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system”. Priti Patel was on that committee. It should not have taken nearly four years, the massing of more than 100,000 Russian soldiers and the threat of war for the Tories to act. While they have refused to take action, the Labour party has laid out a serious plan for weeding out corruption. It involves greater transparency over company ownership via reform of Companies House, strengthening resources and powers of law enforcement on money laundering, updating counter-espionage laws and creating a register of parliamentarians and peers on the boards of foreign companies. By backing it, the government could begin to undo Putin’s grip and restore Britain’s reputation. This seems like common sense. So why is it not happening? Perhaps the answer can be found in the Tory party’s accounts. By taking nearly £2m in donations since Boris Johnson took power in 2019, they have become just as hooked on Russian-linked money as any of the worm-tongued servicers of oligarchical wealth. It is welcome that the Tories are finally waking up to the dangers of Russian money. But it’s not long since the prime minister was selling himself off as a tennis partner in exchange for donations and David Cameron was giving credulous speeches in Moscow. The Conservative party and its MPs and associations should hand back all the money they took. It is the only way to show that their days of turning a blind eye to kleptocratic loot are over.

2/20/2022,"A businessman involved in arranging donations for Prince Charles’s charitable ventures has confirmed how a 30-minute meeting at Clarence House helped secure an honorary CBE for a Saudi billionaire, which is now at the centre of a police investigation. Michael Wynne-Parker, who acted as a middleman for donations for the Prince’s Foundation, attended a meeting in September 2014 with Royal aide Michael Fawcett. A key topic of the meeting was the ambition of securing an honour for the Saudi billionaire and charity donor Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz.  Wynne-Parker, 76, said he entered Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, by a rear entrance and was ushered into a small office for a meeting attended by Fawcett, then chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation. William Bortrick, a society fixer who was helping Mahfouz, and an official at Dumfries House, a historic country house in Scotland which is one of Prince Charles’s key projects, were also at the meeting. The agenda was forging the links between Mahfouz and Dumfries House, part of the Prince’s Foundation, according to notes of the meeting revealed last year by the Sunday Times. It was also a logistics meeting on how best to secure an honour for Mahfouz, who was a major donor for Dumfries House. Within six months, a nomination was submitted to the Foreign Office for the honorary award for a foreign national. In November 2016, Mahfouz was given the honour in a private investiture at Buckingham Palace. “It was amazing,” said Wynne-Parker. “I was shocked when I suddenly saw the reality later. They acted very quickly, as always is usual with Fawcett. I wasn’t surprised in one sense because of what seemed like Fawcett’s magical powers.” Clarence House has said Charles had no knowledge of allegations of offers of honours on the condition or basis that donations were made to his charitable projects. In August 2017, Fawcett wrote to an aide of Mahfouz offering to try to help him secure a knighthood and British citizenship, in addition to the award he had already received. The letter said the assistance was being offered “in light of the ongoing and most recent generosity of His Excellency”. The meeting at Clarence House, the subsequent arrangements around the awarding of the CBE and the offer to try to secure a knighthood are likely to form key parts of the investigation announced by the Metropolitan Police last week into alleged offences under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925. Wynne-Parker said there was a long tradition of charitable donors receiving honours. He said he was not aware and had no knowledge of Mahfouz being offered an honour on the condition of giving donations. He said: “There was nothing inherently wrong with what happened. If people have got spare cash and they want to give it to a charity and they get a gong, there’s nothing wrong with it.” Christopher Sallon QC, a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, said an offence would be committed under the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 where there was a formal agreement or an understanding between the parties that an honour would be provided in exchange for a donation. The maximum sentence under the act is two years’ imprisonment and/or a £500 fine. He said there was a high evidential bar for a successful prosecution. He said: “There must be an agreement or understanding between the parties or at least an attempt by one party to obtain a reward in exchange for an honour or an offer by another part to give such an award.” Norman Baker, the former Liberal Democrat MP, whose complaint in September last year triggered the police inquiry, said he considered there was a prima facie case to be investigated based on the August 2017 letter which was first revealed by the Mail on Sunday. He said: “The whole honours system now needs to be tightened up.” Fawcett resigned last year as chief executive of the Prince’s Foundation. An independent investigation commissioned by the charity found evidence that co-ordination took place between Fawcett and others regarding honours nominations. It said there was no evidence trustees were aware of these communications. The Prince’s Foundation said last week it was inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation, but it was reported that a source close to Prince Charles said he would be happy to help with the police investigation if asked.",News/UK news,Fixer tells of meeting with Prince Charles’s aide to discuss Saudi honour,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/fixer-tells-of-meeting-with-prince-charless-aide-to-discuss-saudi-honour
2/20/2022,"Boris Johnson has refused to say whether he would resign if fined by the police for breaking Covid laws at a series of alleged Downing Street parties. After handing back a questionnaire to the Metropolitan police, which is expected to defend his presence at some of the dozen events under investigation, the prime minister dodged a series of questions about the issue.  Asked if he would quit if Scotland Yard issued him with a fixed penalty notice worth at least £100, Johnson told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme: “I can’t comment about a process that is under way.” Previously, the prime minister has commented on specific events – including a “bring your own booze” garden party to which more than 100 Downing Street staff were invited. The gathering was held on 20 May 2020, when only two people from different households could meet outdoors socially distanced. Last month, Johnson denied any wrongdoing and claimed “technically” no rules were broken and that he thought it was a “work event”. However, he apologised for the “rage” people who had made “extraordinary sacrifices” during the pandemic felt because they believed “the rules were not being properly followed by the people who make the rules”. Asked by the BBC if he understood why people found his defence of the event implausible, Johnson said: “There is literally not a bean I can tell you about that.” About a dozen Conservative MPs have gone public with their concerns about Johnson’s conduct and the way in which he ran No 10 during the pandemic. However, more have expressed concerns in private about his leadership, and others are waiting for the Met inquiry to conclude and the publication of the full Sue Gray report before putting in a letter calling for Johnson to quit. Pressed on whether he was burying his head in the sand about the serious concerns his own MPs had about the parties, Johnson said: “I am fortunate to live in a democracy. I am fortunate to be the PM of a free independent democratic country where people can take that sort of decision, and where I do face that sort of pressure, that’s a wonderful thing.” The Met has not said how much longer its investigation – known as “Operation Hillman” – will take. Officers have started receiving back questionnaires sent to those – including Johnson – who it believed attended some of the dozen gatherings being investigated.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson refuses to say if he would quit if fined for breaking Covid laws,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/20/boris-johnson-refuses-to-say-if-he-would-quit-if-fined-for-breaking-covid-laws-party
2/20/2022,"It was one of the most audacious heists in Irish history when a 17-strong armed gang posing as police held up the night mail train at Sallins, County Kildare, snatching the equivalent in today’s money of £1m in cash. The IRA would later twice claim responsibility for the 1976 robbery but the lives of the three men wrongly convicted and sentenced to between nine and 12 years for a crime they did not commit were ruined.  Now one of those men, former journalist Osgur Breatnach, is threatening to go to the United Nations over allegations of confessions extracted through torture in one of Ireland’s worst miscarriages of justice. In a Dublin hotel, Breatnach tells of the toll the scandal has taken on his mental health, career and family. “I can’t find closure. I have tried,” he says. He leans in to give a blow-by-blow account of what he says happened in the station when he was first arrested by the Garda Síochána. “If you played blind man’s bluff as a child and you are spinning round and you don’t know a connection with what is around you, except my eyes were open. I was being hit all the time, being pushed against the lockers. I tried to get into a corner to defend myself and I couldn’t, so I thought ‘I’ll say I was there’ so the beatings stopped. “They gave me a pen but I was holding it like this,” he says, demonstrating how shaky his hand was. “I couldn’t hold the pen, so they threw me aside … and started all over again. “I was dizzy, had a roaring headache, sore all over, disoriented, terrified. Part of my mind is saying ‘they are going to kill me’. “By the time I was charged in the district court I had been detained eight times consecutively in a period of eight days, had been to two jails, two courts and hospital. It was just an avalanche.” Breatnach’s conviction was quashed in 1980 and he was awarded compensation after a civil action. But there has never been an inquiry into how confessions of guilt were extracted by gardaí or used as the sole basis of convictions by the courts. Breatnach has retained KRW Law, a high-profile Belfast legal firm at the forefront of challenges to the British state over killings during the Troubles. As part of a two-pronged campaign to get to the truth, KRW is threatening to report the Irish government to the UN Committee Against Torture (Uncat), a move that would be embarrassing for Ireland given it is a signatory to Uncat protocol. KRW is also working with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties on a potential petition to the Irish government. The prosecution put forward claims that Breatnach’s injuries were “self inflicted”, even though he had only been in the company of gardaí before signing his “confession”. The ICCL said there had been a “failure by successive Irish governments to examine” what happened and has called for an inquiry investigating breaches of the European convention on human rights. In its summary of Breatnach’s case, KRW cites comments by a respected, now deceased, judge, Mr Justice Adrian Hardiman, in 2007 that 20 years previously Ireland had been “gripped by the fate of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven” – a reference to notorious miscarriages of justice in relation to IRA bombings in the UK – but were not looking into similar injustices at home. “The fact is that, during the same time as these miscarriages of justice were unfolding, so too in Ireland was the Sallins mail train robbery case, which led to massive settlements and grave damage to the reputation of our policing and criminal justice systems. “But we have never, as a country or community, internalised the lessons of that event.” Litigation consultant Christopher Stanley of KRW branded the failure hypocritical. “For a western democracy to ignore such an allegation and fail to investigate it is an indictment of that democracy which would demand a similar investigation into similar practices in so-called rogue or failing states. That is hypocrisy. “The historic nature of the allegation, especially when it exposes a systemic practice of abuse, is not important. The fact that it was allowed to occur and no consequences ensued – such as the prosecution of the offenders – is what demands to be exposed even if those now in authority protest that it was a long time ago and we have moved on. “In the Sallins case we want those responsible – those surviving gardaí officers – compelled as witnesses. We will seek testimony from law officers and we will seek disclosure of all material held by the state. Those who suffered have a right to truth which to date has been denied to them.” A spokesperson for Irish minister for justice Helen McEntee said she was aware that incidents such as Sallins “cast a shadow over the trust” in the criminal justice and policing system. However, they said it was important to note “that these investigations happened several decades ago and the safeguards available then to those who were the subjects of investigation were very different to those in place now”, and “a new system of appeal based on miscarriage of justice” had been introduced as a result of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. “The available safeguards were further strengthened in the years that followed. Since 2015, An Garda Síochána has had a code of conduct. This is signed by all members and forms the core of their commitments in respect of behaviour and standards. The [Garda] commissioner is completely committed to upholding the highest standards in our policing service,” the spokesperson added.",News/World news,"Police tortured me, says man falsely jailed for train robbery",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/man-jailed-ireland-1976-sallins-train-robbery-claims-police-torture
2/20/2022,"The critics are unanimous: the British Museum’s new exhibition, The World of Stonehenge, is a triumph. As archaeologists, it’s wonderful for us to see the show achieve such plaudits. But the fact that the exhibition is once again sponsored by the oil and gas supermajor BP brings inevitable disquiet. Hundreds of our colleagues in archaeology, museums and the heritage sector have recently signed a letter asking the museum to end its relationship with BP. The signatories include senior curators and academics from across the UK and beyond. This is a decisive moment for the British Museum: its agreement with BP is due for renewal this year and its future hangs in the balance. BP has maintained a strategy of sponsoring cultural institutions for decades, as part of its heavy investment in public relations. It’s keen to convince the public – and our policymakers – that it can be trusted to manage the transition to net zero itself. But BP’s programme for “net zero by 2050” relies on massive use of unproved carbon capture technologies and implausible offsetting. The company is continuing to look for new sources of oil and gas, which the International Energy Agency has said cannot be exploited if net zero is to be achieved. BP’s plans also ignore its 20% stake in the Russian oil company Rosneft, which is launching a $134bn project to drill in the Arctic. BP’s activities jeopardise efforts to keep global heating within the 1.5C limit of the Paris climate agreement and avoid yet worse droughts, wildfires and sea level rise.  We don’t know exactly how much money BP provides to the British Museum, although it’s almost certainly less than 1% of the museum’s income. With 2021 profits of £9.5bn, this is small change for BP. But at a time of continuing underinvestment by the government, it’s an amount that matters to the British Museum. Through this relationship, BP associates its name with values of civilisation, curatorial care and scientific knowledge about the human past and present, even as it embraces policies and strategies that arguably conflict with all these ideals. But this is no relationship of equals. The British Museum has no power to influence BP’s decision-making or speak out against it. On the contrary, as a result of this arrangement, its senior personnel are often required to publicly defend BP’s track record. We’ve been here before, with debates during the 1980s and 1990s around tobacco and arms company sponsorship. Other potential sponsors exist. And we shouldn’t forget that BP benefits from UK tax breaks worth billions of pounds and has not paid corporation tax on its activities in the North Sea for the past three years, while receiving tax relief of almost £400m, money that could have been spent on supporting renewables or, for that matter, on museums and culture. Last year, with George Osborne’s appointment as the museum’s chair of trustees, these issues took a worrying new turn. In addition to his role as chair, Osborne is a partner at the boutique advisory firm Robey Warshaw, which counts BP among its major clients. If he does not clearly recuse himself from any future decisions on the relationship with BP, it is hard to see how a potential conflict of interest can be avoided. Recent investigations into decision-making processes at the British Museum by the campaign group Culture Unstained are worrying for all of us who care about the museum. They find that the chairman’s advisory group exists outside the regular governance structures of the museum, yet has high-level influence. We don’t know who its members are and its meetings are not minuted, but we do know that it enables ongoing contact between very senior corporate representatives, the chair and the director of the museum, Hartwig Fischer. The British Museum is embarking on an ambitious and very expensive renovation plan. There is much at stake here. Any further deal with BP risks undermining the museum’s reputation for years to come. The generation now in its youth takes a dim view of the fossil fuel industry and those who enable it. BP undoubtedly has cash to spare – but it comes with a price. The museum’s trustees have a legal duty to protect its reputation. We believe this includes a duty to ensure that any decision on sponsorship renewal is subject to oversight and due diligence, including an independent review of BP’s business practices and suitability as a patron. According to investigations by the group Art Not Oil, when the BP deal was renewed in 2016, it was the director of the museum who made the decision. It now seems imperative for the trustees to take a more active role. They will no doubt be considering why it is that most other major cultural institutions in the UK, including the RSC, Tate and the National Theatre, have renounced fossil fuel sponsorship. They will also be aware that this issue is not going away. On the contrary, highly creative protests against BP’s presence in the museum will continue and public opinion is increasingly in favour of taking strong action on climate change. The open letter signed by our colleagues suggests that professional opinion in the heritage sector has moved firmly in the same direction. Our understanding of humanity’s past matters for our future. The remains of our shared past, and how they are used, matter deeply for that future too. By continuing to accept fossil fuel sponsorship, the British Museum has become an outlier when it should be a leader within its sector. Its trustees now have a vital window of opportunity in which to defend the museum’s future and its reputation.

2/20/2022,"After a fistful of excellent Americana albums written in the fertile loam of New Orleans, Hurray for the Riff Raff’s Alynda Segarra has been evolving hard. The Navigator (2017) metabolised their Puerto Rican New York background for an album that slotted into that city’s lineage of lean, leather-jacketed songcraft. Life on Earth – Segarra’s eighth – finds them back in New Orleans, having brought some New York home. It confirms that no matter what’s going on underneath Segarra’s expressive, elastic voice, be it the startling 80s production of Pierced Arrows or the slinky electronics of Jupiter’s Dance, this is an artist with a kneejerk feel for classicism.  A brace of great tunes make the case: Rhododendron nods at Jonathan Richman’s Roadrunner, somehow making wildflowers sound gloriously disreputable. Saga, meanwhile, is a traumatised ballad that channels David Bowie, but with acoustic guitars and horns. Very different, but just as hard-hitting, is Precious Cargo, a breezy rap that recounts the journeys of brave people fetching up at the US border, to be met with violence. “It’s been a terrible news week,” Segarra sings at one point.

2/20/2022,"It started as a token of love, then went viral, and now it’s making people angry. If you noticed that “token”, “viral” and “angry” are all five-letter words, then the chances are you’re a devotee of Wordle, the online word puzzle that has become an internet craze. For those who have just returned from walking across the Sahel, Wordle is a game in which you have to guess, or work out, a five-letter word. Each day there is a new word. You can have six attempts, and each correct letter selected is awarded a yellow square. If it’s also in the correct place, it’s a green square. All other letters get a grey square.  Even if you don’t play the game, it’s hard to avoid its cultural imprint, as participants have taken to posting their results on social media – ubiquitous grids of grey, yellow and green squares, signifying a player’s line score. Brooklyn-based Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle – the puzzle is a play on his name – developed the game to entertain his partner during lockdown. Since he put it online back in October, it has drawn millions of users. Last month Wardle sold the puzzle to the New York Times for a sum said to be “in the low seven figures”. But all is not joy and happiness in the world of Wordle. Although the NYT, which mostly operates behind a paywall, has said the game will “initially remain free”, there is an expectation that advertisements or promotions may soon be added. For British players there has also been the issue of cultural imperialism, otherwise known as American spelling. There was a collective loss of a sense of humour recently when “humor” was the solution, just as Brits had earlier felt disfavoured when “favor” appeared. Then it emerged that the newspaper was removing words from the approved dictionary – you have to enter a recognised word on each line – that were deemed offensive, including “slave”, “lynch” and “wench”. The move was seen by some as a cryptically puritanical form of virtue signalling. After the NYT committed to cull “obscure” words, there were also fears voiced that it would make the game easier, followed shortly afterwards by the anxious concern that it would be made more difficult. Last week opinion swung towards the latter scenario when the new owners did not baulk (or “balk”, to use the spelling favoured by many purists) at using “caulk”, a five-letter word that inspired many players to utter four-letter words. Some took to social media to denounce the noun – it’s a kind of waterproof sealant – as something that only Bob the Builder would know. According to clinical psychologist Dr Patapia Tzotzoli, the appeal of Wordle is that it conforms to the theory of self-determination. “The theory suggests we can become self-determined when our three innate psychological needs – autonomy, competence and connection – are met,” she says. “Wordle enables autonomy because we choose to take a few minutes out of our day to play it. It offers competence because we can solve a puzzle and fare better than others. And in terms of connection, it fosters a sense of belonging to a wider community. It hits all the right notes to activate our motivation to keep going back.” But the more popular it becomes, the more complaints it provokes. The agitated talk of caulk followed immediately after the doubling-up crisis of the previous day. One of the appeals of Wordle is that everyone tackles the same word, at least within the English-speaking world – there are now versions in more than 90 languages. Players know that when they are struggling to get “knoll” or “siege” it’s a specific struggle shared with millions of others. This is the “connection”. But last week there was a sudden disconnect. Instead of a single answer, there were two: aroma and agora, depending on whether or not you were using the old or new URL. The NYT decided to drop agora because it was too arcane (excuse me, caulk?) and replace it with aroma, but some unrefreshed browsers got the original choice instead. Cue outrage of the kind more normally associated with gross infractions of the moral code, like flashing the Queen or swearing at David Attenborough. The judgment doing the rounds on Twitter was “scandal”. And many players felt that the one-word-a-day contract had been irrevocably broken. Things came to a head last week with a deceptively simple word: shake. That was exactly what many users were left doing with their heads. To complete the puzzle in four guesses seems to be the par score for Wordle. Doing it in three is a jolt of satisfaction, in two is smugly pleasurable, and in one is pure luck. But failing to do it within the allotted six is a wretched study in self-recrimination. That was the result for large numbers of players when they were lured into writing “shame”, “shape”, “shave”, “shade”, “shale” or “share”, but not “shake”. Disillusioned – or perhaps simply defeated – players began to announce that they were off to Quordle, a more taxing version of the game which involves completing four grids simultaneously. For the time being, however, the discontents are unlikely to dent the phenomenon that is Wordle. The question is whether, as we return to a more outgoing way of life, a game that was born under social restrictions will continue to flourish. “It’s in the nature of things to be impermanent,” says Tzotzoli, “and that’s true for people’s desires. We join a trend and then we move on to something else that is new and more exciting.” No doubt that’s the case, but just at this moment it’s difficult to imagine anything more exciting than five squares turning green – the most satisfying five-letter word of all.",Arts/Games,What in the world is happening to our beloved Wordle?  ,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/20/what-in-the-world-is-happening-to-our-beloved-wordle
2/20/2022,"In another age Christina Patterson’s Outside the Sky Is Blue would have been marketed as a misery memoir. It’s true that it’s the record of a life that has contained an uncommon amount of misery. But this book is a bracing, heart-lifting read, a narrative that consistently, courageously rises above the horrors it recounts. Patterson is a superb writer – part of the redemptive message of this memoir is that beautiful prose can make almost anything bearable – but she’s also clearly a pretty wonderful human being. On page after page, she’s hit with the kind of sucker punches that would floor most of us, and yet she comes back sparkling with humour, with love, with hope. Outside the Sky Is Blue is a lesson in generosity, in accommodation, but most of all it’s a lesson in resilience. Patterson’s story begins with the birth of her sister Caroline in Thailand. Her mother is Swedish, her father British and he has what promises to be a splendid diplomatic career ahead of him. Caroline is followed by Tom, and then Christina. By the time Christina is born, though, there are already signs that Caroline is troubled. Christina realises early on that her “skinny, sensitive, beautiful sister” is mentally ill, although the true extent of Caroline’s schizophrenia only becomes apparent when she is a teenager. Their father gives up his dreams of roving the world and settles down – grudgingly, we feel – to a job in the Treasury. Patterson reconstructs her childhood with a beautiful, sun-drenched nostalgia, summoning up holidays with her family in Sweden and a happy if shy existence in Guildford, drawing always on the rich store of her mother’s diaries and files. “My mother wanted to mark every moment of her life. She took photos of almost every meeting with a relative or friend.”  The trips to Sweden are a particular highlight: a delight at the time but also a rich store of happiness that the older Patterson is able to draw on in later, more challenging years. It’s not only that the holidays are glorious, it’s also that she is able to read within this strange landscape with its barns and islands and lingonberries the contradictions and disjunctures within her own personality. She is her mother’s daughter, you feel, even if she strives always for the approval of her father, who “rarely joins the cast of his family, but when he does, he has the air of a captain inspecting his troops”. The love the young Christina feels for her father is a complex, beautiful thing, the way she teases out his character a wonderfully subtle act of narrative control. One of the conceits in the book is the juxtaposition of Christina’s everyday problems – with boys, with her adolescent faith, with jobs – and the increasingly horrifying position of her sister, who is gaining weight and losing consciousness on a host of medications. The strain on the family is clear, and Christina’s increasing religious fundamentalism is merely one sign of the toll that Caroline’s illness is taking on them all. Patterson lifts the desperate sadness of these passages with tender humour, poking fun at her own po-faced forays into evangelism and recording her sister’s obsessive love of the Romanovs. Caroline’s trip to Russia with her parents will have you punching the air for her, even as you recognise that there is tragedy ahead. Patterson is brilliant on both physical and mental pain, and particularly on the linkages between the two. In one of the darkest passages in the book (and in her life), she is diagnosed with polyarthralgia, which, as she puts it, “really just means an awful lot of pain”. The pain is excruciating and without apparent cause, although the reader intuits that it is the physical manifestation of a deep unhappiness within. She goes to Sweden to join her parents on holiday and revisits the place where she was once so happy. “Back in the garden, staring out at the forest and listening to the grasshoppers, I wondered how someone who had so many friends, and such a loving family, could feel so alone.” Little does she know how much more tragedy there is to come; indeed it seems that what brings her out of her slump is the collapse of everything around her, the sense of a ship going down with Patterson the only survivor. Everyone Christina loves dies, and dies too young. She is covered in acne, contracts lupus, is poleaxed by her debilitating and unexplained pain. She is adored by her colleagues at the Poetry Society and the Independent, but the men in her life treat her terribly. Just when there’s a break in the clouds and you think things might be working out for her, she’s diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. And yet, despite it all, she survives, and more than that, she thrives. The final, joyful chapter looks forcefully ahead, ending with a wonderful passage of hope in the face of despair, a passage that feels like it is written just in case the reader feels any last shred of pity for her. She is on the verge of 60, and she is happy. “My cup runneth over,” she says. “I mean it. My cup runneth over. When the time comes, someone will have to wrest it [life] out of my hands.”  Outside the Sky Is Blue by Christina Patterson is published by Tinder Press (£16.99).

2/20/2022,"The youngest of the 18 dancers who make up Nederlands Dans Theater 2 is 20, the oldest is 26 – and every single one of them is utterly astonishing. Watching them move is just a pleasure, their fluid technique, elegant limbs and disciplined shapes fitting themselves to whatever choreography is thrown at them. Quite a lot is thrown at them in this triple bill, which makes you marvel at their adaptability as well. They begin the night flexing and shuddering in sharp staccato in the choreography of Marco Goecke’s The Big Crying, a knotty piece written in response to the death of his father. It casts its dancers in fierce, shadowy groups as they twitch and surge in constricted, contracted gestures that seem to mimic scenes from life, if only you could crack the code.  I suspect your reaction depends on how much you like Tori Amos, who provides the melancholy score, alongside a soundscape of roaring trains and the dancers’ screams. It’s very intense but it ends on a note of resolution, as bare-chested Emmitt Cawley sinks to the floor, stretching his body out of its tight-wound state and begins to dance to REM’s Losing My Religion, sung like a dirge. I am a sucker for all this sort of thing, and found myself both riveted and moved. It was nevertheless a relief to move on to the next piece, aptly called Simple Things and choreographed by the granddaddy of Netherlands dance, Hans Van Manen, now 89 and still a master of clear, clever dance-making. This piece is a 20-minute quartet that seems to be about nothing yet is full of something. Set to a mixture of accordion, modern piano and Haydn, and elegantly designed by Keso Dekker, it begins with two men – marvellous Cawley and the equally wondrous Auguste Palayer – dancing side by side with fluent joy, their arms and hands flicking in relaxed time to the music. Two women – Cassandra Martin and Kenedy Kallas, both lovely – enter and dance with them in turn, changing the mood, sweeping their legs across the stage in languorous turns or jumping like satyrs, feet tucked up high. The steps are elegant and classy; the entire piece, with its little hints of story, has an attractive openness and responds perfectly to its score. Johan Inger’s Impasse, which closes the evening, has a darker purpose but equal facility, expressing a deep idea incoherent dance form. It takes three innocent youngsters – Annika Verplancke, Austin Meiteen and Cawley – and sets them jumping across the expanse of their lives, holding hands, stretching their limbs with a sense of possibility. Through a door at the back of Inger’s own set, lit by Tom Visser, the world crowds in in the shape of an enticing group of dancers, at first in black and then like a wild cabaret. Sophisticated and sassy, this society demands the youngsters give up their freedom to conform, losing the space they have marked as their own. The choreography is a thrilling mixture of swagger and challenge. The dancers, as they do all night, hold the stage with utter and transfixing confidence.

2/20/2022,"What would the City of Light be without one of its Enlightenment luminaries? For 18 months concerned Parisians have missed a statue of philosopher and historian Voltaire, which disappeared from its plinth in August 2020 during a wave of statue-toppling around the world. Rumours spread that Voltaire – real name François-Marie Arouet – was a victim of “cancel culture”, removed by politically correct City Hall officials because, while he wrote denouncing slavery, he owed part of his fortune to colonial-era trade and has been accused of racism and antisemitism.  Rightwing commentators were outraged. Had the Paris authorities followed the example of the city’s Nazi occupiers, under whose regime the original bronze of Voltaire was removed in 1941 and melted down? Jean-Pierre Lecoq, mayor of Paris’s 6th arrondissement, said at the time: “I demand the return of Voltaire to the Square Honoré-Champion.” Now deputy Paris mayor Karen Taïeb, has said the statue will be back on a pedestal “some time this year”, adding that it was found to be in need of restoration, having been vandalised and damaged not only by the paint but by the elements. “It has now undergone a little cosmetic surgery in that we have redone the nose, which was almost eroded away,” Taïeb said. However, Voltaire will not return to his plinth close to the Seine’s left bank just behind the prestigious Académie des Beaux-Arts. Instead, the statue, by sculptor Léon-Ernest Drivier, will be placed under arches in the university medical school, half a mile away. “Taïeb said: “We thought about installing it on the Quai Voltaire, but the conservation people said no because it’s very polluted there.” “The experts say that if we leave it outside it will be damaged further; even the rain could lead to its deterioration.” She added that in the new site the statue would be protected from the elements but still visible to the public: “I can understand people being worried about the statue because it was removed at a time of a lot of news about statues. I don’t know if the motivations of those who damaged the statue were political, but our only motivation is conservation. The City of Light will continue to have its man of Enlightenment.” Neither the culture ministry nor Lecoq responded to questions. In 1878 a bronze statue of Voltaire was commissioned to mark the 100th anniversary of his death, and placed on Quai Malaquais. It was melted down during the second world war. The Drivier version was placed in Square Honoré Champion in 1962. Prof Matthew Fraser of the American University of Paris, whose forthcoming book Monumental Fury: The History of Iconoclasm and the Future of Our Past examines statue toppling, said: “It’s sad to see Voltaire moved … the statue was placed there for a reason: Voltaire died nearby on what is now Quai Voltaire. Also, it was only a few dozen yards from the original bronze statue that was demolished and melted down by the Nazis, who despised Voltaire for his Enlightenment ideals.” French president Emmanuel Macron has said France will not be toppling any historical statues. “The Republic won’t erase any name from its history,” he said in June 2020. “We should look at all of our history together with lucidity.”",News/World news,Où est Voltaire?

2/20/2022,"Serial is one of the most downloaded podcasts in the world. Its first season, a true-crime whodunnit that became an instant hit had me hooked on its release eight years ago. So I was excited to tune into its new offering with the New York Times, The Trojan Horse Affair, an eight-part series that promises to tell the real story of the anonymous letter sent to Birmingham city council in 2013, that alleged a plot to take over and run local state schools according to strict Islamist principles. But this latest series skewers the art of narrative journalism Serial is widely considered to have pioneered. Long-form podcasts have more blockbuster potential than straight-up reporting, but are laced with danger: the temptation to cherry-pick facts in service of a gripping story.  The Trojan Horse Affair presents a one-sided account that minimises child protection concerns, misogyny and homophobia in order to exonerate the podcast’s hero, a man called Tahir Alam. In doing so, it breaches the standards the public have the right to expect of journalists, with cruel consequences for those it uses and abuses along the way. What happened in Birmingham in 2014 is a story of two parts. Part one involves the anonymous letter that was quickly established as a hoax, and how it got caught up in an intra-Whitehall fight between the then-education and home secretaries, Michael Gove and Theresa May. Gove held it up as evidence that violent extremism was blossoming unchecked by the Home Office; May claimed the issues later uncovered were a product of Gove’s academy reforms, which removed schools from the oversight of local councils and put them in the hands of privately run trusts. Part two is the story of what was subsequently uncovered by several Ofsted reports, an Education Funding Agency review, two separate inquiries by the Department for Education and Birmingham council, and multiple court judgments. There was no organised plot. But according to these bodies, a small cluster of Birmingham schools, including three run by an academy trust chaired by Alam, suffered from a range of issues: poor governance, including a lack of child protection safeguards; people in leadership positions who espoused or failed to challenge extremist views; cultures in which homophobia and misogyny, including from teachers, were allowed to flourish and young people were encouraged to become intolerant of diversity. At one school, pupils were taught creationism as science and, in one sex education lesson, that a woman cannot refuse her husband sex. Teachers made homophobic comments on a shared Whatsapp group; one referred to gay people as “animals” and “satanic”. At the same school, speakers with extremist views were invited to address assemblies. Alam, the most prominent of the small group of socially conservative men identified as being at the heart of the affair, has fought back, alleging the various bodies that made these findings were driven by Islamophobia. He is right that the way some in government and the media seemed to obsess about finding violent extremism where there was none was deeply unsavoury. The letter was indeed used as justification to drive controversial reforms in counter-terrorism policy. But his claim that multiple agencies and individuals exaggerated their findings for nefarious reasons has been dismissed as conspiracy thinking by the courts. (Alam told me, “not a single actual child protection or safeguarding issue has been cited in any of the reports ”.) That has not stopped Serial’s presenter duo running with a similar story. One half of it, a Muslim journalist from Birmingham called Hamza Syed is explicit about his mission from the beginning: he wants to prove his suspicion that a female Muslim headteacher wrote the Trojan letter for her own parochial reasons, because he thinks it would show “everything that comes after doesn’t matter”. The podcasters resolutely fail in this, but that doesn’t stop them accusing her of playing “racist judo” by faking resignation letters from Muslim members of her staff, a claim dismissed as false by an employment tribunal judge. They doorstep her at work to try to get her to talk, even though by that point she has seen a letter from Syed declaring he thinks she is lying. Syed and his American co-presenter Brian Reed also try to discredit the findings about what went on in the schools Alam was responsible for, including the misogyny and homophobia they tellingly lump into a “grab bag of Islam-adjacent allegations”. Reed secured an interview with two whistleblowers independently assessed as “credible” and “fair”. They understood it would be a general conversation about their experiences. Instead, Reed and Syed subjected them to a seven-hour interrogation on their testimony that they have described in a complaint to the New York Times as “torture”, leaving them feeling “beaten into submission, held hostage in our own home”. Even though Reed and Syed later concede the accuracy of the female whistleblowers’ account – that pupils were taught that wives cannot refuse their husbands sex – the journalists use three sources to try to undermine other aspects of the women’s testimony. But they fail to reveal pertinent information about the sources which raises serious questions about their credibility. And the whistleblowers are named in the podcast, even though they had understood they would be contributing anonymously. Next, Reed and Syed head to the offices of Humanists UK, which acted as liaison for these whistleblowers. They question Richy Thompson, a director, on how Humanists UK verified the whistleblower accounts before publishing them on its website. Thompson had no forewarning of the forensic questions about events that happened years ago, and was hazy on detail in the interview, but the Observer has seen correspondence in which he made clear to the presenters before the podcast aired that the Humanists independently corroborated the whistleblower accounts with other sources before publication. Yet the presenters allege they published the claims without checking them. The impression listeners are left with is that both the whistleblowers and the Humanists were motivated by Islamophobia, and so we should ignore what they have to say. Never mind the fact that the several inquiries into Trojan Horse draw on a multitude of other whistleblowers, including Muslim women. (The Humanists have also exposed the teaching of creationism in orthodox Jewish schools and issues with sex education in Catholic schools .) This grossly understates the risks children were exposed to, with real consequences. One teacher implicated in the sex education lesson was later convicted for sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl he referred to as his “wife”. Powerful men and institutions are adept at throwing around accusations of racism or anti-faith bigotry to undermine the credibility of people speaking up about child protection: see the treatment of those who tried to flag child sexual abuse in the Catholic church, or the Rotherham inquiry’s finding that nervousness about cultural sensitivities impeded the exposure of child sexual abuse by predominantly Asian grooming gangs. The kindest interpretation here is that Syed and Reed are reporting a story about child protection without knowing the first thing about it. How else to make sense of their indignation that the government wheeled out no child witnesses in the relevant teacher disciplinary hearings? Another thing Syed and Reed appear to have little understanding of is the personal costs involved in whistleblowing. A DfE official who visited one of the schools said she had never seen so many distressed, frightened and crying members of staff. A female Muslim whistleblower told me about the abuse and intimidation she has faced as a result of speaking out. Shaista Gohir, chair of the Birmingham-based Muslim Women’s Network UK, was approached by Muslim females from these schools and articulated their concerns at the time. It led to people threatening to harm her children. The silencing of Asian women trying to call out the sexism of certain Asian men is a common theme that comes up when I write about these issues. “The issue is not just how Muslims are treated by other people, but how Muslim women and girls are being treated by men in their own community,” Gohir told me. “Being accused of stoking up Islamophobia is the price I pay for raising concerns about child safeguarding and misogyny.” The idea that conservative men like Tahir Alam represent British Islam is plain wrong: surveys show the majority of British Muslims reject the ultra-conservative form of Islam that was found to be influencing these non-faith state schools. Conflating the defence of Alam with the defence of Islam does no one any favours. Syed’s apparent determination to make the facts fit his precooked narrative is paired with Reed’s meditations on race, which seem to use Syed’s experience of racism to excuse his questionable approach to journalism: the soft bigotry of low expectations. The New York Times/Serial told the Observer that it had considered complaints received from the whistleblowers and Richy Thompson and had concluded the podcast fairly and accurately represented the contents of their interviews and that Hamza and Syed have produced “the most comprehensive account to date of a matter of huge national importance and debate”. Ultimately, one false narrative – that there was a problem of violent extremism in these schools – is never improved by another: that beyond Islamophobia there was nothing much to see here at all. As journalists, our work has real-world consequences beyond the entertainment value of a gripping story. By all accounts, these communities have been healing and the schools recovering, but the people I spoke to fear this podcast series will reopen old wounds and sow new divisions. The New York Times owes them an apology.",Opinion/Opinion,The Trojan Horse Affair: how Serial podcast got it so wrong,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/the-trojan-horse-affair-how-serial-podcast-got-it-so-wrong
