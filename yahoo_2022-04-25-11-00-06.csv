4/25/2022,"LOUISVILLE, Georgia—It may have taken Gov. Brian Kemp a good half-hour to get there, but during his speech at a recent campaign stop in this small east Georgia town, he allowed himself to acknowledge the truth about the state of his Republican primary contest against former Sen. David Perdue. “I know some are getting a little confident,” Kemp said. “Which worries me.” Laughs rang out from the room, which was packed with local luminaries and Kemp supporters tucking into sliced ham and bright pink cake, courtesy of the governor. Not too long ago, however, there was little in this race for Kemp to laugh about. In December, Perdue launched a campaign to primary him—backed by the full might of Donald Trump—based almost entirely on the governor’s refusal to illegally overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 win in Georgia. With the MAGA grassroots still fired up about election fraud conspiracies, Georgia Republicans braced for a brutal cage match between two of their most high-profile politicians. A Kemp loss was seen as possible. A bruised GOP nominee heading into the general election against Democrat Stacey Abrams was seen as a certainty. Now, as the May 24 primary draws near, this Republican battle royale has turned out to be as bitterly personal as expected. That much was clear at a debate between the two men on Sunday night, which ended up being a bare-knuckled brawl over the 2020 election. Perdue blamed Kemp for his and Trump’s losses—and Kemp called him “weak” for trying to avoid accountability for his humiliating loss. What wasn’t expected, however, is what Kemp carefully alluded to in Louisville: the possibility that Perdue’s much-hyped challenge fizzles out in embarrassment. Not a single public poll of the primary has found Perdue leading Kemp; one recent survey even showed the governor ahead by 24 points. Meanwhile, the Georgia GOP establishment has largely rallied around Kemp, as have legions of rank-and-file types. Kemp has badly outraised Perdue, and his ads attacking the ex-senator are omnipresent on TV screens across the state. Trump, already seeking to manage expectations, has publicly suggested Perdue—a former senator and Fortune 500 CEO—is a “long shot.” Even if he’s willing to acknowledge his advantage over Perdue with a self-deprecating joke, Kemp is nothing but sober and serious when discussing the rest of the primary campaign. If he doesn’t get more than 50 percent of the vote in May, the two Republicans will go head-to-head in a June runoff. In that scenario, anything can happen—so much so that in Georgia, local politicos often joke that the first-place spot is “cursed” in a runoff. Just ask Perdue, who lost to Democrat Jon Ossoff in a 2021 runoff after leading him by over 80,000 votes after the 2020 general election. Or ask Kemp, who finished a distant second in the GOP primary for governor in 2018 before winning in the runoff. “We’ve got to run like we’re 10 points down, and win by 10,” Kemp told the crowd in Louisville. “That’s what we’re doing.” Kemp’s biggest advantage right now may be that Republicans in Georgia care more about what he has done on a number of issues—not what he didn’t do on the only issue that seems to matter to Trump. At a campaign stop in Sandersville on a recent Thursday, Brant Kennedy, a minister, held up a pro-Kemp sign as the governor ticked through his actions on a number of conservative priorities, from guns and taxes to police and agriculture policy. Like most Trump supporters, Kennedy is upset about the 2020 election. He’s supporting Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), who is challenging Brad Raffensperger, the GOP Secretary of State who became a villain simply for defending the state’s election system. But Kennedy saw no reason for Perdue to run against Kemp—and said he wanted to “put a sock” in Trump’s mouth for continuing to bash Kemp and boost Perdue. “Brian Kemp hasn’t been a good governor,” Kennedy argued. “He’s been a great governor.” If Kemp successfully vanquishes Perdue, the win might have implications that extend far beyond this spring’s primary, which has become a litmus test for the future of the GOP. For one, it shows that even the most devoted Republicans simply aren’t making decisions based on Trump’s endorsements or his fixation on the 2020 election—a potential boon to Republican leaders who have been urging candidates nationwide to focus on Democrats’ handling of the economy and COVID instead. Beyond that, Kemp’s durability could affect Democrats’ chances of putting Abrams in the governor’s mansion next year. Democrats had been banking on running against a GOP nominee weakened by the Trump-fueled primary fracas—perhaps one of their few advantages in what will otherwise be a difficult election-year environment for the party. Even though Trump’s attempt to upend the Georgia GOP is falling flat, Georgia Democrats still believe the expensive, messy internal brawl will ultimately help Abrams. Max Flugrath, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Georgia, said Kemp is “facing an onslaught of brutal attacks” from Perdue and, in “fighting for his political life,” has embraced “extreme and unpopular” positions. “The intensifying GOP infighting and four-candidate field is fueling Trump’s efforts to force Kemp into a runoff,” said Flugrath, noting that the national Republican Governors Association has spent heavily to protect Kemp. Many Republicans are well aware that the more time and money they spend fighting, the better chance Democrats will have. If Abrams goes on to win in November, Kennedy, the Kemp-supporting minister, said he’d put the blame squarely on one person: “President Trump.” The Pastor Who Won’t Give In to Georgia’s New Voting Restrictions Trump’s inability to let go of his grudge against Kemp was on full display Thursday, when he released a bitterly angry statement attacking the governor for, among other things, not doing enough to protect Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA). The MAGA acolyte is facing an effort in court to disqualify her from the ballot. Trump closed by saying that Kemp “will never be able to win the general election” because Republicans “just will not vote for him.” This statement was just the latest in a slew of broadsides from the ex-president, who has never forgiven Kemp for declining to overturn the 2020 election in his state. Kemp, however, has opted to keep Trump’s name out of his mouth. The day before Kemp toured east Georgia on his campaign bus, news broke that a TV ad offensive against Kemp had been funded by Trump, to the tune of $500,000. Asked by The Daily Beast to respond, the governor did not mention the ex-president’s name. “We can’t control that,” Kemp said of Trump’s funding of attacks. “I'm not worried about what other people are doing.” On the stump, Kemp also avoids mentioning Perdue by name, preferring to take veiled shots that resonate most with local audiences. For example, Kemp repeatedly referenced Perdue’s recent comments that the Georgia State Patrol is “not elite,” which outraged some Republicans and members of law enforcement. In Louisville, Kemp said the State Patrol’s critics—not naming Perdue—“just don't know what they're talking about. They're not in today's world. They're throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks.” Instead, Kemp has remained focused on his record as governor with the urgency of someone convinced that his policy accomplishments are his best asset in this tough campaign—even if his plodding determination to get through every last item means he sometimes loses a crowd. At a restaurant on Louisville’s quiet, historic Broad Street, roughly 80 attendees listened as Kemp methodically went through his wins from the just-concluded state legislative session. Within 30 minutes, the governor covered legislation on mental health, reworking the state’s elections, K-12 education, the state income tax, farming, law enforcement, human trafficking, and more. Democrats are convinced that several of these bills will be politically toxic in the general election—such as one to allow permit-free carrying of firearms in public—but they’ve shored up Kemp’s status in the GOP base. GOP state senator Max Burns, who introduced the governor to the crowd, boiled down Kemp’s message in a brief interview with The Daily Beast. “If you want to argue with Brian Kemp’s record, tell me what he’s done wrong?” Burns said. “I don’t have a thing against David Perdue. He’s not the guy.” Indeed, Kemp’s pitch is an intentionally Georgia-focused antidote to Perdue’s campaign, which is animated almost solely on the issue of election fraud and Trump’s focus on the 2020 election. An ad from Perdue—which began running on Friday and was funded by pro-Trump forces—tried to tie virtually all the country’s current problems to Kemp, by making the false claim that he “sold us out and allowed radicals to steal the election.” Republicans had already noted the former senator’s struggle to refocus on other issues, as it becomes clear that GOP voters largely aren’t willing to ditch Kemp over his handling of the past election. “David Perdue seems to be caught in the past, without a plan,” said Jason Shepherd, the former chairman of the GOP in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta. “His campaign is trying to run to the right of the most conservative Republican governor that Georgia has ever had.” That has prompted Perdue to pick some unusual fights. When the electric vehicle company Rivian decided to invest billions of dollars for a new plant in Georgia, Perdue criticized Kemp for allegedly not listening to the concerns of residents near the proposed site. He’s also tried to cast suspicion in the GOP on the entire project by noting that liberal financier George Soros is a Rivian investor. GA Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger Details Trump’s ‘Threats’ Charles Bullock, a longtime professor of politics at the University of Georgia, said this line of attack “smacked almost of desperation.” The weakness of Perdue’s 2020 election-focused pitch, Bullock says, has “forced Perdue to take counter-Republican positions… most folks in Georgia, generally, are in favor of things that are going to bring jobs.” There is one individual who Kemp is glad to mention by name, repeatedly, at every stop: Abrams. Though she lost to Kemp in 2018, Abrams’ work registering voters in that race and in 2020 is credited as being integral to recent Democratic wins in Georgia. And now she is running for governor again. While Perdue’s campaign materials put Abrams front and center, Kemp—though he insists on not taking the primary for granted—is also running ads dinging Abrams. In Louisville, Kemp acknowledged he is “definitely” running two campaigns at the same time. “ “We have got to win the primary,” Kemp said. “And I have the record to do that, but I also have a record to beat Stacey Abrams in November, and look, primary voters need to understand that— they need to understand that I'm the candidate that can beat Stacey Abrams.” But Republicans stress that they will support whichever Republican is taking on Abrams. Several said they believe Perdue to be a weaker candidate, pointing to his loss to Ossoff and reporting on his stock trading activity by The Daily Beast and other outlets. Recent polling of the race has backed up that sentiment, with Kemp faring better than Perdue in hypothetical head-to-heads with Abrams—though both would have an advantage over the Democrat. With such a ripe midterm environment shaping up for the GOP, virtually every Republican who spoke to The Daily Beast expressed dismay that this primary is even happening. Mitch Sheppard, a self-described “conservative Republican” who is in the trucking business, came out to see Kemp in Sandersville last week. He said he was “a little disappointed” that Perdue decided to run. “The focus right now should be on defeating Democrats. I’d rather not go through a primary,” Sheppard said. “I personally think the Trump effect has gone away for a lot of people.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Got a tip?

Xandria also mentioned that many of her clients pursue cuddle therapy in addition to seeing a therapist. Xandria typically works in a ""cuddle studio"" that concentrates on creating a relaxing environment by including things like aromatherapy and ambient lighting. Clients are also offered the opportunity to talk during the cuddle session.  Xandria said, ""Once we start cuddling, it can vary greatly. Some clients want to talk in a more casual, friendly way, some treat it more like therapy and vent."" Additionally, Xandria explained that some clients prefer to cuddle in silence, while others ask to watch a movie instead.  Some of my clients struggle to ask for what they want in a session. They feel guilty or like they’re being a burden on me. They have been told that touches bad and they are so afraid of crossing lines or being rejected that they are afraid to ask for what they want in a session. #AFairShotWithBlock #SmellLikeIrishSpring #GameTok #cuddletherapy #cuddlist #cuddletherapist #touch #consent Like all forms of therapy, Xandria makes sure that boundaries are established and understood before the session begins to ensure the comfort of herself and the client.

Xandria said, ""Consent is never implicit, but boundaries are, and decorum is maintained throughout the session. I address these in my pre-screening but also verbally as we work together."" She also noted, ""At the end of the day, both parties feel safe enough to ask for what they want while also saying and hearing the word 'no.' Cuddle therapy is therapy, it is not something else, and that is explicit.""

4/25/2022,"The Facebook post from last Saturday is comedy gold. A man in a DeSantis 2020 hat topped with a mouse-ear headband poses in front of a few cars with their hoods up. The caption: “Patriot Convoy just did a BLOCKADE @ the Entrance of Disney. Car Trouble. No one visiting Disney can get in.” A few people took the man seriously, scolding him for spoiling family vacations. Others realized, almost immediately, that the “blockade” was on a back-property access road near the Disney Springs shopping complex. A few miles away, folks were getting in and out of Disney theme parks just fine. The man, and the small group of people he convinced to follow him, looked silly. The gajillion-dollar corporation they were trying to harass looked oblivious. That vignette might have been a little preview of the ridiculous exhibition Gov. Ron DeSantis himself led a few days later. With no advance notice, DeSantis demanded that lawmakers punish Disney for its tepid criticism of a hateful bill aimed at banning discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in Florida classrooms (also, for Disney’s threat to cut off campaign contributions). But when the governor roared, the Mouse yawned. The company with nearly 40 registered lobbyists didn’t send a soul to indecently rushed committee meetings convened to dole out punishment. And as the dust settles, many suspect that Disney’s “punishment” could let the company pocket tens of millions of dollars each year and shift a billion-dollar debt onto the shoulders of local taxpayers. That would leave DeSantis and lawmakers looking as foolish as those “Patriot Convoy” blockaders, responsible for one of the biggest financial blunders in Florida’s history DeSantis targeted two favors: One, a provision that exempts Disney from a law meant to annoy social-media companies, was only notable for the way DeSantis and lawmakers eagerly scampered to protect Disney in the 2021 session, only to childishly yank back the carve-out in 2022. But the other seemed like a really big deal. Lawmakers passed a bill (SB 4C) that abolishes a key component of Disney’s successful 50-year run in Florida. Disney, as it turns out, has its own government. In fact, it has three: Two cities — Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, combined population a little more than 50 — and the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which wraps around Disney’s iconic theme parks and resorts along with thousands of vacant acres in Orange and Osceola counties. Reedy Creek was created by the Legislature in 1967, soon after Disney announced its Florida venture. Since then, many — including this newspaper — have questioned whether it was a good idea to give Disney so much power, most of which is wielded through the Reedy Creek district. We’d welcome a thoughtful review of the district’s powers and operations. That’s not what this is. Even the lawmakers sponsoring the legislation couldn’t say exactly how it would work. There’s a lot to consider. Reedy Creek issues Disney’s permits, operates its utilities including water, sewer and electric; and levies a hefty property tax that pays for the services Disney needs. That last one might seem outrageous. The Reedy Creek district covers 25,000 acres, and collected $164 million in property taxes in 2022. That’s a lot of money for a private corporation to seize, under the power of government. But who is Disney taking that money from? At it turns out: Disney. Disney and its affiliates contribute 87 percent of the district’s tax revenue. That makes sense, says Professor Rick Foglesong of Rollins College, who wrote “Married to the Mouse,” a political history of Disney’s creation. When the Reedy Creek district was created, it wasn’t really about money: Walt Disney and other executives were sick of bending to the whims of city officials in Anaheim, California as they built and operated Disneyland. “They wanted a government that was tailored to their precise needs,” he said. For 55 years, the Reedy Creek district has been operating as intended. Today it employs nearly 400 people, more than half of them firefighters. It also has a surprisingly large permitting operation, including the kind of building inspectors who are comfortable signing off on the structural integrity of a 5.7 million gallon fish tank or a restaurant with a giant singing tree in the middle. That built-for-Disney government is what DeSantis ordered his pet legislators to destroy. Under HB 4C, the Reedy Creek Improvement District will go bibbity-bobbity-boom in June 2023. The bill was designed to create chaos — and it did. It was also probably intended to distract attention from lawmakers’ other task: Kowtow to DeSantis’ demands and pass a shockingly racist plan to redraw the state’s congressional districts. It did that too. But after a few days poking around, this bill doesn’t look nearly as disastrous for Disney as DeSantis intended. Start with that $164 million in property taxes, which funds most of the district’s $178 million operating budget. If the district goes away, so does its taxing authority. Who picks up the tab? That’s really not clear. Rep. Randy Fine, R-Palm Bay and House sponsor of the spank-Disney legislation, theorized that most of the district’s responsibilities and assets might, maybe, possibly, trickle down to the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista. Which are still controlled by Disney, and have taxing authority. But that leaves thousands of acres outside those two cities’ limits. In that case, a portion of the burden will fall on Osceola County, but most of it will land on Orange County. Assuming those costs could be disastrous, County Mayor Jerry Demings told the Sentinel. Then there’s the Reedy Creek district’s debt, which we estimate at $977 million, with about $100 million more in liabilities for the district’s pension program and other promised benefits. That’s a lot. Who’s responsible for paying it? Fine guessed the counties might be responsible — but bond documents suggest the state itself could be held responsible for triggering default. Remember, all this — the annual budget, the debt, the building inspectors and firefighters (and their pensions) were designed to be covered by Disney’s tax payments. Taxes that, after June 2023, nobody will have the authority to collect. Lawmakers dangled the possibility of re-authorizing the district in 2023. It seems unlikely that Disney is going to wait 10 months for the opportunity to beg lawmakers to relents. The company has options: Greatly expanding the boundaries of the cities it controls, or striking a local deal with Orange and Osceola counties. Either option would be more tamper-resistant to hot-headed lawmakers. The entire sorry saga puts us in mind of another story — from a film banished from Disney’s back catalog because of racist elements, something DeSantis would probably sneer at as “woke.” It’s the tale of a foul-tempered fox who thought he had the upper hand on a wily rabbit, only to find himself outsmarted when the hare made a thorny escape. That inspires a suggestion: If Disney and local leaders decide to build a solution to the mess DeSantis and legislators created, they can leave the Reedy Creek name behind. The Briar Patch Improvement District? We can see that. ____ The Orlando Sentinel Editorial Board consists of Opinion Editor Krys Fluker, Editor-in-Chief Julie Anderson, Viewpoints Editor Jay Reddick and El Sentinel Editor Jennifer A.
