5/16/2022,"Friday's mini-rally notwithstanding, it’s getting ugly out there as my former CNN colleague Jack Cafferty used to say. You’ve seen the numbers and they aren’t pretty: Worst start for a year for stocks since 1939. Big tech companies have lost trillions of dollars of market value. Looking at your portfolio is like a kick in the gut. The carnage is not equally distributed, though. While the Dow (^DJI) is down 11% year to date, (the market peaked on Jan. 3 — conveniently the first trading day of the year), the tech-heavy NASDAQ (^IXIC) is off a bone-crushing 25%. As if that’s not bad enough, stay-at-home and meme stocks, SPACS and oh my lord, crypto are worse. Examples: Peloton (PTON) was off 60% at one point, SPACS are down 43% on average, and Bitcoin has fallen some 55% from its November peak.) That means there’s some method to the madness. Risky bets are getting pounded the most. How many of us bought those glittering objects, only to get burned? Conversely, how many of us rushed out to buy Dow components Chevron, Honeywell or P&G? The former is up 43% year-to-date (Warren Buffett picked up some), and while HON and PG are down year to date, it’s only by single digits. But no, we had to fly high. And now we’re falling hard. Speaking of Buffett, I have to laugh at just how classic this turn of events has been for him and Berkshire shareholders. As I recently noted, as with countless bubbles and manias past, Berkshire trailed the market, causing another generation of naysayers to insist Buffett had lost his investing touch. Not! A brief recap of why the market is taking it on the chin: The persistent COVID pandemic, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, plus the rise of nationalism and decline of globalism, all of which is torturing supply chains and driving up inflation. Meanwhile, the Fed is raising rates and reducing its portfolio to prevent the economy from overheating. I’m not saying all of that is going to be bad for the stock market forever, but at the very least this new environment will favor a different group of stocks, like oil and gas producers, and companies that produce and sell in the U.S., for instance. One emblematic signal from this week: Saudi Aramco has surpassed Apple as the world’s most valuable company. “As the Fed raises rates, there's been a lot of concerns around even if the base case is not for a recession in 2022, what does it look like beyond, in 2023 and beyond,” asks Sonali Pier, PIMCO managing director and portfolio manager. “And that's really why we're seeing some investors pivot from cyclicals into non-cyclicals, and really getting concerned about companies where they have lower margin businesses, and that will find it difficult to be squeezed by inflation. And as a result, you can see that there's been a preference for defensive names.” “We were over-risked through most of 2020, and 2021,” Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy for Wells Fargo, tells Yahoo Finance. “And we pulled back on our risk so far this year. We're getting more conservative within equities in terms of our asset class allocation, and our geography. We're tilting towards the U.S. We're tilting towards large- and mid-caps and away from smalls.” Returning to Putin for a second, it just makes sense to go risk-off, as they say on Wall Street, and hunker down when you have an unhinged autocrat with nukes hinting at World War Three. Who wants to be all giddy with growth stocks given that? I understand this thing could turn around on a dime and maybe Friday was the beginning of that. But say it doesn’t. Will this market meltdown and surge in inflation cause a recession? Not necessarily. All kinds of unfortunate events like stock swoons and rising prices, as well oil price shocks and, (as we’ve seen), pandemics can cause recessions. But it’s not inevitable. For instance, neither the flash crash of 2010, nor the bear market of August 2011, nor the market sell-off of August 2015, nor the 19.73% market decline in the fall of 2018 precipitated a recession. The closest corollary to our recent quandary might be the 2000 tech bubble bursting and the subsequent recession of March 2001 to November 2001. As noted, stock market crashes often don’t have enough systemic impact to crater the whole economy, but the 2000 blow-up did. And of course that recession was exacerbated by the attacks of 9/11. But we probably have even more serious exogenous factors this time around (COVID, Putin, supply chain issues and inflation.) All that plus a losing market are more than enough to cause the global economy to contract. Regardless, it’s likely we will see some reckonings in this unhappy season. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF rebounded strongly Friday but is still down 54% this year and was recently off more than 75% from its high in February 2021. Wood’s recent inflows however have been strong reportedly, and lately she was snapping up depressed shares of Coinbase (COIN). Then there’s Tiger Global, which has reportedly been hit by $17 billion in losses year to date, erasing about two-thirds of its gains since its launch in 2001. According to the FT other funds, like Coatue Management, run by so-called Tiger Cubs, (fund managers who once worked for Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management) are reportedly also being battered as they had larded up on stay-at-home names like Peloton and Zoom (ZM). And from Silicon Valley, Crunchbase reports that prominent VC Andreessen Horowitz’s big flying IPOs are now, well, not so much: “Of Andreessen’s 17 portfolio companies that went public at initial valuations of $1 billion or more in roughly the past 18 months, all but one are trading below their offer price. And even the one outlier — Airbnb — is down from its first-day closing price,” Crunchbase noted. Bottom line: The market may shoot back up anytime, but this doesn’t feel like a plain-vanilla dip to me. This article was featured in a Saturday edition of the Morning Brief on May 14, 2022.

5/16/2022,"South Africa is by far the world’s largest producer of platinum, a precious metal that is among the rarest on Earth, and extremely valuable to the electronics industry. The country holds over 80% of the world’s platinum reserves, but its mines are battling an unlikely problem that threatens to hit the industry hard: thievery. For years, mining companies in South Africa have been at war with increasingly well-organized crime syndicates that target the country’s lucrative mining industry, especially mines for rare-Earth metals such as platinum. But these thieves are not necessarily after the valuable silvery white metal. The real target is copper, found everywhere in cables and electrical wiring in mines, and which can be easily sold on the black market. Copper theft in platinum mines could disrupt the supply of a material that is in increasingly high demand around the world, especially for its applications in the electric car industry. Platinum’s ability to withstand high temperatures makes it an ideal material for the manufacturing of fuel cells, an alternative to battery-powered electric cars that promises to play a crucial role in the transition towards emission-free vehicles. Fuel cells are poised to have important applications in the electrification of larger vehicles, especially long-haul trucking. Battery-powered trucks have a limited range before they need to be recharged, but fuel cells are better suited to long-haul trucks that have the storage space to carry extra hydrogen. Demand is growing for the hydrogen fuel cell cars, especially in China, where the government recently announced its target to have 50,000 hydrogen fuel cars on the road by 2025. Several other international carmakers, including Hyundai and Toyota, have recently reaffirmed their commitment to hydrogen fuel cell cars with big investments. Platinum’s importance to producing these vehicles is set to put South Africa’s mining industry in the spotlight over the coming years. But to meet rising demand, the country will have to figure out how to deal with its thievery problem first. Copper theft has been widespread in South Africa for years, with thieves targeting industries including mining, transportation, and telecommunications. Copper prices have soared over the past decade, with the commodity almost tripling in value since 2015. High prices, combined with the sheer ubiquity of the metal, used for wiring in virtually every electronic device imaginable, has made it an attractive target for metal looters in South Africa. Illegal miners in the country are everywhere, but are often grouped together and known as “zama zamas,” which in Zulu translates to “keep on trying,” or “to gamble.” Zama zamas are a broad group, many of whom are undocumented immigrants from neighboring countries who used to work in mining but have since been laid off. And while zama zamas take the brunt of the blame for most instances of copper theft in South Africa, they are far from the only group known to be stealing the metal. “Copper theft is performed by many very desperate people, some of whom like to blame it all on zama zamas as there is significant xenophobia in that gesture—but it is a widespread phenomenon across the country,” Rosalind Morris, a professor of anthropology at Columbia University who directed a 2021 documentary on the group, told Fortune. Illegal miners are often heavily armed, possess explosives, and intrude on both abandoned and operational mines, according to a report from South Africa’s Mining Council. Looters often spend days at a time underground, bringing with them food and water rations, and in operational mines, illegal miners have even been known to set booby traps or ambushes for mining staff or even rival gangs. Both mining companies and the South African government have attempted to crack down on illegal mining for years, sometimes with fatal consequences. Last year, eight illegal miners were killed in a shootout with police above a mine in South Africa’s North West province. During the COVID-19 lockdowns of the past few years, copper theft accelerated, with gangs becoming more sophisticated and organized. Some have even started their own schools to teach new members how to steal copper and other metal. Sibanye-Stillwater, a mining company that is the world’s largest primary producer of platinum, recorded 165 incidents of theft since the beginning of 2021, Bloomberg reported, which have disrupted operations multiple times and forced the company to step up security. Platinum is an important element used in the manufacturing of specialized electronic devices such as optic fibers. It is also an important material for the auto industry and jewelry-making. For cars, the metal is a crucial component in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, and also in manufacturing autocatalytic converters, devices which reduce tailpipe emissions from internal combustion engine cars. Interest in South African platinum is also expected to rise, given supply constraints of the metal from Russia, which accounted for 10% of global supply. But the pervasiveness of copper theft disrupting mining operations could lead to higher operational costs, which could exacerbate preexisting labor unrest issues in the industry and make meeting the elevated demand a challenge. “South Africa's platinum sector will remain prone to strikes and labor unrest over the coming years, as high operational costs constrain wage increases by producers,” analysts at research and data analytics firm Fitch Solutions wrote in an industry forecast shared with Fortune. “Looking further ahead, South Africa's platinum industry will continue to encounter structural challenges relating to high costs and power supply issues, which could constrain long-term growth,” analysts said.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Most Read from Bloomberg Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Whereabouts of Terra’s Bitcoin Reserve a Mystery After Transfers Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape Ukraine Latest: NATO Embraces Sweden and Finland; Oil Gains The euro is on the verge of U.S. dollar parity for the first time in two decades. Europe’s common currency has already slumped to a five-year low near $1.03, buckling from a rush into the greenback as a haven from market turmoil and on the war in Ukraine. That’s led the likes of HSBC Holdings Plc and RBC Capital Markets to predict the two will hit parity in 2022. Hedge funds are already betting on it. They’ve piled on $7 billion in notional value into options wagers on parity in the past month alone, making it the most popular trade among those looking for a further drop in the common currency. “The euro itself is not an attractive currency at the moment,” said Francesco Pesole, a currency strategist at ING Groep NV. While the Dutch bank is keeping its official euro forecast for the next six months at $1.05, Pesole admits the dollar’s strength and market volatility means parity is likely. To a large extent the euro’s plight is a function of dollar strength, which has been supercharged as the Federal Reserve presses on with bigger interest-rate hikes than its peers. A fresh bout of global risk aversion that has taken the wind out of equity and credit markets is only adding momentum to the move into haven currencies. There’s also a darkening outlook for the European economy. A continuing standoff with Moscow over the supply of natural gas to the continent has raised the prospect of a pronounced slowdown. The International Monetary Fund has slashed its 2022 growth forecast for the currency bloc to 2.8%. That’s left the European Central Bank walking a tightrope. It has to balance the need for tighter policy to tame record inflation against the prospect of the economic damage that could cause -- especially in some of the region’s most indebted member states such as Italy. While officials may raise rates above zero before the end of the year, there are doubts over further hikes beyond that. ECB Officials Increasingly See Rate Exceeding Zero This Year Investors will be watching speeches from the likes of ECB President Christine Lagarde in coming days, as well as the minutes of the bank’s April meeting on Thursday, for further clues on thinking. Lagarde has joined a crowd of policy makers signaling a hike as soon as July. “I think it’s politically difficult for many in the ECB to sound too dovish, considering that inflation has likely not yet peaked,” said Peter McCallum, a rates strategist at Mizuho International Plc. “Unless we get 50 basis-point hikes being talked about, it’s tough for many of the hawks to surprise the market now.” Any renewed selloff in the euro that breaches the January 2017 low of $1.0341 -- almost touched on both Thursday and Friday -- could set the currency up for further losses. Tail Risk With the region’s bonds also being dumped, the currency market may start to factor in debt risks in the euro zone, according to HSBC Holdings Plc strategists including Dominic Bunning. The spread between Italian and German yields -- seen as a risk gauge -- topped 200 basis points this month for the first time since the early days of the pandemic. Not everyone is negative. Roberto Mialich, a currency strategist at UniCredit SpA, expects the euro to climb back above $1.10 in the course of next year as the Fed’s hiking cycle tails off. He sees a lasting below-parity scenario as just a tail risk, and only likely if euro-zone growth slumps far more than feared. Yet as long as risk assets remain vulnerable, traditional havens like the dollar and the yen will stay in vogue. Russia’s war in Ukraine also remains a major headwind for the euro, particularly given the prospect of further disruptions in gas supplies. “The euro has already faced more downward pressure than we expected, but we find it hard to see a silver lining for the single currency at this stage,” HSBC strategists wrote in a note, pointing to downward revisions to growth forecasts and upward revisions for inflation. “This is a nasty cocktail for any currency to try to digest.” This Week UK labor data is due as well as inflation figures for April, which are expected to show consumer prices rose an annual 9.1% from 7% in March, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed. For the euro-area, the minutes of the latest ECB meeting will be released, albeit there may be few surprises given the raft of central bank policy makers that have expounded their views As well as the minutes, speakers next week include ECB Executive Board member Luis de Guindos and ECB President Christine Lagarde. BOE rate setters Andrew Bailey, Dave Ramsden, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders will be grilled by lawmakers on Monday. European government bond issuance volume should pick up to about 25 billion euros next week, with supply from countries including Germany, France, Spain, Finland and Slovakia, according to Commerzbank AG.

5/16/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- A mass exodus of money, an $11 trillion wipeout, and the worst losing streak for global stocks since the 2008 financial crisis. The bad news is that it may not be over yet. Most Read from Bloomberg Goldman’s Blankfein Says US at 'Very, Very High Risk' of Recession $11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over Whereabouts of Terra’s Bitcoin Reserve a Mystery After Transfers Terra Hasn’t Killed Crypto, But It Was a Narrow Escape Ukraine Latest: NATO Embraces Sweden and Finland; Oil Gains The selloff in the MSCI ACWI Index has dramatically lowered valuations of companies across the US and Europe, but strategists ranging from Michael Wilson at Morgan Stanley to Robert Buckland at Citigroup Inc. expect stocks to fall further amid worries of high inflation, hawkish central banks and slowing economic growth, especially in the US. Money is continuing to leave every asset class and the exodus is deepening as investors rush out of names like Apple Inc., according to Bank of America Corp. Historically significant technical levels for the S&P 500 show the index has room to fall nearly 14% more before hitting key support levels, while the share of companies that have so far hit a one-year low is still a far cry from the number during the economic growth scare that slammed stocks in 2018. “Investors continue to reduce their positions, particularly in technology and growth stocks,” said Andreas Lipkow, a strategist at Comdirect Bank. “But sentiment needs to deteriorate significantly more to form a potential floor.” On the other side, some say the rout has already created pockets of value across sectors including commodities and even technology, which is valued on future earnings growth and, therefore, generally shunned during periods of high interest rates. The Nasdaq 100 rallied on Friday, but it still closed the week down over 2%. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Peter Oppenheimer has been among the most high-profile strategists to say it’s time to buy the dip, while Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital LLC, said “old school tech” stocks including Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc. were now trading at attractive multiples. But amid the morsels of value, the broader market looks to be buckling as recession creeps more and more into the conversation. And even as growth worries mount, the inflation focus at the Federal Reserve and other central banks means investors can’t count any more on the monetary elixir that’s helped to keep alive the long-running bull market. The MSCI ACWI has fallen for six straight weeks, the Stoxx Europe 600 is down 6% since late March, while the S&P 500 has dropped more than twice as much. Here are some key metrics showing the potential downside for stock markets. Falling Fast The S&P 500 is still about 14% above its 200-week moving average, a level that’s previously been a floor during all major bear markets, except for the tech bubble and the global financial crisis. Strategists at Canaccord Genuity say there could be further declines on Monday on forced margin selling after yet another red week for the US benchmark. Stressing Out For all the recent declines -- the S&P 500 is down more than 13% from its high on March 29 -- stress indicators also aren’t at levels seen during comparable slumps. Fewer than 30% of the benchmark’s members have hit a one-year low, compared with nearly 50% during the growth scare in 2018 and 82% during the global financial crisis in 2008. In addition, the 14-day relative strength index suggests the S&P 500 isn’t yet at the floor. While the Stoxx Europe 600 Index entered into oversold territory last week, the US benchmark has not yet hit that level, which is generally a precursor to a rebound. Getting Defensive Defensive stocks have been in demand as the specter of slowing growth hammers economically sensitive cyclical sectors. The Stoxx 600 Defensives Index is flat in 2022 versus a 15% drop for cyclicals, and strategists at Barclays and Morgan Stanley expect that trend to continue. At UBS Wealth Management, Claudia Panseri sees pricing for a “mild recession” in the cyclical-versus-defensive relative performance. Comparison with past periods of defensive strength also signals the potential for more to come. Relative gains this year still trail the performance in 2016, brought on by a slowdown in China and Brexit worries, and in the early days of the pandemic in 2020. Cheap-ish Although valuations of technology stocks have fallen sharply -- the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 now trades at about 20-times forward earnings, the lowest since April 2020 -- some strategists expect them to remain under pressure from aggressive monetary tightening by central banks. Tech stocks just suffered their biggest weekly outflows of the year, according to Bank of America. And even after the crushing price drops, Valerie Gastaldy, a technical analyst at Day By Day SAS, says the sector is at risk of losing another 10% before finding a floor. “I don’t think we have seen capitulation just yet,” said Dan Boardman-Weston, chief executive of BRI Wealth Management. “This week has been pretty brutal, and investor sentiment, especially in the technology area, is shot to pieces. We’re going to have a tricky few weeks and months ahead.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek What Happened When a Wall Street Investment Giant Moved to Nashville Venture Capitalists Are Aiming to Disrupt Fish Farming Crypto’s Fall, in Three Charts Starbucks Baristas Are Unionizing, and Even Howard Schultz Can’t Make Them Stop How Gillette Embraced the Beard to Win Over Scruffy Millennials ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•21 hours ago,$11 Trillion and Counting: Global Stock Slump May Not Be Over,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-trillion-counting-global-stock-063000467.html
