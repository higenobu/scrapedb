2/18/2022,"Developers will be forced to help fund the construction of social housing in Victoria through a new levy that has been described as “fantastic” by advocates for homeless people but which the property industry says will worsen housing affordability. From 1 July 2024, new Victorian developments of three or more dwellings and lot subdivisions of three or more must contribute 1.75% of the as-if-complete market value to a social housing growth fund.  Victoria’s treasurer, Tim Pallas, said the contribution would affect fewer than 30% of all residential planning permits but would raise more than $800m each year, paying for up to 1,700 new social and affordable homes and supporting 7,000 jobs in the construction sector every 12 months. “This is a big, generational reform,” Pallas told reporters on Friday. On a house valued at the median Melbourne price of $1.1m, the levy would equate to about $19,600. Jenny Smith, chief executive of the Council to Homeless Persons, described it as a “fantastic” initiative. “As the population grows, the demand also for social housing grows, and that’s what people forget – that as a state, as we become richer as more and more people contribute to our economy, we have to do more to take care of people who are priced out of the market at the bottom of the scale,” Smith said. But with developers likely to pass the cost on to buyers, and house prices already at record highs, the property industry has questioned why homebuyers have been targeted. Matthew Kandelaars, chief executive of the Urban Development Institute of Australia’s Victorian branch, said homebuyers should not be responsible for the historical underinvestment in social housing by successive state governments. “We do appreciate the urgent and critical need for greater funding for social housing, but what disappoints us is ultimately it is shifting the cost from the government’s balance sheet to homebuyers,” he said. Kandelaars said first home buyers and young families would be most affected by the levy, given they are more likely to be buying new properties, including apartments in metropolitan Melbourne and house and land packages in growth areas. “It’s a missed opportunity. We think that there should have been a broader base to this tax, it shouldn’t have to fall solely to the feet of Victorian new homebuyers,” he said. While some local councils in New South Wales and South Australia require developers to pay a contribution towards the cost of providing social or affordable housing, this is the first state government scheme to be introduced. The Victorian government on Friday also announced social housing properties would be exempt from paying council rates from mid next year. The rates reform will be phased in over four years from 1 July 2023 and will only apply to social housing properties. Housing minister Richard Wynne said the $54m currently spent on public housing rates will be reinvested into public housing maintenance, upgrade works and better open spaces. Both initiatives will apply to all local government areas in metropolitan Melbourne, as well as the regional cities of Ballarat, Greater Bendigo and Greater Geelong. “Today really is about the biggest reform to social housing since the formation of the Housing Commission in the 1940s,” Wynne said. It follows the $5.3b “big housing build” announced by the government in 2020 to fund 12,000 new social and affordable homes in four years. Katelyn Butterss from the Victorian Public Tenants Association said the rates exemption would be a “huge relief” to those who live in old public housing stock, which is in “desperate need” of modification. She welcomed the additional funding for the social housing growth fund but noted it traditionally has funded only community housing projects. “We call on the government to ensure that at least a portion of these new homes are publicly owned and managed,” Butterss said. The Property Council of Australia’s Victorian executive director, Danni Hunter, said it was the 10th new property-based tax introduced by the Andrews Labor government. “At a time where other jurisdictions in Australia are discussing tax reform, Victoria remains the only state in Australia that is implementing tax increases,” she said. “This is yet another wrong tax at the wrong time.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The state’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, described the reforms as “completely unfair” for first home buyers and maintained he would introduce “no new taxes” if elected in November. Smith, however, said the measures would make “very little difference to developers or homebuyers in the fullness of time”. “We pay for it anyway in our hospitals and psych hospitals and prisons. There are so many people using those very expensive beds, who really just need a home and the support to keep them,” she said. “The international evidence shows that it actually settles house prices down when there’s enough social housing in the community.”",News/Australia news,Victoria to impose $800m levy on property developers to fund social housing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/victoria-to-impose-800m-levy-on-property-developers-to-fund-social-housing
2/18/2022,"On 4 September 2020, Roger Michell and Jim Broadbent came to Venice to unveil a British film called The Duke. The forecast was stormy and the festival was in peril, staged in defiance of a global pandemic, with tubs of hand sanitiser on the red carpet and thermal cameras at the doors. The premiere shouldn’t have worked and yet somehow it did. Afterwards, Broadbent recalls, he and the director unhooked their masks and breathed a sigh of relief. “I remember turning to Roger and saying: ‘Oh, I am glad that we came.’” I was in Venice that day; I was glad they came, too. The premiere was a hit and The Duke was a hoot, a boisterous true-crime caper, pungently set in early 60s Newcastle and spotlighting the theft of a famous oil painting. Michell’s timing was impeccable. He delivered the perfect picture for the perfect moment, a tonic for flagging spirits. For a few hours at least, The Duke felt like a reaffirmation of core values, a tale of the past that pointed to a brighter tomorrow. Indirectly, it assured us that everything was OK. But 18 months later, the world is still waiting to see it.  Onscreen, The Duke plays out as a comedy. Offscreen, however, the film is a tragedy – at once a casualty of the pandemic and a posthumous classic. Covid scuppered its scheduled release. Michell died suddenly in September last year. The film’s cast and crew are still reeling, in shock. I speak to Nicky Bentham, The Duke’s producer. She explains that she now sees her role as that of the director’s spokesperson. She wants to honour his intentions and celebrate his legacy. But she’s still processing the loss; can’t quite believe that he’s gone. She had hoped the film would be the first of many collaborations with Michell. Instead, it turned out to be the last. “I get quite emotional talking about it,” she says. “This is like therapy for me.” Perhaps fittingly, The Duke spins the tale of a dead man’s masterpiece, whisked from under our noses and securely hidden from view. It stars Broadbent as the true-life Kempton Bunton, a soapbox revolutionary and wannabe playwright who stashed a stolen Goya in his back bedroom as part of a crackpot scheme to secure free TV licences for the nation’s pensioners. Along the way, Michell juggles knockabout farce with kitchen-sink social realism; domestic spats with soaring rhetoric. Ostensibly, The Duke is a salute to the rackety British underdog – a comic tradition that extends back through Tony Hancock, Lucky Jim and The Lavender Hill Mob. But it is also, inadvertently, a film about its creator. It shows us what moved him, what drove him. His presence back-shadows what we see in the frame. “This is his last film,” says Helen Mirren, who co-stars as Dorothy Bunton, Kempton’s pinched, harried wife. “And it’s a wonderful film to be his last because it carries within it all his strengths as a film-maker. His brilliant technique. His warmth as a person. His wonderful understanding of life and humanity. And we all recognised that as we were making it. We all knew that we were in Roger’s film.” It’s curious, in hindsight, to realise that there was ever anything so instantly recognisable as a Roger Michell production. Most successful directors like to announce their presence and perfect a signature style. Michell, though, was the quiet man of British cinema, a sort of expert butler in the wings. In the course of an eclectic 40-year career, he glided from the stage to TV to feature film-making and back again. He directed big, splashy Britpics (1999’s Notting Hill) and small, knotty human dramas (Venus, The Mother). He shot Hollywood pictures (Changing Lanes, Hyde Park on Hudson) and oversaw intimate documentaries (the acclaimed Nothing Like a Dame and the forthcoming Elizabeth, completed just before his death). He created fine, lasting work but he flew under the radar. Bentham would largely go along with that. Actually, she says, that’s what she loved about the man: the fact that he could turn his hand to anything and find a home in any setting. “Probably he flew under the radar because he wasn’t paying attention to the radar. He was paying attention to the story, the people, the script.” She sighs. “If he were more guided by trends – by public opinion or branding – he might have been seen as a landmark director of a certain genre. But that wasn’t him. He was never guided by external forces.” It’s clear he was loved. His cast and crew all adored him. Broadbent first worked with Michell on the 2013 film Le Week-End, in which he played an anguished old academic rattling around Paris. After that the pair became friends. They were north London neighbours. Michell was imaginative, generous, entirely without ego. “He was my favourite director,” Broadbent says. “He allowed everyone to be the best possible version of themselves.” The Duke’s co-writers, Richard Bean and Clive Coleman, paint a similar picture. They recall that the project was initially offered to several other directors, who either weren’t interested or weren’t available. “The key thing that Roger brought was a kind of calm,” Bean says. “He made us all confident that the film was going to get made. There was no anxiety, or histrionics, or drama. The sense was just: ‘Oh, here’s the guy who knows what he’s doing.’ And all of a sudden everyone’s happy.” “Yes, he was a calming presence,” says Coleman. “I think that’s probably why actors loved him. Whatever neuroses actors suffer from, he was somehow the great antidote.” Finally, I hear from Anna Maxwell Martin, who plays a supporting role in The Duke. Martin says that she first met the director on a play, Honour, at the National theatre, and “fell in love with him straight away”. The pair were married between 2002 and 2020 and had two daughters together, Maggie and Nancy. “Roger only made films and plays about human interaction,” she explains. “That seems obvious. Aren’t all films and plays about human interaction? But no, they aren’t. They get swamped by bells and whistles. The relationships get lost.” In Michell’s work, she feels, the human element was always front and centre. “I suppose I had a particularly intimate experience of working with Roger,” Martin says. “He thought I mucked about far too much. ‘Put the cheese down, dear!’ he’d shout across the set as I was lobbing about a wheel of cheddar, just because. He’d sit in the corner with a little handheld monitor, like a monk. Never being demonstrative. Just doing the work, serving the script.” The Duke wrapped production just before the first lockdown. It premiered to glowing reviews at Venice and Telluride and was set for release in autumn 2020. Cameron McCracken, managing director of Pathé UK, says that the plan was to capitalise on the festival buzz and introduce it into the all-important awards corridor, riding the wave through the Baftas to a possible finish at the Oscars. But Covid rates kept spiking and the film’s success depended on an older audience showing up. The release was delayed a full year, to September 2021, before being pushed back yet again in response to Omicron. It has been a wretched situation, an ongoing exercise in crisis management. But McCracken doesn’t see how it could have been handled differently. Pathe, he points out, is a small independent outfit. It develops, produces and finances perhaps three or four films every year. So the stakes are high; every release is a gamble. He says: “If we get it wrong, I’ve destroyed the company.” Next Friday, two years after it went before the cameras, Michell’s film comes limping across the finish line. McCracken is pleased to have at last seen it through, but it is a bittersweet coda; hardly the triumph he had envisaged. “This was supposed to be a great time,” he says. “It was going to mark the moment a modest, understated, brilliant director suddenly came into his own. I looked at The Duke as a coronation.” Instead, it’s a funeral, which feels rubbish and wrong. McCracken is sad that the delayed release appears to have largely shut the film out of the awards conversation. Mostly, he’s upset that Michell never had the chance to watch this quintessentially British movie on home soil. “The fact that he was denied that is horrible,” he says. Ultimately, though, it’s the work that remains. One winter evening I revisit The Duke in more humdrum surroundings (in the living room, on a laptop), 18 months after its Venice premiere. There, on screen, as if by magic, is Broadbent’s glorious performance as loudmouthed Bunton, a socialist upstart who puts his faith “not in God but in people”. He is berating shopfloor managers in Newcastle. He is telling the Old Bailey jury: “I’m you and you’re me.” That we are stronger together; that we build a better world, too. The film, I am relieved to note, is just as good as it ever was. But its circumstances have changed and those ripples are still being felt. What was conceived as a rousing class-war comedy now looks slightly different. It is shop-damaged and tragedy-struck a victim of human frailty; perhaps a reflection of it, too. “The film doesn’t change,” says McCracken. “What’s changed is the emphasis of the message and how that is read by the public. Because when we started shooting, the idea that Kempton speaks to in the film – that a society is only as strong as its weakest link – might have seemed a bit abstract. We couldn’t know that we were moving into two years of Covid, death and insecurity, where our society would be judged on a daily basis by how well it protects its oldest and most vulnerable. So that journey’s been fascinating. It somehow makes the film feel more trenchant.” Michell died on 22 September 2021 at his London home. He was 65. The cause of death was never made public, but his family has now confirmed that he died of a heart attack. He is survived by four children (including Harry and Rosanna by his first wife, the actor turned lawyer Kate Buffery) and 15 feature films, heaps of stage productions, buckets of TV dramas. He leaves us The Duke, which is a particularly lovely parting shot. Coleman says he was devastated when Bentham called him with the news. Then he attended the funeral and came away feeling better. “It was an absolutely extraordinary experience,” he says. “I almost made notes and gave them to my family. The funeral was held in a church in Hampstead and there must have been 350 people there, everyone he’d ever come into contact with; the place was rammed to the rafters. And as well as being sad, it was also fantastically uplifting and joyous. I think that Roger was a truly joyous man, actually. That’s why The Duke is a great testament to his personality. But in a strange way, I think that the funeral was, too.” It is a drizzly afternoon in mid-February and Jim Broadbent has been speaking to reporters all day. The journey that began alongside Michell on the Venice red carpet wraps up here, in a London hotel, staring down the barrel of a laptop and doggedly moving from one interview to the next. The actor is dry-mouthed and exhausted; he says that he has never talked quite so much in his life. Nonetheless he’s determined to do right by the film. “It’s an emotional day for me,” he says. “It’s not enjoyable, but it’s something I want to do. Because this is the last chance to celebrate what a brilliant director Roger was, and what a wonderful person he was. That makes me want to promote the film more than I would normally want to promote a film. I want to put it out there and remember what we did. I want to tell people about it. To tell them about him.”  The Duke is out in the UK on 25 February",Arts/Film,"‘A testament to his joyous personality’: the stars of Roger Michell’s final film, The Duke, pay tribute",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/18/a-testament-to-his-joyous-personality-the-stars-of-roger-michells-final-film-the-duke-pay-tribute
2/18/2022,"Restrictions on political topics in schools will harm young people by curbing discussions about the polarised arguments and issues they are exposed to on social media, according to the government’s former mental health champion. Natasha Devon said young people from minority backgrounds stood to be the biggest losers if the new guidelines meant teachers in England were afraid to provide students with a safe environment to debate issues.  “I work with 14- to 18-year-olds and my experience is that young people are bringing ideas from social media, from activists that they admire, into the classroom,” said Devon, who was the first ever mental health champion for schools. “Teachers are trying to help them to make sense of those ideas, and discuss them in a way that is non-partisan. But the desire to address these things in the classroom is 100% coming from young people, it’s a not a case of indoctrination by teachers.” This week the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, published guidance aimed at teachers in England, as part of an effort by the government to dampen down critical debate about the history of the British empire, and controversy over the role of leaders such as Winston Churchill. The guidance – which is a reformulation of existing statutory regulations and legal duties – stresses the need for impartiality when teaching “contentious” issues such as imperialism. It cautions teachers against adopting or advocating “extreme” political positions such as those it claims are espoused by the Black Lives Matter movement, which is singled out by name in the document as needing to be balanced. But Devon compared the guidance to the section 28 regulations concerning classroom discussion of homosexuality in force during the late 1980s and 1990s. “With section 28 it didn’t say you can’t talk about homosexuality, it said you were not allowed to ‘promote’ homosexuality,” she said. “But what ended up happening is that no one talked about it and I think the same thing is going to happen now, which will harm minority students by taking away their space to explore issues like race and social justice that are affecting them all the time.” Rowena Seabrook, Amnesty International UK’s humans rights education manager, agreed, saying: “The government’s guidance for schools is unnecessary – and it will have a chilling effect in classrooms across the country. “Suggesting that teachers should not use material from social justice movements such as Black Lives Matter is entirely partisan, and lacks balance and safe spaces for students to explore issues labelled ‘controversial’.” Natasha Robinson, a researcher at the University of Oxford who studies how controversial subjects are taught in history classrooms, said the guidance “leaves teachers with the impression that they could be bludgeoned for most of what they teach”. She added: “Giving teachers a list of thing that they shouldn’t talk about, or of things they should avoid, is very different from giving them practical strategies in the classroom. When a student makes a racist comment or a very partisan political comment, how do teachers deal with that? That takes a great deal of skill. And this report – because it’s so vague – just comes across as scare-mongering.” Nick Lowles, chief executive of Hope Not Hate, a campaigning antifascism and antiracism group, said the DfE’s guidelines seemed designed to create headlines about “culture wars” rather than improving education. “Turning the need to teach children about racism and prejudice into a political football is cynical and does little to help schools navigating this complex topic,” Lowles said.",News/Education,"Curbing political topics in English schools will harm minority students, say critics",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/18/curbing-political-topics-in-english-schools-will-harm-minority-students-say-critics
2/18/2022,"Across the world, public murals have given bursts of cultural and political expression to cityscapes. Some of their creators, such as Banksy, have even become millionaires in the process. But in Ireland, a collective of street artists known as Subset are about to enter a court battle as part of a 10-year “game of cat and mouse” with Dublin city council over three murals, including one celebrating the life of Sir David Attenborough.  Under Irish law, organisers of public murals need planning permission. Subset argues Dublin is behind the times and should embrace street culture as others cities have, such as Melbourne where the authorities say artists are free to paint murals in certain zones providing permission has been granted by the building owner and the content is apolitical. Previously, they say they have complied with any enforcement proceedings on the 12 sites they have used across the city by painting over the murals or replacing the mural in question with a fresh work of art, any time they were issued with warnings or enforcement proceedings. The council is now taking the artists to court for alleged breaches of planning laws which require prior consent for public murals. But Subset have decided to fight legal proceedings in relation to three of their murals – the Attenborough work, another known as “horseboy” celebrating the traditional horse fair in city centre Smithfield and a third which marked mental health awareness month. Subset said all their murals are painted with permission and consultation of the buildings occupants or owners but are calling on the government to liberalise the rules governing murals. “We have put forward proposed amendments to the laws in conjunction with architects, solicitors, but we were left just going around the houses; speaking with city council representatives, Arts Council representatives, ministers and really to no avail. “We thought the only way we could actually grab the attention and focus of the city council was to engage in the legal proceedings that they have brought against us because we have tried on multiple occasions to have this conversation and got nowhere,” said a spokesperson who requested anonymity as do all the collective’s artists. Subset’s works are well known in Dublin with impactful takes on contemporary issues including Covid, LGBTQ+ rights and the abortion referendum in 2018. The Attenborough mural which covers a gable wall and rear extension on a privately owned house close to the city centre took 10-12 people eight days to paint and was designed as a tribute for his 93rd birthday in 2019. Horseboy took two artists five days and is based on a photograph taking by an Australian artist who agreed to his work being the basis on the work on a council house wall. Proceedings were initiated in 2020 with a district court hearing scheduled for next month. In many cities across the world, public murals are illegal but authorities turn a blind eye to their existence but Subset has said that other cities have relaxed the rules in certain zones. “We don’t want artists to be in a position of weakness, which is the case when you don’t have the law on your side,” said the spokesperson. Dublin city council said it could not comment on active legal proceedings.",News/World news,Dublin city council takes street artists to court over murals,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/18/dublin-city-council-takes-street-artists-to-court-over-murals-sir-david-attenborough
2/18/2022,"After a treacly, uneven third season, The Marvelous Mrs Maisel (Amazon Prime) appears to have found its fangs again. “Revenge … I crave it. I am completely consumed by the need for it,” purrs Midge/Miriam (nobody seems to call her Midge any more), rediscovering her sharp edges, now back on a small stage in a dingy nightclub, with an act that is heavy on the F-word. This show is never better than when Miriam is having to fight tooth and nail for her spot in the limelight, and it is a welcome relief to see her having to do it again. “That’s life. Shit happens,” she declares, ending the routine on a surprisingly acerbic note. I say surprising because, while the first two seasons were a lot of fun, Mrs Maisel found herself in a rut during the third, which paired huge set pieces with a meandering plot and episodes that felt far longer than they were. Season three all-but guaranteed that Miriam was going to make it big, until her seemingly certain path to stardom and home ownership hit not so much a road block as a solid brick wall, when she accidentally(ish) outed the biggest star in the world to his adoring audience. It appears that few picked up on the Judy Garland references that felt a little ahead of their time, but it was enough to get her fired from her fame-making tour, and bring her back to where it all started.  This down-in-the-dirt, underdog position suits Mrs Maisel far more than the big-bucks razzle-dazzle of a dance troupe performing on a huge stage for a massive audience of soldiers, for example. We pick up precisely where we left off, with Miriam on the runway, pleading for her job back, and Susie – whose financial entanglements make losing the opportunity of a lifetime one of the least stressful parts of the episode – lamenting the fact that she left her client alone for four hours, “and you blow your career and buy an apartment”. The stakes are relatively low in this world, though, even when it comes to outing closeted superstars, or insurance fraud and theft on a grand scale. The resolutions come quickly and neatly. This is partly why I find it hard to love this series, despite frequently admiring it. While the balance between domesticity and ambition is part of its fabric – this is a female stand-up comedian with two children in 1960, after all – it is tricky to muster up the same amount of enthusiasm for a sequence about how Miriam will balance her various store credits and what happens when the milk delivery fails to turn up, as it is for a fearsome standup set that showcases the best of Rachel Brosnahan’s magnificent, mesmerising performance. Here, Brosnahan makes light work of a woman reduced once again to the lowly status of “girl comic”, albeit a girl comic who has made more enemies than she realises. That said, the zip and bounce really are back, whether that’s Susie and Joel having a characteristically quick and fiery conversation about money, or Susie and Miriam drunkenly bitching about mediocre male comics who make a living from punchlines that are visible from a mile away. The smoother edges have been roughed up, scoured away, and there’s an intriguing conflict emerging between the importance of financial security and the pursuit of art and satisfaction. This time, Amazon is releasing two episodes per week, rather than the whole season at once, and for a show that can be rich, it proves to be a clever act of moderation.",Arts/Television & radio,The Marvelous Mrs Maisel season four review – the zip and bounce are back!,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/18/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-four-review-the-zip-and-bounce-are-back
2/18/2022,"A new set of stamps is being launched to pay tribute to David Gentleman, the designer credited with changing the face of the British stamp. Gentleman, who has been hailed as the most prolific and influential British stamp designer, designed more than 100 stamps for Royal Mail between 1962 and 2000, and provided many more designs that were not used.  Royal Mail collaborated with him to choose a selection of some of his most famous and influential images. The tribute to Gentleman is notable as it is the first time Royal Mail has dedicated an entire issue to a designer of its commemorative stamps. David Gold, a spokesperson for Royal Mail, said Gentleman was “one of the foremost artists involved in British stamp design”. “For over half a century, he has made an enduring contribution to British stamp design. His work continues to influence and inspire designers today.” The first designs of Gentleman’s that were successful were for National Productivity Year in 1962, and used symbolic arrows. Three years later he wrote to the new postmaster general, Tony Benn, in response to a general invitation for ideas about stamps, recommending more interesting subjects than had been featured previously. He also proposed a new size of stamp and introduced a small cameo of the Queen, based on her profile as depicted by Mary Gillick on coins from 1953. His most recent issued stamp designs were for the millennium timekeeper miniature sheet, depicting the stylised hands of a clock and globe. The new set of six stamps will be available from Friday, and feature the 1962 National Productivity Year, the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings and the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Royal Mail has issued commemorative stamps in the past to celebrate historic events and notable figures, such as stamps commemorating the Rolling Stones and celebrating 150 years of rugby union. Gentleman said: “Stamps were fun to design, though squeezing a lot into a small space wasn’t easy. At first it was difficult to fit in the Queen’s head until I turned it into the simple profile which is still used today. “Stamps I particularly enjoyed designing were for the Battle of Hastings 1066, and Social Reformers.”",Arts/Art and design,Special Royal Mail set pays tribute to man who put stamp on British design,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/18/special-royal-mail-set-pays-tribute-to-man-who-put-stamp-on-british-design
2/18/2022,"Nasa is setting up two space missions that will help us understand space weather and the constantly changing space environment. Space is filled with charged particles and magnetic fields that originate on the Sun. This “solar wind” is turbulent and can damage technology on Earth and in space. Because it is a form of radiation, it can also be harmful to astronauts. Nasa’s two new missions will study the origin of the solar wind and the turbulence within it.  The Multi-slit Solar Explorer (Muse) will study the forces responsible for the heating of the Sun’s outer atmosphere, and the flares and eruptions that help drive space weather. To do this it will use a camera that captures extreme ultraviolet radiation coming from the hot gas in this atmospheric region of the Sun. The HelioSWARM mission consists of nine small spacecraft that will fly in formation to simultaneously measure the conditions of the solar wind across a larger area of space. This will allow the first large scale, in-situ study of turbulence in the solar wind. The missions cost $192m (£140m) and $250m respectively and are expected be ready for launch no later than February 2026.

The homepage kind of looks like a Google calendar: you book in a 50-minute session and the site matches you with someone else who wants to work in that time slot (this is mostly done randomly although brand new users are matched with more experienced ones). When the time comes, you and your buddy get placed on a video call. You politely and briefly tell each other what you’re planning to use the time to do and then you get on with it.  When the pandemic hit and we all started to work from home, I experienced what I like to call the kitchen drift. You sit down to write six emails, but halfway through the first you find that you’re making a cup of coffee, and then actually your bedroom is messy so why not just put a few clothes away, but that’s also where your phone is charging, and so why not treat yourself to a YouTube video or five – after all, no one is watching. Oh look, it’s lunchtime. This kind of procrastinating didn’t mean I ended up working less, just that work that would take me a few hours in the office was dragging into my evenings and early mornings, eating up my social time. I know I’m not alone in this: after monitoring changes in web activity of their huge user base during the pandemic, NordVPN released a study that showed the average American’s working day was lengthened by three hours once they started working from home. I had tried other things in the past to cut down on distraction – putting blockers on my Chrome to stop me going on non-work websites, the popular Pomodoro Technique in which you work for 25 minutes and then take a break for five (my breaks could last for hours). Discovering Focusmate saved me. First of all it makes you think about what you can reasonably do in 50 minutes – the length of a session – forces you to organise your day and prioritise your goal. Sitting down with another human being and sharing those goals creates both accountability and urgency. The site was created by Taylor Jacobson. The brainwave came to him in 2015: a friend had a big presentation coming up but had a terrible procrastination habit and was worried he wouldn’t get his preparations completed in time. They decided they would stay on a Skype call, telling each other what they were doing and leaving the window open to make sure they were doing it. Both of them felt they were suddenly in a productive, concentrated flow state they hadn’t previously managed to reach. I wanted to ask Jacobson about how he got from that idea to setting up a business but when I put in my interview request he suggested that rather than a phone call we send each other voice notes on WhatsApp. “It can be a nice way to get high fidelity and do some back and forth, sans scheduling.” Who am I to argue with the person that’s already improved my productivity threefold? I record my first message for him. In his reply, Jacobson says almost as soon as he had done the proto-Focusmate Skype call, he thought “millions of people need this”. He speaks loftily about what he describes as the philosophical aims with the project. He says he had “a dramatic paradigm shift of vulnerability” and started to think “what if we stopped trying so hard to figure out everything on our own and just asked ourselves, what do we actually need in order to be successful?” He says he took a lot of inspiration from tribal psychology, nervous system co-regulation, concepts that have been popularised recently by Bessel van der Kolk’s 2014 book The Body Keeps the Score, a book about trauma that is rarely out of the Amazon bestseller list. “Our lifestyles create constant stress in a way we weren’t designed to handle,” Jacobson says. “Our nervous system are designed to handle imminent physical danger and help us survive. There’s a tiger, so I need to run or fight for my life, for example.” He says that in our daily lives we experience stressors that our nervous systems can’t distinguish between those life and death situations. “So socially and physically, we repress all of the fight/flight energy that is constantly being stimulated in our nervous system. A low attention span is basically just a symptom of stress. When we feel safe we can focus, and humans are designed to experience safety through connection with others, through the tribe.” When my sessions begins I move my buddy to the corner of the screen and focus on what I need to be doing – constantly aware that we will be swapping notes about our progress at the end. For anyone who slouched their way through school but managed to pull it out of the bag during the final exam, you’ll know the feeling of working with a proctor – everything speeds up as you feel the time pressure. Since the start of the pandemic I have booked more than 180 of these sessions, although many users I match with have completed thousands. If you respect the session and set a clear goal, I find you can get more done in three 50-minute blocks as you could in a whole day not using it. What people are trying to achieve, and how much they think they can get done in the time, varies greatly. Some are just trying to read academic texts without distractions: “I made it to the end of the article!” is a common joyous refrain at the end of a session. Not everyone uses it for work – in early morning sessions you get people writing stream-of-consciousness “morning pages”, or even just reading the paper. I’ve had a couple of people use it just for tidying their room. Occasionally, at the end of the session, we talk a bit more about what we worked on. One young woman in Philadelphia tells me she would never have completed her undergraduate degree in psychology without hundreds of Focusmate sessions. A teacher in Oregon says it has changed the way she marks papers and has given her more demarcation between work and life. By connecting with someone on a video call, you’re providing some of those tribe-like feelings, it stops you feeling like just a little atom alone at your kitchen table. “When you mix together some structure, some accountability, and the human element, we move into an optimal, focused state,” says Jacobson. This might all seem like some deep psychology for an app that basically puts you on a Zoom call with a stranger, but Jacobson is far from the only one who is concerned that our lack of focus is now a central societal problem. There are big concerns that technology has stolen our ability to enter any kind of flow state, and this has been worsened by the disintegration between our personal and work lives. Recent books like Oliver Burkeman’s Four Thousand Weeks (named after the amount of time most of us have on earth), Jenny Odell’s How to do Nothing and Johann Hari’s Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention are part of an ever-growing literature that focus isn’t just something we’re losing but that our inability to use time meaningfully is the central problem facing the world today. Jacobson says that there were almost a million Focusmate sessions last year, and his aim is for the platform to one day reach 100 million users. People often ask me whether there are any weirdos on the site (Chatroulette, a somewhat utopian website that launched in the late 00s and let you speak with a random person anywhere in the world, quickly descended into little more than a meet-up for masturbators), but I have never been matched with anyone who wasn’t using the service genuinely. Jacobson says the high barriers to entry (you have to create a profile and talk about why you want to join) mean in the site’s history there has only ever been a tiny handful of isolated complaints, all dealt with by his team. A bigger problem is that it does feel as though its initial power can wane over time. Sometimes by the fourth session of the day, I take my pledge to my working partner less seriously and end up distracted. In those moments I go full nuclear mode and share my screen with my Focusmate – the site offers this functionality – obliterating my right to privacy and creating an extra layer of accountability. This is incredibly effective, although make sure the Guardian doesn’t find out about this as I’m sure it violates their privacy policy in 12 different ways. About 11 Focusmate sessions later I’m now at the end of working on this piece – I finish with Hilla, on the west coast of the US, who is making some changes to an online course. At the end, she asks me what my article is about, and I lie and tell her it’s about the US midterms. Talking to your Focusmate about your Focusmate article?

Gimlet, itself owned by Spotify, produces Science Vs: a fun, irreverent podcast that combines science with humour. In the episode, Science Vs: Joe Rogan, host Wendy Zukerman quickly addresses the “elephant in the room”, having written to the Spotify CEO, calling the decision to support Rogan a “slap in the face”. From now, Science Vs will only make new episodes that aim to debunk misinformation on the platform. Will it make a difference? Who knows? But it’s an admirable stance regardless. Rather than doing a deep dive into each of the examples of supposed misinformation that the Science Vs team counted in the episode, they choose a few claims to focus on. Using these, Zukerman and her producer instead explore how data and information can be manipulated and focused to present something very different from the whole picture, from cherry picking your samples to using anecdotal evidence instead of facts. If you’ve ever wondered how to counter some of these kinds of claims, it’s certainly a useful tool to know where they come from. Love a TV companion podcast?

2/18/2022,"The federal government has revealed it paid $13.75m to the creator of the Aboriginal flag, Luritja artist Harold Thomas, to assume copyright, and $6.3m to two non-Indigenous businesses who held licences to the design, amid a clash in Senate estimates over whether the flag had been “colonised”. WAM Clothing received $5.2m and Wooster Holdings, $1.1m, a Senate estimates committee has been told.  Ben Wooster, a Gold Coast-based businessman, has interests in both businesses. Wooster was previously director of Birubi Art, a company fined a record $2.3m by the federal court for selling fake Aboriginal art. The government’s legal costs in the matter ran to $500,000. The total package of more than $20m came from “additional” funds supplied by Treasury. In a heated exchange in Senate estimates, Greens senator, Lidia Thorpe, said the flag had been “colonised by the Australian government”. “The people I am bringing voice to in this place are very concerned that our flag has been colonised, given this is the colonisers’ headquarters and they’ve just purchased our flag,” Thorpe said. The LNP senator, Amanda Stoker, responded that the flag had been made free for all Australians, not “colonised”. “We have taken the flag from a situation where it was effectively being privately owned to a situation where, in accordance with the wishes of the Indigenous designer of the flag, it has been put in a position where it is safe, where it is available for Indigenous Australians, and indeed, all Australians full stop, because we want this to be a flag that gets the respect and enthusiasm it deserves,” Stoker said. “This is only about making things better. It is not about taking things away. And quite frankly the designer of the flag made it very clear that’s what he wanted for all Australians so that the flag could be the symbol of unity he wanted it to be.” Thorpe said the flag was now “Australian”. “Just like all Indigenous people,” Stoker replied. “They’re Australian. It’s wonderful.” “Really?” Thorpe replied. “Yes. I think it’s an uncontroversial proposition that Indigenous Australians are Australians,” Stoker said. Thorpe replied that it was “insulting” to her to be called an Indigenous Australian. “I’m not going to be told by a white senator that I’m an Indigenous Australian. That is insulting,” she said. “I’m a Gunnai Djap Wurrung Bralakaulung Gunditjmara woman,” Thorpe said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy had asked if the commonwealth had plans for the flag’s future management and custodianship. McCarthy chaired a 2020 parliamentary committee which recommended a series of options to “free the flag” and manage it. The committee recommended that if the government could voluntarily secure Thomas’ copyright, the flag should be administered by an independent Aboriginal statutory authority, in the same way the Torres Strait Islander flag is managed by the Torres Strait regional authority. Blair Excell, of the National Indigenous Australians Agency, said the recommendation had been considered by government, but it was Harold Thomas’ “very strong desire, intent and preference” that the copyright be managed by the commonwealth. The Aboriginal flag image can now be freely reproduced on websites, clothing, in paintings and other artworks, used digitally and in any other medium without having to ask for permission or pay a fee. Previously, Thomas’ sole copyright allowed him to grant licences to other parties to make copies of the flag design, or refuse permission entirely. In 2018, he gave an exclusive licence to WAM Clothing, which raised the ire of many by issuing infringement notices to small non-profit Aboriginal organisations as well as the AFL and NRL for their past use of the design. In announcing the deal on 25 January, the Morrison government said the Aboriginal flag “will now be managed in a similar manner to the Australian national flag, where its use is free, but must be presented in a respectful and dignified way”. But the company which retains exclusive rights to produce flags for sale, Carroll and Richardson Flagworld, accused the government of misleading the public by saying it had “freed the flag”. “As far as the flag’s concerned, it’s really business as usual. The only difference is the royalties will be paid to the government, which the government’s already indicated they’re going to use to fund programs for Naidoc, which is perfectly acceptable,” Wayne Gregory, the managing director of Carroll & Richardson Flagworld, said. “But what they’ve done is created the illusion that everything’s going to be free.” At Senate estimates, Excell said the media had misinterpreted the announcement. The media release announcing that the flag design would be freely available did acknowledge Flagworld’s continuing licence for the commercial production of flags and bunting – but this may not have been widely reported. “That is something that I think probably did contribute to some lack of understanding of the components,” he said. “But I think the government release was quite clear.”",News/Australia news,Aboriginal flag ‘colonised’: senators in heated exchange over government’s purchase of copyright,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/18/aboriginal-flag-colonised-senators-in-heated-exchange-over-governments-purchase-of-copyright
2/18/2022,"Amazon drivers have been awarded an enforceable minimum rate of pay in the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission, in what is believed to be a world first. From 1 March, Amazon Flex drivers will receive a minimum rate of pay, starting at $27.83 an hour and increasing to $37.80 by 1 July 2025, after a successful bid by the Transport Workers Union to overhaul the award in the commission.  TWU national secretary Michael Kaine said the successful application would see pay rises of up to 45% for some drivers. The union said it was the first time rates had risen for owner drivers and contract couriers in 15 years. “They have put in place a model that deliberately classifies workers as independent contractors so they can try to place them outside the system of protections,” Kaine said. “Amazon can now be held to account.” Amazon was not involved in the proceedings, which did not make any findings about their current practices. Amazon launched Flex in Australia in 2020 and promoted the parcel delivery service as a way for people to make extra money. It has about 2000 contractors signed up to the service, who all use their own cars and cover their overheads, like petrol. Many say it is impossible to make a living wage. One Amazon driver, who asked not to be named, said drivers are currently paid in a lump sum for blocks of work and have to send a request for any overtime. On Facebook, drivers share screenshots of blocks on offer. Recent ones show Amazon offering drivers $87-$90 for three hours of work. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning One of the “runs” on offer asks drivers to cross the city, delivering 39 packages to 33 stops within four hours – the first of which is 50 minutes away. To request overtime, the driver has to contact an overseas call centre, which reviews their application. “You have to call Amazon Flex support and tell them you have overtime, they say ‘oh yeah we will pay it’ but then you have to send email, and after two or three weeks they reply, often saying you are not eligible,” the driver said. Another driver, known only as Chris, who spoke after the decision was made, said at one point he lived in his van because he did not make enough money to rent a home. “I decided to stick it out and the way for me to do that and keep my head afloat was to live in my van for two years,” he said. “Today is a personal thing, that’s why I am feeling emotional … it creates a bit of closure for myself also.” Amazon was contacted for comment.
