5/13/2022,"Hundreds of Queenslanders have fled to higher ground or been rescued from floodwaters with thousands on alert on Friday night as severe thunderstorms lash the state‚Äôs southeast. Intense rainfall has hit Brisbane, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Darling Downs, Moreton Bay, Sunshine Coast, Wide Bay-Burnett, Bundaberg and Gladstone regions, the result of a massive low-pressure trough. More than 170mm has fallen in 24 hours, with some places exceeding 260mm in two days. The unseasonal deluge is Queensland‚Äôs sixth deadly flood since December, which scientists have attributed to a second La Ni√±a weather pattern in two years. ‚ö†Ô∏èLower Brisbane, Bremer Rivers Update: Major flooding occurring along #Warrill #Laidley #LockyerValley Creeks, #BremerRiver. Minor flooding occuring along parts of #LowerBrisbane, minor peaks occuring at #Brisbane at high tide Friday and Saturday. Details https://t.co/UD9exce6Yf pic.twitter.com/rKCVcML1FV The Bureau of Meteorology issued major flood warnings for the Condamine, Logan and Bremer rivers and Warrill, Laidley and Lockyer creeks. On Friday night, the system was moving north over the region between Caboolture and Gladstone, including Maroochydore, Gympie, Bundaberg, Cooroy, Nambour and Rainbow Beach. Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Laura Boekel told reporters on Friday the deluge was an ‚Äúevolving situation‚Äù, with intense rain capable of triggering flash floods and landslides, which could be ‚Äúpotentially life threatening‚Äù. More than 700 roads were cut or affected by floodwaters, including the Bruce Highway near Gin Gin, with Queensland Fire and Emergency Services conducting 20 flood rescues in 24 hours.

Residents are urged to stay off roads,‚Äù the alert said. The worst flooding was around Laidley, Gatton and Grantham in the Lockyer Valley, west of Brisbane, to the south around Beaudesert, and in Warwick, Cecil Plains, Millerman and Killarney on the Southern Downs. About 300 homes were impacted in Laidley where the Lockyer River was gushing down William St, the main thoroughfare, on Friday. Feeling my old home Warwick as well today.. This is some drone vision of OO Madsen Bridge @SouthernDowns #Warwick #floods pic.twitter.com/77jtNeuTb1 The region had downpours of 260mm in the past 48 hours, Lockyer Valley mayor Tanya Milligan said on Friday afternoon. Police knocked on doors and called at least 240 at-risk households, advising them to leave. The Lockyer Valley regional council has eight evacuation centres. Milligan said another 150mm was expected to fall in the next 24 hours, with showers forecast throughout the weekend and into next week also posing the danger of flash flooding. She noted that ‚Äúeven the talk of showers‚Äù would be ‚Äúvery distressing‚Äù for some people in the region who had already been through harrowing flood experiences earlier this year. ‚ÄúIt feels really volatile,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe fact is, that none of us have a crystal ball to give precise locations and how much rainfall, we are actually going to get. But if we were to get a storm cell and have a large velocity, in a small amount of time, to fall on a particular areas, we will be in a whole heap of pain. We are absolutely saturated, this catchment.‚Äù Milligan said residents were issued an emergency warning at 3am Friday, with Grantham‚Äôs flood siren sounding four times between 4am and 5am, and again at 8am. ‚ÄúIt was probably a nasty way to wake people up,‚Äù she said. The mayor said more people likely fled their homes and sought shelter with family and friends. As of about 1pm, Milligan said emergency services had executed six swift water rescues, four of which were for people in flood waters, and two of those were medical episodes. South East Queensland UHF Emergency Service Team founder Shane Barnes said he had been shocked by the intensity of the weather. ‚ÄúStarted my emergency services career and did high schooling in Laidley. Never in my life I would imagine so much water in William Street,‚Äù he tweeted on Friday. The Scenic Rim Council issued an emergency alert warning that multiple roads were cut by the flooding Logan River. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the rain wasn‚Äôt as constant and intense as downpours that caused catastrophic floods in February, but it would linger into Saturday. The Brisbane River was not expected to rise above a minor flood level, but the city council opened sandbagging stations and parts of Rocklea and Oxley were inundated on Friday afternoon. Deputy Police Commissioner Steve Gollschewski urged residents to pay attention to flood warnings and to keep in touch with their families and friends. He also said there had been a number of ‚Äúavoidable rescues‚Äù since the rain began, and urged people not to drive through floodwaters. ‚ÄúWe have lost far too many lives on our roads this year and in previous events,‚Äù Gollschewski said.

5/13/2022,"Well into a career that encompasses poetry, memoir and projects such as her 2017 collection of quotable fragments 300 Arguments, the American author Sarah Manguso has turned to the novel. Very Cold People is also composed of short sections, compiled like witness testimony by a young girl called Ruthie, as she grows up in the fictional town of Waitsfield, Massachusetts, somewhere near Boston. Ruthie and her family don‚Äôt belong there, she tells us in the first sentence; it is a town for people whose ancestors came over with the pilgrims to settle in that violently snowy part of the new world. The very cold people of the title refers not only to the inhabitants of this icy region, but to Ruthie‚Äôs own parents. At the outset they seem merely bohemian and thrifty, buying her toys secondhand and her clothes at factory outlets, but then we hear about Ruthie‚Äôs mother dredging a fancy wristwatch catalogue out of the dump, ironing its crumpled cover and displaying it on the coffee table, ‚Äújust askew [‚Ä¶] as if someone had been reading it and carelessly put it down, and she corrected its angle when she walked by‚Äù. This is something more than parsimony and closer to a pathological need, in the face of material want, to be perceived in a certain way ‚Äì as offhandedly rich, casual. Her mother, the victim in her youth of some unspecified assault, ‚Äúwas the protagonist of everything‚Äù; Ruthie recalls being told of her own birth: ‚Äúthe doctor said Oh she‚Äôs beautiful [‚Ä¶] and my mother had thought he was talking about her‚Äù. These memories, observed by the child and recalled later by the adult Ruthie, are laid down like clues that accumulate until we get a sense of what we‚Äôre dealing with: people who mock and neglect their daughter, who pay for her piano lessons and then loudly point out her mistakes, who have been so crushed by their own upbringings that they cannot show their daughter any love. ‚ÄúIn all of my earliest memories I am alone in my crib. I have no memories of being held. But I do remember closing my eyes in absolute pleasure while my mother stroked my head. Did she do it more than once? I asked her to do it again, all the time, and she always said no. What unwanted touch did it recall for her?‚Äù The older Ruthie and her friends get, the more it becomes clear that abuse ‚Äì not a word Ruthie ever uses ‚Äì is one of the motors that powers their small town, inflicted on the children by the people who are supposed to protect them: police officers, teachers, parents, coaches, older siblings. In the extraordinary scene in which Ruthie gets up the courage to ask her mother what exactly happened to her, she is deflected with monstrous finality: ‚ÄúIt was clear to me that what had happened to her wasn‚Äôt rare but normal.‚Äù The abuse doesn‚Äôt stop at the victim‚Äôs body; it seeps down the generations and sinks into her children. The ‚Äúshame‚Äù Ruthie feels in her own body like a ‚Äúbirthright‚Äù has no distinct source. It is omnipresent. The containment and even pacing of the short sections preserve these fragments as if in a block of ice. The details of a 1980s childhood are the easiest to recall, because they are the most colourful and least harmful: friendship bracelets and beaded safety pins, Lite-Brites and movie nights with rented videos and everything smelling like strawberries ‚Äì ‚Äústickers, lip gloss, hair‚Äù. But other memories are harder to articulate, because they are more threatening, or because they‚Äôre difficult to put language to. ‚ÄúMy life didn‚Äôt feel as if it had a wound, or a missing piece, or any of the metaphors we used in group therapy [‚Ä¶] It just felt like waiting.‚Äù The small alliances forged by the ‚Äúgirls of Waitsfield‚Äù are the warm living nerve system of the novel. They wait together to grow up, or not; to be liberated, to move elsewhere, to commit their own atrocities or to raise their children with ‚Äúordinary love‚Äù. But the novel is a testament to the marks left by the past from generation to generation, and the frigid world of Waitsfield offers Manguso the perfect metaphor for it: ‚ÄúThe salted snow left white lines on the flagstones, and even if you poured hot water over them and scrubbed, as my mother did each spring, those ghosts of winter never quite disappeared.‚Äù  Very Cold People by Sarah Manguso is published by Picador (¬£14.99).

5/13/2022,"With Top Gun: Maverick blasting into cinemas soon, this is the perfect opportunity to revisit Tom Cruise‚Äôs practice run. Doug Liman‚Äôs 2017 action comedy is ‚Äì by Cruise standards, at least ‚Äì relatively low stakes. Cruise plays Barry Seal, a pilot who in real life became a drug runner for the Medell√≠n Cartel. As refreshing as it is to see Cruise indulge in proper character work (rather than simply playing another heroic cypher) and as zippy as the script is, the big appeal of American Made is the aerial photography. Were it not deliberately overshadowed by the Top Gun series, this would rightly be remembered as one of the all-time-great plane films.Thursday 19 May, 9pm, Film4 Smartly scheduled to cheer up anyone who was disappointed by his Doctor Strange movie, this horror represents Sam Raimi firing on all his silliest impulses. The story, not that there is much of one, follows a young woman fending off a curse that threatens to torture her for three days before ‚Äì that‚Äôs right ‚Äì dragging her to hell. But you don‚Äôt watch a Raimi horror for plot. You watch it for all the gleeful, whiplash-inducing momentum and laugh-out-loud inventiveness. This movie is a rollercoaster ride. Outside the Evil Dead movies, Raimi has never been better.Saturday 14 May, 10pm, BBC Three Lisa Barros D‚ÄôSa and Glenn Leyburn‚Äôs devastating drama is a masterpiece of observation. Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson play a couple who find themselves tested when she is diagnosed with breast cancer. While cancer films can err on the melodramatic ‚Äì or worse, the schematic, using the illness as shorthand for character motivation ‚Äì Ordinary Love never once takes its eye off the ball. If you‚Äôve never been through anything like this, you‚Äôll empathise. But if you have, you will recognise yourself, and that‚Äôs the best possible compliment to give.Sunday 15 May, 10pm, BBC Two Now that he‚Äôs a newly minted TikTok rapper, it might be the right time to look back at one of Theroux‚Äôs most ambitious endeavours. After decades on TV, his first theatrically-released documentary was designed to pitch him straight into the dark heart of an infamous religion. If the goal was for Theroux to disassemble Scientology from the inside, it isn‚Äôt a spoiler to say that the film was a failure. But as a look at one man struggling to land a punch on an intangibly sinister organisation, it ranks among Theroux‚Äôs best.Sunday 15 May, 11:25pm, BBC Two With Spider-Man: No Way Home becoming such a sensation this year, it‚Äôs still faintly miraculous to remember that, pre-Spidey, the only film Jon Watts ever directed was Cop Car. It‚Äôs as small and spare a film as you could imagine ‚Äì two bored kids steal a police car abandoned by a corrupt sheriff, and are forced to outwit his attempts at vengeance ‚Äì but the attention to detail is second to none. Even better, as the evil officer, it features one of Kevin Bacon‚Äôs all-time-greatest performances.Sunday 15 May, 2:15am, Horror Channel After its instantly iconic first entry, the Predator series has been an exercise in diminishing returns. Predator 2 replaced tension with silliness, and you‚Äôd be forgiven for forgetting that 2010‚Äôs dismal Predators was ever made. With 2018‚Äôs The Predator, though, the balance began to reset. Co-written and directed by Shane Black (who had a small part in the first movie), this is the goriest and funniest of the sequels, which (almost) remembers that the key to a good Predator movie involves simply reacting to the mayhem caused by a merciless alien killer. Not perfect, but a step in the right direction.Friday 20 May, 9pm, Film4 The Jackass movies are produced in a manner that always creates a glut of unseen stunts, so a Jackass 4.5 ‚Äì recut and filled with snippets previously left on the floor ‚Äì was always inevitable.

5/13/2022,"Micky Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer. Why? Because he likes to work while being driven round in his Lincoln town car rather than at a desk. How come? Because he hates the restrictions of an office and because characteristics are easier than character, that‚Äôs why. Did you mind when Bergerac did it? Were you ever this picky about Knight Rider? No? Well, you can get behind this car-led David E Kelley adaptation of Michael Connelly‚Äôs 2008 novel The Brass Verdict without any more questions then, can‚Äôt you? Right. Micky (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) is an LA defence attorney who developed an addiction to OxyContin after a terrible surfing accident and multiple operations left him in pain and unemployed. They also left him unable to walk past large bodies of water without staring nobly and handsomely out over them as the camera lingers on his noble, handsome face until it is time for the script to start again. This is one of the less publicised aspects of surfing‚Äôs trauma-led addiction, and while I‚Äôm sure it is a burden for sufferers, it does make a legal drama-cum-thriller quite pleasingly restful. He is pulled back into the legal biz when a prosecutor called Gerry Vincent turns out to have altered his will to leave the Lincoln Watergazer his entire practice, just 10 days before said prosecutor is murdered. A professional job, apparently. Suddenly Micky has no more time to stare meaningfully out over large bodies of water. He has a job to do! Several, in fact. He must deal with a small case every week to satisfy the viewer‚Äôs need for tidy narratives. He must further the overarching story of client Trevor Elliott‚Äôs grand murder trial ‚Äì in which Elliott professes his innocence despite a goodly amount of evidence that he killed his girlfriend and her secret boyfriend after finding them in bed together. He needs to fight the systemic racial and other biases of the American judicial system and navigate relationships with his two ex-wives, one of whom is his office assistant ‚Äì and is engaged to the private eye hired by Haller‚Äôs firm ‚Äì and the other of whom is the prosecuting attorney on the Elliott case. He‚Äôs also got to be a good father to his daughter, Hayley (Krista Warner), and keep up with his recovery. Crivvens! By the end of the first episode, he has exonerated Izzy (Jazz Raycole), a young Black woman and fellow Oxy addict in recovery, who was charged with grand important felony theft type behaviour. Haller employs her as his new chauffeur because she can quip while driving. He has charmed Trevor Elliott (Christopher Gorham) into sticking with him rather than changing to a lawyer who ‚Äì oh, I don‚Äôt know ‚Äì sits at a desk and concentrates for 12 hours a day on saving him from the death penalty, rather than sitting in the back of a car and taking time out to liberate jaywalkers and litterers. He has also started investigating Vincent‚Äôs murder and squeezed in a bonding moment with his daughter. The Lincoln Lawyer (Netflix) will do you no harm, as certainly as it will do you no good. People say things like, ‚ÄúYou know Michael ‚Äì the only thing he likes more than a fight is a fight with one hand tied behind his back,‚Äù and they manage exchanges such as ‚ÄúCan you work with that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI can win with that,‚Äù with straight faces. Haller is frequently told he must be across town in court to defend an innocent man ‚Äúin 41 [or a similarly precise number of] minutes‚Äù, but it‚Äôs OK because he can read the brief in the car, you see? Absolute nonsense, of course, from axle to axle. But you can work with it, even if no one‚Äôs winning here.",Arts/Television & radio,The Lincoln Lawyer review ‚Äì it‚Äôs a modern-day Knight Rider!

5/13/2022,"Like Lana Del Rey‚Äôs goth sister, Ethel Cain eulogises seedy all-American glamour over doomy, expansive pop-rock sounds. Her debut album features breathless depictions of badly behaved men (‚ÄúHe‚Äôs never looked more beautiful on his Harley in the parking lot, breaking into the ATMs‚Äù), grotty but idealised romantic setups, road trips filled with motels, diners and pistols, and the cold glitz of a strip club. Yet, as the title suggests, the album‚Äôs other preoccupation is religion. Cain‚Äôs father was a deacon, and as a teenager she was ostracised from the Southern Baptist church she grew up in after coming out as gay (she later realised she was transgender). On songs such as Family Tree, her tortured relationship with Christianity fuels the most powerful lyrics in an album jam-packed with haunting, densely layered imagery and knotty emotional heft. Beneath Cain‚Äôs evocative, beautifully rendered portraits of dysfunction and pain, the music moves between Americana, industrial noise, 80s bombast, horror-electronica and cool but pretty straightforward pop (you could just about imagine Olivia Rodrigo coming out with something like the sultry anti-war American Teenager). As the album progresses, however, the pop sensibility loosens: Televangelism is an intermittently warped piano instrumental; Ptolemaea recalls Arca‚Äôs fractious, challenging sound. By the end it‚Äôs impossible to ignore the fact that this is a long record with flagging momentum. But it‚Äôs also impossible to ignore this intriguing debut‚Äôs promise.

5/13/2022,"The tenaciously inventive Massachusetts-born guitarist Mary Halvorson swapped classical violin for an electric guitar when she heard Jimi Hendrix at 11, and a biology degree for a life in music when she met avant-jazz composing, sax-improvising legend Anthony Braxton at a college jazz workshop. Halvorson has since forged a 20-year career embracing multiple DownBeat magazine best guitar awards, dozens of albums as a guest or leader, a MacArthur Foundation ‚Äúgenius grant‚Äù and much else. Halvorson‚Äôs current double release, Amaryllis and Belladonna, shows how far this singleminded original has come, and affords a glimpse of how far she may go. Amaryllis was mostly conceived for a six-piece improv band; Belladonna for New York‚Äôs contemporary-classical Mivos string quartet ‚Äì but both sessions confirm how years of jaggedly lyrical solo and ensemble improvising and a quirkily subversive affection for mainstream music (a fondness shared with Braxton) have now nurtured a composer of unpredictable but warmly expressive character. Amaryllis exposes avant-funk, fast bass-walking jazz, jubilant brass choruses and slow-sighing rumination to eloquent improvising from young vibraphone original Patricia Brennan, Latin-jazz trumpet star Arturo O‚ÄôFarrill, the tersely punchy Jacob Garchik (trombone) and Nick Dunston (bass), mercurial drummer Tomas Fujiwara, and Halvorson herself. Belladonna is quieter, but it still buzzes with contrasts: graceful sways of string harmony against Halvorson‚Äôs guitar-chord throb and chattery ascents (Nodding Yellow), slurred whale-song sounds over drifting background hums (Moonburn), squealing note-bends within almost Django Reinhardt-like runs (Flying Song), rollercoaster melody full of hard-accented turns and fast-strummed resolutions (Belladonna). These are new landmarks in Halvorson‚Äôs already inimitable discography. American drummer, vibraphonist and composer Ches Smith adds guitar star Bill Frisell to his trio with violist Mat Maneri and pianist Craig Taborn on Interpret It Well (Pyroclastic Records) ‚Äì a mix of subtle sound-painting, country-bluesy guitar, and some hard-rocking climaxes. Sons of Kemet saxophonist and composer Shabaka Hutchings‚Äô Afrikan Culture (Impulse!) swaps Kemet‚Äôs ecstatic ensemble dances for a studio-layered solo reverie with African koras and mbiras, and Japan‚Äôs ethereally whispering shakuhachi flutes. It‚Äôs an outlet for a private and deeper spirituality in Shabaka (he goes by that name alone now), though there‚Äôs still plenty of visceral excitement in its whirling crescendos. And the quietly virtuosic UK vocalist Brigitte Beraha is at her delicately airborne, rhythmically audacious best with her closely entwined Lucid Dreamers band (including fine saxophonist George Crowley) and some sparing electronic support on the idiomatically wide-ranging Blink (Let Me Out Records).",Arts/Music,Mary Halvorson: Amaryllis/Belladonna review | John Fordham's jazz album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/13/mary-halvorson-amaryllisbelladonna-review-new-landmarks-in-an-inimitable-jazz-discography
5/13/2022,"The spirit of sparky high school comedies, from Never Been Kissed to Mean Girls to Easy A, haunts Netflix‚Äôs junky ‚Äúif you like‚Ä¶‚Äù offering Senior Year, with a progressively deafening reminder of what came before. For where those films had charm, wit and vim, this has a stultifying absence instead, a disappointing and derivative two-hour slog down memory lane. It at least looks like the movies it desperately wants to be grouped together with, a quick tip-off to its origins, made by Paramount before being off-loaded to Netflix. British director Alex Hardcastle, best known for sitcom work, does an impressive job of fooling us into thinking we‚Äôre in safe hands with a slick and poppy aesthetic before the script, from Andrew Knauer, Arthur Pielli and actor Brandon Scott Jones, reminds us that we‚Äôre very much not, the loosely familiar framework of a sturdy studio comedy crumbling with every ill-advised decision made. The illest of all is the choice to cast Rebel Wilson in the lead, an often adept comic performer who works best as quippy support (funny in both Bridesmaids and 2015‚Äôs underrated How to Be Single) but who often struggles in the more substantive spotlight (patchy in 2019‚Äôs rom-com spoof Isn‚Äôt It Romantic). She‚Äôs handed a very specific acting challenge here that demands more than she can really give, playing a woman waking up from a 20-year coma after a cheerleading accident at school. She might look 37 but she‚Äôs got the mind of a 17-year-old (there‚Äôs a knotty psychodrama that could have grown out of this premise) and so her every move must reflect this confusing discordance. Before her lies great examples of actors who have effortlessly managed something similar, from Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30 or Tom Hanks in Big or more recently a surprisingly textured Vince Vaughn in Freaky, but a miscast Wilson never convinces as someone figuring out the intricacies of a new body and new life, a simple, surface-level performance not helped by a script that also doesn‚Äôt fully grapple with the actual day-to-day details or genuine comedy of such a surreal experience. Instead it‚Äôs mere montage fodder ‚Äì confusing Lady Gaga for Madonna, learning how to use Instagram, insisting on a Real World: New Orleans prom theme ‚Äì and so cloying late-stage sentiment, of which there is a lot, is markedly ineffective. There‚Äôs proven comic mileage in comparing the nature of high school life then and now, something 21 Jump Street handled well, the leads forced to reconfigure their ideas of popularity and how to wear a backpack. But here it‚Äôs all far too broad with the film‚Äôs over-egged vision of kombucha-drinking mini-activists who embrace their gender fluidity while trying to combat climate change feeling lazy and a little too mean-spirited, as if they were all written with an exhausted eye-roll. The adult characters don‚Äôt fare that well either although there are enthusiastic turns from Sam Richardson as the old friend with a crush, Happiest Season breakout Mary Holland as the BFF-turned-principal, Justin Hartley as the old jock boyfriend and Zoe Chao trying to wring laughs from some frustratingly un-spiky dialogue as the bitter ex-queen bee. But despite the bloated runtime, the script still doesn‚Äôt find enough time to flesh out any of these dynamics, each missing a handful of vital beats. Tonally, it‚Äôs all over the place, that aforementioned sap curdled together with Wilson‚Äôs trademark crudeness, an R-rated comedy that wants to be both sweet and salty, a balance it never manages to perfect. So dick size jokes and wearied putdowns like butt slut crash up against asinine Live Laugh Love life lessons like ‚Äúwhy fit in when you can stand out?‚Äù and ‚Äúthe perfect life online means nothing when you‚Äôre miserable in real life‚Äù, the film resembling a goody two shoes kid who just learned a dirty word. The film‚Äôs aggressive overload of nostalgia, squarely targeted at a thirtysomething audience, is best summarised by a sequence where Wilson‚Äôs character lovingly re-enacts the video to Britney‚Äôs 1999 hit (You Drive Me) Crazy. There‚Äôs no attempt to add any real humour or any kind of inventive spin to the performance, it just ‚Ä¶ is. That scene, and the film‚Äôs use of pop culture in general, recalls Charles Bramesco‚Äôs incisive review of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, where he noted ‚Äúa peculiar breed of fan more interested in identifying objects than what‚Äôs done with them‚Äù. For those who take pleasure in the performative act of pointing and nodding to show they know what that song or TV show reference is then, there‚Äôs plenty here to annoy whomever you‚Äôre trying to impress, others who demand a little more might feel short-changed. It‚Äôs also indicative of a certain brand of tiresome comedy where we‚Äôre expected to have fun simply because those on screen seem to be but it‚Äôs simply not enough and the ending, with two frenetic musical dance numbers, similarly fails to have the contagious effect the makers seem to think it does.

5/13/2022,"On 25 April, the former Missouri governor Eric Greitens, now running for US Senate, posted a video on Twitter of him and Donald Trump Jr, firing semi-automatic rifles at a range. ‚ÄúStriking fear in the hearts of liberals everywhere,‚Äù the former president‚Äôs son said. In the accompanying post, Greitens wrote: ‚ÄúStriking fear into the hearts of liberals, RINOs, and the fake media.‚Äù Greitens, a former Navy Seal, shared the video even though a woman whom he had an affair with accused him of tying her up and tearing her clothes off without her consent, and his ex-wife, Sheena, accused him of knocking her down and hitting one of their sons hard enough to knock one of his teeth loose, according to an affidavit filed as part of a child custody dispute. She also alleged that he purchased a gun, refused to tell her where it was and threatened to kill himself unless she expressed public support for him. Greitens‚Äô gun-focused messaging is concerning, according to researchers who study links between communication and political violence, not only because more than a third of the mass shooters in recent years also had a history of committing domestic violence, according to a Bloomberg report. But it‚Äôs also part of a significant increase among politicians ‚Äì largely Republicans ‚Äì in recent years in references to guns and threatening language in campaign ads, according to researchers. That rhetoric contributes to polarization in our society and can translate to physical violence, they say. Given the tense political climate, researchers expect rhetoric from rightwing political figures to continue to coarsen and lead to more violence before the pendulum swings back to a less charged time. ‚ÄúViolence is in politics as a violation of the idea that people have an equal say in the political process of choosing their governments and of being able to express themselves freely,‚Äù said Nathan Kalmoe, professor of political communication at Louisiana State University and author of Radical American Partisanship. ‚ÄúClearly this kind of messaging, where you‚Äôre calling out political opponents while you‚Äôre shooting at a gun range, is a kind of a violent threat.‚Äù Since Donald Trump became president in 2016, the number of threats against members of Congress has soared, according to data provided by the Capitol police to news organizations. That year, there were 902 threats against the lawmakers. In 2021, there were 9,600. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to think civilians may need to engage in combat to save America. A majority of Republicans support the possible use of force to preserve the ‚Äútraditional American way of life‚Äù, according to a 2021 George Washington University Politics Poll. Among Democrats the number was 15%. When asked if a time will come when ‚Äúpatriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands‚Äù, 47% of Republicans agreed, as opposed to 9% of Democrats. About one-third of Republicans also agreed that ‚Äúbecause things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country‚Äù, according to a 2021 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute. Among Democrats, the number was 18%. But the use of incendiary speech to rile up supporters in a democracy did not start with Trump. ‚ÄúCertainly, we‚Äôve experienced time periods in the US that were as divisive and as polarized as today,‚Äù James Piazza, professor of political science at Penn State University, said. ‚ÄúIt kind of goes in waves. And if you look at the type of speech and rhetoric that politicians used in those previous eras of polarization and division, they look a lot like what you see today; it‚Äôs dehumanizing speech.‚Äù Trump and other Republicans are using threatening language to tap into anger about the shifting demographics of the United States and the sense that a Christian way of life is coming under threat, according to political scientists. ‚ÄúTrump played into that anger and amplified it and went much further than most Republican leaders, especially the most prominent, had gone in very explicitly making these statements, not just the election rejection, but also the other kinds of anti-democratic statements, including hostility towards various racial, ethnic and religious minority groups,‚Äù said Kalmoe. One key difference between the Trump era and other highly polarized periods is the advent of social media, which amplifies speech by instantly sending it to millions of people and often strips nuance from a statement, according to Helio Fred Garcia, professor of professional development and leadership at Columbia University and the author of Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a giant megaphone that is out there,‚Äù said Piazza, who authored a study on the connection between political hate speech and domestic terrorism. ‚ÄúThere really is a whole new realm of the ability to mobilize people, to radicalize people, to have more fringe voices play an outsized role in national discussions.‚Äù Greitens is not alone among Republicans in using such incendiary language. For example, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, recently told Real America‚Äôs Voice, a media group, ‚ÄúThe Democrats are the party of pedophiles. The Democrats are the party of princess predators from Disney ‚Ä¶ Their identity is the most disgusting, evil, horrible thing happening in our country.‚Äù In interviews, political scientists said such language was occurring mostly but not exclusively on the right. But they struggled to provide examples of Democrats doing the same thing. In 2018, former attorney general Eric Holder, who served in Obama administration, said: ‚ÄúWhen they go low, we kick ‚Äôem. That‚Äôs what this new Democratic party is about.‚Äù ‚ÄúImmediately the right jumped on him and said, ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs provoking violence.‚Äô‚Äù Garcia said. ‚ÄúInterestingly, the same people who said, ‚ÄòNo, Trump isn‚Äôt promoting violence,‚Äô‚Äù criticized Holder. Given the charged political climate, the academics say more violence like ‚Äì or worse than ‚Äì the January 6 Capitol riot is inevitable. Piazza said this wave of divisiveness and polarization is reminiscent of the time before the civil war when ‚Äúyou had similar politician rhetoric to mobilize voters and to demobilize and demonize the other side that resulted in political violence‚Äù. That said, Piazza does not expect something like the civil war to erupt. ‚ÄúWe do actually have pretty strong political institutions in the United States, and we have strong security institutions. The US military is extraordinarily professionalized, and the US military has done an extremely good job of being apolitical,‚Äù he said. Garcia also forecasts more violence. He thought the US could return to a more normal place after the end of Trump‚Äôs presidency but because Trump still insists he won, Garcia thinks it will take more than eight years and further carnage for the pendulum to swing back to a more normal place. To avoid that, Piazza and others call for more regulation of social media. He is encouraged by bipartisan efforts to hold the companies accountable. He hopes the government introduces regulations so that a politician ‚Äútrying to rile people up for political gain or attention, or to raise money, wouldn‚Äôt be able to get away with that on social media. They would have to really watch what they had to say in terms of demonizing others and engaging in hate speech,‚Äù he said. In the meantime, Greitens ranks third in the Republican Senate primary polling but still leads against Democratic candidates, according to FiveThirtyEight. Greitens and his primary opponents did not respond to requests for comment. In the campaign ad, Greitens and Trump switch from the semi-automatic rifles to handguns. It closes with them firing more shots and Greitens saying: ‚ÄúLiberals beware.‚Äù",News/US news,Missouri Senate primary highlights rise of violent rhetoric on the right,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/13/missouri-republicans-violent-rhetoric-eric-greitens
5/13/2022,"Your music has helped me in understanding times of my life and what I thought were ineffable emotions. What records or artists were the first to make a lasting impact on you or helped to immerse you in the musical world? carolinemurray I started listening to a lot of classic records via my parents ‚Äì the Everly Brothers, the Mamas and the Papas, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones ‚Äì but the first records that I found on my own that I connected with deeply were Elastica‚Äôs Elastica, Liz Phair‚Äôs Whip-Smart and Nine Inch Nails‚Äô Pretty Hate Machine. I was in junior high when I first heard them. I was a pretty angsty kid ‚Äì but quietly anxious, a door-slammer ‚Äì and I would blast music so loud and write in my journal. I did not know how to express myself at all, and I‚Äôm still working on it; my journals have turned into my music. Elastica was so driven and playful and sexy, Liz Phair was tough but poetic and I loved her angular guitar playing. I loved the industrial nature of Nine Inch Nails and it was definitely the epitome of teenage angst. I was just like: ‚ÄúWow, maybe I am depressed? I didn‚Äôt even know!‚Äù Your impassioned live rendition of Seventeen continues to burn bright in the memory. Which live performers have left the biggest impression on you? VerulamiumParkRanger Nick Cave is probably No 1. I got to tour with him in 2013 and he completely changed the way I looked at a live performance. The way that he engages with the audience and immerses himself in the crowd ‚Äì it feels like church, it‚Äôs really magical. When I used to engage with audiences, it was more dialogue and banter. Then I stopped doing the jokey part and started to intentionally make eye contact with people. Then it evolved into the height of the set where I do Seventeen: the whole set I‚Äôm trying to think who upfront is the person who needs to hear this tonight, and I‚Äôll pick someone out and will engage with them during that song as much as I can depending on the setup of the stage, and I‚Äôll feel that energy and I‚Äôll pull them in. That‚Äôs definitely something I took from Nick: choose when you do engage and do it really intentionally; you connect with that one person but it also affects everyone around them. Your song with Angel Olsen, Like I Used To, has become one of my desert island discs, and me and my mum frequently belt out the last high note in the car. Apart from Angel, who would be your dream collaborator? EmmasZygoticMynci So many. PJ Harvey, Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor, Beth Gibbons. Geoff Barrow who works with Portishead, who is an amazing producer and drummer. Also I would love to work with Warren Ellis: he‚Äôs such a wizard and lives in so many different sonic universes. Like I Used To was such a joyous collaboration, both musically and visually. I remember you saying your mother always wanted you to write ‚Äúhappy songs‚Äù. Do you feel like she would be happy now? Kirmoblue Whenever my mom hears a song that sounds intense, she‚Äôll be like: ‚ÄúI thought you were doing OK?‚Äù I have to explain all the time that when I write I‚Äôm going through a thing to get it out. I think she‚Äôs understanding that more and more. I‚Äôm nervous for her to hear the new record. But she‚Äôs also proud of what I do. I know she knows I‚Äôm OK even when I do struggle. Did playing Rachel on The OA have any effect on your music, lyrics or stage performance? I know your new album title, We‚Äôve Been Going About This All Wrong, also appeared as a line in The OA, although I understand The OA wasn‚Äôt the actual inspiration for the title. anthonyfarthing I‚Äôm grateful to Netflix and [The OA co-creator and star] Brit Marling for having faith in the only non-actor who was part of the cast; it was my first time acting and I was terrified. I think if it affected my music at all, it‚Äôs just helped me dig deeper emotionally in my lyrics. I don‚Äôt remember that line being in the show and I don‚Äôt know if that has been embellished by others ‚Äì but it‚Äôs definitely taken from the movie The Sandlot, where the kids are trying to get the baseball from the lot next door. It happens to be my son‚Äôs favourite movie and we watched it a million times over quarantine. There‚Äôs a scene where they make this contraption with a vacuum and it explodes in this kid‚Äôs face, and he looks at his friends and says, so deadpan: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been going about this all wrong.‚Äù In the height of Covid, clutching my son and my partner on the couch, feeling completely disconnected from the world, I teared up and wrote it down. There was something about that feeling of: every time we get through this one hump, something else fucking happens ‚Äì there‚Äôs no end in sight. Sometimes you just have to do something differently to feel better. I first heard your music when your song Tarifa was on the Twin Peaks soundtrack (and in the show). What was it like working with David Lynch? KobayashiAndSon I still can‚Äôt believe I was part of that production: to say David Lynch is a legend is not doing him justice; he‚Äôs a visionary. I was really shy and quiet. It was very last minute: catch a red-eye from New York, find some place to have a coffee and wait around until you get the call. They were shooting all the artists back-to-back in the Roadhouse. David Lynch was sitting in his director‚Äôs chair with his megaphone, smoking, exactly how you think he would be. Such a gentleman, very specific in his directions. Your songs helped me get over a divorce! Are you more creative when sad or happy? Katkatjusa I tend to write whenever I‚Äôm feeling anything intensely, so that‚Äôs usually from a darker place. How I naturally work is: I‚Äôm feeling something intensely, I play and I sing stream-of-consciously and record for 10 minutes without making it about anything. I‚Äôll listen back days, weeks, months later and try to understand what it was I was going through at the time. Ninety-nine per cent of what I do I don‚Äôt share: sometimes it is too dark and sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Epic was the first album of yours that I heard and it‚Äôs remained a favourite ever since. What made you decide to revisit it and release Epic Ten? Splazsh Funnily enough it was my partner, who is also my manager. He was like: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming up on an anniversary of Epic, that‚Äôs such a big deal, you should do something for it.‚Äù I was like: ‚ÄúDoes anyone care? It feels like I‚Äôm tootin‚Äô my own horn.‚Äù But the more I talked to people about it they were like: 10 years is a big deal, that‚Äôs a real mile marker for any artist. The album was remastered and then there were covers [of the original tracks] by some of my favourite artists, old and new. I‚Äôm so floored that they wanted to do it because it‚Äôs a lot to ask ‚Äì for all of them to have made the time and made such beautiful versions, I‚Äôm still really dumbfounded. You joined Fountains of Wayne [for a tribute show] when Adam Schlesinger sadly died in the early days of the pandemic. I always thought they should have been a huge band as they wrote some sublime songs. Which other artist(s) do you think didn‚Äôt, or don‚Äôt currently, get the success they deserve? ArthurSternom I‚Äôm a Jersey kid so it meant a lot to be asked; we had a mutual friend in Sarah Silverman and lots of other mutual friends through people I work with. It was a challenge because I don‚Äôt play bass in front of people and I hadn‚Äôt ever done a livestream in that way. And it was emotional because it was mourning someone everyone in my circle admired so deeply. I never got to meet him, but everyone I knew spoke so highly of him. I have so many friends who I think have the best bands ever but nobody knows them: Forest Fire, Scary Mansion, Heron Oblivion. There‚Äôs a band from Chicago called Speck Mountain, they‚Äôre really incredible. I think there is a total randomness [to who makes it] sometimes. Bands that don‚Äôt want to tour, that‚Äôs a huge part of it; unfortunately you‚Äôre very reliant on touring to sell your records. I also think the artist has to be driven, no matter what. Some people lose their drive after a while, which is totally understandable because it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm in my 40s and I think I‚Äôm doing well but it‚Äôs still a constant battle. I feel like I have to put myself out there all the time. I‚Äôm in awe of your productivity. How do you manage so many different creative projects? laurasnapes Learning how to use a Google calendar and then setting parameters and goals and deadlines ‚Äì I thrive on deadlines. Becoming a mother and having to work within schedules, you learn to maximise your time. [My son is] only in school for this long and when he‚Äôs home, I can‚Äôt do any of it; no offence to him, it‚Äôs just true. He needs my attention, he needs my partner‚Äôs attention. He‚Äôs an only child, and we want to be there for him. Every Time the Sun Comes Up is one of my all-time favourite album closers. Is it difficult to decide on songs‚Äô positions in an album? peasywease Sequencing is so hard. There are songs that don‚Äôt make it because of the way I transition from one song to another. It‚Äôs like, song number eight has to be more upbeat and lighthearted after this really intense setup; there are two songs that could fill this role and I have to pick between the two. And it breaks my heart sometimes when songs don‚Äôt make the record because we use them later as B-sides and people assume that they‚Äôre fluff. So when I was planning the new [album] rollout I was like: I‚Äôm going to take songs that would be considered B-sides and release them ahead of the record so that people think something‚Äôs coming but I‚Äôm not giving anything away, either. Riesling might be my favourite grape, particularly German producers. Do you have a favourite? Gassy_Jack [Working as a sommelier] was my first job in New York, but I‚Äôm out of the game. I had to stop working in wine because I felt I was becoming more of a snob than just a wine drinker. And I‚Äôm trying to curb my drinking so I try not to have it around all the time ‚Äì because I will drink a bottle. There‚Äôs two I really love, one is Pineau d‚ÄôAunis, a very light, very feminine, floral grape. The other one is Cab Franc, tends to be on the cleaner side, fairly affordable, sleek, peppery. They‚Äôre good with food, they‚Äôre not overpowering; they won‚Äôt stain your lips.

5/13/2022,"The NFL released its full 2022 schedule on Thursday night to add to what‚Äôs been a rollicking and unpredictable offseason. Here‚Äôs a lookahead to what should be some of the most entertaining matchups of the upcoming season. Buffalo Bills at LA Rams (Thursday, 8.20pm ET) The defending Super Bowl champions open against quarterback Josh Allen and the Bills to christen the 2022 season in Los Angeles. After helping the Rams win it all in 2021, linebacker Von Miller signed a six-year, $120m contract with Buffalo. Los Angeles will welcome wide receiver Allen Robinson, who inked a three-year, $46.5m deal to join quarterback Matthew Stafford‚Äôs arsenal. Cleveland Browns at Carolina Panthers (Sunday, 1pm ET) After missing the entire 2021 season, quarterback Deshaun Watson will debut for the Browns after the team signed him to a five-year, $230m contract. Cleveland inked Watson to the splashy deal, which includes $80m guaranteed, after he was cleared of criminal sexual assault charges. Twenty-two women have filed civil complaints against Watson for various forms of sexual coercion during massage appointments. Denver Broncos at Seattle Seahawks (Monday, 8.15pm ET) In his first game as the Broncos quarterback, Russell Wilson returns to Seattle to battle the franchise he led to eight playoff appearances and a Super Bowl victory. It will also be the ESPN debut of Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, who left Fox in the offseason to sign five-year deals with to become the new leads of Monday Night Football. LA Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (Thursday, 8.15pm ET) The AFC West showdown will be the first Thursday Night Football game streamed exclusively by Amazon Prime, which signed a 10-year deal to gain exclusive rights in March 2021. The Chargers will send star linebacker Khalil Mack, who they acquired from Chicago in an offseason trade, after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Kansas City Chiefs at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Sunday, 8.20pm ET) The most successful quarterback in NFL history meets his potential successor for the fifth time. Tom Brady and Mahomes have split their first four matchups and will meet for the first time since the Buccaneers routed the Chiefs, 31-9, in Super Bowl LV. Buffalo Bills at Kansas City Chiefs (Sunday, 4.25pm ET) After providing the most thrilling game of the 2021 season in the AFC divisional playoffs, the Bills return to Kansas City in mid-October for a rematch of one of the best games of the decade. This late-afternoon blockbuster is arguably the biggest game of the season and a potential conference title game preview. Indianapolis Colts at Tennessee Titans (Sunday, 1pm ET) After entering the playoffs as the AFC‚Äôs top seed last season, the Titans were upset by the Bengals in the AFC divisional round. Tennessee added wide receiver Robert Woods from the Rams before stunning most experts by trading star wide receiver AJ Brown to the Philadelphia Eagles on the first day of the 2022 NFL draft. After missing the playoffs last season, the Colts traded for longtime Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan to try and lead them to the top of the AFC South. Washington Commanders at Philadelphia Eagles (Monday, 8.15pm ET) Carson Wentz, tabbed by the Eagles with the No 2 overall pick in the 2016 NFL draft, was once Philadelphia‚Äôs franchise centerpiece. Now he‚Äôs on his third team in two years since getting traded by the Colts in March. Philly‚Äôs notoriously surly fans will no doubt be giving him an earful. Kansas City Chiefs at Cincinnati Bengals (Sunday, 4.25pm ET) If Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes wants to avenge his loss in last season‚Äôs AFC championship game, he will have to do it on the road in Cincinnati. It‚Äôs one of 10 playoff rematches on the schedule this year, including the instances where teams will face each other multiple times as division rivals. Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Arizona Cardinals (Sunday, 8.20pm ET) The best of three Christmas Day matchups will be a battle between the 45-year-old Brady and a star quarterback 20 years his junior in Kyler Murray. After starting the 2021 season with a 10-2 record, the Cardinals dropped four of their final five games before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Rams at home.",Sport/Sport,NFL 2022 schedule: the 10 must-watch games of the upcoming season,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/13/nfl-2022-season-best-games-to-watch
5/13/2022,"Our bin gets really smelly a few days into the week, but Abi refuses to empty it until it‚Äôs full My partner, Abi, refuses to take our bin out before Sundays. She‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúNo, we use only one bin bag a week, and we must wait until it‚Äôs full before it goes outside‚Äù. This habit really grinds my gears for a few reasons. First, the bin starts to smell really quickly. Even though we have a large bin with a lid, the stench of rotting garbage starts emanating from it halfway through the week. Who wants to deal with that? Second, the stinginess. Abi believes she‚Äôs being economical by waiting until the bin is full, but what is she really saving? Five, 10p a bag? I‚Äôm more than happy to give her the money for it if it means we don‚Äôt have to deal with the smell of the rubbish. For me it‚Äôs a no-brainer. Recently things got really smelly after we disposed of a lot of food waste and plastic containers that had had chicken breasts in them. I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking the bins out.‚Äù Abi tried to stop me. Her defence was, ‚ÄúThe bin is barely full. You‚Äôre being wasteful.‚Äù But the smell was grossing me out. The bin is in the corner of the kitchen and I hate cooking when there is rotting rubbish right near me. Every time we opened it to put some more rubbish in, it would stink out the whole room. I argued that she was making us suffer for no reason. In the end, I took the old one outside, but she kept saying it was unnecessary. But in my mind you don‚Äôt have to wait until the bin is overflowing. If it smells, take it out. Abi is stingy about a lot of things. She never wants to throw away food and always insists on saving bits of leftover dinner, which we never eat. She also hates throwing out books and games she hasn‚Äôt touched in years. I think it‚Äôs how she was raised: to save every penny and never waste anything. But I‚Äôm more about personal happiness. If something is causing you stress, throw it out! There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind that I‚Äôm correct. If there is a putrid scent coming from the rubbish bin in your home, empty it. Abi needs to realise you can‚Äôt put a price on happiness ‚Äì and foul smells make me very unhappy. It‚Äôs a total waste of money to use more than one bin bag a week, especially as the smell isn‚Äôt that bad The bins are a point of contention in our relationship. We got together three years ago and moved in with each other a year later. That‚Äôs when I began to notice that Chioma is a lot more wasteful than me. She will chuck milk out if it‚Äôs one day past the sell-by date. She doesn‚Äôt ever want to freeze leftovers. And with the kitchen bin, she‚Äôs determined to change it whenever there‚Äôs a slight smell. Any little inconvenience and it‚Äôs, ‚ÄúOh, we have to change the bin again.‚Äù But in my opinion, there‚Äôs always going to be a bit of an odour when you keep rubbish inside the house. It‚Äôs normal. Chioma will be getting bin bags out several times a day, even when there‚Äôs no smell. I actually think she‚Äôs just scared of a possible odour, so she prematurely takes the bins out before there‚Äôs even a chance of it festering. I tell her, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being a bit over the top. There‚Äôs not even anything in that bin,‚Äù but she just ignores me. We recycle cardboard and cans, but we don‚Äôt have a food waste bin so a lot of our leftovers go into the main bin. That probably adds to Chioma‚Äôs anxiety, but I never think it‚Äôs that bad. Also, our living room and dining area are separate, so if the smell is bad, we only ever have to endure it while we are in the kitchen. Our bin also has a sturdy lid. Chioma exaggerates when she says that it stinks every day. I‚Äôve been raised to be a bit more conscientious about money. Chioma says I‚Äôm too frugal but I think it‚Äôs ridiculous to be going through multiple plastic bags a week when we could just use one. I‚Äôve pretty much refused to take the kitchen bin out unless it is at capacity and it is a Sunday. Of course, I would make an exception if there was a really terrible smell, but that never happens. When Chioma complains about the bins, I remind her that the price of 50 black bin liners is ¬£2.50 and rising. The cost of living is hitting us all hard. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong here at all. Should Abi empty the kitchen bin more often? While there‚Äôs nothing wrong with waiting for a bin to be full before putting it out, food waste does smell. Some people are more sensitive to bad smells than others, and it seems Abi isn‚Äôt taking Chioma‚Äôs feelings into consideration.Eira, 52 Abi is hinting at a compromise ‚Äì a separate food waste bin that can be disposed of every three or four days would eliminate smells. No need to throw refuse away every day, but as you prepare meals in the kitchen, the smells in that room shouldn‚Äôt put you off from entering it either.Tristan, 33 Abi is guilty: no one likes smelly rubbish in the kitchen. However, wasting food isn‚Äôt good and Chioma should be on board with Abi‚Äôs efforts in this area. A smaller bin/smaller bin bags might be a solution to both their needs.Jo, 56 Not only does the stench permeate furnishings and fabrics, it attracts flies and rodents, too. Abi needs to be more aware of Chioma‚Äôs sensitivity to smells, and commit to emptying the bins daily to have a pleasant-smelling home. How about buying a food recycling bin of their own?Chantal, 45 It‚Äôs hard to judge when the evidence seems to differ (is it several times a day, or once a week?) but I‚Äôm leaning towards the prosecution here. Smells, foul odours or the chance of festering all seem worth the 5p it costs to change the bag. Sorry Abi, you‚Äôre guilty!Ali, 33 So now you can be the judge. In our online poll below, tell us: should Abi take out the bin more often?We‚Äôll share the results on next week‚Äôs You be the judge. The poll will close 19 May 9am BST We asked if Chris should soak the dishes before washing up, because his current method annoy his partner Penny. 90% of you said no ‚Äì Chris is innocent10% of you said yes ‚Äì Chris is guilty",Lifestyle/Life and style,You be the judge: should my partner take the bin out more often?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/13/you-be-the-judge-should-my-partner-take-the-bin-out-more-often
5/13/2022,"It is eight years since Luton Town returned to the Football League, a title-winning campaign under John Still in which they racked up 101 points and rattled in 102 goals culminating at Hyde, and a look at the direction of the travel of the two teams helps paint the picture of a quite extraordinary rise. Hyde have just finished 18th in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, the seventh tier, while Luton are two games from a Championship playoff final and three from discovering the glitz of the Premier League, 30 years on from last tasting the top flight. The backbone of the club from those days in non-league remains, from the kit man, Darren Cook, to the goalkeeping coach, Kevin Dearden, the midfielder Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, the legendary chief recruitment officer and assistant manager, Mick Harford, the chairman, David Wilkinson, and the chief executive, Gary Sweet. A series of financial setbacks saw the club deducted 10 points in 2007-08 and a record 30 points by the Football League the following season after entering administration for the third time in nine years. The Championship was the aim when the club was bound for the fifth tier and the target spelled out in the name of the consortium that rescued the club: Luton Town 2020. They arrived at that destination a few months early, helped over the line by Harford after Nathan Jones, who returned as manager two years ago, left for Stoke. From that moment they have pushed to complete the set but they are way ahead of schedule. Sweet acknowledges there is ‚Äúa comedy factor‚Äù around the prospect of the creaking and charismatic Kenilworth Road hosting Premier League matches. If they were promoted, much of the off-season would be spent making their stadium compliant. ‚ÄúThe old girl hasn‚Äôt got much life left in her now but we dearly wish she can entertain top-flight football before she finally expires,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIn the Conference, many thought I had lost my marbles when we spoke about the Premier League being our target. Why not? If you don‚Äôt reach for the top how do you know how far you‚Äôve travelled?‚Äù Jones has a tight-knit bond with his players and a togetherness runs through the club. There is a determination to grasp their chance. ‚ÄúThey always believed they would get back to the Championship,‚Äù says Still, who left the club midway through 2015-16, Jones his permanent successor. ‚ÄúI always felt they believed that was where they belonged. It is fantastic for the club, who felt they were wronged many years ago when they got bombed out of the league and I think responded in the only way you can respond, which is on the pitch. They could be sitting halfway down the league [Championship] and going: ‚ÄòWell, we‚Äôve done the job we set out to do.‚Äô But all of a sudden there‚Äôs a bigger thing tapping them on the shoulder and I‚Äôm not sure they would have believed they would be doing that.‚Äù Luton‚Äôs achievement is all the more remarkable given their modest resources. Their recruitment has been shrewd. They have a bottom-three budget smaller than some of the teams chugging along in League One, and their squad was assembled for less than ¬£1.5m. Kal Naismith, Reece Burke, Jordan Clark and Gabriel Osho are among those who have thrived since arriving on frees. Elijah Adebayo, signed from Walsall last year, and Harry Cornick, who joined from Bournemouth in 2017, have impressed in attack. ‚ÄúRecruitment doesn‚Äôt start with the players, it starts with recruiting the right people to attract the right players,‚Äù Sweet says. ‚ÄúNathan is clearly vital to this, and very good at it, but I‚Äôd argue that it‚Äôs the wider team of great people we have working in every office, every changing room, every kitchen and around every square inch of the club that attracted him back home. Our environment starts with the kit man and the maintenance guy or the team in the shop or ticket office. Without them, we‚Äôre nothing.‚Äù It is a similar story at Huddersfield, the visitors in the playoff first leg on Friday, whose squad cost about ¬£2.3m. Both have defied the notion that financial muscle is the only way to compete. Mpanzu could make history by becoming the first player to represent the same club in every division from non-league to the Premier League. Dan Potts, who Still signed in League Two, also remains. ‚ÄúWhile other clubs trade in pounds as their only currency to gain points and silverware, we know that while it‚Äôs our desire to run a sustainable model, we can‚Äôt compete with that so we create different currencies that we believe are just as important as money,‚Äù Sweet says. The club is in rude health compared with the one the consortium of Luton supporters inherited in 2008. They hope to move into a new stadium, Power Court, in three years, with detailed plans set to be submitted to local planning officers. ‚ÄúIt is every credit to everyone who stuck with the club through very dark days,‚Äù Still says. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just poking their heads through now to find the proper sunshine of the Premier League. Whether they do it or not is immaterial. The progress they have made so far is brilliant and if it doesn‚Äôt happen this time, who‚Äôs to say it won‚Äôt happen next year? If they manage to do it and someone wrote a film about it, they‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòMmm, yeah, that‚Äôs got to be fiction.‚Äô It is fairytale stuff, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù",Sport/Football,Luton Town: from non-league to the brink of a Premier League fairytale,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/luton-town-from-non-league-to-the-brink-of-a-premier-league-fairytale
5/13/2022,"Magnus Carlsen has not competed on chess.com for more than a year, since the website is in direct competition with chess24.com, which is owned by the Play Magnus Group. So it was a shock when the world champion appeared unannounced on the starting line for this week‚Äôs Titled Tuesday, an 11-round blitz event with free entry to all internationally titled players. The Norwegian used 1 b3 and 2 Bb2 (Larsen Opening) in every game as White, and 1‚Ä¶b6 and 2‚Ä¶Bb7 (Owen Defence) in every game as Black. He still outclassed the field with 10/11, conceding just two draws and defeating world top-50 opponents Jeffery Xiong, Grigoriy Oparin and Parham Maghsoodloo. Meanwhile, the 31-year-old‚Äôs long-standing rival and popular streamer Hikaru Nakamura has released his thoughts on whether Carlsen will decline to defend his title against the winner of the eight-player Candidates scheduled for Madrid in June-July. Nakamura‚Äôs ‚Äúno way!‚Äù conclusion is based principally on Carlsen‚Äôs need to do more to confirm his status as clear all-time No 1 ahead of Garry Kasparov. Alireza Firouzja, the youngest ever 2800-rated player at age 18 and favourite for the Candidates, took a five-month break from classical tournaments before returning as top seed in the elite Superbest Bucharest tournament which ends on Saturday. Bucharest is the first leg of the 2022 Grand Tour, which includes rapid/blitz tournaments in Warsaw and Zagreb before the Sinquefield Cup at St Louis in August. Asked about his absence, Firouzja replied that he had been ‚Äúliving the life and preparing for the Candidates‚Äù, but his results at Bucharest have been subdued. One win, one loss, 3.5/7, plus several errors and miscalculations. Next month in Madrid could be a different story. Wesley So and Levon Aronian were joint leaders in Bucharest with 4.5/7 two rounds rounds before the finish. So took a clear lead in round four with a neat tactic, while Aronian‚Äôs round-six miniature ended in a coup which is featured in this week‚Äôs puzzle. Wesley So v Ian Nepomniachtchi, Bucharest 2022. So is a pawn up, but with opposite coloured bishops it looks hard to win. What was So‚Äôs winning move? See puzzle solution below for the answer. There was a surprise in Richard Rapport v Leinier Dom√≠nguez when the Hungarian chose 1 e4 e5 2 Ne2?! (Alapin Opening) to avoid his opponent‚Äôs 2 Nf3 Nf6 Petroff, while Fabiano Caruana became the latest top player to use the Dilworth, a system worked out by a Cheshire railway clerk in the 1940s which still remains viable for both sides. India‚Äôs Dommaraju Gukesh, 15, winner of a trio of first prizes in Spain, and the USA‚Äôs Hans Niemann, 18, winner of the Capablanca Memorial in Havana and of last week‚Äôs Sigeman annual in Sweden, are the rising stars of the moment, with ratings fast approaching 2700. Next week‚Äôs Sharjah Open, with a large prize fund and at least 40 GMs rated above 2600, will test the new generation. Some feared for England‚Äôs long standing No 1, Michael Adams, when the 51-year-old had to take on both Niemann and Arjun Erigaisi, also 18, at Malm√∂, but Adams played a fine tournament, one of his best in recent years, with six steady draws then a final round victory which took him to shared second prize and featured a winning advance of Harry the h-pawn.In contrast the other veteran, Alexei Shirov, finished last. Many European cities have outside chess in parks and cafes, and London joined in on Thursday with chess tables in Russell Square Gardens. The popular all-day Chessfest in Trafalgar Square will also return on Sunday 17 July. 3815: 1...Na4! and the threat Rd8 mate gains decisive material. So v Nepomniachtchi: 1 Bxf7+! resigns.

5/13/2022,"Every day, for the past 20 years, Joyce Naserian has laid out her handmade curios near an entrance to the Masai Mara park to sell to passing tourists. Her earnings have helped the 46-year-old feed and educate all four of her children. In northern Kenya, about 1,200 semi-nomadic women earned more than 9m Kenyan shillings (¬£62,000) selling beadwork to visitors at 43 community wildlife conservancies in 2020. Just as it was Naserian in the Mara, selling the beadwork was a solid money earner for these women. But that was before Covid. The collapse of eco-tourism during the pandemic has spelled disaster for conservation initiatives and livelihoods in Kenya and beyond. Cuts to budgets and staff, reduced salaries and stalled development and education projects have plunged communities into poverty, leading to a rise in poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Reuters reported that in the first three months of 2020, the African continent lost $55bn (¬£44bn) in travel and tourism revenues ‚Äì funds that go towards running conservation programmes that benefit local communities. Kenya‚Äôs government has relaxed a raft of travel restrictions, but the return of international tourists has been slow, while concerns about carbon emissions from long-haul air travel may be putting people off flying into conservation areas. ‚ÄúIt is a real struggle for survival,‚Äù says Daniel Sopia, head of Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. ‚ÄúWomen who relied solely on beadwork were badly affected as there was not a single tourist coming to the Mara at the height of Covid-19 restrictions. Household income dropped significantly and they had to rely on food from well-wishers.‚Äù The 15 wildlife conservancies that Sopia heads comprise individual blocks of land owned by Maasai people. The landowners lease the land, covering 14,0426 hectares (347,000 acres), to safari camps and lodges, which pay fees that fund projects providing water, healthcare and education, as well as setting up small businesses. In return, the 14,500 landowners protect biodiversity within the Mara ecosystem while preserving their traditional lifestyle. Four years before the pandemic, the conservancies contributed almost 120m Kenyan shillings to social programmes in the region. Two years ago, payments to landowners fell by 50%, forcing conservancies to scale back operations and focus on priorities such as allowances to wildlife rangers. Sopia and his team had to scramble to prevent the total collapse of conservation programmes. ‚ÄúConservancies remained operational throughout the pandemic despite the lack in tourism income,‚Äù says Sopia. ‚ÄúWe were fortunate to mobilise some resources from development partners and private foundations. These helped to cover rangers‚Äô salaries, food rations, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. ‚ÄúWe hope the arrangement will be in place till June 2022 as we slowly wean the conservancies off such aid,‚Äù he says. Some foreign organisations are now making a comeback after a two-year hiatus. In March 2022, UK charity Tusk brought together conservation professionals from across Africa for a symposium in Masai Mara to help organisations diversify fundraising and build resilient units. Since 1990, Tusk has raised more than ¬£80m towards conservation projects across more than 20 African countries and helped to protect more than 40 threatened species. Tusk‚Äôs upcoming Wildlife Ranger Challenge seeks to raise money for rangers whose pay was slashed in the pandemic. ‚ÄúThe last two years have been extremely tough for everyone. The conservation sector in particular has had to endure huge losses, dramatic cutbacks in operating budgets, and, sadly, redundancies,‚Äù says Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive. Wanjiku Kinuthia, strategyhead at Maliasili, hopes the renewed interest in broadening discussions about African conservation will boost small organisations that are often left out of big decisions, despite being closest to the vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of a collapsing environment. ‚ÄúThey often miss out on global dialogues,‚Äù says Kinuthia, whose group supports about 20 other organisations in seven countries, including smaller ones that lack the networks to make their voices heard. ‚ÄúThey do not understand how the media works or how to tell their stories. We can be catalysts of change for such grassroots organisations.‚Äù Involving communities in conservation would safeguard the 65% of wildlife that lives outside protected areas, she says. ‚ÄúAll people need are tools to help them coexist with animals in the 21st century while benefiting from conservation.‚Äù However, some conservationists say the only way to sustain conservation programmes and avoid disruption is by governments increasing budgets to the sector, a challenge considering the current low levels of state investment. Dickson Kaelo, who heads the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, says African countries depend on foreign donors to fund development and conservation is no exception. ‚ÄúThere is no single answer to cutting off foreign aid,‚Äù says Kaelo. ‚ÄúThere are no government incentives for setting up a conservancy to protect an elephant that walks all over destroying life and property. ‚ÄúIf you are in the farming sector, you can get a loan to buy a tractor, but there is no institution that gives loans for those who want to invest in protecting wildlife, and while a person buying a vehicle to ferry tourists gets some tax rebates, we get no such benefits when buying a truck for wildlife rangers.‚Äù He adds: ‚ÄúThe government is creating laws that hamper conservation, including the Natural Resources (Benefits Sharing) Bill, with a formula that will see those in conservation give 80% of their proceeds to government and a paltry 12.8% to local communities. In addition, the government requires that you come up with a management plan, a strategic and environmental study, multiple registration procedures and other permits before setting up a private conservancy. If you want to lease land you have to pay 2% stamp duty for the entire period, say for 20 years, and pay that upfront. Why don‚Äôt we see such laws when someone wants to cut down a tree?‚Äù Kaddu Sebunya, chief executive at the African Wildlife Foundation says Africans must be exposed to the benefits of wildlife and wild lands so they can lead on conservation. A starting point would be to make tourism more accessible, he says, ‚Äúas it is easier for someone in New York or Sydney to book a tour to Africa than someone living in Harare or Lagos.‚Äù. ‚ÄúBuilding our domestic and regional tourism market will be a stepping stone to increasing the African voice for conservation. While millions of Africans traverse the continent to travel for business, how can these numbers be translated to nature tourists? ‚ÄúData from Unctad [UN Conference on Trade and Development] indicates that four out of 10 international tourists in Africa come from the continent, and this begs the question, ‚Äòis our product marketing catering to the four Africans?‚Äô It is high time for a shift in mindset,‚Äù says Sebunya.

5/13/2022,"It is 16 August 2020 and Alan Bennett and his partner are on their customary evening walk. Given that 86-year-old Bennett is hobbled with rheumatoid arthritis, this is hardly an ambitious excursion ‚Äì literally three minutes ‚Äúround the block‚Äù of their north London street. Suddenly the windows fly open and neighbours start banging pots and clapping. Since he needs to lean heavily on his walking stick, Bennett is unable to join in, but he compensates by standing in the street and nodding enthusiastically. Until, that is, the horrible thought strikes him that it must look as if he is acknowledging the applause, perhaps even trying to generate it himself. To disavow this, he tries shaking his head, ‚Äúbut this just looks like modesty‚Äù. It is a typical Bennett moment, part gentle social comedy part revelation about the self-delusions of the ego. It probably never occurred to the hollering neighbours that their joyful noise for the NHS might be misconstrued as directed at one elderly, slightly famous playwright. Bennett‚Äôs diaries, which he has been publishing since the early 1980s, are full of these ‚Äúabsurd and inexplicable‚Äù moments. The pandemic is the background and, indeed, the foreground to this latest and most slender tranche of journals, which runs to a mere 64 pages. The entries begin on 24 February 2020, with the diarist chipper about the unlikelihood of the new virus in Milan having much effect on London living, and chunter on to the autumn of 2021 when the crisis appears to be in the rearview mirror (we know, although he does not, that Omicron is lurking in the wings). The fact that Bennett‚Äôs new normal now involves being met by helpful staff with a wheelchair whenever he travels between Leeds and King‚Äôs Cross tells us just how frail he has become in the intervening 18 months. It doesn‚Äôt stop him, though, keeping a beady eye on the competition. In November 2020 he notices that the Queen, nearly 10 years his senior, is able to walk backwards when laying a wreath at the Cenotaph. The fact that Her Majesty could probably not manage this today is a reminder of how swiftly treacherous advanced old age can be. It is not all doom and gloom. On 26 March of that first year, Nicholas Hytner rings with the exciting news that the BBC would like to record a new version of Bennett‚Äôs Talking Heads monologues of 1988 because it is exactly the sort of thing that could be done on Zoom. The director pops round later that day to discuss details, which he is obliged to semaphore from the other side of the street. Bennett, in turn, worries that weeks of social isolation have robbed him of the power of speech. On the phone to the optician about his broken glasses, he finds that he has lost the words, and his partner has to take over. Later, arriving at the vaccination centre for his first jab, Bennett firmly announces that he is here ‚Äúfor the virus‚Äù (in his defence, he points out that both of them are ‚Äúv words‚Äù). If Bennett‚Äôs speech can be jumbled, his writing remains as deft and seamless as ever, especially when dealing with that most numinous of subjects, his childhood in working-class Leeds. Contemplating the current regime of hand-washing and elbow-bumping pitches him straight back to the 1940s when the unfortunate family next door succumb to TB. Young Alan was strictly forbidden from setting foot in this den of contagion until, lured by Mrs Sherwood‚Äôs cloud-like yorkshire pudding, he decides to risk it: ‚ÄúIt was as if I‚Äôd signed my own death warrant.‚Äù There is something about this early lesson in the danger that other people pose that contributes to the impression Alan Bennett always gives of having been primed for apartness. He recounts a telling anecdote from 1941 in which the whole family went on a Sunday fishing expedition in the country. Bennett and his brother wore their school caps, his mother her swagger coat, and his father the suit with the good trousers. Having failed to catch anything ‚Äì were they even in the right place? ‚Äì the unlikely sportsmen take themselves stoically home. ‚ÄúWe never joined in, got the gear, looked the part,‚Äù recalls Bennett and it is clear that he is thinking of more than just fishing. Where this tortured restraint does not reach, though, is into Bennett‚Äôs ethical worldview which remain as richly communitarian as ever. The news that the cast and crew of the new Talking Heads series have agreed to take only a nominal fee and donate the profits to the NHS gives him a rare rush of pleasure in a world dominated by the bleak economics of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. More than ¬£1m is raised, an act of generosity that reaches far beyond the awkward performance of a Thursday night community clap.  House Arrest: Pandemic Diaries is published by Profile (¬£6.99).

5/13/2022,"Trish has never been seen in public before. Nor have Sharon, Janet, Debbie, Denise, Donna, Jacqui, Joanne, Kim, Lorraine, Mandy, Paula, Sandra or Tina. But for the next two weeks, these 14 artworks by the pop star Robbie Williams and his creative partner Ed Godrich will be on display at Sotheby‚Äôs in central London. Their curious titles ‚Äì all women‚Äôs names that were popular back when Williams was a Stoke-on-Trent schoolboy ‚Äì are not the artworks‚Äô only common factor. The large-scale black and white images, the fruits of a five-year collaboration, are strikingly thematic. ‚ÄúRobbie and Ed refer to the paintings as a family of work,‚Äù said Hugo Cobb, a contemporary art specialist at Sotheby‚Äôs. ‚ÄúThey are all created in the same visual language. But when you stand in front of them, you see they have a different character. Each picture definitely has a specific visual mood. ‚ÄúCoherence, ambition and authenticity are the three things I think of when I stand in front of these works.‚Äù Another painting from the same group, Beverly, was sold by Sotheby‚Äôs last month for ¬£40,000 ‚Äì double the top end of the pre-sale estimate ‚Äì to a private foundation in Central America. Williams said the pair were now ‚Äúready to share our creative vision with the world‚Äù. He wanted people to ‚Äúfeel a sense of positivity ‚Ä¶ to be intrigued, to feel curious, and spot new characteristics every time they look back at each painting.‚Äù Using the moniker Williams Godrich, the collaborators painted the 14 works on huge polystyrene panels ‚Äì a medium that gives them a ‚Äúunique texture‚Äù, said Cobb ‚Äì building up layers of detail. ‚ÄúAll the characters are in our head and come to life as the painting develops,‚Äù said Godrich. ‚ÄúSometimes a character will emerge by mistake, or part of a figurine will happen by chance because of the direction of a particular brushstroke. ‚ÄúRobbie might see something completely different when it‚Äôs his turn to draw; that‚Äôs why our work takes on multiple narratives. He‚Äôll add a bit and I‚Äôll add a bit until we end up with a completely unique being.‚Äù According to Williams, the paintings‚Äô titles came about because ‚Äúwe like the obscurity of these names which were highly popular back in the day but are not so common now. For us they are names that define the 1980s, an influential era which has inspired our art.‚Äù In a Sotheby‚Äôs video, he said his interest in art had been sparked by album covers. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realise they were art at the time, I was just intrigued by the images in front of me ‚Ä¶ So I guess my first love of art was through music.‚Äù He and Godrich had formed an ‚Äúart band‚Äù, he added. Art was ‚Äúa great experiment for me to be creative in a different vehicle‚Äù. Williams, who has amassed a huge fortune from record sales and concerts, has built up a personal art collection. This year he sold two works by Banksy for a total of ¬£7m. The sales were intended to free up space to be able to buy ‚Äúnew art from new people‚Äù and help fund his own work, he said. Cobb said the Williams Godrich debut was an exciting moment. ‚ÄúRobbie and Ed are very serious about this. This is not a one-off project ‚Äì they‚Äôve put a huge amount of energy and time into their work. As to their future collectability, it remains to be seen.‚Äù  Black and White Paintings by Robbie Williams and Ed Godrich is at Sotheby‚Äôs, 35 New Bond Street, London W1S 2RP, until 25 May.",Arts/Music,Sotheby‚Äôs debut of Robbie Williams‚Äô art puts Sharon and Trish on show ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/13/robbie-williams-ed-godrich-sothebys-art-exhibition

5/13/2022,"Good morning. The UK is holding negotiations with the EU about parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, and if that feels like deja vu, that‚Äôs because it is. After six years of deadlocks, impasses and stalemates, it feels like politics has gone back to square one. First, the Democratic Unionist party said it would not join the power-sharing assembly at Stormont without changes to the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. Then foreign secretary Liz Truss said yesterday that unless the EU gives way she will have ‚Äúno choice but to act‚Äù during a ‚Äútetchy‚Äù conversation with Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, the vice-president of the European Commission. The decision to contest the protocol has caused some diplomatic alarm: the US is so concerned that it is sending an emergency delegation to London, the Guardian reports today. Officials in Brussels are said to be ‚Äúflabbergasted‚Äù and there‚Äôs even concern within Truss‚Äôs own party. But at least one man is calm. In the Telegraph, former Brexit minister David Frost writes that Boris Johnson should just rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol ‚Äì and even compared it to the prime minister‚Äôs handling of the war in Ukraine. So. A lot going on. To make sense of it all, I spoke to the Guardian‚Äôs Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll. First, here are the headlines. Nato | Finland must apply to join Nato without delay, the country‚Äôs president and prime minister have said. After decades of military non-alignment, the Nordic country made the historic move in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Partygate | More than 100 fixed-penalty notices have now been handed out for breaches of lockdown rules in Downing Street and Whitehall, the Metropolitan police said. Boris Johnson is understood to not be among those in a new set of fines. Climate crisis | The world‚Äôs leading energy economist has warned against investing in ‚Äúcarbon bomb‚Äù oil and gas developments. After the publication of a Guardian investigation, Fatih Birol of the IEA called for a ‚Äúcleaner and more secure energy system‚Äù. Covid | Six people have died amid an ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù spread of fever, North Korean state media has announced, a day after it admitted for the first time ever that an outbreak of Covid had occurred. Politics | Boris Johnson has demanded that ministers reduce their staff to free up cash to spend on the cost of living crisis. 90,000 jobs in the civil service could be cut. It‚Äôs been over two years since Boris Johnson signed the EU withdrawal agreement, and celebrated an achievement which had eluded Theresa May. That victory was rooted in what he claimed was a ‚Äúgreat deal‚Äù for Northern Ireland ‚Äì a special arrangement which avoided a trade-and-customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland by putting one in the Irish Sea instead. The Northern Ireland protocol, as it became known, was presented by Johnson as conclusive. But always lurking was an uncertainty that has arisen again this week. Here‚Äôs a guide to what‚Äôs happening: Brexit is back ‚Äì again Not that it ever really went away. After a hiatus due to the war in Ukraine, negotiations with the EU about the protocol have resumed and foreign secretary Liz Truss has come out swinging, threatening to unilaterally scrap important sections of the protocol if the EU does not show the ‚Äúrequisite flexibility‚Äù. The EU has said previously that there will be severe and immediate consequences, at worst a trade war, if the UK were to go through with something like this. That would have serious consequences for the whole of the UK ‚Äì but especially Northern Ireland, where a new government is yet to form at Stormont after last week‚Äôs elections. Sinn F√©in‚Äôs victory In a historic victory last week, Sinn F√©in became the biggest party in the Stormont assembly, winning 29% of the vote. It‚Äôs a seismic moment for the party, Rory Carroll says, because for the first time in Northern Ireland‚Äôs 101-year history, a nationalist party has emerged triumphant. This victory is largely ‚Äúsymbolic and psychological‚Äù, Rory explains, ‚Äúand in the Northern Ireland context that‚Äôs really important: symbolism has an exaggerated impact‚Äù. Rory calls Sinn F√©in‚Äôs victory ‚Äúa wake up call‚Äù for the DUP, because it will boost Sinn F√©in‚Äôs campaign for a referendum on the unification of Ireland. ‚ÄúNot in the short term,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at least a medium term, five years, probably more before that may happen, if it happens.‚Äù For most people, however, life will continue as normal: ‚Äúthis makes no real meaningful difference in the day to day because Sinn F√©in have been in government for 15 years in Northern Ireland and will continue to be‚Äù. Despite the importance politically for Sinn F√©in‚Äôs leader to move from deputy first minister to putative first minister, the roles have identical powers. ‚ÄúOne can‚Äôt order a toasted sandwich without the other signing off on that,‚Äù Rory says. So in practical terms, it should not make any difference to the running of Northern Ireland. But one part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement could derail that altogether. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? As the EU has border checks when certain goods, particularly food, arrive from non-EU countries, when the UK voted to leave there was a major problem ‚Äì what happens between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland? Putting a border in place would threaten the Good Friday Agreement, something both sides have stressed their commitment to protecting. And so the Northern Ireland protocol was born ‚Äì instead of border checks happening between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, they were to happen between Northern Ireland and Great Britain instead. It was an imperfect solution to an impossible problem, but the protocol was enshrined in international law. Rory wrote a great explainer on what it is, why it matters and what it will mean for the future of Northern Ireland. What does this mean for Northern Ireland? The Democratic Unionist party has two main problems with the Northern Ireland protocol, Rory tells me: it‚Äôs hurting Northern Ireland‚Äôs economy and it undermines its position in the UK, by creating a de facto border between Northern Ireland and Britain. And so, in response, the DUP has said that it will block the formation of a power-sharing administration unless Downing Street radically changes the protocol. If this were to happen, it would send Northern Ireland into a political crisis, creating what Rory has described as a ‚Äúzombified form of local government‚Äù. Some ministers from the outgoing executive would stay on ‚Äì but with much reduced responsibilities and powers. ‚ÄúThey kind of keep the lights on, just about, but they cannot make any major decisions or launch new initiatives.‚Äù Northern Ireland is pretty familiar with this set up: in 2017 Sinn F√©in blocked power sharing over a dispute with the DUP and Stormont was suspended for three years. In January, it was the DUP‚Äôs turn to press the stop button and suspend the executive. This means constraints on spending because there‚Äôs nobody to sign crucial budgetary decisions. A government that can barely function means that the public are left in the lurch: ‚ÄúNorthern Ireland‚Äôs got a serious health care crisis,‚Äù Rory says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs got some of the worst waiting lists and health metrics in the UK. There‚Äôs a consensus in Northern Ireland that healthcare is a disaster and needs urgent attention.‚Äù So when rumblings of another government shutdown surfaced, health care professionals started to panic. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a joint statement from five medical organisations, including the British Medical Association Northern Ireland and the Royal College of GPs, where they are pleading with politicians in Northern Ireland to form an executive because if they don‚Äôt, they say, it will compound the crisis in healthcare and will risk the lives of patients.‚Äù Rory tells me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how high the stakes are.‚Äù It‚Äôs a dilemma: on the one hand, a stable government in Northern Ireland depends on some revision to the Northern Ireland protocol. But on the other, threatening to withdraw unilaterally risks the economy for the entirety of the UK. And in the midst of all this political noise, one thing is clear: the people on the sharp end of this political paralysis are the public.

5/13/2022,"A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, while the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. In a watershed moment, a Russian soldier will be accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian when he appears in the dock on Friday, with the case coming as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine‚Äôs general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv‚Äôs district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered ‚Äúto kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders‚Äù, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened ‚Äúdozens of metres‚Äù from the victim‚Äôs house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The case was this week filed at a criminal court. ‚ÄúHe is here [in Ukraine], we have him,‚Äù said Ukraine‚Äôs prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the prosecutor‚Äôs office said: ‚ÄúProsecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.‚Äù Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while ‚Äúthreatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons‚Äù. The trial is another prpaganda triumph for Kyiv and another diplomatic move increasing pressure on Vladimir Putin with Finland‚Äôs plan to apply for Nato membership, and the expectation that Sweden will follow. Moscow called Finland‚Äôs announcement hostile and threatened retaliation, including unspecified ‚Äúmilitary-technical‚Äù measures. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the Finns would be ‚Äúwarmly welcomed‚Äù and promised a ‚Äúsmooth and swift‚Äù accession process. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: ‚ÄúWe would support a Nato application by Finland and-or Sweden should they apply.‚Äù Britain‚Äôs foreign secretary, Liz Truss has urged a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to equip Ukraine to Nato standards and maintain sanctions against Russia until it has fully withdrawn. The BBC reported that Truss told the meeting in Germany: ‚Äú[Vladimir] Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression. ‚ÄúThe best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment.‚Äù Elsewhere, Ukraine has claimed that it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea, as the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. ‚ÄúThanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire ‚Äì it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,‚Äù said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine‚Äôs sea border with Romania. Maxar images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island. Russia‚Äôs defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine‚Äôs north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, around 40km (25 miles) east of Kharkiv. Regional authorities reported ongoing missile strikes around Poltava and shelling at Dergach, near Kharkiv, that killed two people. Russia‚Äôs army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. Fighting has continued in Ukraine‚Äôs south and east. Ukraine‚Äôs presidency said shelling continued throughout Lugansk ‚Äì part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Zelensky said in his Thursday address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 health care facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. ‚ÄúWhat for? It‚Äôs nonsense. It‚Äôs barbarity.‚Äù In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said.

5/13/2022,"Tony Blair has urged Keir Starmer to reject ‚Äúwoke‚Äù politics and present a programme for government that is ‚Äúradical without being dangerous‚Äù. A report published by the Tony Blair Institute analyses the impact of class on voting in the 2019 general election and beyond. Based on analysis by the veteran pollster Peter Kellner, it points to particular problems for Labour with two groups: the 26% of voters who fit into the formal definition of middle class; and the 12% who would be defined as working class by pollsters but consider themselves middle class. The first group voted 57% to remain in the EU, yet the Conservatives were 22% ahead with these voters in 2019, despite their central message being that they would ‚Äúget Brexit done‚Äù. These voters, the former Labour leader suggests, are ‚Äúworried about issues like tax and economic competence‚Äù. The second group, whom Blair calls the ‚Äúaspirational working class‚Äù, voted to leave the EU by a narrower 53% but backed the Conservatives over Labour by a 32% margin. In a punchy foreword, Blair claims of this latter group: ‚ÄúA large number voted Conservative despite disagreeing with the party on Brexit. They thought Labour‚Äôs far-left economic policy was a bigger threat than Brexit.‚Äù Without what he calls the ‚Äúmillstone‚Äù of Starmer‚Äôs predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Blair claims Labour can win many of these voters back ‚Äì and analysis of recent polling in the report shows a 12% swing to Labour among this ‚Äúblue-collar aspirational‚Äù group. The former prime minister suggests they are social conservatives, and thus urges Labour to ensure it is on the centre ground on ‚Äúculture war‚Äù issues such as transgender rights. Blair says the party should ‚Äúplant Labour‚Äôs feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people, who want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the ‚Äòcancel culture‚Äô, ‚Äòwoke‚Äô mentality.‚Äù Labour has sometimes appeared to struggle with culture war issues. For example, Starmer and the party chair, Anneliese Dodds, were criticised recently for being unable to give a straightforward answer to the question: what is a woman? A clearer frontbench line has since been agreed, resulting in the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, telling an interviewer: ‚ÄúMen have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson.‚Äù The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden has sought to capitalise on the party‚Äôs discomfort, accusing Starmer in a recent speech of ‚Äúkowtowing to the cancel culture brigade‚Äù and claiming: ‚ÄúThe Corbynistas, they are still there.‚Äù Starmer has been accused by some on the left of Labour of winning the leadership under false pretences by espousing key tenets of Corbynism during the campaign in 2020 and then moving towards the centre ground. Blair also calls on Labour to work on rebuilding its economic credibility, as he says the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already begun to do. ‚ÄúLabour must cure both its cultural and its economic aspiration problems. It must do the first to regain those voters who went Tory despite being traditional blue collar. These are the northern ‚Äòred wallers‚Äô. But Labour must also do the second to have any realistic chance of winning,‚Äù he says. He also warns Starmer against excessive caution ‚Äì something the Labour leader is charged with by some colleagues. ‚ÄúThe bane of progressive politics is to think the choice is between being voter-friendly and boring, or exciting and voter-repellent,‚Äù he says. As an example of the kind of radical policy he would like to see, Blair suggests tackling concerns about illegal immigration by introducing biometric ID as a precondition for accessing work and public services.",News/Politics,Tony Blair tells Starmer to drop ‚Äòwoke‚Äô politics and focus on economy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/tony-blair-tells-keir-starmer-to-drop-woke-politics-and-focus-on-economy-labour

5/13/2022,"Extra supplies of hormone replacement therapy products could be shipped to the UK from France and Poland as soon as next week, a major manufacturer has said after crisis meetings were held to address the nationwide shortage. Tina Backhouse, the general UK manager at Theramex, which makes about a dozen HRT drugs, including Bijuva pills and Femseven patches, said the company needed special permission to bring in products from France that were not licensed in the UK. Theramex‚Äôs products are mainly made in Germany, and some are only licensed in other European countries. Backhouse met the UK‚Äôs newly appointed HRT tsar, Madelaine McTernan, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency this week and expects to obtain consent after a further meeting with the agency on Monday. ‚ÄúWe are working with MHRA to get special permission. It‚Äôs not an unusual thing, other companies do it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it will be long, we‚Äôve got it [the stock] ready.‚Äù Theramex, a private equity-owned pharmaceutical firm based in London, is also preparing to bring in HRT patches from Poland, which are licensed in the UK but need English labels. ‚ÄúWe are looking for short-term solutions as well as longer-term solutions in terms of bringing other products from other countries in,‚Äù Backhouse said. The UK appears to be the only country with a shortage of HRT products. It was triggered by a surge in demand after the TV presenters Davina McCall and Mariella Frostrup spoke about their menopause experiences. Besins Healthcare, a privately owned firm based in Brussels which makes the most popular oestrogen gel product, said on Thursday that it was ‚Äúlooking at all options for increasing short-term supplies of Oestrogel into the UK‚Äù. The British Menopause Society and HRT manufacturers are calling for other measures, including a national list or ‚Äúformulary‚Äù of approved HRT medicines that would allow all doctors and pharmacists to prescribe whichever products are available. When local clinical commissioning groups were created in England in 2013, many previously national-level decision making and budgetary powers passed to them. This means there can be delays in certain areas of the country when new drugs are licensed. Backhouse said: ‚ÄúWe have brand new products in this country that are licensed but aren‚Äôt being used because of formulary restrictions. At this stage surely we should have a national formulary of HRTs that are available and in stock, rather than waiting for every individual locality to do that. It would be so easy to do.‚Äù She said Theramex had a new MHRA-approved product that was only being prescribed in three areas, or used privately by women paying for it themselves.

5/13/2022,"Boris Johnson‚Äôs Queen‚Äôs speech was largely empty of substance. So thank goodness for the housing and planning secretary, Michael Gove. In his contribution he never spoke truer words, at least if anyone understood them. He has dismissed housing targets as ‚ÄúProcrustean ‚Ä¶ arbitrary ‚Ä¶ perfect arithmetic‚Äù. In plain terms, what Gove meant was that Johnson‚Äôs mantra of ‚Äúbuild, build, build‚Äù (a parroting of his chief party donors, the construction lobby) was senseless. The build-or-be-damned policies of David Cameron and George Osborne had funnelled jobs, people and money into the south-east of England, spawning characterless housing estates from Hampshire to East Anglia. This had enraged Tory voters in villages and small towns, because it sucked the life out of existing communities, crushing high streets and closing local pubs. The response at last week‚Äôs local elections was clear: stop the policy. The British housing sector is not ‚Äúin crisis‚Äù. Sectors such as social housing are in trouble and need far more help. But property prices have been rising fast, up 11% from last year. They have risen in all rich countries, driven largely by decades of low interest rates. Gove is right to protest at the fatuous government statistic that Britain ‚Äúneeds‚Äù 300,000 houses a year, broken down to individual counties and cities. There is no Leninist requirement of a roof, bedroom and sitting room for each Briton, allocated by the state from birth to death. Whitehall‚Äôs centralism can be plain barmy. A housing market responds to changing patterns of migration and demand. Most people would like a different, preferably a better, house. Whether they can realise that preference depends on myriad factors, chiefly price. British housing ‚Äì overwhelmingly in houses rather than the European preference for flats ‚Äì is desperately inefficient. As the geographer Danny Dorling has noted, a third of British bedrooms are empty on any given night and even London has a bedroom surplus. Britons have 2.5 rooms each. As for new building, it has virtually no impact on price, since some 90% of house sales are of existing properties. Countries that build extravagantly, such as the US and Australia, have house prices soaring faster than Britain. As Dorling has pointed out, social and demographic differences hold the key to housing supply. The gap between London and the rest of the United Kingdom yawns wider than anywhere in Europe. First-time buyers in Westminster pay an average of ¬£906,000 for a property, while in North Ayrshire they pay ¬£102,000. Yet it is London not Scotland that holds a magnetic hold on young people. Despite the high prices, it still has the youngest population ‚Äì its median age, of 35, is six years younger than Scotland ‚Äì and the youngest workforce in Britain. A London street or tube concourse teems with youthful faces. Their living conditions may be cramped, but the Dick Whittington effect is as strong as ever. If Gove really wants to bring down house prices, he should increase market flexibility. The most absurd tax in Britain is stamp duty, a tax on house transfer. Sales soared when the duty was suspended early in the pandemic, and have now slumped. Britons are reckless users of property. Stamp duty penalises downsizing and rewards housing waste. It is mad. The abolition of the tax would free up existing property, allowing retired people to swap places with young families. Higher council tax or a mansion tax would make more sense. The biggest challenge for Gove is the other half of his brief. It lies in what he sees as the true nature of ‚Äúlevelling up‚Äù. Every prime minister since Margaret Thatcher has wanted to bless the north ‚Äì or its voters ‚Äì rather as the Victorians wanted to help the poor. Yet they all pumped infrastructure and housing subsidy into London, ever widening the gulf. Johnson often says levelling up does not mean ‚Äúlevelling down‚Äù. But he continues to tip vanity public spending into London, its railways, airports, bridges, sewers and even, it seems, the buildings of parliament. The reality is that if the north really is to be more attractive as a place to live and work than the south-east, then the south-east must be made less so. This means putting a stop to first-time house-buyer subsidies for Londoners, which anyway just increase prices. For those on lower incomes, house prices would drop over time. It means, as previously mentioned, giving rich councils powers to set higher council tax bands to sting their wealthier residents, motivating them to downsize. It means making London less attractive to foreign property ownership and enforcing the subletting of vacant properties. The stark residential emptiness of the West End is so brazen it must explain the Tories‚Äô loss of Westminster council this month. Levelling up should mean not building over ever wider expanses of the south-east‚Äôs countryside to welcome northern migrants. It should mean increasing ‚Äì and publicising ‚Äì the competing attractions of the north‚Äôs countryside. What has appealed to London‚Äôs creativity has been the vitality of its Victorian market hubs and restored commercial architecture. The north has these in plenty and should exploit them. It should fight to keep its young skills, perhaps waiving student debts if graduates stay working five years in the north. House prices are not a random variable. They reflect where people prefer to live. Britain‚Äôs poorer regions need policies to help them retain their talent, creativity and prosperity.

5/13/2022,"With high temperatures and high pollen levels forecast this weekend, millions of people with lung conditions or hay fever in the UK are being urged to take precautions. The Met Office is predicting high pollen levels across every area of England and Wales on Friday and Saturday, with medium levels in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. The charity Asthma and Lung UK said more than 3 million people in the UK have lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are at risk of attacks or flare-ups this weekend. People are being urged to ensure they keep on taking preventer inhalers if they use them and to keep their reliever inhaler with them at all times. Other tips include staying indoors on high-pollen days and keeping an eye on weather forecasts. Pollen can trigger symptoms such as a tight chest, wheezing and breathlessness in more than half of people living with asthma (59%) and more than a quarter of those living with COPD, according to research from the charity. Allergies can cause airways to tighten up and a build-up of sticky mucus, making it harder to breathe. Asthma attacks can be fatal, with about four people in the UK dying from one every day. ‚ÄúWhen pollen levels are at their highest this can be deadly for those with lung conditions like asthma who can suffer serious symptoms and have life-threatening attacks,‚Äù said Dr Andy Whittamore, the clinical lead for Asthma and Lung UK. ‚ÄúThese attacks can leave people fighting for breath, which can be terrifying, but there are things they can do to look after themselves. ‚ÄúUsing your preventer inhalers as prescribed is important as the medicine reduces sensitivity and swelling in the airways, helping to prevent symptoms such as wheezing and coughing before they even start. ‚ÄúWe also advise people to carry their reliever inhalers every day, especially when they are out and about enjoying the sunshine in case pollen does cause a flare-up of their symptoms. Reliever inhalers quickly relax the muscles in the airways and ease symptoms immediately. ‚ÄúThe third thing people can do is to use a steroid nasal spray every day, together with non-drowsy antihistamine tablets to help stop the allergic reaction. People should also check pollen and air pollution forecasts in their local area, so they can avoid going outdoors as much as possible on high pollen days.‚Äù The high pollen levels expected this weekend may also affect millions of people who suffer from hay fever. The condition is usually worse when it‚Äôs warm, humid and windy. With high levels predicted this weekend, people may be more likely to experience symptoms including sneezing and coughing, a runny or blocked nose, itchy, red or watery eyes, itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears, loss of smell, pain around your temples and forehead, headache, earache and fatigue. Hay fever can last for weeks or months, unlike a cold, which usually goes away after one or two weeks. There is currently no cure for hay fever and people who experience it cannot prevent it. However, the NHS says there are things people can do to ease their symptoms when the pollen count is high across England and Wales on Friday and Saturday. They include putting Vaseline around the nostrils to trap pollen, wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into the eyes, and showering and changing clothes after being outside to wash pollen off. Other tips include staying indoors whenever possible, keeping windows and doors shut as much as possible, vacuuming regularly and dusting with a damp cloth. Pharmacists can give advice and suggest the best treatments, such as antihistamine drops, tablets or nasal sprays to help with itchy and watery eyes, sneezing, and a blocked nose. Pollen levels are forecast to remain high in England and Wales across the weekend, but are set to fall to medium in north-east England on Sunday and drop to medium in London and the south-east by Monday.",News/Society,Pollen levels prompt warning to UK asthma and hay fever sufferers,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/pollen-levels-uk-met-office-warning-asthma-hay-fever-copd
5/13/2022,"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, said Freud. But darlings, let me tell you ‚Äì a snake is never just a snake. And certainly not in The Essex Serpent (Apple TV+), the new six part miniseries adapted by Anna Symon from Sarah Perry‚Äôs 2016 bestselling novel of the same name. At the tail end of the Victorian era and recently liberated by her wealthy, abusive husband‚Äôs death from cancer, young widow Cora Seaborne (Claire Danes) abandons London society and moves to Aldwinter on the edge of the Blackwater marshes to pursue a much more fulfilling life as an amateur paleontologist in comfortable clothes. With her she takes her devoted maidservant Martha (Hayley Squires) and her autistic (in modern day terms) son Frankie. Her husband‚Äôs former doctor, Luke Garrett (Frank Dillane), becomes a friend ‚Äì and, in time, a contender at least in his eyes for her affections ‚Äì and visits often. When sightings of the legendary monster of the marshes begin, Cora theorises that it may be a living fossil ‚Äì an icthyosaur-like being that escaped evolutionary pressures in the ancient wetlands ‚Äì while the locals cleave to superstition and supernatural explanations for what they call ‚Äúthe Blackwater Beast‚Äù. Between the two stands the Rev Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston), a man of God but also of the Enlightenment, keen to keep the growing fears and fancies of his flock under control and not call on divine or diabolic explanation unless all others have been exhausted. In this, he is not helped by his curate Matthew, a fire and brimstone type (whose name is surely meant to evoke the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, who began his career in Essex in the 17th century) who sees the serpent as a sign from God that urgent repentance of the villagers‚Äô sins is needed. As the friendship between Will, his ailing wife Stella (Cl√©mence Poesy) and Cora grows, so does the attraction between Will and Cora ‚Äì rather less convincingly on screen than in the book. Perhaps this is down to a lack of chemistry between the leads, or perhaps the miscasting of Hiddleston, who never manages to shed his innate air of suave confidence. It works well when playing a god of mischief amidst a plethora of equally towering egos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; less so when playing a Victorian vicar humble enough to admit doubts and wrestle with his conscience. Let alone fall in love with a woman cleverer than him, and spend time offering explanations that he is too honest to dismiss out of hand, however much they pain him. It gives his exchanges with Cora a condescending edge that is the death knell to the love and profound yearning that animated their relationship in the novel. Danes, on the other hand, is magnificent as Cora ‚Äì brusque, athletic, undisguisably intelligent and every inch a woman gradually being restored to life and self in the wake of her husband‚Äôs brutality. In fact, all the women are wonderful, from Squires, who brings vitality and conviction to what could be the slightly worthy part of the Socialist servant eager to bring about change, via Lily-Rose Aslandogdu and Dixie Egerickx as guilt-stricken youngsters who fear they summoned the beast, to Poesy who ‚Äì as gentle, watchful Stella, is a heartbroken and heartbreaking revelation. For all that, there is something strangely cold and sluggish about the adaptation of Perry‚Äôs book, which despite being a novel of ideas, was lush and vibrant, too. Although it excavated the links between myth, science and religion, it held up love in all its forms to the light as well. Platonic love, sexual love, requited and unrequited romantic love, love of a child, of a vocation, of discovery, of God. It was Wuthering Heights pulled into shape and given intellectual rigour without losing any of its sweeping gothic passion. But on screen, abundance has become austerity, suppressed feeling shades into inertia and the protagonists keep treading and retreading the same small patch of argumentative ground instead of sparking off each other and forging the greater and greater bond on which the story should turn. Maybe I am simply too much a fan of the book. Symon‚Äôs take works perfectly well as a drama that delivers suitably sinuous twists and, under Clio Barnard‚Äôs direction, looks grimly fabulous, emerging out of the marsh mists that seem to promise that any malevolence is possible. And Danes grounds and gives a remarkable truth to the whole. But even allowing for the fact that screen adaptations rarely capture the full filigree of a literary novelist‚Äôs work (one reason why uncomplicated genre fiction generally fares better ‚Äì there is more to add, less to lose), it feels like slightly too much has been lost in translation here.",Arts/Television & radio,The Essex Serpent review ‚Äì Claire Danes is magnificent ‚Ä¶ unlike Tom Hiddleston,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/13/the-essex-serpent-review-claire-danes-is-magnificent-unlike-tom-hiddleston
5/13/2022,"A woman who accuses Ben Roberts-Smith of punching her in the face during a late-night argument in a Canberra hotel sustained a large haematoma on her head falling down the stairs at Parliament House earlier in the night, a federal court defamation trial has heard. The woman, with whom Roberts-Smith was having an affair during 2017 and 2018, has previously given evidence a black eye she sustained that night was the result of Roberts-Smith punching her, knocking her backwards on to a bed. Roberts-Smith maintains the injury was sustained when she fell down a flight of stairs earlier in the evening, and said the assault allegation was a ‚Äúfabrication‚Äù. The woman ‚Äì whose identity has been protected by the court with the pseudonym Person 17 ‚Äì does not contest she fell down the stairs, but told the court in her evidence given in March she was also punched by Roberts-Smith later that night. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia‚Äôs most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ¬≠reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as an act of domestic violence against Person 17. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Called by Roberts-Smith to give evidence in the federal court Friday, a defence industry executive, Terry Nichols, testified he met Person 17 at the end of a function at Parliament House in early 2018. Nichols, a former army officer, said the woman was unsteady on her feet and slurred her speech as she asked him if he knew Ben Roberts-Smith. Nichols said he told Person 17 while he did not know Roberts-Smith, he had recognised him at the event, and would find him. As he was calling a lift to take Person 17 to the car park she attempted to descend a flight of stairs unaided and fell face first, striking her head on the landing, Nichols told the court. He said the fall made a ‚Äúterrible thud‚Äù and Person 17 was momentarily unconscious. When she came round, Nichols said, ‚Äúthere was a very large haematoma on the left side of her forehead above her eye ‚Ä¶ an immediate consequence of the fall‚Äù. Nichols asked two Australian federal police officers, who were nearby, to arrange for an ambulance for her, because of the size of the haematoma: ‚ÄúIt was like a large egg, quite a substantial lump above the left eyebrow ‚Ä¶ given it had happened so quickly, that‚Äôs why it was of concern.‚Äù Nichols said Person 17 assured him she was not seriously injured: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK, I‚Äôm OK, I just need to see Ben,‚Äù Nichols testified she said. Nichols said he left Person 17 with the AFP officers and went to find Roberts-Smith in the car park. He found Roberts-Smith and directed him back to Person 17. He did not see either of them again. In her evidence to the court, Person 17 said: ‚ÄúI fell down about ‚Ä¶ two or three steps on to the landing and I hit my head as I fell.‚Äù The evidence about the stairs is relevant to Roberts-Smith‚Äôs defamation case because it relates to one of the key allegations made against him: by the newspapers as part of their truth defence: that person 17 was assaulted in the hotel room she shared with Roberts-Smith. Subpoenaed by the newspapers to give evidence in March this year, Person 17 said Roberts-Smith was angry with her back at their hotel room, yelling in her face, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck have you done‚Äù, saying she had been flirtatious with other men, and had exposed their affair. Person 17 said she just wanted to go to bed and that her head hurt. She told the court Roberts-Smith responded by saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to hurt more‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you hurt‚Äù. ‚ÄúAnd he punched me with his right fist on the side of my face and left eye ‚Ä¶ I ended up lying on the bed. I just lay there still because I didn‚Äôt know what he was going to do next.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said ‚Äòmy head hurts and I want to go to the hospital‚Äô. ‚ÄúHe said ‚Äòno, you‚Äôll be fine, I‚Äôll look after you‚Äô.‚Äù Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith was questioned on the alleged incident at the Canberra hotel during his testimony before the court last year. He denied all allegations of violence or threatening behaviour, saying the allegations were ‚Äúcompletely false‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe whole story is a fabrication,‚Äù he told the court. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never hit a woman. I never would hit a woman. And I certainly never hit Person 17.‚Äù Roberts-Smith said Person 17 sustained the injuries to her face and side when she fell down the stairs at Parliament House. He said he did not believe she needed to go to hospital, and he took her to the hotel room where he undressed her, put an icepack on her head, and put her to bed. Ben Roberts-Smith‚Äôs former wife, Emma Roberts, has previously told the court Person 17 had a black eye several days later when she arrived unannounced at her family home to reveal the affair. Roberts told the court Person 17 told her she had fallen down some stairs at Parliament House. In her evidence, Person 17 said she lied about the cause of the black eye because she feared retribution from Ben Roberts-Smith. ‚ÄúI knew that I would be targeted by him,‚Äù she said. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court he and his wife were separated at the time he and Person 17 began their affair. His now ex-wife told the court this was not true, that they were not separated.

5/13/2022,"A review that criticised the format of Channel Nine‚Äôs leaders‚Äô debate was spiked by Tory Maguire, the executive editor of Nine Entertainment‚Äôs newspapers the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Maguire has editorial control of the national content in the two mastheads, and she has confirmed she spiked the piece by senior culture writer Karl Quinn, but not for the reasons some staff feared. ‚ÄúThe original brief for Karl‚Äôs piece, about how the shoutyness of the debate might alienate young viewers, ended up being very similar to a separately commissioned piece by Jess Irvine,‚Äù Maguire told Weekly Beast. ‚ÄúWe ended up with too many takes on one topic, which is something we try to avoid. We also covered commentary on the tone of the debate in our news coverage. Spiking stories is not that unusual, especially on a fast-moving news day when there are lots of people commissioning.‚Äù While Irvine‚Äôs article did mention the debate‚Äôs ‚Äúgenerally ill-tempered tone‚Äù, it was largely an analysis of what was said from an economic perspective. After all, Irvine is an economics correspondent. Quinn‚Äôs review tackled the debate as a piece of television, arguing it failed on several fronts as the men talked over each other. Sources say he filed it around midday on Monday and it never appeared. The two venerable newspapers, whose motto is ‚Äúindependent always‚Äù, teamed up with Nine News, 60 Minutes and 2GB for Sunday night‚Äôs television spectacle in what was a very public display of a sometimes uneasy media alliance formed in 2018, when Fairfax merged with Nine. ‚ÄúFor all the post-event pearl clutching from some commentators who disliked Sunday night‚Äôs heat-and-fury leaders‚Äô debate, Channel Nine‚Äôs viewers seemed to find it compelling enough to stay the course.‚Äù https://t.co/Z2BVLkXOH6 ‚ÄúThis was the first time ever we have combined the power of Nine as the biggest media group in the country with the experience of Nine‚Äôs journalists across our broadcast television, publishing, radio and digital platforms for this 60 Minutes special event,‚Äù Nine‚Äôs news director Darren Wick told staff on Monday. ‚ÄúSarah Abo, from 60 Minutes, Chris Uhlmann from Nine News, Deborah Knight representing Nine Radio (3AW; 4BC, 2GB, 6PR) and David Crowe, from The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald made a formidable combination.‚Äù ‚ÄòThe complaint about the paltry ‚Äú60-second slivers‚Äù featured in what ranks as the performance art piece of outrage thundered at Nine‚Äôs debate by The Guardian.‚Äô https://t.co/0P8lD1aKiZ Among the many critical voices was Nine‚Äôs own 2GB broadcaster Ben Fordham: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt great. It was a shambles. It was messy, disjointed, awkward. All over the shop.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt go as far as the Guardian‚Äôs Katharine Murphy, who was critical of the format, not the host, and wrote on Sunday night: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to find words for how terrible that second leaders‚Äô debate was. A genuine shit blizzard. It was the Jerry Springer of leaders‚Äô debates.‚Äù Nine's Great Debate audience peaked at 1.178 million and averaged 904,000. Another 70,000 on 9Now.

That does not include SMH and Age streaming or audiences on 3AW, 4BC, 2GB and 6PR While Quinn‚Äôs take never appeared, the SMH and the Age did publish an extraordinary piece by Nine‚Äôs political editor Chris Uhlmann the next day. Uhlmann was one on a panel of three questioners with David Crowe and Deborah Knight for the debate, which may explain this swipe at Guardian Australia: ‚ÄúIt is odd that an organ [Guardian Australia] so angrily post-Christian behaves so much like the medieval church, because it has appointed itself the guardian of the constantly shifting sands of modern virtue, and routinely conducts witch-hunts,‚Äù Uhlmann wrote. ‚ÄúIt is also so disconnected from Australia‚Äôs sources of wealth, food and power that it spends most of its time campaigning to shut them down.‚Äù It‚Äôs good to know the cartoonists are still free to express their views at the SMH and Age. Trying to follow the leaders pic.twitter.com/qnFzHjKsWW After all the criticism of Nine‚Äôs debate, Seven had a roadmap for what not to do. Seven political editor Mark Riley stood close to the two leaders and kept a tight rein on them, resulting in a respectful and sober affair. The debate‚Äôs numbers were slightly below Nine‚Äôs, which is not surprising given the later time slot and a very poor lead-in from Big Brother, but Seven and Riley were widely praised for their efforts by gallery veterans Barrie Cassidy, Laura Tingle, David Speers and Paul Bongiorno. On the back of her views about trans women in sport, the Liberal party‚Äôs Warringah candidate Katherine Deves has become a major player in the media‚Äôs coverage of the election campaign. Deves is the eighth-most mentioned candidate, according to media monitoring, ahead of Labor frontbenchers Penny Wong and Jason Clare and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, and that is despite refusing most media requests for interviews. Deves did appear on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday after sitting down with normally London-based reporter Latika Bourke for a chat, in which she ‚Äúrepeatedly burst into tears‚Äù and spoke of ‚Äúdark moments‚Äù.

I would say to those other candidates they‚Äôre not reading the room.""My interview with this election's most controversial candidate, Katherine Deves:https://t.co/WOKRLQJJkp The Age ran the story not on page one but inside, over two pages, under the headline ‚ÄúTears and ‚Äòdark moments‚Äô but Deves fights on‚Äù. The Liberal candidate spelled out all the pain she has suffered since her divisive tweets were uncovered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really debased the electoral process ‚Äî people should be able to speak their minds and engage and put their hands up for public office without their safety or their children‚Äôs safety put at risk,‚Äù Deves told the SMH. Among the criticism of Bourke‚Äôs piece is that Deves does not identify what polling she is relying on to back up her claim that the majority of Australians agree with her position on trans women in sport. ‚ÄúI would highly doubt‚Äù https://t.co/102m0twaa9 In the same newspaper a day earlier, political commentator Niki Savva said senior Liberals accused Morrison of ‚Äúabandoning progressive Liberals and using Deves to chase conservative Christians or people of other faiths‚Äù. The Nine papers may have helped that cause, giving Deves such sympathetic exposure a week before the polls. The Sydney Morning Herald declined to comment when approached about the story. Not long after we published our piece about Sky News presenter Paul Murray unleashing a foul-mouthed tirade against Labor at Eatons Hill Hotel in Brisbane, Murray‚Äôs 8pm show came on Sky News on Thursday evening. While Murray did not dignify us with a mention, his regular Labor party guest Nicholas Reece did. Reece, the deputy lord mayor of Melbourne city council, was aware of what Murray had said about him on Tuesday night in the leaked audio but he was happy to roll with the punches. In the audio, after Murray‚Äôs audience said they didn‚Äôt like the Labor guests Reece or Stephen Conroy, Murray laughed and said Reece was like a ‚Äúblow-up clown doll‚Äù, meaning he gets knocked down and always comes back for more, adding: ‚ÄúHe thinks he‚Äôs doing God‚Äôs work‚Äù. After saying hello to Murray on Thursday‚Äôs program, Reece smiled and said he was happy to be on the show ‚Äúdoing God‚Äôs work‚Äù. Murray did not bite. The Liberal party has not responded to multiple attempts by Crikey journalists to secure an invitation to its campaign launch in Brisbane on Sunday. The managing editor of Crikey‚Äôs owner Private Media, Peter Fray, is unimpressed by the cold shoulder.

5/13/2022,"A Senate committee has called for a royal commission into the robodebt scandal, accusing the government and its departments of the ‚Äúdeliberate withholding‚Äù of information about the botched scheme. The Labor-Greens majority committee, chaired by the Greens‚Äô Janet Rice, found the Centrelink debt recovery program it said was announced by Scott Morrison in 2015 had ‚Äúindiscriminately targeted some of Australia‚Äôs most vulnerable people‚Äù. ‚ÄúIt caused significant and widespread harm to their psychological and financial wellbeing,‚Äù the inquiry report said, adding that at least two suicides had occurred among people caught up in what is officially known as the income compliance program. The call was rejected by Coalition senators on the committee who claim a royal commission would ‚Äúonly promote anxiety and undermine trust in Government services‚Äù. In March 2020, Guardian Australia broke the news that the government had privately conceded the mammoth, years-long welfare crackdown was unlawful and it would need to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars. Two months later the government publicly announced the backdown, before settling in court a year later for $1.8bn, which included the owed interest on the debts unlawfully issued to 443,000 people. The move came only after court challenges were filed by Victoria Legal Aid and then Gordon Legal in a class action created with the support of Labor‚Äôs Bill Shorten that was mocked by the government at the time. Welfare recipients, advocates and grassroots campaigners, such as the NotMyDebt group, raised the alarm about the scheme as early as 2016. Despite the settlement, those groups, as well as Labor, the Greens and other crossbenchers have long maintained there has been no transparency about how the scheme came to be developed, nor what the government knew about its legality. No ministers or public servants lost their job after the scandal. Rice, who took over from Greens‚Äô Rachel Siewert as the chair of the committee, said the report showed how ‚Äúdevastating the robodebt scheme was for hundreds of thousands of people‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis tremendous hurt and trauma could have been avoided,‚Äù she said in a statement. Some victims reported experiencing depression and anxiety as they dealt with the stress of suddenly owing the government thousands of dollars in debts later found to be unlawful, with some pursued incessantly by private debt collectors until they paid up or having had their tax returns garnisheed without warning. One victim, Nathan Kearney, told Guardian Australia he moved back with his parents to country Victoria and worked 50 hours a week in a job he didn‚Äôt like to repay $6,500. Rice claimed Morrison was the ‚Äúarchitect of this horrific program‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe drew up the blueprints when he was the Minister for Social Services, oversaw its expansion as the treasurer and continued it as prime minister until the courts found it unlawful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúScott Morrison and his ministers still haven‚Äôt explained when they first learned robodebt was illegal, and why they continued until the courts stopped them, despite the clear evidence of the harm they were inflicting.‚Äù Morrison has never explained his role in the creation of the scheme, but apologised on behalf of the government for ‚Äúany hurt or harm‚Äù caused by the scheme in comments to parliament in June 2020. Asked about a Labor promise for a royal commission re-announced during the campaign, Morrison said last month he believed the matter had already been ‚Äúaddressed‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere have been numerous inquiries into this and there‚Äôs been court matters which we‚Äôve fully cooperated in, and almost $750m in response to that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the changes in the scheme have been in place.‚Äù But the Senate committee said its attempts to enquire into the scheme‚Äôs origins and development had been blocked by Morrison government. ‚ÄúThe committee met with entrenched resistance and opacity to its request for information from government ministers and departments, severely hindering its ability to produce this report for the Senate,‚Äù it said. The committee said it had requested documents including briefings provided to the government during the scheme‚Äôs operation, any legal advice, the legal costs attributed to the program and a February 2015 executive minute to the then social services minister, Scott Morrison, that proposed a ‚Äúnew online approach to compliance‚Äù. The government has blocked those requests, saying the documents were cabinet-in-confidence or subject to legal professional privilege and that their release would be contrary to the public interest. In a dissenting report, Coalition senators Wendy Askew and Hollie Hughes said there was no need for an royal commission because the issue had ‚Äúsubject to extensive scrutiny including from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, through parliamentary inquiries and has also been subject to decisions of the federal court‚Äù. They also claimed ‚Äúanother review on the Income Compliance Program will only promote anxiety and undermine trust in government services on the basis of issues that have been acknowledged and comprehensively addressed‚Äù. ‚ÄúTo date, over 99% of refunds have been made and approximately 429,000 people have received a refund or had their debts reduced to zero,‚Äù they said. Those on Centrelink payments are required to report their income on a fortnightly basis so their benefits are paid at the correct rate. The robodebt scheme sent debt letters to past and present welfare recipients, mostly students and jobseekers, accusing them of underreporting their income. It used a process known as ‚Äúincome averaging‚Äù, which used annual tax office data to estimate a person‚Äôs fortnightly income. While the calculations were often wildly inaccurate, victims were then required to provide old payslips or bank statements dating back up to seven years to demonstrate they had not been overpaid. The government is said to have ignored at least 76 administrative appeals tribunal decisions questioning the scheme‚Äôs legality, starting in January 2017.

Next, from the oaks behind me, a willow warbler takes the stage, then a stonechat and a wren, both just below me, close to the broad track that runs along the valley. Yet it feels as if I‚Äôm waiting for something greater, for the star of the show. And with a shrill call, she‚Äôs there: a ring ouzel perched on a large rock fringed with bilberry. Ring ouzels are Burbage‚Äôs celebrities, a success story for this species against a picture of national decline. Almost half of Britain‚Äôs breeding pairs have disappeared in the last four decades. Their triumph here is partly down to a concentrated conservation effort from ring ouzel fans, who first came, like me, for the climbing or biking, but now monitor these dapper migrants as they return each spring from their winters in Morocco. Known also as mountain blackbirds, ring ouzels wear a blaze of white on their chests and feathers elsewhere are fringed with white, giving a subtle, scalloped effect. They also have a strut about them. The female I‚Äôm watching hops down from her perch to work a patch of dead bracken stalks with her bill, straightening often to take a view. And how very straight she stands, in contrast to the dumpy blackbird, an elegant performer on the mountain stage.

5/13/2022,"The elusive education minister, Alan Tudge, has emerged on WeChat in an interview with a Chinese community leader where he responds generally to questions which include what to do about ‚Äútoxic gender ideology‚Äù infiltrating schools. Tudge has been largely invisible during the campaign after claims by former staffer Rachelle Miller that she was involved in consensual sexual relationship with Tudge which turned abusive, in one alleged instance, physically. Tudge has denied the allegations of abuse. Despite the prime minister, Scott Morrison, telling parliament in December that Tudge had stood aside as minister and would not be returning to the ministery, he later told journalists that Tudge was ‚Äútechnically‚Äù still the minister, still in cabinet and would be returning to the role after the election. An internal inquiry by a respected former public servant, Vivienne Thom, found Tudge had not breached ministerial standards, but a separate workplace lawsuit by Miller related to her time working in the offices of Tudge, and later Michaelia Cash, is still on foot and could result in a reported $500,000 in compensation. Tudge has said he has not been made aware of the reported payment and does not know what it relates to. The three-minute interview began circulating on a WeChat offical account, AU Life Life, on Thursday and has so far had 347 views. The account is run by one of Gladys Liu‚Äôs volunteers and has been shared among a volunteer group associated with treasurer Josh Frydenberg‚Äôs campaign. AULife Record has been sharing other Liberal party material, including reports by Liberal supporters of Alan Tudge‚Äôs campaign posters being vandalised. Tudge‚Äôs video interview appears designed to appeal to conservative Chinese voters, who make up 12% of the population in Kooyong (where Frydenberg is facing a challenge from an independent) and nearly 20% in Chisholm, the Liberals‚Äô most marginal seat. In the video, a Chinese man identified only as Marcus said young families are concerned about slipping Naplan standards, a growth in ‚Äúhate culture,‚Äù and ‚Äúsome toxic gender ideology entering the system‚Äù. He asked what families can do to guard against ‚Äúwoke‚Äù culture and protect the education system. Tudge replied: ‚ÄúOne would be to keep close eyes on what your kids are being taught, and if you have concerns, raise them.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe second thing would be to choose your schools carefully, different schools have different values which are imparted and it should reflect the values that you hold in your family. ‚ÄúAnd perhaps thirdly, I would say, think carefully who you will vote for. Certain political parties like, my political party, the Liberal party, you know what my views are as the education minister. ‚ÄúUnderstand the views of other political parties too, because they are not always the same. We want higher standards in Liberal party. We do want positive, optimistic views of Australia implanted in our kids, and we want good mainstream values being implanted as well. That‚Äôs what we stand for, so think about that too.‚Äù The caption on the video in Chinese makes reference to former prime minister Tony Abbott‚Äôs recent glowing endorsements of Tudge ‚Äúas the best education minister we have ever had‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe is a one of small number of courageous MPs who dare to point out to the education department the decline of Australian education standards and who defend Australia‚Äôs glorious history of development and the Judeo-Christian cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãthat underpin its success,‚Äù the caption said. The video does not carry any party authorisation.",News/Australia news,Alan Tudge emerges on WeChat to respond to questions about ‚Äòtoxic gender ideology‚Äô,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/alan-tudge-responds-to-questions-about-toxic-gender-ideology-in-wechat-interview
5/13/2022,"The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia ‚Äì a mere 225km walk away. The equivalent of walking by foot from London to Sheffield but through a war unseen in its scale in Europe since 1945 and towards the oncoming convoys of tanks, armoured vehicles and nervous trigger-happy Russian soldiers racing towards Mariupol; it meant sidestepping mines and crossing destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, where an erring step would lead to a 30ft drop to certain death; he would have to pass the smouldering homes and weeping men and women with their heartbreaking stories of death and suffering and their loss of will to live on. Pedin, a former ship‚Äôs cook, could not have known any of this ‚Äì and he did not prove to be invisible, he concedes, as he recounts his tale in the safety of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Indeed, such would be his extraordinary feat that on one remarkable night Russian soldiers at one of the many checkpoints he would pass through gathered in the quiet of the evening to hear his story, stuffing cigarettes into his pockets for the onward journey and wishing him luck. He may not have been invisible, Pedin repeats, the tears welling in a rare moment of emotion. But he was, he adds, lucky. Pedin‚Äôs final decision to leave Mariupol was made on 20 April, he recalls, when the Russian soldiers had reached his part of the city and were going house to house, shooting at will. There was already little left to stay for; there was scant food or water, the dead were piling up in the streets. Pedin prepared meticulously. He packed a bag, weighed it and challenged himself to reduce the initial 70-kilo weight to 50. The initial task for Pedin and Zhu-Zhu was to traverse the five kilometres to the city outskirts, an aim that he had little faith could be achieved. He left his home on Tkochenko-Petrenko street near Mariupol‚Äôs port at 6am on 23 April and it took two hours to stumble through the craters, twisted steel and unexploded ordnance, north up Kyprino Street, where dead bodies were strewn, and on to the Port City shopping mall. Russian soldiers were handing out food and water at the end of long queues of desperate ashen-faced people. He stole by the crowds, avoiding eye contact with the soldiers, and walked up Zaporizhzhia Road. ‚ÄúI looked like a vagabond to them, I was nothing. I was dirty and covered from dust, as my house had been filled with a fog of smoke. I walked out of the city by this motorway and at the top I turned around. I looked back down at the city and I said to myself, it was the right decision. I said goodbye. There was an explosion. I turned and walked on.‚Äù He walked by burnt-out military vehicles, just his dog and the noise of shelling behind him until a convoy of armoured vehicles, so heavy they made the asphalt under his feet tremble, swept past. He crouched down, taking Zhu-Zhu, terrified, into his coat, until they passed. ‚ÄúI was an invisible man then,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúWhat am I to them: who is this shadow?‚Äù His aim was the town of Nikolske, 20km away. By the time he reached the first houses, it was getting dark and very cold. ‚ÄúI saw a man ahead outside his house. He said, ‚ÄòYoung man would you like to drink with me. Today I buried my son. Let‚Äôs drink to my son.‚Äô‚Äù Pedin gave up drinking 15 years ago but he could not refuse. He had two shots of vodka, while his new friend emptied the bottle. ‚ÄúHe told me that Russians had killed his 16-year-old son on 3 March in Mariupol. Shrapnel had taken off his head. After he had disappeared he spent weeks looking for him in Mariupol. He found the grave, and Russian soldiers said he would have to dig him up with his hands if he wanted the body. He told me, ‚ÄòI want to die ‚Äì I will kill myself.‚Äô‚Äù Pedin slept on the couch that night, waking at 6am. He knew the only way out towards Zaporizhzhia was through the town. ‚ÄúAs I left the town there was a checkpoint: Chechens. They had seen me and two of them came towards me. ‚ÄòWhere are you going? Where have you come from,‚Äô they asked. ‚ÄòHave you been through the filtration camp.‚Äô‚Äù A commander appeared and called someone on a radio. ‚ÄúA minivan turned up and three big men came out and I was put in the van. We drove 2km back to Nikolske and came to a two-storey council building, which they had surrounded with steel fencing. There were about 40 people waiting in the grounds but the van drove to the building entrance.‚Äù Pedin left his bag outside and tied up Zhu-Zhu before being taken to the second floor. ‚ÄúA Russian officer sat in front of a desk asked me where I was going. I lied. I said I had a stomach ulcer and needed to get to Zaporizhzhia as I had paid for treatment. I was told to take off my top and they looked for tattoos. I had a bruise on my shoulder and they accused me of having had a rifle. He demanded, ‚Äòwhere are your tattoos?‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòYou are boring me. Maybe I should beat you?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòAs you wish, commander.‚Äô But I was taken to another room where there were four military women with PCs, and they scanned my fingerprints, put me up against a wall and took mugshots.‚Äù He was given a document from the so-called ministry of internal affairs of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic. He was free to leave and set off again with his dog and bag to the checkpoint. ‚ÄúThe Chechens said they would get the next car to take me to the next village at Rozivka. I was there for two hours. They were bored and talked to me, giving me cigarettes. None of the drivers would take me, so I said, guys, I will just walk. One said, ‚ÄòNo, this is my authority‚Äô, pointing at his gun.‚Äù After an hour, a black minivan pulled up and the Chechens demanded that the driver, who was travelling with his wife and two daughters, aged about 18 and 20, take Pedin. ‚ÄúNo one said a word. They took me to Rozivka. On the way, I noticed in the fields large diggers digging up holes. And further down there were crosses. I am sure they were mass graves.‚Äù On arrival at Rozivka, Pedin walked down Lenina street out of town and came to another checkpoint which he passed easily with his new document and kept on walking. By the time he came to the next village, Verzhyna, it was pitch black. ‚ÄúSuddenly flashlights blinded me. There were six soldiers, they barked at me, I put up my hands. They told me to take my top off, emptied my bag. It was freezing. They ordered me to follow them. We went inside the House of Culture [a community centre] which was their headquarters.‚Äù Pedin was given some canned beef and some soup and put in a small room that had a steel bed in the corner. He was told that if he left earlier than the morning that he would be shot ‚Äì but was free to go the following day. He crept past the sleeping soldiers in the morning and nodded to one on watch as he left. He walked for 14 hours that day reaching another checkpoint at around 8pm to be searched again. The soldiers pointed him towards a small abandoned house where he could sleep. But he was off again at 6am as the sun rose. ‚ÄúI saw a big man in his 60s. He asked, ‚ÄòWhere are you from?‚Äô I said Mariupol, and he called to his wife to bring food. They gave me a bag of bread, onion, fried pork, cucumber. They insisted. And I walked on.‚Äù By now, Pedin was exhausted and yet the greatest obstacle was to come. The road bridge he needed to pass over had been destroyed, leaving a 30-metre sheer drop on to railway tracks below. ‚ÄúYou can cheat people but not a destroyed bridge.‚Äù The bridge‚Äôs metal frame was still in place, however, with two beams: one narrow one below and one broader one at shoulder height. Pedin tied up his dog with his bag and tested the crossing. It was doable. He went back and crossed again with his bag. Then he returned and took his dog, who walked on the beam above, with Pedin holding the lead. ‚ÄúI just shouted, ‚ÄòWe did it.‚Äô‚Äù They approached the next checkpoint. The soldier demanded to know where my companion was. ‚ÄúI said I only had my dog. Then they wanted to know how I had crossed the bridge.‚Äù Pedin was told he could stay the night in the back half of a radio van that had been hit by a Ukrainian shell at the front. It was dark now. Pedin‚Äôs story was exactly the sort of diversion the bored soldiers needed. Five gathered around him, to hear of his adventures, and daring deeds across the bridge. ‚ÄúOne wanted to keep in touch, he was saying that after the war I should stay with him. There was nothing for me to say.‚Äù Pedin slept in his chair, with Zhu-Zhu under his coat. The next morning, he was told he was not allowed to carry on via the road to Zaporizhzhia but had to choose to go back or south to the city of Tokmak. Pedin headed towards the city but faced two big hills. ‚ÄúThe dog just couldn‚Äôt go on. I had to walk up the road with my bag, and then come back for him and carry him up. I said, ‚ÄòIf you don‚Äôt walk we will both die, you have to walk.‚Äô He walked up the next hill.‚Äù Off the road was Tarasivka, a small village. ‚ÄúI saw the top of the head of a man in a window and called to him. I gave him some of the soldiers‚Äô cigarettes, I even had menthol cigarettes. The only way to Zaporizhzhia was on small roads and over a dam and then to take what he said was the smugglers‚Äô track.‚Äù He did as he was instructed. But after the dam, there was a crossroads ‚Äì and no indication of which way to go. Pedin‚Äôs luck struck again. ‚ÄúA truck appeared. I called out. I said, ‚ÄòI am from Mariupol.‚Äô The door opened. We drove for two hours, through weaving roads. I would have never have found my way. We said nothing. At the checkpoints, this man said just two words to the Donetsk People‚Äôs Republic militia and he was let through.‚Äù Pedin saw a Ukrainian flag ahead, where soldiers checked the men‚Äôs documents and let them go. ‚ÄúThe driver dropped me in central Zaporizhzhia by a tent. He had said nothing on the journey but gave me 1,000 hryvnia (¬£30). He said good luck. He understood everything ‚Äì what was there to say?‚Äù Pedin walked into the tent, full of volunteers. He was asked by a woman whether he needed help. He went quiet and then said yes. ‚ÄúThe lady asked, ‚Äòwhere have you come from?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòI have come from Mariupol.‚Äô She screamed: ‚ÄòMariupol!‚Äô‚Äù Pedin recalls with a smile. ‚ÄúShe shouted out to everyone, this man has come from Mariupol on foot. Everyone stopped. I suppose it was my moment of glory.‚Äù",News/World news,The invisible Ukrainian who walked 225km to safety from Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/the-invisible-ukrainian-who-walked-225km-to-safety-from-mariupol
5/13/2022,"In the days after Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in late February, Vladimir Shurupov, a cardiologist from the Siberian city of Tomsk, felt he could not breathe properly. ‚ÄúI was having panic attacks, I could not eat or sleep. I just knew I had to remove myself from this place, from this atmosphere,‚Äù he said. Shurupov, 40, had been a quiet critic of Putin‚Äôs government for years, but he had never attended a protest of any kind, fearful of unwanted attention or arrest. When the war began, disgust with the regime combined with a fear he would be sent to the front. ‚ÄúIf there was mobilisation, I would have been called up as a military doctor, and this is not a war I would be willing to fight in,‚Äù he said. Shurupov discussed with his wife and two sons that perhaps they should try to leave the country. The family had minimal savings but he was able to sell his car for cash and buy four tickets to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Just two days after first discussing leaving, they flew out of Tomsk to Yerevan. After receiving Schengen visas, they moved on to Bulgaria. They have no plans ever to return home. The Shurupov family are among hundreds of thousands of Russians to have fled the country since the war began on 24 February. Putin has referred to such people as ‚Äútraitors and scum‚Äù and said their departure will help ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù Russian society. Many are opposition journalists or activists, whose work has in effect been criminalised under increasingly draconian wartime laws in Russia. Others are businesspeople fleeing sanctions. Some simply did not want to be part of a society where pro-war feelings are running so high. Shurupov estimated that of 30 colleagues at his hospital, only three were opposed to the war. Some of those who left in the days after the invasion have already decided to return, but many are set on making a new life abroad, at least until there are political changes in Russia. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to live behind a new iron curtain. I just had a feeling that there was no future in Russia,‚Äù said Valery Zolotukhin, 39, a literary and theatre scholar who came to Armenia with his wife and seven-year-old daughter. ‚ÄúIn Russia, you‚Äôre living inside the fantasy of a few people ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôve created an imaginary world and you‚Äôre forced to be part of it.‚Äù A century ago, after the Bolsheviks took over Russia, millions of √©migr√©s fled to Istanbul, Prague and Harbin. Today there is an echo of that process as the cafes of Vilnius, Tbilisi and Yerevan are packed with Russians in the first stages of building a new life. Armenia is one of the most popular destinations, because no visa is required. It has also created favourable conditions for IT businesses, prompting the relocation of thousands of Russian tech professionals over the past two months. ‚ÄúAt the beginning, you walked down the street and saw all your friends from Moscow, and the people from St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod you only normally see on Zoom calls,‚Äù said Maya Gorodova, a former commercial director at Russian startups, who has set up a coworking space in Yerevan with views to Mount Ararat from the windows. All 70 current tenants are recent arrivals from Russia, and Gorodova has received calls from Russians in Belgrade, Tbilisi, Tel Aviv and Bali, she said, asking for advice on setting up new work spaces for √©migr√©s. The outflow of tech professionals is likely to be a huge blow for Russia, which in recent years has become a highly digitised economy. But opposition to the war, a fear of possible mobilisation and the loss of contracts with foreign clients due to sanctions have combined to push many to the exit. At Hummus Kimchi, a new restaurant run by a brother and sister team transplanted from Moscow, recent arrivals to Yerevan discuss their next moves. Some have their eye on Britain‚Äôs Global Talent visa and have paid thousands of pounds to agents who promise to craft their forms to match the Home Office‚Äôs checklist. Others note that Germany offers citizenship within five years for arriving IT specialists. ‚ÄúOf course these are all reserve options,‚Äù said one young tech professional, sipping a craft beer. ‚ÄúHopefully, Putin will die soon and we can all go back.‚Äù For many who have left, emigration was the final moment in a life of gritty opposition activity, including arrests and house searches. For others it was the start of a political awakening. One woman in her 30s, who did not want her name published, said she had always opposed Putin but had been too fearful to attend protests or post on Facebook. On the second day of the war she wore clothes in Ukrainian colours to work, and her colleagues began insulting her. She realised nobody in her social group shared her revulsion over the invasion. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to talk to any of my friends, I started chats with a few of them and it feels like they are just pressing control C, control V. They‚Äôre all repeating the same phrases,‚Äù she said. She also left behind a long-term boyfriend who works in Russia‚Äôs security services. Previously they had not discussed politics much, but before departing she wrote him a long letter setting out her opposition to the war. They have hardly spoken since. ‚ÄúIn a short time here I met more people who think like me than I did in the last few years in Moscow. And I realised that here I‚Äôve stopped always calculating what I should say based on who I‚Äôm talking to. I feel so much freer,‚Äù she said. Many Russians in Yerevan spend long hours in the city‚Äôs cafes and bars, philosophising about whether there was any way to have stopped Putin earlier, and whether they should have done more. Some remain worried about repercussions at home and speak in mealy mouthed euphemisms about ‚Äúthe unfortunate events‚Äù or ‚Äúthe Ukrainian situation‚Äù. Others are eager to express their wholehearted support for Ukraine. In Moscow, Elena Kamay ran Lambada Markets, which put on street markets beloved by the city‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúcreative class‚Äù that has sprung up over the past decade. Stalls sold vintage clothing, items by local designers and other artisan objects. ‚ÄúOf course it was all a facade, we lived in a bubble. And now it‚Äôs all over,‚Äù she said. Kamay moved to Yerevan at the beginning of March, and like many has been thinking back over the past decade from today‚Äôs vantage point. She accepted that working in Moscow had involved ‚Äúdoing a deal with your conscience‚Äù, though she said she had been attending anti-government protests since 2011. Recently, she said, she had been rereading messages she had exchanged with Oksana Baulina, a Russian activist and journalist who left Russia two years ago and was killed by a Russian airstrike in Kyiv in March while reporting. ‚ÄúI always thought she was exaggerating a bit when she described her views about Russia and the political system, but it turns out she was right all along,‚Äù she said. Elena Chegodayeva also arrived in Yerevan in March, and a few weeks later set up a school from an apartment in the city centre. The 50 pupils and 20 teachers have all recently arrived from Russia. Chegodayeva said she had been pondering the concept of collective responsibility since the war started. ‚ÄúWe are all Russians and we will have to take responsibility for this, just like Germans had to after the war,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOn the other hand, I was two years old when Putin was elected, so it‚Äôs not entirely clear what more I could have done.‚Äù Chegodayeva, 24, said she had lost part of her university stipend for arguing with her professor about whether the annexation of Crimea was illegal, and received dawn visits to her apartment from police after taking part in protests. She said the case of a St Petersburg artist who faces 10 years in jail for replacing supermarket price tags with anti-war slogans showed protest in Russia now was futile. She will only return to Russia ‚Äúif there is revolution in the air‚Äù, she said. Rather than try to persuade people to stay, Putin has celebrated the outflow of hundreds of thousands of educated, anti-war Russians. In a sinister video address in the middle of March, Putin criticised those who moved abroad or supported the west in its current battle with Moscow. ‚ÄúAny people, and particularly the Russian people, are able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and simply spit them out like a fly that flew into their mouths,‚Äù he said, using some of the harshest language of his two decades in charge. There would be a ‚Äúnatural and necessary cleansing of society‚Äù, said Putin, which would be beneficial to the country in the long run. The question now is whether those who have left will gradually disconnect themselves from Russia, or form a powerful opposition to Putin and his regime from outside, rallying around political forces such as associates of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who are mostly now based in Vilnius. ‚ÄúFor 100 years, the understanding of emigration was that people quickly lost touch with Russia and didn‚Äôt understand it, so nobody believed the political emigration might have a chance of playing a role in Russian politics,‚Äù said Andrei Soldatov, a co-author with Irina Borogan of a recent book about the history of Russians outside Russia. Now, however, the internet opens up very different possibilities. ‚ÄúThe country is still connected to the world. So many Russian journalists left the country and still have contact with their audiences, and this is an absolutely new development for the Kremlin,‚Äù Soldatov said. Before trying to change the regime, many of the √©migr√©s are first focused on trying to change the mind of war-supporting family members who have stayed behind, refusing to leave. Shurupov hopes his mother will eventually join the family in Europe, but so far she is resisting. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been able to convince her about the war, and she doesn‚Äôt want to leave. For me, this is a real tragedy.‚Äù",News/World news,Russian √©migr√©s fleeing Putin‚Äôs war find freedom in the cafes of Armenia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/russia-emigres-putin-war-ukraine-armenia
5/13/2022,"If you want to know how much Scott Morrison wants to win this election campaign, I recommend you watch the footage from Friday‚Äôs press conference. Morrison wants to win enough to execute a humility flip. The Liberal campaign has been struggling with its Morrison problem right from the get go. The prime minister is largely a positive for the Coalition in the regions and outer suburbs, but in the Liberal party‚Äôs disillusioned progressive heartland, Morrison is seen as irredeemably toxic. The campaign‚Äôs first response to this problem has been Operation Permission To Distance. Liberals in marginal seats have been actively differentiating themselves from Morrison for weeks; even the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, close enough to the prime minister to bunk in with him at the Lodge, now puts his differences with Morrison on high rotation. But evidently, that‚Äôs not enough. Morrison now has to distance from Morrison. He‚Äôs created Morrison 2.0. The prime minister‚Äôs messaging on Friday tells us he understands he‚Äôs a barrier to entry for many voters, including people who have voted Liberal all their lives. So Morrison 2.0 ‚Äì birthed at a press conference ‚Äì gets things wrong, but he also learns from his mistakes and strives to do better. Morrison 2.0 has a positive agenda for the country and a belief that things will be better now we are out of the pandemic that we aren‚Äôt actually out of. Morrison 2.0 has happy, productive thoughts, ideas and plans as well as an insatiable hunger to list Anthony ‚Äúloose unit‚Äù Albanese‚Äôs character deficiencies several times a day down to the footnotes, in an effort to spare Australians from the miserable fate that apparently awaits them under Labor. Morrison 2.0 even revealed that the beta version ‚Äì that would be the prime minister we‚Äôve all seen in a variety of contexts over the last four and a bit years, the person with very clear and seemingly fixed character traits ‚Äì was ‚Äúa bit of a bulldozer‚Äù. (Guys. Can you believe it? Who knew?) Most tellingly of all, Morrison 2.0 acknowledged that beta Morrison had to change. ‚ÄúAs we go into this next period on the other side of this election, I know there are things that are going to have to change with the way I do things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are moving into a different time. We are moving into a time of opportunity and working from the strong platform of strength that we‚Äôve built and saved in our economy in the last three years we can now take advantage of those opportunities in the future.‚Äù Extraordinary is an overused word in political commentary, but it truly was extraordinary to see this person, the person who declared shortly after taking the prime ministership that like General Norman Schwarzkopf, when placed in command, he would ‚Äútake charge‚Äù ‚Äì suddenly unleash an entirely new prime ministerial character. One that could brook criticism without sulking. One who could sometimes be wrong. One prepared to listen. One prepared to learn. I say on behalf of the women of Australia ‚Äì where was this prime minister, the humble and empathic leader the country needed during the cultural reckoning of the past 12 months? I say to Morrison directly: where were you when you were needed (as opposed to when you needed to win an election)? Seriously, how dare you. If Morrison could learn (as opposed, to managing, strategising, spinning and fixing) ‚Äì if this was actually an option, why has he spent the past four years point blank refusing to do so? Morrison‚Äôs stubborn refusal to read the room and be different is the main reason he‚Äôs in political trouble now, because Australians can easily recognise forceful characters who always know best, the people who are righteous in their obduracy, people imagine themselves saviours when they are human, and therefore flawed. Let‚Äôs consider why Morrison is pulling his own version of ‚Äúreal Julia‚Äù (Gillard‚Äôs attempted campaign flip in 2010). The reason is simple. Morrison has a strategy to win, but he doesn‚Äôt know whether his strategy is going to work. He‚Äôs uncertain. I can see this sensation he‚Äôs battling because it‚Äôs brand new, I‚Äôve never seen him battle it before. It‚Äôs doubt. Morrison‚Äôs imperative during the final week of the 2022 campaign is hold the base and firm up the soft vote. Morrison has shored up Clive Palmer‚Äôs preferences in the seats that matter and given the swinging Liberals who might vote Labor, independent or insurgent, a list of reasons not to do that. He‚Äôs landed some blows on Albanese during the campaign as he‚Äôs sought to weight his gravity-defying opponent as a risk. But the torrent of the ad hominem and negativity has obscured the Coalition‚Äôs positive messages to the point where swinging voters are wondering whether this government has anything at all to say about the future. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In this final week, Morrison must now communicate with the people he‚Äôs persuaded to hesitate. Unfortunately for him, some of these voters loathe him. His first pitch to this group was: I know you don‚Äôt like me but you know I‚Äôm good at my job. Unfortunately for him, they don‚Äôt know that. So now Morrison has to be better at his job, which is what he told this cohort on Friday. He laced his mea culpa with hope and aspiration and an overlay of Labor‚Äôs campaign messaging, hoping for a convergence, hoping for his May miracle. He might still get it. If anyone can get it, this bloke can, because his political ruthlessness knows no bounds. He is a narrowcaster par excellence. But the Coalition is in trouble. Friday‚Äôs Morrison 2.0 mea culpa isn‚Äôt the dawn of self-knowledge.

Last year at a family gathering, my eldest sister witnessed me giving my husband a quick peck on the cheek and flew into a homophobic-tinged rage, accusing us of ‚Äúrubbing our relationship in her face‚Äù. Being a queer couple, I felt like her anger was disproportionate to the level of affection publicly displayed (this was a quick peck, not a prolonged session of tonsil tennis). The rest of the family was shocked, but no one came to our defence. It was humiliating. I was left with feelings of internalised homophobia I thought I‚Äôd worked through in my early 20s. I feel anxious even holding my husband‚Äôs hand in public now. My sister has not apologised, and I have heard through another family member that most of the family have sided with her, due to her history of depression and recent divorce. They (sister included) are all in denial of the homophobic nature of her outburst and have implied that I am being overly sensitive (they‚Äôre not entirely wrong). My husband thinks I should cut them out of my life, but before I do anything drastic, is there a way to bring this up with them that is constructive for all parties involved? Eleanor says: I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. It‚Äôs awful to realise the people we thought would defend us weren‚Äôt as brave as we hoped. You asked if there was a way to bring this up that would feel productive. I wonder whether it might be useful, in conversations with your family, to separate impact from intent. Based on what you‚Äôve written, I‚Äôm inclined to agree that homophobia was simmering in what your sister did ‚Äì the old chestnut of ‚Äúrubbing in my face‚Äù sounds a lot like ‚Äúbut why do you have to do it in public?‚Äù. Unfortunately, one of the more insidious features of homophobia ‚Äì like ableism or racism or any other prejudice ‚Äì is that the people who most enact it often recognise it the least. Right after saying something straight from the homophobia playbook, they‚Äôll insist they don‚Äôt have the feelings you‚Äôre accusing them of, that there‚Äôs no animus; that prejudice plays no role in their mental life. It‚Äôs like watching a marionette swear they‚Äôre moving on their own. This makes a dilemma for someone in your position: do you litigate the case that they do seem to have the feelings they disavow? Or do you focus on telling them how they‚Äôve hurt you instead? It‚Äôs annoying, but I wonder whether focusing on how your sister‚Äôs action affected you ‚Äì rather than its origins ‚Äì might help. It could give you something to say that your family could be more able to hear. For instance, if you‚Äôre close enough to feel comfortable telling them, you could share the things they don‚Äôt know about how homophobia has coloured your life. Things about how people spoke to you, treated you; why it took this much bravery to hold your husband‚Äôs hand and why that feels fragile, even now. If they had a better understanding of why this reopened certain wounds for you, and why they hurt so much in the first place, they might ‚Äì might ‚Äì be better able to see why you wanted their help. Sometimes family disputes fracture along these lines: one side trying to say ‚Äúyou really hurt me‚Äù and the other indignantly replying ‚Äúhow dare you accuse me of trying to hurt you‚Äù. Focusing on what this meant to you regardless of intention might make it feel less like a battle between siblings over who knows the truth, and more like a request for solidarity and understanding. Your family should want to protect you from things that hurt you ‚Äì whatever your sister really meant, everyone should be able to agree on that. And whether something hurts you isn‚Äôt up to them. As to your sister‚Äôs circumstances at the moment. Lawyers and ethicists sometimes distinguish between a justification and an excuse. To have a justification for an action means it‚Äôs no longer wrong; to have an excuse just means you won‚Äôt get in trouble although we all still agree it was bad. With a lot of grace you might think your sister has an excuse. But grace has to run both ways ‚Äì she should handle your pain and history and with as much consideration as she‚Äôs asking for hers. If your family can‚Äôt respond to either of these points, your husband may be right ‚Äì at a certain point, the standard you walk past is the standard you accept.

5/13/2022,"Acclaimed Dhungatti artist Blak Douglas ‚Äì born Adam Douglas Hill ‚Äì has won the 2022 Archibald prize, for his portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens, titled Moby Dickens. Douglas collected the $100,000 prize on Friday, at the Art Gallery of NSW. It‚Äôs the second time an Indigenous Australian has won the prize in 101 years, after Vincent Namatjira in 2020. Dickens, who is based on Bundjalung country in Lismore, is painted holding drenched and leaking buckets while standing ankle-deep in flood water. ‚ÄúKarla is my favourite female First Nations artist, we are dear friends, we are birds of a feather when it comes to our sentiment in art, and I really admire the way she pieces together her work,‚Äù Douglas said in a statement. ‚ÄúI was there in Lismore immediately after the first deluge ‚Ä¶ and saw the shock and horror on people‚Äôs faces. Karla had just reached a pivotal point in her career and almost immediately the flood catastrophe happened. So, when she should have ordinarily been excited about where her career was going, she was harbouring three families in Lismore as part of her own rescue mission.‚Äù The murky waters he painted represent more than the devastating floods that claimed more than 3,600 homes in the northern rivers region earlier this year. ‚ÄúI see them as a metaphor for the art world,‚Äù Douglas told press at the announcement. ‚ÄúYou have to take a swim across a murky estuary to find your goal ‚Ä¶ and the leaking buckets is a metaphor for the 50% commission that somebody has set in the landscape of art, which can make it very hard when you‚Äôre an emerging artist and you‚Äôre climbing a ladder to get to the next tier.‚Äù Dickens‚Äô expression, which appears to be something of a cross between anger, fear and determination, ‚Äúencaptures how Lismore is feeling about the incredibly lacklustre efforts of the current government in dealing out crisis relief,‚Äù he said. The 14 flat-bottomed clouds behind her represent the numbers of days and nights that the first flood lasted in Lismore. At 3m by 2m, it‚Äôs the largest painting on show at the Archibald exhibition. Douglas has been an Archibald finalist seven times. ‚ÄúAs Ben Quilty told me, just keep entering and eventually you‚Äôll win,‚Äù the artist joked. Taking aim at the Archibald‚Äôs long history of hanging portraits painted by white men depicting white men, until very recently, he described his win as a ‚Äúdouble whammy‚Äù. In his acceptance speech, he said First Nations artists were ‚Äúdealt rough end of the stick‚Äù. ‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs time, for us it‚Äôs time,‚Äù he said. Jude Rae was highly commended for her portrait of inventor and engineer Dr Saul Griffith. Nicholas Harding won the $50,000 Wynne prize for landscape painting of Australian scenery or figurative sculpture, with his oil on linen work Eora. Harding has been a Wynne finalist nine times ‚Äì and is a 19-time finalist of the Archibald prize. Juz Kitson and Lucy Culliton were both highly commended for the Wynne. The $40,000 Sulman prize for best subject painting, genre painting or mural project in oil, acrylic, watercolour or mixed media, was won by Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro for Raik≈ç and Shuten-d≈çji, a rendering of the fight between the warrior Raik≈ç and the demon Shuten-d≈çji, painted on the fuselage of a Vietnam War-era helicopter. On 5 May Sydney-based artist Claus Stangl won the Archibald‚Äôs packing room prize ‚Äì judged by those who unpack and hang the portraits ‚Äì for his 3D-style portrait of New Zealand film director, writer and actor Taika Waititi. It was the final pick from head packer Brett Cuthbertson, who is retiring after 41 years with the gallery. The Waititi portrait is among 52 hung in this year‚Äôs exhibition, including paintings of Helen Garner, Benjamin Law, Peter Garrett and Courtney Act; they were chosen from a selection of more than 800 entries, in a prize judged by the art gallery‚Äôs trustees. Twenty Indigenous artists entered the Archibald ‚Äì a record for the prize ‚Äì and there were 27 Indigenous finalists among the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes. This year‚Äôs Archibald finalist exhibition also includes five vibrant works from Studio A: a Sydney collective of artists with intellectual disability who have had their most successful year to date. The finalists in all three prizes will be exhibited at the Art Gallery of NSW from 14 May to 28 August 2022.",Arts/Art and design,"Archibald prize 2022: Blak Douglas wins $100,000 for portrait of Lismore artist Karla Dickens",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/13/archibald-prize-2022-blak-douglas-wins-100000-for-portrait-of-lismore-artist-karla-dickens
5/13/2022,"New Zealand‚Äôs presbyterian church will offer any future land sales to MƒÅori iwi first, as the institution reckons with its role in colonisation and land confiscations in Aotearoa. The institution is a significant landowner across the country, with more than $1.5bn in land assets and 400 properties. Their decision comes at a time of increasing scrutiny on the church and its role in the colonisation of New Zealand, including as a beneficiary of confiscated or stolen land. Rev Dr Wayne Te Kaawa told TVNZ that the church now wanted to be on the right side of history. ‚ÄúSome of our ministers were chaplains to the forces in the New Zealand Land Wars and they gave eucharist and blessings to all those soldiers who fought there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been on the other side of history as a church, but this time we‚Äôre taking a different stance and have decided issues like justice and the treaty and honouring the Treaty and our MƒÅori partners [are important].‚Äù The church has said that while some of its land was acquired through land sales and gifts, parts were likely taken by the crown following the New Zealand land wars of the 1860s. More than 4 million acres of MƒÅori land were confiscated by the crown, often as punishment. Much of it has never returned. While the church has made some gifts of land back to iwi, this decision will cover all future land sales across the country and give first right of refusal to the tribal authorities. In meeting records of the decision, the church wrote that churches could make those offers at below market rate, although the final ratified decision did not prescribe that. ‚ÄúThe church owns a significant amount of land. Each year a small number of these titles come up for sale. By offering MƒÅori the right of first refusal ‚Ä¶ this is one way the church can honour its treaty commitments.‚Äù Moderator Marina Rakuraku told the assembly that the church ‚Äúshould differentiate between land that had been gifted and land that had been sold. Gifted land ought to be returned as a gift.‚Äù Te Kaawa said the purchasing agreement had been a long time coming, but was a step in the right direction for the church. ‚ÄúI felt an overwhelming sense of pride,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI also felt a tinge of sadness, thinking back to all of those MƒÅori in the church who have raised land issues, and it‚Äôs never gone anywhere.‚Äù The vote was carried 121 to 12.",News/World news,New Zealand‚Äôs presbyterian church will offer future land sales to MƒÅori iwi first,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/new-zealands-presbyterian-church-will-offer-future-land-sales-to-maori-iwi-first
5/13/2022,"With just over a week until polling day in the federal election, people are still searching Google for the answer to questions such as ‚Äúwhich party is ScoMo in?‚Äù and ‚Äúwho should I vote for?‚Äù. In week five of the campaign, the top breakout search according to trend data provided by Google is the one on everyone‚Äôs mind: ‚ÄúWho is winning?‚Äù But during Sunday‚Äôs debate on Channel Nine, people were also asking what party Morrison is in, when he became prime minister and ‚Äúhow do you define a woman, ScoMo?‚Äù. Search interest in ‚ÄúScott Morrison transgender‚Äù has tripled in the past seven days, as the prime minister backed in the Warringah Liberal candidate, Katherine Deves, over her retracted apology for offensive comments about transgender children. Dr Glenn Kefford, a lecturer in political science at the University of Queensland, said many voters only paid close attention to politics around key moments in the electoral cycle. ‚ÄúAs the polls are now open, this is the time that voters are starting to think seriously about their decision,‚Äù Kefford said. ‚ÄúThe decisions that voters make are often guided by partisan leanings as well as perceptions of political leaders.‚Äù He said people may have been searching for what party Morrison is in because he ‚Äúis one of the more polarising figures in Australian federal politics in recent years and it appears that many voters have made their minds up about him‚Äù. ‚ÄúSearching for ‚Äòwhat party ScoMo is in‚Äô, suggests voters want to know that information to know who to vote or not to vote for,‚Äù he said.

A donkey vote is where people number the candidates from top to bottom (or vice versa) in numerical order. It counts as a valid vote. It is different from an informal vote, which means the ballot was not marked or was not marked correctly. Kefford said people searching for donkey voting could mean voters were dissatisfied with the options, or just generally trying to understand how voting worked. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs a good thing,‚Äù he said. Over the past few weeks the top search result has been ABC‚Äôs Vote Compass. Kefford said the search shows many voters are undecided, as indicated by the polls. ‚ÄúWhat we know from the political science literature is that some of these voters will probably still return to one of the major parties, while others are open to alternatives we are seeing emerge across the country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSecond, that for many voters, this election may be decided on how they view Morrison.‚Äù Perhaps owing to a number of stories about fake corflutes or corflutes being vandalised or pulled down ‚Äì and in Goldstein subject to a legal battle ‚Äì searches related to corflutes have almost doubled since the 2016 election, with the top search being ‚Äúwhat is a corflute‚Äù.

5/13/2022,"A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial of the invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, a commander in Russia‚Äôs Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of shooting dead an unarmed man, 62, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone in the village of Chupakhivka, Sumy. Shysimarin was ordered ‚Äúto kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders‚Äù, according to prosecutors. The Russian foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take ‚Äúmilitary-technical‚Äù steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession, after Finland‚Äôs president, Sauli Niinist√∂, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, said it must apply to join the military alliance ‚Äúwithout delay‚Äù. Sweden is expected to follow within days. Russia could cut its gas supplies to Finland on Friday, a day after Finnish leaders said they would apply to join Nato, according to reports. The Republican senator Rand Paul has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill for Ukraine in the US Senate. Paul demanded changes including an inspector general to oversee how it is spent. Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that ‚Äúat least several thousand Ukrainians‚Äù have been sent to so-called ‚Äúfiltration centres‚Äù in Russia where they are subject to ‚Äúbrutal interrogations‚Äù. Tens of thousands more had been evacuated to Russia or Russia-controlled territory. Carpenter said that one survivor said ‚Äúeveryone was afraid to be taken to Donetsk‚Äù, where they could be the victim of ‚Äúfurther investigation or murder‚Äù. Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine‚Äôs ports, including by trying to open routes through Romania and the Baltic, are being discussed at a three-day meeting of G7 foreign and agriculture ministers in Germany. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine ‚Äì enough to feed 400 million people ‚Äì was exported through its seven Black Sea ports. Ukraine said it had damaged and set on fire a Russian navy logistics ship in the Black Sea. The Vsevolod Bobrov was near Snake Island, said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration in southern Ukraine. The Guardian could not independently verify the details and Russia‚Äôs defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ukraine‚Äôs deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said ‚Äúvery difficult negotiations‚Äù were ongoing to evacuate 38 seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. ‚ÄúWe work step by step,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe will exchange 38, then we will move on.‚Äù The number of people who have fled Ukraine to escape Russia‚Äôs invasion has exceeded six million, the UN‚Äôs refugee agency has said. A further eight million people have been displaced inside Ukraine. Nearly 100 children were killed in Ukraine during April alone but actual figures could be significantly higher, the United Nations children‚Äôs fund has said. Unicef‚Äôs deputy executive director, Omar Abdi, demanded an end to the bombing of Ukrainian schools, adding that one in six Unicef-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been ‚Äúdamaged or destroyed‚Äù as of last week.

5/13/2022,"As a magician‚Äôs audience suspends its disbelief, in Australia‚Äôs parliament you aren‚Äôt allowed to call someone a liar. But in the real world people say it out loud; they don‚Äôt trust politicians. That‚Äôs depressing, particularly in the middle of an election campaign when voters are about to exercise their democratic right. Aristotle had his doubts about democracy. He knew persuasion ‚Äì the language of our politics ‚Äì has a much lower evidence bar than the rigorous logic used in science; you can persuade people merely by ‚Äúseeming to prove‚Äù a truth. Fast-forward to the US political strategist James Carville‚Äôs boast: ‚ÄúTruth is what you can make the voter think it is.‚Äù We‚Äôre getting better at recognising the bald-faced lie ‚Äì the one that instantly fails the pub test. But other ways of tinkering with the truth are harder to spot. Cue fallacies: believable arguments based on false reasoning. Some politicians use fallacies all the time, all use them some of the time: to deflect and distract and to win arguments, rather than deal head-on with difficult policy issues. Here are seven fallacies (a far from exhaustive list) to watch out for. The strawman strategy is to set up a distorted, easily refuted, version of your opponent‚Äôs position and attack that instead. So Labor is soft on China, says the Coalition when it‚Äôs criticised over the Solomon Islands deal. And a policy debate with a teal independent turns instead to their links to Simon Holmes √† Court. In both cases the strawman argument is set up to deflect. The converse is steelmanning: dealing directly with the issue, even helping your opponent build their best argument, and then demolishing that. It‚Äôs the soundest way to argue if you really want to come up with a constructive solution to a problem (and if you manage to find a politician who prefers to steelman, vote for them quickly before they change their mind!). As London mayor, Boris Johnson was upfront about using the ‚Äúafter this, therefore because of this‚Äù fallacy when discussing the effects of the city‚Äôs hosting of the 2012 Olympic Games: ‚ÄúPost hoc ergo propter hoc ‚Äì we‚Äôve won the cricket, the rugby and qualified for the World Cup. Can I claim them as an Olympic benefit? I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm going to try.‚Äù Political parties take credit for anything positive that happens on their watch and slam others for anything negative that happens on theirs. So the Coalition takes credit for low unemployment and is blamed by the opposition for the rise in inflation and interest rates. But correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. If a politician says you‚Äôre either with them or against them, don‚Äôt take the bait. They‚Äôre painting a situation in black and white when there are many shades of grey: think pandemic policy framed in zero-sum terms as a choice between health and the economy, or the claim climate change action will necessarily hurt jobs. (The already mentioned Solomon Islands strawman does double time as a false dilemma). Such framing oversimplifies complex issues into two mutually exclusive choices, when there are actually many possible policy responses. This type of argument has been employed in debates on assisted dying and asylum seeker policy. It posits a certain course of action will lead to a (hypothetical) extreme result, and it‚Äôs often accompanied by an appeal to fear (see below) rather than evidence. Labor has used this strategy to claim the Coalition will expand the cashless welfare card to pensioners. And both sides of the federal integrity commission debate have employed the slippery slope fallacy ‚Äì one to argue about the danger to our democracy if politicians aren‚Äôt held accountable, and the other to warn of the threat posed by ‚Äúkangaroo courts‚Äù. Scare campaigns have worked before ‚Äì Mediscare in 2016 and ‚Äúdeath taxes‚Äù in 2019 ‚Äì and may again. We‚Äôve heard this time that Labor‚Äôs changes to the safeguard mechanism will be a carbon tax by stealth, that the independents are threats to national security, and again that the Coalition will weaken Medicare. Even without evidence, such claims fall on receptive ears. Voters are susceptible to fears that play into stereotypes. If the Coalition is viewed as stronger on the economy and security and Labor is trusted more on health and education, arguments that fit into those biases are an easy sell. Selectively using data that supports your proposition ‚Äì and ignoring what doesn‚Äôt. Examples are the claim by the Coalition that Australia‚Äôs carbon emissions have fallen by 20% and Labor‚Äôs assertion that Australia‚Äôs debt is higher than it has ever been. Both claims are disingenuous, as they omit to mention critical caveats about the data. Targeting Scott Morrison‚Äôs religion, calling the Greens ‚Äúwoke warriors‚Äù and independent candidates ‚Äúanti-Liberal groupies‚Äù or suggesting Anthony Albanese is hypocritical to own an investment property are all ad hominem attacks on a person or group, rather than the argument they are putting forward. So is calling the Guardian ‚Äúa trashy publication‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lazy distraction, and mean-spirited. Such fallacious arguments only weaken political debate. But much of the time they go unnoticed, and are likely to fall under the radar of any official truth-in-advertising or integrity accounting. The only thing a voter can do is learn to recognise them and avoid falling for them. You might not be able to keep the bastards completely honest ‚Äì but at least you won‚Äôt be taken for a mug.
