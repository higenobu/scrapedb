3/15/2022,"The former leader of the Proud Boys, a violent far-right nationalist group whose members were prominent in the January 6 riot, was found in possession of comprehensive plans to “surveil and storm” government buildings, prosecutors have said. Enrique Tarrio, the group’s former chairman who was arrested last week and charged with conspiracy over the deadly attack, had a nine-page document entitled “1776 Returns”, named for the year of American independence, the New York Times reported. The document, mentioned only in general terms in Tarrio’s indictment, contained details of a complex plan for supporters of Donald Trump to invade and occupy at least seven House and Senate office buildings on the afternoon Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s election victory, according to Times sources. Trump has promoted the lie that the election was stolen and incited the attack on Congress as part of a wider effort to have the result overturned. The document features five sections, the Times reported: infiltrate, execution, distract, occupy and sit-in. The plan called for the recruiting of at least 50 Proud Boys and other Trump supporters to enter and occupy each building, “causing trouble” for security personnel who tried to stop them. Once inside, the instructions stated, the activists would be encouraged to chant slogans such as “We the People” and “No Trump, no America”. Supporters unable to gain access to the buildings would be encouraged to distract law enforcement and other authorities by “pulling fire alarms at nearby stores, hotels and museums”. In the days before 6 January, Proud Boys were to undertake reconnaissance of roads near the seven buildings, looking out for roadblocks and other obstacles. Questions remain over the origin of the document and whether Tarrio, 38, shared it with any of the individuals charged alongside him. They are Ethan Nordean, 31, of Auburn, Washington; Joseph Biggs, 38, of Ormond Beach, Florida; Zachary Rehl, 36, of Philadelphia; Charles Donohoe, 34, of Kernersville, North Carolina; and Dominic Pezzola, 44, of Rochester, New York. But its existence lends context to the US justice department decision to charge Tarrio with conspiracy, even though he was not in Washington on the day of the riot. According to the indictment, Tarrio “nonetheless continued to direct and encourage the Proud Boys prior to and during the events of 6 January 2021” and later “claimed credit for what had happened on social media and in an encrypted chat room during and after the attack”. Tarrio has denied involvement in planning the riot. His lawyer, Nayib Hassan, declined comment to the Times. More than 770 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot, at least 30 members of the Proud Boys, court records show. Tarrio, from Miami, recently stood down as chair of the group, after being sentenced last year to five months in prison for burning a Black Lives Matter banner and unlawfully bringing weapons to a Washington protest. He was also exposed last year as a long-time informant for the FBI and local law enforcement agencies.",News/US news,Proud Boys leader had plans to ‘storm’ government buildings on 6 January,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/proud-boys-leader-enrique-tarrio-document-january-6
3/15/2022,"The prospect of fracking in England has been dealt another blow as only a handful of MPs for constituencies with exploration licences support the measure in their area, the Guardian can reveal. When asked if they would support fracking in their constituencies, only five of the 138 MPs said they would. Forty one said they would be against it, while the rest did not reply, or declined to comment. Many of the areas where fracking could be a possibility are in the “red wall”, with Conservative MPs representing those seats perhaps aware that their position could be difficult come the next general election. One such MP, Alexander Stafford, won the 2019 election in Rother Valley, in South Yorkshire, a seat that had been Labour since it was created in 1918. He said he was “very much against” fracking in his area, adding: “It is yesterday’s technology and will not solve our cost problems. It will take far too long to roll out. We must wean ourselves off hydrocarbons – which leave us in hock to awful dictators like Putin, or at the mercy of fluctuating international energy prices.” At the other end of England, seats in largely Tory areas, including Surrey, Sussex and Dorset are covered by fracking licences. Mims Davies, employment minister and MP for Mid Sussex, was clear there was no local support for fracking in her constituency or other affected areas. She said: “I believe that shale gas exploration should only proceed with local support and as long as it is safe and environmentally responsible to the nearby communities. Alongside my own concerns about the potential impact of this type of drilling in special areas like Mid Sussex, I have previously written on behalf, and in support, of my deeply worried constituents in Cuckfield, regarding planning matters at a controversial site in the small village of Balcombe. This site is just outside of my constituency but in the Mid Sussex district.” Environmental campaigners expressed alarm last week when the government indicated it would look again at fracking, a controversial technique designed to recover gas and oil from shale rock. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said “all options”, including fracking, would be considered before the energy strategy, expected in the coming days, was completed. This came after a group of backbench Conservative MPs, including members of the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, lobbied for the government to change its stance on fracking, and last week hosted members of the shale gas industry in parliament. Steve Baker, a trustee of the climate sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, told reporters: “Under the government’s plans, we will need vast quantities of gas even as renewables are ramped up. It is time for all of us to listen to facts, not scare stories. The shale gas industry needs a level playing field and an end to hysterical misinformation.” But he is unlikely to find support from colleagues in the areas covered by active onshore exploration licences, of which his constituency, Wycombe, is not one. Local communities have protested strongly and often successfully against past fracking attempts in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Sussex. Their concerns included the climate crisis, earth tremors and high levels of HGV traffic – 50 a day at one proposed site, and fears of water, air and noise pollution. The problem of the disposal of contaminated water from wells has also been raised. Fracking is not only politically difficult. Experts say that it could also be almost impossible to produce enough energy to justify the environmental and climate damage. The areas being considered for fracking are those rich in shale rocks. The Bowland shale rocks, in northern England, were formed more than 300m years ago as sediments, and organic material was buried in an ocean basin. Tectonic activity since then has folded the rocks towards the UK’s east and west coasts, making them more accessible. But though this area contains shale gas, scientists say it will be very difficult to extract. The tectonic activity has left a complex geological situation, which makes the shales significantly harder to exploit than the simpler formations in the US. “We have the wrong kind of geology, small geological basins rather than vast tracts of identical geology,” said Prof Jon Gluyas, an energy specialist at Durham University. “We also have, to put it bluntly, the wrong kind of shale.” UK shales are rich in soft clays that do not support fractures well, unlike the “crispy” shale in the US. In southern England, the shale in the Weald basin is also of marine origin but formed between 200m and 145m years ago. The rocks could only produce shale oil, not gas, as they have not been buried deeply enough, and overall the British Geological Survey does not consider the basin a strong prospect. A firm figure for how much gas could be produced by fracking is unknown, and scores of wells would need to be drilled to find out. The best current estimate indicates about five years’ worth at the UK’s current usage, though some people in the industry cite a figure of 50 years. UK shale gas production would not be able to dent the global price of gas, even if thousands of wells were drilled over the next decade, and some would be likely to be exported. Most experts say increasing the energy efficiency of homes and producing more cheap wind and solar power are the fastest and most effective way to deal with the energy and climate crises. Third Energy, one the main companies that had pursued fracking, now has “absolutely no interest in fossil gas” and is targeting renewable energy and using its wells to test the burial of carbon dioxide. Another high-profile firm, Cuadrilla, will need to begin permanently sealing up its two wells in Lancashire this week to meet a legal deadline. “The inconvenient fact, like it or not, is that the UK has not discovered any good shale for onshore gas production,” said Prof Stuart Haszeldine, at the University of Edinburgh. A government spokesperson did not rule out resuming support for fracking. They said: “In light of Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine and rising global gas prices, it’s right we move away from dependence on Russian gas and increase our self-reliance in our energy security. We are considering all our options. We will set out an energy supply strategy which will supercharge our renewable energy and nuclear capacity as well as supporting our North Sea oil and gas industry.” The spokesperson said gas produced by the UK typically had a lower environmental footprint than imports of liquid natural gas from abroad.",News/Environment,Blow to fracking in England as only five of 138 MPs in target areas voice support,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/blow-to-fracking-in-england-as-only-five-of-138-mps-in-target-areas-voice-support
3/15/2022,"Didn’t you love the pictures of a column of Metropolitan police officers running towards Oleg Deripaska’s house like it was a five-storey Greggs? Here they come, trotting with intent, a phalanx of shirt-sleeved, riot-shielded protect-and-servers who may or may not be available inside of six weeks next time your house is burgled. To recap, four protesters yesterday occupied a house in London’s Belgravia that is supposedly owned by the Russian aluminium magnate Deripaska (now on the UK sanctions list). They unfurled some banners inviting Vladimir Putin to fuck himself and so on, before being removed by the largest Met police presence you’ll see outside of a women’s vigil for someone murdered by a Met police officer. Territorial support group, police negotiators, police climbers, riot police … and, my darlinks, one’s rarely seen so much hardware. The only big guns they left back at the station were the surface-to-air questionnaires. There were at least eight vans and two squad cars, as well as a JCB, for some reason not being driven by Boris Johnson. Surely the prime minister should have just piloted it through the wall of the Belgrave Square house, then emerged from the driver’s cabin for the cameras gurning GET SANCTIONS DONE? Absolutely no sense of occasion. Alas, despite all these expensive resources, the incident drew a viciously self-satirising statement from Deripaska’s spokeswoman. “We are appalled at the negligence of Britain’s justice system shown by Boris Johnson’s cabinet in introducing the sanctions and colluding with the sort of people who raid private property,” she fumed. “It’s truly a disgrace that this is happening in a country that is supposed to respect private property and the rule of law.” Now come come, madam – this isn’t a “raid on private property”. It’s a special operation. As for the response to it, that is multiples more police than anyone normal in London could ever hope for. To put it in perspective, it’s about the volume of hardcore law enforcement you could expect if a woman in Red Square held up a small piece of paper that doesn’t even say “no war”, but simply says “two words”. But look, before we go any further, I’m not saying that the protesters don’t need to be removed from the property. Of course they do. However, as the author and kleptocracy expert Oliver Bullough remarked: “There must be 20 police officers outside the Belgrave Square property occupied by anarchists, which is I reckon approximately 20 more than ever checked the provenance of the money that bought it.” Also, not sure we can entirely get behind the spokeswoman claiming to be “appalled at the negligence of Britain’s justice system”. Join the queue. If the oligarchs have an issue with “Britain’s justice system”, perhaps they should spend less time clogging it up? Honestly, they’re never out of it, with their libel suits and their in-group spats and their full-spectrum lawfare. Still, an Englishman’s home is his castle, and an oligarch’s home is … oh, hang on. I’m just reading some more of the spokeswoman’s outpourings, and apparently this isn’t even his home. Deripaska says it is owned by “some family members”. I must say it’s really great to see Oleg supporting British investigative journalism, even with all the stuff he has going on in his life right now. Where this type of guy is concerned, it normally takes really dogged reporters a year to discover who owns the shell company that owns the shell company that owns the shell company that owns the house. Furthermore, we must thank Deripaska or Some of his Family Members for enabling another great British pastime – looking askance at what people have done to their houses. After all, we lay our scene in Belgravia, one of various areas in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea that a previous social class of occupants judge has “completely gone, I’m afraid”. Or rather, completely gorn. In many ways I’m all for a new breed of horror moving in. Ring the changes, you know? But funny to think that Deripaska’s house was once owned by politician and category-5 diarist Chips Channon, who, incidentally, was not held back by self-doubt in his interiors vision. As he wrote of a new scheme for the Belgrave Square dining room: “It will shock and stagger London.” And naturally they talked of little else in the East End. Anyway, Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson came to dinner there one night in 1936 and, according to Channon, “The doors were flung open … and there was a pause as everyone’s breath was taken away by the beauty of the dining room.” Flash forward to 2022, and my breath was also taken away by the video shot yesterday by the protesters from inside the historic house. Blond wood floors and a glass banister? Literally worse than the abdication. The occupiers were eventually arrested, despite attempts to settle in for longer. According to reports, when they caught sight of some people looking out of the windows of the next-door house, one called over: “We are your new neighbours. We’ll come over tomorrow with some brisket.” (Brisket! A slightly surreal detail. Isn’t the offering cliche a cup of sugar – or, in this locale, a cup of green juice? Perhaps the protester is American. Like Chips Channon.) As for the Met, this is without question another great look from its spring collection, fresh off being found last week to have breached the rights of the organisers of the Sarah Everard vigil. Winter, meanwhile, was enlivened by its declaration that it does not investigate “historical crimes”. Maybe yesterday’s alleged crime found itself in a liminal time zone – it was not technically historical, being ongoing, and therefore could be investigated by as many officers as were available, minus the ones serving WhatsApp suspensions and whatnot. And yet a friend recently observed a burglary in progress, and no squad car came because of what he was told was a lack of available resource. When he followed up, he was invited to make an appointment to discuss the incident so officers could gather a statement. In the end, then, I can’t help feeling Monday’s ridiculous tableau in Belgrave Square is symbolic of a wider discombobulation, as Londongrad struggles with the pivot to this new era. A whole series of compromised institutions, from the legal profession to the police to the politicians, are going to require a significant reset if we truly do mean to stop enabling some of the worst individuals in the world at the expense of pretty much everyone else. Nothing wrong with being polite, of course. But both literally and metaphorically, we really don’t have to fall over ourselves running to assist these people.

3/15/2022,"I’m moving to a home with a small kitchen and limited storage. What’s the most essential kit?Ellie, Nottingham “Most things are frills – few are essentials,” wrote Laurie Colwin in her essay The Low-Tech Person’s Batterie de Cuisine. But even “essentials” require thought. Colwin continues: “Pans are like sweaters: you may have lots of them, but you find yourself using two or three over and over again.” As with clothing, versatility is key. For Carla Lalli Music, whose latest cookbook, That Sounds So Good, is released this month, a 25cm cast-iron skillet (or saute pan) is invaluable, “for all your pan-frying, all your searing, most stir-fries, and it goes from stovetop to oven, so you could also roast a chicken in it”. Then, you’ll want a small (about 20cm), nonstick pan and a Dutch oven (a cast-iron casserole with a lid): “I use this for much more than braises; it’s great for soups, for stews and for making pasta sauces.” Amy Poon, co-owner of Poon’s in London, meanwhile, packed her daughter off to university with a medium-sized wok with a lid and a steaming rack. Stir-frying aside, you can “batch cook bolognese and stews in it, fry bacon and eggs, steam vegetables and even make stock”. It doubles as a mixing bowl for large salads, too. Also on Poon’s kit list is a rice cooker, whether that’s for making porridge, poaching fruit or using “as traditionally intended”. A midweek staple round Poon’s is clay pot rice: “Throw everything in, press a button and get on with other business while it cooks. You can use any variety of toppings: chicken with Chinese mushrooms, pork belly and shrimp paste, or abandon Chinese flavours and use canned tomatoes and peas with bacon or sausages.” When it comes to knives, three is Lalli Music’s magic number: a serrated one for bread, a 15cm utility/veg prep knife “for smaller jobs, smaller ingredients”, and a 20-25cm chef’s knife (“depending on the size of your hand”). Get yourself to a decent shop and see what style takes your fancy – “You might prefer a German one or a Japanese santoku,” she says. You will also want a couple of chopping boards, a Microplane grater, and, adds Lalli Music, wooden spoons, a slotted spatula, some tongs and a mesh spider. “I probably use that every day; it’s great for moving things from one place to another – pasta, poached or boiled eggs, anything you have to drain.” Poon, meanwhile, keeps a mandoline (“for fast, uniform slicing without the bulk of a food processor”) and wooden chopsticks in her arsenal. “They’re great for mixing, stir-frying, prodding stuff to see if it’s cooked, as a trivet, to keep pot lids ajar, as a rest inside a steamer to stack dishes on and, of course, to eat with.” Measuring spoons, scales, mixing bowls and a cake tin or two are also useful things, but when space is at a premium, it’s worth thinking about what you cook and to equip yourself accordingly. Case in point: when chef Ivan Tisdall-Downes opened Native in London, his blowtorch was invaluable for getting those charred, smoky flavours without a barbecue or grill. “It’s great for cooking vegetables and getting a crisp topping on lasagne or cottage pie.” After all, that’s the best bit.

3/15/2022,"Look at the map of onshore exploration licences in the UK, and you could be forgiven for thinking it was an illustration of target seats for opposition parties in the next general election. Ministers privately acknowledge that “rethinking” fracking would be politically very difficult. Those areas most ripe for the controversial oil and gas extraction method are marginals in the “red wall” of constituencies in the north that historically have tended to be Labour, many of which were won by the Tories in 2019. Many of the others are former safe Conservative seats in the south where the Liberal Democrats are limbering up to pick off disillusioned former Tory voters. When asked if they would support fracking in their constituencies, only five of the 138 MPs whose areas contained onshore exploration licences said they would, with 41 opposed. The remainder either did not reply or declined to comment. Even those Conservatives who make positive noises about restarting fracking in principle are wary about saying they would like it in their area. Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP for Thirsk and Malton, has been full-throated in his support for fracking. However, when approached about whether he supported drilling in his constituency, he seemed more lukewarm on the issue. “I have long been an advocate for producing our own gas rather than importing it,” he said. “I am supportive of fracking if it is safe. However, it is an intense and slow process due to the number of well sites that are required and there have been induced seismicity issues when this was tried previously. Resuming fracking would not solve the immediate crisis as it would take at least 10 years to produce the quantities of gas required to meet our needs.” Similarly, Nigel Mills, the Conservative MP for the Amber Valley in Derbyshire, has said fracking could be good for the UK’s energy independence but he did not support it in his constituency. He said: “Fracking should only take place away from where people live and so there are no suitable sites in Amber Valley.” Even MPs in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group have reservations about fracking in their areas. The MP for Blackpool South, Scott Benton, has said he would be reluctant to allow fracking in his constituency because of the earthquakes it had caused in the past. Joe Twyman, founder of the polling company Deltapoll, said this attitude tracked his research on public opinion about fracking. The most recent surveys on the issue, he said, showed that while people were often positive about the principle of fracking, they did not want it happening in their area. Twyman said intense arguments about infrastructure could often have a large impact locally, and that could cost the Conservatives seats. “As we have seen with HS2, important local factors that are sometimes unique to a constituency, can have a significant impact on voting. Fracking is the kind of issue that has the potential to have a similar impact, if not larger. Consistently a majority of the British public have been opposed to the idea of fracking in their local area and it is unlikely that recent developments around energy security will change that,” Twyman said. The Labour party has already seized on worries over the government’s potential U-turn on fracking, releasing their own energy plan which is focused on renewables, and emphatically rejecting the idea of onshore drilling. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero minister, said: “Fracking is the wrong choice for Doncaster and it is the wrong choice for our country. It is unsafe, expensive, and does not command public support. Instead, we need a clean energy sprint, by accelerating homegrown renewable and nuclear energy – the cleaner, cheaper choice. “Labour has a plan to expand wind, solar, and wave power, as well as a home insulation plan to bring down energy bills. This is the best route to tackle the climate crisis, the cost of living crisis, and our energy security crisis together. We need a clean energy sprint for national energy independence and sovereignty.” In the south, the Lib Dems came second to the Conservatives in many seats in areas with onshore exploration licences, including West Dorset, Mid Sussex, and Guildford. Local infrastructure concerns, such as HS2 and the government’s plans to relax planning laws to make it easier to build homes, have cost the Conservatives dearly in many southern constituencies. Political campaigners in these areas seem aware that another shock to the Conservatives such as last year’s Chesham and Amersham byelection could be in store if shale drilling were allowed to take place in these constituencies. At the time, the Lib Dems acknowledged that local anger over planning laws was a driving factor in their winning the previously safe Conservative seat. But despite all this, the culture war is likely to rumble on, not least as there is a small but vocal group of backbenchers determined to have the argument on fracking. One such MP is Christopher Chope. Perhaps put at ease by his majority of nearly 24,000, he has said he would support fracking in his constituency of Christchurch in Dorset. Chope, who represents a seaside constituency with one of the most elderly electorates in the UK, said: “I am a strong advocate of the UK maximising its own energy resources to reduce dependency on foreign imports. This would be of enormous benefit to my constituents in the battle against rising energy costs in both the long and short term.” However, even he added the careful caveat: “There should be no exceptions, but all new developments should be subject to planning permission.”",News/Environment,Tory MPs in target seats fear political impact of fracking,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/tory-mps-in-target-seats-fear-political-impact-of-fracking
3/15/2022,"Over more than four decades, Neil Zukerman, a New York gallery owner, and his husband, Tom Shivers, filled their Chelsea loft with paintings, books, ceramics, glassware, figurines, silk flowers and countless other treasures. “We only ever had things in our house that we loved. And if we loved it, we found a place for it,” said Shivers. But after Zukerman’s death at the age of 81 last year, Shivers decided to sell some of the couple’s extraordinary collection, including 90 works by Leonor Fini, the 20th-century artist famous for her depictions of powerful and erotic women. The first of 10 sales from the couple’s collection will take place online from Thursday, alongside an exhibition of works by Fini and other women artists at Sotheby’s London galleries. “Neil loved Fini’s art, and always said if owning one is good, owning 100 is better,” said Shivers. Fini – born in Argentina in 1907, raised in Italy and later a resident of Paris – was perhaps the most ferociously independent female artist of the 20th century, according to art historians. Although her works have been included in almost every major surrealism exhibition since the 1930s, she refused to label herself a surrealist, partly because of the misogyny of the movement’s leader, André Breton. She died in 1996. Zukerman and Fini spoke regularly by phone for two years before a face-to-face meeting in Paris in the early 1980s. “Neil learned to speak French in order to be able to converse with her. She could be incredibly kind, but she wasn’t an angel,” said Shivers “Once an artist sent her one of his paintings to critique. It was returned to the gentleman in a manila envelope, cut into pieces. She said: ‘Sorry, couldn’t find a larger envelope.’” On one occasion, while she was lunching with Pablo Picasso and the art dealer Julien Levy, the latter reached for a napkin that Picasso had doodled on. “Leonor picked up the napkin and said: ‘Oh Pablo! The same old shit.’ She tore it up and threw it into the gutter,” said Shivers. “She lived with two men for 35 years. She always said a woman should have two lovers: one for sex, and one for the emotional and intellectual.” Last year, Fini’s 1938 self-portrait, Autoportrait au scorpion, sold for $2.3m. Her paintings are in the permanent collections of the Met, Tate Modern and Centre Pompidou. Lisa Stevenson, Sotheby’s modern and contemporary specialist, said it was “tricky to confine Fini’s work to a category or a movement; she presented a new and truly modern sense of the feminine”. She added: “Fini’s work was revolutionary. She explored sexuality and interrogated and asserted the position of the woman away from the traditional role as a muse or mother. With her continuous investigation into the notions of female identity, and her rejection of the rational, it is natural that Fini found herself so closely linked to the surrealist movement. But her relationship to the surrealist artists was a complex one. “Over the past decade we have seen women that were historically considered on the sidelines of the surrealist movement being rightly cultivated as serious and significant artists.” Among the works being sold from Zukerman and Shivers’ collection is Fini’s 1975 fantastical painting Rasch Rasch Rasch … Meine Puppen Warten (Hurry, Hurry, Hurry … My Dolls Are Waiting). It depicts the artist as a child, being dressed by an adult woman while looking through a window at five partially clothed women. The series of sales also includes Fini’s many depictions of sphinxes and other figures metamorphosing into cats, birds and skeletons. But Shivers is keeping his favourite, a painting of Tristan and Isolde which hangs over the couple’s bed. “That will stay until I’m gone,” he said. The apartment, in a former industrial building, contains a “garden room” with a mosaic floor made up of 80,000 tiles, a huge collection of vintage perfume bottles taking up a bathroom wall, and a cinema room dedicated to Marilyn Monroe. Zukerman and Shivers had always intended to sell a number of works to fund their retirement. But Shivers, 79, still collects “a few bits and pieces”, and a storage room in the loft is “filled floor to ceiling” with artworks. The apartment would “never look minimalist”, he said.",Arts/Art and design,Leonor Fini works among treasures for sale from extraordinary New York home,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/15/leonor-fini-works-among-treasures-for-sale-from-extraordinary-new-york-home
3/15/2022,"A 66-year-old gun enthusiast accused of suggesting the murder of Spain’s Socialist prime minister “to force a change in the political life of the country” has told a court he was never serious about the assassination, blaming his words on too much wine, brandy and bravado. Manuel Murillo, a security guard from Terrassa in Catalonia, could face 18 and a half years in prison if convicted of proposing the murder of Pedro Sánchez and of possessing illegal weapons and ammunition. Murillo was arrested in September 2018 after police were alerted to the messages he had shared with a rightwing, nationalist WhatsApp group. He told its members he was angry about the Sánchez government’s plans to exhume General Franco from his tomb outside Madrid, saying: “We can’t let them humiliate the generalísimo … It’s their revenge for losing the [Spanish civil] war.” Murillo added: “If needs be, I’ll head off armed and I’ll sit on Franco’s tomb and shoot them if they come near me. If they touch Franco I suggest there be another war for our honour.” He later told the group that envisaged a “national uprising” to overthrow the Socialist government and said it would be a bit like Operation Valkyrie, the failed attempt to kill Hitler in 1944. “I’m a marksman and with one good shot, Sánchez is done for before all of Spain goes down,” he said. “There wouldn’t need to be any wars.” Murillo also said the prime minister should “be hunted like a deer and his head put over the mantlepiece”, adding: “So many hunters in Spain and none of them has balls. All they do is kill poor animals that don’t destroy Spain, which is why this one needs hunting.” Appearing on Tuesday at Spain’s highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, Murillo said he had been overworked and was drinking heavily at the time he sent the messages. “I felt like a hero, like Rambo, and I said things like this to save Spain,” he said. Asked about the messages threatening the life of the prime minister, the defendant said he had been drinking wine and orujo and didn’t remember sending them. “I’ve never been the kind of man to do anything,” Murillo said. “If I said it, it’s because I was daydreaming and I don’t know why I said it … I was living alone and I was having a tough time with the loneliness, and we joked about it [in the WhatsApp group] … “I never really intended to do it and I don’t know what was going through my mind as I’m not a killer. But I might have said it because I was drunk. All this is because I was drunk.
