5/13/2022,"With just over a week until polling day in the federal election, people are still searching Google for the answer to questions such as “which party is ScoMo in?” and “who should I vote for?”. In week five of the campaign, the top breakout search according to trend data provided by Google is the one on everyone’s mind: “Who is winning?” But during Sunday’s debate on Channel Nine, people were also asking what party Morrison is in, when he became prime minister and “how do you define a woman, ScoMo?”. Search interest in “Scott Morrison transgender” has tripled in the past seven days, as the prime minister backed in the Warringah Liberal candidate, Katherine Deves, over her retracted apology for offensive comments about transgender children. Dr Glenn Kefford, a lecturer in political science at the University of Queensland, said many voters only paid close attention to politics around key moments in the electoral cycle. “As the polls are now open, this is the time that voters are starting to think seriously about their decision,” Kefford said. “The decisions that voters make are often guided by partisan leanings as well as perceptions of political leaders.” He said people may have been searching for what party Morrison is in because he “is one of the more polarising figures in Australian federal politics in recent years and it appears that many voters have made their minds up about him”. “Searching for ‘what party ScoMo is in’, suggests voters want to know that information to know who to vote or not to vote for,” he said. The top trending questions on Anthony Albanese were what school he went to, where he was on a given day, and how to pronounce his name. (He used to rhyme it with ease, but now rhymes it with easy.) As prepolling opened on Monday, people began searching for their nearest booth, as well as “reasons to vote early”. That search more than tripled in the past week, although in South Australia and Western Australia people were still searching more for postal voting than prepoll voting places. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning People were also searching for information about what a donkey vote is and whether it counts as a vote. A donkey vote is where people number the candidates from top to bottom (or vice versa) in numerical order. It counts as a valid vote. It is different from an informal vote, which means the ballot was not marked or was not marked correctly. Kefford said people searching for donkey voting could mean voters were dissatisfied with the options, or just generally trying to understand how voting worked. “I think that’s a good thing,” he said. Over the past few weeks the top search result has been ABC’s Vote Compass. Kefford said the search shows many voters are undecided, as indicated by the polls. “What we know from the political science literature is that some of these voters will probably still return to one of the major parties, while others are open to alternatives we are seeing emerge across the country,” he said. “Second, that for many voters, this election may be decided on how they view Morrison.” Perhaps owing to a number of stories about corflutes being vandalised, or pulled down – or, in Goldstein, subject to a legal battle – searches related to corflutes have almost doubled since the 2016 election, with the top search being “what is a corflute”. Searches are also looking to possible post-election scenarios, including how a hung parliament would work.",News/Australia news,What party is ScoMo in? What is a corflute?

5/13/2022,"A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial of the invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, a commander in Russia’s Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of shooting dead an unarmed man, 62, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone in the village of Chupakhivka, Sumy. Shysimarin was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The Russian foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession, after Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, said it must apply to join the military alliance “without delay”. Sweden is expected to follow within days. Russia could cut its gas supplies to Finland on Friday, a day after Finnish leaders said they would apply to join Nato, according to reports. The Republican senator Rand Paul has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill for Ukraine in the US Senate. Paul demanded changes including an inspector general to oversee how it is spent. Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that “at least several thousand Ukrainians” have been sent to so-called “filtration centres” in Russia where they are subject to “brutal interrogations”. Tens of thousands more had been evacuated to Russia or Russia-controlled territory. Carpenter said that one survivor said “everyone was afraid to be taken to Donetsk”, where they could be the victim of “further investigation or murder”. Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, including by trying to open routes through Romania and the Baltic, are being discussed at a three-day meeting of G7 foreign and agriculture ministers in Germany. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine – enough to feed 400 million people – was exported through its seven Black Sea ports. Ukraine said it had damaged and set on fire a Russian navy logistics ship in the Black Sea. The Vsevolod Bobrov was near Snake Island, said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration in southern Ukraine. The Guardian could not independently verify the details and Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said “very difficult negotiations” were ongoing to evacuate 38 seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. “We work step by step,’” he said. “We will exchange 38, then we will move on.” The number of people who have fled Ukraine to escape Russia’s invasion has exceeded six million, the UN’s refugee agency has said. A further eight million people have been displaced inside Ukraine. Nearly 100 children were killed in Ukraine during April alone but actual figures could be significantly higher, the United Nations children’s fund has said. Unicef’s deputy executive director, Omar Abdi, demanded an end to the bombing of Ukrainian schools, adding that one in six Unicef-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been “damaged or destroyed” as of last week. European Union leaders plan to assess Ukraine’s membership next month, according to the French foreign ministry. The UN’s human rights council has passed a resolution to investigate alleged abuses by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine formerly under their control, with a view to holding those responsible to account. The resolution passed by a strong majority, with 33 members voting in favour and two – China and Eritrea – against. There were 12 abstentions. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said 1,000 bodies had been recovered in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in recent weeks.

5/13/2022,"As a magician’s audience suspends its disbelief, in Australia’s parliament you aren’t allowed to call someone a liar. But in the real world people say it out loud; they don’t trust politicians. That’s depressing, particularly in the middle of an election campaign when voters are about to exercise their democratic right. Aristotle had his doubts about democracy. He knew persuasion – the language of our politics – has a much lower evidence bar than the rigorous logic used in science; you can persuade people merely by “seeming to prove” a truth. Fast-forward to the US political strategist James Carville’s boast: “Truth is what you can make the voter think it is.” We’re getting better at recognising the bald-faced lie – the one that instantly fails the pub test. But other ways of tinkering with the truth are harder to spot. Cue fallacies: believable arguments based on false reasoning. Some politicians use fallacies all the time, all use them some of the time: to deflect and distract and to win arguments, rather than deal head-on with difficult policy issues. Here are seven fallacies (a far from exhaustive list) to watch out for. The strawman strategy is to set up a distorted, easily refuted, version of your opponent’s position and attack that instead. So Labor is soft on China, says the Coalition when it’s criticised over the Solomon Islands deal. And a policy debate with a teal independent turns instead to their links to Simon Holmes à Court. In both cases the strawman argument is set up to deflect. The converse is steelmanning: dealing directly with the issue, even helping your opponent build their best argument, and then demolishing that. It’s the soundest way to argue if you really want to come up with a constructive solution to a problem (and if you manage to find a politician who prefers to steelman, vote for them quickly before they change their mind!). The London mayor Boris Johnson was upfront about using the “after this, therefore because of this” fallacy when discussing the effects of the city’s hosting of the 2012 Olympic Games: “Post hoc ergo propter hoc – we’ve won the cricket, the rugby and qualified for the World Cup. Can I claim them as an Olympic benefit? I don’t know, but I’m going to try.” Political parties take credit for anything positive that happens on their watch and slam others for anything negative that happens on theirs. So the Coalition takes credit for low unemployment and is blamed by the opposition for the rise in inflation and interest rates. But correlation doesn’t equal causation. If a politician says you’re either with them or against them, don’t take the bait. They’re painting a situation in black and white when there are many shades of grey: think pandemic policy framed in zero-sum terms as a choice between health and the economy, or the claim climate change action will necessarily hurt jobs. (The already mentioned Solomon Islands strawman does double time as a false dilemma). Such framing oversimplifies complex issues into two mutually exclusive choices, when there are actually many possible policy responses. This type of argument has been employed in debates on assisted dying and asylum seeker policy. It posits a certain course of action will lead to a (hypothetical) extreme result, and it’s often accompanied by an appeal to fear (see below) rather than evidence. Labor has used this strategy to claim the Coalition will expand the cashless welfare card to pensioners. And both sides of the federal integrity commission debate have employed the slippery slope fallacy – one to argue about the danger to our democracy if politicians aren’t held accountable, and the other to warn of the threat posed by “kangaroo courts”. Scare campaigns have worked before – Mediscare in 2016 and “death taxes” in 2019 – and may again. We’ve heard this time that Labor’s changes to the safeguard mechanism will be a carbon tax by stealth, that the independents are threats to national security, and again that the Coalition will weaken Medicare. Even without evidence, such claims fall on receptive ears. Voters are susceptible to fears that play into stereotypes. If the Coalition is viewed as stronger on the economy and security and Labor is trusted more on health and education, arguments that fit into those biases are an easy sell. Selectively using data that supports your proposition – and ignoring what doesn’t. Examples are the claim by the Coalition that Australia’s carbon emissions have fallen by 20% and Labor’s assertion that Australia’s debt is higher than it has ever been. Both claims are disingenuous, as they omit to mention critical caveats about the data. Targeting Scott Morrison’s religion, calling the Greens “woke warriors” and independent candidates “anti-Liberal groupies” or suggesting Anthony Albanese is hypocritical to own an investment property are all ad hominem attacks on a person or group, rather than the argument they are putting forward. So is calling the Guardian “a trashy publication”. It’s a lazy distraction, and mean-spirited. Such fallacious arguments only weaken political debate. But much of the time they go unnoticed, and are likely to fall under the radar of any official truth-in-advertising or integrity accounting. The only thing a voter can do is learn to recognise them and avoid falling for them. You might not be able to keep the bastards completely honest – but at least you won’t be taken for a mug.

5/13/2022,"One of the stranger stories in this campaign has been the travails of Alan Tudge – Schrödinger’s minister – a person both in and out of Scott Morrison’s cabinet. Also strange: what the government has said at various times about the events that have contributed to this unusual state affairs. To help cut through the confusion, and in the interests of transparency, let’s work through this saga, step by step. Last year, the prime minister faced pressure to do something about Tudge. His former staffer Rachelle Miller alleged in December that Tudge had been emotionally and, in one instance, physically abusive towards her during a personal and professional relationship. Tudge denied Miller’s allegations and went to the backbench. Morrison then appointed the distinguished former bureaucrat Vivienne Thom to investigate whether or not there had been any breach of his ministerial standards. After an inquiry, Thom said there wasn’t “a basis for a finding that Mr Tudge’s conduct breached the ministerial standards”. There were two footnotes. “The evidence available to the inquiry was limited by Ms Miller’s decision not to participate,” Thom wrote, and the ministerial standards “do not specifically address broader integrity and conflict of interest issues that can be a consequence of relationships that do not amount to ongoing or family relationships”. No. Separately to the issues canvassed by Thom, in November 2020, Miller filed a workplace harassment lawsuit seeking compensation for her treatment while a Liberal party staffer, including allegedly being belittled in Tudge’s office and deprived of further career progression after she was shuffled into the office of then employment minister Michaelia Cash. This legal action is against the Department of Finance, which is technically the employer of ministerial staff. There has been an attempt to mediate and reach a settlement, and press reports have pointed to the potential for Miller to receive a taxpayer-funded compensation payment of at least $500,000, plus legal costs. But the process has stalled. Back in April, Morrison told 2GB he had no “visibility” on that workplace action. “Those are private matters between the department of finance and Ms Miller, and they’re appropriately at arm’s length from me,” he said. Morrison said the “rules” meant he wasn’t “allowed to have visibility or any participation in that, because it’s an employment matter, and no one can confirm these issues”. In mid-April, the Coalition’s campaign spokesperson Anne Ruston said the workplace action was “not related to the issues that were the subject of the Thom inquiry, which found Mr Tudge had not breached ministerial standards. My understanding is it’s a separate matter that’s being handled by the Department of Finance and you’ll need to direct your questions to them”. Finance at that time declined to engage with specifics, saying it did not comment “on the details of any individual claim.” But by Wednesday night, Morrison did have information. During the final leaders’ debate of the campaign, the prime minister was asked by the Seven Network’s political editor Mark Riley “don’t taxpayers have a right to know why they have paid half a million dollars compensation to your education minister, Alan Tudge’s press secretary and former lover?” Morrison said: “I’m advised [this action] has not even been settled. That’s because these are matters to go to very private interactions between people and they are handled sensitively.” After he shared this information about the workplace matter, which is ongoing and unresolved, Morrison flipped back to the concluded Thom inquiry. “We had an independent inquiry into Alan Tudge,” Morrison said. “I had an independent inquiry. We dealt with the issue”. Then a little later in the debate, Morrison veered back to the workplace action. “On the other matter of the financial settlement, I’m advised that the matter hasn’t even been settled.” Asked earlier this week why the Department of Finance was negotiating with Miller to receive a payment in excess of $500,000, Tudge said: “As the prime minister said, he’s unaware, I’m unaware. It’s a matter for the Department of Finance”. “I have no information. I haven’t been called as a witness. I haven’t been asked to provide evidence and as the prime minister said, if it involved me, he would have been made aware and he hasn’t been made aware.” Given the broad allegations levelled in Miller’s workplace claim have been reported publicly and widely in a number of media outlets, it is odd for Tudge to say he has no information. Presumably he means he hasn’t been formally engaged as part of any legal action. Miller has been engaged in mediation with the Department of Finance – technically her former employer. She may yet launch a legal action that ventilates specific allegations against Tudge and Cash, but that hasn’t happened as yet. While the government has said for several weeks either it hasn’t been briefed, or it would be inappropriate to respond in detail to questions about this action, Miller said in mid-April she was happy to release the commonwealth, the finance department and the prime minister from “any obligation of confidentiality in respect of her claim”. Often the settlement of such claims include non-disclosure agreements. Miller has made it clear she isn’t interested in a settlement on those terms. Morrison was asked on the hustings on Thursday whether he stood by a previous statement that the $500,000-plus compensation claim did not involve Tudge. He was asked: “If the Cabinet minister was involved in such a claim, you would be told?” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The prime minister said “that was the advice that I received from the secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet”. Morrison was then asked whether or not he was being briefed on the contents of the claim. “Well, I can’t be,” he said. It was pointed out to the prime minister that a 22-page letter sent to the Department of Finance outlined specific allegations against the two ministers Miller worked for – Tudge and Cash. “I can’t be briefed on that,” Morrison said. “My only advice was that it hadn’t been settled. That was my last advice.” Morrison then said something quite specific. He said if there was any matter “that went to the conduct of any minister, any minister at all, that related to the ministry or standards – then I would be advised of that”. Having made that observation, Morrison then segued to the concluded Thom inquiry, which is different to the unconcluded workplace matter against the Department of Finance. But the prime minister seemed to conflate the two processes. “We had an independent inquiry into those matters and that independent inquiry did not find any basis for any action in relation to the ministerial standards,” he said. Apart from ongoing confusion and a significant lack of transparency, it is not yet clear how this story ends. Miller may settle her claim successfully, or she may take it to the courts.",News/Australia news,"Alan Tudge, Scott Morrison and who knows what about Rachelle Miller’s reported $500,00 payout",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/alan-tudge-scott-morrison-and-who-knows-what-about-rachelle-millers-reported-50000-payout
5/13/2022,"Liverpool’s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple have taken several knocks in the past week, but they can significantly reduce the odds against them notching up a pretty decent treble with a win against Chelsea in the FA Cup final. Their chances would have been greatly increased had Fabinho been available but the Brazilian limped out of their win over Aston Villa with a soft tissue injury after 30 minutes and Liverpool immediately looked far more vulnerable. He’s not expected to be back until the Champions League final. A vital presence in Liverpool’s midfield, Chelsea’s forwards will seriously fancy their chances of breaching Liverpool’s rearguard with the usual sentry not in front of it on patrol. BG Chelsea v Liverpool, FA Cup final, Saturday 4.45pm Back in form with three goals in his past two games, Romelu Lukaku has given Thomas Tuchel plenty to think about ahead of the Cup final. While it is hardly the most scientific approach to team selection, Chelsea’s manager might want to bear in mind that Lukaku’s record against Saturday’s opponents is really not very good. In 19 appearances against Liverpool during his time at West Brom, Everton and Chelsea, he has only scored five goals and finished on the winning side three times. It is a record that is unlikely to inspire much in the way of confidence when the big decision is made. BG Chelsea v Liverpool, FA Cup final, Saturday 4.45pm “You offer us seven points from Chelsea, Leicester and Watford, we bite your hand off,” Frank Lampard said following Wednesday’s stalemate at Vicarage Road. The mood is upbeat, and encouragingly they have two games to come at Goodison Park against sides who are comfortable in mid-table. It’s perhaps inaccurate to say Thomas Frank’s men have “nothing to play for” but the challenge will surely be less determined than Everton would get from a side fighting for survival, or scrapping for Champions League qualification. On which note, Lampard must regard it as highly unlikely that they could go to Arsenal and win a week on Sunday. So in one sense Everton have two games to save themselves, starting with Brentford this Sunday and followed by Crystal Palace four days later. Two winnable matches – Premier League safety before the final day? Everton fans would bite your hand off. LM Everton v Brentford, Premier League, Sunday 4.30pm The capture of Erling Haaland is an ominous sign for Manchester City’s rivals and the same would be true should Declan Rice head for the Etihad from the London Stadium. Arguably neither player feels like an entirely natural fit for City – Haaland’s outrageous game has traditionally been about using his pace to get in behind defences rather than being a link in the chain of a possession-heavy side. Rice, meanwhile, lacks the silkiness of many recent Manchester City midfielders but, in theory at least, would bring the sort of defensive ballast that comes in handy while trying to win on multiple fronts. Manchester City have hammered in 10 goals in two matches since that painful Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid – and 19 in their previous four league games. Even Rice’s dynamism in front of the West Ham defence seems unlikely to stop Pep Guardiola’s goal machine. LM West Ham v Manchester City, Premier League, Sunday 2pm Tottenham Hotspur host Burnley in Sunday’s midday kick-off, a match of of massive importance for both sides. Burnley fans who cannot afford to an overnight stay in London but wish to travel by rail on the day will arrive in London mid-way through half-time if they take the first available train from Manchester Road Station on Sunday morning and it arrives on time. BT Sport’s decision, taken in conjunction with the Premier League, to stage a noon kick-off for a match of such significance provides the latest in a long line of examples which showcase the almost total disregard and borderline contempt which broadcasters and the Premier League continue to show for match-going fans. BG Tottenham v Burnley, Premier League, Sunday 12pm Leeds had Luke Ayling sent off in the 2-1 defeat by Arsenal and Dan James was shown a red card after 24 minutes in their latest loss, Wednesday’s 3-0 reverse against Chelsea. They are not doing themselves many favours and if they are ultimately relegated those dismissals may be thought of as pivotal. But Jesse Marsch’s approach in the coming days will be the most significant factor. The feeling among some fans is that he is overly conservative - predictable given he replaced the more attack-minded (some say reckless) Marcelo Bielsa – but Chelsea had looked uncharacteristically vulnerable in recent weeks. Perhaps an opportunity was missed to put Thomas Tuchel’s men under pressure. It is safe to presume that inspirational quotes from Mahatma Gandhi and Muhammad Ali are not going to hold much sway with your average Premier League footballer. But could channelling Bielsa, and recognising that attack is often the best form of defence, deliver a priceless three points? LM Leeds v Brighton, Premier League, Sunday 2pm One of the few Watford players who can finish the season with his head held high, Ben Foster cut loose at his teammates after the club’s relegation was confirmed last weekend. “We’ve got too many players who are happy to put it in for an hour, 70 minutes, but then probably fall off and happily let it go in the last 20 minutes,” he said. “You can’t have that. When you’re a team like us, the minimum is giving it everything you’ve got.” While Foster is too old and near the end of his contract to care about hurting the feelings of his fellow players with his justified criticism, they managed to rouse themselves enough to take a point from their dire midweek game against Everton. On Sunday they host Leicester as they bid to arrest a run of 12 games – 11 consecutive defeats and a draw – without a win at home. Whatever the outcome, Foster deserves an ovation, as he has previously said he’d like to finish his career in America, so this may well be his final game at Vicarage Road. BG Watford v Leicester, Premier League, Sunday 2pm With little at stake for either side as Aston Villa host Crystal Palace, Patrick Vieira has said he will use the run-in to start building for next season by giving some youngsters some top-flight experience. At the start of the campaign, Palace owner Simon Parish named David Omilabu, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi and Malachi Boateng as the trio of academy graduates most likely to break into the first team this season, but only midfielder Rak-Sakyi has got a solitary 14-minute run out. Fitness permitting, Eagles fans might like to see more of the youngsters in Palace’s three remaining games. BG Aston Villa v Crystal Palace, Premier League, Sunday 2pm “We’re a team that’s been recruited to play possession-based football, but unfortunately at this level we’re coming up against teams who are going to be better than us with possession, at times.” That was Dean Smith’s honest assessment following relegated Norwich City’s latest defeat, 3-0 away against Leicester on Wednesday. Smith’s idea that Norwich, for all their ambition, simply lack the quality to play possession-focused football in the top flight was by extension a criticism of the club’s recruitment and overall strategy before his arrival last November. Presumably, though, Smith will believe they have the ability to do it in the Championship. The suggestion seems to be that he will aim to introduce a more pragmatic approach with the aim of not just returning to, but surviving in, the Premier League. LM Wolves v Norwich, Premier League, Sunday 2pm As Arsenal continue to battle for the top four, and while the relegation fight plays out a few places below them, Eddie Howe and Newcastle have the luxury of beginning to think about next season. Howe’s intelligence and his managerial skill, honed over many years on the south coast plus a brief spell at Burnley in 2011-12, have proved a perfect fit in freeing the Magpies of worries about dropping down into the Championship. With a healthy level of investment in the squad to come in the summer – Yves Bissouma of Brighton and Leeds’s Kalvin Phillips are both transfer targets – what will constitute success in the next campaign? The more upbeat Newcastle fans may even fancy that a charge for the top six is not out of the question, and a rare win against a side from the top bracket would fuel their optimism.

5/13/2022,"“I’m OK, if you’re wondering …” Of course, Chris Rock broaches right at the start of his show the incident we’re all thinking about: The Slap, as administered to Rock onstage at the Oscars by a wayward Will Smith. The disappointment – expected, but disappointing nonetheless – is that he does no more than that. “I’ll get to it at some point, on Netflix,” says the 57-year-old, and fair enough – unless you nurse any attachment to the idea of standup as an art form more fleet-footed than that. Not that The Slap’s spectre can be easily exorcised, mind you. At least one joke in the show gains added potency in light of that recent dust-up. I’m thinking of Rock’s attack on the snowflake spirit of the age (a favoured topic among wealthy-middle-aged comedians), when he jokes that “anyone who ever said ‘words hurt’ has never been punched in the face”. No doubting here that Rock knows whereof he speaks. But for the most part, this show snapshots Rock’s thinking before Will Smith’s handprint was impressed on his face. At its best, it finds our host taking the temperature of an America he describes as near-destroyed, its Republican party lost to lies, its Democrats very selective with the truth. So “who is responsible for the downfall of America?” he asks. The answer will surprise and amuse – and beyond that, there’s droll material on the Capitol riots (“what kind of white, Planet of the Apes bullshit is that?!”), Joe Biden (back from the dead to save the country) and the iniquities of woke corporate virtue-signalling. Sometimes, in the philosophising that tees up the gags, if not in the gags themselves, there’s overreach. One marvels at Rock’s suggestion that, had a global crisis not come along, Donald Trump might have governed America perfectly well. And it’s hard to love the conclusion he reaches, for comic effect or otherwise, after surveying his country’s experience of Covid-19, which is that “people are pieces of shit”. It’s probably just as well that this is when Rock pivots, as his recent live shows usually do, to more domestic material – even if his family and dating shtick is less compelling than the social and political commentary that precedes it. It kicks off with a routine on bringing up rich kids as a man who “identifies as poor”. He can be amusingly unsentimental about his spoilt eldest daughter, but the section’s closer, about her expulsion from school, isn’t strong, and finds Rock engaging in some virtue-signalling himself. That routine, and others in the second half, loudly advertise Rock’s streak of devilry, as he plays with our expectations of his stance on abortion, and tries to justify why men apparently all want to date younger women. (An earlier Meghan Markle routine is equally – gleefully – contentious.) As ever, your enjoyment of Rock’s battle-of-the-sexes material will depend on your stomach for his assumption that men are all after “pussy”, women are all after money, and cleaning the pillowcases is a woman’s work. Sample line: “Money does for men what women think plastic surgery does for them,” the teasing spirit and retro premise of which is representative of this final quarter of the show. There are still great jokes here, including a fine one about classifying neighbourhoods by who’s visibly idle at any given time of day. And even the weak material is elevated by Rock’s expressive voice, all those sonorous repetitions and high-pitched “goddams!” to accentuate his dismay. One might wish The Slap has been addressed not glossed, and lament the old-school sexual politics. But this new tour still finds Rock on fine form. Whatever else it was, The Slap clearly wasn’t a knockout. Chris Rock appears at Birmingham Arena on Friday 13 May, then touring.
