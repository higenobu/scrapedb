2/27/2022,"The New York state legislature is debating between two bills that decriminalize sex work. The bills agree on the need to decriminalize sex workers but offer very different approaches for doing so. The Stop Violence in the Sex Trades Act seeks to fully legalize the sex trade. The Sex Trade Survivors Justice and Equality Act, which is adapted from the Nordic model, would decriminalize sex workers while keeping in place laws penalizing pimps and clients. In an odd twist, the first bill, which takes a libertarian and free-market approach to sex work, is supported by leftwing groups including the Democratic Socialists of America. Sex trafficking survivor groups, political moderates and prosecutors have mostly supported the more cautious, regulated approach. I believe advocates for both bills want the best for sex workers. But the first approach – a blanket decriminalization of sex work, including of pimps and johns – may make sex workers less safe, not more. No one disputes that sex workers face serious and constant risk of violence, and that the status quo is unsustainable and unjust. Since sex work is illegal in all states except Nevada, sex workers – who are at high risk of violence by clients, pimps and the police – generally have no way to organize for better labor protections, or to report violence without risking incrimination. In other countries, decriminalizing sex workers has made them safer. Studies of Sweden and Northern Ireland found that even partial decriminalization reduced street prostitution, lowering client violence. Decriminalization also aims to break the vicious cycle of police violence, incarceration and deportation. “I have so many issues with the vice squad,” New York state senator Jessica Ramos, who co-sponsored the Stop Violence bill for full decriminalization, told me. She accuses the police of either doing too much or too little. When a Queens vice squad raided a Flushing massage parlor in 2017, a worker fell off a second-floor balcony and died. In 2018, police officers across New York, including members of a vice squad in southern Brooklyn, were arrested for providing protection for a sex trafficking ring. The ring operated across boroughs – including in the district Ramos represents, where mostly Latina sex workers, some of them undocumented immigrants, walk the streets. “People who are most often targeted for police harassment or arrests or for violence – due to or related to sex work – are women, poor people, people of color, immigrants and trans people,” Mark Mishler, the legislative director for New York state senator Julia Salazar, who sponsored the Stop Violence bill, told me. There’s some evidence that arrests of sex workers in New York might already be decreasing on their own. The NYPD cites an overall decline in prostitution-related arrests (including of buyers and pimps as well as workers) in recent years. Arrests went from 1,069 in 2019 down to 193 in 2021. In an emailed statement, an NYPD spokesperson told me, “The NYPD’s enforcement priorities shifted in early 2017, and have continued, leading to fewer arrests over recent years of sex workers for prostitution and a greater share of arrests of those who buy sex and promote sex for sale.” Nevertheless, advocacy for full decriminalization has conjoined itself with vast, increasing leftwing support for police abolition. Leftwing and sex workers’ groups have embraced the abortion rights slogan “My body, my choice,” readapting it to sex workers’ freedom to do whatever they choose with their bodies. Under the slogan “Sex work is work,” the DSA considers full decriminalization as “a central fight for the labor movement and for socialist feminism”. Perhaps. But a misguided legislative intervention can hurt more than help. In 2018, for example, Congress passed Fosta/Sesta, a law that banned online sex ads – inadvertently flushing more sex workers out into the streets, where rushed negotiations put them at even greater risk of client-perpetrated violence. The movement for full decriminalization is anti-discrimination, anti-carceral and anti-police. But what do its arguments have to say about the concrete reality of sex trafficking? The Stop Violence bill might be more ideologically photogenic, but its opponents worry that full decriminalization might provide loopholes – or a carte blanche – for sex trafficking, a prospect that supporters of the Stop Violence bill don’t seem to acknowledge. Alexi Meyers, a former prosecutor and a consultant for the partial decriminalization bill, told me that if the Stop Violence bill repeals a statute criminalizing “promoting prostitution” (which refers to pimps) at the felony level, it would take away “the bread and butter of trafficking cases”. In New York, sex trafficking laws look for material force – like drug use, physical violence, kidnapping by withholding someone’s passport, or the destruction of property – as evidence of sex trafficking. But force is often psychological, with consent manufactured. Cristian Eduardo, a Mexican immigrant and sex trafficking survivor, told me that his traffickers often made him believe that he was choosing the life. This was in 2015, when he lived in an apartment in Queens operated by traffickers who gave him food, housing and vital HIV medication – which they convinced him he couldn’t get elsewhere – in exchange for sex with whichever john they assigned him. “The sex buyers are often very violent and abusive,” Eduardo said about his years in trafficking. “I never knew what was going to happen. The only thing I knew was I was going to be used as an empty vessel.” He says that if had been asked in court if he had consented to his treatment, he probably would have said yes, at the time. “I didn’t know it was exploitation, I thought it was my own fault and my own choice,” he said. Meyers, who worked on trafficking cases at the Brooklyn district attorney’s office, added, “We don’t always have victims who are cooperative with prosecutors – whether they are so highly traumatized by what they’ve been through, or whether they are terrified of their trafficker.” For this reason anti-pimping statutes are all the more important; they are a way to get traffickers off the streets without having to prove in court that their victims were definitively coerced. Yet advocates for full decriminalization often seem blithely uninterested in this dilemma. When I asked Mishler, Julia Salazar’s legislative director, about trafficked workers who might be hesitant to testify against their traffickers for fear of violence or homelessness, he said, “That’s not our problem. The law is the law.” I put the same question to Mariah Grant, the research and advocacy director of the Sex Workers Project, which supports full decriminalization. “You aren’t going to arrest your way out of this problem,” she said. “What we need is money that is being wrongfully diverted towards trafficking cases – that, in fact, are not actually trafficking, but people who are adults consenting to work in the sex trades – to be instead moved towards social services.” But this stance – “not actually trafficking” – feels like willed ignorance, ethically lazy or naive in the extreme. Yes, trafficked sex workers need social services, but they also need laws, not ideals, to protect them. You can’t girlboss your way out of trafficking. According to the New York State Interagency Task Force on Human Trafficking, there were about 1,000 confirmed victims of sex trafficking in New York between 2007 and 2019, a number that Meyers told me is probably an undercount of the actual victims. If the Stop Violence bill passed, that number could go up. One 2013 study of 150 countries showed that, on average, countries where prostitution is legal reported larger human trafficking inflows. For instance, sex trafficking in Germany declined gradually through 2001, then – after sex work was decriminalized in 2002 – began to increase again. There are persuasive advantages to full decriminalization. Sex workers would be able to unionize. Third-party workers, like those operating phone lines or client screeners, could work without fear of being prosecuted as pimps, creating a safer workplace. An increased demand of buyers, once decriminalized, would give sex workers more bargaining power. A 2007 study in New Zealand has shown that after full decriminalization, almost 65% of sex workers found it easier to refuse clients, and 57% reported improved police attitudes towards sex workers. But even as “sex work is work,” the sex trade can’t be treated like any other service industry, because most service industries aren’t inextricably entangled with violence and organized crime. Any law decriminalizing sex workers needs to address the sex trade as a whole, and prioritize the needs of the most disadvantaged. It’s possible to reduce violence against sex workers while also protecting those in trafficking; partial decriminalization would accomplish that. “It’s just so sad that people are like, yes, sex work is empowering, sex work is work,” Eduardo said. “And I’m like, You are not fighting for the vulnerable when you’re not fighting for the ones who are in need. You’re fighting to give more power to those who already have it.” Geoffrey Mak is a New York-based writer",Opinion/Opinion,New York might decriminalize sex work.

2/27/2022,"Down in the cool, dark cellar of Berry Bros & Rudd in St James’s, central London, Philip Moulin arranges some of the world’s most valuable wines on a table. This building has been the wine merchant’s HQ since the company was founded in 1698, and we are in the Holy of Holies, a cellar accessible via fingerprint scanner and several locked gates, where the “directors’ stock” is stored. On one rack lie dusty magnums of Mouton Rothschild 1982, on another a pyramid of golden Château d’Yquem Sauternes. The liquid in this room is worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not more. Or at least is, if it is what it claims to be. Moulin, a genial figure who has been into wine since he was a boy, has sometimes been called a “wine detective”. He is the quality and authentication manager at Berry Bros, who in recent years has specialised in helping to check everything the company buys is up to scratch. Berry Bros is the first British merchant to employ an authenticator; recognition that their reputation is based on trust and that fraudulent wine is a serious problem in the trade. Moulin shows me some of the dozens of ways to check a wine is real without actually tasting it: from the weight of the bottle to the level of the wine within, watermarks, paper with a unique weave, ink with special DNA, microchips in the bottle. Using a magnifying glass, he shows me micro-writing hidden within what look like lines. A UV torch reveals hidden flecks of reflective material. “There are lots of grey areas. We need to make sure that if we have any issues with something, it doesn’t come into the business,” says Moulin. “Questions do arise. There aren’t many people who can deal with it. The police have no interest.” It may be low priority for the police, but as wine has become more valuable, wine-related crime has been on the rise. Wine tends to be less well guarded than jewellery, yet it can be just as tempting a target. Last October, a bottle of Yquem worth £295,000 was among 45 bottles stolen from a resort in Spain. In 2019, thieves bored a hole into a cellar beneath a Paris restaurant and made off with €600,000 worth of wine. Merchants, châteaux, restaurants and customers are engaged in a constant battle against theft and mis-selling. While thefts attract headlines, fraud is the more pernicious problem. Wine has been mucked around with for as long as it has been drunk. Pliny the Elder complained of friends claiming to be drinking prized “Falernian wine” when he, an expert on the stuff, knew they were not. In Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, the Pardoner warns against mixed wines. In the 15th century, taverns poured from the barrel in sight of their customers so they couldn’t be accused of watering it down. In the 1480s, a German vigneron was forced to drink two bottles of his own wine as punishment for adulterating it. He died, which presumably spared him quite a headache. The diethylene glycol scandal of 1985, in which millions of gallons of Austrian wine were found to have been adulterated with an antifreeze component, set that nation’s wine business back a decade. After the 2004 wine film Sideways popularised pinot noir at the expense of merlot, the American firm E&J Gallo bought 13.5m litres of pinot noir from a collective of French growers in Limoux, in the Languedoc, at a surprisingly good price. Eventually, the French customs office took an interest, noting that the entire Languedoc region only produced around 5m litres of pinot noir per year. The suppliers had been sending merlot and shiraz instead. As the defence lawyers tried to argue, “not a single American consumer complained”. Today, it has been estimated that as much as 25% of all the wine in the world is not as it is described. This covers a spectrum of adulteration to bottle and liquid, from mislabelling, mis-blending and false certification to forgery. Although wine is often compared to art, a painting is either by the artist or it isn’t. But £1,000 bottles of wine might be passed off as £10,000 bottles in auctions; Algerian wine might be passed off as French; God-knows-what might be passed off as off-licence stalwarts. Where the line is drawn between acceptable rule-bending and wanton criminality can depend on who you ask, but everyone agrees the problem is getting worse. The fake wine, beer and spirits sector is estimated to cost the UK more than £600m annually. If you were trying to think of a trade ripe for fraudsters, you would struggle to come up with one better. A cheap agricultural product becomes a luxury commodity through process, time and labelling. There is no barrier to entry for winemakers or consumers. To trade complicated financial products you need FCA qualifications. Any muggins can go online and buy or sell wine for as much as they like. Only a handful of people on earth have the palate to discern between the very best wines and even they are highly fallible. What’s more, unlike authenticating a painting, the art of testing a wine has mostly involved opening it and therefore removing most of its value. There are ways to test from outside the bottle, but they are costly and complex. The most serious cases have resulted in fines or relatively short jail sentences. Such an attractive combination draws not just opportunistic chancers, but professional criminals who have the resources to keep pace with even sophisticated anti-fraud techniques. Two high-level cases helped popularise wine fraud in the public imagination. Benjamin Wallis’s 2008 book The Billionaire’s Vinegar documented the case of the Jefferson wines. A German dealer, Hardy Rodenstock, claimed to have found, behind a bricked up-wall in Paris, bottles of 1787 Lafite allegedly intended for Thomas Jefferson, engraved with “Th. J.” Despite doubts about the wines from Jefferson scholars, Christie’s sold them at auction for world-record prices. Another collector, who had bought a bottle privately from Rodenstock before the record sale, grew suspicious and sued him. In court, a piece of evidence was the presence in the wine of high levels of carbon-14 and tritium, two isotopes that became much more prevalent in the atmosphere after the advent of nuclear weapons testing. Scientists concluded that at least some of the Jefferson wine came from 1962 or later. A German court found against Rodenstock; it was settled out of court after he appealed. A film of The Billionaire’s Vinegar is in the works, with Brad Pitt attached. Then there was the case of Rudy Kurniawan, an enigmatic Indonesian who popped up in the high-end American wine market in the early 2000s with a seemingly bottomless supply of rare wines. In 2009, he was sued by Bill Koch, the billionaire collector who also helped expose Rodenstock. Koch was one of the few collectors wealthy and committed enough to risk devaluing his own collection to reveal the scams at work. When FBI investigators searched Kurniawan’s house in 2012, they found a trove of forger’s gear: corks, stamps, labels and empty bottles. In 2014 he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He served six years before being released and deported in late 2020. The scandal was the subject of a 2016 Netflix documentary, Sour Grapes. “Rudy highlighted to the whole fine wine trade that they had been complacent,” says Moulin. “Everyone had to wake up and take fraud more seriously. Now people are asking questions all the time about it: ‘How can we prove this is real?’” One of the key investigators in the Kurniawan case was Maureen Downey. A charismatic and forthright American, she is the godmother of the wine-authentication business. Working as an auctioneer in the late 90s and early 2000s, she started to notice an alarming number of fakes. Labels would be wrong; vintages impossible; the wines themselves not as described. In 2005, she quit auctions to focus on authentication. She fought an uphill battle. Owners, by and large rich and powerful men, did not want to know. There was little to be gained from being the one holding the fakes when the music stopped. Better to quietly move the wine on and let someone else take the hit. “It was a difficult decade,” says Downey, over the phone from her home in California. “I was a girl pissing on the boys’ campfire. I was out and loud about it and nobody would believe me. I had to take bodyguards to wine tastings, and I’ve been physically assaulted. It’s big money. It’s also about fragile male egos. A lot of these guys were part of a whole ‘my bottle is bigger than yours’ scene, and had been losers before they made money. It was more than they could handle to be told that their bottle was fake.” Downey agrees that the Kurniawan case changed everything. Since then, her services have been in constant demand from collectors, merchants and auction houses looking to guarantee their stock. She has trained hundreds of other experts, Moulin among them. At times, the world of elite wine crime has some of the qualities of a jewel heist; where it is tempting to root for the devious outsiders defrauding credulous billionaires. Downey has no time for this view. “As somebody who has been screaming about this for years, I needed to find a way to make people care,” she says. “There are people who think it’s all about stupid white guys. But fraud accounts for billions in lost tax revenue. It’s why schools go underfunded and potholes aren’t filled.” The scandal brought winemakers up short, too. Fiona Morrison is a Master of Wine and the co-owner, with her husband, Jacques Thienpont, of Bordeaux’s famous Pomerol estate, Le Pin. “It was one of those wine stories that overflows into everyday life,” she says. “It really made people sit up and take notice.” Quality control can be easier in theory than in practice, she says. “Watermarks and other things on the label can make it harder, but tracking the bottles is a thornier issue altogether. Ultimately, it takes a hell of a lot more manpower. The bottom line is that it depends on how many bottles you’re making.” In recent years she says there has been an increase in customers ordering direct from the château, to avoid the uncertainty of middlemen. While the top-end wines attract the most publicity, fraud is a problem at every level, down to the various local shops around Birmingham that were caught selling fraudulent Yellow Tail last year. (Unlike in California, Trading Standards were tipped off, in at least one case, by a suspicious and evidently discerning member of the public.) If a quarter of all the wine on earth is fraudulent, it’s almost certain you’ve served some at dinner parties. Joshua Castle is the head sommelier for Noble Rot, a pair of restaurants in London which also has a wine shop, a magazine and a wholesale trade business. They specialise in finding unusual bottles from all over the world, especially France, often from smaller producers. In contrast to the most famous Bordeaux and Burgundies, often little is known about these wines. “Some of these guys make very little or almost no wine,” Castle says. “They don’t reach many markets. Where is the body of authentic literature or knowledge about what makes those bottles distinctive?” So-called “unicorn” wines, he adds, where there is a hot demand for a little-known wine, which is in limited supply, would be a tempting target for forgers. “If you put a bottle of this stuff online, it’s going to go for top dollar, and the buyer might even drink it,” Castle says. “There won’t be any comparative analysis. I tasted a bottle in a restaurant the other day and it was so far off how I expected it to taste, it must have been a completely different wine.” All the same, he cautions against placing too much faith on any one tasting. “Human palates are pretty bad,” he says. “We can have strong instincts, but we can’t chemically analyse things on the palate. Ultimately, the weight of provenance relies on the bottle.” Thanks in part to the pioneering work of Downey and others like her, those in the trade now have a wider range of techniques to deter counterfeiters. As well as microchips and tracking numbers, there’s a system called Bubble Tag that puts an unmistakable pattern of air bubbles in the capsule (the protective sleeve over the cork), which matches to an image kept on stock. Perhaps most intriguingly, wine is an appealing test case for blockchains, the digital system of recording information in a way that protects it from fraud. Downey has created something called the Chai Vault, which will use the blockchain to authenticate bottles in storage. There are several other start-ups offering a similar service. “Everything has gotten worse since Rudy,” Downey says, “and the forgers have become a lot more sophisticated.” Downey’s new system can update information as the wines change hands. Provided there is confidence about the original provenance, it ought to help. “Blockchain is part of the solution,” she says. “In 50 years, when someone goes to buy that bottle, they will be able to see exactly what the ownership has been.” Even that doesn’t guarantee the wine, she says, because someone could still put a needle through the top and refill it with inferior liquid, so she also has a system with the capsule that protects the elegance of the bottle. For all the promise of technology, few think fraud will vanish any time soon. Partly it’s the ingenuity of the counterfeiters, and partly because the consumer is unable, or unwilling, to tell the difference. Back in the crepuscular glamour of the Berry Bros vaults, one of Moulin’s colleagues arrives to collect a bottle for a lunch upstairs. Amid all the money, theft, technology, rivalry, envy and recrimination of this murky trade, it is almost strange to be reminded of the only quality of wine older than fraud: it is meant to be drunk.",Lifestyle/Food,Wine crime is soaring but a new generation of tech savvy detectives is on the case,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/27/wine-crime-is-soaring-but-a-new-generation-of-tech-savvy-detectives-is-on-the-case
2/27/2022,"Britain has compiled a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs who will face sanctions over the coming weeks, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. She said there were more than 100 billionaires in Russia and that some of them would face “a rolling programme of sanctions” as officials compiled the evidence to justify their assets being frozen in the UK. “We are targeting oligarchs’ private jets, we’ll be targeting their properties, we’ll be targeting other possessions that they have,” she told Sky’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday. “There will be nowhere to hide.” Truss also said the government would be bringing forward its long-awaited economic crime bill this week to make it easier for assets to be targeted, by enforcing more transparency about ownership. The government has been criticised because so far only eight Russian oligarchs have been identified as being subject to individual UK sanctions. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, have also been sanctioned by the UK, but that announcement was seen as symbolic because neither Putin nor Lavrov are thought to have assets in Britain. Truss has said that drawing up the paperwork to justify individual sanctions is not straightforward because individuals at risk of being singled out have already contacted the Foreign Office threatening legal action against any sanctions decision. Asked on Sky if Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, was on her hit list, Truss refused to say. But she insisted that the government was determined to respond toughly to the Russian invasion of Ukraine because it believed it had not done enough in the past to confront Putin. “Frankly, over the past 15 year we haven’t done enough to stand up to Putin,” she said. “We’re now facing the reality of what that means. And that is why we are taking a much tougher stand now.” In particular, she said Britain and the west did not do enough to deter Putin in 2008, when he invaded Georgia, and in 2014, when he seized Crimea, which was part of Ukraine. In her Sky interview Truss also warned that the current conflict in Ukraine could last for “a number of years”. She said she thought it could lead eventually to the downfall of his regime, but that before then Putin could resort to using more brutal tactics and weaponry in the conflict. Without giving details, she said: “I fear this conflict could be very, very bloody.” She said: “This could well be the beginning of the end for Putin. And I fear that he is determined to use the most unsavoury means in this war.” Truss also signalled that the government was likely to ease the current restrictions on Ukrainians seeking refuge in the UK, saying an announcement about changes to visa rules was coming “very shortly”. Individuals who are subject to sanctions usually face travel bans and having their assets in the UK frozen, although the exact terms of sanctions instruments can vary. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, told the same programme that the UK sanctions had not gone far enough. He asked why there were individuals who had been sanctioned by the US but not the UK, and said: “We can’t understand why it’s still the case that there are major Russian banks that are not subject to sanctions.”",News/Politics,Liz Truss says she has ‘hit list’ of oligarchs facing UK sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/27/liz-truss-says-she-has-hit-list-of-oligarchs-facing-uk-sanctions-ukraine
2/27/2022,"The shooting of a respected volunteer during a racial justice protest in Portland, Oregon last weekend has roiled the activist community in the city, and raised fresh fears about “vigilante violence” and escalating extremism in America. Authorities on Tuesday filed murder charges against 43-year-old Benjamin Smith, who police say showed up to a protest against police violence on Saturday night, yelled at demonstrators to leave, and then shot at the group. He killed 60-year-old June Knightly and wounded four others, police say. Knightly, a longtime activist involved in racial justice protests and LGBTQ+ organizing, was known as a “peacemaker” who strived to keep people safe during protests. The night of her death she had been working as a traffic safety volunteer at a demonstration calling for justice for Amir Locke and Daunte Wright, two Black men killed by police in Minnesota. Knightly’s friends and local advocates said the violence was predictable in Portland, which has seen far-right gatherings and chaotic and sometimes violent protests in the last year. The region also has a dark history of white supremacy and racist hate crimes despite its liberal reputation. The violence against protesters also comes three months after the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, who was treated as a hero among extremist Republicans and far-right groups after he killed two men at an anti-racism demonstration in Wisconsin. Advocates warn of a growing threat that extremists – emboldened by Rittenhouse’s court victory, radicalized online, and encouraged by some Republicans – will commit more acts of violence. Smith “confronted” protesters at Portland’s Normandale Park at about 8 pm local time on Saturday, prosecutors say, “yelling at them and demanding they leave the area”. The activists told Smith to leave them alone. Instead, Smith demanded they “‘make’ him leave,” and “aggressively” approached one of them, who pushed Smith back. Moments later, he began shooting, according to court records. Knightly and four other people were hit. Knightly and three other women who were wounded were not directly part of the march, one surviving victim told the New York Times, but were helping reroute traffic. None of them were armed, she said, adding that the gunman called them “terrorists” and slurs before shooting. The shooting ended when someone shot Smith, officials said. That individual was initially arrested, but is not facing charges and was not named in the charging documents. One surviving victim was struck in the neck and is paralyzed, another was struck in the abdomen, and two others were treated at a hospital and discharged. Smith was hit in the hip and hospitalized. Kristine Christenson, Smith’s roommate, said that she and others in their apartment complex were “heartbroken,” but weren’t surprised to learn of the shooting. “[Smith’s] been talking about wanting to do something like this for a while,” she said. “As far as I’m concerned, the person who fired back on Smith saved my life.” Christenson said she had lived with Smith for seven years, but had felt increasingly threatened in recent years. “He made me extremely uncomfortable and unsafe in my own living space.” “[Smith] got angrier and more and more rightwing over the past few years,” she said in an email, adding that it appeared he had become “radicalized” and was slipping “further and further down this alt right rabbit hole”. Christenson said she tried to keep her distance, but that she overheard him listening to rightwing content, including from far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. She said Smith wore a “Kyle Rittenhouse true patriot” shirt and often talked angrily about leftwing protesters, Black Lives Matter and “antifa”, unhoused people living on the streets and Covid restrictions. The shooting sent shock waves through a city that has seen frequent protests since the George Floyd uprisings of 2020, and occasional clashes between anti-fascist activists and far-right protesters. But advocates say the response from law enforcement leaders to the shooting only exacerbated concerns. The initial statement from the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) said the shooting had stated “with a confrontation between an armed homeowner and armed protesters”. Smith was not a homeowner and had gone to the demonstration, which was down the street from his apartment. But the narrative quickly spread in national media. Portland police spokesperson Kevin Allen did not say why the original press release referred to a “homeowner”, but he said in an email that an investigation determined that was inaccurate: “The use of the term was never intended to mislead anyone.” He said there was “tremendous amount of pressure” to release information in real time and that the department strives to “always remember the victims and their loved ones” in communications. The city later updated its statement to call Smith “an armed area resident”, but to advocates the mistake was part of a pattern of city leaders and law enforcement officials misrepresenting racial justice protesters and failing to address the threats of the the far-right, advocates said. PPB critics point to a list of recent scandals: at one 2017 protest in Portland, federal officers allowed a member of a rightwing “patriot” militia-style group to help arrest an anti-fascist activist; in 2019, a lieutenant was caught exchanging friendly text messages with a rightwing leader, and later cleared of wrongdoing; in 2020, the department allegedly deployed teargas against racial justice demonstrators 300 times on 20 different days; in 2021, police leaked a false story claiming that the first Black woman to serve as a Portland city commissioner, who has been critical of the department, was a hit-and-run suspect; and earlier this year, it was revealed that Portland police training documents included a meme that mocked protesters as “dirty hippies” and celebrated using violence against them. “This is a pattern and practice of Portland police,” said Sandy Chung, executive director of the ACLU of Oregon. “This seems to be an effort by Portland police to frame the story as ‘just a confrontation’, and that somehow the people involved in providing traffic safety for the march were also culpable, when there is no evidence of that.” “This is blaming victims for the harms committed against them,” said Bobbin Singh, executive director of the Oregon Justice Resource Center, adding that the shooting was “completely predictable and inevitable”. He has since called on Portland’s mayor, Ted Wheeler, to resign and for the leadership of PPB to be dismantled. Wheeler in particular is facing intense scrutiny over comments he made in 2021 after a year of sustained protests, saying he wanted to “unmask” protesters committing vandalism and arson, and that it was time to “hurt them a little bit”. “Mayor Wheeler, the top level manager of the Portland police bureau, has not set up the systems and policies and culture where there is accountability,” Chung said, “and it means that our communities are less safe.” Teressa Raiford, executive director of Don’t Shoot Portland, a social justice group, said the rhetoric against protesters was creating an environment that enabled violence and was meant to discourage people from marching against police brutality. “It’s always denouncements of vandalism rather than denouncements of violence against people, and that hinders the progress we need to make as a society,” she said of officials’ rhetoric. After the killing, her group canceled an art gallery show and paused outreach and mutual aid efforts, such as food distribution, due to safety concerns. “We want to just keep doing the work as usual, but we need time to mourn … and we’re scared. We know that there are valid threats.” The mayor’s spokesperson referred the Guardian to Wheeler’s press conference on Tuesday, during which he was asked whether he regretted his past comments about making protesters “hurt”. He responded that he was “not referring to or advocating violence”, adding, “If I regret anything it’s that I used a statement that could be used out of context for political gain.” “We know that there are tensions with some members of the community and some do not feel comfortable talking to us,” Allen, the police spokesperson, added. “We hope that through continued dialogue, we can show that we do our work and pursue investigations without regard to political affiliation or involvement in lawful free speech activity.” It wasn’t clear if Smith had a lawyer, and he could not be reached for comment. Despite police backlash and fears of extremist violence, Knightly was dedicated to supporting racial justice movements, her friends said. “‘Service’ is the word I would use to describe her approach to the world,” said Kathleen Saadat, her longtime friend in Portland. “She was about taking care of people. She knew what it was like to not have a whole lot, so she had compassion for people.” Saadat, 81, said Knightly loved to cook – shepherd’s pie was her speciality – and leaves behind a wife and son. Knightly, also known by the nickname T-Rex, would volunteer to help with transportation for people with disabilities during protests, Raiford said: “She was a peacemaker. She would help people pull together and work through the chaos. When you’re protesting, there’s a lot of trauma. She could see when people were hurting and help them.” Chung recalled Knightly helping ensure high school students were safe as they protested campus police. Saadat said she and Knightly had long conversations about how to be most impactful with activism: “June was incredibly introspective. She didn’t just act, she thought about what she was doing.” They didn’t talk much about the dangers of protesting, but Saadat said they had a conversation acknowledging that “if you decide to get out there, you accept the fact that you might be killed”, adding, “You don’t expect it, but you accept it.”",News/US news,‘Completely predictable’: the Portland shooting and fears of escalating extremism in America,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/portland-shooting-extremism-america-predictable
2/27/2022,"Former Swiss social worker and self-taught film-maker Fred Baillif developed La Mif (the title is slang for “the fam” or family) over a period of two years with the at-risk teenage residents and care workers of a Geneva children’s home. The film’s non-professional cast play characters who, if not specifically based on themselves, are rooted in their shared stories and experiences. The result is remarkable: powered by skittering, unpredictable energy and adolescent emotional eruptions, it’s a smartly structured portrait of a de facto family unit, and the tensions that tear through it. With projects born out of the cross-pollination between real life and fiction – other examples include Laurent Cantet’s Palme d’Or-winning The Class and Sarah Gavron’s vibrant, vital Rocks – there’s always the risk that the creative methodology turns out to be more interesting than the finished film; that good intentions are sunk by declamatory acting and issue box-ticking. Fortunately, La Mif holds up impressively, driven by performances that are, at minimum, solid, and at best genuinely exceptional. Standouts include Claudia Grob as veteran care manager Lora, returning to work after personal trauma, and Kassia Da Costa as Novinha, neglected by her mother and consumed by an emotion she can’t quite name – perhaps rage, perhaps a soul-sick sadness. Mini-chapters focus on characters in turn, each offering a new perspective on the unfolding drama; choral and chamber music is an unexpected but effective punctuation in the storytelling, but most powerful is sound design that understands the gravity of moments of weighted silence.",Arts/Film,La Mif review – remarkable teenage care home drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/27/la-mif-review-fred-baillif-remarkable-teenage-care-home-drama
2/27/2022,"To the political right in America, Joe Biden’s son Hunter has been the gift that keeps on giving, with his public struggles with addiction, scandalous private life and tangled business life. To the left, Hunter’s travails are dismissed as a Republican political obsession and a talking point for tabloid journalism and internet gossip. But last week, two witnesses called before a federal grand jury seated in Wilmington, Delaware, which is looking into the tax affairs of the president’s son, made the subject harder to avoid. First there was Lunden Roberts, with whom Biden has a three-year-old unacknowledged child. Then Zoe Kestan, an ex-girlfriend and lingerie and textile designer, spent five hours giving testimony on Biden’s spending, including – reportedly – stays at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, where, in 2018, allegedly, Biden was preoccupied with cooking crack cocaine. Wretched and salacious as that sounds, much of Hunter Biden’s story, detailed at length in his autobiography Beautiful Things, published last year, tends that way. “I’m not a curio or a sideshow to a moment in history,” Biden claimed in his book. “I’ve worked for someone other than my father, [I] rose and fell on my own.” But that’s not how Joe Biden’s political enemies see it. Donald Trump tried to make issue out of Hunter’s business dealings in Ukraine, Russia and China, which included high paid consultancies and gifts, and allegations that, as vice-president, Joe Biden had shaped American foreign policy in Ukraine to benefit his son. For Trump, it backfired, when efforts to uncover information about the Bidens and Ukraine helped to trigger his first impeachment. Then came the surfacing of Hunter Biden’s missing laptop, with its library of decadent pictures and business email chains, mysteriously left at a Wilmington repair shop, which found its way to Republican political operatives including Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon, plus the rightwing press and the FBI. On the political flip-side, House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff said the laptop was a “smear” from Russian intelligence, and 50 former intelligence officials said it was probably Russian disinformation. Now, however, almost no one disputes its authenticity. Hunter Biden confirmed that he was under federal investigation over a tax matter in December 2020, days after his father was elected president. Attorney general Bill Barr said he had “not seen a reason” to appoint a special counsel to oversee investigations, which include an investigation by a federal securities fraud unit in New York and another in Pennsylvania. Biden has not been charged with any crime, and Delaware attorney general David Weiss, who oversees the inquiry, is regarded as a straight-shooter unlikely to be swayed by political pressure. He was appointed by Trump on the recommendation of the state’s two Democratic senators and has not been replaced by Joe Biden. Weiss, according to Politico, avoided taking any decisions that would alert the public to the existence of the inquiry before the 2020 presidential election – and a repeat of the FBI’s Hillary Clinton missing emails investigation, which may have influenced the outcome of the 2016 contest. But the larger question – beyond whether Hunter Biden correctly met tax obligations during a period in which, by his own telling, he was being paid $50,000 a month by Ukrainian firm Burisma – are Biden’s financial ties to foreign figures and businesses while his father served as Barack Obama’s No 2. Illegal lobbying is an issue that shadowed Trump throughout his presidency, leading to the conviction of Paul Manafort, Trump’s 2016 campaign manager, on tax fraud charges. Manafort later pleaded guilty to violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara) by providing false statements, laundering money, witness tampering and failing to register as an agent of the Ukrainian government. Last year, Thomas Barrack, a friend and former adviser to Trump, was arrested charges that he and others failed to inform the US government that they were working to influence US foreign policy on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Under US statutes, all persons acting politically or quasi-politically on behalf of foreign entities in the US must properly disclose their activities. In addition to Hunter Biden’s ties to Ukraine through the gas company Burisma, he has sat on the boards of BHR Partners, a private investment fund backed by a number of Chinese state entities; a hedge fund, Paradigm; a consultancy, Seneca Global Advisors; and the fundraising firm Rosemont Seneca. Republicans, including the senior Iowa senator Chuck Grassley, have called on the justice department to evaluate whether Hunter or Joe Biden’s brother James Biden should have registered as foreign agents over their business arrangements with the Chinese government-backed energy company CEFC. In 2018, Business Insider reported that Hunter Biden sought an annual $2m retainer to aid in the recovery of Libyan assets frozen by the Obama administration during Muammar Gaddafi’s rule. The list of accusations goes on. According to Jonathan Turley, a legal scholar at the George Washington University Law School, “influence-peddling is a virtual spectator sport in the nation’s capital – a protected corruption”. Turley said: “It’s how powerful ruling elites make much of their money, and Congress has never seriously tried to crack down on it. The children and spouses of powerful leaders continue to receive windfall payments from companies and foreign interests, but we’ve never quite seen the likes of Hunter Biden’s enterprises. His contracts go beyond anything we’ve seen before.” Joe Biden has long insisted that his son did nothing wrong. “There’s nobody that’s indicated there’s a single solitary thing that he did that was inappropriate, wrong … or anything other than the appearance,” Biden said two years ago. But should the Delaware panel recommend criminal charges, it could ricochet around the second half of his father’s administration. Like Barr, the current US attorney general, Merrick Garland, has declined to appoint a special counsel. But if Republicans gain control of the legislature in November, pressure to appoint a prosecutor will certainly build, as it did from Trump with Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian election meddling or with Ken Starr, appointed to investigate the Clinton’s Whitewater investment dealings. “I don’t have any doubts that if they [Republicans] can, they will,” said James Carville, architect of Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential victory and Democratic party strategist throughout the 90s, with a long memory of politically inspired investigations. “At first you’re outraged, then it becomes the standard routine of everyday life. You become battle-hardened and immune to it. I think they spent 687 hours investigating the Clinton Christmas card list – a major, major investigation. I can’t tell you the amount of coverage and investigations that went into Whitewater, which was nothing. [And] Travelgate. Then you end up with an act of consensual sex and they go, ‘A-ha! We were right the whole time!’” But for presidential children, the stakes are different, and may have only have risen as Washington has become more partisan. “They find themselves in the spotlight whether they want to or not,” said Nancy Reagan biographer Bob Colacello. “Lynda Bird Johnson dating playboy movie star George Hamilton, Ron Reagan dropping out of Yale to become a ballet dancer, his sister Patti Davis marching with Nuclear Freeze protesters, Chelsea Clinton flopping as a TV news reporter, the Bush girls partying at downtown Manhattan clubs … all were tempests in teapots compared to the mess Hunter Biden has got himself into with his questionable business ventures in China and Ukraine.” One issue, says Kathleen Clark, a professor of Law at Washington University in St Louis, is that the financial conflict of interest law does not reach the adult children of elected officials. “There were similar, if not exactly parallel, problems with the adult children of Donald Trump trying to sell condos in India, [trying to] pursue business in other countries,” Clark points out. But efforts to investigate the Trump family are faltering. Last week, the New York district attorney’s investigation into whether the Trump Organization – which includes Trump sons Eric and Donald Jr as senior executives – inflated the value of assets to obtain favorable bank loans, appeared near to collapse when two prosecutors hired for the purpose resigned. But the Delaware grand jury in Hunter Biden’s affairs has greater scope. According to Tessa Capeloto, an attorney specializing in the Foreign Agents Registration Act at Wiley Rein, the impetus to look at influence-peddling violations has increased since a 2016 inspector-general’s report found that Fara was not being enforced as aggressively as needed. “There’s been a concerted effort by DOJ to see that the statute has some teeth and is being effectively administered and enforced. The statute is out there for a reason, which is to ensure that certain political and quasi-political activities undertaken on behalf of foreign interests are reported and made transparent.”",News/US news,Stealth Hunter: Biden’s tangled business dealings are becoming hard to ignore,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/hunter-biden-joe-biden-president-business-dealings
2/27/2022,"From selling books out of Jeff Bezos’s garage to a global conglomerate with a yearly revenue topping $400bn (£290bn), much of the monstrous growth of Amazon has been fuelled by its customers’ data. Continuous analysis of customer data determines, among other things, prices, suggested purchases and what profitable own-label products Amazon chooses to produce. The 200 million users who are Amazon Prime members are not only the corporation’s most valuable customers but also their richest source of user data. The more Amazon and services you use – whether it’s the shopping app, the Kindle e-reader, the Ring doorbell, Echo smart speaker or the Prime streaming service – the more their algorithms can infer what kind of person you are and what you are most likely to buy next. The firm’s software is so accomplished at prediction that third parties can hire its algorithms as a service called Amazon Forecast. Not everyone is happy about this level of surveillance. Those who have requested their data from Amazon are astonished by the vast amounts of information they are sent, including audio files from each time they speak to the company’s voice assistant, Alexa. Like its data-grabbing counterparts Google and Facebook, Amazon’s practices have come under the scrutiny of regulators. Last year, Amazon was hit with a $886.6m (£636m) fine for processing personal data in violation of EU data protection rules, which it is appealing against. And a recent Wired investigation showed concerning privacy and security failings at the tech giant. So, what data does Amazon collect and share and what can you do to stop it? Strict EU regulation in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK equivalent the Data Protection Act limit the ways personal data can be used in Europe compared with the US. But, according to Amazon’s privacy policy, the tech giant still collects a large amount of information. This covers three areas: information you give Amazon, data it collects automatically and information from other sources such as delivery data from carriers. Amazon can collect your name, address, searches and recordings when you speak to the Alexa voice assistant. It knows your orders, content you watch on Prime, your contacts if you upload them and communications with it via email. Meanwhile, when you use its website, cookie trackers are used to “enhance your shopping experience” and improve its services, Amazon says. Some of the data is used for “personalisation” – big tech speak for using your data to improve your online experience – but it can reveal a lot about you. For example, if you just use its online retail site via the app or website, Amazon will collect data such as purchase dates and payment and delivery information. “From this information, Amazon can work out where you work, where you live, how you spend your leisure time and who your family and friends are,” says Rowenna Fielding, director of data protection consultancy Miss IG Geek. At the same time, Prime Video and Fire TV information about what you watch and listen to can reveal your politics, religion, culture and economic status, says Fielding. If you use Amazon to store your photos, a facial recognition feature is enabled by default, she says. “Amazon promises not to share facial recognition data with third parties. But it makes no such commitment about other types of photo data, such as geolocation tags, device information or attributes of people and objects featured in images.” Amazon Photos does not sell customer information and data to third parties or use content for ad targeting, an Amazon spokesperson says, insisting the feature is for ease of use. You also have the option to turn the feature off in the Amazon Photos app or on the website. Meanwhile, Amazon’s Kindle e-reader will collect data such as what you read, when, how fast you read, what you’ve highlighted and book genres. “This could reveal a lot about your thoughts, feelings, preferences and beliefs,” says Fielding, pointing out that how often you look up words might indicate how literate you are in a certain language. Smart speakers have been criticised by privacy advocates and devices such as Amazon’s Echo have been known to be activated accidentally. But Amazon says its Echo devices are designed to record “as little audio as possible”. No audio is stored or sent to the cloud unless the device detects the wake word and the audio stream is closed immediately after a request has ended, an Amazon spokesperson says. More broadly, Amazon says much of the information it collects is needed to keep its products working properly. An Amazon spokesperson says the company is “thoughtful about the information we collect”. But it can add up to a lot of data. In 2020, a BBC investigation showed how every motion detected by its Ring doorbells and each interaction with the app is stored, including the model of phone or tablet and mobile network used. Ring can share your stored data with law enforcement, if you give your consent or if a warrant is issued. The more services you use, the bigger Amazon’s opportunity to collect your data. “If you have bought fully into the Amazon experience, you will share details, habits and information that the company will collect and potentially use to ‘enhance your experience’,” says Richard Hale, a senior lecturer in digital forensics at Birmingham City University. But what exactly is shared within its own companies isn’t clear. The privacy policy section on data sharing within the Amazon group of companies is “pretty limited”, says Will Richmond-Coggan, an information and privacy law specialist at Freeths LLP. Taking this into account, he says, people should “assume that any information shared with one Amazon entity will be known to any other”. Like Google and Facebook, Amazon operates an advertising network allowing advertisers to use its customer data for targeting. “Although Amazon doesn’t share information that can directly identify someone, such as a name or email address, it does allow advertisers to target by demographic, location, interests and previous purchases,” says Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech. Amazon lets other companies track users visiting its website, says Wolfie Christl, a researcher who investigates the data industry. “It lets companies such as Google and Facebook ‘tag’ people and synchronise identifiers that refer to them. These companies can then potentially better track people on the web and exchange data on them.” Amazon says it doesn’t sell your data to third parties or use personally identifiable information such as your name or email for advertising purposes. Advertising audiences are only available within its ads systems and cannot be exported and you can opt out of ad targeting via its advertising preferences page. Amazon’s data collection is so vast that the only way to stop it completely is not to use the service at all. That requires a lot of dedication but there are some ways to reduce the amount of data collected and shared. If you are concerned about what Amazon knows about you, you can ask the company for a copy of your data by applying under a “data subject access request”. The Alexa assistant and Ring doorbell have their own privacy hubs that allow you to delete recordings and adjust privacy settings. Ring’s Control Centre allows you to tweak settings including who’s able to see and access your videos and personal information from a central dashboard. Speaking to Alexa, you can say: “Alexa, delete what I just said” or: “Alexa, delete everything I said today.” Amazon says it allows customers to view their browsing and purchase history from “Your Account” and manage which items can be used for product recommendations. More broadly, you can also use privacy-focused browsers such as DuckDuckGo or Brave to stop Amazon from tracking you. But it’s not always easy to change the settings on Amazon itself, says Chris Boyd, lead analyst at security company Malwarebytes. He recommends turning off browsing history on Amazon and opting out of interest-based ads to reduce the level of tracking by the company. Yet he warns: “You’ll likely still see ads from Amazon or encounter third-party advertisers in one form or another – they just won’t be as targeted.”",News/Technology,The data game: what Amazon knows about you and how to stop it,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/27/the-data-game-what-amazon-knows-about-you-and-how-to-stop-it
2/27/2022,"Audrey Magee likes to keep her readers at arm’s length. Her first novel, The Undertaking, shortlisted for both the Women’s prize and the Irish book awards, impassively dissected the lives of ordinary Germans caught up in Hitler’s murderous determination to obliterate the Soviet Union. In that novel, emotions were bleached from the page, forcing the reader to dispassionately observe action and reaction, choice and choicelessness. Her follow-up, The Colony, set in Magee’s native Ireland, applies much the same technique but now the distancing seems much more at home. Following in the literary tradition of Synge, Trevor and Tóibín, The Colony portrays Irish lives cornered by the dead weight of tradition. Characters do very little very slowly and discontents are expressed sardonically or obliquely, if at all. Naturally, there’s also an equally traditional smattering of merciless killing and colonising foreigners. And Magee’s setting is traditionally remote, an Atlantic island off Ireland’s west coast, three miles long, with its 1979 population now down to double figures. Into this stride two incomers. Lloyd is a London artist looking to revitalise his flagging career (and his marriage to a “darling dealer”) and he opts to come the hard way. Eschewing the ferry, he opts for a hand-rowed currach and pays the inevitable price with his breakfast. He has arranged to rent a cottage for the summer, to “paint the cliffs”. Needing and expecting solitude, Lloyd is less than gruntled to find the neighbouring cottage soon occupied by Jean-Pierre, a French linguist, who has made the island his doctoral test tube for the last five summers, charting and recording this surviving outpost of spoken Irish. The Frenchman is equally disgruntled to discover an Englishman on “his” island, corrupting the purity of his experiment by dragging the increasingly bilingual islanders further towards the colonisers’ language. JP, as they know him, is no dispassionate observer - he is an evangelist for endangered dialects. Later, a somewhat off-the-peg backstory of Franco-Algerian disharmony will explain his fervour. Inevitably, the two men lock horns, like “two bulls in a field”, each mocking the other’s mythologising of the islanders. So it is left to James, whom JP infuriatingly addresses as Seamus, to become the go-between. He is one of the island’s few remaining teenagers and is determined not to succumb to a life as a fisherman (barely surprising as both his father and grandfather drowned). Befriending Lloyd, James discovers a natural aptitude for painting – it may be a naive skill but the professional artist sees that the boy’s canvases have an immediacy he will never match. Lloyd has come to the island as a Gauguin only to discover that one of the Tahitians is already the finer artist. Soon, James aspires to return with him to London, to become an artist in his own right; Lloyd encourages these dreams, quite possibly in order to keep feeding off the boy’s vision. His widowed mother – by day secretly life-modelling for Lloyd and by night secretly slipping into JP’s bed – warns that London won’t be easy for him: the Troubles have just claimed Mountbatten. In fact, the book is punctuated by brief, fact-cool reportage of sectarian and terrorist killings – committed by all sides – which begin as choral intrusions between chapters but in time seep into the islanders’ own conversation. Magee’s prose is always luminous, lyrical and pungent: sometimes sliding into vertical columns of one-word paragraphs, sometimes dwelling on the minutiae of rabbit gutting or the smell of Prussian blue, and yet always remaining ever so slightly distanced. And it would be wrong to say the book rises to a climax: in true Irish tradition, the story shrinks back to its status quo ante. Lloyd sails back “to Freud, to Auerbach, to Bacon”, JP’s professorship is in the bag and that very special Irish melancholy settles again over the island.

2/27/2022,"Thanks to new legislation that went into place at the beginning of this year, I predict that a lot of unsuspecting small business owners are about to fall victim to a fresh scam. The scam will relate to legislation around new tax reporting rules that will affect millions of freelancers and small businesses. As I explained in an earlier column, beginning for the 2022 tax year, if you receive more than $600 in total payments during the course of the year from a payment service like PayPal, Venmo (which is owned by PayPal), Square, Stripe or online sales of your products made through Amazon, Etsy and other marketplaces – regardless of how many customers are paying – that payment service is required to report that amount to the IRS and to you by sending a Form 1099-K – used for reporting payments via these third parties – in early 2023. You may think this is a headache, but it’s nothing compared with the headache now faced by these payment providers. They now have an enormous new tax reporting requirement. Unfortunately, these providers probably don’t have all the information they need about all the businesses they serve in order to properly file these forms, and if they don’t get that information, the rules say that they’re required to withhold 24% of the payment and remit to the IRS. They don’t want to do that and small businesses don’t want this to happen either. So they will soon be reaching out to their customers for more information. Already, they’re laying the tracks. “You may notice that in the coming months we will ask you for your tax information, like a Social Security Number or Tax ID, if you haven’t provided it to us already, in order to continue using your account to accept payments for the sale of goods and services transactions and to ensure there aren’t any issues when these changes take effect in 2022,” PayPal said in a statement. “This helps us meet our obligations to the IRS and ensures that you will be able to continue using your account and access PayPal and Venmo features and services.” Enter the scammers. Starting mid-year, I predict, millions of individuals and small businesses will be receiving requests from payment services they used asking to provide or update their personal information – including their social security and tax identification numbers – so that those services can comply with the new 1099 rules. They’ll come by email mostly, although some will be by text. Unfortunately, a scammer can also send a fake text or email – or millions of fake texts and emails – to small businesses that look genuine but surreptitiously divert you to a fake website that not only collects your most personal data but also can download malware into your network to be used for future attacks and mischief. These are called “phishing” scams. You’ve heard of this. Hopefully, your payment vendor has received this information from your business already. And if your business is set up to receive remittances from a payment service provider then it’s likely that the payment service provider has a direct portal on its website for you to update your company’s 1099 information. Stripe, for example, offers detailed guidance for doing this. So do PayPal, Apple, Square and Cash App. But some people aren’t going to do this. And although the IRS provides guidance for avoiding scams during tax season and throughout the year, the agency isn’t able to help a small business owner if they fall victim to someone who is pretending to be a payment service like PayPal, Venmo, Stripe, Square, and all the other companies that – at least as far as I can tell – aren’t doing a whole lot right now to warn their customers of these potential scams. So please – be careful. Take a few minutes to visit every one of your payment service providers’ websites and update your 1099 information. Train your financial employees that may be receiving email requests to know what to look for. If you’re not sure of a sender, then ignore the email. Report any suspicious requests directly to the payment service provider. If you are submitting information, make sure you’re doing it directly on the payment provider’s website and avoid clicking on any links in an email. Otherwise you’ll be opening yourself up to serious problems. By mid-year I predict you’ll be hearing a lot more about this scam. Start paying attention now.",Lifestyle/Money,Beware: new IRS rules will lead a wave of phishing frauds | Gene Marks,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/27/beware-phising-fraud-new-irs-rules-online-payment-service-receipts
2/27/2022,"I’m actually rather sorry for Linda Evangelista. Everybody wants to feel acceptable, after all, and she exists in a world where, despite all the modern declarations of diversity and body positivity, when the woman hits the catwalk she still has to be slim. In her 50s, and gobsmackingly pretty, Evangelista chose to get a treatment called cryolipolysis, where body fat is frozen till it dies, and you poop it out. It went wrong, and though she doesn’t look particularly unusual to me, she – much because of the world she’s always lived in – feels brutally disfigured. Cosmetic plastic surgery is generally taken to mean surgery to improve someone’s looks, as opposed to surgery to make them look acceptable – and that’s one massive grey area right there. Trying to avoid the imperfections of nature and time is a risky business. This is not new. I’m reminded of Gladys (pronounced Glaydeez) Deacon, the second wife of the ninth Duke of Marlborough. Gladys looks fabulous in her 1901 portrait by Boldini, when she was 20. But two years later, she had paraffin wax injected into the top of her nose, to give her the classical straight Greek profile: no dent from forehead to bridge. But that went wrong, too: the wax melted, and dripped down inside her skin to sag in her jawline. Not many years later, recalcitrant and desperate soldiers on the western front injected that same wax into their legs, hoping to induce the inflammation and ulcers of paraffinoma, which they prayed would get them sent home. Meanwhile, stories circulated that Gladys sat by a fire, massaging the wax back up. In the Indian subcontinent 2,500 years ago, noses would be sliced off as punishment for theft or adultery: a very visible shame. The ancient Sushruta Samhita medical text, written in the 6th century BC, includes detailed instructions for nose reconstruction: take a triangular flap of skin from the forehead, leave it attached between the eyebrows so as to preserve the blood supply, twist it round and lay it over a feather quill or piece of twig. Stitch into position. This technique travelled, and was useful when noses were lost to syphilis or duels (more visible shame). But then scarred foreheads were a problem, so a technique developed where the flap was taken from the forearm instead. It then had to be strapped to the head in a kind of straitjacket for as long as it took for the flap to attach and heal into the face. During the first world war, the pioneering surgeon Sir Harold Gillies invented the long pedicle, whereby rather than bringing the wound site to the graft site, the graft would be brought to the wound, on a long piece of still-attached skin and some blood vessels. His stroke of genius was to let the skin roll up protectively round the blood vessels, and stitch it loosely into place: good hygiene for a longwinded process. As a result, his maxillofacial reconstruction ward at the Queen’s Hospital in Sidcup, Kent, was nicknamed Borneo – a reference to all the looping flesh-and-blood stem-like lianas. Gillies was an important character in one of my novels, and once, after a talk I gave, an old lady came up and told me how, as a small girl in the 1930s she had a drooping eyelid, and Gillies had fixed it – using a bit of kangaroo tendon. It was a most surreal moment. His patients were healthy men who fell victim to trench warfare: head injuries were manifold, especially before the British Army started providing helmets in 1915. Survival itself was often a miracle, and looking acceptable was unlikely. Cinemas provided a useful career for these men: a projectionist was safe in the dark. (Pedicles are still used. I was almost disappointed when my late husband’s, which went from his side to where his jaw used to be, rebuilding after cancer, turned out to be under his skin – though irritatingly it lay like a stray cable over his clavicle, rather than tucked neatly underneath.) The definition in the US of “acceptable” was generally “not too ethnic”: safer to look like where you’ve come to, not where you’d come from. Previous waves of immigration had been Irish and German – so Irish and German was how you needed to look, to match those more settled and wealthy. By 1923, Fanny Brice, the famed vaudeville comedian with Yiddish-accented routines, wanted to be accepted as serious, not a self-described “cartoonist working in the flesh”. As the New York wit Dorothy Parker put it, “She cut off her nose to spite her race”. The plastic surgeon who carried out the work had no medical degree and retouched the before and after pictures. Brice didn’t like the result, and it didn’t get her more serious gigs – though when she divorced six years later, her lawyer claimed her husband was so uncomfortable with his wife’s new beauty, he sought the company of less attractive women. The lists of horror stories, and of modern stars unhappy with the results of having succumbed to the pressure to go under the knife, are as long as your arm. Surgery is frightening, uncomfortable and risky, yet many still oscillate between fear and vanity. The desire for permanent physical perfection and the terror of being unacceptable seem unabated. This has brought extraordinary, ingenious, disgusting, miraculous surgical developments, but it continues to betray us. Poor Linda.
