Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has suspended its operations in Russia amid pressure from authorities. The organisation said its journalists there have been continuously threatened, intimidated and harassed by authorities and its operation been the subject of bankruptcy proceedings. ""These Kremlin attacks on RFE/RL’s ability to operate in Russia are the culmination of a years-long pressure campaign against RFE/RL, which has maintained a physical presence in Russia since 1991 when it established its Moscow bureau at the invitation of then-President Boris Yeltsin,"" the company said. The announcement comes as Russians could now face prison sentences of up to 15 years for spreading information that runs counter to the government's position on the invasion of Ukraine. RFE/RL President Jamie Fly said: ""Following years of threats, intimidation and harassment of our journalists, the Kremlin, desperate to prevent Russian citizens from knowing the truth about its illegal war in Ukraine, is now branding honest journalists as traitors to the Russian state.""

""Several air raids were made on columns of enemy equipment, and the losses are being clarified,"" they added.

In Mariupol, which came under blockade on Saturday, the report says Russians continue to block the city and carry out artillery shelling of the city's civilian infrastructure. Ukraine is bleeding but has not fallen, and stands with both feet on the ground, said Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Dmytro Kuleba. Applauding the country's armed forces in pushing back Russian forces on a number of fronts, Mr Kuleba said ""the myth of the unbeatable and almighty army is already ruined."" He said the defence forces have achieved some major successes over the past 24 hours and that the Russians keep bearing devastating losses on the ground. ""Ukraine is bleeding but Ukraine as not fallen and stands with both feet on the ground,"" he said. Crowds of men have been lining up in Kyiv to join the Ukrainian army.

And our guys that are actually standing there and fighting Russian military forces,"" he told Sky News. ""We know what we are doing and that's why we will win."" Others, like British Army veteran Mark Ayres, travelled to Ukraine to help. Mr Ayres said the Ukrainian people have been inspiring and ""it's galvanized everybody."" ""I've got no illusions. I've got no romantic ideas of war or like 'I'm going to be some hero' or make a difference . but it is what I do,"" he said.

Mr Biden, who spoke on Saturday evening with President Zelensky, said he welcomed the moves by Visa and Mastercard to suspend payment services in Russia, adding that his administration was working closer with Ukraine to offer more support and with Congress to secure more funding. ""President Biden noted his administration is surging security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine and is working closely with Congress to secure additional funding."" ""President Biden reiterated his concern about the recent Russian attack on a Ukrainian nuclear power plant, and he commended the skill and bravery of the Ukrainian operators who have kept the reactors in safe condition. The leaders also discussed the recent talks between Russia and Ukraine."" Volunteers have been weaving camouflage nets for the Ukrainian army. For fear of damage, volunteers are also covering and wrapping statues and windows on several of the historically significant structures. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk for giving Ukraine access to his company's satellite-internet system, Starlink.

The US State Department said Mr Blinken underscored that the world is acting in unison in response to Russian aggression and ensuring that Moscow will pay a high price. China has broken with the US, Europe and others that have imposed sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. China said that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations should be respected, but that sanctions create new issues and disrupt the process of political settlement. Hundreds of men have been lining up in Kyiv to join the Ukrainian army. An order from Ukraine's government prohibited men between the ages of 18 and 60 from leaving the country to keep them available for military conscription. But some, like Volodymyr Onysko, volunteered to fight. ""We know why we are here. We know why we defend our country.
