1/10/2022,"The National Labor Relations Board wants Whole Foods to reverse a ban on employees wearing BLM masks. In a filing obtained by Bloomberg, Whole Foods responds to labor board prosecutors' claims that such a ban is illegal. Lawyers for Whole Foods argue the NLRB is trying to violate its First Amendment rights, per Bloomberg. Whole Foods has claimed that the US is attempting to violate its constitutional rights by forcing it to allow its employees to wear Black Lives Matter insignia on the job, according to a court filing obtained by Bloomberg. Lawyers for the Amazon-owned grocery chain made the claim in a December 17 filing, in which they respond to National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) claims that Whole Foods illegally banned employees from wearing Black Lives Matter masks at work, Bloomberg said. In the December 17 filing, Whole Foods accuses NLRB consul Jennifer Abruzzo of breaching the company's First Amendment rights by trying to ""compel"" speech and '""unlawfully infringing upon and/or diluting"" Whole Foods' ""protected trademarks,"" Bloomberg reported. The December 17 filing responds to a complaint made by the NLRB in early December. Bloomberg said it obtained the December 17 filing through a Freedom of Information Act request. The filing was not immediately available to Insider. A spokesperson for Whole Foods did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. In July 2020, a group of employees sued Whole Foods claiming the company forbade them from wearing Black Lives Matter masks at work, and threatened them with termination if they did. The lawsuit said that employees had ""commonly worn Pride flags in support of their LGBTQ+ coworkers without being disciplined by Whole Foods"" and said that its ""selective enforcement"" of its dress code ""constitutes unlawful discrimination."" In October 2020, Whole Foods announced a new dress code for all workers in its stores that banned visible logos, slogans, messages, or flags of any kind, among other things, Insider's Avery Hartman reported. In a filing in early December 2021, the NLRB claimed that Whole Foods was in violation of federal labor law, under which workers have the right to engage in ""concerted activities for their mutual aid and protection."" In a counter-filing later that month, Whole Foods argued that workers' rights to participate in collective action tied to the workplace do not include BLM messages. Blacks Lives Matter is ""not objectively understood to relate to workplace issues or improving working conditions at WFM's retail grocery stores,"" Whole Foods attorneys wrote, per Bloomberg.

1/10/2022,"A day after announcing he's running for a third term, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson launched two statewide TV campaign ads Monday with a blunt message: The country ""is in trouble"" and he's ready to ""stand and fight for freedom."" Johnson's campaign did not announce how much money it was putting behind the ads but said the 30-second spots are due to air for several weeks. Subscribe to our On Wisconsin Politics newsletter for the week's political news explained. Tens of millions of dollars are expected to be spent in one of the country's pivotal contests, with control of the U.S. Senate at stake. Democrats will be spending on two tracks ahead of the Aug. 9 primary, with candidates trying to get their messages out while the party and its allies aim to define Johnson with voters. More: Meet the Democrats already running for Ron Johnson's seat in Wisconsin's 2022 Senate race Johnson's first ad salvos were his attempt to shape the contours of the race. In an ad titled ""Stand and Fight,"" the 66-year-old Oshkosh Republican said, ""Democrat policies have been disastrous for America,"" and as news footage played he spoke of ""the 2020 summer riots, defunding the police, lowering bail and not prosecuting criminals."" And he talked of ""Kenosha set on fire, a growing number of murders in Milwaukee and the Waukesha Christmas Parade turned into a terrible tragedy."" In a reference to his decision to break a campaign pledge to serve only two terms, Johnson explained: ""It feels like our country is being torn apart. That's not how it felt when I ran in 2016. Back then, I intended to serve a second term and go home. But now with Democrats in total control, our nation is on a very dangerous path. ""If you're in a position to help make our country safer and stronger would you just walk away? I've decided I can't. I'll stand and fight for freedom."" State Democrats had a message of their own for Johnson: putting up billboards in Milwaukee, Beloit, Kenosha and Oshkosh, attacking the senator on taxes. ""Ron Johnson’s top priority has been enriching himself and his biggest donors at the expense of Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler said. “We’re reminding Wisconsinites that Johnson, who has repeatedly tried to raise costs for hardworking Wisconsinites, doesn’t think the ultra-wealthy like him need to pay their fair share of taxes.” Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

1/10/2022,"A view of the arch at Montana de Oro State Park in California. (Flickr/Randy Robinson) Not even the magic of Christmas could save an iconic California rock formation from collapsing. On Christmas Eve, the historic rock arch along a S an Luis Obispo beach in California's Montana de Oro State Park, situated about halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, collapsed in on itself, according to reporting from the Los Angeles Times. The rock formation's collapse has been blamed on the record-breaking weather in California during the month of December, which seemingly weathered the ancient arch until it could no longer stand. The December rainfall totals in San Luis Obispo County were as high as 12 inches, and the storms that have pelted the coast have brought high waves, pounding fragile coastal features. A view of the arch, now collapsed, at Montana de Oro State Park. (Flickr/Randy Robinson) Eric Hjelstrom, chief ranger for the San Luis Obispo Coast District of California State Parks, noted that the caves and arches that form along the coast are caused by the waves crashing into the sandstone cliff-laced coastline. They're part of ""what gives you the allure of this part of California,"" Hjelstrom told the Los Angeles Times, adding that ""the same force that creates the arch eventually destroys it."" The arch had been a fixture of the local area since at least the 1870s, according to Dan Kreiger, a professor emeritus of history at Cal Poly. It is possible that the arch had been on the California coast for centuries before collapsing, he told the Los Angeles Times. ""I knew that [the arch] was fragile,"" Kreiger said. ""I just fell in love with it, and when I heard it was gone, I felt a sense of loss."" Other local residents paid their tributes to the arch online, sharing the many photos they have taken over the years at the famous spot. ""As kids, we'd play underneath the arch, imagining that it would fall down. It was a magical little place where we used to play,"" Sarah Mavety, owner/chef at Hazard's in Los Osos, California, told The SLO Tribune.

1/10/2022,"A kidnapped teenager may be in Virginia with her boyfriend and his mom, North Carolina officials said. The Craven County Sheriff’s Office said it’s searching for 15-year-old Olivia Venters, last seen on Sunday, Jan. 9. Deputies in a news release shared details about an “Abducted Juvenile from Vanceboro, N.C.” but didn’t say whether she was kidnapped from there or if that was where she lived. The town is near New Bern and roughly 115 miles southeast of Raleigh. Officials said Venters was last known to be in Virginia with her 15-year-old boyfriend and his mother, Rebecca Caton. “Caton was last seen driving a 2005 Gold Nissan Altima with North Carolina registration TJH9385,” the sheriff’s office wrote in its news release. “Felony warrants have been issued against Rebecca Caton for first degree kidnapping.” Anyone with information is urged to call law enforcement officers, such as Craven County deputies at 252-633-2357 or 252-636-6620.

1/10/2022,"Police in one Florida city are were left mystified after a lost 4-pound chihuahua safely traveled nearly 70 miles in three months. The 10-year-old dog, named Tiny, was found Dec. 30 wandering the sands of Clearwater Beach, according to the Clearwater Police Department. Clearwater is about 25 miles west of downtown Tampa. “If only Tiny could talk, she might be able to shed some light on how she made it from Bartow to Clearwater Beach,” the police wrote on Facebook. “What we do know is she turned up missing in September from her family’s back yard in Polk County. Fast forward to the last week of December, when Officer Ryan Kenna found a wayward pooch near Tower 1 on Clearwater Beach. ... After some investigative digging, they learned through a chip that the dog came from Polk County — more than 67 miles away.” Tiny’s owner, Sophia Burgess, told police the family had continued to hope their dog would be found, and had an ongoing search that included signs throughout their neighborhood. Still, she was wary when Clearwater police called late in the day on Dec. 30. The facility was closing for the three-day New Year’s Day weekend, so she would have to wait a bit longer to know for sure. Burgess said she decided not to tell her two children about the call “in case there was some type of mix-up and it wasn’t Tiny after all,” according to the release. Three days later, when the facility reopened, Tiny crawled into her arms. Burgess’ two children “were overcome with emotion at the unexpected reunion.” “They cried like babies,” she said in the release. How Tiny got so far away from their backyard is a mystery to her, too. “I wish I had the answer to all of those questions,” Burgess said. “I’ve never even been to Clearwater.” The discovery happened not long after Burgess’ 15-year-old daughter, Jaliyah, admitted to having “a dream that Tiny came home,” she told police. Officer Ryan Kenna said he was grateful to be part of an old fashioned happy ending. “It was the perfect time of year just after Christmas and starting off the new year on a better page for the family,” he said in the release.
