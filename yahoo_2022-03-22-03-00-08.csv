3/22/2022,"An Amazon driver is going viral after sharing his biggest on-the-job pet peeves. The behind-the-scenes look at life as a delivery driver comes courtesy of a TikToker named @revengekkid. In his post, he outlined the three things he wishes he had known before he started working for the e-commerce giant. His list, which includes issues with “group deliveries” and apartment complexes, is part of a wider trend on the app. For months, delivery drivers have used TikTok to share their experiences — from what it’s like to work for FedEx after Cyber Monday to how Instacart customers can “scam” their drivers. In @revengekkid’s video, he started by explaining how much apartment buildings can slow down a workday. “If you get an apartment during the day and you’ve got houses, it’s over,” he said. “Don’t expect to get off early.” His frustration seems to come from the fact that delivery instructions for apartments are often unclear. It’s an issue DoorDash drivers have also expressed in their own viral TikToks. Some apartments are extremely big, or they might have security codes or entrance methods that drivers aren’t aware of. The second issue, @revengekkid said, is having to assist other drivers during a shift. “If you go faster in the day like I do,” he said, “they’ll have you go help somebody else.” For @revengekkid, the final pet peeve was what he referred to as “group deliveries.” This is when multiple houses in a similar area can count as a single delivery. The result, he said, is that drivers end up delivering more packages than they expected to. Up your Instagram game with these menswear fashion tips: TikTok users had mixed reactions to @revengekkid’s video. Many took the chance to share their own frustrations with delivery jobs, while others said @revengekkid was overreacting. “People complain about everything,” one user wrote. But @revengekkid made it clear that he doesn’t view his job as negatively as it might seem. In a follow-up video, the TikToker shared three things he actually likes about working for Amazon. Among those, @ revengekkid mentioned the company’s voluntary time off (VTO) policy, which allows workers to end their shifts early or take extra days off. This practice has been questioned in the past, however, since the time off is unpaid, but @revengekkid said he’s happy to take it. “When they offer VTO, ooh I’m on that,” he said. “Give me that VTO.” The post Amazon driver reveals the 3 things he wishes he knew before taking his job appeared first on In The Know.

3/22/2022,"The reported deaths of five Russian generals in Ukraine is a sign of significant trouble for the Kremlin’s invasion, retired U.S. Gen. David Petraeus told Jake Tapper on CNN Sunday. “This is very, very uncommon. This is in the first three weeks,” said Petraeus. “These are quite senior generals.” Petraeus said four of the deaths have been confirmed. “I think the fifth we’ll hear today,” he added. Petraeus attributed the deaths to a variety of factors, including Ukrainians jamming Russian communications, skilled snipers and a Russian military structure that keeps decisions in very few hands. “The bottom line is that their command and control has broken down. Their communications have been jammed by the Ukrainians,” Petraeus said. “Their secure coms didn’t work. They had to go to a single channel that’s jammable ― and that’s exactly what the Ukrainians have been doing to that.” Without communication options, the military column gets stopped. And when an impatient general heads to the front to find out what’s going on, he’s shot and killed. “The Ukrainians have very, very good snipers and they’ve just been picking them off left and right,” Petraeus added. Retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe, also said the Russians were in trouble in Ukraine. “Russian generals are running out of time, ammunition and manpower,” Hodges wrote in an assessment last week for the Center for European Policy Analysis. “That’s not based on any inside intelligence — it’s clear from open source information and my own experience.” In the latest blow to Russian military leadership, officials confirmed Sunday that navy commander Andrei Paly was killed in fighting in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Agence France-Presse reported. Paly, 51, was the deputy commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet. Check out Petraeus’ full interview in the video clip above. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/22/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Monday it had struck a Kyiv shopping centre with high-precision long-range weapons because it was being used as a rocket store and reloading station by Ukrainian forces. The Kyiv shopping centre was attacked late on Sunday, killing at least eight people, wrecking nearby buildings and leaving smoking piles of rubble and the twisted wreckage of burned-out cars spread over several hundred metres. ""The areas near the shopping centre were used as a large base for storing rocket munitions and for reloading multiple rocket launchers,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told reporters. ""High-precision long-range weapons on the night of March 21 destroyed a battery of Ukrainian multiple rocket launchers and a store of ammunition in a non-functioning shopping center,"" he said. Konashenkov showed video which he said showed that Ukraine had been using the shopping centre as a weapons store and reloading station. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced 10 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States. President Vladimir Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia. Russia, he said, had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Ukraine. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence against a Russian imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia that the Kremlin says amount to a declaration of economic war by the United States and its allies. China has called for calm. Moscow says Western media have given a one-sided version of the war while ignoring Russian narratives. ""We would like to again remind Western media: we have given complete evidence showing that the Kyiv nationalistic regime has used civilian objects in residential areas of Kyiv and in other cities as artillery and rocket system firing positions,"" Konashenkov said. Konashenkov said Russia's operation was being carried out by a professional and well-armed forces and denied Ukrainian claims that Russian forces had hit any civilian objects. He dismissed Ukrainian claims about Russian losses of personnel and equipment as ""propaganda lies"".

3/22/2022,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Japan says Russian amphibious ships transiting through a narrow strait between its islands could be moving fresh forces from Russia’s far east to Ukraine. Four landing ship tanks, including one with its deck full of military trucks, were seen sailing in the Pacific Ocean westbound in the middle of last week, according to a news release from the Joint Staff’s Public Affairs office within Japan’s Defense Ministry. The hull numbers on the Russian ships, shown in photographs released by Japan, suggests the ships were the Alligator IV-class Nikolay Vilkov; the Ropucha I-class Oslyabya and Admiral Nevelskov; and the Ropucha II-class Peresvet. All four belong to the Russian Navy’s Pacific Fleet and make up the entirety of its major amphibious units. The ships were traveling in two groups. One was comprised of Nikolay Vilkov and Oslyabya, first seen heading west in the evening of March 15, 70 kilometers (38 nautical miles) northeast of Cape Shiryazaki on the northern tip of Japan’s main island of Honshu. Photos released by the ministry showed the top deck of the Nikolay Vilkov packed with at least 17 military trucks. All four ships also have internal holds capable of carrying various cargo or troops. The Admiral Nevelskov and Peresvet were then detected by Japan on the morning of March 16, 220 kilometers northeast of Cape Shiryazaki. The ships then proceeded through the narrow Tsugaru Strait, which separates Honshu from Japan’s northern main island of Hokkaido. The vessels were watched from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force’s destroyer JS Shiranui and P-3C maritime patrol aircraft. Japanese media reported the ministry believes the ships were bringing additional units from Russia’s far east to shore up its forces involved in the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine’s Defence Ministry backed up this claim, saying March 18 that the Russian 155th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade, based in the port city of Vladivostok, and the 40th Separate Naval Infantry Brigade, out of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, were heading west to “make up for the losses” suffered in Ukraine. Both naval infantry units are assigned to the Russian military’s Eastern Military District. The route taken by the Russian ships appears to suggest they were heading from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in Russia’s Kamchakta Peninsula to Vladivostok, where they will most likely be loaded onto westbound trains if they are indeed bound for Ukraine. Japan has designated the Tsugaru Strait an international waterway, allowing foreign ships to transit through it. The country claims territorial waters in the strait that extend 3 nautical miles from its coast, significantly less than the maximum of 12 nautical miles allowed under international law.",World/Defense News,Japan spots Russian amphibious ships traveling between its islands,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-spots-russian-amphibious-ships-161608407.html
