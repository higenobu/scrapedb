12/20/2021,"Donald Trump is increasingly agitated by the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack, according to sources familiar with the matter, and appears anxious he might be implicated in the sprawling inquiry into the insurrection even as he protests his innocence. Related: Republicans are shamelessly working to subvert democracy. Are Democrats paying attention? The former president in recent weeks has complained more about the investigation, demanding why his former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, shared so much material about 6 January with the select committee, and why dozens of other aides have also cooperated. Trump has also been perturbed by aides invoking the Fifth Amendment in depositions - it makes them look weak and complicit in a crime, he has told associates - and considers them foolish for not following the lead of his former strategist Steve Bannon in simply ignoring the subpoenas. When Trump sees new developments in the Capitol attack investigation on television, he has started swearing about the negative coverage and bemoaned that the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, was too incompetent to put Republicans on the committee to defend him. The former president’s anger largely mirrors the kind of expletives he once directed at the Russia inquiry and the special counsel investigation when he occupied the White House. But the rapidly accelerating investigation into whether Trump and top aides unlawfully conspired to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory at the 6 January joint session appears to be unnerving him deeply. The portrait that emerges from interviews with multiple sources close to Trump, including current and former aides, suggest a former president unmoored and backed into a corner by the rapid escalation in intensity of the committee’s investigation. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to requests for comment. But as Trump struggles to shield himself from the select committee, with public hearings next year and the justice department said to be tracking the investigation, the path ahead is only likely to be more treacherous. The former president is especially attuned to his potential for legal exposure, even as he maintains he did nothing wrong in conferring about ways to overturn the 2020 election and encouraging supporters to march on the Capitol. He has expressed alarm to associates about repeated defeats in court as he seeks to stop the select committee obtaining some of the most sensitive of White House documents about 6 January from the National Archives, on grounds of executive privilege. The reality is that with each passing day, the committee seems to be gathering new evidence about Trump’s culpability around the Capitol attack that might culminate with recommendations for new election laws – but also for prosecutions. “I think that the justice department will keep a keen eye on what evidence the committee has accumulated, as well as looking out for witnesses for a potential case,” said Ryan Goodman, a former special counsel at the Department of Defense now a law professor at New York University. “One of the outcomes of the committee’s work and the public hearings will be to demonstrate individuals who might be wanting to come forward as witnesses and that’s got to be very important to justice department prosecutors,” Goodman said. House investigators are expected to soon surpass more than 300 interviews with Trump administration officials and Trump political operatives as part of a process that has yielded 30,000 documents and 250 tips via the select committee’s tip line. The flurry of recent revelations – such as the disclosure of Meadows’s connection to a powerpoint outlining how Trump could stage a coup, as first reported by the Guardian – raises the specter that the select committee is swiftly heading towards an incriminating conclusion. Trump’s associates insist they are not worried, at least for the moment, since the select committee has yet to obtain materials covered by executive privilege either through Meadows or the National Archives that could ensnare Trump personally. The former president’s defenders are correct in that respect – the committee does not have messages that show Trump directing an attack on the Capitol, one source said – and Trump has vowed to appeal the National Archives case to the supreme court. Related: House panel gathers mountain of evidence in Capitol attack investigation But no one outside the select committee, which is quietly making progress from a glass office on Capitol Hill with boarded-up windows and electronically secured doors, knows exactly what it has uncovered and whether the inquiry ends with a criminal referral. The material Meadows turned over alone depicts an alarming strategy to stop Biden’s certification on 6 January, involving nearly the entire federal government and lieutenants operating from the Willard hotel in Washington. One member on the select committee described the events around 6 January as showing a coalescence of multiple strategies: “There was a DoJ strategy, a state legislative strategy, a state election official strategy, the vice-president strategy. And there was the insurrection strategy.” The text messages Meadows received on his personal phone implicate Trump’s eldest son, Don Jr, and Republican members of Congress. Texts Meadows turned over to the committee might also be used by an enterprising prosecutor as evidence of criminal obstruction to stop a congressional proceeding if the White House knew election fraud claims to be lies but still used them to stop Biden’s certification. While Meadows never testified about the communications, a cadre of top Trump officials, from former acting national security adviser Keith Kellogg to Pence’s former chief of staff Marc Short, have moved to cooperate with House investigators. The trouble for Trump – and part of the source of his frustration, the sources said – is his inability, out of office, to wield the far-reaching power of the executive branch to affect the course of the inquiry. The limited success of strategies he hoped would stymie the committee – ordering aides to defy subpoenas or launching legal challenges to slow-walk the release White House records – has been jarring for Trump. “I think what he’s finding is that as the ex-president, he has a lot less authority than he did as president. But his playbook doesn’t work if he’s not president,” said Daniel Goldman, former lead counsel in the first House impeachment inquiry into Trump. In a reflection of dwindling legal avenues available to undercut the investigation, Trump has returned to launching attacks-by-emailed-statement on the select committee, stewing over his predicament and what he considers an investigation designed only to hurt him politically. “The Unselect Committee itself is Rigged, stacked with Never Trumpers, Republican enemies, and two disgraced RINOs, Cheney and Kinzinger, who couldn’t get elected ‘dog catcher’ in their districts,” Trump vented last month. Related: Trump tested positive for Covid few days before Biden debate, chief of staff says in new book In private, Trump is said to have reserved the brunt of his scorn for Meadows, furious with his former White House chief of staff for sharing sensitive communications on top of all the unflattering details about Trump included in his book this month. Trump’s associates, however, have focused more on questioning the legitimacy of the select committee and its composition, arguing the fact that the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, appointed both Republican members reduces the investigation to a partisan political endeavor. They also argue that none of the revelations to date – like the Guardian’s reporting on Trump’s call to the Willard hotel, during which he pressed operatives to stop Biden’s certification from taking place entirely – amounts to criminal wrongdoing. But in the meantime, Trump is left with little choice but to wait for the committee’s report. “The justice department seems to be more reactive than proactive,” Goodman said. “They might be waiting for the committee to wrap up its work to make criminal referrals.”",Politics/The Guardian,Why Trump appears deeply unnerved as Capitol attack investigation closes in,https://news.yahoo.com/why-trump-appears-deeply-unnerved-070048967.html
12/20/2021,"Right-wing provocateur Steve Bannon is going full-steam ahead with a plan to turn his criminal case into a one-man reconnaissance mission involving the White House, the Justice Department, and the Jan. 6 Committee, where he hopes to find anything that’ll smear Democrats who’ve come after him. Earlier this month, The Daily Beast laid out Bannon’s strategy to find any evidence that this is merely a political prosecution, or—as some have commented—generate enough suspicion to besmirch the whole thing. The DOJ cast the strategy as an underhanded ploy to harm the Jan. 6 Committee’s ongoing investigation into the causes of the insurrection by exposing its inner workings and witnesses who’ve secretly cooperated, and the gambit seemed to be stymied when the federal judge overseeing the case issued a protective order on Dec. 10 limiting what kinds of documents Bannon could make public. Not so fast. Bannon’s team is interpreting the judge’s order as a greenlight to dig into the Biden administration and expose what they find, according to a person familiar with Bannon’s case. “Was this a politically motivated prosecution? The communications will show that… we’re going to ask for specific documents,” said the source, who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity. “The judge will allow us behind the curtain.” The legal team plans to publicly file damning documents they get, the source said. What would be a cut-and-dry misdemeanor case could become an unwelcome peek into the Biden administration. “We’re not completely restricted,” the source said. Steve Bannon after an appearance at U.S. District Court in Washington last month. Jared Carter, a professor at Vermont Law School who reviewed the judge’s order on The Daily Beast’s behalf, said “it does create a place” for Bannon to start filing acquired documents in court and turn his prosecution into an all-out assault on those coming after him. “Clearly their strategy is: The best defense is a good offense. And what we're seeing is the defense team trying to employ that strategy, trying to put the government and Biden administration on its heels,” Carter said. “That can be a very effective strategy.” Bannon’s game plan falls right in line with the comments he made on Nov. 15, the day he turned himself into the FBI and appeared in court. “We're taking down the Biden regime,” he said on his way into the FBI’s Washington field office. And on his way out of court a few hours later: “We’re gonna go on the offense. We’re tired of playing defense.” Roger Stone Stirs Up Old Feud, Suggests Steve Bannon 'Gave The Order' To Breach Capitol On Jan 6 Bannon’s claim that this is a political prosecution relies, in part, on remarks President Joe Biden made shortly after Marine One landed on the White House south lawn. When asked about Bannon and other witnesses who defied congressional subpoenas to testify, he said, “I hope that the committee goes after them and holds them accountable criminally.” When asked if the Justice Department should prosecute them, the president agreed. Here’s how Bannon tried to frame it back on that day in November: “Joe Biden ordered Merrick Garland to prosecute me from the White House lawn when he got off Marine One.” That’s a hefty accusation with no real evidence to back it up. But Trump’s former White House adviser plans to demand memos and internal communications at the White House, Justice Department, and Jan. 6 Committee to prove it. The point is to show that this entire prosecution was poisoned from the start. Bannon’s team is now mounting a defense to show that the Justice Department is engaging in “selective prosecution,” which legal scholars call a longshot strategy of proving that law enforcement discriminated against Bannon by singling him out. But this isn’t like the time the Drug Enforcement Administration was caught making 179 arrests over a decade in New York without a single white defendant. Legal scholars said Bannon isn’t being singled out because of his race or gender, so he doesn’t fit into what’s considered a protected class. Only three Jan. 6 Committee witnesses have refused to testify. And while only Bannon has been criminally charged, Congress has already referred former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows to the Justice Department for prosecution—and ex-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark might not be too far behind. Congress has already referred former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows to the Justice Department for prosecution. “They have to prove that in insurrection cases held by this DOJ they've chosen not to go forward. But Bannon and Meadows are the only ones saying they’re not going to do it. The selective prosecution model fails,” said Joshua E. Kastenberg, a professor at University of New Mexico’s law school. Legal scholars also said Bannon’s mission for embarrassing memos borders on what they call “discovery abuse,” when one side uses a court battle to make unreasonable requests for evidence. ""You can't just say we want this memo or that memo. You have to present some evidence these memos exist. You can't base your discovery demand on conjecture,” Kastenberg said. David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said the judge should severely limit this case to its core premise: Bannon got a subpoena to testify, and he didn’t show up. “A court shouldn't grant these discovery requests whatsoever. And even if they did, they shouldn't affect the outcome. All of this is really the sideshow,” Schultz said. The battle over how far Bannon’s team can reach into the filing cabinets at the White House and DOJ is expected to play out in the coming weeks, as Bannon’s case is on a fast-track to a trial set in July 2022. And while U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols set limits on what they could do with sensitive government documents—they have to be redacted and relevant to the case—Bannon’s legal team plans to show how the government singled out Trump’s one-time campaign chief. Anything they find could be made public soon. In recent court filings, Bannon lawyer M. Evan Corcoran indicated plans to use what they find to try to dismiss the case before it ever goes to trial. In one filing, he wrote that his team plans to “raise historically important constitutional issues.” It’s set to be a bitter fight all the way. While Bannon uses his War Room Pandemic daily podcast to cast the Biden presidency as illegitimate and call for “4,000 shock troops” to take back command of the U.S. government, his attorneys are throwing wrenches into the DOJ’s gears every chance they get. Both sides can’t even agree to deadlines in the months ahead, filings show. In one snippy email Thursday morning, Corcoran lectured a federal prosecutor about how “this is not a high school homework assignment.” “What Bannon is trying to do is make this into a bigger political issue,” Schultz said. “Maybe his attorneys know he's got a losing case, therefore, distract the media and public and make him into a political persecution. Maybe it's part of a martyr strategy.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!
