2/2/2022,"West Brom have sacked Valérien Ismaël as their head coach, little more than seven months after paying compensation to take him from Barnsley. Ismaël, appointed on 24 June, departs with the club fifth in the Championship, eight points off the second automatic promotion spot. They have lost three of their past four matches and have recorded one win in their past eight games.  West Brom supporters have been critical of results and the team’s direct style under Ismaël. The Frenchman guided Barnsley to fifth in the Championship last season, after taking over in October 2020 with the club 21st. “West Bromwich Albion Football Club can confirm Valérien Ismaël has today left his position as head coach,” a statement said. “Assistant head coach Adam Murray has also departed.”  More details to follow …",Sport/Football,Valérien Ismaël sacked as West Brom head coach after just over seven months,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/valerien-ismael-sacked-as-west-brom-head-coach-after-just-over-seven-months
2/2/2022,"The landlord run by billionaire Guy Hands’ private equity firm has issued the government a two-week ultimatum to drop legal action to take over 38,000 homes for military families and instead accept a one-off refurbishment payment of £105m. The Ministry of Defence revealed last week it planned to bring the properties back under government control, 25 years after a privatisation deal that has been criticised by the National Audit Office, the government’s spending watchdog, as a waste of taxpayers’ money.  The landlord Annington’s offer would represent less than £2,800 per property, a figure that is thought to be unlikely to cover the costs of extensive repairs in some of the more dilapidated homes – and is lower than the MoD’s £140m spending on maintenance for a single year. It would also represent just over an eighth of what Annington paid out in a dividend to its parent company last year. Lady Liddell, the Labour peer who chairs Annington, blamed the government’s Defence Infrastructure Organisation for failing to maintain the homes. She said her company, which owns 200-year leases on the properties, was “generously offering to put this right”. In a letter sent on Tuesday evening to the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and defence procurement minister Jeremy Quin, Annington described the government’s attitude as “decidedly anti-business” and demanded the government take the deal and withdraw its legal action, or face a protracted court fight. “It would be a shame to see money that could go to improving the houses being wasted on costly and lengthy legal action,” Liddell wrote. In 1996, the Conservative government sold 57,400 properties in the so-called “married quarters estate” to Annington Homes, which was then bought for £1.7bn by Nomura, a Japanese investment bank that employed Hands. He later left Nomura to found the Terra Firma private equity firm, and bought Annington for £3.2bn in 2012. The MoD then rented back the homes on a 200-year lease at a discount, but also agreed to pay for their maintenance and refurbishment. The value of the properties has since surged to an estimated £7.6bn last year, leaving its private equity owners with an enormous paper profit. Yet the MoD is still paying about £180m a year in rent plus £140m in repairs and upgrades, despite taking back ownership of part of the portfolio. Annington insists it has offered to take on the maintenance, although it has not shared the financial terms of any offer. The valuable income stream backed by the portfolio has helped Annington to raise billions of pounds from investors in bond issues. That included an £800m debt issue in October, which allowed it to pay a dividend of £794m to its parent company. The government is seeking to exercise “statutory leasehold enfranchisement rights”, Quin told parliament last week. The MoD has sought to take back only two houses at first as test cases to see if Annington can be forced out. Annington claims the government has no right to do so. “I think the approach the government is taking is very interesting and clever,” said David Burns, a senior litigation partner at Ronald Fletcher Baker, a law firm. “By serving just two claims in the first instance, it has limited the cost and risks to a certain extent as it seeks to exercise rights of enfranchisement and gain control of a large stock of housing at a good price.” Liddell said: “We believe this significant pot of money would go a long way towards bringing service family accommodation into the 21st century. “The money that the government intends to spend on misguided attempts to enfranchise Annington properties is far better spent on desperately needed improvements to these service homes.” A spokesman for the UK government’s investment arm declined to comment.",News/UK news,MoD given ultimatum to drop legal action against firm run by billionaire,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/mod-given-ultimatum-to-drop-legal-action-against-firm-run-by-billionaire
2/2/2022,"A gynaecologist in the Netherlands conceived 21 children and potentially dozens more using his own sperm after prospective parents turned to him for fertility treatment, an investigation has discovered. Jos Beek worked at Elisabeth hospital in Leiderdorp, now part of Alrijne hospital, between 1973 and 1998. He died in 2019.  The couples being treated by Beek had expected to be the beneficiaries of samples from anonymous sperm donors. Alrijne hospital said it does not believe Beek had told anyone the truth. The scandal emerged after an organisation that traces biological parents for those born using anonymous donations found a match between Beek’s DNA and 21 children whose mothers had received treatment at his clinic between 1973 and 1986. The group, Fiom, contacted Alrijne hospital in June last year. The hospital then commissioned an independent committee to investigate at the beginning of January. Peter Jue, a member of the board of directors at Alrijne hospital, said he could not discount the possibility that Beek was the biological father of many more children after treating their mothers. Jue said: “We are very shocked by this. This, of course, has a significant impact on the parents and children involved. “We immediately entered into a conversation with the children and parents who wanted to, to listen and to promise our cooperation. We recognise the situation they have found themselves in and want to do as much as possible to get information on the table. The way this doctor acted at the time is unacceptable.” Hospital records from the period no longer exist, so a general appeal has been made for people to come forward. Beek is the third fertility doctor in the Netherlands found to have used their own sperm during fertility treatment. In October 2020, DNA tests revealed that gynaecologist Jan Wildschut, who died in 2009, was the biological father of 17 children. The previous year it was discovered that doctor Jan Karbaat had used his own sperm in the conception of 49 children with unknowing patients. Jue said the protocols of the 1970s and 1980s, when fertility treatment was in its infancy, did not bear any relation to those of today. In a statement the hospital said: “It seems that this doctor donated his own sperm and used it to inseminate intended mothers who were expecting sperm anonymously. “In the years that this doctor was working, there were hardly any regulations regarding fertility programmes. The field was still developing. “We would like to emphasise that the situation is now completely different. We use national protocols and work in a consistent and careful manner. Our working method is regularly checked through audits.” Under a law that came into force in 2004, people in the Netherlands have the right to know the identity of their biological parents once they reach the age of 16.",News/World news,Netherlands fertility doctor used own sperm to father 21 children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/netherlands-fertility-doctor-jos-beek-father-21-children
2/2/2022,"Security guards, cleaners and hospitality staff at Dubai’s Expo 2020 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are allegedly working in highly abusive conditions that may amount to forced labour, according to a human rights group. Migrant workers employed at the international fair in the UAE – taking place now after being delayed by Covid – allege they have been forced to pay illegal recruitment fees, suffered racial discrimination and had wages withheld and passports confiscated, said the report by Equidem.  Dubbed the “world’s greatest show”, Expo 2020 hosts 192 national pavilions, showcasing the latest ideas in technology and sustainability. Organisers hope to see 25 million visitors during the course of the fair, which opened in October 2021 and runs to March 2022. The event has attracted big corporate sponsors, global stars such as will.i.am and social media influencers, with visitors promised the “next wave of human brilliance”. But Equidem’s report highlighted the, “significant disconnect between the Emirate’s stated ambition of being a modern, international state and the reality of racial discrimination and forced labour practices that migrant workers are facing”. It said the UAE’s alleged failure to protect migrant workers damages the reputation of countries and companies taking part in the event. Equidem’s director, Mustafa Qadri, said: “The entire international community is complicit in the exploitation at the Expo. It’s a scandal.” Migrant workers, predominantly from the Indian subcontinent and parts of Africa, make up more than 90% of workers in the UAE’s private sector. More than half the 69 workers interviewed for the report said they had paid recruitment fees in their own countries to secure their jobs. Many claimed their employers were aware of this practice but failed to intervene or reimburse the fees. The practice, which is illegal in the UAE, often leaves workers deep in debt. Two-thirds of the migrant workers interviewed said their wages or other benefits were not always paid on time or in full, leaving some struggling to pay for food or send money home to their families. “They promised me an increment in salary after probation – something I have not seen to date … Never have I received overtime payment from my employer … The way they treat the staff is like slaves, I mean modern-day slavery,” said one hospitality worker. Virtually all workers said their passports were held by their employer. While most said they could get them back on request, the practice is illegal and can be used by some companies to control their workforce. One worker said his employer kept his passport, despite instructions from Expo’s management to return workers’ passports. He said: “The company made us sign a paper saying we have received our passport. In reality, it is still in the office of our accommodation camp.” While there was some evidence that working conditions at the Expo were generally better than elsewhere in the UAE, the findings allegedly revealed multiple breaches of the Emirate’s labour laws, as well as the more stringent worker welfare standards introduced to protect the rights of workers employed in constructing the event and providing security and hospitality services. The UAE authorities and participating nations have been repeatedly warned of the risks of labour abuse at the Expo. On the eve of its official opening, in September 2021, the European parliament passed a resolution calling on international companies sponsoring the event to withdraw and a boycott by member states, citing human rights abuses in the UAE, including the detention of activist Ahmed Mansoor and the “pervasive” abuse of migrant workers. The Arab parliament dismissed the claims. In a statement, it said: “The UAE is one of the leading countries with regards to human rights.” In October, Human Rights Watch described the Expo as an opportunity, “for the UAE to falsely present itself on the world stage as open, tolerant, and rights-respecting while shutting down the space for politics, public discourse, and activism”. The rights group urged governments and businesses, “to avoid contributing to UAE authorities’ efforts to whitewash its abuses”. The UAE authorities and Expo 2020 did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A statement on the Expo 2020 website reads: “We are committed to the health, safety, welfare and dignity of all workers.” It claims workers’ welfare standards are monitored through regular inspections of working and living conditions.",News/Global development,Allegations of worker exploitation at ‘world’s greatest show’ in Dubai,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/02/allegations-of-worker-exploitation-at-worlds-greatest-show-expo-2020-dubai
2/2/2022,"When your teen hits puberty, their brain changes dramatically. The ‘teenage brain’ is unique, it is a time of dramatic brain growth and unparalleled learning opportunity. Precisely because the brain is acutely responsive to the environment, it is also a time of potential vulnerability. As the parent of a teen, it means you have to shift gear so that you can make the most of this extraordinary time. Rather than take a step back, parents of teens need to stay close, but your strategy needs to change according to their stage in life. Think of it as tracking them at a respectful distance. Here we outline 4 practical science-based tips that if used consistently through the teenage years, will improve your teen’s life trajectory and well-being.  The teenage brain shifts gear in puberty, to ensure adolescents explore, engage and notice the world in a unique way. These priorities are an evolutionary masterstroke, because they allow the young person to prepare for adulthood and independence. For example, teens need to find their future tribe, and so their brain zeros in on their peer group and is highly attuned to acceptance and integration because that same peer group is their future community. Teen brains are wired to look out for novel experiences and take risks and this means that they learn about their environment, its costs and benefits. Their brain is driven to independence and so they often reject parents’ ideals and philosophy as part of separating from the family. One aspect of the adolescent years that is often misunderstood is the intense emotions that young people feel and express. Neuroscience considers emotions as a way of learning about the world and teens need to learn efficiently in preparation for adulthood, so accordingly the intensity of their emotions is heightened. Use this framework, and you can work with biology rather than against it. For example, capitalize on the pull towards peers and set up study groups, reframe rejection of familiar family ideas as a step towards healthy separation. Knowing the science helps parents and can shift perception to see these behaviours as necessary and adaptive rather than rejecting and disrespectful, enabling greater compassion and understanding. Teens need experiences that provide choice and where they can exercise autonomy. This means relationships with parents need to change, in particular the way you deliver your parenting. Young people have an intense need to feel respected so a consultation model works best. So, listen more and talk less and develop a problem-solving strategy together. Part of the strategy includes consciously supporting them towards independence. It’s hard to watch our kids struggle but saving them from the natural consequences of life does not work long-term. Instead of finishing their homework for them when they are tired, you may need to allow them to explore the consequences of that so that they learn key life skills. That way they experience and develop resilience, self-confidence and a sense of autonomy. Teens will challenge authority and test boundaries as they are figuring out who they are and how they want to live. Good communication and deep curiosity are the key to managing this. Boundary testing is usually a highly emotional time for everyone involved. When their behaviour has gone haywire and they have a meltdown, your job is to try to find out what’s really going on. Shouting at them simply escalates things and is never a good idea, but neither changing your approach nor caving in the face of their intense emotions is helpful either. Stay with them during the intense emotion (it will help them calm down) but don’t try and negotiate while emotions are running high, they won’t be able to hear you while their brain is in an intensely emotional state. Stay strong and talk it through at a calm time. This might be hours or even days later. Listen to them, be genuinely curious about their perspective, potential triggers for the meltdown, make time for conversation where emotions can be discussed, and difficulties worked through. Finding a resolution and working through these tough times is where the magic of teenage parenting happens. Doing this will help teens learn how to manage their own emotions and boundaries appropriately. Both are essential life skills. Teens need their parents, even if they push you away in the moment. These years are bewildering times for them, with many practical and emotional hurdles to overcome. They need a stable, predictable and nurturing environment at home, even though it is precisely the same period of life when confrontations at home are frequent. Parents need to give them space and hold them tight at the same time (no one said it was easy). The linchpin here is a strong relationship. Studies show that a strong, warm and nurturing parental relationship can impact brain function so that teens can negotiate the challenging times of life while protecting them from potential mental health problems further down the line. The teenage years can be challenging for everyone in the family, but neuroscience has lifted the lid on adolescence to help you understand and connect with your teen, and with that comes the key to unlocking the potential of the incredible teenage brain.Learn more about the teenage brain at the upcoming masterclass, taking place on Tuesday 1 March 2022.

2/2/2022,"A man who led police on a 24-hour manhunt after killing his ex-partner and her son has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 40 years. Daniel Boulton, 30, stabbed and killed Bethany Vincent, 26, and her nine-year-old son Darren Henson, known as DJ, at their home in Louth, Lincolnshire, in May last year.  At the sentencing hearing at Lincoln crown court on Wednesday, the judge, Mr Justice Pepperall, said: “I’m sure that you targeted DJ because of your hatred and you were motivated by his autism. I’m sure that you are a violent and very dangerous man, and you present an ongoing risk of further violence, and possibly even homicide. “You killed with ruthless efficiency very soon after breaking into the house. You acted calmly, callously and efficiently … you intended to kill, you knew precisely what you were doing.” Boulton pleaded guilty to manslaughter midtrial at Lincoln crown court but denied murder, claiming he had a mental health condition at the time. Jurors took less than 60 minutes to convict him of both murders, and there were shouts of “yes” from the public gallery as the verdicts were read out. During the three-week trial, the court heard how Boulton walked 28 miles from his hostel in Skegness to Vincent’s house, where he stabbed her nine times. He then went up to DJ’s bedroom and stabbed the boy 14 times. A nine-month-old baby was found at the house when emergency services arrived at the scene Boulton went on the run and the following day he assaulted an off-duty officer, PC Stephen Dennis, who tried to detain him while walking his dog near Hubbard’s Hills. Boulton was eventually cornered on a farm and armed officers used stun guns on him. Jurors were told that Boulton had developed a hatred for DJ, who was severely autistic, and he had spoken of how he wanted to wipe out Vincent’s “whole bloodline”. He was prevented from seeing Vincent by a restraining order issued after a previous incident in which he “threw her around the house”, the court heard. However, he continued to contact her and sent her more than 900 messages the weekend before the stabbings, jurors were told. The defence claimed Boulton was on “autopilot” at the time of the murders and had a “loss of control”. Experts said the defendant had a dissocial personality disorder, but the prosecutor, Kath Goddard QC, said Boulton had been “fully in control” of his actions.

2/2/2022,"In a month of spectacular video game industry buyouts, symbolised by Microsoft’s incredible $68bn swoop for Activision Blizzard, there is one purchase that has sent paroxysms of fear across the planet. On Monday, the New York Times revealed that it had bought the viral megahit Wordle for a “low seven figure sum”. The web-based word puzzle, which launched in October, was originally intended as a gift from software engineer Josh Wardle to his partner. But it has become a viral sensation, amassing an audience of millions – and key to its appeal is the fact that it’s free, with no ads. So what does a big newspaper like the New York Times want with a game like Wordle, and what happens next?  In its announcement, the NYT said Wordle would “initially” remain free to current and new users. That doesn’t mean that Wordle will never be locked behind a paywall, but for now it won’t – and bear in mind that the NYT currently lets nonsubscribers play some of its other games and crosswords for free. “It’s a little early for us to talk about where we might go with the game,” says the NYT’s general manager of games, Jonathan Knight. “Our number one objective is to continue what makes this game so special – I think in that regard we are more like stewards at the beginning. I think we have a good sense of why it’s so popular and we’re committed to maintaining that game design.” Those worried about the game being suddenly plastered with ads can probably relax, too. The NYT’s own games, as well as the Wordle page and app, are all reassuringly stylish; there’s an Apple-like concern with cleanliness and uniformity in both the visual design and the user experience. “We have a fairly minimalist design to our games,” says Knight. “We make elegant visual puzzles. Josh has said publicly that he was inspired by our games – he and his partner play Spelling Bee.” So why would the NYT pay a seven-figure sum for something that it’s not going to directly monetise? “Our number one priority is around users and engagement,” says Knight. “Our strategy is to have more people spending more time with the Times – both the news and our products around the news, whether thats games or cooking or audio or [product review site] Wirecutter. Clearly Wordle has created a huge daily engagement phenomenon and we see intrinsic value in that. So the first order of business is really to bring it on to the NYT site, introduce our audience to Wordle, and Wordle’s audience to the New York Times, and go from there.” There’s an important piece of background here that non-NYT subscribers might not realise: this newspaper is extremely serious about games. Alongside a daily crossword and sudoku, it has Tiles, Spelling Bee, Vertex, Letter Boxed and Mini Crossword – all interesting, smart and highly acclaimed, and all designed by the paper’s dedicated games team, which is effectively run as a development studio. Ideas are brainstormed then prototyped and tested over many months, and several designers are graduates of the NYU Game Center, the groundbreaking game design school that has become the industry’s equivalent of Central St Martins. This is something Knight, who has previously run studios for Electronic Arts and Zynga, is keen to emphasise. “We have a set of creative pillars for our games – we want them to feel like time well spent, they should fit well into your day, we like that we’re all collectively working on the same human-made puzzle at the same time and trying to get to the same solution – we think that’s really important. Our games are about mental challenge and mental fitness and staying sharp – what you might call smart fun.” It’s safe to assume they’re not in this for a quick buck. According to Knight, the NYT made contact with Wardle at the beginning of January, when the game was still early in its ascent. “I’ve long admired The Times’s approach to the quality of their games and the respect with which they treat their players,” Wardle said in the press release announcing the sale. “Their values are aligned with mine on these matters and I’m thrilled that they will be stewards of the game moving forward.” According to Knight, the paper, which has been running a crossword since 1942, has always understood the value of games as part of the news package. “We get incredible letters from our players and fans, heartfelt messages about people who solved a crossword with their elderly parents – even in times of tragedy, word games are the things that kept people together until the very end … [During the pandemic] we’ve all spent a lot of time indoors with each other and we feel like our games have brought a lot of joy to people. We see that in the business, too – games have really grown in popularity over the last couple of years.” The NYT games team was inspired by Wordle, Knight says, especially the spoiler-free way that it lets players share the solution on social media, with rows of coloured squares. “What I love, is that the little grid of green and yellow squares is actually a story, a personal and unique story, about how you solved the puzzle that day. And you can share that story without giving away the ending – so if I haven’t solved it yet that day, I can still enjoy that story; and once I have solved it I can sort of pick apart your story,” says Knight. “It’s really magical that way. Today I was on Facebook with some friends and someone posted a grid I’d just never seen before – so it’s a story that doesn’t seem to get old. It’s a very clever, innovative sharing mechanic at a time when people really need that.” Expecting Wardle to maintain control of his game as it became a global phenomenon was always unrealistic. In 2014, game developer Dong Nguyen was so traumatised by the demands of maintaining his viral megahit Flappy Bird that he took the game off app stores and apologised for its supposedly addictive qualities. For Wordle, stewardship at the NYT is a best case scenario. This way, the game will exist on a stable platform with a team on-hand for technical updates – and Wardle gets to benefit from what he’s created without ruining it. And if you’re worried about losing your winning streak data in the move, it’s OK. An NYT spokesperson told me: “Josh Wardle is working with us to make sure streaks and stats will work as they have to date.” Phew.",Arts/Games,Will Wordle remain free after the New York Times buyout?,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/02/will-wordle-remain-free-new-york-times-buyout-paywall-ads
2/2/2022,"The star of Woody Allen’s latest film has defended the director against a persistent accusation he molested his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, in 1992. Allen has always denied the allegation and two investigations into the case resulted in no charges being brought. Wallace Shawn, who has featured in The Princess Bride, Clueless and six films by Allen, has written an open letter explaining his reasoning for believing that Allen was innocent, and admonishing other actors who have “distanced themselves” from him.  “I was very upset that some of my fellow actors leapt to the conclusion that Woody was guilty of a serious crime that you can go to prison for without really knowing that much about it,” Shawn told Yahoo Movies. “Of course, if someone like [Dylan] says ‘This happened to me,’ I don’t fault people for thinking: ‘That might be true.’ But on the other hand, Woody said, ‘That didn’t happen,’ and I didn’t care for the fact that so many of my fellow actors didn’t look into it any farther, and just assumed he was guilty. “I’ve followed the case: I’ve read quite a bit about it, I saw the documentary trying to substantiate Dylan’s story and I don’t believe that this happened.” Farrow restated her accusation in an open letter to the New York Times in 2014, in the wake of the acclaim for Allen’s Oscar-winning drama Blue Jasmine. Her brother, Ronan, resurfaced the claims in 2016, coinciding with the Cannes premiere of Allen’s comedy Café Society. A documentary on HBO last year presented the case from the points of view of Dylan, Ronan and their mother, Mia Farrow. A number of stars with whom Allen, 86, has worked have expressed regret for their collaborations. In 2016, Selena Gomez and Timothée Chalamet donated their fees from romantic comedy A Rainy Day in New York to #MeToo. Kate Winslet, Rebecca Hall, Colin Firth, Rachel Brosnahan and Michael Caine are among those who have said they would no longer work with Allen. However, stars including Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem, Larry David, Alec Baldwin, Diane Keaton, Blake Lively, Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart have defended the director. Shawn said he felt the prevailing assumption that Allen was guilty was “a miscarriage of justice”. “I hope that the more of us who stick our neck out and say, ‘You must not jump to that conclusion,’ it will become easier for more people to say that,” said Shawn. “At the moment, people’s agents tell them to denounce Woody and to not work with him. If more people – like Scarlett Johansson and Dianne Wiest – say, ‘We’re delighted to work with him,’ then maybe eventually the tide will turn.” Shawn stars alongside Gina Gershon, Christoph Waltz and Louis Garrel in Rifkin’s Festival, which opened to muted domestic box office last weekend. The film made $24,000 from 26 cinemas across the US. Allen’s previous film, A Rainy Day in New York, was a surprise commercial hit, despite the negative publicity surrounding Chalamet’s and Gomez’s statements, and Amazon dropping the film and their multi-picture deal with Allen, who later filed a $68m suit for breach of contract. That film made $22m worldwide in cinemas despite its mid-pandemic release, and broke streaming records. Allen remains one of the few directors who makes one film a year in their 80s. Details of a 50th film are still to be confirmed.",Arts/Film,Wallace Shawn calls backlash against Woody Allen ‘a miscarriage of justice’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/02/wallace-shawn-woody-allen-miscarriage-of-justice
