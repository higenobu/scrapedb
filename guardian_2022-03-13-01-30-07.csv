3/13/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been described by politicians and commentators as a watershed moment in modern history, a turning point comparable in importance to the 9/11 attacks in the US in 2001, the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and even the assassination of John F Kennedy in 1963. Whether this portentous view of the war turns out to be justified, only time – and future historians – will tell. But there’s no doubt that in the violent, tumultuous days after 24 February, the established international order has been shaken and, in some respects, upended in extraordinary, unexpected and often unwelcome ways. Ukraine – a country at the crossroads of Europe and Asia that is little known and often ignored – has become overnight the crucible of a new world order, a catalyst and trigger for radical upheaval. It has produced a new geopolitical alphabet, spelling out a much-altered future. Atomic weapons Vladimir Putin’s ill-disguised threat to go nuclear should the west intervene to halt the invasion has come scarily close to breaking a post-1945 taboo. It has undoubtedly inhibited the US and British response, with fears expressed about a “third world war”. A dangerous precedent has been set. Joe Biden’s tenure as US president may be fatally undermined by the war. He is praised for avoiding direct military confrontation with Russia. But as in Afghanistan last year, he has failed to prevent a humanitarian disaster – or stop Putin. Anger over resulting domestic energy price rises and retail inflation could be his undoing. China stands to be the big strategic winner if, as seems likely, Ukraine becomes a protracted trial of strength between Russia and the west. Its president, Xi Jinping, appears to have given Putin a green light when they met just before the invasion. Now he’s backing peace efforts. China’s economy has been hurt by rising commodity costs. But it’s a small price to pay for increased global dominance. Disinformation used as a weapon of war, particularly in the form of “false flag” operations, invented social media “facts”, and internet bots, has come of age in the Ukraine conflict. When coupled with cyber warfare, propaganda, media manipulation and rigid censorship, as in Russia, it’s a potent means of sowing doubt, division and defeatism. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s unpopular authoritarian president and serial invader of Syria and Iraq, is one of several unlikely would-be peacemakers. Erdoğan has bought missiles from Russia, sold drones to Ukraine, and his country belongs to Nato. Perhaps that’s why no one trusts him. High-level talks last week in Turkey were a Russian time-wasting exercise. But by hosting them, Erdoğan hopes for a boost before difficult elections next year. France’s Emmanuel Macron appears to have added critical impetus to his presidential re-election bid next month through his dogged efforts to keep Putin engaged in some sort of dialogue. In contrast, far-right hopefuls Marine Le Pen and Eric Zemmour have been forced to defend their Russian ties. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz shocked friends and enemies alike shortly after the invasion by suspending the highly prized Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia and creating an £85bn fund to boost the country’s armed forces. For the first time since the Nazi era, Germany has begun to re-arm – and Europe cheered. Extraordinary. Hunger, and consequent political unrest, affecting poorer countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia is a growing fear as Ukraine’s and Russia’s wheat, grain and vegetable oil exports are cut off. In Tunisia, symbolic birthplace of the Arab spring revolts, bread prices recently hit an unsustainable 14-year high. Israel has disappointed its friends with its invasion fence-sitting, ostensibly justified by a need to keep on terms with Russia in Syria. But its rightwing government will be happy if the war scuppers the west’s proposed revived nuclear deal with Iran, to which the ever devious Putin has suddenly raised fresh objections. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, was on the ropes and almost out for the count in the days before the invasion, vilified for illegal Downing Street partying in breach of Covid lockdown rules. But the war, allowing him to play international statesman, has provided a new lease of political life – for now. Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave squeezed between Poland and Lithuania, and the three (former Soviet) Baltic republics are emerging as possible next flashpoints. Fabricated fears about the safety of ethnic Russians in Estonia, for example, have been used in the past to justify Putin’s threats, just like in Ukraine. Now they are being whipped up again. International law has taken a battering from which it may not recover. By its actions, Russia has torn up the UN charter. Yet the UN security council is powerless to act in the face of Moscow’s permanent veto power – which it used to block a resolution condemning the invasion. Russia also boycotted a hearing on Ukraine at the UN’s highest court, the international court of justice in The Hague. UN reform must come soon. Emmanuel Macron’s oft-mocked vision of a sovereign Europe that enjoys “strategic autonomy” and its own military and security capabilities independent of the US has been boosted by the war. Rattled EU leaders meeting at last week’s Versailles summit agreed Europe urgently needed to be better able to defend itself. Nato has emerged united and stronger, so far, and there is talk of Finland and Sweden joining (though not Ukraine). But the 30-country, US-led alliance is facing criticism for not doing more to help Kyiv. And the war has revived debate over whether Nato’s eastward enlargement after the Soviet collapse was a blunder that contributed to the current crisis. Oil and gas are fatal chinks in western armour when confronting Russia. The US and Britain decided last week to ban all oil imports by year’s end. The heavily dependent EU needs more time. But rocketing prices, hitting businesses and consumers, have dramatised how hugely powerful a weapon energy is for Putin. A race to find badly needed “green” and nuclear alternatives has begun. Playing and watching international sport has got a lot harder – if you are Russian. The country’s athletes, footballers, and racing drivers are among sportspeople banned from European and world competitions. Boycotts have a cultural aspect, too, involving ballet, theatre, orchestras and even cat lovers. Such unprecedented “virtue signalling” may backfire, by convincing ordinary Russians that they, not just their government, are being targeted. The quest for truth – the fundamental purpose of free, independent media – has been further set back by the war. Russia has long persecuted western correspondents. Now it is threatening them with prison if they report openly on the invasion. Facebook and Twitter have been blocked. The EU, in turn, has banned Russian state-backed RT and Sputnik, deeming them mere propaganda outlets. The concept of the freedom of the press is under siege. Record refugee outflows, and an accompanying humanitarian crisis, may overwhelm the ability of EU governments and relief agencies to cope. More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled so far, from a population of 44 million. Europe opened its borders amid an epic outpouring of public support. But the EU’s longstanding lack of an agreed, collective refugee policy, and Britain’s shamefully mean-spirited response, suggest trouble ahead as the numbers grow. Sanctions on Russia are the most sweeping and punitive ever imposed. Banks, including Russia’s central bank, businesses and oligarchs have been hit hard. The rouble has plunged. Numerous western brands and companies such as Shell have pulled out. So far Putin has shrugged it off, but this looks like a bluff. If Russia defaults, or retaliates by cutting gas supplies to Europe, the result may be an all-round economic meltdown, big job losses, and a drastic fall in living standards in the UK and elsewhere. Taiwan has been watching events in Ukraine with deep unease. The US refusal to come to Kyiv’s aid with direct military support is especially chilling, given the invasion threat the island faces from Beijing. As with Ukraine, Washington has no legal or treaty obligation to fight for Taiwan. Its position is deliberately ambiguous – and inherently unreliable. China is watching, too. The United Arab Emirates is among several western allies in the Middle East and Asia that have failed to show hoped-for solidarity. The UAE has not condemned the invasion, nor has it adopted sanctions against Russia, with which it has close financial ties. Mealy mouthed Narendra Modi’s India, the “world’s largest democracy”, is another big disappointment, as is Egypt. These derelictions will not be forgotten, and may affect future ties. Venezuela’s hard-left government has been in America’s bad books for years. But when US officials visited recently to discuss resumed oil supplies in return for an easing of sanctions, they found a receptive audience. In contrast, when Joe Biden phoned the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (a keen Putin fan), requesting increased oil production to compensate for banned Russian exports, he refused to take the president’s call. US-Saudi relations have been in the toilet since Jamal Khashoggi’s 2018 murder. This incident will make matters worse. War crimes investigators face a big test as evidence mounts of multiple atrocities by Russian forces – exemplified by last week’s Mariupol maternity hospital bombing. “Universal jurisdiction” prosecutions are contemplated in national courts. And the international criminal court has begun investigations. But like the US and China, Russia does not recognise the ICC’s authority. This situation must change if war crimes are to be justly punished, now and in the future. Xinjiang, home to China’s persecuted Uyghur Muslim minority, is one of many global troublespots whose urgent problems have been eclipsed by Ukraine. Millions of Afghans enduring a winter of hunger and fear under Taliban rule suddenly seem forgotten. The plight of civilians caught up in Ethiopia’s civil war is another glaring blindspot. Younger generations the world over have reason to wonder what’s going on. First they inherited the climate crisis, then came the pandemic, and then the resultant bans on study and travel. Now they face something older generations said would never happen again: a full-scale war in Europe. “Z” is a fascist-style pro-war motif displayed by Russian invasion forces and rightwing Putin supporters. But the “Z” that will be remembered with admiration around the world belongs to the name of Volodymyr Zelenskiy Ukraine’s comedian president turned inspirational war leader, who embodies the fight for freedom.",News/World news,How Ukraine has become the crucible of the new world order,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/how-ukraine-has-become-the-crucible-of-the-new-world-order

3/13/2022,"“Why don’t we live here? Why did you ever leave?” This is Solomon, nine, one of my sons; and these are familiar questions he enjoys directing my way. We’ve just left Goodison Park, the ground of Everton, our football team; and we’re walking back to my parents’ home, not far away. Everton won the game (never a given, recently), and Solly is on a high; he wants to linger in the streets around Goodison, as he does whenever we visit. He likes all the ways the area is different from our home. That it’s rougher, not as pretty – poorer, to put it plainly – than our bourgeois patch of Kensal Green, in London, is all upside to him. He likes the shop we’ve just popped into for sweets with its Haribos behind caged wire like so much precious cargo. He likes the cheeky lads on their bikes, larking around as if auditioning for a documentary dedicated to “life on the street”. If it were a pal alongside me, I’d be teasing him for romanticising my old home, for taking a walk on the wild side. But it’s my boy and I can’t help but smile at how much he’s enjoying himself. Anyway, the blame, if blame is required, is mine. The football is a project that I went all in on. I wanted at least one of my sons to care as much as I care – for good or ill – about my team. Why? There are easy answers; answers that resemble the reasons why I want them to be into the Beatles or old Simpsons episodes – it makes life easier if your kids share your interests; there are fewer fights over what to watch on television, or play in the car. But in other ways, nurturing the football attachment is very different to nudging your child towards the Beatles/Simpsons. For a start, it’s not all about pleasure; or, to be more precise, you can’t guarantee pleasure. Most fans, even of those clubs more successful than ours has been recently, deal routinely with frustration and disappointment. The key difference – solemn as it might seem to the uninitiated – is that the attachment to the club has to do with belonging, with identity. As I followed my father, so Solomon, poor guy, would follow me. And maybe I tried harder because we were 200 miles away from the club’s home. He loved the idea of fierce allegiance and tribal division. He’d talk of classmates: “X was Tottenham,” “Y was Arsenal.” “Typical Arsenal”, he’d say, without entirely knowing what that meant, but he liked the sound of it; the chance to appraise. He liked, too, the opportunity for banter, for teasing, for rivalry. And he quickly picked up on the politics of fandom with its insistence on real commitment. He rehearsed the joke about one of his friends who changes his allegiance during the game itself, depending on who is winning. Not like him, he’d say: “Don’t worry, Dad, I’ll always be Everton, like you and Grandad.” (Evidently, he also loved the opportunity for melodramatic pronouncements.) What I hadn’t foreseen was how football would become a gateway to a deeper attachment, to place and family; in particular to the family’s history in Liverpool. For context, I should explain that Solomon doesn’t hear much in the way of scouse nostalgia around our house in London. In fact, you’d struggle to find anyone who had rushed more readily than I had, as a young adult, into embourgeoisement, as I later learned to call it – revelling in the exposed floorboards and bookcases of my new middle-classness. Did I want to join the ranks of those poncey metropolitan liberals? Yes please, if they’d have me. My son, however, a north London native, literally born on those exposed floorboards and already bouncing between his theatre trips and debating clubs, took a fancy to stepping back into my childhood – with its narrower options but, as he saw it, deeper seams. Walking to my parents’ from the ground, he finds it fascinating that there are links everywhere that connect to him: schools attended by his dad or grandmother or cousin; churches marked by family births, marriages and deaths; parks played in over generations. My lot has been in Liverpool for a century and more, since the forebears left Ireland; converging in particular on one street, where rented homes, then social housing, would be “inherited” over generations. This history – one place resonating with a family’s presence and memories over a long time – is not part of Solomon’s regular world. In his playground, there are almost as many different football shirts worn as there are children; his school pals’ parents come from all over Britain and way beyond. His own mother, my wife, is Canadian. His passion has an effect on me, too. As Solomon presses me to summon up memories of the passing buildings, I recognise how much I’ve begun to take from his interest in his “family gang”, as he calls it. Which catches me by surprise: over the past few years, the turn towards identity in the national conversation, I’ve found frustrating, limiting. It comes with an impulse to box people in. Do we really want to be defined by others, by where we were born, say, or by our ethnicity? Are we happy to settle for being a “citizen of anywhere” or “citizen of somewhere”? And yet here was my entirely unboxed hyphenate, our Liverpudlian-Canadian-Londoner, finding something deeply enticing and comforting in belonging – initially through football. He asks Grandad to tell him about old games, and together they watch recorded matches; the stories my dad tells of these bleed into others, beyond football – of school, of work, of what he and his friends did for fun; my mother now joining in. Some tales are well-worn, the “classics”: my dad’s childhood living in a pub, and the occasional naughty recycling of beer bottles from the yard so his friends could claim, then split, the deposit (it’s never too late to confess, Dad); my mother’s late teenage years in the Cavern during Merseybeat. But some are new to me: how much easier it is for a grandchild to ask. All the tales are fixed to places close by: where are those venues, those factories now, Solomon asks. Can we walk there, touch them, smell them? (We can, though the smells tend to change. No tobacco nor rum lingers in the air at the dockside warehouse, soon to be an apartment block, where my dad worked as a 16-year-old.) Why are we Everton, not Liverpool? And I’m reminded, as we walk him through the history, that the game, which served as a prompt to all the boy’s wider questions, can itself go deep. The answer, as it happens, is that while the founders of Liverpool FC were wrapped up in the Tory party and had strong links to the Orange order, the early Evertonian boards tended to be Liberal and would seduce the local Catholic electorate by presenting in favour of Home Rule for Ireland. My dad, educated by the Christian Brothers, landed on one side. There’s good fun to be had in reminding my Liverpool FC pals, especially those of a liberal bent, of this history. As Solomon drinks it all in, I have further reason to thank my nine-year-old sage, further reason to take pleasure in his enthusiasm. Accounts of neighbourhoods like the one I’d grown up in, home to my parents and our football club, can fall into a grim pattern. The problem is not in the documenting of social ills – of course not, that’s the job, our job. (And if levelling up ever proves to be more than a phrase, its purpose is surely to lend more options to those living in such areas.) But it’s the flatness of the lives depicted that can jar, the greyness – as if colour, vitality exists elsewhere. It’s there in the very idea of being “left behind”; there’s a clue in the phrase. The richness of lives is often missed; the richness formed by history, by memory, by place. It blows Solomon’s mind that our family – the sort of people now often used as the “solid”, “unchanging” contrast to the fluid, fast-changing world in which the boy grows up – were once migrants too, struggling to negotiate the ways of a new country, responding to huge change. And not that many generations ago; so close he can touch their birth certificates, hear about them, read about them. Maybe I’d forgotten a little of this richness myself, in my rush to be elsewhere. The boy, by contrast, hasn’t missed a thing. The boy done good.",Lifestyle/Life and style,My son’s passion for football has reawakened in me a deep sense of belonging,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/12/my-sons-passion-for-football-has-reawakened-in-me-a-deep-sense-of-belonging
3/13/2022,"A family trip to the theatre or an afternoon at a museum may be a fun day out, but new research suggests that such cultural outings will not actually help children secure higher grades. There have been persistent theories that wealthier children may be given an advantage in their school careers by being pressed into visits to art galleries and exhibitions. According to a new academic study, however, outings often regarded as “middle class” had no correlation with improved GCSE results. The findings emerge in a study examining the impact of “cultural capital” and its power to improve the life chances of children, as well as the extent to which it explains the persistent inequality experienced by children from richer or poorer backgrounds. While family cultural outings had no discernible impact, researchers did find that reading activities by both parents and their children played a role in exam grades. They measured activities such as reading for pleasure, visiting a library and discussing books at home. Such activities boosted GCSE scores by a significant amount. “Engaging in two or three reading activities, on average, increases the pupil’s GCSE score by between seven and nine points,” they found. “The size of this effect should not be overlooked since an extra GCSE pass at grade A* is worth eight points.” Researchers behind the study, due to appear in the British Journal of Sociology of Education, say it has real implications for ministers. The authors from the Universities of Sussex and Edinburgh said the concept of cultural capital “has become more prominent in government education policy”. They point to new guidance from Ofsted, stating that in assessing the quality of education at a school, “inspectors will consider the extent to which schools are equipping pupils with the knowledge and cultural capital they need to succeed in life”. “It is beguiling to believe that increasing pupils’ levels of cultural capital will have a positive influence on school GCSE outcomes,” the paper states. “It is tempting to theorise that visits to museums or historic venues might be helpful in igniting interests in history, and that visits to the theatre might similarly cultivate learning in drama. On deeper reflection, it is difficult to plausibly describe mechanisms by which the exposure to certain extracurricular activities would influence outcomes in other school GCSE subjects. “This study reports a set of empirical findings that do not lend any support to the view that increasing cultural capital will reduce the size of social class inequalities in school GCSE outcomes. This is not to argue that activities that have sometimes been associated with increasing cultural capital should not be part of the school experience – for example extracurricular trips may contribute to educational enjoyment.” Researchers used statistical models based on data from the Understanding Society survey, which documents the lives of households across Britain. They then linked this data to educational records held in the national pupil database. They examined “cultural capital” activities, as well as the reading activities, of both parents and their children to examine any links. Other studies have found that visiting museums, art galleries and theatres could have much broader benefits beyond education. One study by UCL academics concluded that they could actually lead to a longer life. The 2019 study found that the more often people engage with the arts, the lower their risk of premature death. It led to calls for cultural trips to be prescribed as a way of boosting wellbeing and supported studies that found regular cultural visits could improve depression, dementia, chronic pain and frailty.",News/Education,"Museum visits do not improve GCSE results, study reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/12/museum-visits-do-not-improve-gcse-results-study-reveals
3/13/2022,"In 2003, a guy called Benjamin Hoff, who was then employed as a tree-pruner in the Portland Japanese Garden in Oregon, published a charming little book, The Tao of Pooh, in which he argued that AA Milne’s bear had ways of doing things that appeared to echo some of the principles of Taoism, the ancient Chinese philosophy. Taoism teaches the various disciplines for achieving perfection through self-reflection, and one of its central concepts is that of pu – the idea that you should always be open to, but unburdened by, experience. The Tao of Pooh was a runaway success, spending 49 weeks on the New York Times’s bestseller list. This has given this newspaper columnist, whose occupation is even humbler than that of tree-pruner, an idea for a new, timely bestseller, the title of which – The Dao of Blockchain – neatly embodies two buzzwords for the price of one. Let me explain. A DAO is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation, defined by Wikipedia as “an organisation represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organisation members and not influenced by a central government, in other words they are member-owned communities without centralised leadership”. Or, in plain English, a new way of building enterprises that are democratically governed by a community of users. The novelty comes from the fact that DAOs are powered by the other obsession of the day, blockchains, distributed ledgers secured by cryptography. There is something quaint about the current hysteria around blockchains, in that they embody a touching belief that software will somehow provide a remedy for the untrustworthiness of people, institutions and government in our modern world. Still, DAOs rely on blockchains to securely hold the so-called “smart” (ie self-executing) contracts that codify the rules of the organisation – rules that can only be changed through voting mechanisms in which all members of the DAO can participate. So the computer code of the blockchain is the law governing the DAO, and since the code is supposed to be open-source, everyone can inspect it to see that no funny business is going on. To which the only sensible response is: really? Despite that, and a number of high-profile scandals and hacks, DAOs appear to be proliferating like rabbits. There are DAOs for (among other things) media, operating systems, “social” (whatever that means), protocols, collectors, services, investment and grants, etc. Not everyone is impressed by this Gadarene rush, however, chief among them financial regulators. Exhibit A in this context is American CryptoFed DAO, which bills itself as “a monetary system with zero inflation, zero deflation and zero transaction costs” and “the first Wyoming DAO”. According to the New York Times, “Just four months after the launch of American CryptoFed DAO, which planned to create a crypto payment system, the Securities and Exchange Commission in November effectively shut it down, saying the enterprise was ‘materially misleading’ the public with contradictory filings that failed to disclose key information such as audited financial statements.” Ah, those tiresome “audited financial statements”, those weary relics of the analogue world. In fact, reading the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ruling, it’s difficult to see how any DAO could actually meet the requirements of any financial regulator, anywhere, at the present time. There’s a lovely passage in the ruling that illustrates this. It reads: “The individuals and entities to whom American CryptoFed planned to distribute Locke tokens are not employees of American CryptoFed, as the Form 10 [a filing with the SEC] itself said that American CryptoFed will not have any employees but instead ‘will be operated automatically by smart contracts and direct voting by Locke tokens’.” The regulator and the regulated inhabit different legal universes. And yet there’s something touching about the DAO idea. It seeks to break the stranglehold of hierarchical organisations dominated by a few and replace them with more democratic structures. In that sense, they’re reminiscent of 1960s and 1970s attempts to create communes for breaking the grip of the nuclear monogamous family and creating more collegial structures for domestic life. Those experiments often broke up because the alpha males couldn’t hack real egalitarianism. And DAOs are now riven by similar conflicts. The only difference is that some members are more equal than other, not because of gender but because they own more of the cryptocurrency tokens and can therefore determine what happens. The more things change, the more they remain the same.

He’s one of a small but growing body of younger musicians keen to explore what he calls the “rich and melodic” work of the old songwriters. Bleach plays tenor, alto and soprano saxophones, plus clarinet, all with perfect control and a gorgeous tone, particularly on tenor. We have become so used to jazz treatments, sometimes quite brilliant ones, of standard tunes, that a straightforward rendition, elegantly phrased, comes as quite a surprise. The solos that follow maintain the mood and keep the melody in mind. Each track ends on a single long note – and when did you last hear one of those? No final flourishes, although Bleach does add a very small one at the end of the last number. Immaculate piano by Colin Good, direct from the 1930s, John Kelly (and guest Martin Wheatley) on guitar and Jim Ydstie, bass, complete the quartet.

3/13/2022,"The big western brands showed Vladimir Putin how to do it. While the Kremlin’s army was getting bogged down in Ukraine, Coca-Cola and Starbucks lost no time in closing their doors to Russian customers. But the most emblematic move of all came from McDonald’s, which has shut all 850 of its outlets in Russia. The availability of Big Macs in the Soviet Union was seen in 1990 as evidence that the west’s old cold war foe was turning its back on communism, but the past fortnight has rekindled memories of the bad old days. There were queues outside McDonald’s when it first opened in Moscow. Last week, Russians queued for one last burger before the pull-out began. One of Putin’s predecessors in the Kremlin – Lenin – once said there were decades when nothing happens and weeks when decades happen, and that’s true of the period since Russian troops moved across the border into Ukraine on 24 February. It is not just that Russia faces a brutal recession. It is the shattering of the idea of a seamless post-cold-war global economy. It is the return to days of higher defence spending in the west. It is the possibility that governments may backpedal on their net zero carbon pledges. “Putin has created his own worst nightmare,” says Mohamed El-Erian, chief economist at Allianz and president of Queens’ College, Cambridge. “He has united the west in a way it hasn’t been for a long time; he has been the catalyst for arms to Ukraine on a large scale; he has changed Germany’s approach to military spending; and he has brought the Russian economy to its knees. It is incredible.” Freezing the bulk of Russia’s reserves has meant the central bank has struggled to shore up the rouble, which has plummeted by a third on the currency markets. Capital controls have been introduced, interest rates have more than doubled, and annual inflation is heading for 20%. The stock market has been closed and financial markets fear Moscow may default on a sovereign debt repayment later this week. John Lough, an associate fellow of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, who in his previous role at Nato during the mid-1990s was the alliance’s first representative to be based in Moscow, says: “The middle classes are going to be very badly affected by the lack of access to foreign holidays, gadgets, and nice food – things they’re used to but are now going to dry up. Symbolism in politics and international relations is important. What does this signal? It signals ‘back to the USSR.’” Analysts warn of the sharpest annual decline for Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union, as the exodus of western capital, technology and knowhow draws a 21st-century iron curtain around the Russian economy. Bank of America forecasts a plunge in gross domestic product of 13% this year – a bigger hit than the pandemic or the 2008 financial crisis caused. The west’s sanctions have turned Putin’s Russia into a North Korea-style pariah state, but the tough measures will have consequences for a fragile global economy still recovering from Covid-19. It may only be the world’s 11th biggest economy, with a shrinking population and fewer links to global supply chains than China, but Russia’s status as the world’s biggest exporter of natural gas and the second-biggest exporter of crude oil means it punches above its weight. Russia accounts for just over a quarter of EU oil imports and 40% of gas, a figure rising to 65% in Germany and 100% in some eastern European states. For the US, the exposure is not so great.: it is the world’s biggest producer of oil, with a vast internal market, and just 7% of its oil imports come from Russia. For Germany, gas deliveries started in the late 1960s, as a product of the Ostpolitik agenda of former leader Willy Brandt, who wanted closer trade links between West Germany and the east as a way of overcoming tensions with the Soviet Union. Throughout her 16 years in power, Angela Merkel remained committed to imports, including the development of the now-halted Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany’s energy dependence only grew when the country scaled down nuclear production as part of coalition agreements between Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and the Greens. “This whole legacy of Ostpolitik has been turned on its head,” says Lough. “What we’re seeing now is going to be a transformation. The EU’s commitment to dramatically reduce energy dependence on Russia goes to the heart of it.” It is unlikely, though, to be a smooth process. With the world seeking alternative energy sources, commodity strategists at Bank of America estimate that less than half of Russian exports can be replaced by Iran, the Opec nations and US shale. Global crises in energy markets have form for upsetting the international economy, as well as triggering lasting change. The long postwar boom was brought to a head when action by the Opec cartel led to a quadrupling of crude oil prices in late 1973. There were echoes of that last week, when Brent crude rose above $130 a barrel, within sight of its record high of $147 a barrel, reached in 2008. El-Erian says there was a chance of stagflation – a combination of rapidly rising prices and weak growth – in the global economy even before the Russian invasion. “Now stagflation has become the baseline and a global recession has become the risk scenario,” he adds. Russia is no stranger to economic crises. The “shock treatment” administered by the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral bodies after the demise of the Soviet Union was brutal. Output fell consistently until the middle of the 1990s, unemployment peaked at almost 14%, and rising alcoholism and suicides led to a sharp fall in male life expectancy. A debt default in 1998 sent ripples through global financial markets, leading to the collapse of the US hedge fund Long Term Capital Management. The economy has been through three phases since the collapse of communism, according to Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank. An initial period of rapid but often disorderly change gave way to progress from the late 1990s onwards. Following other post-socialist countries, Russia started to build closer links with the wider European and global economy, helped by a surge in oil prices. In a third phase, global isolation has set in since the 2014 annexation of Crimea, pushing Moscow to focus on self-dependence and a “fortress Russia” economic policy to guard against western sanctions. The only problem, economists say, is that the road to autarky is rarely a recipe for sustained success. “Step by step, it is starting to resemble some features of the late Soviet Union of the Brezhnev era – an underperforming petro-economy with an oversized military sector,” says Schmieding. Away from oil, Russia is vital for rare earth minerals and agricultural products such as wheat, corn and sunflower oil. Together Russia and Ukraine account for a quarter of the world’s wheat exports; prices have surged by more than 50% as the breadbasket of the world grapples with war. Some developing countries will find they are paying the price. Russia supplies Egypt, with a population in excess of 100 million, with 85% of its wheat imports, while as much as 90% of Lebanon’s wheat and cooking oil imports come from Ukraine and Russia. For the UK, surging oil prices are already hitting motorists hard, driving pump prices of both unleaded petrol and diesel to record highs last week. Although the UK gets as little as 5% of its gas and 10% of its oil from Russia – meaning a phasing-out of supplies is unlikely to lead to shortages – soaring gas prices on wholesale markets will add to the cost-of-living squeeze. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is coming under pressure to boost support for households in his spring statement on 23 March. High inflation is expected to result in the biggest annual fall in living standards since at least the 1970s – costing the average household at least £1,000 a year – as pay fails to keep pace with prices. Gerard Lyons, chief economic strategist at the wealth management company Netwealth, says: “I don’t think a recession for the UK can be ruled out, even though it is not the most likely scenario.” Squeezing Putin’s financial power could encourage Russia to build closer ties with China. With the payments system, and central banks’ power to intervene in currency markets, snarled by sanctions, turning to the Chinese yuan and payment networks overseen by Beijing could prove attractive. However, experts believe there may be reluctance in both countries for a Sino-Russian pact. Pipelines and other infrastructure for large-scale exports of oil and gas eastwards are not in place, while there could be repercussions for Beijing if it helps Russia evade extensive and coordinated western sanctions. “They will be pushed closer to China, but that’s very uncomfortable for Russia without the balancing relationship with the west and access to western finance and technologies. That underlines the weakness of the Russian system,” says Lough. “My view is this will fatally undermine his position. He’s brought a form of destruction upon Russia because the economic impact is going to be so great. There is just no justification for it. It’s an extraordinary miscalculation.” And one with repercussions far beyond Russia.",News/Business,"Bye-bye to the Big Mac: Russia’s war heralds a dark, isolated economic era",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/bye-bye-to-the-big-mac-russias-war-heralds-a-dark-isolated-economic-era
3/13/2022,"A compelling Friday-night grapple with France resulted in a second successive narrow Six Nations defeat for Wales, leaving Wayne Pivac and his captain, Dan Biggar, to wonder what might have been. Wales were on the wrong end of a 23-19 scoreline against England in the previous round, in a far more open encounter, but relentless French defence in Cardiff kept Wales scoreless in the second half at the Principality Stadium. Overall, they were restricted to three penalties from the boot of Biggar as France ground out a 13-9 win. From a Welsh perspective much post-match analysis focused on a missed chance in the final quarter of an attritional contest. The peerless Wales No 8 Taulupe Faletau collected a perfectly weighted kick to the wing by Biggar and delivered an instant pass inside to the centre Jonathan Davies. Agonisingly for Wales, he could not gather the ball with the try-line beckoning. There was no guarantee, however, that Davies would have scored a try with Antoine Dupont, the powerful France scrum-half, in position to make a tackle. “It was a very tight Test match, wasn’t it?” Pivac said. “It came down to one score in the end. They had one opportunity and got it, and we couldn’t quite finish off ... Apart from winning the game, we did pretty much what we wanted to do out there to get the result.” Repeatedly asked if he felt frustrated, Biggar said: “It’s hard to answer the questions in a different way, really. It’s very, very difficult when there’s games you should have won and you’ve come off second best. It’s really pleasing, the way we’ve played. We put a really good shift in and pushed the best team in the world, probably at the moment, and we’ve pushed them to the edge, and probably should have picked a win up. But ultimately they’ve got the win, and we’re the one who are disappointed.” Welsh hopes of defending their Six Nations title had evaporated before Friday night but next weekend’s final-round meeting with Italy at the Principality Stadium will carry some significance: Biggar is poised to win his 100th Wales cap while Alun Wyn Jones, who will join the playing squad this week after successful rehabilitation from shoulder surgery, could claim his 150th. Biggar said: “It’s really important we come back in next week and don’t just use it as a ‘cruise week’, or a week to just get through to the end of the tournament ... I think we’ve got to go and do a job on Italy, not in any disrespectful way at all ... we’ve got to concentrate on ourselves and put on a really good performance out here on Saturday. Apart from the game against Ireland we’ve been right in the mix in games and played some really good stuff ... so for us to finish off with a positive result will be huge.” After a third straight win against Wales – following a sequence of seven defeats in eight before that – France head back to Stade de France in Paris next weekend and a chance to seal a grand slam against England. Les Bleus were depleted by Covid-19 in Cardiff, with Damien Penaud and Romain Taofifenua left at home after testing positive. But the picture painted by the head coach, Fabien Galthié, was of a more serious hit to their playing resources before the match. “We had a team that was ill, half of them with flu and half of them with Covid,” Galthié said of a squad that are gathering momentum before hosting next year’s World Cup. “But despite the virus the team has managed to get a victory, and that’s the most important thing.” The coach added: “Wales were very tactical and tried to push us back with a lot of very long kicks. We managed to react well to their game. We knew it would be difficult because they have won the competition several times, and it’s not by chance.” Told that Pivac had named them probably the world’s best team, the France captain Dupont said: “It’s very flattering to be praised by other teams. But to know who’s the best? We’ll see that later.” Starting against England in Paris next Saturday night.",Sport/Sport,Wales look for positives after coming up short against ‘best in the world’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/wales-look-for-positives-after-coming-up-short-against-best-in-the-world
3/13/2022,"A man who died after falling about 300 metres (1,000ft) down the UK’s highest mountain has been named as Samuel Crawford. The 28-year-old climber from Newtownards, County Down, Northern Ireland, slipped on the west side of Ben Nevis on 8 March , suffering fatal injuries, as 23 others were rescued in “ferocious” conditions. Crawford was married 18 months ago, and his wife Sophie is pregnant with their first child, the family’s minister said. In a tribute on east Belfast’s Sandown Free Presbyterian Church Facebook page, Reverend Garth Wilson said: “He was one of the brightest lights in our congregation in Sandown and we will miss him terribly. “Samuel was a fantastic husband to Sophie, and he would have been the best father to their little unborn child. He was also a great son and brother and was loved by so many. “The outpouring of grief since Samuel’s tragic death, shows just how much he was loved and so highly thought of by everyone.” Crawford was with his two best friends, Conor Bannister and Stephen McVeigh, when he fell, Wilson said. The father-to-be, survived also by his parents and sisters, spoke just over a year ago at Sandown Free Presbyterian Church about how his faith helped him through a serious illness, the BBC reports. Jim Shannon, the Democratic Unionist party MP for Strangford, who said he had known the family for years, also paid tribute to Crawford, describing him as “very committed to his family”. Mountain and police rescue teams were sent to Ben Nevisafter the alarm was raised at about 2.15pm on Tuesday. Twenty-three people were either airlifted by coastguard search and rescue helicopters from Prestwick and Inverness or walked off the 1,345-metre mountain by about 40 rescuers during an eight-hour operation. Brian Bathurst, the deputy team leader of Glencoe mountain rescue team, said the conditions were “ferocious” due to the extent of ice, wind and rain. Members of an army climbing group tried to rescue Crawford, with two receiving minor injuries requiring hospital treatment.

3/13/2022,"One of Russia’s most popular television news presenters, who has been accused of being a propagandist for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has British citizenship and a family flat in west London. Sergei Brilev has been reporting on the war in Ukraine on the state-controlled Rossiya 1, which tightly follows the Kremlin’s messaging. The channel describes the war as a “special military operation” launched to protect Ukrainian citizens from “abuse and genocide”. British government ministers are coming under pressure to impose sanctions on Brilev. The Labour MP Stephen Kinnock asked in parliament for the Home Office to “take steps to strip [him] of his British citizenship, ban him from the UK and freeze his UK assets”. The Home Office said last week it would not comment on individual cases. Kinnock said: “It seems to me there is clear evidence that Sergei Brilev is a propagandist for the Kremlin and plays an important role in supporting Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine. “The British government must conduct a full and thorough investigation into Mr Brilev in order to judge whether he should be sanctioned. Given the information I have seen, it seems the case is clear that he should be targeted for sanctions.” Other Russian television anchors have already faced sanctions by the EU over the state-backed disinformation about the Ukraine invasion. Olga Skabeyeva, 37, a talkshow host on Rossiya 1, was put under sanction by the EU last month, accused of spreading “anti-Ukrainian propaganda”. Another presenter on the channel, Vladimir Solovyov, 58, has also been the target of EU sanctions. It has been reported that two villas owned by him at Lake Como in Italy, worth €8m (£6.7m), have been sequestered by the authorities. Brilev is one of Russia’s best-known broadcasters. He was the official co-commentator for Putin’s presidential inauguration in 2018, when he was accused of failing to report on protests and detentions relating to the ceremony. He is also a member of the Russian international affairs council, co-founded by the Russian ministry of foreign affairs and presided over by the minister of foreign affairs, Sergei Lavrov. Brilev worked in London as a correspondent from 1996 to 2001. His interviewees have included Putin, Barack Obama and David Cameron. An investigation by the now jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in November 2018 revealed he was on the electoral roll in Britain and his wife owned a flat in Chiswick, west London, bought for £700,000 in March 2016. The presenter confirmed the claims on Facebook, writing: “My first British residence permit and second citizenship is a fact my employers know very well … “As for property in London, it was purchased through funds whose sources are transparent and well known to the relevant financial and tax authorities.” Land Registry records examined by the Observer last week revealed that Brilev’s wife, Irina, still owns the property. She is also a shareholder in the management company for the block in Chiswick. Many western journalists have been forced to pull out of Russia because of a new law passed earlier this month carrying jail terms of up to 15 years for spreading “fake news”. Rossiya 1 has mainly broadcast the Kremlin’s view of the Ukraine conflict, reporting that the “special operation” has been going as planned.

3/13/2022,"This time last year, the French presidential election was set to be a nail-biting race. Opinion polls suggested that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen was closing in on Emmanuel Macron, threatening his bid for a second term. One even suggested she might win the first-round vote. When the hard-right, hawkish Eric Zemmour joined the fray – but before he declared he was running – the political talk was dominated for several weeks by his anti-immigration, anti-Islam programme. Today, however, all those months of political sound and fury have come to nothing. Less than a month before the election, Macron is now a formidable 12 points ahead of Le Pen, his nearest rival. This is the largest first-round lead since François Mitterrand faced Jacques Chirac in 1988, making Macron’s re-election almost a foregone conclusion. In France, they are calling it the effet Malouines or “Falklands effect”: just as the conflict in the South Atlantic waged by Margaret Thatcher in 1982 led to her dramatic recovery in the polls and subsequent re-election, Macron’s popularity has soared, polls suggest, thanks to his high-profile engagement as Europe’s go-between in Russia’s war on Ukraine. For Macron’s rivals, the fortnight since Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine has been a particular challenge: unable to criticise the president’s actions on Ukraine for fear of appearing unpatriotic or unsympathetic, and faced with wall-to-wall media coverage of the conflict, they have struggled to drag the electoral agenda back to domestic issues. Le Monde described this presidential race as a “phantom campaign”– over before it had even begun. “Already overshadowed by the [Covid] health crisis, it seems to have been completely crushed by the war in Ukraine and its repercussions in Europe,” the political reporter Solenn de Royer wrote. “While the news is all about what’s happening in the east and the exchanges between Emmanuel Macron and Volodymyr Zelenskiy or Vladimir Putin, the other candidates have been pushed into second place and are having great difficulty pushing their agendas.” French presidential elections are notoriously unpredictable – the last two have seen supposedly unbeatable candidates crash out. But for months polls have suggested the most likely outcome of the 10 April vote will see the far-right Rassemblement National candidate Le Pen face Macron in the second round, with Macron winning – a repeat of the 2017 election, though by a narrower margin. Macron’s attempts to broker peace, including a trip to Moscow, in the run-up to Putin sending in the tanks may have failed, and Le Pen campaign leaflets may picture her meeting the Russian president, but neither has seen their standing damaged. Challenges to Le Pen from Zemmour and Valérie Pécresse, of the mainstream opposition right Les Républicains, and hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon are falling away. A recent Elabe poll suggested that Macron’s popularity rose 8.5 points to 33.5% in a week. Latest polls have Macron at least 12 points ahead of Le Pen, with Mélenchon, Zemmour and Pécresse behind in that order. Ukraine is now the second-greatest concern for French people quizzed by pollster Ipsos; the first is their spending power, with the environment in third place. “To be fair, the probability was that Emmanuel Macron would be re-elected even before the war in Ukraine … Now it’s going to be even easier because he is a wartime president,” Thomas Guénolé, a French political analyst, told the Observer. “We can describe that as the Falklands syndrome, especially as there is no serious chance that France will be in direct confrontation with Russia, so there is no risk of France being humiliated or defeated.” It is now 10 days since Macron announced his candidacy in a letter to the French people, and he has not even unveiled his election manifesto. So far, the only concrete proposal has been to raise the retirement age from 62 to 65. Laurent Jacobelli, Le Pen’s campaign spokesperson, admitted the war in Ukraine had made campaigning a challenge. “Obviously, our role in an international crisis is not to undermine the role of the French president in negotiations and diplomacy,” he said. ‘But it’s not normal that the president is making this the only subject and overshadowing the rest.” However, he added that the war had highlighted domestic issues on which Le Pen had long campaigned. “Now it’s for us to show that the globalisation of everything – energy, business, food production – and the way conflicts damage French sovereignty with our dependence on Nato, are as important as ever. People’s spending power, for example, especially when they fill up their cars, is still at the heart of the campaign and at the heart of voter concerns.” Jacobelli said the clocks will “go back to zero” once the initial boost caused by the conflict dies down. “As he did in 2017, Emmanuel Macron will try to sell this election on his personality, but after Covid, the gilets jaunes and his attempts to dissolve France within the European Union, maybe his personality will not be enough.” Françoise Pams, a member of Socialist party candidate Anne Hidalgo’s campaign team, said the campaign had been “completely requisitioned” by the Ukraine situation. “It’s understandable that Emmanuel Macron is ‘benefiting’ from the war in the sense that it gives him, as the country’s military chief, a lot of weight,” she said. “But while he is not campaigning, the rest of his government are doing so on his behalf, which isn’t right. “All we can do in terms of this election is to keep trying to pull the discussion back to the problems French people are facing and their main concern, which is their spending power. Fuel and energy costs are rising already, and this will only get worse.” Last Thursday and Friday, Macron dominated the headlines again after he hosted an emergency summit on Ukraine at Versailles – where the treaty that ended the first world war and established the League of Nations was signed – attended by the heads of 27 EU member states. Guénolé believes the most sensible approach now would be to postpone the election to avoid a “short-circuiting of democracy”, and says a victory in such circumstances will not do Macron any favours. “We have seen this in previous elections when a candidate won almost by default. If Macron wins under these conditions, it will not be five years of democratic government, but five years of disastrous political tension,” Guénolé said. Le Monde’s de Royer agreed, adding: “If this context serves the outgoing president, it further weakens an exhausted democracy.” In the Rassemblement National camp, however, the mood remains optimistic. “Nothing is certain,” said Ludwig Knoepffler, a graduate of King’s College London who is Le Pen’s international media adviser. “Nothing is written in advance and we carry on.”",News/World news,Macron revels in ‘Falklands effect’ as wartime role boosts re-election chances,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/macron-revels-in-falklands-effect-as-wartime-role-boosts-re-election-chances
