3/18/2022,"Tokyo school officials announced they are dropping controversial dress code policies for high school students, including those regulating hairstyles and underwear color and patterns.

Around 200 schools run by the Tokyo metropolitan government will implement five changes to the rules at the start of the new academic year beginning on April 1, according to a Mainichi Shimbun report.

The new changes will scrap long-held rules that prevented high school students from changing their hair color or wearing a “two-block,” a hairstyle that is long on top and short at the back and sides.

Tokyo’s metropolitan government will also drop rules dictating underwear color, the “practice of punishing students with a form of house arrest” and “ambiguous language in the guidelines on what is considered ‘typical of high school students.’”

Yuto Kitamura, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Education, said these changes signal a “major step forward,"" according to Mainichi Shimbun. While Kaori Yamaguchi, another member of the board, praised the move, she said it took the government too long to address the issue.

“Japanese people have been taught to believe that it is a virtue to simply abide by the rules,” Yamaguchi said. “I hope this will be an opportunity for people to discuss what we should do to create a society where rules are observed in a way that’s acceptable to everyone.”

The recent changes came after Tokyo’s Board of Education surveyed 240 schools in the city, asking parents and students about their views of the policies. The result found that the majority of people in education and students believed the 216 regulations were outdated.

Some schools are expected to retain a few of the rules, reportedly at the request of parents and students, including showing proof that a student’s hair is naturally curly or a certain color.

Students in Fukuoka, on the island of Kyushu, also answered a survey about the similar dress code in their city, stating their complaints that the rules had caused them stress and limited their self-expression.

The issue was first brought to the public’s attention in 2017 after an Osaka student, then 18, filed a lawsuit against the government for forcing her to dye her naturally brown hair black, which irritated her scalp. She won the case in February 2021 and received 330,000 yen (approximately $3,190 at the time) in compensation.

3/18/2022,"By Michael Martina and Humeyra Pamuk WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A planned summit between China and the European Union should be canceled until Beijing shows whether it stands with Russia or the West over the conflict in Ukraine, a senior Lithuanian official said on Wednesday. The 27-nation EU, of which Lithuania is a member, has said it plans to hold the top-level, likely virtual, meeting with China on April 1 to diffuse growing tensions between the two sides, but Lithuanian vice foreign minister Mantas Adomenas told Reuters that it was ""not the time for normalization."" ""In our assessment it is very ill-timed. In view of recent developments, it should be called off, or at least postponed significantly until we see which side China is on,"" Adomenas said in an interview during a visit to Washington. ""It is the time to show China that we mean business – that they cannot expect to occupy this ambiguous role, on one hand supporting Russia, on one hand using trading opportunities with the West – European Union, and expect no consequences,"" he said. But Adomenas said Lithuania, a former Soviet republic concerned about Moscow's broader intentions, had ""a lot of persuasion to do"" to convince other EU members that the summit should not go ahead. The EU regards China as a strategic rival in some areas, but seeks to encourage Beijing to reform trade rules at the World Trade Organization, even as it has imposed sanctions on some members of the European Parliament and punishes Lithuania over its move to allow Taiwan to open a de facto embassy. U.S. officials have told China that it will face consequences, including secondary sanctions, if Beijing provides Russia with material military or economic support in the Ukraine war, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation."" China and Russia announced an upgraded ""no limits"" strategic partnership just weeks before the conflict began, and Beijing has refused to term Moscow's actions an invasion, although Chinese leader Xi Jinping has called for ""maximum restraint"". NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday called on China to condemn Russia's invasion. Adomenas, in Washington for meetings with U.S. officials, said China was not an ""honest broker,"" and couldn't be relied on to help mediate a solution to the crisis, as Beijing has signaled. ""Certainly, if China joins in any way facilitating Russia's military effort, assisting its military, there ought to be sanctions. We will be arguing for it,"" he said, adding that there was a lot more that the West could do to support Ukraine. NATO could provide protection for humanitarian convoys and set up ""safe zones,"" Adomenas said, without elaborating, and added that the West should send Ukraine more sophisticated weapons such as U.S. Patriot surface-to-air missile defense systems. More Russian oligarchs and their family members needed to be sanctioned, Adomenas said, adding that Europe should also consider an oil embargo on Russia. ""Europe can resupply itself with oil from other sources. This is the kind of lifeline that finances the war,"" he said.
