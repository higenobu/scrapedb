1/13/2022,"Major figures from the world of film, including Susan Sarandon, Mark Ruffalo, Peter Capaldi and Charles Dance have issued a statement in support of Emma Watson and Palestinian solidarity. Last week, Watson, best known for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter franchise, was accused of antisemitism after she posted an image on Instagram showing a photograph of a pro-Palestinian protest with the banner “solidarity is a verb” written across it. It was accompanied with a quote about the meaning of solidarity from the intersectional feminist scholar Sara Ahmed.  The post drew strong criticism from Israeli officials, including Danny Danon, a former science minister in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, who said: “Ten points from Gryffindor for being an antisemite.” Israel’s current ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, said: “Fiction may work in Harry Potter but it does not work in reality. If it did, the magic used in the wizarding world could eliminate the evils of Hamas (which oppresses women and seeks the annihilation of Israel) and the PA (which supports terror).” In a letter organised by Artists for Palestine UK, a cultural network “standing together for Palestinian rights”, more than 40 named people, including Gael García Bernal, Jim Jarmusch, Maxine Peake, Viggo Mortensen and Steve Coogan, said: “We join Emma Watson in support of the simple statement that ‘solidarity is a verb’, including meaningful solidarity with Palestinians struggling for their human rights under international law.” Citing a report by Human Rights Watch claiming Israel is committing the crimes of apartheid and persecution, the artists, including Watson’s Harry Potter co-stars Miriam Margolyes and Julie Christie, continued: “We recognise the underlying power imbalance between Israel, the occupying power, and the Palestinians, the people under a system of military occupation and apartheid. “We stand against ongoing Israeli attempts to forcibly displace Palestinian families from their homes in the East Jerusalem neighbourhoods of Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan and elsewhere in the occupied Palestinian territory.” The artists added that they condemned all forms of racism, including antisemitism and Islamophobia. “Opposition to a political system or policy is distinct from bigotry, hatred and discrimination targeting any group of humans based on their identity,” they said. Other signatories include the screenwriter and producer James Schamus and the directors Asif Kapadia, Mira Nair and Ken Loach. Loach was recently expelled from the Labour party over the issue.",Arts/Film,Hollywood stars back Emma Watson after Palestinian solidarity post,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/hollywood-stars-back-emma-watson-after-palestinian-solidarity-post
1/13/2022,"The low-tax, free-market country that Lord Frost and other Tories aspire to (PM must commit to low taxes or risk losing next election, says David Frost, 9 Janurary) would be one where raw sewage continues to pollute rivers and coastline; where the NHS is starved of sufficient funding to ensure a high-quality health service for every citizen; where rough sleepers abound in our cities; where public transport is expensive and patchy in its coverage, forcing many extra car trips into our car-blighted towns, cities and countryside; where plastic pollution continues unabated; where state-funded schools are grossly underfunded; where councils are unable to carry out essential quality assurance for building works; where private building companies build houses for maximum profit rather than those needed by ordinary people; and where the environment is just a word having little significance compared with the need to ensure maximum profits for private companies. In reality, we need higher levels of taxation for individuals and businesses (especially foreign-owned online businesses) that can afford them. We also need European-dominated markets to minimise transport miles and their environmental impact.Chris OsmanOxford   So yet another leading Conservative demonstrates how out of touch they are with the electorate. I spent several days knocking on doors in the North Shropshire byelection. On “true blue” doorstep after doorstep, the concern expressed was not about too much public spending, but about too little: long before partygate hit the headlines, the insistent complaint was about the removal of most ambulance stations and the severe scarcity of GP services. The last time a sitting government suffered a swing to the Liberal Democrats comparable to that at North Shropshire was in 1993 (at Christchurch). Lord Frost and others like him might usefully reflect on what happened nationally at the next general election. His lordship’s obsession with low-tax policies may be shared by his new friends in the various self-important Tory ginger groups, but the mass of ordinary Conservative voters are far more interested in a properly funded and fully functioning NHS.Peter GeallCoventry",News/Politics,A sobering glimpse into life in low-tax Britain | Letters,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/a-sobering-glimpse-into-life-in-low-tax-britain
1/13/2022,"On 4 August 2020, a catastrophic explosion ripped through Beirut’s main port and into the city. In total, 218 people were killed. At the time, around 6pm, the artist and film-maker Joana Hadjithomas was in a cafe with a friend, around the corner from the studio she shares with her husband. The first thing she heard was a strange sound. “My friend and I just looked at each other. Instinctively, we went underneath the table. I curled up and protected my face.” As a teenager, she had lived through Lebanon’s civil war; taking cover was second nature, a survival reflex. Then came the massive blast. Afterwards, walking back to her apartment, she had no idea what was happening. An attack? An explosion? It was beyond comprehension. People were covered in blood; there was dust and rubble everywhere. “Wherever you looked, everything was destroyed. The scale was terrifying,” she says. In a state of shock, Hadjithomas had left her phone behind. When her husband, Khalil Joreige – frantic with worry – telephoned a couple of minutes later and a police officer answered, he feared the worst. Joreige tells the story with a shrug of helplessness, his face crumpling at the memory.  The couple met as teenagers and have been working together ever since. Living between Beirut and Paris, they make feature films, documentaries, video projects and photographic installations (their art is in the permanent collections of the V&A in London and the Guggenheim in New York City). He seems serious, intellectual. She is warm, with a gift for intimacy; happy to chat about art, kids, anything. They have two children, Alya, 21, and Ramzi, 11. When we meet, it is a little more than a year since the blast. The buzzy creative neighbourhood where they live and work, Gemmayzeh, was directly in the path of destruction. They lost friends and colleagues. Hadjithomas had minor injuries; her back was studded with little shards of glass. It is Joreige who tells me this: “It took months for the glass to leave her body.” Later, he explains that people of their generation snapped into survival mode during the explosion – moving away from windows, ducking under tables – just as they had learned as kids during the civil war. “Younger people went to the windows to film it; the young were hurt.” It is a horrible detail. But there were miracles, too. That afternoon, Joreige had wanted to stay late to work at the studio, which overlooks the port. But their kids pestered him into playing tennis in the mountains – “for the first time in 30 years”, he says with an expression somewhere between a grin and a grimace. Alya had recently flown back from England, where she is a student at University College London. She was meant to be quarantining; it was her last day, but she had snuck out of the apartment to play tennis. “They were lucky,” says Joreige. They left 30 minutes before the explosion. If he had stayed in the studio, if Alya had stayed at home … it doesn’t bear thinking about. “It’s not possible that nothing would have happened.” Hadjithomas and Joreige are in London for a screening of Memory Box, their first feature film in nine years, shot before the blast. It is a gem, full of thoughtfulness and quiet intensity, following three generations of women in Canada. Maia (played beautifully by Rim Turki), a psychoanalyst, left Lebanon at the end of the 80s and never went back. She lives in Montreal with her mother (Clémence Sabbagh) and her teenage daughter Alex (Paloma Vauthier). The film opens on Christmas Eve, when a large box arrives from Paris, full of notebooks that Maia wrote, during the civil war, to a friend, who has recently died. Her daughter reads the notebooks in secret; her mother is terrified that they will unearth a dark family secret. There are also flashbacks to Lebanon in the 80s, where Maia (played as a teenager by Manal Issa) is rebelling against her parents, living each day with intensity, as if it were her last – which, of course, it might be. The film tells a personal story. In 1982, during the civil war, when Hadjithomas was 13, her best friend moved to Paris. “We were devastated. We promised to write to each other every day.” She smiles gently. “It was a very teenage promise.” But they kept it up. For six years, she wrote daily, filling notebooks, sometimes 40 pages in one sitting, and recording voice memos on cassette tapes. “It was like a diary. I told her everything. I think it kept me alive in a way, emotionally.” After the war, she lost contact with her friend. Then, in 2013, the two women met for coffee in Paris and exchanged notebooks. Hadjithomas had the unnerving experience of meeting herself as a teenager. “This?!” she exclaims, burying her face in her hands. “This is who I was?” She didn’t recognise the girl on the page. Memory Box explores this gap between memory and history. The film has a beautiful, handcrafted feel, full of photos and art from the couple’s archive. Much of it is now gone. “Our artistic work is completely gone, blown away,” says Hadjithomas. Her husband nods: “Completely destroyed.” For weeks after the blast, they would come across their photos that had fluttered across the neighbourhood in the street, one time in a car park. Alya was 13 when the notebooks arrived, exactly the same age as her mum when she started writing. She begged to be allowed to read them. But the couple were adamant: no. It didn’t feel healthy. Especially not the bits about when they met, at 19. “No! No!” says Hadjithomas with mock-horror. But these conversations gave them a good idea for a plot: a daughter learning about her mother, who has always been a distant figure to her. “Here, but not present,” is how Hadjithomas describes Maia. She has met many people like that, living with trauma. As parents, Hadjithomas and Joreige have agonised about how to explain their experiences growing up in wartime to their kids. But they were never traumatised, Hadjithomas insists. Art and films saved them: “We lived violent things, but art led us out of it. We didn’t let the ghosts fill our life.”  Memory Box is released in UK and Irish cinemas and through virtual cinema platforms from 21 January",Arts/Film,’It took months for the glass to leave her body’: making Memory Box and surviving the Beirut blast,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/it-took-months-for-the-glass-to-leave-her-body-making-memory-box-and-surviving-the-beirut-blast
1/13/2022,"Mitch McConnell has been attacked by a key Trump ally and told to repair his relationship with the former US president or face failure as Senate Republican leader.  The move by Lindsey Graham comes amid a rumbling dispute between McConnell and Donald Trump, whose grip on the party remains near-total despite his impeachment for inciting the deadly Capitol attack in service of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was caused by electoral fraud. In the most recent round of the contest, McConnell sided with Mike Rounds, a South Dakota senator who said Biden won the election. “If you want to be a Republican leader in the House or the Senate, you have to have a working relationship with Donald Trump,” Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, told Fox News on Wednesday night. Acquitted in his second impeachment trial, Trump remains free to run for office. “He’s the most consequential Republican since Ronald Reagan,” Graham said. “It is his nomination if he wants it, and I think he’ll get re-elected in 2024. “I like Senator McConnell, he worked well with President Trump to get a bunch of judges including three supreme court justices on the bench, they got the tax cuts passed working together. “But here’s the question: can Senator McConnell effectively work with the leader the Republican party, Donald Trump? “I’m not gonna vote for anybody that can’t have a working relationship with President Trump, to be a team to come up with an America First agenda, to show the difference between us and liberal Democrats, to prosecute the case for Trump policies … because if you can’t do that, you will fail. I will tell you that.” Graham’s comment duly prompted criticism, one columnist calling it “a spineless cop-out”. It is after all a year since Graham apparently broke with Trump – a man he once said would “destroy” the Republican party. After the Capitol attack, like many senior Republicans Graham seemed ready to abandon his idol. “I’m out,” he said. But he was soon back in, telling Axios: “Donald Trump was my friend before the riot. I’m trying to keep a relationship with him after the riot. I still consider him a friend. What happened was a dark day in American history. And we’re going to move forward.” He also called Trump “sort of a cross between Jesse Helms, Ronald Reagan and PT Barnum. I mean, just bigger than life.” Helms, a North Carolina senator, was a segregationist and “unabashed racist”. PT Barnum was a politician, controversialist and circus impresario. McConnell and Trump have been at odds for some time. Their latest spat began after Rounds said Trump lost in 2020. Asking if Rounds was “crazy or just stupid”, Trump said: “I will never endorse this jerk again.” McConnell joined Mitt Romney of Utah and others in defending Rounds, McConnell telling CNN: “I think Senator Rounds told the truth about what happened in the 2020 election. And I agree with him.” John Thune of South Dakota – a contender to replace McConnell should it come to a vote – welcomed Rounds to “the club” of Republicans abused by Trump.",News/US news,"Make up with Trump or be a failure, Republican colleague warns McConnell",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/mitch-mcconnell-lindsey-graham-trump-republicans
1/13/2022,"Team GB chiefs have set their sights on their greatest ever Winter Olympics medal haul in Beijing next month – and reiterated their support for British athletes who want to protest against human rights abuses in China. With just over three weeks to go before the Games begin, the British Olympic Association and UK Sport are targeting between three to seven medals, a tally that could see the team break the record of five set in Sochi in 2014 and equalled in Pyeongchang in 2018.  While conceding the Olympics in China will be “extraordinarily challenging”, due to a range of factors, including Covid and human rights issues, UK Sport’s chief executive, Sally Munday, said that Team GB was determined to become “an even greater force in winter sports”. “Our intelligence tells us that British athletes have the potential to win between three and seven medals at the Olympics, and between five and nine medals at the Paralympics,” she added. “We have a young, dynamic, motivated team with real potential to excite and inspire the public.” Around 50 athletes are expected to be selected for the Winter Olympics, with the BOA also confirming that all will be vaccinated. Those challenging for medals will include snowboarder Charlotte Bankes, the three curling teams, and the men’s two and four-man bobsleigh. Andy Anson, the chief executive of the BOA, confirmed that officials would support British athletes who wanted to use the Games to take a stand over human rights abuses or to raise awareness of the Peng Shuai case, although he urged them to alert officials beforehand. He said: “We’ve told the athletes all along that we’re very happy for them to express themselves but to be sensible and to ideally touch base with those if they feel that they’re doing anything at all controversial . “We are not the ones who are going to stop our athletes expressing opinions. But equally, we are the ones who are going to give them sensible guidance about local laws and what’s expected locally so that they don’t come up against difficult situations. So it’s a fine balance.” Anson also indicated that he expected fans to attend the Winter Olympics – something that Chinese organisers are yet to confirm even though the Games open on 4 February. “I’m really pleased for the athletes that there will be spectators in China,” he said. “I think that will add a dimension over and above what we had in Tokyo that will make the Games exciting. I’m lucky enough, with Manchester United and as CEO of the ATP Tennis tour, to have been at live events out in China and to see the enthusiasm of the Chinese fans so that is a positive for the Games.”",Sport/Sport,Team GB targets record-breaking Winter Olympics medal tally in Beijing,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/13/team-gb-targets-record-breaking-winter-olympics-medal-tally-in-beijing
1/13/2022,"Pubs, bars and restaurants missed out on £3bn in sales over the festive period as the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant kept the public at home, resulting in a second “lost Christmas” for financially embattled proprietors. Sales slumped 60% on Christmas Day, 31% on Boxing Day and 27% on New Year’s Eve, compared with 2019, pushing pubs, clubs and restaurants from healthy trading at the start of December to “painful losses” by year end.  “December is a vital period for hospitality businesses, equal to three months’ worth of trading for many,” said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, which compiled the figures with consultancy CGA. “These new figures are crippling for an industry already struggling but also spell disaster for the wider UK economic recovery.” UKHospitality said in the run-up to December sales had returned to 98% of pre-pandemic levels, but the spread of Omicron and government guidance to work from home was once again stretching the financial viability of pubs, bars and restaurants. “Cash reserves are severely depleted, and some businesses will struggle to survive the first quarter,” said Nicholls. “These drops in sales versus 2019, and also against our members’ projections before the onset of the new Omicron variant, will have taken most businesses from healthy trading for the month to painful losses, delaying the sector’s recovery and extending hospitality’s long Covid.” The plight of proprietors was highlighted in a trading update from the pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers, the owner of chains including O’Neills, Harvester, All Bar One, Toby Carvery and Miller & Carter, which reported a 10.2% sales slump in the four weeks to 8 January compared with 2019. The company had reported sales running at 2.7% ahead of 2019 levels in the eight weeks to 20 November, before Omicron emerged. M&B also said that costs were set to rise from the pre-Covid £60m to £65m annually, “due particularly to high levels of statutory wage rate increases and persistent historic high prices in energy markets”. “The group is in a reasonable position for when things start to get back to normal,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Although the amount of times that has been said in the last couple of years is best left uncounted.” Nicholls said hospitality businesses were facing severe headwinds this year, as well as inflationary pressures as the “cliff edge” approaches when the government raises VAT on the sector from 12.5% back to 20% as well as a rise in business rates. On Friday, the Office for National Statistics said that 40% of all hospitality businesses say they have less than three months of cash reserves, including 11% with none at all. Also, 17% of these hospitality firms have low or no confidence of surviving the next three months, the gloomiest outlook across the economy.",News/Business,Second ‘lost Christmas’ for UK hospitality as Omicron hits sales,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/second-lost-christmas-for-uk-hospitality-as-omicron-hit-sales
1/13/2022,"Russia has said talks with Nato over Ukraine were hitting a dead end, while threatening to take unspecified “necessary measures” if its demands were not met. A volley of downbeat statements from Russian senior officials emerged as Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, warned that Europe faced its greatest risk of war in 30 years.  Rau was addressing the 57 nations of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the third time this week Russia has discussed security with western countries. The Polish minister, who has taken over the OSCE chair, told reporters, “I cannot say a breakthrough is imminent” in discussions on European security, while pledging to launch a dialogue. “Some of the participating states believe that it’s enough to make a statement and not to participate in debate,” he said, without naming countries. “It seems that the risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years,” Rau had told delegates earlier. “For several weeks we have been faced with the prospect of a major military escalation in eastern Europe.” Russia has mobilised 100,000 troops and placed military hardware along its border with Ukraine, while issuing a series of security demands that Nato has said are impossible to meet, such as removing troops from eastern members of the alliance and a block on any membership application from Kyiv. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation in talks with the US on Monday, said the discussions were hitting a dead end. “I do not see any reason to sit down again in the coming days, to gather again and start these same discussions,” he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. “We propose to go step by step through the text, to work on it in order to bring it to a stage where it would be ready to sign. This is impossible today, because on the key elements of these texts, the United States and its allies say categorically ‘no’.” Speaking on Russian television, he did not exclude the possibility that Russia could deploy military hardware to Cuba or Venezuela, saying it “all depends on the actions by our US counterparts”. Separately, Russia’s mission to the OSCE threatened the country would take “necessary measures” if the west did not respond to Russian demands. “If we don’t hear constructive response to our proposals within reasonable timeframe & aggressive behaviour towards [Russia] continues, we’ll have to take necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our national security,” Russia’s mission to the OSCE wrote on Twitter, citing its ambassador to the OSCE, Alexander Lukashevich. The Russian OSCE mission also warned that “a crisis on the continent may arise with unpredictable consequences for European security”. In Moscow, the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said there could be a complete rupture in US-Russian relations, if proposed sanctions targeting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and other top civilian and military leaders were adopted. Senate Democrats have also proposed targeting leading Russian financial institutions if Moscow sends troops into Ukraine. The EU is also drawing up possible sanctions, although has declined to reveal details. Senior Russian officials met US counterparts on Monday and Nato on Wednesday, but talks have failed to yield results. Nato’s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Wednesday the military alliance was ready to hold talks with Moscow on arms control and transparency over military exercises. Russia’s foreign minister appeared to reject this offer. Ryabkov said there were nuances in the discussions, but on the main issue for Russia – non-expansion of Nato – the talks were “impenetrable, at least, for now”. He added: “This is worrying because we haven’t hidden that everything else depends on progress in this matter.”",News/World news,Russia says talks with Nato over Ukraine are hitting a dead end,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/russia-says-talks-with-nato-over-ukraine-are-hitting-a-dead-end
1/13/2022,"Italian police have detained two men accused of involvement in a series of sexual assaults during New Year’s Eve celebrations in Milan. Abdallah Bouguedra, 21, and Abdelrahman Ahmed Mahmoud Ibrahim, 18, are accused of “serious sexual assault accompanied by the robbery of mobile phones and handbags”, Milan’s acting prosecutor, Riccardo Targetti said.  The pair have been held in custody as there is a “concrete danger” of them trying to escape, given the serious allegations against them, Targetti added. They are alleged to have been among a gang who sexually assaulted at least nine women during during celebrations in front of Milan’s cathedral on Piazza del Duomo. Ibrahim’s lawyer said his client had told police he was at the square but denied any involvement. Police raided the homes of 18 suspects, including three under the age of 18, on Tuesday. Twelve people are currently being investigated. Police said the suspects are foreign or Italian of north African origin. The case prompted comparisons with the mass sexual attacks and muggings that took place in the German city of Cologne on New Year’s Eve in 2015-16. Several women, including two Germans who had been visiting Milan, came forward with their reports in the days after New Year’s Eve, with the number rising to nine by Tuesday. Police believe more women were assaulted. The women shared similar stories of being dragged into the crowd, shoved and groped during the fireworks display. A 19-year-old woman alleged that she was set upon by a gang of youths at about 1.30am and attacked for about a minute before help arrived. Her friend managed to get away. A Milan investigator told Corriere della Sera that the women were “passed around like rag dolls” and in one incident “one [suspect] held the victim while the other abused her”. The two German women said they were pushed up against barriers and sexually assaulted. They filed their reports after returning to Germany. One young woman suffered scrapes when her jumper was torn and trousers pulled down. She was taken to hospital by police for examination. Another was attacked on a street close to the square. Police identified the suspects based on CCTV images, the accounts of the victims and witnesses, as well as via the analysis of social media posts. Milan’s mayor, Giuseppe “Beppe” Sala, has apologised to the women, “also on behalf of the city”.",News/World news,Two men detained in Italy over Milan new year sexual assaults,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/two-men-detained-in-italy-over-milan-new-year-sexual-assaults

A Boston United season ticket holder, he often turned to sport – and football in particular – in his choice of analogies. Here are some of his most famous Van-Tam-isms. On the development of the Pfizer vaccine, Downing Street coronavirus briefing, November 2020 So this is like getting to the end of the play-off final.

On plans for the vaccine rollout, Downing Street press briefing, November 2020 I do believe that we are now on the glide path to landing this plane. Yes I do. Do I accept that sometimes when you are on the glide path, you can have a side wind and the landing is not totally straightforward, totally textbook? Of course I do. On MHRA approval of the Pfizer vaccine, Downing Street press briefing, December 2020 The train has now slowed down safely. It has now stopped in the station. And the doors have opened – that was the authorisation by the MHRA. What we need now is for people to get on that train and travel safely to their destinations. On the vaccine rollout, BBC News channel, December 2020 It’s clear in the first half, the away team gave us an absolute battering, and what we’ve done now is it’s the 70th minute, they got a goal, and in the 70th minute we’ve now got an equaliser. OK, we’ve got to hold our nerve now, see if we can get another goal and nick it. On storing the Pfizer vaccine, Downing Street press briefing, December 2020 This is a complex product. It’s not yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times. On the need for booster jabs, Downing Street press briefing, November 2021 Omicron is like now picking up a couple of yellow cards to key players on top. We are maybe OK, but we’re kind of starting to feel at risk that we might go down to 10 players, and if that happens – or it’s a risk that’s going to happen – then we need everyone on the pitch to up their game in the meantime.
