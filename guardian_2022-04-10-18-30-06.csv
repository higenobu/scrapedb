4/10/2022,"Dr Naomi Spiers was sleeping off a night shift when there was a loud bang on the door. She curled up under the covers but the knocking wouldn’t stop. When she answered, her visitor – wearing a face mask and bulletproof vest – demanded £425. He held out a card machine for her to pay. “I was like, ‘What the hell?’ He said, ‘Is that your car? I’ve put a clamp on it.’” Spiers’s original offence was late payment of a £2.50 toll charge. Working night shifts in A&E, she says she had missed the payment deadline of midnight the following day, and the debt had been passed to a private enforcement firm. She asked if she could arrange a payment plan, but claims the bailiff insisted she pay on the spot. “He said, ‘You’ve only a few minutes until the tow truck comes, and then it’s going to be another £800,’” said Spiers. The company disputes her account. She needed her car to get to work that night, so she paid the £425. “I felt so put upon, and the only way I could make him go away was to pay. It felt like bullyboy tactics,” she said. “When he left, I was unbelievably angry and shaken. It was like, ‘Pay pay pay pay pay, otherwise it’s going to treble’.” The 36-year-old, from south-east London, is one of a growing number of Britons being visited by bailiffs, widely used by public sector bodies to recoup cash – sometimes for the most minor of violations. There are limits to the fees bailiffs can charge, but in extreme cases, the amount can be hundreds of pounds more than the original sum owed. In Spiers’s case, the bailiff claimed she had been sent several letters, including the original penalty charge notice and subsequent enforcement reminders. But Spiers says she received only one letter and that it was backdated. She tried to pay the £180 fine, but when she phoned the premium-rate helpline in her lunch break, she couldn’t get through. By the time she was confronted by a bailiff at her door, the fee was 170 times the original toll charge. “It’s daylight robbery,” she said. Before the pandemic, referrals to bailiffs had been rising rapidly, with about 3m civil enforcement cases in 2019, according to the Centre for Social Justice – an increase of more than 600,000 in five years. In the first lockdown, the government suspended bailiff visits but they resumed later that year, with members of the Civil Enforcement Association conducting more than 1.5m visits between September 2020 and April 2021. Charities have warned that the number of cases involving bailiffs is set to surge as rising costs of living push households into debt. New figures suggest they are already beginning to climb, with Citizens Advice receiving 2,704 requests for help with bailiffs last month compared with 1,884 in December. Most cases Citizens Advice hears about involve council tax arrears, but bailiffs – who are also widely used by energy and utility companies – are increasingly being engaged over minor violations such as parking fines, according to the Money Advice Trust. For those on the receiving end, it can be traumatising and humiliating. In one case recorded by the debt advice charity StepChange earlier this year, a recently widowed woman was contacted by bailiffs “two to three times a day for payment of council tax arrears”. “Client suffers from serious mental health issues and it’s causing her more stress,” the helpline advisers wrote in their notes. In another case, a woman whose partner was having chemotherapy was visited in the dark by bailiffs “banging loudly on the door and shouting ‘you don’t pay your council tax’”. Faith Gillin, 53, from Northampton, said she was left “incredibly anxious” after a visit from bailiffs in October. For the mother of one, the knock had come on a dark morning at 6am. “I came down in my dressing gown and there was this big chap standing there. He said, ‘Do you remember driving in a bus lane in April?’” She later realised she had forgotten to update her address with the DVLA as required, and a fine sent to her old address had gone unpaid. But the council had not contacted her at her new address, despite having the details on record, she says – instead passing the debt to an enforcement firm. While Gillin “didn’t have a problem” with the £440 fine, she feels that “to have somebody banging on your door at 6am because you’ve gone into a bus lane is ridiculous”. “I was shaken by it for a couple of weeks. It distressed me to the point that when my postman knocked on the door I didn’t want to answer it,” she said. She accused councils of failing in their duty of care by passing smaller debts to bailiffs, which she said could have a severe impact on people’s mental health. “It’s using a sledgehammer to crack a nut,” she said. The Civil Enforcement Association said the industry was “committed to raising standards” and that there was “no evidence of systemic problems with the use of enforcement agents”. It added that complaints were investigated thoroughly and that bailiffs helped recover hundreds of millions of pounds for the taxpayer. There have been improvements in recent years. In 2014, the government brought in guidance that says bailiffs must not act in a threatening or deliberately embarrassing manner, should not press debtors to make unreasonable offers of payment and should withdraw from cases where the person is deemed vulnerable. And later this year, a new independent body to oversee bailiffs is due to be launched after years of campaigning. The exact remit of the Enforcement Conduct Board is yet to be fixed, but it is expected to investigate complaints and fine firms for poor practice, and has been welcomed by the industry as a “landmark reform”. Councils and government agencies, meanwhile, say their use of bailiffs is proportionate. Highways England said it only used bailiffs when people had not responded to a penalty charge notice. It said it was not required to visit customers in person before referring cases, and that bailiffs underwent comprehensive checks and training. The Local Government Association said bailiffs should only ever be a “last resort”. But charities and campaigners want further reform – including statutory regulation to hold bailiffs to account – and say that a more compassionate approach is needed. Concerns have been raised about the employment model used by most bailiff firms – where agents are self-employed workers who earn commission based on their caseload, rather than employees with a salary. One advert for a major bailiff firm – which describes those with a military, police or HMP prison background as desirable candidates – offered “uncapped commission” with “realistic earnings between £35k and £65k”. Ed McDonagh, policy officer at StepChange, said the model drove “a lot of the bad practice”. “Often the aggressive practices of the bailiffs will force people just to pay them off: they’ll lean on high-cost credit, friends and family or loan sharks just to get these people off their backs, pushing them into this spiral of debt,” he added. Jane Tully, from the Money Advice Trust, said that while there had been a “modest improvement” in the sector, the charity was still hearing about “poor practice”, including bailiffs “refusing affordable offers of payments, misrepresenting their powers or using threatening language and not taking account of people’s circumstances, even in cases where they are particularly vulnerable”. “We need to see more action to stop people from falling behind in the first place, and to ensure those who do are treated fairly,” she said. Some councils are taking a different approach. Since 2017, Hammersmith and Fulham has adopted a process it terms “ethical debt collection”. Rather than passing debts to third-party enforcers, it handles them itself. The decision was sparked by concerns about the sector and the need to protect residents. Two years earlier, Jerome Rogers, a courier who transported blood between hospitals in Croydon, had taken his own life after facing demands for £1,019 from bailiffs who clamped his vehicle. The 20-year-old had been issued with two £65 traffic fines, but added charges saw the fee soar by more than £800. In extreme cases where there is persistent non-payment, the council can still take the person to court and obtain a liability order for the debt. But before it reaches that stage, it opts for early intervention, “working constructively with families who are struggling to pay”, contacting them via different means and “working closely with the advice sector”. In the first year after the scheme’s launch, the council collected 96.76% of all the council tax it was owed – an improvement on previous years. “We don’t want to be sending bailiffs to people’s doors,” said Councillor Maxwell Schmid, cabinet member for finance, who pioneered the scheme. “But in addition to the moral side of this, what you’re actually doing is risking driving families into more desperate situations and homelessness. Who then picks up the housing bill? “If people are pushed further into debt, the whole public sector will end up picking up the pieces.”",Lifestyle/Money,"‘Pay up, or it trebles’: bailiffs accused of strong-arm tactics in UK",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/10/uk-councils-turn-to-bailiffs-to-collect-tolls
4/10/2022,"Donald Trump’s inner circle has, in Mike Bartlett’s satire, turned into a Shakespearean court of a near future in which the former president is back in the game. The script, best in its granular moments of comedy, blends billionaire pomp with political chicanery, dynastic family drama and blank verse. Trump arrives on stage in a golf buggy, throwing out a prologue after which his children stride on looking like expensively dressed accountants with lacquered helmet hair. Bertie Carvel’s Trump calls himself the devil and proceeds to have all the best lines. He also bears all the tics and inflections of the real Donald, encapsulating Trump’s swaggering facility to amuse and to showboat, to coin an offensive catchphrase and use it to best effect. Tamara Tunie as Kamala Harris is just as magnetising in her performance, exuding strength and bounce but, like Carvel, steers away from a simple Dead Ringers-style impersonation. Like King Charles III, this play is partly spoken in iambic pentameter but despite the literary ingenuity in Bartlett’s script, it falls oddly flat. There is intelligent direction from Rupert Goold and a handsome set by Miriam Buether, which captures a courtly majesty. But the drama looks and feels like a conceptual riff rather than truly Shakespearean in its effects. Carvel’s Trump has shades of Richard III but is also a King Lear of the late capitalist age, not carving up his kingdom between his children but setting up a contest with only one winner of his inheritance – the free market at work even in the shadow of his death. At times it feels more like a sporting pastiche of Shakespeare’s tragedies than a barbed satire on Trumpian politics. A comically sleepwalking Joe Biden (Simon Williams) is reminiscent of Lady Macbeth, Ivanka Trump (Lydia Wilson) fulminates with a generic brand of filial betrayal and ambition in her soliloquies and the blinding of a secondary character for spying is a nod to the Earl of Gloucester in King Lear. It is too literal in its central plotline too: set in 2024, Biden is on course for a second presidential run until Trump’s comeback and an attempted military coup. The rebellion on stage looks like a flashback rather than a flashforward, taking on the iconography of the storming of the Capitol, right down to the infamous bull horned headdress, although the movements of the braying mob here are choreographed in rather laboured, slow-motion sequences. It is clear that this near future is a reenactment of the recent past with all the familiar accompanying narratives on the rise of American populism, from the arrogance of the liberal elite to the abandonment of the working people. There is even a subplot featuring siblings on either side of the political divide that plays out these arguments for good measure. In its ideas the play cannot plumb enough depths to bring up anything new – perhaps we are still too close to the Trumpian moment for any greater wisdom to be mined. In its drama it lacks atmosphere and jeopardy, its pace slow in the second half and its ending flat. There are some delightful lines in Bartlett’s script nonetheless and it is in these moments that the play sparkles: an incarcerated Trump in an orange jumpsuit gives his jailtime a PR spin by claiming it will endow him with a “cool Mandela feel” in the eyes of the people. His slanging matches and put downs of Biden, who he calls an “elderly wizard”. His eulogy of Machiavelli’s The Prince although he admits he hasn’t read it all because it was too long: “Someone summed it up, and it made sense.” And the moment when Harris tells Trump that his legacy is a farce: “You will be mocked if ever you will be remembered,” she says, and this play proves her point. At the Old Vic, London, until 28 May",Arts/Stage,The 47th review – Bertie Carvel is devilishly good but this Trumpian satire feels too soon,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/10/the-47th-review-old-vic-theatre-mike-bartlett-trumpian-satire
4/10/2022,"Like Satan in Milton’s Paradise Lost, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, apparently has restless thoughts and only finds ease in destroying. Doubtless, Dorries is aware on some level of the epic poem, in her capacity as guardian of the nation’s cultural treasures, and as an author herself, and yet she learns nothing from it. So how can it be true that the latest innocent public benefit to fall in her sights is a harmless wild bird that has delighted dog walkers and local schoolchildren for generations? For nearly 20 years now, a mysterious, enormous and colourful parrot, nearly 3ft in height, has dwelt on the sylvan slopes of Robinswood Hill, a country park south of Gloucester, in a strip of land between the A38 and the M5. I glimpsed it once, as a younger man, flashing blue and red between the green woodland canopy and the orange evening sky and briefly I felt I saw the face of God. In Gloucester. The bird is even rumoured to have inspired local ski-jumper Eddie “the Eagle” Edwards to pursue his dreams of unassisted human flight, but his trainer, Bronson Peary, forbade him from using his preferred nickname of Eddie “That Enormous Colourful Parrot From Robinswood Hill” Edwards, saying it was “dumb-ass”. No one knows where the enormous colourful parrot came from and its miraculous ongoing survival is said to be assisted by a discreet local support network of undercover amateur ornithologists, who derive enormous pleasure from spotting it in the wild and only want it to be free to view, asking nothing in return. Why then, has Dorries announced her intention to annihilate it? What has an enormous and colourful parrot ever done to her? Does she even need a motive, beyond a kind of jealous hatred of anything beautiful, which shames her spiritual ugliness by its mere existence? Dorries’s hostility to magic and beauty in all its forms, and to the abstract notion of joy itself, became apparent when she spoke, in November last year, to the Select Committee Panel on Mysterious Wild Birds. Using a collection of words, some of which formed complete sentences, Dorries explained: “I think it’s right that an enormous colourful parrot, in the rapidly changing environment that we’re in at the moment. I think the future and the longevity of that enormous colourful parrot should be brought into question and should be. Particularly when it is in receipt of taxpayers’ money. It is our responsibility to evaluate whether taxpayers are receiving value for money and whether taxpayers. And whether that model is sustainable in the future. I think it’s absolutely right and proper that we should do so. And that is the process we are going through. So I would argue that to say that just because the enormous colourful parrot has been established, as a public service, and just because it’s in receipt of public money, we should never kind of audit the future of the enormous colourful parrot, and we should never evaluate how the enormous colourful parrot looks in the future, and whether or not it is a sustainable and viable enormous colourful parrot. It’s right that the government should do that.” But do what? What was Dorries saying? The silence of a baffled and stunned Mysterious Wild Bird committee room, in the face of a statement both incoherent and nonsensical, was broken only by the plaintive factual knowledge of Damian Green. “But the enormous colourful parrot isn’t in receipt of public money. It is sustained by nuts, vegetables and fruits left out by local folk, and by foods it forages itself from the 62-mile radius of its territory stretching out, presumably, right over the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean, providing huge value, at no cost, to a wide community.” Dorries replied, literally: “OK. And so… ay … although it’s… and yes but… that”, having learned nothing from her former use of random words as a smokescreen to hide a deeper incoherence. Dorries has gone on to say that the enormous colourful parrot must be caught and sold to the highest bidder and that the profits will be “invested”, although the recent Conservative track record suggests the parrot will end up belonging to a party donor, or a friendly pub landlord, who will exploit it and bleed it dry, until it is no longer of any use to anyone and then dies. The enormous colourful parrot costs the taxpayer nothing. It is self-sufficient, and even profitable, drawing curious ornithologists to an economically depressed town, and providing daily meaning to the lives of those who seek it and sustain it, as well as inspiring generations of children to pursue lifelong careers in the study and support of wild birds. Why does Dorries want it destroyed? Local park ranger Dursley Tyndale gave me his opinion, when I walked the hill with my children last week. “I didn’t know who she was. She parked here once and I said, ‘Don’t park there love. That’s round where that parrot nests and he will shat on your bonnet.’ She just flicked her Vs at me and went into the woods with some bottles of prosecco and a toilet roll. When she came back she had loo paper stuck on her shoe and there was all parrot’s shat all on the car and she started effing and blinding and saying she would get that f***ing parrot. I think it’s pride. She was made to look foolish and now she’s taking it out on that poor parrot. It’s evil, like something old Fred would have done back in the day. I’ll still probably vote for the Tories though. Well, I mean, that Jeremiah Crosby, he’s incompetent isn’t he, doolally?” Rescheduled national 2022 dates of Stewart’s 2020 tour, Snowflake Tornado, are on sale now, as are Edinburgh fringe shows.

4/10/2022,"Awoman, mute and considered a holy, “sweet” fool by her fellow villagers, suffers such excruciating head pain that she’ll walk up to her neck into freezing water or dig herself a pit in the soil. She’s the title character – and pivotal agony – of the book that Andrey Kurkov (arguably Ukraine’s leading writer – and now war diarist) has described as “the best contemporary Ukrainian novel written since Ukrainian independence in 1991”. First published in 2003 and garlanded with awards throughout eastern Europe, this is its first English translation. Unlike Kurkov, with his satirical, semi-surreal and rather more urban settings, Matios takes us deep into the very rural Carpathians, to a Hutsul village split in two by the river that marks the border with Romania. It’s tempting to read it as magic realism but you could argue that it’s a wholly realistic portrait of the Hutsuls’ own acceptance of everyday magic and the ever-intrusive hand of God. The events aren’t magic – the magic is in the soil, on the hillsides on which they pasture their cows and goats, in the trees from which they pick their plums and cherries. Has Darusya been touched by the hand of God and is that why she has lost her wits? Or is another, more prosaic hand to blame and she is just another victim of human-made trauma? The answer lies in what Matios calls “A Drama for Three Lives”, unscrolling in reverse chronological order, beginning in the 60s with “The Everyday Drama”. Here, we see our protagonist digging up dahlias by the root and carrying them round the village, swaddled in a blanket like infants. Or else shimmying up the pear tree to decorate it with tinsel: “Why should the tree be sad, when the autumn sun warms up, when Darusya isn’t racked with pain in her brain?” The second life, “The Previous Drama”, takes us back to the early 50s. Ivan Tsvychok, a foul-mouthed, itinerant musician (his chosen instrument: the drymba or jew’s harp) has discovered Darusya’s secret: she is not entirely mute. When she visits her father’s grave, taking him a full picnic basket, she talks. Seeing that there is more to this woman than her “sweetness”, Ivan becomes her protector, her carer, and finally moves into her house. Are they lovers? Even the locals can’t be sure: the entire narrative is punctuated by garden-fence chats between two villagers, one scandalised by Darusya, the other coming to her defence. These dialogues, written with an archness that would shame an Ealing comedy, offer respite from the intensity and monomania of Darusya’s life. Like David with Saul, Ivan eases the agony inside her head with his drymba. Almost inevitably, the Soviet authorities, wary of this incomer, drive him from the village: “It’ll be peaceful, Ivan, in the next world. But while we are the authority – we must know everything.” The final “Main Drama” takes us back to the early 40s, when the village becomes a cat’s-paw tossed between Romanians, Soviets and Germans and then Soviets again. Darusya’s father, in charge of the communal farm’s warehouse, is faced with the dilemma of keeping his family safe when the partisans burst in and demand resupply. It’s a circle that cannot be squared and so we come to witness the events that triggered Darusya’s silence. This is a strange, and strangely intangible, tale, not especially helped by a translation that, in an attempt to capture the informality of the Hutsuls’ language, verges on patronising and occasionally slips into incomprehensibility. So it’s greatly to the story’s credit that its honesty, love and humanity shine unstoppably through. Matios offers a heartbreaking insight into what, historically, it has meant to be Ukrainian and what it is that they’re now fighting for.

4/10/2022,"There was a tremendous kerfuffle last week over the Bank of England’s “more inclusive” rebranding of its logo, at a reported cost of £50,000. This makeover involved removing a pile of coins at Britannia’s feet and replacing the St George’s Cross with the union flag. Responding to the scorn the rebranding received, a Bank spokeswallah said: “Since 2019, the Bank of England has been reviewing its visual communications to make it more accessible, inclusive and reflect our current values and mission. How we communicate is part of how we can carry out our mission.” If communication is the motivating force of the institution, it would be a good idea if such statements are made in plain English. Why should the Bank be on a “mission”, whatever that is? Surely its function is to keep a weather eye on the nation’s wealth. I’m pretty certain that my grandfather, who worked at the Bank, would have had a fairly salty reaction to such nonsense. To more down-to-earth issues. I couldn’t help but notice a legend emblazoned on the side of a dustcart – “Cardboard and co-mingled recycling”. I’m pretty certain that in the good old days we would have said mixed rather than co-mingled. Not to be outdone, MasterChef introduced a quite horrible word, courtesy, I think, of Gregg Wallace, who referred to the wannabes as “auditioners” rather than “contestants”. If he was indeed the culprit, I think a whack with a skillet is in order. No such punishment for the woman who, on Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, introduced the most wonderfully mangled expression: “We’re going to hell in a handbasket.” What a delightful image and more power to her elbow.  Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",News/From the Observer,May I have a word about… the Bank of England’s rebranding | Jonathan Bouquet,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/commentisfree/2022/apr/10/may-i-have-a-word-about-bank-of-england-rebranding
4/10/2022,"In a flat in east London, on the night of 31 March, two dozen people in their early 20s are packing sleeping bags and energy bars and discussing unorthodox toilet arrangements. There are bowls of vegan curry on the table and a Fontaines DC gig on the television. You might assume that they were going to a music festival, if not for the foldable ladders. In fact, they are all members of the new campaign group Just Stop Oil, which is demanding the cessation of all new oil licences in the UK. Their plan is to bring traffic in and out of the Navigator oil terminal in Thurrock, Essex, to a grinding halt a few hours from now. From the window of the flat they can see Navigator’s vast white silos. “I saw it earlier and my stomach flipped,” says Hannah Hunt, a 23-year-old from Brighton. She calls it “the venue”. Hunt is a veteran of Just Stop Oil’s precursors, Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain. In recent months she has delivered a letter containing Just Stop Oil’s demands to No 10 Downing Street, scaled the Fawley oil refinery in Southampton, and glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards. She experiences anxiety before an action but once it’s happening, she enters “a weird, dreamy, calm mindset. It’s really empowering.” Another prematurely seasoned activist is Louis McKechnie, who served half of a three-month term in jail for blocking the M25 and recently tied himself to a goalpost during a match between Everton and Newcastle. He’s a confident 21-year-old with curtained hair and large glasses. During his pitch invasion, Twitter users compared him to John Lennon and Paul Dano’s Riddler in The Batman. Most of the activists – members of the Youth Climate Swarm – have never been arrested before. “Today will be arrest number 16 for me,” McKechnie says after a legal briefing, “so if you have any questions, I’ll be here all night.” After dinner, she produces a map and holds an action meeting for a sub-group of 10. The plan rests on the “site-take team” blocking all transit in and out of the terminal by scaling the tankers and camping out there, which makes it illegal for the driver to move the vehicle. It’s a difficult, stressful thing they are about to do but the mood is surprisingly festive. When Hunt asks them to shout out their primary and secondary roles in the action, there are giggles. “Back and top!” “Bush and top!” When Insulate Britain blockaded motorways last autumn, each action was over in less than an hour but it takes a specialist police team to remove people from high places. The idea is to stay up there for days on end. Sleep is minimal. Preparations don’t wrap up until 1am and the activists have to rise again at 2.30am. As they wait for a minibus on a street corner in the bitter cold, Hunt convenes a trust circle. “I trust myself, I trust you, I trust the group,” they recite. On the bus, they switch to whimsical nature-based codenames such as Broccoli and Meadow. They talk about their nerves, and about making history. At around 4am, the minibus pulls up a little way from the terminal. The activists disembark and scurry through the roadside undergrowth towards the entrance. Suddenly, the flashing lights of a police car jangle the night. They’ve been expected. They think for a moment that it’s game over. But they press on. Three activists sit down in front of the first tanker and unfurl an orange banner reading JUST STOP OIL. Twenty-year-old Pavel Ivanov takes the role of de-escalator, talking to drivers and the police. Everyone else clambers on to one of three tankers. It all takes maybe two minutes. After a while, a police officer approaches the second tanker and tries to reason the occupiers down. “We’re trying to raise awareness of the climate emergency,” says one, lean and bearded. “Everybody’s aware,” the officer protests. The activist shrugs. “There’s a difference between awareness and action.” One Monday night in March, Roger Hallam is talking about the end of the world as we know it. The Leaf Hall community arts centre in Eastbourne was founded by the evangelical Christian and temperance campaigner William Leaf in 1863, so it is an apt venue for a man with the air of an apocalyptic prophet. Wiry and intense, with a greying beard and ponytail, the 55-year-old is well suited to the role of climate Jeremiah. “People are suddenly going, ‘This is it. This is the end,’” he says. “Because it is. There are ends. And it will happen unless we stop it. That’s the way it is in 2022.” Thirty purple plastic chairs have been laid out but only 13 are occupied. “That’s totally predictable,” Hallam says. “Most people don’t want to do things.” Hallam speaks for more than an hour without notes. He opens by quoting a speech by Sir David King, formerly the UK government’s chief scientific adviser and special envoy on climate change: “What we do over the next three to four years, I believe, is going to determine the future of humanity. We are in a very, very desperate situation.” That was one year ago. Hallam says that it is already too late to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5C. He predicts hundreds of millions of climate refugees by 2030, and worse. “Mass slaughter, mass rape, mass starvation,” he says. “That’s what’s coming down the line.” Hallam likes to say that he is “just a farmer from Wales”, or at least he used to be. He blames the collapse of his organic farming business on a series of extreme weather events several years ago. Later he researched the history of civil disobedience for a PhD at King’s College London. In 2018, he co-founded Extinction Rebellion (XR), which opened a new chapter in climate activism, based on civil disobedience and mass arrests, and took off in dozens of countries. But he is a divisive figure, as a recent documentary about XR Rebellion, shows, and was “unreservedly denounced” by Extinction Rebellion UK for describing the Holocaust as “just another fuckery in human history” in a 2019 interview. I am told that he is merely an “adviser” to Just Stop Oil. It is a surreal and disturbing experience to sit in a hall in a seaside town on a quiet Monday evening and listen to someone tell you that human civilisation is destined to collapse within your lifetime and not be able to say with any confidence that he is wrong. Hallam’s doomsday rhetoric might sometimes overshoot urgency and plunge into despair but consider the recent news items that have been overshadowed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The IPCC published a new report on the “irreversible” effects of exceeding 1.5C: heatwaves, floods, droughts, famine. “Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a livable future,” said the IPCC’s Hans-Otto Pörtner. Scientists at the University of Manchester urged oil and gas production to end completely in richer countries by 2034 and in poorer nations by 2050. In the Arctic and Antarctic, researchers recorded temperatures that were respectively 30C and 40C above seasonal norms. You could say that the activists who drop out of their careers and actively invite arrest are going to extremes, or you could say that they are responding rationally to an existential emergency. “I’m not sure that scaring people too much is a problem,” the writer and environmentalist George Monbiot tells me. “We’re not nearly scared enough, and that’s why we’re not acting. The complete decarbonisation of our economy is our only hope of avoiding systemic environmental collapse, and nothing like that is on the political agenda in the biggest economies.” At conferences such as Cop26, governments pledge to reduce consumption of fossil fuels while continuing to license new production. It might seem as if anxiety over soaring fuel bills and sanctions on Russian oil and gas make Just Stop Oil’s timing unfortunate, but Monbiot argues that these crises strengthen the case for ending reliance on financially and politically volatile sources of energy. “We can achieve energy independence from dictatorships and autocracies and independence from fossil fuels at the same time and by the same means,” he says. “What’s not to like?” Eastbourne is where I first meet Hannah Hunt, who delivers similar talks at universities and colleges, “but with a slightly softer touch than Roger’s doom-and-gloom approach,” she tells me later. The first time she saw one of Hallam’s talks, two years ago, she came home with her boyfriend and cried for two hours. “It is a tough line,” she says. “Some people think, OK, we are travelling towards the end of human civilisation and therefore I must act. Some want to bury their heads in the sand. I have been in both places, and I am sometimes in both places still, so I have empathy for both of those reactions. I tell people to channel those emotions into your desire to act.” Hunt tells the Eastbourne audience her own story. Growing up in the Lake District, she was always close to nature and sensitive to suffering on the news. “I’ve never been able to just stand by.” She was studying clinical psychology at the University of Sussex and working on an NHS eating disorder service throughout the pandemic. “Societal breakdown is Covid times 100, for ever,” she says. Last December, she dropped out of university to become a full-time activist. “I’m 23,” she tells me. “There are lots of other things I’d rather be doing. But we don’t have the luxury of time. We have in our house a countdown of how many days we’ve got, which is really motivating but also quite depressing. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I looked back in 10 years and I hadn’t taken action.” After Hallam’s talk, the audience breaks into two groups to discuss the new campaign. There are some doubts. “I feel very often like I’m pissing in the wind politically,” says one woman who was part of the Greenham Common peace camp in the 1980s. Another veteran activist, with CND and Greenpeace, complains that Insulate Britain’s strategy of blockading motorways last September was “counterproductive” and says that she doesn’t understand the relationship between XR, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. It’s a good question. One sunny afternoon three weeks later, I meet a 27-year-old Just Stop Oil organiser called Indigo Rumbelow on a bench in north London’s Lloyd Park. Speaking with quiet intensity and great care, she describes the intersection of the three groups as a Venn diagram. Just Stop Oil was formed last December in order to rejuvenate and refocus the overall campaign. “When you’re reaching a dead end, the correct thing to do is go into a period of creation and experimentation in order to engage new people,” Rumbelow says. She describes it as a non-hierarchical coalition of organisers, scientists, lawyers and former workers in the oil industry who collaborate on both demands and tactics. Activists then operate in autonomous blocs with shared resources but no formal leadership. All funding comes from donations. The goal is to raise awareness on a massive scale. “People have been writing petitions, going on marches, speaking to their MPs, joining NGOs, and it’s not just staying the same, it’s actually getting worse,” Rumbelow says. “People across society are really angry. We’ve tried all the democratic means of creating that change so now the only thing we can do is civil disobedience. It is upsetting to disrupt people but it’s far more upsetting to stay silent as we watch this horror unfold. If my brother woke me up because there was a fire in the middle of night, I wouldn’t be angry that he woke me up.” “It could be described as the politics of desperation,” George Monbiot says. “They’re desperately trying to draw attention towards the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced, in a society that is almost constitutionally unable to face it. We can’t leave them to do this on our behalf. We need to respond to our existential crisis with the biggest political mass movement there’s ever been.” Five days after Roger Hallam’s talk in Eastbourne, I attend a nonviolence training day in a room above a Methodist church in Leicester. Mya Baines (not her real name), a 34-year-old animator, and Karen Wildin, a 57-year-old private tutor, begin by asking the dozen or so attenders to introduce themselves. There is a vicar whose brother was arrested at an XR protest; a woman whose daughter dropped out of university after seeing Hallam speak; a rapper who admires Russell Brand. Baines then puts forward various scenarios and asks the group to say whether they qualify as violent, nonviolent or not being violent. The distinction is not always clear. “There is no proactive word for nonviolence,” writes Mark Kurlansky in Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea. Mahatma Gandhi coined the word satyagraha, or “truth force”, to describe his version of it. Gandhi’s example inspired Richard Gregg’s 1934 book The Power of Nonviolence, and Gregg in turn became a guiding influence on the American civil rights activists who began staging anti-segregation sit-ins in the 1940s. Gregg, a Quaker lawyer, described the strategy as “moral jiu-jitsu”: expecting physical resistance and receiving none, the opponent is unbalanced. Not being violent is passive; nonviolence is confrontational and uncomfortable. “I don’t like being disliked,” says Baines. “I’ve had to get used to being hated.” Activists such as Andreas Malm, author of How to Blow Up a Pipeline: Learning to Fight in a World on Fire, argue that violent protest, chiefly sabotage, is legitimate. Movements for women’s suffrage, the abolition of slavery and the end of apartheid all had violent flanks. Just Stop Oil, however, argues that nonviolence is both an ethical choice and a strategic one. In Why Civil Resistance Works, American academics Erica Chenoweth and Maria J Stephan demonstrate that nonviolence has a far greater chance of realising its aims than violence. Just Stop Oil weeds out any volunteer who might not to be able to sustain nonviolence under pressure. One man at the training day demonstrates how he would take down somebody who attacked him. “Maybe you shouldn’t take part in the action,” Baines gently suggests. Before she became an activist, Baines tells me, she was “very upset and depressed. I was trying to tell people about it and they weren’t listening. Then I saw Extinction Rebellion on the news and read about their theory of change.” She has since been arrested six times. “It’s odd what you can get used to doing. It’s not how I saw my life going but I feel like I’ve been left with no choice, and that’s how most people in Just Stop Oil feel.” De-escalators are usually women because they receive less abuse. An hour into the training day, four people arrive furiously late, having waited in the wrong room, and the mood is suddenly tense. The skill with which Baines defuses their irritation and welcomes them into the group is a fine example of everyday de-escalation. “Nonviolence training is an education in itself,” Wildin tells me. “When we encounter conflict within campaigns, we all try to apply our nonviolent approach to living.” Wildin threw herself into activism two years ago, after her children left home, and has since been arrested 22 times for a range of direct actions, including Stop HS2. “What I’ve discovered is that the laws are designed to protect property, profit and power,” she says. Christian Murray-Leslie came to activism even later than Wildin. A gently spoken 77-year-old retired NHS consultant, he describes himself as “slightly left of centre – not a headbanger”. He keeps bees and spends his evenings rescuing toads from the roads near his home in Devon. Since his first arrest at an XR protest in Parliament Square in September 2020, he has been arrested six times with Insulate Britain. Members of the public, Murray-Leslie says, are more frightening than the police because there is no set procedure. They tend to start by blowing horns and shouting abuse. Some then become violent, hitting or dragging protesters. The advice is to be apologetic but resolute, explaining why they are there. “What you do in the first two to three seconds is critical,” he says. “You need to show respect and answer their points without any trace of aggression.” A few months after an arrest, a charging letter arrives. Protesters are free to plead guilty and accept a fine but the organisers’ advice is to file a plea of not guilty, thus insisting on the legitimacy of the protest and tying up the court system. Most climate activists have been acquitted or seen their cases dismissed but at least 18 were jailed for contempt of court last year. A few days ago, 117 of the 174 Insulate Britain activists arrested last autumn were officially charged, mostly with causing a public nuisance. Unsurprisingly, most activists are under 30 or over 60. “There tends to be people who don’t have anything to lose and then people who have the freedom and financial stability to take those risks,” Baines says. “There are a lot of people who want to do it but they need to keep a roof over their heads.” Civil disobedience usually gets a bad press. Even people sympathetic to the cause, such as David Attenborough and Sadiq Khan, have criticised XR and Insulate Britain for alienating the general public with disruptive tactics. Activists counter that XR helped to inspire parliament to declare a climate emergency in May 2019, and Insulate Britain is the reason why Andrea Leadsom, former secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, recently described home insulation as “low-hanging fruit in the energy space”. Nonetheless, there is a sense that Just Stop Oil, by targeting the oil industry rather than the general public, will be less contentious. “I wish there was more focus on why we’re doing it and less on the tactics,” Baines says. “I’m not saying we shouldn’t be criticised – part of nonviolence training is being accountable for your actions – but we’re not disrupting people for the sake of it. We’re potentially looking at the collapse of civilisation and the government isn’t doing anything about it. If anything, I’d say we’re being quite restrained.” After lunch, it’s role play time. Two tables are placed end to end to represent an oil tanker and protesters are assigned roles: six sitting in the road, one on top of the tanker, and two locked on to the side. “I can’t smoke during this, which would be horrible for me,” jokes a middle-aged vicar. The next scenario is a road blockade, with half the group playing the part of angry drivers. “These fucking climate protesters!” shouts Baines with alarming conviction. “Who do they think they are? Wankers! Get a job!” They practise shielding one another from blows, “going floppy” so that they are harder to lift, and protecting themselves by lying on their right sides and covering their heads, although the weapons today are only bundles of rolled-up socks. “We never retaliate,” says Wildin. “We just take it.” At the end of the day, everyone is asked to say whether or not they’re prepared to face abuse and arrest by participating in an action. Some realise they are not ready and offer to serve in support roles. “It’s now or never but I can’t quite do it,” one woman says guiltily. “I think it’s about changing people’s hearts,” says another. “Maybe I’m a bit envious of your bravery but does it do any good?” A grey-haired woman called Viv, however, decides that she is all in. “The role play’s good because it deflects from being scared shitless,” she says cheerfully. “I’m ready to go.” Witnessing the action at Navigator inspires deja vu. I recognise almost every component from either the training day or the action meeting. “It’s an unbeatable, repeatable formula,” one activist tells me. Between the first blockade and another around the bend, a total of seven tankers are crowned with activists in orange hi-vis vests bearing Just Stop Oil’s calligram of a skull. The police mill around, waiting for backup. “What if they start smoking?” asks one officer. There’s just one deviation from the plan: one tanker driver threatens the banner-holding activists so ferociously that everyone ends up scaling a tanker for safety. In Leicester, I thought that the people role-playing angry drivers were laying it on a bit thick but if anything, they were far too mild. The abuse is astonishing: “If the police weren’t here, I’d come up and fucking throw you off myself!” “I hope one of them falls off and breaks their fucking neck.” And to an activist with a ladder: “You put that up there, mate, and I’m going to ram it down your fucking throat!” Driving a tanker with people on top may be illegal but one driver in the second blockade does it anyway, reversing slightly to create a gap in the road. Another drags down the road a young Irish woman, who curls up and shields her head. Pavel Ivanov claims that a third grabbed him by the throat. Half a dozen terminal workers form a chorus of hecklers: “You look like you’re just out of nappies!” “Go and get a fucking job!” Following nonviolence training to the letter, the activists apologise for the disruption and explain why they believe it is necessary. The response: “Shut up, you cunt.” After an hour, the drivers’ rage fizzles out. It’s obvious that nobody is going anywhere, and it is brutally cold. The only noises are the choppy drone of a police helicopter and the occasional crackle of a walkie-talkie. A few of the occupiers are curled up in sleeping bags. Snow is falling in light flurries. A strange peace descends on a frozen tableau. There are similar scenes at nine more simultaneous actions staged by Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion at sites around England. By early afternoon, ExxonMobil UK has been forced to suspend operations at four terminals. Three days later, the protests are still going on. At least 275 activists have been arrested, mostly at three sites in Essex, and there are petrol and diesel shortages across the south-east. When I catch up with Hunt and Ivanov over the phone, they tell me that a special police team erected scaffolding and began removing occupiers from the tankers on stretchers on Friday afternoon but that the last ones weren’t taken away until 3pm on Saturday. Meanwhile another team dug a tunnel under Navigator and two of them are still there. Around 35 activists were arrested for tampering with a vehicle and held in cells before being released on bail and banned from returning to Essex. “At the debrief everybody was in tears,” Ivanov says. “In a positive way. We’d held the site for 36 hours with an entirely youth-based team. Everybody’s really proud.” A few of them went home to rest and reflect. Most returned to the safe house and began planning their next action.",News/Environment,Just Stop Oil: behind the scenes with the activists,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/just-stop-oil-behind-the-scenes-with-the-activists
4/10/2022,"Among the various properties owned by the chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak and his wife Akshata Murty is Kirby Sigston Manor, an expansive Grade II-listed house in a small hamlet in rural North Yorkshire. It comes with sweeping grounds and a beautiful duckpond big enough to have an island. There are also plans for a swimming pool and tennis court for the Sunak family to enjoy on visits to the chancellor’s constituency. On Friday there appeared to be no one home, domiciled or otherwise. In the garden a union jack flapped gently in the wind on its flagpole, but the only sound of activity came from the quacking ducks. Ten miles away in Northallerton, a sturdy, well-heeled and solidly Conservative market town also in Sunak’s Richmond constituency, there was a similar air of calm. While many at Westminster and in the national media frothed at the revelation that Murty was claiming non-domiciled tax status, and therefore was not paying UK taxes on her very considerable overseas earnings, initial impressions on Northallerton’s streets suggested people were overwhelmingly unfussed. And this despite estimates that the UK exchequer, which Murty’s husband happens to oversee, has been £20m lighter over the past seven years than it would have been had his extremely rich wife been registered to pay the tax in this country, where she lives most of the time. “She’s not even in the government,” said Margaret Williams. “She pays tax in her country [India], and she expects to be returning home.” Seldom could a front-page story in most of the papers have had so little impact on a community. “It’s a non-issue,” remarked Steve Tomkinson. “It’s her choice.” It’s as if they were residents of certain quarters of South Kensington in London, where the proportion of non-doms is as high as 20 per cent. “I’m afraid to say it’s the mainstream media,” explained Jo Keighley, who used to work in education. “It’s nothing to do with domicile tax. It’s all politics. We live in an age of constant leaking and disloyalty.” If opinion in the wider Conservative party, country and media had been equally supportive – and understanding – of the Sunaks’ decisions over tax and residency issues, then the chancellor would still be sitting pretty in the No 10 succession stakes. As it is, last week’s events have capped a disastrous couple of weeks for the chancellor, the worst of his political career by a mile. His chances of becoming the next Tory leader and prime minister have nose-dived, to the point where if a contest were to be held in the next few months, few Conservatives now believe he would be in with a realistic chance. As one senior figure on the backbenches put it, there could not be a worse time for Sunak to have his wealth and tax affairs on all the front pages and news bulletins. “This is an illustration of how quickly political fortunes can change. The problem for him is one of timing. If you think how much he has put taxes up, and that we have a very serious cost of living crisis, it is not good for him to have this going on.” The latest Opinium poll for the Observer today finds that Sunak’s approval rating has dropped to a new low of -15, making him only slightly less unpopular than Boris Johnson, as inflation surges and taxes go up. Just four months ago, Sunak’s approval rating stood at a very healthy +11. Now, however, the worry for Conservative MPs – particularly those with small majorities – is that the shine has gone off not only the prime minister, but his chancellor. Talk of rifts between the two grow by the day, as Johnson pushes to spend more to get the economy moving and Sunak tries to rein him in. From the moment it was revealed, in the middle of last week, that Murty was a non dom and was therefore choosing not to pay UK tax on income from her shareholding – estimated to be worth £690m – in her father’s multibillion-pound Infosys business empire, most Conservative MPs could sense the position was unsustainable. Only two weeks before, Sunak had refused to lift benefits by the rate of inflation for millions in his widely criticised spring statement, meaning that from 11 April those receiving help from the state will suffer a reduction in their real-terms income that the Joseph Rowntree Trust says amounts to “the greatest fall in the value of the basic rate of unemployment benefit since 1972”. Writing on the Conservative Home website on Friday, the former Tory MP Paul Goodman warned the Sunaks that holding firm and then giving in to pressure would damage them most of all politically. “The very worst thing that can happen is to dig in and then have to give way and I wonder if that is what will happen here,” he wrote. Sunak had appeared in the Sun that morning in defiant mode, accusing those who criticised his wife of peddling “unpleasant smears”. “Rishi: Lay Off My Missus” was the front page headline. Friends of Sunak were quoted anonymously in the media as saying No 10 was briefing against Sunak because he had been distinctly unsupportive of Johnson during Partygate when a leadership contest seemed on the cards. The implication of Sunak’s Sun interview was that because his wife had acted within the law and it was her money, it was no one else’s business and nothing would change. But that evening – as it was also emerging that Sunak had held a US green card for 19 months of his time as chancellor and six years as an MP (meaning he had declared himself as a permanent US resident for tax purposes during that period) – Murty issued a statement. She announced she would pay UK taxes on her overseas income after all, not because she had to, but because she wanted to and because she recognised that not doing so was contrary to the “British sense of fairness”. She would, however, remain a non dom, meaning she would still be able to take advantage of rules that could permit her in future to avoid inheritance tax of more than £275m. If Murty and the chancellor think her change of mind will be the end of the controversy and restore his fortunes quickly, senior figures in the Conservative party are not convinced. As one former Tory cabinet minister put it, the whole episode had raised questions not so much about their wealth or tax arrangements, but about Sunak’s political savvy. “It is not so much about money, though that is difficult, it is the matter of judgment. That is what colleagues are concerned about, what it says about his judgment. I would say he is certainly damaged.” How was it that someone who wanted to run the country could have allowed his personal affairs and those of his wife to be arranged in a way that one day would, inevitably, come to light? Another Tory MP said that what would worry colleagues with small majorities most was that both the prime minister and chancellor had now lost their shine, and both were under clouds at a time of severe economic difficulty for the country. Sunak’s mishaps and misjudgments had sowed seeds of doubts even before the non-dom furore. While he was credited with introducing the hugely costly furlough scheme early on in the pandemic, which cost a total of around £70bn, “eat out to help out” was seen as a big error in the fight against Covid that encouraged people to socialise before it was really safe to do so. Several of his small PR stunts have backfired since, often because they raised the subject of his wealth. In a pre-budget photo opportunity in July 2020 he was photographed with a “smart mug” costing £180. Then to coincide with last month’s spring statement in which he cut fuel duty he was photographed filling up a Kia Rio only for it to be revealed that the car had been borrowed from a worker at the petrol station and that the Sunaks’ fleet of vehicles consisted of a top-of-the-range Range Rover, a BMW and a very smart Lexus. Shortly after the spring statement, as controversy raged about his refusal to do more for the poorest in the country, it was revealed that the Sunaks would be heading to their luxury apartment in California for an Easter break. The result of the past week, in particular, is that Sunak is now associated every bit as much with wealth – he himself set up a successful hedge fund before entering politics in which it is believed he may still retain a stake – as Boris Johnson is with lockdown-breaking parties at Downing Street. The opposition parties now have a new, second target to aim at alongside Johnson – the chancellor who refuses to help those on benefits while protecting his own family’s wealth from the tax man. When parliament returns after the Easter break, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party will demand transparency over the chancellor’s personal finances at every turn. Back in his own constituency, while most people seem to be Sunak supporters, there are some who are beginning to turn and form the opinion that their MP like Johnson, practises “do as I say, not as I do” politics. One is Phil Eames, who is mayor of Northallerton. “I’m speaking personally, not in an official capacity,” said Eames, “but I think it’s disgusting, hypocritical and out-of-touch. It’s up to leaders to set an example.” There are others too. For Helen, who has a young child and has had to return to work to pay the bills, the point is that as a politician, you must carry the can and show responsible leadership, not feather your own nest. “What your family does reflects on you, whether that’s right or not. When you’re in that kind of position you take on that kind of responsibility,” she said.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak’s stunts and mistakes expose lack of political savvy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/10/rishi-sunaks-stunts-and-mistakes-expose-lack-of-political-savvy
4/10/2022,"It was a courtroom drama with two towering protagonists. In one corner stood a record mogul with a history of violence and Mafia links who was notorious for stealing musicians’ work. In the other corner stood a Beatle. The battle between John Lennon and Morris Levy, the boss of Roulette Records and inspiration for a ruthless music mogul in The Sopranos, played out over several months and culminated in 1976 in New York’s district court. It attracted little attention at the time, but now the lawyer who represented Lennon at the hearing has told the inside story of the case, revealing details of how his client prepared for the trial and his determination to stand up for fellow musicians who had been cheated out of their royalties Jay Bergen, who was a trial lawyer in New York City for 45 years, told the Observer: “That was one of the reasons John did not want to settle. He wanted to try to put an end to some of these really bogus lawsuits and a pattern of managers, publishers and record companies who stole royalties from their artists, particularly the black artists.” Levy was notorious within the music industry and beyond: he beat up a policeman, causing him to lose an eye, but the criminal case disappeared mysteriously from court records before being brought to trial. He was a “business” associate of Vincent “The Chin” Gigante, the reputed head of the Genovese crime family, and inspired the character of ruthless record label boss Hesh Rabkin in The Sopranos. In May, Bergen is publishing Lennon, the Mobster & the Lawyer: The Untold Story, which draws on thousands of pages of trial testimony and notes. They were stored in his garage and, returning to them recently, he realised that Beatles “fans would love reading the testimony” because it is a largely “untold story”: “I have all of the transcripts, and I spent hours and hours with John.” Bergen’s copious notes record Lennon telling him: “I want to be rid of him. I’m tired of these phoney legal cases. I want to put a stop to them… I don’t want to do any deals with Morris. He wants to cheat me like he’s cheated other singers and songwriters.” The case was sparked after Levy claimed that the Lennon and McCartney song Come Together infringed the copyright on Chuck Berry’s You Can’t Catch Me, owned by Levy’s publishing company, Big Seven Music. It centred on a few words from the lyrics, despite different connotations: Berry’s “Here come a flattop” referred to a convertible, and Lennon’s “Here come old flat top” referred to a man who once had a crew cut. But it was just another of Levy’s “threaten-and-settle scams”, a way to get his hooks into John Lennon, Bergen said. To stop the case going to court, Lennon had agreed to record three of Levy’s classic songs on his Rock ’n’ Roll oldies album, on which he had been working. As Levy kept pestering him, Lennon gave him “rough mix” recordings, telling him: “They’re not the final version of my album. I might have to delete some crummy tracks.” To his dismay, Lennon was cheated. Levy released them as an unauthorised record, Roots, claiming that they had a verbal agreement. The clash led to a lawsuit and countersuit between them. While all the world’s media and legions of fans would today be drawn to such a case, it received relatively little attention then, Bergen recalled. On the first day, the only spectators were Bergen’s mother and aunt, while he lunched with Lennon every day and only once did someone ask for an autograph. They regularly walked the streets without being accosted. He remembers telling Lennon that the judge was a classical music lover who played the harpsichord: “We’ll plan your direct testimony so it’ll be a tutorial on the Beatles. It’s important that he knows what you and the other Beatles have accomplished.” Lennon replied: “It’ll be easy for me to communicate with him about music. That’s wonderful that he plays the harpsichord.” Lennon threw himself into preparing for the trial, giving a testimony that detailed his creative process. He spoke of having “a pretty good reason” for choosing each song on the Rock ’n’ Roll album: “Be-Bop-A-Lula was one of the first songs I ever learned, and I actually remember singing it the day I met Paul McCartney… Ain’t That A Shame was the first rock and roll song I ever learned. My mother taught it to me on the banjo before I learned the guitar. Nobody else knows these reasons except me.” He dismissed the unauthorised record as “shoddy”, arguing that the Beatles “would not let something that looked or smelled like this be anywhere near the public”. On 10 August 1976, the final judgment dismissed the claims against Lennon, awarding over $400,000 in damages against Levy and his company to both Lennon and Capitol/EMI. Bergen said that Levy’s bullying had failed spectacularly: “Many executives, artists and managers feared him. His underhand methods and mafia connections were well known. Yet John Lennon had shut him down.” He writes: “In 1986, a federal investigation into organised crime’s involvement in the record business led to a 117-count New Jersey indictment of 17 individuals. Levy [was] indicted on extortion charges… and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Two months before he was to begin his prison sentence in 1990, he died of colon cancer.” Bergen described Lennon as the best witness he ever represented or put on the stand: “John rarely forgot anything we discussed. He never let the questioner push him around or intimidate him, but he also never showed obvious anger.”",Arts/Music,Beatle v mobster: the day John Lennon put paid to a shady record label boss,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/10/john-lennon-morris-levy-beatle-v-mobster-1976-court-battle
4/10/2022,"The rumbles started early on Friday morning. This was 10 days early, to which I took affront. We’ve been booked in for a C-section for a month, and I guess part of me rationalised that, once we had the date agreed – even written down in my Google calendar, in case I had other things going on and forgot – the baby would hold up her end of the deal. I’d like any child of mine to be punctual, so my first worry was what kind of antisocial ingrate we’d raised. The sort of early-bird weirdo who shows up to a 2pm barbecue at 1pm, and ends up drinking beers in the garden while their grumbling hosts get dressed and start preparing the food. For shame. Soon, rumbles became a clearer, more consistent pain and it was clear that my wife was having, if not contractions, something that looked, walked and quacked like contractions. Having spent the best part of the last month saying how ready we were for the pregnancy to be over, we suddenly discovered the limits of this readiness. We entered battle mode, hastily helming a plan. I called my sister Maeve, who drove to our house to collect the boy, who was delighted at the prospect of spending more time with his cousins and particularly his uncle Jimmy, who he would like to be his father much more than myself. I packed a getaway bag we reckoned would do us for a two-day hospital stay, and packed it again on top of the bed once my wife realised this was what I was doing and she hadn’t been consulted. She advised a few key changes to my roster of items – fewer chargers, more toiletries – and called the delivery unit, who told us to come in immediately. My wife’s first pregnancy went over by two whole weeks. That birth was preceded by five days in hospital in which doctors produced various procedures and treatments to evict the baby, as if they were police and he was an environmental campaigner who’d chained himself to a tree on the proposed site of an out-of-town Ikea. This was, of course, nail-biting in its own way, but it lacked the alarm and haste of the labour scenes we’d seen in movies: waters breaking, blue lights flashing, legs up on a trolley being pushed through swinging hospital doors. And now here we were, in movie labour, braced for the excitement of a slightly more cinematic birth. The doctors felt my wife’s belly, and their initial diagnosis was that she was pregnant, which was a relief, but that her contractions were pre-emptory efforts, and the birth less imminent than we supposed. At 6pm, we were told to go home and wait it out. Maeve and Jimmy told us to leave the boy with them, since he and his cousins were too excited about the sleepover to have it denied now. This he proved by loudly cheering in the background at this news. We returned to a childless house for the first time since he was born, edgy but – if we’re honest – utterly delighted by the calm. Collapsing into our quiet bed, I noticed the toothbrushes, underpants and makeup bag I’d forgot to pack earlier and stowed them in the getaway bag before she saw. Now, I thought. Now, we’ll be ready.

4/10/2022,"The Split (BBC One) | BBC iPlayerArt That Made Us (BBC Two) | BBC iPlayerHouse of Maxwell (BBC Two) | BBC iPlayer If there’s one thing I find heartening in a chaotic world, it’s the escapist thrill of watching a programme crafted by a creative talent at the very top of their game. Which is a roundabout way of saying: Abi Morgan’s The Split is back. The last time we were in the company of the female-lawyer-dominated Defoe family, oldest sister Hannah had finally come clean about her affair with dashing colleague, Christie. Her husband, Nathan, moved in with Hannah’s youngest sister, Rose, and her endearingly nerdy partner, James. Rose then worried about her James splitting up, except they are the true sensible heart of The Split and would never. Middle sister Nina decided that she didn’t want to be with Rex, the father of her baby, and would raise it alone. Except that, technically, she wasn’t alone, because she started snogging Tyler (also a lawyer), who had just married a man. So, my choice of escapism appears to be quite chaotic, too. The Split is unusual in that it’s a legal drama with barely a courtroom scene. Instead, the action takes place in enviable London townhouses, around kitchen islands with the same footprints as studio flats. Or in corner offices within touching distance of the Shard. The costume department works with an endless supply of Oxford shirts. It’s all fabulously and unapologetically glamorous, but the issues run the full gamut of life and love, among the Defoes themselves and their clients: weddings, affairs, miscarriages, drinking problems, estranged parents, snogging in swimming pools. The opening episode of this third and final series has Hannah hovering her pen over her divorce papers and intermittently removing and reinstating her wedding ring. Unfortunately for her, Nathan seems to have moved on, which becomes abundantly clear when he presents his new girlfriend to her at dinner – a hot but sanctimonious child psychologist (“a kid shrink”) who refers to children as “little people”. Nicola Walker – for years and years one of the best actors on British television screens – and Stephen Mangan continue to be superb, but everyone is. It’s testament to Morgan’s reputation and ever-sharp writing that The Split has attracted cameos from the likes of Anna Chancellor, Anthony Head and Meera Syal, who was particularly affecting in the last series. This opener includes the characteristic lightness (a countess with a penchant for BDSM) and the wrenching darkness: the episode ends with the unexpected death of a beloved character, which blows this final series wide open. All six episodes are available on iPlayer. If great art is heartening, then BBC Two’s new eight-part series Art That Made Us, looking at the history of Britain via an entire sweep of the arts (literature, art, music, drama, design – the lot), is a balm. It sets out to credit the cultural achievements and relevance of all people of these isles, not just the dominant Anglo-Saxons: “History is always written by the victors, and it’s the Anglo-Saxons who won.” The actor Michael Sheen, in the opening episode, is one person who has long been keen to redress this imbalance, and gives a typically powerful performance of Welsh poetry. Art That Made Us is the kind of programme the BBC and Channel 4 do so well; the kind of programme that, should the government’s attempt to privatise Channel 4 prove successful, would be at significant risk. Shareholders probably won’t have much time for the fabulous “medieval graphic novels in needlework” featured here. Finally, to the Maxwell family – again – who you might, by now, be thoroughly sick of. Last year’s Epstein’s Shadow Sky documentary on Ghislaine – who last week had her retrial petition denied – was as thin as prison gruel. Its main talking head was Anna Pasternak, an Oxford contemporary whose actual connection to Maxwell seemed to amount to a passing nod at an end-of-term bop. BBC Two’s three-part House of Maxwell, as its name suggests, focuses on the whole gang. The first episode covers the transformation of Czechoslovakia-born Ján Ludvík Hyman Binyamin Hoch from humble village lad to charismatic and control-freak media magnate Robert Maxwell, KGB and MI6 informer (bonus fact: also Mossad). Maxwell’s famous belligerence and competitive obsession with Rupert Murdoch is detailed, and there’s nothing new in that. But there are some interesting scenes; it helps that this was a man with such ego that he employed a camera crew to accompany him everywhere. In one clip he chastises the Mirror Group’s staff on its lack of women. He appointed Eve Pollard, who contributes here, as Sunday Mirror editor. (Lest this make Maxwell seem a feminist hero, his preference for working with women was, he once said, because he viewed them as “extensions of the boss”.) The production team has pulled off the coup of gaining access to the panicked executive phone calls during the hours of Maxwell’s disappearance off his yacht in 1991 – although this is undermined by the cringey re-enactments. In truth, they don’t add much. (Most are variations of: “Where the hell is all the money?!”) Perhaps the best bit is Maxwell’s long-suffering secretary Carol Bragoli describing how she once overheard a conversation (I use the term loosely) between Maxwell and his daughter in which they miaowed at each other for a significant length of time. “Ten miaows,” Bragoli confirms, with a look that tells us she truly did see some things. Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story(Netflix)Frankly, I’m not watching this, as I’d rather swim in a sewer than spend five more minutes in the company of the shell-suited creep, but nonetheless this will be a talking point. News lines have mostly focused on the fact that Savile once produced a personal media relations “handbook” to help his royal friends. Judging by recent events it wasn’t very well read. Dirty Lines(Netflix) I’m a sucker for a 1980s European-set drama, and Netflix’s much-anticipated true tale of the establishment of the first ever erotic phone line (conceived in Amsterdam, obviously) fits the bill. Backcombed hair, a new wave soundtrack, shoulder pads wider than a dual carriageway and orgasms dramatically rendered to rival Meg Ryan. “Welcome to the revolution, baby.” The Boot Room Boys(BT Sport)I may be biased as a huge Liverpool FC fan, but any football, or indeed, sports fan should enjoy this look at the club’s unique heritage. Packed full of carefully curated archive footage and presented by the Farm frontman (and massive Red) Peter Hooton, The Boot Room Boys features former playing legends such as Phil Thompson, but also current heroes, and the current hero: Jürgen Klopp. A great watch to prepare for the club winning a famous cup quadruple this season.

4/10/2022,"Their forgeries of 20th-century masters such as Max Ernst and Fernand Léger duped the art world into parting with millions of pounds – until a modern pigment gave them away. Now, after serving lengthy prison sentences, Wolfgang Beltracchi and his wife Helene have told the story behind the hundreds of paintings that tricked even the artists’ families. In interviews with Jeannette Fischer, a Zurich-based psychoanalyst and author, the couple described their motivation for fooling what they believed was a “fraudulent” art world. Wolfgang said he had never forged pictures with compositions that would unnerve the onlooker. “I have to create something beautiful … I want to make people happy,” he said. He described forgery as “almost incidental”: “We enjoyed selling the paintings. We got a kick out of it. We got rich,” he said. “I got to paint, and we enjoyed doing the research too. Forgery was a way of combining all these things. And I got to sit around the pool for days, reading and daydreaming and sleeping.” Helene added: “The more successful we were in selling the pictures, the higher we set the bar and the more extra stories we came up with, because we were really enjoying this game. Sometimes we laid trails so elaborate that nobody would ever have discovered them.” She recalled approaching an auction-house expert with a forged painting by Georges Valmier, the French artist and early cubist. “I was pretty nervous. What if she rejected [it]? We made up a story to explain the provenance of the picture. I was amazed at how easy the whole thing was. My heart was in my mouth – but I got a kick out of it, too. The painting was put up for auction as ‘the most important work of the period of synthetic cubism’.” Such was their success that, when they sold one of their Ernst forgeries to a collector for $7m, they learned the artist’s widow had described it as as one of his best forest pictures. They received almost €2m for a forged painting by André Derain, which a London gallery sold for more than $6m. Fischer’s research will appear in a forthcoming book, Psychoanalyst Meets Helene and Wolfgang Beltracchi, to be published this spring. Observing that “the Beltracchis see the art market itself as a fraudulent business”, she writes: “In their view, they were cheating those who made a living by cheating others.” Beltracchi was born as Wolfgang Fischer in Hoxter, Germany, in 1951 and learned his craft by helping his father restore paintings in churches. Aged 12, he copied a Picasso. By the time he met Helene, he had been forging paintings for 20 years – when they fell in love, he confessed his secret and they became partners in crime and married in 1993, taking her surname. His talent extended to imitating numerous artists, including Heinrich Campendonk, the German expressionist, and André Derain, the French fauvist. Forged labels from galleries or collections heightened the authenticity. The Beltracchis spent months researching the artist’s life, creating paintings that related to “lost” works or “gaps” in their oeuvre. Wolfgang said: “Ernst was a very typical example. He always painted series, always in a specific way. In one series, for example, he painted crowds, and in the next forests. So what was missing was a painting featuring crowds and forests together. A transition picture, you might say. And that’s the picture I painted.” He spoke of having a “physical reaction” to paintings. “I read the handwriting by seeing and feeling every movement of his body, reading his state of mind from the brushstrokes, because handwriting is made up of movement and time.” Helene explained that they travelled to the places where such pictures were painted and at the same time of year. “When you’re actually there, you can really feel what it was like and you can imagine how the painter stood or sat or lived and which influences he was exposed to.” The couple recalled laying a “brilliant trail” in faking a photograph of a still life exhibition that was held in Berlin in 1924 to give the impression that their forged Léger painting had been on its walls. Beltracchi said: “The exhibition really happened, but there were no photos of it – and of course my forged picture wasn’t really there.” For him, “the cherry on the cake” was a note he had forged between the gallery’s deceased former owner and a collector known to have bought from him. The owner’s son identified his father’s signature “straight away”. Fischer writes: “The fact that everything had always gone so smoothly may have made Wolfgang Beltracchi a little careless. For his last picture, he used the wrong white. That was the beginning of the end of the Beltracchis’ career as forgers.” In 2008, analysis of their forged Campendonk painting – Rotes Bild mit Pferden (Red Picture with Horses), which had sold for a record price of €2.8m in 2006 – revealed traces of titanium white, a pigment that was not used by the supposed painter in 1914. Beltracchi had run out of zinc, which he used to mix with his white colour himself, and he bought a pure zinc white from a Dutch manufacturer that did not disclose that the paint contained traces of titanium white. That was his “fatal error”. It sparked a police investigation. Panic spread through the art world and, in 2011, a German court sentenced Wolfgang and Helene to six and four years respectively. Asked what most surprised her about the couple, Fischer said: “That they bought liberty and free time with the money they organised for themselves through the scam. No Ferrari, no Prada dresses, but free space to go to museums, to look after the children, to pursue their passion for research.”",Arts/Art and design,‘We got a kick out of it’: art forgers reveal secrets of paintings that fooled experts,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/10/we-got-a-kick-out-of-it-art-forgers-reveal-secrets-of-paintings-that-fooled-experts
