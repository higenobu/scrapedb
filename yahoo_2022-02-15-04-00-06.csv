2/15/2022,"The Sarasota Medical Examiner’s office has released the official autopsy report for doomed “van-lifer” Brian Laundrie, revealing new details into his death. The report, conducted by District 12 deputy chief medical examiner Dr. Wilson Broussard, states that Laundrie died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. When the FBI finally found him days into his disappearance, he was discovered near a European American Arms revolver, which was marked as a .38 special on one side of the barrel and as a .357 magnum on the other, the report states. “The cylinder contained two live rounds and one spent round of ammunition,” the report states, noting that Laundrie had been partly eaten by animals by the time his remains were discovered in a Florida swamp. Confirming an account made by an attorney representing Laundrie’s family after his remains were discovered in October, the report provides new details into how authorities found the 23-year-old at the Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park. At the time, Laundrie was charged in the disappearance and death of his fiancee, Gabby Petito, in a case that garnered national attention.

Petito’s remains were eventually found in a Wyoming national park on Sept. 19, after authorities say she died by strangulation. But some of the details of Laundrie’s death have remained a mystery. The report notes that when authorities found Laundrie on Oct. 21, 2021, they discovered his remains in plain sight along a trail in the Carlton Reserve. There was evidence that approximately three feet of water had kept Laundrie’s remains hidden from investigators for weeks. According to the report, much of Laundrie’s corpse had “moderately extensive carnivore activity evidenced by multiple gouging and gnawing marks,” according to the ME. “These areas are consistent with carnivores and/or omnivores including canines such as feral dogs and coyotes along with rodents and raccoons.” The remains included a “right and left scapulae, right humerus, right femur, two tibiae, two fibulae, two clavicles, two pelvic bones, the sacrum, one right ulna, one right radius, and multiple ribs” the report continues. “Also, multiple fragments of cranium and skull along with a generally intact mandible with attached teeth and the lower aspect of the maxilla with attached teeth are noted. Cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae are also located nearby.” Investigators had to confirm Laundrie’s identity using dental records and DNA analysis. Among Laundrie’s personal effects were a pair of green shorts, two slip-on shoes, a white metal ring, and the rusted handgun. A few feet away, searchers discovered a green backpack, a tent and flares, as well as a piece of paper and a red hat with the logo “Moab Coffee Roasters.” About 150 feet southwest of the area, cops found “a journal along with a wooden box that contained a small notebook and photographs, some of the photos include Brian Laundrie.” Laundrie was in one of the photos, the report states.

2/15/2022,"The post Chevy Chase: “I Don’t Care” That Casts of SNL, Community Hated Working with Him appeared first on Consequence. Chevy Chase is 78-years-old and just as charming (?) as ever. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the notoriously prickly comedian was asked about his many former cast mates on Saturday Night Live and Community who have voiced displeasure at their time together, and he shrugged it off, saying, “I don’t care.” During the interview, Chase recalled John Belushi’s penchant for giving him the finger in photographs. He also famously got into a fight with Bill Murray in Belushi’s dressing room, and fought with Community creator Dan Harmon about the direction of his character Pierce Hawthorne, dropping the N-word during one heated interaction. Donald Glover has also recalled many racist interactions with Chase, including being told, “People think you’re funnier because you’re Black.” But Chase is unfazed by this criticism. “I don’t give a crap!” he laughed. “I am who I am. And I like who I am. I don’t care. And it’s part of me, that I don’t care. And I’ve thought about that a lot. And I don’t know what to tell you, man. I just don’t care.” Elsewhere in the interview, Chase said he left SNL because he “hated it,” and added, “I felt pretty strongly that I was the funniest.” He was also asked about how his heart was holding up after a five-week hospital stay for cardiac issues last spring. “Oh we removed it,” he replied. “Didn’t need it. It’s much better now.” Check out the full interview below. Chevy Chase: “I Don’t Care” That Casts of SNL, Community Hated Working with Him

2/15/2022,"Trump called Collins ""absolutely atrocious"" while also seeking to claim responsibility for her 2020 victory. He claimed she ""didn't help the fisherman"" or ""the lumberjacks"" in Maine. The New York Times reported that Collins is helping to recruit anti-Trump Senate candidates. Former President Donald Trump tore into Republican Sen. Susan Collins on Monday after The New York Times reported that the Maine lawmaker was helping to recruit anti-Trump Republican candidates to run for Senate. ""Funny thing about Susan Collins, who is absolutely atrocious, and has been for a long time,"" Trump said at the start of his statement. The Times reported on Sunday that Collins was working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to woo candidates like Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a prominent anti-Trump figure in the party who recently declined to challenge Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen. ""No one should be afraid of President Trump, period,"" Collins told The Times. She won in 2020 without ever endorsing Trump, and has declined to say who she actually voted for. Trump, for his part, did endorse Collins, telling reporters in September 2020 that ""I hope she does well."" More broadly, though, McConnell is hoping to diminish Trump's influence in the party, in part to avoid unelectable what he called ""goofballs"" from costing Republicans otherwise winnable Senate races, according to The Times. The former president pointed out that he won Maine's 2nd congressional district, earning him one of the state's four Electoral College votes. Trump also claimed to have remained silent on ""the fisherman"" and ""the lumberjacks,"" saying Collins would have lost if he'd raised these issues. ""Just one word about her and the fact that she didn't help the fisherman, as their rights were taken from them from the federal government, and the lumberjacks, she would have had no chance to win,"" Trump said in his statement. ""But I remained silent and positive and allowed her to have her victory."" ""She would have lost in a landslide,"" Trump added. ""Gee, aren't I nice?"" It wasn't clear what Trump was referring to, though The Hill reported that the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a new rule to give Maine's fishing industry more time to adopt cleaner engines while Trump was president. He also issued a memo to the Department of Agriculture directing them to review financial aid to lobstermen who were financially impacted by his trade war with China. Collins supported both measures, according to the Hill. Insider has reached out to Trump for comment and clarification. Trump's comments on Collins' performance in 2020 are belied by the fact that she outperformed him statewide by over 56,000 votes, winning her Senate race against well-funded challenger Sara Gideon by over 8.5 percentage points while Trump lost to President Joe Biden by over 9 percentage points. Reached for comment, Collins' communications director Annie Clark pointed out the lawmaker's victory in Maine even though her party's presidential nominee lost the state. That's ""something she has done three times, the only sitting senator to do so,"" Clark said. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Trump calls Sen.

2/15/2022,"Convoys that local media said were inspired by Canadian demonstrations set off toward Jerusalem from cities across Israel on Monday, February 14, in protest against the state of emergency declared in the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Local media reported the trucks, tractors, cars, and motorcycles planned to travel to the Knesset in Jerusalem. According to Haaretz, dozens of vehicles briefly blocked a main highway and hung signs on their cars reading “liberty,” “no more restrictions, going back to normal,” “cancel the mask mandate” and other phrases. The newspaper said some protesters traveled as part of the convoy into Jerusalem, while others stopped at junctions and bridges along Route 1 to demonstrate. This video filmed by Yuval Avraham shows protesters against COVID-19 restrictions at the side of a road in Jerusalem on Monday.
