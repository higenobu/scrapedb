4/9/2022,"Residents remaining in eastern Ukraine’s embattled city of Luhansk must evacuate, the governor has said as shelling intensifies and Russia bolsters its forces. Ukraine has been warning that Moscow is withdrawing from areas to the north of Kyiv in order to focus its offensive military operations on the country’s east. Moscow, which initially justified its invasion by claiming to need to protect Russian-speaking civilians in the self-proclaimed republics in Donbas, has confirmed the change in strategy. Governor Serhiy Gaidai said about 30% of residents had stayed in the area’s cities and villages despite being asked to leave. “They [Russia] are amassing forces for an offensive and we see the number of shellings has increased,” Gaidai told public television. Russian operations continue to focus on the south-eastern parts of the country, targeting Donbas, Mariupol and Mykolaiv, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. The attacks are “supported by continued cruise missile launches into Ukraine by Russian naval forces”, according to its latest intelligence update. It said it expected Russian air activity “to increase in the south and east of Ukraine in support of this activity” but that forces had failed to establish a land corridor between Crimea and Donbas. With Russia’s offensive refocused, the US has warned that Moscow likely plans to deploy tens of thousands of soldiers in eastern Ukraine. “At this juncture we believe Russia is revising its war aims” to concentrate on “eastern and parts of southern Ukraine rather than target most of the territory,” President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said earlier this week. Calls for residents to evacuate Luhansk follow a missile strike on a railway station in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine on Friday. The attack on Kramatorsk station killed at least 50 people, including five children, who were waiting to evacuate. Blaming Russia for the attack, Volodymyr Zelenskiy labelled the strike a war crime and said it must be included at any future tribunal over the invasion. Russia has denied responsibility. Zelenskiy said he expected “a firm, global response”. “Like the massacre in Bucha, like many other Russian war crimes, the missile strike on Kramatorsk must be one of the charges at the tribunal, which is bound to happen,” he said on Friday night. The Tochka-U rocket landed outside the main station building where 4,000 people were waiting to be evacuated on Friday, wounding 87 people in addition to the dozens killed. Many have lost limbs and are in a critical condition, overwhelming the city’s hospital. The authorities had urged people to leave before a Russian military assault expected from next week. After the strike, the Ukrainian leader once again called on allies to supply Ukraine with more weapons, and for greater sanctions to be imposed on Russia. “The pressure on Russia must be increased. It is necessary to introduce a full energy embargo – on oil, on gas. It is energy exports that provide the lion’s share of Russia’s profits. Russian banks must also be completely disconnected from the global financial system.” Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of Donetsk oblast, accused Russia of carrying out the attack in order to “sow panic and fear” and to kill as many civilians as possible. “The enemy knew that this is a city, that this is a crowd of people, this is a railway station,” he said. Amid the mounting atrocities emerging from the invasion, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, Olga Stefanishyna, has said she expects her country to be granted EU candidate country status in June. She said her country was “ready to move fast” with its application to become a member of the bloc. Stefanishyna’s remarks come a day after the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, pledged to offer a speedy response to Ukraine’s attempt to join the union, telling Zelenskiy she thought it would be “a matter of weeks”. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed for Saturday, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said. She said the planned corridors included one for people evacuating by private transport from the besieged city of Mariupol, which has been under constant fire since 24 February. Over the weeks, several attempts to evacuate the approximately 150,000 civilians remaining in Mariupol and bring in vital provisions have ended in failure. Remaining residents face a humanitarian catastrophe, cut off from supplies of water, food and power.",News/World news,Luhansk residents told to evacuate as Russia moves focus to east Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/russia-east-ukraine-luhansk-residents-evacuate
4/9/2022,"Born in Luton in 1956, Paul Young is the heart-throb responsible for some of the biggest chart hits of the 1980s. After the breakup of new wave soul group the Q-Tips, Young went solo, providing the opening vocals on Band Aid’s Do They Know It’s Christmas? and releasing the transatlantic smash Every Time You Go Away and the multimillion-selling duet with Zucchero, Senza una donna (Without a Woman). Paul Young and Go West tour the UK in May; he takes The Essential 80s Tour with T’Pau and Hue And Cry on the road in the autumn. This was one of those endless teen magazine photoshoots. I have a vague memory of the photographer asking me to stand like that; it was quite a tight-fitting jacket made of a stiff suede so it was difficult to lift my arms up high. The clothes were bought at Johnson’s on the King’s Road, where Adam Ant got all his mad suits from. I would have styled my own hair, too – I’m quite particular about it. Even today, I’ve got the right kind of product, so if it blows about it goes back to its original place. The 80s were quite a peacocking era of masculinity, but I was tame by comparison, especially if you look at a group like Def Leppard. The hair products needed to keep them and some of those American guys on the go were quite something. I was probably a tempered version of the time, which reflects my personality. My fans probably preferred that I was a bit more understated. I had a stammer growing up, pretty much from the get-go. My brother used to finish my sentences for me, which was very frustrating. I got time off school for speech therapy, but it didn’t do me much good. Then I found out that there were singers who lost their stammers when they performed, and that tapping a rhythm on your legs helps, too. I thought: I love music – if I do this for a living, I might be able to fix it and get some confidence. I was doing an apprenticeship as a milling machinist at Vauxhall Motors with my dad when I fell in love with performing. He cajoled me into completing the apprenticeship, as any parent would, as he worried about money. He said, “I hope you’re saving some!” I was thinking: I can’t, when I make money I have to spend it on microphones and this and that and the other. I was in a few groups before I went solo: Kat Kool and the Kool Kats, Streetband, followed by the Q-Tips. We were a bit of a motley crew and stayed together for three years. Those early days were a wonderful thing: the crowds would go nuts dancing, we’d play to this big sea of people, then you’d get up in the morning and wander around and be normal again. After the band got dropped, I signed with CBS in 1982. My third single, Wherever I Lay My Hat, reached No 1 and I started selling out shows. The strategy involved in getting in and out of a gig became very technical. When I got my first security guy, I thought: Hey-hey! I’ve got a security guard. Would you believe it? By the time I realised it would be better to have one that stayed with me, and one that went on ahead, I stopped finding it so funny. Sometimes fans waited by the entrance of the venue to get autographs, so it would take an hour to get in. After the show, they would follow the tour bus back to the hotel. When I arrived I’d just be shoved in my room. I couldn’t go and have a drink with my friends in the hotel bar, so the fun started to go out of the experience a little bit. I really didn’t like being a heart-throb. I was always wary of losing my sense of identity. I was conscious that in the end you become the persona that people want you to be. I always thought: if I can’t enjoy it, then is it worth doing? After about three years of being solo, it all became too lonely, so I said to my manager, “Can we stop for a while?” I came back in the late 80s, but it was hard to ever really let loose. I always had to keep very sensible because I was doing it on my own. I used to be jealous of bands like Duran Duran because they could share the promo out. Instead I was doing the show, getting back at 1am, then up at 5am to do breakfast TV in New York. I was having no time off at all – I never even got to see America when I toured there. After the album in 1987, I felt as if I was making the wrong choices. I was trying to please the US label, and I was too influenced by other people’s opinions. I ended up taking some time out again. I just wanted to settle into my family life, with my wife and kids, and then start again from there. Get some grounding. These days I’m much more comfortable doing solo tours. People often ask, “Don’t you get bored playing?” In the 90s, I was reluctant to keep going back to those early hits, but what helped was that I started a Tex-Mex band called Los Pacaminos – it gave me a chance to do all the things I can’t really do inside my solo career. I get a guitar in my hand and take a back seat. When I have an epitaph, I want to be seen to have had an eclectic career – that I tried a lot of different styles of music, and that I quietly went about my business. I never really repeated myself from album to album. I think that’s kept me going a little bit longer than some of the other stars from that period. I like the way I look a lot better now than I did then. I know how to pose, what angles suit me better. Smiling helps as you get older. When you start to go grey, you try a few different things to stop the process. You dye your hair brown, but then the white hairs start growing back, and it looks unreal. I reached a point where I had to bite the bullet and now I don’t even mind growing a white beard. As for the jeans? I don’t think I’ll be wearing them any time soon. Faded denim doesn’t look good on a person of advancing age.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Paul Young looks back: ‘I look better now than in the 80s.

4/9/2022,"The statistics paint a straightforward picture. After only one Championship defeat all season, Liverpool have been promoted to the Women’s Super League with two games to spare. Given that Matt Beard’s side are on a 19-game unbeaten run, their record suggests an imperious procession to a title secured at Bristol City last Sunday, but the reality was slightly different. Along the way Liverpool have coped with the life-threatening car crash that left their goalkeeper Rylee Foster with her neck broken in seven places. Meanwhile, the assistant manager, Paul McHugh, suffered the death of his parents. “It’s not easy to go 19 games unbeaten in this league,” says Beard. “I’m incredibly proud of the players and the staff. This isn’t an easy league to get out of but we have a great group of people here and we’re all there for each other.” During his first stint as Liverpool’s manager, Beard led the team to the 2013 and 2014 WSL titles but after his departure to the United States in 2015 to take charge of Boston Breakers things began to unravel on Merseyside. An Anfield board fixated on Jürgen Klopp’s highly successful men’s side started cutting costs and corners when it came to the women’s squad. As managers and players came and went, complaints about poor facilities, infrastructure and substandard club housing increased. In 2020, Klopp’s side won the Premier League but Liverpool Women were relegated amid considerable unrest on the part of disgruntled senior professionals. When they finished third in the second tier last season, 11 points adrift of promoted Leicester, there was a recognition things had to change, that without significant investment Liverpool would never be able to compete with Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the WSL. Beard was tempted back to Merseyside and the club’s off-the-field game upped appreciably. Dr Francesca Champ, a performance psychologist, was hired to help hone mindsets and Russ Fraser was poached from Leicester to become the first managing director of the women’s team. Both are integral elements of the “family culture” fostered by Beard. On the pitch, the manager’s eight summer signings have made the desired impact, with the acquisition of the 22-year-old Republic of Ireland striker Leanne Kiernan from West Ham proving particularly inspired. Such changes have been applauded – loudly – by Klopp. “Liverpool in the last years was not famous for treating or dealing with women’s football outstandingly well,” he said last week. “They didn’t go down to the Championship for no reason. I’ve met a lot of the girls in the last two or three months and it’s wonderful they’re promoted. I’m really happy for the girls and Matt.” Significantly, Klopp and his players are becoming accustomed to appearing alongside their female counterparts in joint commercial and promotional campaigns. The German and Beard’s centre-half Meikayla Moore were recently filmed chatting happily together as they jointly fronted a Rainbow Laces campaign for LGBTQ+ inclusion. Rachael Laws, Beard’s first-choice goalkeeper, is delighted by the dramatic difference this season. “Things have changed tenfold,” she says. “We get treated very, very well by the men now. And Matt’s been fantastic. He’s a very good manager on the pitch but he’s even better off it, he gets the best out of you by treating you as a person.” Laws still misses having Foster challenging her for a starting place. In October the Canada youth international was on holiday in Finland with friends when the hire car they were driving towards Helsinki span out of control amid horrendous weather conditions. Foster emerged with multiple neck fractures and was pronounced lucky to be alive but is now optimistic about playing again next year. She is already sufficiently recovered to join in the celebrations planned for Sunday 24 April, when a team 14 points clear of second-placed Bristol City before the weekend’s games will collect the Championship trophy after their game against Sheffield United at Prenton Park, the home Liverpool share with the men’s League Two side Tranmere Rovers. It promises to be quite a party but, behind the scenes, preparations for next season have started with a five-year blueprint to return to the top of the English game already drafted. “First and foremost we need to consolidate ourselves in the WSL,” says Beard whose side, contentiously, remain based at Tranmere’s training ground rather than moving in alongside Klopp’s squad at their £50m base in Kirkby. “We need to be competitive. There’ll be some changes in the summer but our aim is to be sensible and progress each year.” For now, Beard’s captain, Niamh Fahey, is content to enjoy the moment. “Liverpool’s a huge club but we’ve had tough times in recent years,” she says. “To have some positivity back is a welcome change. We’re looking forward to competing at the top again.”",Sport/Football,Liverpool have to negotiate bumps on the road to Women’s Super League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/liverpool-womens-super-league-promoted-matt-beard
4/9/2022," The prolific French composer Germaine Tailleferre (1892-1983) showed her sense of rebellion early by changing her name from Taillefesse as a rebuff to her father, who objected to her musical ambitions. For too long, her work has been neglected. In Germaine Tailleferre: Her Piano Works, Revived 1 (Grand Piano) the pianist Nicolas Horvath has embarked on an invaluable project, including several world premiere recordings. Hanging out in artist circles in Montmartre in the 1920s, Tailleferre was the only female in the group of composers known as Les Six (others included Francis Poulenc and Darius Milhaud). In her comprehensive liner notes, Caroline Potter writes that Tailleferre composed at the piano, making it hard to know how many works were starting points for other music: this disc alone has 55 tracks, some gathered together in groups: Fleurs de France (1930), Suite dans le style Louis XV, and transcriptions by Monteverdi, Lully, Scarlatti and others. The Monaco-born Horvath’s versatility (check out his discography) lends itself to the chameleon Tailleferre: she switches from neoclassical to radical, tonal to bitonal, rhythmic and familiar to irregular and dissonant. Horvath is a great advocate.  Ruth Gipps (1921-99) may be remembered by the many musicians who benefited from her tutelage or played in her various orchestras, but most know little of her five symphonies, choral works or chamber music. Her centenary last year redeemed her dusty profile – a pupil of Vaughan Williams, predominantly writing in outmoded pastoral mode – with more to be done. Spearheaded by the brilliant horn player Ben Goldscheider, leading soloists and the London Chamber Orchestra have combined to produce Ruth Gipps: Winds of Change (Three Worlds) conducted by Hannah von Wiehler: chamber music featuring horn, with Huw Watkins, piano, Mary Bevan, soprano and Ruth Rosales, narrator. The 10 works, some stronger than others, reflect Gipps’s range of instrumental voices, colours and combinations, from the chirpy A Taradiddle for Two Horns, Op 54 (1959) to her last large-scale work, the Wind Sinfonietta, Op 73 (1989). Gipps is honoured by these excellent players.  Tomorrow on Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, presented by Hannah French, the European Broadcasting Union’s Holy Week Music Day opens with a live performance of Bach’s St John Passion from the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, conducted by Trevor Pinnock, 1pm.",Arts/Music,Classical home listening: Germaine Tailleferre; Ruth Gipps,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/09/germaine-tailleferre-her-piano-works-revived-1-nicolas-horvath-review-ruth-gipps-winds-of-change-ben-goldscheider-london-chamber-orchestra
4/9/2022,"In Germany, they call it “Day X”. Businesses up and down the land are making contingency plans for what is seen as a growing likelihood that Russian gas will stop flowing into Europe’s biggest economy. “It would be a disaster – one which would have seemed almost unthinkable just two months ago, but which right now feels like a very realistic prospect,” the owner of a hi-tech mechanical engineering company in western Germany said. The firm produces everything from battery cases for electric cars to train clutch systems. The speaker did not want to be named, or for his company to be identified, in part for fear, he said, of appearing to support Russia’s war by making the case that if the gas is turned off, his century-old business “will likely not survive”. But he says he is in a deep quandary and feeling very vulnerable, as he is not only heavily reliant on gas – the cost of which has already soared – but also on metals such as nickel and aluminium, much of which comes from Russia. Germany gets around 50bn cubic metres a year or 55% of its gas from Russia, the largest by volume of any EU country, and by extension, the biggest share of any large European economy. Two possible, not unlikely scenarios are being mooted: one envisages Moscow deciding to cut off or reduce supplies in retaliation for sanctions; the other sees Germany giving in to mounting pressure to support an EU energy embargo according to which the recipients would effectively call Putin’s bluff by cutting themselves off from Russian supplies. On Friday at the Brandenburg Gate, protesters in favour of an oil and gas embargo made their point for the moral argument, with 410 red lights commemorating the victims of Russian army killings in the town of Bucha, alongside slogans asking German chancellor Olaf Scholz: “If not now, when?” Their message is stark. As long as German industry keeps taking the energy – for which it pays Moscow €200m (£167m) every day – it is helping fund the atrocities. But industry bosses and political leaders have warned that the damage to Germany by turning off the taps would be far greater than any benefit it brings to Ukraine. “What use to anybody is a weakened Germany?” a source close to the government told the Guardian this week. Millions of private homes without heat is just one part of the picture. The other, arguably bigger concern, are the manufacturing giants, dependent on gas to operate, such as Thyssenkrupp, BASF and Bayer. And the hundreds of thousands of small and medium sized businesses with which they are interlinked. Industry representatives have warned that the effects would be felt in every product from construction material, synthetics, pesticides, disinfectant, packaging and semiconductors to the production of antibiotics, Coronavirus vaccines and cancer drugs. The chain reaction is difficult to predict but likely to be considerable. Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has urged Germans to “turn down the thermostat” – saying that “every kilowatt hour that Germany saves harms Putin” – what some have cynically dubbed “freezing for Ukraine”. Industry too is being urged to scale back its use. Some have done so already, forced by the high energy costs. Others, such as the porcelain manufacturer KPM, founded in 1763, are working overtime to produce as many goods as possible before the taps are turned off. “Who knows for how long we will have gas?” its CEO, Martina Hacker, told Der Spiegel. “We can’t produce porcelain without it.” Other companies have reduced production to a minimum. But industries such as glass manufacturers say shutting down production facilities altogether is not an option as it would cause liquids to set and destroy the machines. The country’s 45 gas storage facilities are only about 26% full. The plan is to increase levels to 80% by the autumn, largely by saving energy now, in order to safeguard supplies for next winter. Habeck triggered the first part of a three-point emergency plan last week that anticipates a slow-down or halt of gas and decides where supplies would go. Hospitals, emergency services and medical manufacturers would be prioritised, followed by private households. Industries, which use a quarter of the gas delivered to Germany would be the first expected to shut down, according to the plan. Which is why businesses are being asked to put forward their arguments as to how “system relevant” they are. Law firms have been flooded with queries from companies wanting to know their legal standing, while industrial associations report being inundated with queries by members asking where they rank in the pecking order and how they should react to the uncertainty. One representative said: “We have glass manufacturers saying they are system relevant because they provide the medical industry with glass vials, paper manufacturers, arguing that their corrugated cardboard is vital for the safe transport of the vials. How do you possibly argue against them?” The Federal Network Agency, which ensures fair access to gas, electricity and other vital services, has sent a questionnaire to all German businesses, asking them to effectively set out their individual arguments for a right to gas. “The question of prioritisation is a very difficult decision, requiring consideration of a wide range of consequences,” said a spokesperson for the economics ministry. Some predict an ugly battle over who deserves the energy most. There are doomsday visions of supply chains – already under pressure due to the pandemic – collapsing altogether, businesses forced into bankruptcy, mass unemployment. The head of IG Metall, Jörg Hoffmann, a unionthat represents 1.2 million workers in the chemical, metal processing and food production, has warned of “a recession deeper than any of the recessions we have known until now.” BASF, the chemical giant, and one of Germany’s biggest single purchasers and consumers of energy, said the effect of its production downturn would soon be felt. “We would get very high unemployment, many firms would go bust,” BASF chairman Martin Brudermüller has said. “It would lead to irreversible damage. To put it bluntly: it could lead Germany into its most serious crisis since the end of the second world war, and destroy our prosperity.” A race against time is on to find alternative gas source supplies from the Netherlands and Norway and increaseliquid natural gas (LNG) supplies from Belgian terminals and the US. Habeck has been to Qatar to secure further shipments and has ordered the construction of LNG carriers to float in German ports rather than wait for the construction of proposed new LNG terminals, which will take too long. The abolition of coal-fired plants – seen as a central part of the climate emergency plan – may yet be delayed. The pressure is on to scale up and speed up renewable projects in wind and solar. Companies such as the pharmacy giant Merck are making their own plans to build wind turbines and solar energy panels to increase their independence – if only to be able to heat their offices. But it is a gargantuan effort that will probably take years and in the meantime Germany is left looking extremely vulnerable. Some companies are even contemplating moving their production facilities abroad, predicting that operating in Germany will become prohibitively expensive and triggering fears Europe’s economic motor is in danger of losing its competitive edge. While Habeck believes Germany is in a position to wean itself off Russian gas in around two years’ time, Brudermüller believes four to five years is more realistic. Some experts say by the end of the decade is more likely.",News/World news,‘Firms will go bust’: Germany prepares for a future without Russian gas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/firms-will-go-bust-germany-prepares-for-a-future-without-russian-gas
