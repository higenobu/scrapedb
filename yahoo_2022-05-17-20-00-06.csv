5/17/2022,"Loved ones gathered at the graveside services for Vicky White, the woman who died by suicide in a tragic conclusion to a nationwide manhunt. The 56-year-old was laid to rest on Saturday at the Center Hill Cemetery in Alabama, just miles from where she allegedly helped charged murderer Casey White escape the Lauderdale County Jail on April 29, according to the NY Post. Casey White's escape set off a massive search that ended with a car crash on May 9 in Evansville, Indiana in which Casey White was capture and the former assistant director of corrections was found with a gun in her hand and a reportedly self-inflicted gunshot wound. Vicky White succumbed to her injuries after being transported to Deaconess Hospital. Vicky White’s obituary gave little details about her life, other than she came from Lexington, Alabama and worked at the jail from which Casey White went missing. Many took to the obituary’s online tribute wall to pay their condolences to Vicky White, who had once been regarded as a model employee after 16 years at the detention center. “You were an amazing woman; it was an honor to work with you for all these many years,” wrote one woman. “You are now with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And when our Savior sees it fit and the time is right, you will be back in the loving arms of your beloved Casey once again.” Authorities say Vicky White had a romantic relationship with Casey White, who was awaiting trial for the 2015 murder of Connie Ridgeway. Alabama law classifies sexual contact with an inmate by an employee as custodial sexual misconduct, a class C felony. On April 29, Vicky White — who was working on her last day at the jail before her retirement — told coworkers she was taking the inmate for a mental health evaluation before the two vanished. There was reportedly no such appointment for Casey White. U.S. Marshals received a tip 10 days later that the pair were spotted exiting a vehicle at an Indiana car wash, as captured on surveillance photos published by ABC affiliate WAAY-TV. According to a GoFundMe page created by local Alabama radio host Mark White, the man who called in the tip leading to the dramatic conclusion of the manhunt is car wash owner James Stinson. Mark White — a family friend who has long-advocated justice for murder victim Connie Ridgeway — created the GoFundMe page with Ridgeway’s family to raise money for a reward for James Stinson. He was one of many who expressed sadness over Vicky White's passing. “From day one, we have sought justice and will continue to do so,” Mark White told Oxygen.com. “Life is so precious and has value. Connie’s life mattered, and Vicky’s life mattered too.” Casey White was serving a 75-year sentence following a 2015 crime spree that included a home invasion, two carjackings and multiple shootings that left a dog dead and one woman injured, as previously reported. He was eventually also charged with stabbing Ridgeway to death in her Rogersville, Alabama apartment in 2015, a case which had gone unsolved for five years until Casey White allegedly confessed in a letter to investigators. He later pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease and was being held at the Lauderdale County Jail awaiting trial before he escaped. Ridgeway’s family was shocked by the escape but happy that Casey White was captured. “It’s so refreshing to have a chance at justice again,” Ridgeway’s son, Austin Williams, told Oxygen.com. “We thought it was gone just a week ago. We didn’t think it would end well, and since then, we found out it was planned to end in a shootout. So we were very fortunate. It feels like a miracle.” Despite Casey being back in custody, Ridgeway’s family also felt the sadness of Vicky White's death. “We hoped and prayed for the best possible outcome, and this wasn’t it,” Williams continued. “We’re very sorry for the loss of Vicky. Our hearts go out to her family and friends. She was a beloved member of the community.” Vicky White’s final moments were captured in a chaotic 911 call, as previously reported, and dashcam footage published by AL.com showed authorities placing Casey White under arrest and pulling Vicky White’s lifeless body from the wreckage of the overturned car. Vicky White still had a gun in her hand. Casey White was treated for injuries resulting from the car crash, according to Fox affiliate WBRC, and extradited back to Alabama on Tuesday. Lauderdale Sheriff Rick Singleton said Casey White “seemed blank. No emotion. No remorse. Nothing,” AL.com reported. In addition to the capital murder charges he still faces in Ridgeway’s death, he is also now facing charges of escape in the first degree, according to CNN. The trial for Ridgeway’s murder is scheduled for June.",U.S./Oxygen,"Funeral Services Held In Alabama For Former Jailor Vicky White, Murder Victim's Loved Ones Express Condolences",https://news.yahoo.com/funeral-services-held-alabama-former-200709988.html
5/17/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - One military analyst had a brutally frank message for viewers of Russian state television: The war in Ukraine will get much worse for Russia, which is facing a mass mobilisation supported by the United States while Russia is almost totally isolated. Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Russia state media - and especially state television - have supported the Kremlin's position. Few dissenting voices have been given air time. That appeared to have changed on Monday night when one well-known military analyst gave a blunt assessment to Russia's main state television channel of what Putin casts as the ""special military operation"". ""You should not swallow informational tranquilizers,"" Mikhail Khodaryonok, a retired colonel, told the ""60 Minutes"" talk show on Rossiya-1 hosted by Olga Skabeyeva, one of the most pro-Kremlin journalists on television. ""The situation, frankly speaking, will get worse for us,"" said Khodaryonok, a regular guest on state TV who gives often candid assessments of the situation. He said that Ukraine could mobilise 1 armed million men. Khodaryonok, a military columnist for the gazeta.ru newspaper and a graduate of one of Russia's elite military academies, cautioned before the invasion that such a step would not be in Russia's national interests. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, displaced millions more and raised fears of the most serious confrontation between Russia and the United States since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Khodaryonok and Skabeyeva could not be reached for comment. SENSE OF REALISM The war has also shown the post-Soviet limits of Russia's military, intelligence and economic power: despite Putin's attempts to bolster his armed forces, the Russian military has fared badly in many battles in Ukraine. An encirclement of Kyiv was abandoned and Russia has turned its focus instead towards trying to establish control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. The West has supplied billions of dollars of arms to Ukrainian forces. Losses are not publicly reported but Ukraine says Russian losses are worse than the 15,000 Soviets killed in the Soviet-Afghan war of 1979-1989. ""The desire to defend one's motherland in the sense that it exists in Ukraine - it really does exist there and they intend to fight to the last,"" Khodaryonok said before he was interrupted by Skabeyeva. The biggest strategic consequences of Russia's invasion to date have been the unusual unity of the United States' European allies and bids by Sweden and Finland to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. Khodaryonok said Russia needed to see the reality. ""The main thing in our business is have a sense of military-political realism: if you go beyond that then the reality of history will hit you so hard that you will not know what hit you,"" he said. ""Don't wave rockets in the direction of Finland for goodness sake - it just looks rather funny,"" he said. Russia, he said, was isolated. ""The main deficiency of our military-political position is that we are in full geopolitical solitude and - however we don't want to admit it - practically the whole world is against us - and we need to get out of this situation.""
