There were doors down there, but I’d just locked them all up and no one was around. I was so creeped out, I locked the doors connecting the wing to the rest of the school and ran to my car. I always felt like I was seeing things out of the corner of my eye working there at night, but that was the most visible, for sure thing I saw at that place."" —u/UcallmeNightHawk —u/Apart_Future9033 —u/HonestTangerine2 —u/No_Organization_6343 —u/rasurec —u/guitarfreek85 —u/MissMurderpants —u/ok_koreal ""At 11 p.m. I was doing paperwork with an eye on the CCTV when a tall man in all black came across the monitor. He was very tall but had his head down. I asked him what he needed — and he told me he was convinced he wasn’t safe and needed to go to an inpatient psych ward to escape the people who were after him."" The next two hours I was on the phone trying to find out if anywhere would take him, but there were no beds, he was coherent, and he basically didn’t pose enough of an urgent situation to warrant being sectioned. He saw it as the hospital not caring about his suffering and not believing he was genuinely ill; he hinted that I was colluding with them to get him killed."" —u/itsabloodydisgrace —u/Corey307 ""I stood at the entrance to the bathroom and yelled in to ask them what cell they were in so I could add an extra body to that cell for my count but got no answer. I then walked into the bathroom and searched everywhere but found absolutely nobody. I told one of my co-workers about what happened, and the first thing they asked me was, 'Was he tall and skinny with long dreads?' And he had been! When I answered, 'Yes,' I was told, 'That's Mr. Bones. He killed himself a few years ago, but he still hangs around.' I still get goosebumps thinking about it."" —u/PsychedelicGoat42 ""I climbed down the ladder into the tunnels. All the contractor lights were off. I said, 'Hello, anyone here?' a few times and shined my flashlight around — silence for a moment. Then I hear what sounds like a radio tune from the 1920s coming from the tunnel. I immediately climbed the ladder, padlocked the trap door, armed the motion sensors, and left."" —u/TimothyDextersGhost —u/Electronic-End3310 ""We were all very afraid but were hoping it was a prank call since sometimes kids would prank call. I looked out in our lobby, and there was a tall man, wearing a blue collared shirt tucked in, standing at the door, and facing the other way. We were terrified. We called the cops, and we saw the cops speak to him. They had asked him to leave. We never saw that man again."" —u/angeles41 ""We walked past this door that led to an outside deck that is locked and rarely used and offers no access to outside people (remember, we were on the fourth floor). As my co-worker and I walked by, we heard a loud and distinct knock coming from the outside. We stopped and looked at each other, and it knocked again. Because the door was locked and armed, we couldn't open it. We ran outside and told security, who then said they would go and check it. Then he said, 'This happens every night, knocks on the fourth floor; we look, but no one is ever there.'"" —u/Thornbelina —u/eugenessocks —u/Kool_Kid16 ""We had euthanized a large golden that same night, and the dog was running toward the room that has the freezer in it. It happened again the next night. Oddly enough, the next night the owners called back and asked for more paw prints, and they wanted the collar they had forgotten to take off. I’m convinced the dog was sticking around for them."" —u/Spoopyseason6 ""At about 3 a.m. we heard a blood-curdling female scream from one of the other aisles. I immediately thought something happened to the other supervisor, but when I turned around, she was in the same aisle as me. We ran to where the sound came from but did not find anyone in the store. We asked the guys in the back room if they heard something, and they were relieved as they heard it a few times a week and thought they were going crazy. The next day we even had security look at the cameras, and there was definitely nobody else in the store."" —u/Gnonkage —u/Wit-Hoid6674 —u/Kaladrax182 —u/NHorn98 —u/Byahero95 ""We kept doing our duties until about 10–15 minutes later, when we heard scratching coming from the same exact room. Noah and I were freaked out; at this point we were basically done with cleaning and vacuuming, and we sprinted out the front door. The next day it turns out that the vents were being twitchy (scratching), and the loud bang remained unknown. These events kept happening for three days, and no one ever gave me any clues for the loud banging."" —u/Odd-Tension-2133 —u/santichrist —u/BaronVonBadAsh —u/Chattman2",U.S./BuzzFeed,"People Who Work Graveyard Shifts Are Sharing Their Unsettling On-The-Job Stories, And I'm Not Going To Lie — I'm Scared Y'all",https://news.yahoo.com/night-shift-workers-sharing-creepiest-074602179.html
