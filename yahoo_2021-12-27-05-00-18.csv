12/27/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- With Didi Global Inc. seeking a listing in Hong Kong less than a year after its tumultuous debut in New York, investors are looking for other U.S.-traded Chinese names that could potentially offer shares closer to home amid regulatory pressures.

Listing in Hong Kong is seen as an alternative for firms wanting to retain access to global investors while being more palatable to Beijing. It is also simpler and quicker than a mainland deal. The regulatory threats mean companies with a total market cap of almost $200 billion currently listed only in the U.S. may need to seek a return to Hong Kong or the mainland soon, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Matthew Kanterman and Tiffany Tam wrote in a note. A list compiled by Bloomberg News includes Pinduoduo Inc. and Nio Inc. among the largest names. China to Tighten Foreign IPOs; May Ban Some on National Security Didi could file with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange around March, people with knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg News. It is poised to join over a dozen Chinese firms that have already completed second listings in the city after making global debuts through American depositary receipts, including JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. “Many of the big mutual funds are in the process of or have converted the majority of their ADR exposure into Hong Kong shares for stocks which are currently dual listed, suggesting a natural migration to Hong Kong is taking place,” said Alex Abagian, co-head of Asia Pacific equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley. Below are the U.S.-traded companies that could come up with homecoming listings: Pinduoduo The e-commerce operator is the biggest Chinese company by market capitalization listed only in the U.S. Founded by Colin Huang, it has been one of the few major internet giants to escape a direct hit from Beijing’s wide-ranging tech crackdown. The firm’s ADRs rose to a record high in New York in February, but have slumped about 70% since amid a selloff in Chinese shares globally. Nio The electric-vehicle maker could be set to follow peers XPeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc., which launched second primary listings in Hong Kong this year. Nio this month unveiled its second sedan, which will compete more directly with Tesla Inc.’s most popular Model 3. Its ADRs are down about 50% from their February all-time high. KE Holdings Inc. The Beijing-based online housing platform was a target of short-seller Muddy Waters Research this month. KE said the report is “without merit” and that it has authorized an internal review of Muddy Waters’ key allegations. The impact has been minimal on the ADRs, which were already down more than 70% from a record high in February. Kanzhun Ltd. The Beijing-based owner of online recruitment platform Boss Zhipin surged in its U.S. debut in June, and has managed to trade well above listing price since then despite the volatility that has dominated Chinese names. Its ADRs are up 73% since listing. (Market cap $13.5 billion) Tencent Music Entertainment Group The music entertainment company, a rival to NetEase Inc.’s Cloud Village Inc., debuted in New York over three years ago. The firm is well-positioned to capture a piece of the burgeoning $800 billion metaverse market through its virtual concert business, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Its ADRs have fallen 80% from a March peak to about half of their 2018 IPO price. (Market cap $11 billion) Futu Holdings Ltd. The Chinese online brokerage is planning to file for a Hong Kong listing that could raise about $1 billion, IFR reported in October. Its ADRs have fallen nearly 80% from a February record high though they’re still trading at about three times their March 2019 IPO price. (Market cap $6 billion) IQiyi Inc. The video-entertainment service operator has slumped over 80% since late March, hit by fears that Chinese tech giants would be kicked off U.S. bourses. The Baidu Inc. subsidiary was said to have picked banks for a Hong Kong second listing, according to a Bloomberg News report in October.

12/27/2021,"One of the biggest trends in the cryptocurrency market this year is the metaverse. The metaverse didn’t gain much attention earlier this year but burst into the scene in the second half of 2021 as investors took advantage of the change in dynamics. While most of the attention in the market goes to the biggest coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, they are usually outperformed by some smaller coins. SAND, the native token of The Sandbox platform, and MANA, Decentraland’s native token, are some of the best performers in 2021. Start Trading Crypto now with eToro MANA and SAND have added thousands of percentages to their values since the start of the year, and they are now amongst the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Their adoption didn’t kick-off at the start of the year, but they grabbed attention towards the end of 2021. Perhaps the major catalyst behind MANA and SAND’s rally is social media giant Facebook’s rebranding to Meta, indicating that it will expand its portfolio to enter the metaverse space. The move prompted massive adoption of metaverse-focused tokens such as SAND, MANA and several others. From the start of the year, MANA was trading below the $1 mark, briefly climbing above that threshold in May. However, the coin rallied in October following Facebook’s announcement, rising to its all-time high above $5 within a few weeks. Over the past 52 weeks, MANA’s price is up by more than 4,000%, outperforming numerous coins in the process. In November, Tokens.com, a Canadian investment firm that focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi), purchased virtual real estate on the Decentraland platform for roughly $2.5 million. The sale was one of the biggest in the history of the metaverse space. Popular gaming hardware company GameStop also announced earlier this month that it would start accepting MANA, SAND and a few other cryptocurrencies as means of payment for its products. SAND is not left behind in terms of adoption. The token’s price has surged by thousands of percentages since the start of the year and is now one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. SAND has benefited immensely from Facebook’s entry into the metaverse space, with its price up by more than 900% since the announcement. German sports apparel manufacturer Adidas announced its partnership with The Sandbox last month as it became the latest corporate entity to venture into the metaverse space. Also, in November, The Sandbox launched its Metaverse Alpha, an open multi-week Play-to-Earn event where players would have the opportunity to explore The Sandbox Metaverse. Another huge development that saw SAND rally towards the end of the year was the adoption by PwC. PwC Hong Kong, a subsidiary of Pricewaterhouse Coopers, announced a few days ago that it had purchased land in The Sandbox metaverse. PwC Hong Kong intends to construct a Web 3.0 advisory hub in the metaverse, which will provide numerous professional services that include accounting and taxation. Heading into 2022, SAND is trading close to the $7 mark, outperforming numerous coins over the past 12 months. The metaverse sector is in its early days, and many experts believe that 2022 holds even higher potential for projects in this area. LinkedIn CEO and co-founder Reid Hoffman recently told CNBC that there would be massive investment and development in the metaverse space over the coming years. According to Hoffman, the metaverse space has been around for a while, stating that the internet is an early version of the metaverse. The adoption of metaverse projects is expected to grow further in the coming year. According to analysts at investment bank Morgan Stanley, the metaverse could become an $8 trillion market if it can host the next generation of social media, streaming and gaming platforms. SAND and MANA are two of the leading metaverse projects with a shared market cap of under $30 billion. If the metaverse market grows at the projected rate, then MANA and SAND could record further growth in the coming months and years. SAND’s technical indicators show that the coin is one of the best performers in the cryptocurrency market at the market. SAND is trading above its 200-day moving average of $1.76, while the MACD line is above the neutral zone. The RSI of 71 shows that SAND is currently heading into the oversold region. At press time, SAND is trading above the $6 level. Analysts at WalletInvestor predict that SAND’s price could double in 2022 and reach the $13 mark before the end of next year. MANA’s technical indicators show that the coin is also performing well. The coin is trading above its 200-day moving average of $1.59, while the MACD line is around the neutral zone. The RSI of 52 also shows that it is in the neutral zone at the moment. At press time, MANA is trading around $3.7 per coin. The token’s price could rally by nearly 140% in 2022 as WalletInvestor analysts predict that MANA could trade around $8 by the end of next year. The metaverse space is one of the most exciting areas in the cryptocurrency space, and more investors will be keeping an eye on it in the coming year.
