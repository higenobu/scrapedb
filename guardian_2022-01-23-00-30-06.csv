1/23/2022,"On a freezing day in Bath, Leinster delivered with ice-cool precision to secure a bonus-point victory before half-time. Jimmy O’Brien scored four of their 10 tries as the Irish province boosted their hopes of a favourable draw in the knockout stages of the Champions Cup. If there was a positive for the hosts, they displayed no lack or spirit or effort, but were hopelessly outclassed by a Leinster outfit crammed with international quality. The Bath coach, Neal Hatley, had likened the Leinster fly-half Jonathan Sexton to Yoda before kick-off, with England’s new recruit Orlando Bailey in the role of Luke Skywalker: a box-office duel between opposing No 10s at very different stages of their careers. It was a catchy line but there could be no question, by the end, which player had demonstrated true mastery of their art. Sexton was sublime as he so often is: passing and kicking with relentless accuracy and variation, unleashing Leinster’s glittering array of attacking talent, leaving Bath bereft. The Premiership side were too often undermined by a misfiring set piece.  Before last week’s 13-try demolition of Montpellier, Leinster had not played for five weeks due to Covid-19-related disruption, and if the head coach Stuart Lancaster wished to see his defence properly tested, he got his wish in the first 10 minutes. Bath tore into the contest and Jacques du Toit’s powerful run from close range, after Bath had won a penalty from the kick-off, asked an early question. But the visitors held firm and once Leinster repelled an initial spell of pressure it was one-way traffic. Leinster appeared to have taken the lead when O’Brien dotted down following Sexton’s polished grubber kick. But after a lengthy TMO review, Jordan Larmour was correctly adjudged to have pulled back Bath’s Max Clark. A deafening mixture of laughter and disbelief from the home support, watching replays on the big screen, appeared to prompt a rethink from Italian referee Andrea Piardi. It remained scoreless after 15 minutes and things were starting to warm up when Bath’s Sam Underhill took a bang to the head and was taken off. The hosts had also lost the No 8 Josh Bayliss to injury a minute before, prompting an early restructure in the back row. With Underhill out of action it did not take for Leinster to cross the try line. After strong work by the British & Irish Lions back row Jack Conan, Leinster span the ball left and a clinical pass by Hugo Keenan allowed O’Brien to touch down for the opening score. Josh van der Flier’s athletic sprint, running a superb line on to a Robbie Henshaw pass, brought the second try. The prompting of Sexton was causing endless problems for Bath’s overworked defenders. Another stunning piece of timing and precision sent Larmour racing to the line for try number three. It was 19-0 in double-quick time and beginning to look like a long afternoon for Bath. But a fine steal and galloping run by Charlie Ewels, followed by a composed offload to Clark, brought a try for Bath and a rousing cheer from the home support. No panic from Leinster. Henshaw was soon crashing into space from the right wing and another laser-guided grubber by Sexton popped up perfectly for O’Brien to finish. Bonus point sealed. Ciaran Frawley bashed over before the break for the fifth try and a score of 33-7. Bath’s Gabriel Hamer-Webb was sin-binned five minutes after half-time for a deliberate knock-on and Andrew Porter was soon pushed over the line, the sixth try making it 40-7. Sexton’s perceptive cross-kick to the corner, switching the point of attack completely, allowed O’Brien the space to score his hat-trick. Another fluent wave of passing prompted by Sexton’s chip kick into space saw Keenan crash over. Max Deegan was sin-binned for an off-the-ball hit on the Bath scrum-half Ben Spencer, on a rare foray into the Leinster 22, but at 14-a-side, the hosts could still not trouble the scorers. Dan Sheehan romped over the line for Leinster’s latest score with 10 minutes left, latching on to Jamison Gibson-Park’s pass, and O’Brien raced on to a kick from deep to add his fourth, and Leinster’s 10th try, of another sobering afternoon for Bath.",Sport/Sport,Jimmy O’Brien scores four as ruthless Leinster run 10 tries past Bath,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/22/bath-leinster-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
1/23/2022,"Charities supporting the UK’s most vulnerable patients have pleaded with the public to keep wearing masks even after most Covid restrictions end in England this week. Transplant patients and those with illnesses such as blood cancer and late-stage kidney disease “feel abandoned” by the government, charities said, after Boris Johnson announced that plan B measures will end on Wednesday.  People will no longer be required to wear masks on public transport and in shops, or use vaccine certificates, and the government has stopped asking people to work from home. By 24 March, the legal requirement for people with Covid to self-isolate will end, and the prime minister told MPs the date may be brought forward. Although official guidance is to “suggest” that individuals wear masks in crowded and enclosed spaces with people they do not normally meet, Kidney Care UK and Blood Cancer UK said that ministers were not telling the public this. Kidney Care UK’s policy director, Fiona Loud, said: “We want to say thank you to everyone who does recognise that the pandemic still isn’t over for thousands of kidney patients who are still vulnerable to Covid-19. Whether it’s employers considering more flexible working or people continuing to wear masks when they are no longer mandated: thank you.” She said people with kidney disease were “understandably anxious that Covid-19 protections are being phased out”. Many had been shielding since March 2020, Loud said. “Quite simply, they feel abandoned, having already spent two years under Covid-19 stress.” Helen Rowntree, director of research, services and engagement for Blood Cancer UK, said the needs of immunocompromised people “have not been mentioned at all” by ministers who are justifying the decision. “The government should be talking about the fact that immunocompromised people are still vulnerable to Covid and explaining this to the public,” she said. “At the moment, it is falling to charities like us to make the case to the public to continue mask-wearing and respecting people’s distance in public places, because there is no way of knowing if the person behind you in the queue is immunocompromised. “The more people who wear masks and keep their distance in crowded places, the more that immunocompromised people will be able to live normal lives. We welcome the fact in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, people are still being required to wear masks in shops and other indoor public places.” She praised the government’s decision to give many people with blood cancer access to treatments such as sotrovimab, a neutralising monoclonal antibody, and molnupiravir, an antiviral. “But it needs to make sure everyone eligible is able to access these treatments,” she added. Transport for London data shows that on 26 November the number of bus journeys had risen above 5m a day for the first time since the pandemic began – about 80% of pre-pandemic levels. Omicron sent numbers falling over Christmas, but they had returned to 4.5m a day by 14 January. However, research by University College London’s Covid Social Study group showed that after restrictions ended on “Freedom Day” last July, there was not an immediate effect on public compliance with government guidelines, and more than 80% of people say they comply most of the time, with about one in three complying all the time. Professor Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist at the University of St Andrews, said that most people wore masks and took precautions out of concern for others. Although most people stick to the guidelines, he said the government’s actions “now send a message that ‘infections don’t matter’ and there is a broad literature showing that if people are told or believe there is no risk, they won’t act to mitigate that risk. “The government talk endlessly about dropping restrictions as if by doing nothing they do us a favour,” he said. “But what they are doing is refusing to protect us, for example by improving ventilation in schools and elsewhere, and refusing to support us to self-isolate. The rhetoric of ‘lockdown’ and of ‘freedom’ is a rhetoric that covers a laissez-faire refusal to do anything – and we shouldn’t buy into it.” Many headteachers have said they intend to continue to ask pupils to wear masks, because soaring levels of absences of staff and students had caused serious disruption to lessons. About 100,000 children are no longer on a school roll since the pandemic began. Some parents who are more at risk of serious illness from Covid have turned to home schooling to protect their health. The Resolution Foundation reported in November that about 600,000 people had opted out of work because of fear of the virus and long Covid. Rosie Weatherley, information content manager at Mind, the mental health charity, said although some people would feel hopeful about the end of restrictions, some would not. “There are a lot of different emotions we could be feeling right now – anxiety around health, future restrictions, crowds and socialising, pressures to return to a busy working environment and changes to daily routines,” she said. “It’s important to remember that there is no ‘normal’ response to changes to restrictions or the pandemic. Feelings can change daily and may be affected by lots of things that are outside of our control. It’s important that everyone – including the UK government and employers – recognises this. Some of us will need longer to adjust to the changes than others, and many of us will continue to need help and support for their mental health beyond lockdown lifting.”",News/World news,"Keep wearing masks, charities urge as Covid measures are lifted in England",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/keep-wearing-masks-charities-urge-as-covid-measures-are-lifted-in-england
1/23/2022,"Two weeks ago, as 2021 turned into 2022, my inbox was suddenly full of couples requesting counselling. It wasn’t that surprising because every year after Christmas, many couples have a meltdown. It’s the fatal combination of forced Christmas jollity and endless hours spent together that makes people realise they don’t know if they like or get on with each other any more. Throw in the confinement of Covid and you have perfect conditions for relationship breakdown. So couples contact me. The journey starts as we delve beneath the veneer of the couple, going to places that most fear to go. Top of the problem agenda is usually sex, followed by money. But, at the heart of all this, is the desire for true intimacy combined with our deep fear of it.  Couples counselling is not easy work. With individual therapy there is one person sitting opposite me, but in couples therapy there are three of us, making the room a much busier place. Emotions fly around, exploding and then landing like small hand grenades. In my years as a couples counsellor, I have encountered pretty much everything – the man who secretly loved dressing up when his wife was out, until she discovered him in her bra and knickers; the woman with two lovers in two different continents; the decades-married husband who turned from an international diplomat to ecowarrior leaving his wife confused and bewildered, and trying to persuade him not to move the family to a yurt. One man even came in brandishing a gun (unloaded) saying he would shoot himself if his girlfriend wouldn’t let him come home. But for most couples, what happens in therapy stays in the room. It remains a mystery to anyone outside the consultation room – and sometimes it’s pretty mysterious even to those inside. But now, we have Couples Therapy, a BBC Two programme that lifts the lid on this difficult and subtle process by showing psychologist Dr Orla Guralnik in session with couples. We see DeSean and Elaine (she shouts, he’s fed up), Mau and Annie (he wants more sex, she doesn’t) – and so on. Everything is here – drama, pathos, anguish, fun, shouting, weeping, making up, falling out. The programme is, of course, compulsive viewing even though it’s obviously staged and the couples are most likely chosen because they are able to be eloquent, controversial, in-your-face and vulnerable. This is not what couples counselling is usually like. Couples come into my room and then there are silences, repetitions, action and inaction. I have sat in on couples sessions when I was training, and at times it was like watching paint dry. The process can be painstakingly slow as couples struggle to articulate their feelings. Yet Couples Therapy showcases couples (in the USA which, I think, makes it a fundamentally different experience) who seem happy to go on camera and open up about their intimate relationships – nothing is off limits. They tell each other off, talk over each other, refuse to speak, get angry. It’s dramatic at times. This is not how I work with my couples – I encourage people to talk from the “I” position and to cut out naming, blaming and shaming. I don’t let my couples take cheap shots at each other. I also try to get them to recognise and change the “you did this” “well you did that” style of relating. Playground communication doesn’t get anyone anywhere. Yet what makes the show so fascinating is that it does give us an insight in to how couples operate. Part of us is probably transfixed at the revelations of sex – or lack of it. Part of us is keen to take away some knowledge from the show. If Gurlanick can get couples to open up and then give them some insights and advice on their relationship, maybe we can all take something from that. Most people probably cannot afford the fee of a top therapist such as Gurlanick. There’s also a healthy dose of voyeurism. We watch relationships unravel and, inside, many of us might think, “well, at least we’re not as bad as them.” And the cynical part of us is probably aware that those who participate in the show might have some motive for being on TV other than receiving the therapy. But, although this is an American programme, we Britons are now far more open to having therapy than ever before. Every generation is coming to the couch. I have clients in their 70s and those who are teenagers. The ability to communicate is not correlated with age. Some teenagers are highly emotionally intelligent and able to share their feelings, others take a bit more time. But there is a generational divide when it comes to couples. I find the under-40s see me before they have even got near a crisis point. They come, they say, because they value their mental health much in the same way that they value their physical health. They often come because they want to acquire communication tools, to head off conflict before it derails them. They are open to each other and genuinely curious. Older couples seem to find this playful curiosity more difficult. I have met long-term married couples who seem to know very little about each other. When I once asked a man what he thought his wife’s sexual fantasies might be (they were struggling with their intimate connection), he looked utterly affronted. “I’d never dream of asking her that,” he said. “It would be very rude and intrusive.” Yet I find most couples have an “energy” about them. Some say they never row (which, in my book, is not necessarily a good thing) and that their relationship needs “tweaking”. As sessions go on they turn out to be utterly terrified of opening up to each other. Others come in shouting and screaming but end up entwined on the sofa whispering and giggling like teenagers. For me it’s endlessly fascinating. It’s not the work I expected to do – couples counselling is not for the fainthearted. But it’s as compulsive, as difficult, as enjoyable and rewarding as it appears to be on the television.",News/Society,I’ve seen everything as a counsellor.

1/23/2022,"Singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Mark Oliver Everett, 58, is the frontman of alternative rock band Eels and is also known by the stage name E. Since 1996, Eels have released 13 studio albums including the acclaimed Beautiful Freak, Electro-Shock Blues and Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. Eels won best international breakthrough act at the 1998 Brit awards, while a 2007 BBC documentary about Everett and his father, physicist Hugh Everett III, won a Royal Television Society award. He lives in Los Angeles. The new Eels album, Extreme Witchcraft, will be released on 28 January and they tour the UK from March.  Glamour Ghoul: The Passions and Pain of the Real Vampira, Maila Nurmi by Sandra Nurmi I really like biographies, because I’m interested in the possibilities of human life and what people have been through. I stumbled upon this book about the first American TV horror host, Vampira – she was portrayed in the Tim Burton film Ed Wood. It was written by her niece and it’s fascinating and full of jaw-dropping moments. For example, she ends up getting pregnant with Orson Welles’s child, but never tells him and gives the child up for adoption. The child had no idea his father was Welles until Vampira’s niece contacted him as a 50- or 60-year-old. Get Back (Disney+) I was very sceptical about this, from all the hype around it – I am an extreme Beatles nerd. There is nothing I know more about than the Beatles and I just thought this was going to be a glossing over of history. I’m happy to say that Peter Jackson proved me completely wrong – it’s incredible. I don’t know how no one else thought to do this for 50 years. It was really interesting to me just how sweet and agreeable John Lennon was through the whole thing. And, of course, when Ringo admits to farting, that’s a highlight. Coco (Pixar, 2017) One of the great things about the Get Back documentary was, as a father of a four-year-old, I was excited that there was finally something on Disney+ for Dad to watch. One of the other things I discovered there was the movie Coco, which I was late coming to. I’ve now seen it probably 100 times with my son and I’m still not sick of it. It’s particularly in my wheelhouse because it’s about life and death and manages to connect the two in a beautiful, really moving way. I honestly think it’s one of the best movies ever made. Brittany Howard NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert I was aware of Brittany Howard’s music and I liked her songs that I’d heard. And then I stumbled upon her Tiny Desk Concert and it’s stunning. It’s as good as music gets, in my book. You’ve got to watch this and listen to the first song, Stay High – it’s an amazing, spine-tingling performance. It’s got that unspeakable magic: it’s gospel-like, super soulful and what it’s saying is a beautiful sentiment, said in a way that no one’s really said before. The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Cartoonist by Adrian Tomine Graphic novels were a huge influence on me in the early days of the Eels. This is a really beautiful autobiographical book and it’s simultaneously really funny and cringeworthy because Tomine depicts a lot of embarrassing stories about himself. He’s very open and honest, and it also has some really moving parts and will probably make you cry at some point. My favourite genre: funny and heartbreaking. He’s really great at being completely honest about being an artist, to having some renown and navigating people knowing who he is or not knowing him. The Girl from Chickasaw County: The Complete Capitol Masters by Bobbie Gentry Bobbie Gentry is an amazing, somewhat unsung artist. This box set has all seven of her albums – the last one was in 1971 – plus tons of unreleased stuff. She is one of the few people who said: “I’m going to go away” and meant it. She really knew what she was doing in every area: singing, songwriting, choreography. She was often producing her music but didn’t get credit for it. I think the reason she quit and disappeared was because she was a woman who wasn’t being taken seriously in the music industry. She probably just got fed up with it and said: “Nah, I don’t need this.”",Arts/Music,On my radar: Mark Oliver Everett’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/22/on-my-radar-mark-oliver-everetts-cultural-highlights
1/23/2022,"Kenneth Branagh’s unabashedly feelgood memoir of growing up in Belfast as the Troubles erupted in the late 1960s suffers from a problem of perspective. Canted camera angles are rendered in flat, too-clean black and white; the film leans hard into its deliberately skewed child’s point of view. Nine-year-old Buddy (newcomer Jude Hill) hops, skips and jumps through rows of chocolate-box terrace houses to a bouncy soundtrack of Van Morrison. His family, which includes Judi Dench and Ciarán Hinds’s cutesy Granny and Pop, find solace at the movies. Buddy’s family are Protestants; their Catholic neighbours will soon be driven out of their homes by sectarian hostility. Jamie Dornan’s Pa is a labourer working in England who returns home to a growing pile of unpaid bills and violence brewing on the streets. The impressionable Buddy is encouraged by a schoolfriend to loot a supermarket; implausibly, Ma (Caitríona Balfe) marches him back into the thick of the violence to return a box of stolen washing powder.  The patina of nostalgia is used to avoid contextualising the Troubles, something the family feels separate from. A 30-year conflict that started with civil rights protests is boiled down to a vague problem of “bloody religion”. After all, Buddy’s crush is a Catholic. “She could be a vegetarian antichrist for all I care,” Pa reassures him.",Arts/Film,Belfast review – Branagh’s chocolate box vision of his childhood,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/belfast-review-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-judi-dench-ciaran-hinds-feelgood-memoir
1/23/2022,"It is too easy to fall down rabbit holes of old festival sets on YouTube. I’ve revisited the ones I first saw on TV – PJ Harvey in a pink catsuit, singing Down by the Water at Glastonbury, broadcast on Channel 4 in 1995 into my childhood front room, changing my tastes forever – and later, the ones where I can try to see if I was in the crowd, while suspecting it’s probably best to not know. There is something that almost every one of the shows that took place before, roughly, the mid-00s, has in common: they are strikingly un-produced. Nirvana at Reading festival in 1992 is music history, but watch it again now: it’s three blokes playing their instruments on a vast, open stage. The razzle-dazzle, arena-show-style spectacles we’ve grown used to, the big screens, light shows, costume changes, fireworks that put New Year’s Eve to shame, are relatively new.  I mention all of this because of Bono, who has just admitted to not really liking the name U2, or his own voice on many of his records, or a lot of his lyrics, and to turning “the colour of scarlet” if one of U2’s songs come on the radio when he’s in a car. “I’m just embarrassed,” he told the Hollywood Reporter’s Awards Chatter podcast, in an interview to discuss their new song for the animated children’s film Sing 2. Generally, I lack patience with artists who criticise their most popular work. It seems rude to the people who love it, have cried to it or walked down the aisle to it (although the latter is unlikely to be a problem for Radiohead’s beef with Creep, for example). But Bono went on to explain that being embarrassing is probably part of what makes U2 so successful. “I do think U2 pushes out the boat on embarrassment quite a lot. And maybe that’s the place to be as an artist.” U2 are never knowingly understated, not the kind of act who would turn up for a big show with just their instruments. Not many artists at a certain level would any more. When I did see U2 at Glastonbury, they not only brought the razzle-dazzle of a massive production, despite the rain, but got an astronaut on the International Space Station to beam down to Earth to introduce Beautiful Day. There is a kind of blind sincerity to a gesture as grand as that. They are an all-or-nothing band and thrive on it, on pushing out the boat on embarrassment. And there are far worse band names than U2. During the first lockdown, some began to sound the death knell for the bra. For women who could work at home, an uncomfortable bra seemed increasingly pointless. Who needed the sweet relief of removing one at the end of the day if you didn’t have to put one on in the first place? According to YouGov, around one-third of women reported wearing a bra less often than usual. But bras did not die. They evolved. In the US, sales increased, thanks to a growing appetite for sports bras and bralettes. The only thing on the way out was the underwire. It makes perfect sense, then, for Vicky McClure to opt for no makeup and a crop top when playing her latest character, a bomb disposal expert, in the new series Trigger Point. The trailer has been running since Christmas and it makes a panic attack look like a spa weekend. It’s from the makers of Line of Duty, who know a thing or two about tension, and with the added pressure of regular explosions, I imagine it won’t be laid back. McClure told the Radio Times that her choices were to make the character “human”. “I didn’t want the character to make a big deal about the way she looks,” she said. I tried to imagine the alternative, a woman with a full face of slap and a cleverly enhanced cleavage, rolling around in dust, trying to snip the right wire. It says something that it’s too ridiculous to even conceive of it. The Tomb Raider days of action heroines who look as if they’re more likely to totter over than win a fight are long gone – it’s the Ellen Ripley model that has endured. Zara Rutherford landed in Belgium and set a world record, becoming the youngest woman to fly around the world solo, at the age of 19. She flew 32,000 miles in 155 days, including a two-month delay, getting stuck in Russia and Alaska as a result of adverse weather and visa issues. It sounds like a wild and at times perilous adventure. She flew through wildfire smoke in California and -20C air over Siberia. The video of her climbing out of the cockpit at the end of her journey and hugging her family (both parents are pilots) is utterly delightful and lovely. My favourite novel of last year was Great Circle, by Maggie Shipstead, which told the story of a fictional early 20th-century aviator and her struggle to complete her own circumnavigation of the globe. It consumed me. Rutherford wants to use her trip to nudge more girls and young women into science, technology, engineering and maths careers. Certainly, aviation could do with the help: only 5.8% of commercial pilots worldwide are female and 4.7% in the UK. Rutherford’s journey, and Shipstead’s imagination, may begin to sow the seeds of possibility in young women’s minds.

1/23/2022,"If this is to be the last east Midlands derby for a long time, then at least it will live long in the memory. James Garner helped create both goals for Nottingham Forest, whose push for a play-off place will be boosted by extending the longest unbeaten league run in this fixture to nine matches. Derby, whose survival hopes were strengthened on the eve of the game by news of a firm £28m bid from the founders of the US-based investment group Carlisle Capital, lost for the first time in six Championship games – but if they avoid liquidation and go down to League One, at least they know there is heart in the club.  Forest deserved to win, courtesy of second-half goals from Lewis Grabban and Brennan Johnson, before the game exploded dramatically around the final whistle. Tom Lawrence’s penalty set up a furious finale before Ravel Morrison was sent off for lunging in on Philip Zinckernagel, sparking the first of two melees involving the majority of players. The first half was a cautious affair. Lawrence, whose two goals saw Derby to victory over Sheffield United last week, should have scored in the 16th minute when he executed a perfect one-two with Colin Kazim-Richards only to sidefoot wide from 10 yards. Pushing Ryan Yates into midfield helped Forest take control of the game, though, and it was his shot from 20 yards that gave them their first clear chance, with Ryan Allsop spooning the ball behind for a corner. Keinan Davis was then sent racing through by Jack Colback’s pass just before half-time but Allsop was out swiftly to clear the high bouncing ball. Davis, on loan from Aston Villa, crumpled into a heap as Forest cried for sanction but none was forthcoming. Three minutes into the second half, the game caught fire. Scott McKenna headed Garner’s free-kick back into the middle, where Davis laid the ball back for Steve Cook. When the recent signing’s shot was blocked, the ball fell for Grabban to continue his recent goalscoring form. Red flares were immediately lit in the Bridgford End and emotions spilled over as the police had to intervene between rival fans seeking to get closer. “Derby are going down with a fiver in the bank,” gloated the Forest fans as their own side sought to capitalise on their advantage. Davis should have scored from close range soon after, only for Allsop to save. The Derby manager, Wayne Rooney, introduced three attacking substitutions in Morrison and the youngsters Luke Plange and Louie Sibley, taking the number of academy graduates used to seven (as well as the ex-Ram Max Lowe on the other side). As a result, the game became more stretched. It was no great surprise, then, when a second goal arrived eight minutes from time, and it deservedly fell to Forest. Again Garner was the architect: his nonchalant pass as he broke into midfield released Zinckernagel down the left, and the substitute’s low cross was turned in by Brennan Johnson for his seventh goal of the season. It seemed as if that would be that, but Derby do not lie down readily. When Cook scythed down Lawrence three minutes from time, the Derby captain picked himself to slot home the penalty, his eighth goal of the season. The communal intake of breath around the ground as the board went up to indicate six added minutes could be heard all the way down Brian Clough Way, but Forest held on to further turn the screw on their troubled rivals.",Sport/Football,Brennan Johnson sinks Derby as Nottingham Forest win after fiery finale,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/nottingham-forest-derby-championship-match-report
1/23/2022,"Duncan Ferguson’s pre-match preparations extended to leaving money behind the bar at the Winslow Hotel and the Brick, two Evertonian boozers near Goodison Park, to buy fans a first drink before kick-off against Aston Villa. The caretaker manager was unable to deliver what they craved most of all, however, as Steven Gerrard tormented Goodison Park once again to maintain Villa’s upward momentum and deepen Everton’s relegation fears. The best player on the pitch, Emiliano Buendía, scored the only goal of a fractious game marred by Villa players being struck by a plastic bottle in the celebrations that followed the Argentina midfielder’s decisive header.  If Everton thought the presence of a popular figure in the dugout and an open letter from Farhad Moshiri, the owner, would airbrush their problems they were forced to think again. Several hundred fans staged a sit-in protest after the game calling for the departure of Bill Kenwright as chairman and the board. The presence in the directors’ box of Kia Joorabchian, the agent closest to Everton’s majority shareholder, suggested there is no appetite for change among those running the club just yet. Ferguson’s team selection underlined his thoughts on the brief and divisive era of Rafael Benítez. Séamus Coleman, Michael Keane and Allan dropped to the bench while the new full-backs Vitalii Mykolenko and Nathan Patterson, signed for a combined initial cost of £29m at the start of the window, did not make the match-day squad at all. Yerry Mina was named captain on his first start since 6 December. Given the Scot’s demand for greater aggression from an underachieving team and a pumped-up Goodison crowd, it was no surprise that a scrap unfolded from the outset. Abdoulaye Doucouré tearing apart Jacob Ramsey’s shirt was a neat metaphor for the early exchanges. It was a contest full of South American needle, not South American flair, although Buendía shone amid the rough throughout. Philippe Coutinho was fairly anonymous on his first Villa start but would play a role in the decisive breakthrough in first-half stoppage time. The only creativity and threat on display in the first half came from the visitors. Everton did not have an attempt on target. Douglas Luiz swept an early free-kick just over Jordan Pickford’s crossbar and Buendía, who regularly sliced through Everton’s central midfield with ease, drew the first save from the England goalkeeper with a low drive from distance. Ollie Watkins had a clearer opportunity when a long ball caught out a hesitant Mina and released the Villa forward through on goal. Pickford raced out, forcing Watkins to poke wide, and their subsequent collision sparked a penalty appeal from the Villa striker. Craig Pawson and VAR disagreed. A Villa breakthrough, you felt, would have the duel effect of lessening Goodison’s intensity as well as preying on Everton’s vulnerable confidence. Pickford was proving a stubborn obstacle, however. The keeper saved superbly with his leg to deny Watkins, even if the Villa striker was offside when heading Buendía’s cross towards the bottom corner, and tipped over a Coutinho header following a Luiz free-kick. The resulting corner had dire repercussions for Everton on and off the pitch. Lucas Digne, sold to Villa following a falling-out with Benítez just days before his adversary was sacked, was roundly booed on his swift return to Goodison. Had Benítez not been dismissed his reception might have been different. Digne responded with his feet, delivering an inswinging corner to the near post where the completely unmarked Buendía glanced a superb header over Pickford and Andros Townsend into the far corner. While Everton players argued over conceding yet another set-piece goal Villa’s celebrated in front of the Bullens Road stand. A seemingly full bottle of Lucozade was thrown from the Everton crowd, who had already lowered the tone with a desperate old song about Gerrard, and both Digne and Matty Cash were struck on the head. Everton responded by announcing that anyone found throwing objects on the pitch faced arrest and would also be banned by the club. After the match the club announced that police had arrested a supporter at Goodison Park for throwing a missile on to the pitch. On the pitch, Everton improved in the second half to present a stern test of Villa’s resilience. The visitors showed they are becoming a team of substance under Gerrard in that department, too. Ferguson wasted little time in making substitutions, introducing Anthony Gordon and Allan early, and the former created a glorious chance for Dominic Calvert-Lewin with a whipped first-time cross along the face of the Villa goal. Calvert-Lewin, evidently rusty after four months out injured, turned the cross high over Emiliano Martínez’s goal at full stretch. Tyrone Mings headed off the line from Ben Godfrey, Mina sent a looping header just wide and Demarai Gray fired wildly over, all from Gordon corners as Everton applied concerted pressure in the second half. But to no avail. The two clubs continue to head in opposite directions.",Sport/Football,Buendía downs Everton but bottle incident mars Aston Villa victory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/22/everton-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
1/23/2022,"The Fox News host Tucker Carlson has compared coronavirus vaccine mandates imposed by Joe Biden’s government to medical experiments conducted by Nazi Germany and imperial Japan.  “I thought that we had a kind of consensus,” Carlson said on Friday. “I mean, after watching what the imperial Japanese army and the Nazis did in their medical experiments, I thought that American physicians agreed that compulsory medical care was unethical, it was immoral and it could never be imposed on anyone. When did we forget that?” Carlson’s guest, the virologist and anti-vaxxer Robert Malone, said: “Apparently about a year ago, I think yesterday” – a reference to Biden’s inauguration on 20 January 2021 – “was when we must have forgotten that, although Mr Biden prior to his election made clear statements that he wasn’t going to force vaccination.” On 4 December 2020, after his election victory, Biden told reporters: “No, I don’t think [vaccines] should be mandatory. I wouldn’t demand to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power.” Carlson is vastly influential, commanding huge audiences in primetime. He has promoted resistance to vaccine mandates and conspiracy theories about the effects of the shots. It is not known if he is vaccinated but Fox News has strict rules for its staff. Carlson’s exchange with Malone came on the day a judge in Texas blocked the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for federal employees. The White House said 98% of such employees had been vaccinated or were seeking a religious or medical exemption and added that it was confident it had the legal authority to impose the mandate in question. Earlier this month, the supreme court blocked a mandate for large businesses but allowed a requirement for healthcare facilities. A mandate for federal contractors was blocked by a judge in December. More than 864,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US. Federal authorities say 75.4% of eligible Americans have had at least one vaccine dose, 63.3% are considered fully vaccinated with two doses, and 39.5% have had a booster shot. Carlson’s comparison of mandates to tortures inflicted by totalitarian regimes came not long after a Fox News contributor, Lara Logan, compared Biden’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, to the Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Fox News has distanced itself from Logan. She has reportedly lost her agent. On Friday, Malone referred to the process by which Nazi leaders were brought to account, saying: “Thank you for bringing up the Nuremberg trials, Tucker. They are crucial biomedical ethics matter. And this is frankly illegal and I’m so glad that the courts are making it clear. “It’s unfortunate that so many federal workers and so many members of our military had been forced to take these products while they’re still experimental, against their will.” Fox News did not immediately return a request for comment.",News/Media,Tucker Carlson compares US vaccine mandates to ‘Nazi medical experiments’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/22/tucker-carlson-compares-us-vaccine-mandates-nazi-medical-experiments
1/23/2022,"An army of western social media influencers, each with hundreds of thousands of followers on TikTok, Instagram or Twitch, is set to spread positive stories about China throughout next month’s Winter Olympics. Concerned about the international backlash against the Beijing Games amid a wave of diplomatic boycotts, the government has hired western PR professionals to spread an alternative narrative through social media.  In November, as Joe Biden mulled a diplomatic boycott, Vipinder Jaswal, a US-based Newsweek contributor and former Fox News and HSBC executive, signed a $300,000 contract with China’s consulate general in New York to “strategise and execute” an influencer campaign promoting the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics in the US. The contract, which has been registered with the US Department of Justice, lays out a detailed public relations strategy. According to the agreement, between 22 November and 13 March, when the Winter Paralympics end, each influencer would be asked to produce three to five “deliverables”, meaning content that is crafted to fit the targeted audience. Jaswal claims his company has received up to 50 pitches from influencers ranging from former Olympians to entrepreneurs. The contract states that 70% of the content will be culture-related, including Beijing’s history, cultural relics, modem life of people and new trends. Another 20% will highlight “cooperation and any good things in China-US relations”, including high-level bilateral changes and positive outcomes. Jaswal, who was born in the UK, received $210,000 shortly after the contract was sealed with Chinese diplomats, he told the Observer. He promised Beijing that his influencers would bring an estimated 3 million impressions on social media platforms frequently used by young Americans. He said he was well aware of the controversies that surround China’s policies in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, but “what we are trying to do is to simply highlight the integrity and dignity of the Olympics”, he said. “Boycotts don’t help mutual understanding … I don’t support boycotts. They are ineffective, irrelevant and inconsequential.” Jaswal’s Beijing contract comes at a time of precarious bilateral relations between China and the US. He is under heavy scrutiny since his contract with the Chinese consulate. On 3 January, Republican senator Rick Scott urged in a letter to Newsweek’s top brass to “reconsider its relationship with Vipp Jaswal”. Last month, Biden announced his administration will stage a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics, in a show of disagreement with the Chinese government’s treatment of people in the Xinjiang Uyghur region. Several US allies, including the UK and Australia, have since joined calls not to send government officials to China. For more than a decade, China has been ramping up its overseas messaging effort through state-sponsored media outlets. It spent nearly $60m in the US in 2020, according to Open Secrets, an organisation based in Washington DC that tracks money in American politics. The funding included money for the state broadcaster CCTV’s US branch and the China Daily newspaper. American businesses, including Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Airbnb, Intel and Visa, are among the 13 top partners of the forthcoming Games. Other sponsors range from the Japanese carmaker Toyota, to German financial services firm Allianz, and French information technology consultancy Atos. In November, human rights organisations accused western corporate sponsors of “squandering the opportunity” to pressure China to address its “appalling human rights record”. “Businesses need to know that under the UN guiding principles on business and human rights, they have a responsibility to identity and mitigate human rights risks, and that helping [the] Chinese government’s reputation laundering is risking being complicit in those abuses,” said Wang Yaqiu, a senior researcher on China at Human Rights Watch. The Chinese government has consistently denied allegations of human rights abuses within its own territory.",News/World news,China hires western TikTokers to polish its image during 2022 Winter Olympics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/22/china-hires-western-tiktokers-to-polish-its-image-during-2022-winter-olympics
