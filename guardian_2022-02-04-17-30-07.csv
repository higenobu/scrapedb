2/4/2022,"There was a time, maybe a decade and a half ago, when the documentary series format primarily existed as a kind of freak show. You’d tune in and watch an hour of a couple that had an unmanageable number of children, or a shut-in with a fear of buttons, or a girl who only ate hair. In retrospect, the whole thing was creepy and exploitative, and the fact that shows like these don’t exist as much any more is a sign of humanity’s ability to improve.  Or at least it was, because now there’s a show called Adults Adopting Adults, and good Lord the bad old days are here again. Adults Adopting Adults is exactly what it sounds like. There are a bunch of grownups, seemingly happy with their life, who decided to adopt other grownups for a variety of reasons. And while a universe theoretically exists in which Adults Adopting Adults is a sober look at the rationale behind such a momentous decision, this is clearly not that universe. Adult adoption appears to be one of those grey areas that varies in terms of legality wherever you go. It’s illegal in the UK, for instance, but American regulations vary from state to state. Some require the birth parents to be notified, others require the adoptee to have diminished capacity. Others just let anyone go hell for leather. Anyone. Take Ohio residents Danny and Christy. They’ve made the decision to adopt a 20-year-old woman from Austria who they found on social media and have never actually met. Why? It’s hard to say, although it immediately becomes clear that one half of the marriage is much more into the idea than the other. That half is Danny, a man who had previously attempted to adopt a different woman, only for the process to go wrong because he developed romantic feelings for her. And now he’s doing it again. And also he has a history of cheating on his wife. Christy, meanwhile, is much less willing to let a stranger into her house. She resents spending money on her adopted adult daughter. She buys a trailer for her to live in. Her friends tell her that they want to kill Danny. Gradually, and publicly, Christy starts to unspool. On the basis of the first two episodes alone, Christy looks to all the world like a woman who has accidentally stumbled into a horror movie. It’s genuinely very upsetting to watch. And this is the problem. Perhaps the producers of Adults Adopting Adults fixed themselves with a sheen of compassion, convincing themselves that this would be a sensitive depiction of a little-understood process. But that very tangibly is not what it is. Large portions of Adults Adopting Adults is a middle-aged woman sobbing uncontrollably into an iPhone. If there’s a duty of care involved anywhere here at all, it disappears completely during Christy’s segments. True, not all the adoptions on the show are as out and out troubling as Danny and Christy’s. We meet two grownup children who want to adopt their long-term foster carers, which seems more of a ratification of an existing relationship than anything more sinister. Later in the series we are promised an ageing German prince who wants to adopt an adult so he has someone to pass his inheritance to. And that’s obviously not conventional. That’s a nightmarish cross between Willy Wonka and Amour. But, hey, whatever, let the man have his fun. Others, meanwhile, come close. One woman, under the despairing gaze of her long-suffering husband, decides that she wants to be adopted so that her children can have grandparents. The problem is, they already have grandparents, because her mother is still alive. They’re estranged, but not so estranged that the woman can’t drag an entire camera crew to her mother’s house to inform her that she has been replaced. The mother, for what it’s worth, responds in exactly the same way anyone else would. There is also the woman who chooses to adopt a 23-year-old woman despite the fact that the last time she attempted anything like this, her ex-husband had sex with her new adult daughter. Of this newest daughter, the woman gazes at her second husband and coos, “She’s a daddy’s girl.” I cannot tell you what happened after that, because my entire house suddenly became full of red flags and my view of the television was obstructed. You have to assume that most people who adopt adults do it simply for the paperwork, that they’re underlining a pre-existing relationship to spare legal difficulties in the event of their death. But Adults Adopting Adults is aggressively uninterested in this aspect of the process. It’s a show that willingly splashes around in the muddy waters of exploitation. As such, it isn’t something you’d want to watch a lot of. I certainly won’t, although I might skip ahead to the finale to make sure that Christy is OK.",Arts/Television & radio,Adults Adopting Adults: a reality show even stranger than it sounds,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/04/adults-adopting-adults-reality-tv-show
2/4/2022,"Regina sets between six and seven alarms each morning and ‘snoozes’ each one  I’m fundamentally opposed to the snooze button but my girlfriend, Regina, loves it. I don’t snooze because it’s not enjoyable. You’re left thinking about the alarm going off again; you’re neither fully asleep nor awake. Why not just set it and get up when it goes off? Regina sets between six and seven alarms each morning and “snoozes” each one. She likes a gradual way of getting up whereas I prefer to do it immediately. I’m awake on the first alarm. I stay over at Regina’s four times a week and I have to adapt. I lie there in bed, waiting. Sometimes I reach over her to turn off an alarm, which is a lot of effort. I often feel as though I’m simply an extension of her alarm clock. The snooze button impacts our morning routine. There have been a few times when alarms have been ringing hours later, while she’s showering or downstairs. It can be crazy. It also means I never know when to make my coffee. I like to make our coffees at the same time, but I can never tell when Regina will actually wake up. Sometimes I will have to wait anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes before I get my coffee. On her phone, Regina has every alarm she’s ever set, as she never deletes them. I find that wild. The ringtone is also the default iPhone one, a loud clanging noise which is really aggressive. Regina claims to be a morning person but she’s not. A morning person is someone who doesn’t need multiple alarms and gets up straight away, ready to embrace the day. That’s me. There’s also the issue of how she makes me feel if I’m getting up earlier than her: I’m accused of being functional, efficient and boring, when really I’m just organised. If Regina was able to get up when the first alarm went off, we could use the spare time to have a coffee and chat instead of snoozing until the last second before she has to rush to join an online meeting. If we want an extra half an hour in bed, we should set the alarm for later and get up then. In my book, those are the only two options. Harry needs to relax and embrace the snooze time. I enjoy it and it means I won’t be late for things I am a morning person. I like the start of the day. I like to get up and be productive. It’s just that the period before 8am is really difficult for me. When Harry suggests setting the alarm half an hour later and getting up then, he’s missing the point. I don’t want to maximise the amount of time I sleep. For me the period of snoozing is enjoyable in itself. I like to snooze for around half an hour. I like to wake up gently and process what I’m going to do that day. I’m semiconscious. It’s a nice experience. I set seven alarms every day and will snooze all of them, but it’s a necessary process for me to get up. I’ve had a few close misses with things in the past – that’s why I love setting multiple alarms. Recently I woke up 15 minutes before a hospital appointment and it had been scheduled for months. Snoozing is great as it buys me extra time, but if you don’t set enough alarms, then sleeping can be dangerous. Harry says he doesn’t recognise the nice things about snoozing but I have sometimes seen him fall back asleep at the weekends. He is very strategic and organised, so he doesn’t get my point that it’s nice to ease yourself into the day. Sometimes when we wake up, Harry will say “I’m awake now” in a very instructive tone when I’m snoozing, implying that I have to wake up with him. But if it’s not my time I won’t get up. I set fewer alarms when Harry stays over, so he’s probably right when he says he is my alarm clock; I do rely on him a bit more. I’m organised, but probably not as much as Harry. He’s never late for things whereas I usually always am. I can try and set fewer alarms when Harry is with me, but I don’t trust myself to rely on just one or two when he’s not there. Harry needs to relax and embrace the snooze time and make good use of it. He’s not missing out on the day because the alarm goes off and we snooze through it before we need to get up – that’s the whole point. Should Regina ditch her multiple alarms? I’m on Team Regina, though I enjoy the image of Harry’s rage growing with each clang of the alarm. Harry seems fixated on Regina’s habits and implies that she is lacking in organisation skills. He could ask her to find a less intrusive alarm. Even simpler – just get out of bed, Harry.Emily, 37 Regina is not guilty. Everyone’s morning routine is unique. If Harry cares for Regina, he should respect her ritual and accommodate something his girlfriend values. If Harry wants a coffee he should make one!Ewan, 55 I’m with Harry on this one – nothing induces a reaction like an alarm clock, so to hear it multiple times in one morning is enough to drive anyone up the wall. I recommend he try a judicious application of his cold feet, or a theatrical turn-over-and-steal-the-duvet manoeuvre. Harry could just get up and exit quietly to have a coffee in peace – but where’s the fun in that?Sophie, 29 Repeated alarms would annoy me too but Harry doesn’t have to be a martyr. He can get up and enjoy a leisurely coffee while Regina snoozes. But Regina should accept that a truly organised morning person wouldn’t behave like that.Linda, 60 Harry needs to be more understanding as Regina’s snoozes are part of her wake-up routine. Harry can always get out of bed on the first alarm and start the day without her. Regina could swap the clangy iPhone alarm though.James, 29 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Regina stop relying on the snooze button?

2/4/2022,"When Peh Reh’s* mother, Mi Nya*, lost contact with him in September, she had little doubt as to where he had gone. Four months earlier, the 19-year-old had told her he wanted to join the armed resistance against the military, which had seized power from the democratically-elected government in Myanmar in February 2021. Yet she refused to let him leave their home in Myanmar’s south-eastern Karenni state (also known as Kayah). “In my eyes, he is still so young,” she says. “If I could, I would like to keep my son next to me all the time.”  Intense fighting between armed revolutionary groups and the military had been escalating in Karenni state since May, three months after the coup. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. Like thousands of other families, Peh Reh and his family left their homes and sought shelter in the forest. There, he and his father waited for lulls in the fighting to return to tend to their farm, while his mother went deeper into the forest with the three younger children. The family tried to return home but were forced to flee a second time as the fighting escalated around their village. A few days later, Peh Reh disappeared. The next time his mother heard from him he was in a training camp for an armed revolutionary group. This time, Mi Nya decided not to stand in his way. “I told [my son] to pray and be careful at all times. I also pray for him every day” she says. Peh Reh is one of a rising number of young men and women across Myanmar leaving their families to take up arms as the country is plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement, with more than 1,400 civilians killed in military crackdowns on the pro-democracy movement since February 2021. As the people of Myanmar endure internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech, and escalating military attacks on civilian areas, many of the country’s youth have decided armed resistance is their only option. On the other side of the country in Kalay, a small city in Sagaing region near Myanmar’s north-western border with India, 21-year-old Zaw Htet* took part in the street demonstrations that erupted after the coup, while his mother went on strike from her public-sector job as part of a broader civil disobedience movement. Soon after, the military began using deadly force on protesters around the country, including in Kalay. By 28 March, protesters in the city had begun defending themselves with guns, barricading themselves behind sandbags and firing homemade weapons back at soldiers and police who attacked them with snipers, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. By the time the military destroyed the protest camp, at least 18 civilians were dead. As Zaw Htet endured this terrifying experience, his mother, Aye Mya*, was punished for joining the civil disobedience movement. The military evicted her and her family from government housing in June, and she has since been selling street food to survive. These experiences intensified both Zaw Htet’s and his mother’s hatred of the military, and when he told her he wanted to join the armed struggle, she supported him. She has only seen him once since he left in July. His absence has left her anxious about how her son is enduring the harsh conditions of life in the forest. “Now that he is a revolutionary fighter, he might be sleeping on the ground,” she says. “I worry about whether he has warm clothes or not. Whenever it rains, I worry he may be soaked.” She also follows the news with dread as clashes escalate in Kalay township, and young people are arrested and killed daily. Yet, despite this, she says she is optimistic that the young generation can succeed where, three decades ago, her generation could not. In 1988, she was active in the student-led pro-democracy protests, when the country also erupted in turmoil as the former regime arrested thousands and opened fire on crowds. Although Aye Mya initially joined those protests, she stopped when the firing started. Now, she says she is no longer afraid. “This time, the revolution is very different than in 1988. Young people today have greater knowledge of politics. They are determined and braver than us,” she says. Some mothers have joined the revolution themselves, including Shwe Yun Eain*, a 23-year-old farmer from Sagaing region’s Myaung township. In October she left her three-year-old daughter with her mother and went off to fight. “My mother told me, ‘My daughter, do not worry for your daughter. I will take good care of her. Just focus on the revolution,’” she says. “I cannot sit still while the whole nation is fighting against military dictatorship.” She has spent the past three months training with the country’s first all-female armed resistance group, the Myaung Women Warriors. Not wanting to endanger her mother or daughter by making contact, she has only seen them once since she left home. The Myaung Women Warriors’motto is “the hand that swings a baby’s hammock can also be part of the armed revolution,” and Shwe Yun Eain says that despite the hardships she faces, she remains committed to her decision. “As a mother, I have had many ups and downs since I joined the armed revolution,” she says. “I continue fighting to root out this evil system for my daughter’s future and the next generation.” * Names have been changed to protect identities.

2/4/2022,"Fears about our digital future were not assuaged last October when Mark Zuckerberg released a video trailing the delights of “the metaverse”. The Facebook supremo’s awkward presentation style made it feel like an AI-generated missive from beyond the uncanny valley. Plus, many felt there was something pretty dystopian about an immersive new online world controlled by a corporation with a track record of misinformation spreading, data gathering and disseminating harmful body images. If we’re feeling paranoid about our metaverse future, it might also have something to do with our movies. Hollywood has rarely met a new technology it couldn’t make seem terrifying and wrong. From virtual reality (the Matrix movies, Tron), to artificial intelligence (the Terminator franchise, Ex Machina, The Mitchells vs the Machines), from social media (Catfish, Eighth Grade, Unfriended) to real-life tech titans like, er, Mark Zuckerberg (The Social Network), we’ve seen enough to put us off ever going online.  All of which makes Mamoru Hosoda’s new anime, Belle, a refreshing alternative. Belle does not gloss over the harmful aspects of digital life such as online abuse, viral gossip and doxing (publicly revealing personal information). But, rather than portraying the online world as a place of cruelty and corporate overreach, it suggests it could be one of sanctuary, even salvation, especially for young people. It is a story about how virtual identities can conceal or reveal people’s hidden facets (as the title suggests, there are Beauty and the Beast parallels). Our hero is Suzu, a lonely, introverted teenager in rural Japan who lost her ability to sing after the death of mother. When she enters the huge online world of “U”, however, she becomes the exact opposite: her secret alter ego is a pink-haired pop goddess with a golden voice and millions of adoring followers. “There aren’t many directors who have shown an online world in a positive way,” says Hosoda, a bookish, mild-mannered man dressed all in black. “I think I’m a rare example, maybe the only example.” He had never heard the term “metaverse” until after Belle’s release, he says. His inspiration was watching his five-year-old daughter growing up in a world where things like smartphones and social media have always existed. “Us grownups see the internet and we think, ‘This is reality, and that’s not reality,’ but for young people it’s more: ‘This is the real world and that’s another world.’ It’s just as real and just as valuable, and how you behave in that online world is also part of reality. This is the new world they find themselves in, and it’s all about how they create that world for themselves.” The finer points of U’s tech are admittedly sci-fi. It uses “the latest body sharing technology”, which generates your avatar according to your biometric information. But as a visual representation of what a fully fledged metaverse might look like, Belle is often breathtakingly joyous and agreeably psychedelic. When we first see Suzu in her virtual persona, she is singing a pop song on the back of a huge whale encrusted with speaker cones; it is swimming through what feels like a cross between a floating city and a giant circuit board. Text comments and messages fly through the ether as she sprays virtual confetti at a colourful carnival of avatars. Farther afield in U there are gigantic spherical stadiums, ruined castles, impossibly coloured sunsets over infinite virtual plains. Mark Zuckerberg might want to take a look. Hosoda has been engaging with digital worlds for more than two decades now. He began his career with the Pokémon-like Digimon franchise, including a short film about an evil virus that consumes data and takes over the internet. It was strictly for kids, but enough to catch the attention of the mighty Studio Ghibli, which in 2001 asked him to direct Howl’s Moving Castle. However, he clashed creatively with Ghibli’s boss Hayao Miyazaki (who eventually directed the movie himself), and Hosoda went his own way. Today he is one of the most successful anime directors in Japan, thanks to hits like The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Wolf Children, The Boy and the Beast, and Belle’s Oscar-nominated predecessor, Mirai, which premiered at Cannes in 2018. A significant precursor to Belle was Hosoda’s 2009 movie Summer Wars, which also straddles real and virtual worlds. Half the story is a kind of meet-the-parents teen romcom; the other half is set in a proto-metaverse named Oz, whose hacking threatens to destroy the planet. As with Belle’s U, Oz is a visually sumptuous virtual world: this time a clean, white, pop-art realm filled with rainbow-coloured graphics and characters, designed by celebrated artist Takashi Murakami. To design Belle’s metaverse, Hosoda recruited Eric Wong, a British architect and illustrator based in London. Hosoda saw some of Wong’s mind-bogglingly detailed fantasy cityscapes online and emailed him out of the blue, Wong explains. “It all happened over the internet, which I guess is quite fitting.” Architecturally, where Summer Wars’ metaverse was organised like a giant totem pole, Belle’s U is a vast linear city made up of geometric skyscraper-like forms. Working in the evenings between his full-time job, Wong took inspiration from existing places such as New York City and Central Park, but also from movies such as Kubrick’s 2001, he says. In its defence, Hollywood has made a few attempts to depict a virtual realm that isn’t a dystopian hellscape. Steven Lisberger’s Tron, from 1982, is still a trailblazer. With its infinite black expanses, angular geometries and neon accents, it made cyberspace look like a 1980s nightclub (the 2010 sequel, Tron: Legacy, doubled down by hiring Daft Punk as DJs). More up to date is Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, from 2018, whose story hinges on a virtual leisure universe named “the Oasis”. Visually it is a mishmash of real-world and gaming landscapes, which is probably closer to what big tech’s metaverses will actually look like. The key difference is that Ready Player One is set in the year 2045, when the planet is ravaged by poverty, war and environmental collapse. “These days, reality’s a bummer; everyone’s looking for a way to escape,” its hero tells us. For all their futurism, Summer Wars and Belle contrast their virtual communities with real-world ones of family and local community. Belle’s location is modelled on an existing village in Kōchi prefecture, whose landscapes and everyday minutiae it renders in loving detail. While virtual populations are booming in the modern digital economy, rural communities are dying out in real life, Hosoda notes. “This is something that’s happening in Japan, maybe in the UK as well. The new online world, the disappearing local communities: both exist side by side.” To some extent, all of Hosoda’s stories have dealt with people torn between two worlds and two identities – by magic or time travel or digital technology. Invariably, his heroes must resolve this divide, and Belle is no exception. Only by closing the gap between their online and offline identities can the story’s central characters truly move forward. By the same token, Hosoda’s films themselves seem to negotiate the boundaries between fantasy and reality. In light of our looming metaverse future, it’s a theme that becomes ever more pertinent. “I believe things created for films can influence the real world,” he says. “Sci-fi films and novels are a prediction of the future, and they play a role in expressing it. Imagination stimulates the real world.” Reality is catching up fast, though: “Ten years ago I created an online community of 1 billion people [for Summer Wars], and then Facebook went and got 2 billion-odd users. And so I needed to make the next one bigger: U has 5 billion users.” It is a matter of time before this, too, becomes out of date, he suggests. “I would like to imagine something even further beyond, and share that future with everyone.” Rather than fearing for what lies ahead in the metaverse, Hosoda is upbeat. “I see the possibility for creating something that is truly global,” he says. “In the real world, we have languages, we have history, we have these walls between nations that are very difficult to overcome. But if those weren’t there, like on the internet, then perhaps there is a possibility to build an online community where everyone can truly belong.”  Belle is released in the UK on 4 February",Arts/Film,Bring on the metaverse!

2/4/2022,"Maya Shenfeld trained as a guitarist, learning classical guitar at university in her native Jerusalem and later playing electric guitar in assorted art projects in Berlin. You can see her online, playing her instrument through a laptop and a host of effects pedals; improvising over tape loops; or leading an ensemble of 11 guitarists to rework Julius Eastman’s minimalist classic Gay Guerrilla until it sounds like a Sonic Youth track. But Shenfeld’s debut album doesn’t feature any guitar. Instead it explores texture and grain using analogue synths, brass and human voices. A lot of music rooted in drone-based minimalism can be quite harmonically tedious, but Shenfeld’s compositions go places. Sadder Than Water, the longest track here, sounds like a Bach fugue being played in slow motion by Wendy Carlos; Body, Electric is a series of descending, constantly modulating synth arpeggios over a warm blanket of drones; Voyager sounds like one of the more compelling instrumentals from David Bowie’s Low. Shenfeld also creates space-age soundscapes using acoustic sources: the opening and closing tracks create sepulchral tones by exaggerating the natural resonances of brass instruments; while Mountain Larkspur sees her getting a youth choir to sing in ghostly, microtonal harmonies.  In Free Fall was apparently inspired by the German-Japanese artist Hito Steyerl, whose essay of the same name discusses the disappearance of the horizon and the dismantling of linear perspective. But, in finding ways of representing disorientation, Shenfeld often invokes the numinous and the transcendent. She has written about the rivalry in Israel between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv – the tragic, ancient holy city versus the groovy beachside party town – and how she identifies strongly with the former. Weirdly, that austere spirit of Jerusalem haunts the entire album – this is music that uses 21st-century technology to conjure up images of liturgical chants and ancient temples. Two New York jazz musicians, bassist Mat Muntz and drummer Vicente Hansen Atria, have collaborated as the Vex Collection (18 February, Carrier Records) to explore assorted double reed instruments, from Croatian and Highland bagpipes to instruments that they’ve invented and created using a 3D printer. The result is a series of ecstatic punky improvisations filled with a wild, distorted energy.

2/4/2022,"If you are a parent of young children who browses parenting websites, you will at some point have been pitched to about talent. You may be invited, via targeted advertising, to enrol your child in a Future School Global Maths Skill Assessment – “to see how they compare to peers globally”. You may be urged to consider the possibility – nay, probability – that they are “gifted” in some way, if not in maths, then in music or art. It’s window-dressing for lame subscription services, but the other day, assailed by this stuff, a line caught my eye that I haven’t been able to forget. “Talent isn’t everything,” read the copy. “The important thing is to teach your child to be kind.” This positioning of “kindness” as oppositional to “talent” – and the impossibility, by implication, of a predisposition towards kindness itself being regarded as “talent” – is rife once you start looking for it. Kindness is, everywhere: the consolation prize, the donkey in the nativity play, the award for perfect attendance. The metric for gifted is limited in childhood to measurable and therefore narrow results; a child might learn to read early, but disciplines requiring maturity for their impact are sealed off as forms of prodigiousness. There are no seven-year-old fiction writing prodigies. There are no prodigies in kindness, either.  A few years ago, none of this would have struck me as noteworthy. It is true that, along with a lot of other “soft” values, kindness is something one comes to appreciate more with age and exhaustion. The phrase “give me a break”, once muttered by rote and gutted of meaning, is now one I use extremely literally. Parenting changes one’s parameters, too. In line with common assumptions, I believed a predisposition towards kindness wasn’t innate, but instead something entirely reliant on cultivation. These days I wonder about that, and about our determination to see it that way. Of my two children, one can be urged, pressured, bribed or cajoled into sharing and being less grabby – behaviour, in other words, which falls squarely within the normal range. The other child, more often than not, considers and accommodates the feelings of others, naturally and without being asked. Like a tiny 40-year-old, she uses phrases like “I’m happy for her” and “No, you go ahead.” It’s weirdly mature and occasionally eerie. Which brings us to the problem of kindness; not only the fact that, in plenty of settings, it can be a code for weakness or neediness, but the fact that the word itself has been emptied out through misuse. Online, “be kind” is an order commonly used by men towards women with whom they disagree. And, like similar entreaties – “smile!” – has a silent “bitch” at the end of the phrase. Kindness in this context means giving in to another’s demands, a form of female pliancy rooted in renouncing one’s needs. Real kindness is not this. Kindness, I try to tell my children, is strength. My child with the kind disposition is frequently baffled and let down by the hostility of others, at which point I have to bite my tongue. “Jessica was a dick to you because she has vast inadequacies; and honestly, have you seen the state of her parents?” is not ammunition I’m going to give to my seven-year-old. On the other hand, it seems fair to provide her with a rudimentary knowledge of how projection and insecurity work. Frequently, these lessons go against the grain of how our culture measures success, and it’s a hard line to navigate; you can be competitive and resolute, and not a “pushover” or a “weakling”, but still factor in how other people feel. Can you teach someone to be kind? Of course, but also only sort of, not entirely. You can condition them with reason and rewards in the same way you can send them to piano every week and eventually they’ll learn to play Twinkle Twinkle. The fact remains that some people are kinder than others not as a result of external forces but from some preloaded ability we’re resistant to valorising. There are branches of therapy that frame acts of kindness as a form of self-care – much more in line with our what’s-in-it-for-me values – and the ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said, “No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.” Two thousand years later, it remains a hard sell.

2/4/2022,"Justin Langer’s fate remains unknown after the Cricket Australia board met on Friday but were unable to end six months of speculation about his future in the head coach role. After a marathon seven-hour meeting in Melbourne, the board failed to reach a resolution on the main item on the agenda. “Cricket Australia can confirm that the CA board met today and part of that meeting involved significant discussions about the men’s head coach Justin Langer’s contract,” a statement on Friday evening read. “We will now enter confidential discussions with Justin and the outcome will be announced as soon as possible.”  Langer’s contract was due to expire in June, and it was always Cricket Australia’s intention to address his future once last year’s T20 World Cup and the recent Ashes series had been completed. Both trophies were banked, but despite his on-field success, Langer’s old-school, direct style of man-management has been under scrutiny since a meeting between senior players and CA CEO Nick Hockley last August. During Langer’s time as coach since May, 2018, Australia have won 15 of 27 Tests, including retaining the Ashes in England for the first time in 18 years. In all, he has been the second most successful coach in the country’s history, behind only John Buchanan with wins in 55.5% of Tests. It was after last summer’s second home defeat to India in three years that the pressure first began to mount on Langer. White-ball series losses in West Indies and Bangladesh only added to that, before the situation seemingly reached boiling point last August amid claims he was too intense. It prompted high-powered meetings between senior players and cricket administrators, with Langers agreeing to loosen his grip on the team. Australia went on to claim their maiden T20 World Cup title in what players claimed was an enjoyable team environment. The recent 4-0 Ashes domination that followed gave Langer hope of retaining his position, before separate meetings between players, administrators and the coach last week. Friday was expected to be D-Day for the coach, however Hockley’s statement now gives them three weeks to sort the issue before the Australian team leaves for the tour of Pakistan, which was rubber-stamped on Friday. It will be the first time Australia’s men have travelled to Pakistan since 1998. Hockley said: “I would like to thank the PCB and both the Pakistan and Australian governments for ensuring the tour will proceed for the first time in 24 years. This is a historic occasion and important for the global growth and health of the game. The first of three Tests begins on 4 March, with three ODIs and a one-off T20 to be played over the course of a month in Pakistan.",Sport/Sport,Uncertainty remains over Justin Langer as Cricket Australia plan further talks,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/04/uncertainty-remains-over-justin-langer-as-cricket-australia-plan-further-talks
2/4/2022,"In 1822 Susannah Wright stood before the Lord Chief Justice accused of blasphemy. Despite her limited education, she was determined to conduct her own defence and duly began to read out a carefully prepared statement. Her “blasphemy” had nothing to do with being a potty mouth. Rather, Susannah was found guilty of selling a pamphlet that challenged the right of the Established Church to meddle in secular matters. Infuriated by the effrontery of this young lacemaker from Nottingham, the judge attempted to cut her off. Sharply, she told him to be quiet: “You, sir, are paid to hear me.”  It is a thrilling moment. It is also, suggests Nan Sloane, one that deserves to be far better known. The same goes for the many other occasions on which working-class women dared to speak truth to power during the first third of the 19th century, a time of bitter unrest when it looked as though Great Britain might follow France and America into revolution. There is, for instance, Mary Fildes, president of the Manchester Female Reform Society, who stood on the hustings alongside Henry Hunt at Peterloo in 1819 and only narrowly escaped death in the state-sanctioned carnage that followed. Or Jane Carlile who, like Susannah Wright, was found guilty of blasphemy for selling her husband’s newspaper The Republican, and was sentenced to two years inside Dorchester prison with her newborn baby. One of the reasons why these women have been “hidden from history” to use Sheila Rowbotham’s seminal phrase from nearly 50 years ago, is because working-class women generally left less of a paper trail than well-to-do activists. Mary Wollstonecraft and Anna Laetitia Barbauld, who both get a chapter, published polemics that set off political fireworks and attracted vicious personal attacks in the process (Horace Walpole famously dubbed Wollstonecraft “a hyena in a petticoat”). With the likes of Wright, Fildes and Carlile, by contrast, all we get are oblique glimpses of them in narratives written by and about the men with whom they shared their lives. The problem with this fragmentation is how difficult it makes it to recover a reforming woman’s particular journey, and see her full complexity. For instance, in 1832 Yorkshire woman Mary Smith presented parliament with a petition (or, rather, Henry Hunt did on her behalf) calling for the forthcoming Reform Bill to deliver female suffrage. In the process Smith tried to bolster her cause by dropping broad hints that William Cobbett, the great reformer who was a staunch advocate for male suffrage only, had recently been caught in a clinch with another man. As repugnant as this homophobia seems today, it is a reminder that real women living in historical time will not always think and act in ways that we find easy to understand. There is another reason, suggests Sloane, that this early generation of female radicals still gets overlooked. All too often feminist history gets written exclusively in terms of the slow march towards female voting rights, which was not finally achieved for another 100 years. But many of the women from this earlier period were more concerned with the immediate challenge of keeping their families fed and warm. One of the saddest things about Sloane’s narrative is its heavy load of infant mortality, against which background desperately poor women march for bread and smash machinery in protest at the consequences of unregulated capitalism. The vote, for them, is a luxury that will have to wait.  Uncontrollable Women: Radicals, Reformers and Revolutionaries by Nan Sloane is published by IB Tauris (£20).
