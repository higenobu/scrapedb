4/7/2022,"Ashapeshifting bird has descended on our stretch of the River Ivel. It turns heads, commands attention, and fits the descriptions of both dainty and dumpy. My eyes lifted the other day from a pair of swans scudding across the mill pool towards the far side, where the river resumes its narrowed course. There was white beyond white, a little egret poking around the margins with such assurance and precision that it reminded me of a decisive shopper – one of those, one of those and, yes, I’ll take two of those. Over the winter, egrets were jittery, flighty visitors here, apt to lift off and swirl in agitation whenever I came into view. But this one, closer than any hitherto, once I had walked along the bank to confront it, was unfazed. Egrets do dainty. Moments earlier, its elfin figure, slight and slender, light on Marmite-dark pins, gave a twist of the head, a flick to the left, nod to the right. Poke, prod, jab. And then up it rose, flapped a little way, before settling as a no-neck dumpy heron. A row of birds perched on the river-spanning cage around a gas pipe: a sentry line of three black-headed gulls with chocolate heads, plus now the egret tagged on the end. I’d never seen any other bird share the gulls’ stance before, but they looked unbothered, maybe because the taller egret immediately shrank into itself so that it was just one of the gulls. Members of the heron family have a tendency towards habitual behaviour, and it wasn’t a complete surprise to find the egret on the same perch 24 hours later. The gulls were gone. The bird, exposed and hunched, eyed a man and a dog who were walking the bank towards it. The egret turned its head by degrees to see them off. Just then a light breeze arose, ruffling the compact shape, lifting a nuptial plume briefly from its nape as if it were a curl out of place. Was this one of a breeding pair, perhaps?

4/7/2022,"After two weeks of no news, Alexsandr Obedinsky cried with happiness when he received a video call from his granddaughter, Kira. The last time he knew her whereabouts was just after her father was killed, shot on the balcony of the family’s Mariupol apartment by a Russian sniper. In the aftermath, contact with the 12-year-old girl was lost.Obedinsky had already managed to flee the besieged city for the relative safety of western Ukraine, but his son and Kira’s father, Evgeny, had refused to consider the dangerous journey. His death left Kira an orphan as her mother died two weeks after she was born.After Evgeny was killed, his partner, Anya, tried to take Kira and her own children on foot out of the city. What happened next is unclear and Obedinsky’s joy at realising Kira was alive quickly turned to fear when he realised where she was.“She was in a hospital bed, she had shrapnel wounds around her ear and face and her legs, but she seemed OK. I was so relieved. But she told me she’s in Donetsk, and it seems like she’s on her own. She told me they’re taking her to a Russian city.”The southern port city of Mariupol has been a big focus of Russia’s now six-week-old invasion of Ukraine: capturing it would link other parts of the Donbas region – such as Donetsk, which has been de-facto Russian-controlled since 2014 – with the Russian mainland.As a result, Mariupol has faced some of the worst suffering in the conflict to date. Approximately 150,000 or so of the city’s prewar population of 400,000 are still trapped by the Russian ground forces encircling the area, with diminishing supplies of water, food, medicine and fuel. All the while, besieged residents have faced airstrikes and shelling, which have killed an estimated 5,000 people. This is the situation that Anya, Evgeny’s partner, decided she and the children had to escape after his death on 17 March. From what Kira told her grandfather, it seems the family and a group of neighbours walked for around two days before coming across a minefield, which killed a little boy and injured Kira. The girl was picked up by Russian soldiers and taken to a hospital in Donetsk, where doctors said they’d take care of her, allow her access to her phone to call Obedinsky and eventually send her to a new home in Russia.“She is so scared. She doesn’t know where or why she is going,” the 67-year-old said.“I can’t say for sure what she understands about what’s going on and the war … She’s seen people killed in front of her, explosions and shelling. She just wants to come back to her family and come back home.”The Guardian has previously reported that Russia is sending Ukrainian citizens from Mariupol to “filtration camps” in Russian-controlled areas before forcibly relocating them to Russia, which is considered a war crime under international humanitarian law. A satellite image captured by US-based Maxar Technologies last week showed tented camps set up in the Russian-controlled village of Bezimenne, near Novoazovsk, and representatives of the two self-proclaimed republics in Donbas said they have set up a “tent city” for those fleeing Mariupol, which can host up to 450 people. The scale of Russia’s reported forced deportations remains unclear. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of transferring 40,000 people to its territory, a claim the Russian authorities deny. Russia media outlets have reported that hundreds of Ukrainian refugees have been sent by train to the northern regions of Yaroslavl and Ryazan. Obedinsky is desperately afraid that Kira is about to become one of that number. “I’m waiting for Kira to be able to call back again and she can tell me what’s going on,” he said. “I didn’t hear from my son for days before he was killed and, even up until the last second, I was waiting for good news. I just pray God will protect her and we can bring her home.”",News/World news,‘She is so scared’: man who fled Mariupol fears granddaughter might be taken to Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/she-so-scared-man-fled-mariupol-fears-granddaughter-might-be-taken-russia
4/7/2022,"Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said new sanctions by the west against Russia do not go far enough and will be seen by invading forces as a “permission to attack”, as fears of an assault on the east of the country intensify. It comes after the US, UK and EU unveiled a raft of new sanctions targeting Russian banks and the country’s elites. The US measures include a ban on investing in Russia as well as sanctions on president Vladimir Putin’s adult daughters. The EU sanctions include a ban on coal imports and restrictions on banks. “This package has a spectacular look. But this is not enough,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. “If there is no really painful package of sanctions against Russia and if there is no supply of weapons … it will be considered by Russia as a permission. A permission to attack,” he said, calling for the west to reject Russian oil and completely block the country’s banks from the international finance system. Zelenskiy also said, without providing evidence, that Russian troops were now trying to cover up atrocities in Ukraine. Grisly images of dead civilians in the streets of Bucha this week sparked international condemnation and calls for Russian forces to be tried for war crimes. The UN general assembly will vote on Thursday on whether to suspend Russia from the UN premier human rights body in the wake of the discoveries. Russia has denied responsibility and suggested the images were fake or the deaths occurred after its troops pulled out. However, satellite images show that bodies were lying on streets in Bucha for days before Russian troops left the town. “Russia’s participation on the Human Rights Council is a farce,” US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said this week. In other developments: The Pentagon said a “small number” of Ukrainian soldiers are being trained in the United States to operate the deadly Switchblade drones that Washington is supplying to Kyiv. The troops were already in the US before Russia invaded. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby offered some optimism about the Ukraine resistance. “Of course, they can win this. And if you look at what they’ve been able to do just thus far, Mr Putin has achieved exactly zero of his strategic objectives inside Ukraine,” he said. Nato foreign ministers will meet in Brussels on Thursday for two days of talks on providing support to bring an end to the war. US sanctions against two of Russia’s largest banks are “a direct blow to the Russian population [and] ordinary citizens”, Tass news agency cited Russia’s US ambassador as saying on Wednesday. Anatoly Antonov made his remarks after Washington hit Sberbank and Alfabank. Ahead of an expected Russian military assault in the coming days, Ukraine has urged civilians to leave the east of the country “while the opportunity still exists”. The deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said the authorities would “not be able to help” residents who stayed behind once large-scale fighting erupted. She said the governors of the Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk regions were calling on people to move immediately to safer areas. “It has to be done now, because later people will be under fire and face the threat of death. There is nothing they will be able to do about it,” she posted on Telegram. The deputy prime minister emphasised: “It is necessary to evacuate as long as this possibility exists. For now, it still exists.” The Kremlin has said it intends to seize the entire Donetsk region, amid reports that Putin is keen to declare victory in Ukraine in time for 9 May, the annual commemoration of the Soviet defeat of Hitler in the second world war. One western official said Putin would want to have an “announceable success” by then, which could create “some tension” with Russian commanders as exhausted forces were likely to be thrown into battle fairly soon in an attempt to gain ground in the east. The new focus on the east follows the humiliating failure of Putin’s original apparent plan to seize the capital, Kyiv, overthrow the Zelenskiy government and subjugate most of Ukraine in a matter of days or weeks. Instead, Russian troops who advanced on Kyiv were forced to withdraw to Belarus after shattering losses. The Kremlin has also pulled its forces out of the Sumy region after its advance there became bogged down. According to revised estimates, 29 of Russia’s battalion tactical groups – the smallest operating unit of its forces – are now “combat non-effective”, from an invading force estimated to be at about 125 battalions, which comprises around 75% of Russia’s total army. Nato and western analysts believe Russia is now determined to consolidate its gains in the south and south-east, with the Kremlin “reshaping its narrative” so that it can redefine its idea of victory. It already controls a land corridor stretching from Mariupol along the sea of Azov to the southern Kherson province and to Crimea. Its next targets appear to be the strategic towns of Sloviansk, which Russian forces and separatists held in 2014, Kramatorsk and Sievierodonetsk. Any assault is likely to run into major resistance from the Ukrainian army. Ukraine’s military, however, had not so far been able to reinforce their own forces in the Donbas, said one western official, because they were still attempting to secure areas retaken from Russian troops, and needed to defend Kyiv against any surprise attempt to retake the capital.",News/World news,Ukraine says Russia will see new sanctions as ‘permission to attack’ amid warnings of fresh offensive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/07/ukraine-says-russia-will-see-new-sanctions-as-permission-to-attack-amid-warnings-of-fresh-offensive
4/7/2022,"Australia has been blessed with some world class sports broadcasters. Whether it’s Bruce McAvaney at the Olympics, Bill Collins calling the final furlong of a Cox Plate or Richie Benaud describing a Shane Warne leg break, they’ve been masters of their craft, and they’ve enriched our experience as fans. In recent years however, the quality of AFL commentary, particularly on Channel Seven, has plummeted. Dennis Cometti hung up the binoculars, and Bruce followed suit a couple of years later. We were left with witless, mind numbing prattle. They were shouting at us, not calling the game. They were hyperventilating when nothing was really happening, and half asleep when someone pulled down the mark of the year. As footy was becoming more congested, they were striving for superlatives, and straying into vaudeville. For a multitude of reasons, ratings were low. Given the quality of repartee, it was no surprise people were tuning out in droves. The sport had never taken itself more seriously. But footy on Seven had become a caricature of itself. Twitter is hardly a reliable barometer of public opinion, particularly when it comes to politics. Nor is it renowned for its joie de vie. But if there was one thing that could unite footy fans on social media, it was the dire state of Channel Seven’s commentary. For a while, it seemed the only solution lay in the mute button, or in pooling our life savings and paying Anthony Hudson $10m a year to call every game on the fixture. But Channel Seven did something surprising. They listened. They changed. They watered down the red cordial. And they fostered and promoted new talent. The AFLW was crucial in this regard. New and modulated voices – both men and women – were suddenly showcased to a broader audience. The penny seemed to have dropped. Viewers didn’t want a stand-up routine. They didn’t want a commentary box jammed with former legends. With little fanfare, they elevated proper broadcasters to the main commentary spots. Callers like Jason Bennett – authoritative, accurate, and economical – were suddenly calling men’s preliminary finals. Though not a play-by-play caller, Daisy Pearce provided more insights into the modern game than half a dozen hall-of-famers. This season, Alistair Nicholson crossed over from the ABC. Again, it was done with minimal fuss. Instead of “Did you see that!”, “Spot on BT”, and “Love the way he goes about it”, he called the play, he got the players’ names right, and he let the game breathe. It was no-nonsense, it was refreshing and it enhanced the viewing experience considerably. On Sunday, Matt Hill called the St Kilda-Richmond game. I’m hopelessly biased here, but I reckon he’s the best race-caller in the world. He has wonderful timing and cadences. He does his homework. He respects his audience. In a thousand metre sprint down the Flemington straight, with half the field splitting to the grandstand side, he can memorise the silks, names and jockeys of 22 horses, and still not miss a beat. Personally, having him bob up in the footy commentary box was like seeing Daniel Day Lewis treading the boards at the Titanic Theatre Restaurant. It wasn’t long ago that he was calling amateur footy on community radio. But he slotted in seamlessly. The influx of new talent has raised the standard across the board. Even some serial offenders have lifted their game. James Brayshaw’s call of Lance Franklin’s 1,000th goal was exactly what the moment called for. He let the scene speak for itself. He didn’t try and upstage it. In years gone by, you suspect he and Brian Taylor would have been running on the field themselves. On this night, less was more. This shift isn’t confined to football. For years, and particularly during home Ashes series, cricket commentary in this country was a ghastly state of affairs. But mercifully, things changed. There was a new host broadcaster. There were more women. There were fewer TV sets thrown off balconies. Finally, we could read a book, lie in a hammock or tend to a sausage while the cricket hummed in the background. Commentating a football game is a tough gig. Getting the right balance between entertainment and informative commentary, in a sport that doesn’t necessarily translate well to TV, is especially hard. In the hierarchy of footy’s grievances, Channel Seven’s commentary has tended to rank marginally ahead of Ticketek and the MCG ground announcer. On the off-chance Channel Seven bosses read the Guardian, they’re probably echoing Basil Fawlty right now – “Satisfied customer, we should have him stuffed.” But they deserve a shout out. They’ve finally struck the right tone. For the first time in a long time, they’re treating the sport and their viewers with respect.",Sport/Sport,AFL commentators strike right note for first time in a long time | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/07/afl-commentators-strike-right-note-for-first-time-in-a-long-time
4/7/2022,"A coronial inquest has found that Paddy Moriarty, who went missing from the tiny Northern Territory town of Larrimah in 2017, is dead and a feud with his nearest neighbours is likely to be the key to solving the case. Coroner Greg Cavanagh said the evidence showed that Paddy and his dog Kellie had both died some time on the evening of 16 December 2017, when they were last seen leaving the town pub and driving the short distance home on a quad bike. Cavanagh’s findings detailed a history of turmoil between Moriarty and the residents living across the road from him in the tiny town with a population of 12. The findings included allegations the missing man had repeatedly destroyed plants and possessions on the opposite property. Fran Hodgetts, who ran a Devonshire teahouse in the town, and her gardener and caretaker, Owen Laurie, lived directly opposite Moriarty. “In my opinion, Paddy and his dog were killed in the context of and likely due to the ongoing feud he had with his nearest neighbour,” Cavanagh said. “He likely died on the evening of the 16th of December 2017. “He had ridden home from the hotel, put the mostly-eaten chicken in the microwave, put his wallet on the table, his hat in the usual place, the dog food in the dog bowl and got his own meal out of the freezer. “He then went outside with the dog. There is no evidence as to where he went, however, in my view it’s likely that the new plants at Fran’s place were of some attraction to him.” Thursday’s coronial inquest finding comes after eight secret police recordings, taped on the property of Moriarty’s nearest neighbours, were played before the court. In the recordings, which also include singing, a man’s voice can be heard saying: “Fucking killed Paddy, hit him on the head. Smacked him on the fucking nostrils with my claw hammer,” and, “I killerated old Paddy … I struck him on the fucking head and killerated the bastard … basherated him”. The recordings were obtained by police in a six-month period after Moriarty went missing. Laurie on Wednesday told the court the voice was not his and that he did not know anything about Moriarty’s disappearance. He opted to remain silent on the basis that anything he said could incriminate him. The Coroner’s Act does not permit a finding that might suggest an individual may be guilty of an offence, and the matter has now been referred to the commissioner of police and the Director of Public Prosecutions for further action or investigation. Officer in charge of the investigation, Det Sgt Matt Allen, said Moriarty’s disappearance was a “once in a generation case”. “Murder investigations are challenging, particularly without a body,” he said. “The case doesn’t get closed until it is solved. We need to find Paddy.” In February 2021, NT police offered at $250,000 reward for information that would help solve Moriarty’s suspicious disappearance. The reward is still current. In response to this, two further allegations emerged and were heard at the inquest on Wednesday. Labourer Wayne Ledwidge told the court he had overheard a conversation between his friend Brian Roberts, now deceased, and Hodgetts, in which Hodgetts offered Roberts $10,000 to “get rid of” Paddy. Hodgetts, who also gave evidence via video link from Melbourne, denied such a conversation had taken place and said she did not know Roberts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Truck driver Michael Pangquee also gave evidence that he had heard another former Larrimah resident, Richard Simpson, implicate another man in the murder, but police said there was no evidence to support this. The findings outline the life of Moriarty, who moved to Australia from Ireland at age 18, and settled in Larrimah after working on remote stations as a ringer, grader driver and station hand and competing on the rodeo circuit. The 30-page documents also charts the relationships, tensions and hardships in Larrimah, which had only 12 permanent residents when Moriarty disappeared. The case will be the final inquest for Cavanagh. “Close the door,” he told the court, after delivering the findings. “Shut the gate. Draw the blinds. Drop the curtain. Turn off the lights. It’s all over for me … my final inquest. Cheerio.”",News/Australia news,"Paddy Moriarty and his dog allegedly killed amid feud with neighbours, Northern Territory coroner finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/paddy-moriarty-and-his-dog-allegedly-killed-amid-feud-with-neighbours-northern-territory-coroner-finds
4/7/2022,"Queensland’s child protection system is failing First Nations children exposed to domestic and family violence, with some victims going through their entire childhood without receiving therapy or specialist support despite being in and out of home care, a report has found. Often it is only when a man is later recognised as a perpetrator of violence himself that he receives help for his experiences as a child, according to the New Ways for Our Families report, released on Thursday. The failures in the system are increasing young people’s interaction with the youth justice system and fuelling the intergenerational trauma that can perpetuate domestic and family violence, the report found. The research was led by the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak, with support from the Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety and Australian Catholic University’s Institute of Child Protection Studies. Researchers interviewed people working in eight community-controlled child and family services in Queensland. The research is the first step in a series of activities working to improve support for First Nations children experiencing violence. This includes giving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children a role to play in designing programs that meet their needs. The report recommends Aboriginal-controlled organisations be better resourced to drive culturally appropriate support. “To break the cycle of intergenerational trauma, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people need opportunities to heal from experiencing domestic and family violence including being heard,” said Garth Morgan, the CEO of the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Protection Peak. “Support is also needed for their families and communities to address domestic and family violence in holistic and culturally strong ways.” When a child is a victim of domestic and family violence, the main response is to remove the child from their family and community and place them in out of home care. The report said this is despite the fear of child removal being one of the greatest deterrents for First Nations women to report violence or seek assistance. Prof Daryl Higgins, the director of the ACU’s Institute of Child Protection Studies, said the problems expressed in the report are not unique to Queensland and there is an overrepresentation of First Nations children in child protection systems nationwide. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report found there are few culturally appropriate family violence services available to First Nations people. Of those that do exist, they mainly focus on adults and not on the specific needs of children and young people. In the communities the research focused on, it found that less than a quarter of domestic and family violence referrals supported First Nations families and less than 5% on average were for children or young people who were victims of domestic and family violence. In some of the areas studied, this was only 1%. The report said there are First Nations communities in Queensland that are driving successful programs to address domestic and family violence. But the report said underfunding is hampering these efforts. The 2019 National Children’s Commissioner’s Children’s Rights Report highlighted a lack of resourcing and ability to track government expenditure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people. The New Ways for Our Families report stated little has changed since then to address the funding disparity. The minister for women’s safety, Anne Ruston, said the Morrison government was developing two five-year Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander action plans, in addition to the national plan to end violence against women and children. “Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children have the greatest knowledge about the issues that affect them and we must work in genuine partnership to design programs that meet their needs,” Ruston told Australia’s National Research Organisation for Women’s Safety, which was a co-author on the report. “The [New Ways for Our Families] report will be a useful tool to help inform the Action Plan as we build on the $45m the Morrison government provided in the 2022-23 Budget for Indigenous-specific measures.”",News/Australia news,"Queensland child protection system failing Indigenous domestic violence victims, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/queensland-child-protection-system-failing-indigenous-domestic-violence-victims-report-finds
