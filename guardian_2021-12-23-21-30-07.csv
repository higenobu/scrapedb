12/23/2021,"The BBC’s chief newsreader, Huw Edwards, has revealed he has suffered bouts of depression that have left him “bedridden” during a 20-year struggle with his mental health. In a Welsh-language documentary about his career, Edwards said at times the problem has been so severe he “didn’t want to go to work” as he fought to reconcile his assured public persona with his low moods.  Edwards, 60, said his bouts of depression began in 2002, when he was presenting the Six O’Clock news, and a year before he became the presenter of the corporation’s main nightly bulletin at 10. “People tend to think that if you are confident, then you never doubt yourself. But that’s not true,” he said. “Like everyone that suffers with depression, you don’t get one bout of it. It comes and goes. For me, it started around 2002 I think. I went down fairly quickly and I couldn’t understand it.” He added: “I couldn’t get out of bed. I didn’t want to go to work. I didn’t want to speak to anybody. Maybe it was partly due to the fact that I wasn’t happy in work. I couldn’t describe how overwhelming it was. I had a bit of a scare and I had never experienced that before. “The issue was you have to maintain a public image, that is – you’re a well-known face. Whenever I had to go live on air, I would literally have to tell myself – come on now, you’ll be OK now. You just have to do it, and I just had to push myself in a way. “Eventually it did alleviate. And then, I had another bout that wasn’t quite so severe in the years after that.” Edwards is the latest prominent figure to admit to mental health problems. He said losing weight and taking up boxing had helped improve his mood. “I never understood before that there was a connection between your physical and mental health,” he said. “There’s a lot of advantages when it comes to boxing – the practice, the fitness, and there’s something else – a kind of peace of mind. “You are in some sort of a personal zone. The whole thing is about relaxing even though it is fitness.” Edwards also admitted that he was “angered” by the decision to publish the salaries of highest paid employees at the BBC. The latest figures revealed he took a pay cut from £599,000 to £529,000 last year. The documentary will broadcast on 29 December.",News/Society,Huw Edwards tells of 20-year struggle with depression,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/huw-edwards-tells-of-20-year-struggle-with-depression
12/23/2021,"Two Premier League games scheduled for Boxing Day have been called off because of Covid outbreaks at Leeds and Watford. Leeds’ game at Liverpool and Watford’s at Wolves have become the 11th and 12th top-flight matches postponed as a consequence of the virus. The affected clubs made postponement requests that were accepted by the league’s board.  The Premier League said: “The league is aware that the decision to postpone these two matches will disappoint supporters and understands their frustrations at a special time of year when fans look forward to attending and watching football games. The league aims to provide as much clarity as possible, but unfortunately postponements sometimes have to be made at short notice, as safety is the priority. The league will endeavour to keep supporters updated if games become at risk on a matchday. “The board concluded that Leeds United will not be able to fulfil their fixture this weekend due to the number of players with Covid-19, injuries and illness. The club’s training ground has also been closed after consultation with the UK Health Security Agency and the Premier League. “Watford FC continue to have an insufficient number of players to field a team after their game against Crystal Palace FC last Saturday was postponed following a Covid-19 outbreak. Due to players coming out of isolation, it is fully expected Watford will be available for their fixture on Tuesday 28 December, against West Ham United.”  More to follow",Sport/Football,Liverpool v Leeds and Wolves v Watford off on Boxing Day due to Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/liverpool-v-leeds-and-wolves-v-watford-off-on-boxing-day-due-to-covid-premier-league
12/23/2021,"Fans have reacted with dismay to the news that Coldplay will stop recording music as a band in 2025, although quiet glee was also detected among some detractors. The band’s frontman, Chris Martin, shared the “huge revelation” with the BBC Radio 2 presenter Jo Whiley on a special show to be broadcast on Friday from 7pm.  The announcement comes two months after Coldplay released their ninth studio album, Music of the Spheres, which went straight to No 1 earlier this year. “Our last proper record will come out in 2025, and after that I think we will only tour,” said Martin. “And maybe we’ll do some collaborative things but the Coldplay catalogue, as it were, finishes then.” Whiley spoke about her interview with Martin on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show on Wednesday and shared a preview clip where Martin confirmed the news. Whiley told Ball that while Martin is “disarmingly honest” in interviews, she is also “never quite sure if he’s joking or being deadly serious”. But the news is consistent with statements Martin has made previously. He told the NME in October they intended to make three more albums – to bring the total to 12 – but this is the first time he has put a date on the end point. The band’s vast following reacted with resigned sadness to the news, with a fan Thomas Rowson tweeting: “Well, we knew the day would come sometime. I guess I was just in denial and hoping it would be longer. It’s the first time they’ve put a date on it … Here’s to the last 3 albums!” But the news got a mixed reaction elsewhere, with taxi driver Martin Holmes tweeting: “Amongst all the Covid misery, there is a small glimpse of a better future.” In October, Coldplay announced a world tour with a range of initiatives designed to mitigate its environmental impact. The band have promised to cut CO2 emissions by 50% compared with their 2016-17 world tour, and almost entirely use renewable energy to power the stage show. The tour, which will start in August next year, will include a “kinetic floor” to harness energy created by fans, a stage made of renewable materials, solar panels, while battery and mains power will be drawn from renewable sources. Earlier this month Coldplay pulled out of several performances including their planned show at the Capital Jingle Bell Ball in London because of positive Covid tests in their touring party. Coldplay have been nominated for group of the year and best rock/alternative act at the 2022 Brit awards, which take place in February.",Arts/Music,Coldplay dismay fans with news they will stop recording in 2025,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/23/dismay-and-glee-as-coldplay-say-they-will-stop-recording-in-2025
12/23/2021,"Children who have arrived in the UK on their own to seek asylum are at risk of self-harm and dying by suicide, according to 25 child and migrant rights organisation, as figures reveal they are waiting longer than adults for a decision on their claim. The warning, in a letter to safeguarding institutions including the children’s commissioner and the chief social worker, said the risk was “exacerbated by Home Office failures to decide the children’s asylum claims”.  It cites an independent inspection which found that children who received a decision last year were waiting on average 550 days, or 18 months, compared with 449 days for adults. The independent chief inspector of borders and immigration said the Home Office had pledged to prioritise vulnerable, unaccompanied asylum seeking children in January 2019, but instead “found no evidence” any cases were being prioritised. It also said the Home Office had “failed to keep on top of the volume of claims it receives”. The signatories call for “urgent action” warning instead that “some of the children we support are at risk of self-harm and dying by suicide – a risk that is being exacerbated by Home Office failures to decide the children’s asylum claims”. At least 11 children who had come to the UK seeking sanctuary have been identified as having taken their own lives, many in the last year and some of whom were awaiting a decision on their claim. In the north-west of England, 80 children represented by Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU) have been waiting longer than six months for a decision on their asylum claim. Among those still waiting are nine children from Afghanistan who have on average been waiting 417 days for their asylum decision. The signatories include social workers, lawyers, and children and migrant rights charities such as GMIAU, the Children’s Society and the British Association of Social Workers. The letter states that the backlog in children’s asylum cases existed pre-Covid, but had been made worse by the pandemic when interviews by the Home Office ground to a halt in March 2020. Instead, as one solicitor said, the children he represents are quietly developing severe mental health problems because they have been left in limbo by the UK’s refugee system. Sammy, a 27-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, knows only too well the devastating impact of delays in children’s asylum claims. He arrived in the UK at the age of 15 after fleeing persecution in his home country. He travelled unaccompanied through five countries before finally reaching the UK. But once he was here he endured 13 court cases before finally being granted leave to remain 11 years later in 2020. He said the Home Office kept insisting it would be safe for him to return to Afghanistan. “I am suffering from a lot of depression and the Home Office system has not helped,” said Sammy. “I feel like I’m 60 or 70 years old rather than 25 because of everything I’ve been through. The golden years of my age have already passed. All asylum seekers and refugees who came here alone as children have mental health problems.” However, Sammy says that education and volunteering have been his salvation. He is at university studying electrical engineering and volunteers with the Red Cross helping newly arrived refugees to adapt and settle into their new surroundings. Most recently he has been visiting hotels where Afghan families who escaped the Taliban takeover of his country are staying. Parviz, also from Afghanistan, came to the UK on his own in 2015, aged 16. Six years on, the Home Office still has not made a decision on his initial asylum claim, and did not even interview him until May 2021. The 22-year-old has provided evidence of the significant impact of the delay on his mental health to the Home Office. Denise McDowell, GMIAU’s chief executive, urged the government to make urgent decisions on the asylum claims of unaccompanied young people, who she describes as being “in limbo, while their childhoods are slipping away”. “We cannot stand by while children are at risk of suicide, self-harm and exploitation because adults are failing to run the UK’s refugee system properly. How many more deaths will it take for this national scandal to get the urgent action needed to keep them safe?” she said.

12/23/2021,"Vladimir Putin has accused the west of “coming with its missiles to our doorstep” as he reiterated demands for no further Nato expansion in Europe. The Russian president did little to reduce tensions over Ukraine as he spoke at a televised press conference, saying he would be prepared to launch an intervention if he felt Ukraine or its western allies were preparing an attack on Russia’s proxies in the country.  “They keep telling us: war, war, war,” Putin said on Thursday. “There is an impression that, maybe, they are preparing for the third military operation [in Ukraine] and give us a fair warning: do not intervene, do not protect these people but if you do intervene and protect them, there will be new sanctions. Perhaps, we should prepare for that.” Analysts have said Russia may be seeking a casus belli as it stations more than 100,000 soldiers, along with tanks and artillery, within striking distance of the Ukrainian border. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, this week accused American mercenaries of transporting chemical weapons to the frontlines of the conflict zone, although he did not provide any evidence for the claim. There are few signs that Ukraine’s military is preparing an offensive in Donbass, where the frontlines have remained static for seven years. More than 14,000 people have died since fighting began in 2014. Putin said he did not want war with Ukraine but would seek new security guarantees from the west in upcoming talks with the US, reiterating his controversial demand that Nato’s eastern members remove troops and military installations that appeared after the countries’ accession to the alliance in 1997. “We have made it clear that Nato’s move to the east is unacceptable,” he said. “The United States is standing with missiles on our doorstep. Is it an excessive requirement not to install shock systems at our house? How would the Americans react if missiles were placed at the border with Canada or Mexico?” He once again expressed anger over Nato’s expansion since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, an issue that has become central to his growing antagonism with the west. “Sometimes it seems we are living in different worlds,” he said. “They said they wouldn’t expand, but they are expanding.” Putin said talks with the US should begin next year in Geneva, adding “the ball is now in their court”. He said: “American partners tell us that they are ready to launch this discussion, these talks in Geneva at the very beginning of next year. Both sides’ representatives have been appointed. I hope that the situation will unfold exactly under this scenario.”",News/World news,Putin accuses west of ‘coming with its missiles to our doorstep’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/putin-accuses-west-coming-with-missiles-doorstep
12/23/2021,"You could forgive the good burghers of Goole for being a bit put out: what chance do they have against Gibraltar? Old feuds have been dusted off and battle lines drawn, as the competition to decide which town will be awarded city status as part of the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations begins in earnest – with the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar and the Falklands included for the first time.  The competition, in which 39 places across the UK and British overseas territories will contend to become a city, is part of a series of planned celebrations to mark the Queen’s 70-year reign next year. City status is traditionally associated with having an Anglican cathedral, although this link has long since been broken and the monarch can elevate towns based on the advice of the government. Among the smaller Davids hoping to take on the Goliaths of British overseas territories and crown dependencies is Marazion, a small Cornish village outside Penzance (population 1,440) and Oban in the Scottish highlands (population 8,490). The chair of the Marazion Chamber of Commerce, Paul Elliott, said that while the picturesque nook on the shore of Mount’s Bay was a “small town”, its business welcomed more than 400,000 British and international visitors each year. The smallest city in the UK currently is St David’s in Wales, which has a population of 1,841. The mood was bullish in Goole, east Yorkshire, with a report from East Riding council declaring confidently that it had “a good case for success” even if it was taking on its unofficial twin town, Gibraltar. The humber port town is best known for its historic coal boat hoists. By contrast, Gibraltar clings to a rock off the south coast of Spain seized by the British in 1704 for strategic reasons. Some areas submitted entire council regions for consideration as cities – such as South Ayrshire in Scotland, or Medway in Kent. Medway council is applying in an attempt to correct a historic wrong. The local authority was formed in 1998 when the town of Gillingham merged with the historic city of Rochester. Unfortunately, four years later it was discovered that as part of the merger process, the council had failed to appoint trustees to protect Rochester’s historic rights – meaning its city status was irrevocably lost. Some towns applying for city status have already attempted to informally apply the label, despite not having the formal approval of the monarch. Guildford’s football club is Guildford City FC. Elgin in the north of Scotland – which already welcomes visitors with signs declaring itself to be a “historic cathedral city” – has also applied for formal recognition. Other contenders include Doncaster, South Yorkshire; Crewe, Cheshire; Livingstone, West Lothian; Ballymena, County Antrim and Dudley, West Midlands. They will be up against Stanley in the Falkland Islands, almost 8,000 miles away. There have also been entries from George Town in the Cayman Islands – and the whole of Gibraltar. In a break with past civic honours competitions, an expert panel will work closely with ministers to make their recommendations, which will then be approved by the Queen. In guidance, applicants were asked for details about “the distinct identity and community which they felt meant that their area deserved to become a city”, as well as the royal associations of their area. The new city or cities will be in addition to Southend-on-Sea, which was awarded city status by the Queen in tribute to its long-serving MP, Sir David Amess, who was fatally stabbed while holding a constituency surgery. The Cabinet Office minister, Steve Barclay, called the list a “celebration of the rich and diverse communities” including “friends” farther afield. “It’s fitting that, as we look towards celebrating the 70-year reign of Her Majesty the Queen, we extend the competition to include those parts of the world which also hold her so dearly,” he said. The full list: Alcester, Warwickshire; Ballymena, County Antrim; Bangor, County Down; Blackburn, Lancashire; Bolsover, Derbyshire; Boston, Lincolnshire; Bournemouth, Dorset; Coleraine, County Londonderry; Colchester, Essex; Crawley, West Sussex; Crewe, Cheshire; Doncaster, South Yorkshire; Dorchester, Dorset; Douglas, Isle of Man; Dudley, West Midlands; Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway; Dunfermline, Fife; Elgin, Moray; George Town, the Cayman Islands; Gibraltar, Gibraltar; Goole, east Yorkshire; Greenock, Renfrewshire; Guildford, Surrey; Livingston, West Lothian; Marazion, Cornwall; Medway, Kent; Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire; Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire; Newport and Carisbrooke, Hampshire; Northampton, Northamptonshire; Oban, Argyll and Bute; Reading, Berkshire; Peel, Isle of Man; St Andrews, Fife; Stanley, Falkland Islands; South Ayrshire, Ayrshire and Arran; Warrington, Cheshire; Warwick, Warwickshire; Wrexham, Clwyd.
