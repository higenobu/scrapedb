3/1/2022,"Police officer Zachary Rolfe did not have “reasonable” grounds to shoot Kumanjayi Walker a second and third time, and the second and third shots provided no tactical advantage in the attempted arrest of the Aboriginal man, a former Northern Territory police defensive tactics trainer told Rolfe’s murder trial before the NT supreme court. The court has previously heard Rolfe shot Walker three times during an attempted arrest on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Rolfe is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man. He has pleaded not guilty and is defending his actions on the basis they were justified in light of the risk that Walker posed to him and a colleague, then-constable Adam Eberl. Det Sr Sgt Andrew Barram, who has been an NT police officer for 25 years and completed four reports into the shooting, continued his evidence in the case on Tuesday. Barram previously had oversight of all firearms and defensive tactics training within NT police and investigated the Yuendumu incident in his role within professional standards command, the force’s internal investigations unit. He said that Rolfe had been justified in shooting Walker the first time. This shot is not subject to any charges. The court previously heard Walker stabbed Rolfe in the shoulder with a pair of scissors and then started to wrestle with Eberl while standing up, before he was shot the first time by Rolfe. Eberl has previously given evidence to the court that soon after this point he and Walker fell on to a mattress on the floor of the property and continued struggling. The prosecution said the pair were in this position, with Eberl’s body on top of Walker, when Rolfe fired the second and third shots, the court has heard. Prosecutors said the second shot was fired about 2.6 seconds after the first shot, and the third 0.5 seconds after the second. On Tuesday, Barram said these shots were not reasonable, as the situation between Eberl and Walker had changed “substantially” from when the first shot was fired. “They had gone from a standing position in a fairly equal fight, to being on the ground … and constable Eberl pinning Mr Walker down,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Barram said he made his assessments about whether the firing of all shots was reasonable only after watching body-worn camera footage of the incident in real time, but that after watching the same footage slowed down it confirmed his assessment. He said that instead of firing the second and third shots, Rolfe could have used “defensive tactics … that don’t involve a weapon” to assist Eberl in controlling Walker. Barram said Rolfe had learned such tactics as part of his police training. He said he did not think the firing of the two shots “tactically gave them any advantage”, as Rolfe was only able to help Eberl to handcuff Walker after he had placed his gun back in his holster and had the use of both hands. Rolfe’s failure to issue verbal commands when Walker presented the scissors or when he drew his weapon also went against his police training, Barram said. Under cross-examination by David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, Barram agreed that the body-worn camera footage did not show where Walker’s arm was at the time the second and third shots were fired, and that all such camera footage had limitations. He also agreed that a situation that dynamic could change in a split second, and a person under a police officer could reverse that position in an instant. Edwardson asked Barram about one of the reports he prepared which he said made clear he could not comment on how Rolfe perceived the threat posed by Walker at the time of the shooting. In the report, Barram said: “Rolfe has not provided what his apprehensions and beliefs were at the time of firing the shots, and has exercised his right to silence. Therefore I am unable to consider these mental elements in coming to an opinion about the necessity and proportionality of the force used in this situation.” Edwardson asked Barram about a video he shared about a month before the Yuendumu incident on his personal Facebook page regarding a police shooting in the US. The post had the heading, “brings a little bit of reality into the argument”, and the video itself contained a graphic that said: “Why officer shoot until threat has stopped.” Barram agreed with Edwardson that the Facebook video showed a scenario that was entirely different from that which had confronted Rolfe. Barram agreed that the video showed an offender who remained a threat as he was not incapacitated despite police shooting at him on multiple occasions. Edwardson signalled that he planned to ask Barram further questions about the Facebook post when his cross-examination continued on Wednesday.",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe trial: no ‘reasonable’ grounds for shooting Kumanjayi Walker second and third time, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/zachary-rolfe-trial-no-reasonable-grounds-for-shooting-kumanjayi-walker-second-and-third-time-court-hears
3/1/2022,"Ifirst saw Sankofa fifteen years ago, as part of a college course on the African diaspora. For years after, I would bring it up any chance I got, which wasn’t often, since in all that time, I never met anyone outside of that classroom who had even heard of it. Unlike any number of other forgotten masterpieces, the film was never that hard to track down – you could purchase a VHS or DVD copy with relative ease, and there were versions of it to stream if you knew where to look (the legality of said streams is another matter) – yet, until very recently, it remained largely unknown outside of Black academic/sociopolitical circles (who by no means should be discounted). Although it earned unanimous acclaim, as well as several awards, during its initial run on the 1993 international festival circuit, Sankofa never received widespread distribution prior to last September, when Netflix and Array, the distribution company founded by director Ava DuVernay, released a beautiful new 4K restoration of the film on the platform and in a few select theaters. Prior to that, Ethiopian-born director Haile Gerima – who emigrated to the United States in the late ’60s and became part of what would come to be known as the LA Rebellion school of black film-makers – self-distributed his movie, booking screenings at indie theaters, bookshops, libraries and colleges. Despite the academic nature of said distribution (to say nothing of my own introduction to it), watching Sankofa never feels like homework. While it is often as disturbing as you’d expect a film about the African holocaust and chattel slavery to be, its narrative arc is simply too thrilling, its mystical and emotional force too enrapturing, for it to ever devolve into what we today like to call ‘trauma porn’. The film begins with a haunting preface, in which Sankofa (Kofi Ghanaba), an African drummer caked head-to-toe in white paint, invokes the “spirit of the dead”, calling upon the ghosts of slavery – “from Brazil to Mississippi … Jamaica … the fields of Cuba … the swamps of Florida … the rice fields of South Carolina … ” – to “possess your bird of passage … rise up … step out and tell your story”. The movie properly opens in modern day, on a beachside castle off the coast of Ghana. Cast in brilliant white sunlight, we watch as both locals and tourists move about, soaking in this slice of seeming paradise. But underneath the postcard-ready idyll is a history steeped in blood. As we quickly discover, this castle was built as a fortress where the slave ships were loaded and sent off on their journey across the Middle Passage. It’s within this sacred place we meet Mona (Oyafunmike Ogunlano), an African-American fashion model using the castle as a backdrop for a sexually-charged photoshoot alongside her white photographer partner. Their disrespectful presence enrages Sankofa, the “self-appointed guardian of the castle”, so he casts a spell on Mona that puts her in a trance and sends her back in time to the days of slavery. Running through the bowels of the castle, she is beset by the risen phantoms of dozens of captive African men, even as she’s pursued by white slave traders. She cries out that she’s “not African” but to no avail. She’s quickly captured, stripped, branded and shackled in chains. Suddenly, we’re transported to a plantation in the southern United States. Mona is now Shola, a housekeeper and cook born into slavery (the disjointed nature of this psychic and temporal shift gives the film a Lynchian quality that makes it all the more confounding and compelling). Through Shola’s running narration, we get the lay of the land – the plantation belongs to the cruel Lafayette family, whose patriarch routinely rapes and beats her –and are introduced to the other characters that fill out what from here on out is an ensemble drama. The film takes its time detailing the world of the characters, but it doesn’t focus only on the routine atrocities of slavery. Instead, it gives as much attention to moments of communal joy, kinship and spiritual practice, as well with the individual desires and dreams of its characters. While Sankofa ends on a note of spiritual regeneration and redemption, at its center beats a heart of dark transcendence, the most riveting of its narrative threads belonging to Joe, whose religious mania, combined with his antagonistic relationship with his mother, mutual but unconsummated lust for a fellow slave and guilt over his daily betrayal of his people sees him descend into the type of all-consuming madness one expects from a Werner Herzog protagonist. All the while, Sankofa builds to its apocalyptic climax, one of the most cathartic sequences of violent retribution and reckoning ever committed to film. For as harrowing as it is, Sankofa is also legitimately beautiful, thanks largely to the gorgeous cinematography and bold camera work. It’s difficult to keep from comparing Gerima’s work to that of his peers – the daring formalism and constant breaking of the fourth wall, combined with the omnipresent orchestral jazz score courtesy of David J White, can’t help but make one think of Spike Lee; while the poetic voiceover and breathtaking vision of nature (which the film itself pokes some fun at via a late meta-joke about magic hour lighting) instantly recall Terrence Malick – but given that he’s been directing since the early 70s, he is owed as much credit for originality of style as any of them. At the time of film’s release, Sankofa shared more in common with literary works centered on the African Holocaust – particularly those with a magical realist bent, such as Octavia Butler’s similarly-themed Kindred and Toni Morrison’s Beloved – than the handsomely produced prestige pictures coming out of Hollywood (or, for that matter, the slavesploitation movies that played the grindhouse circuit during the 1970s). In the decades since, more movies have approached slavery from similarly speculative perspectives, including Jonathan Demme’s flawed but admirably faithful adaptation of Beloved, the wholly misbegotten horror dud Antebellum, and Barry Jenkins’ limited series adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad. But none have proven as beguiling or haunting as Sankofa. Now that it’s finally widely available, on the world’s biggest streaming platform no less, the film will likely find the audience it deserves. While it’s frustrating that it’s taken so long, it’s also fitting, given that the word Sankofa, translated from Akan Twi and Fante languages into English, means “to go back and get it.” Sankofa is available on Netflix",Arts/Film,My streaming gem: why you should watch Sankofa,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/my-streaming-gem-why-you-should-watch-sankofa
3/1/2022,"As the flood waters recede, Lismore has begun counting the cost of the devastation caused by the worst flooding in the history of the northern New South Wales town. A flotilla of 100 boats, piloted by community members, have been going street by street alongside crews from the Australian defence force and the State Emergency Service, rescuing stranded residents. One community member, who set out to check on the welfare of a neighbour, sadly discovered the elderly woman dead inside her home. It is the ninth death since the flood emergency began in south-east Queensland last week. Jaala Stott is among those searching the area by boat. She says most people who were able to leave flooded homes have now gone, and rescuers are now checking the homes of people considered to be missing. “It’s just devastation. Absolute devastation,” she says. Stott went out in an aluminium shallow-bottomed motorboat on Monday and picked up an elderly woman with Parkinsons who was “unsteady and freezing cold”, a mother and young child, and a “huge big fat dog”. The rescue efforts were coordinated via Facebook, but those requests have died down. The ADF is now attempting to coordinate local and emergency services resources to thoroughly check over the town. The SES conducted 230 rescues in the northern rivers region on Tuesday, spokesperson David Rankin says, but the ad hoc nature of the effort in Lismore means the exact number of people rescued is not yet known. The floods have taken out the electricity and phone networks, meaning many of those stranded cannot contact anyone for help. People who reported being stranded in their homes on Monday have gone silent, leaving their families frantic. Logan Madley headed out on her kayak at 7.30am on Tuesday to check on her elderly neighbours who had not been heard from since Monday. She found them sheltered in a boat behind their flooded house, reluctant to leave. The flood waters had killed their animals and destroyed their home – they wanted to stay and see what remained when the water receded. Madley gave them some supplies – panadol and non-perishable food – and caught a lift with a group of locals going by in a tinnie. They towed her kayak home. A lack of power and access is hampering efforts to reconnect the phones. “We are working with power and local authorities to access the affected areas so we can begin to restore services,” Telstra’s northern NSW regional general manager, Michael Marom, says. It’s the fourth disaster to hit the Lismore region in five years, after floods in 2017, bushfires in 2019, and the economic hit from Covid. For some, it may be the last straw. Adam Bailey owns an antique store on Woodlark Street, just 400 metres from the Wilsons River. It flooded in 2017 and again in 2020. “I can’t be insured, I’ve lost everything,” he says. “So whatever I’ve got is whatever I can save.” Bailey spent Sunday moving his antiques to the second floor, placing them above the high-water mark of 12.15 metres reached in the 1974 floods. The Wilson River peaked at 14.4 metres on Monday. “All that stuff’s disappeared,” he says. His store was still under water on Tuesday morning, despite the water dropping to 12 metres overnight. The waters are not expected to fall to below the major flood level of 9.7 metres until Tuesday afternoon, but the 10.6m high flood levee will prevent many low-lying areas from draining away. “Lismore will essentially become a bath tub, the water will be stuck behind that levee and will have to be pumped out which may take a number of days,” Rankin says. Bailey headed out on a tinnie on Tuesday morning, boating down the main street of Lismore where the water was still lapping at second-story windows, to see his business It is behind the levee, so it will be several days before enough water has been removed to assess the damage. The estimated value of his stock is more than $500,000. One piece alone was worth $50,000. “I love Lismore, the people in Lismore, the community, it’s amazing,” Bailey says. “But it’s just one of those things where you’re thinking, do we do it again? In another two years, three years, we’ll have another natural disaster and I’m back at square one.” Philip Cook was up until 4am trying to secure his furniture. He stayed back after his partner, children and their new puppy went to a friend’s house. “Everything I’ve ever owned is in that house. We’re insured for the house not the contents.” Cook and his family recently moved to Lismore from Murwillumbah, a town about 50km north on the Tweed River. They bought the house in December and were told it had never flooded. Downstream, in Ballina, the flood waters are yet to arrive. Ballina is at the mouth of the Richmond River, of which Wilsons River is a tributary. The flood waters from both catchments will drain through the town into the sea. If the river’s peak coincides with a 1.8 metre king tide, at 9am on Wednesday, the town could experience a one-in-500-year flood. The Richmond River reached its forecast peak of 6.9 metres at Woodburn at 3pm on Tuesday and was still rising. That water will take four hours to flow downstream to Ballina, arriving about the same time as the evening high tide of 1.3 metres. The water was touching the bottom of the windows at Peter McWilwain’s house in West Ballina on Tuesday morning, before draining away. He spent Tuesday afternoon trying to secure sandbags to prepare for the water to rise again that night and through Wednesday morning. The SES advised him to evacuate on foot. But with three children, two dogs, and his two elderly parents nearby, he is staying put. McWilwain has lived in the house since 1997. He’s seen floods before, including one where water lapped at his garage, but nothing like this. “Tomorrow is going to really be the worry,” he says. A short distance away, Ian Paterson surveyed the flood waters on his kayak. His family has lived in the same house in Crane Street for 80 years. The waters came within a foot of his front door on Tuesday before receding. He is hoping enough water will have drained away before high tide to avoid significant damage, but moved all his furniture into his brother’s house, one metre further off the ground, just in case. He says past flood events may no longer be a reliable guide of the areas susceptible to flooding because the significant number of new developments in the town in the past 20 years. “It has changed where the water goes,” he says. An evacuation order was issued for Ballina on Tuesday morning. The SES rescued half a dozen people who were trapped in flooded homes or who had driven into flood waters. The Ballina shire council mayor, Sharon Cadwallader, says a number of rural properties south of the town have flooded. The shire has effectively been cut off, with the airport flooded and closed to all but emergency aircraft and the Pacific Highway cut both north and south of the town due to rising flood waters. “Ballina is certainly in a terrible situation facing a one in 500-year flood but we are holding our own,” she says. “We are seeing flood levels we’ve never seen before. It is higher that the 1974 and ’54 floods.” Cadwallader asked locals not to drive boats through flooded streets for sightseeing, because the wake can push more water into homes and businesses. “There is a great community spirit out there. Offers of help are coming from everywhere and we are a resilient community and we will get through this together.”",News/Australia news,"As water laps at rooftops in Lismore, Ballina braces for its worst flood in history",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/01/as-water-laps-at-rooftops-in-lismore-ballina-braces-for-its-worst-flood-in-history
3/1/2022,"Hanya Yanagihara, author of the acclaimed Man Booker prize-nominated, million-copies-and-counting A Little Life, has been working for years on a screen adaptation. It should be the ultimate box set: epic, engrossing, “right up against the line of melodrama”, as she once described her intention. Yet it has been “pretty much rejected by everyone”, the author said in an interview at the weekend. Is it because she wanted too much editorial control, she wonders. Or because studios were looking for something more Sex and the City? If you have read it, you will be reeling, of course, at the ridiculousness: who would ever want to take control away from Yanagihara? I would put her in charge of everything. And how on earth could you Sex and the City-fy A Little Life? It would be like trying to make Titus Andronicus more like Friends. If you haven’t read it, I can’t tell you what it’s about, unfortunately: it sounds too harrowing, too much. And if that put you off, I would have ripped 10 or 15 hours of pure pleasure out of your hands for no good reason. However, for the studio execs red-lighting this, I have only sympathy. It is impossible to adapt truly popular books in a digital age. Unpopular books, difficult books, books that didn’t quite come off, those are all useful jumping-off points. Works that readers become attached to so profoundly that they walk around in T-shirts that list the main characters never get on to the screen without a massive freight of disappointment – all it takes is one guy’s hair to be not how a reader imagined it. Multiply that by a thousand details and a million readers, and you have one billion chances to screw up. Once upon a time, people would just grumble to themselves in isolation. Fifty Shades of Grey? Nobody admitted to liking it in the first place, and they sure as hell weren’t going to admit to the disappointment of the film coming out like a really long Calvin Klein ad. With A Little Life, the stakes are too huge. And nobody should even think of adapting To Paradise, her new novel, without figuring out what happens at the end.

3/1/2022,"I’m usually not picky about what I wear to go hiking, but for this walk I purposely chose a bright orange T-shirt – in case someone had to come looking for my body. I was planning to walk alone up a scrub-covered cliff face in a remote part of the Ionian island of Ithaca: locals said there was no path any more, after serious earthquake damage in the 1950s. Ithaca is known as the home of Odysseus, to which he returned after 10 years of adventures. It lies in the shadow of larger Kephalonia, which has grown rich on Captain Corelli, an airport and some fine beaches. An experienced walker of unpredictable Greek island paths (but not a rock climber), I was doing this hike for three reasons. First, I’d been employed to check all the walks in author Jane Cochrane’s latest book, Walking in the Footsteps of Odysseus. Second, in mythology, Telemachus, son of Odysseus, landed secretly at Pera Pigadi after returning from a fruitless search for his absent father and then scaled these rocks, called Korakos Petra, to meet the family’s loyal servant Eumaeus (and a mysterious visitor who turned out to be Odysseus in disguise). And third? Because they said it couldn’t be done … It was at Eumaeus’s house, on the plain atop the cliff, that Odysseus plotted how to kill the 100-plus suitors who had been bothering his wife, Penelope, for close on a decade. Jane Cochrane is a retired architect who has had a home on Ithaca since the 1980s. I knew all about her and her late husband, Alec Kazantzis, from her 2019 autobiographical book Odysseus’ Island; she knew that I’d spent a lot of 2020 following the post-Troy route of Odysseus around Greece and Italy. For her new guidebook to Ithaca, Jane aimed to lead the visitor to places associated by scholars with the words of Homer, whose descriptions in The Odyssey are so geographically accurate that she was convinced he knew the island first-hand. The plan was for us to combine forces to follow in the steps of his protagonists. Jane had no intention of risking Korakos Petra, though. “But if you want to give it a go,” she told me, “I can double back, get my car and meet you at the top!” So we hired a boat to take us out around the coast to Pera Pigadi. Landing here is tricky. Our skipper, Pierre, sailed as close as he could then, stripping to his underwear, jumped overboard and pulled the boat in as far as possible. I waded ashore after him, holding my clothes above the water. I looked up at the 250-metre white cliff towering above skirts of wild greenery and a deep, deep ravine; it was like something from The Lost World. According to legend, a hunter called Korax fell to his death here, and his grieving mother, Arethusa, hanged herself next to a nearby spring. I had no intention of joining Korax, but I didn’t know at this point how close I would come to doing so. In hi-vis T-shirt, jeans to protect my legs, and with soaked underwear tied to my stick to dry, I made my way up a footpath to Arethusa’s spring, a lovelier spot than its dark history suggested. But from there to the top there was nothing to help the hiker – definitely no path. I had planned to fill my water bottle from Arethusa’s deep natural well – but its rusted bucket leaked most of its contents before I could haul it up. After half a dozen tries I managed to get a decent amount, but another thing I didn’t know was that the bottle and I were not to be together for long. Beyond the spring, the rock wall rises like a fortification, with barely any footholds or handholds. The ravine was to my left and I had to go up and over it at its narrowest point in order to carry on to the top. As I inched my way up, I kept tossing my bottle and stick up ahead of me to leave hands free for holding on. I failed to resist the temptation to look down. Not far below were the tops of tall trees growing in the ravine; I couldn’t see how far it was to the bottom but it was a lethal-looking distance. More than once, as my fingertips held tight to almost nothing, I had that dread feeling that I was about to fall – and that before I hit the bottom, I would feel exceedingly stupid. The water bottle rolled off a ledge and past me at a moment when I was above a sheer drop and dared not free a hand to catch it. I watched it bounce in slow motion into the depths and disappear. Getting over the ravine was the most dangerous bit of the climb. After that it was tough but not life-threatening. Somewhere on the ensuing long half-walk, half-crawl through spiky undergrowth and tangled trees, I realised that my stick – and my underwear – had disappeared. I was not going back for them. Every so often, as I continued up through dense thickets, I stumbled on what looked like the remnants of paths. These would always lead in the direction I needed – but sadly didn’t last for long. I rejoiced when one of the longest and clearest bits of track started near the top and took me all the way up to the summit. I am convinced there was once a network of paths here, used by farmers going from the plain to the spring and the sea and back. A fit ancient Ithacan could have bounded up Korakos Petra in much less than the two hours 25 minutes it took me. Young Telemachus could definitely have done it. Jane firmly advises others not to follow my example; her guidebook includes a safer but longer way of exploring this area, plus a dozen other walks that we checked together. She gives maps and instructions for getting to the beach at Dexia, where Odysseus finally came ashore; up to the Cave of the Nymphs, where he hid the treasure he returned with; south across the island to the plain where his livestock grazed; to the cave where Eumaeus spent nights guarding his herd from wild dogs; all the way north to the Mycenaean remains of the Palace of Odysseus; and down from there to the Melanhydros springs whose waters Penelope and her maids might have used. Along the way her book encounters 19th-century archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann, who barked up the wrong hill in the 1870s; pioneering Sylvia Benton discovering wonderful things in the 1930s; and wife-and-husband archaeologists Litsa and Thanasis Papadopoulos excavating and finally identifying the Palace of Odysseus in 2010. Jane is the latest in a long line of Ithacan heroes … and it was an honour to be with her for this latest part of the island’s journey through history. Walking in the Footsteps of Odysseus (£9.99) can be ordered at janeocochrane.co.uk. The author will be in conversation about the book on 28 April, 6.30pm, at Paddington Library, London.

3/1/2022,"One of my favourite books of the past few years was a debut novel by an Argentinian art critic that didn’t get nearly enough attention when it was published in translation in 2019. Optic Nerve by Maria Gainza is a digressive, virtually plotless account of a woman surveying her life through the paintings that enthral her. I found it so fresh, so piercingly beautiful, I felt like I’d had a door kicked open in my mind, as Bruce Springsteen said of hearing Bob Dylan for the first time. It was clear that Gainza, like British authors Rachel Cusk and Claire-Louise Bennett, was opening up new possibilities for the novel as a place of freedom, where you could blend fiction, memoir, art history and anecdote. She immediately felt like a thrilling discovery. I was eager to read her follow-up, though mindful that doors shouldn’t really need to be kicked open twice. Portrait of an Unknown Lady, translated by Thomas Bunstead, is a seemingly more conventional novel about a high society con artist in 1960s Argentina. But like Optic Nerve, it’s a layered narrative told through impressionistic vignettes by a narrator who is attracted to the sadness and strangeness of others. From a hotel room overlooking the Recoleta cemetery in Buenos Aires, our unnamed narrator, a “fairly prestigious” Argentinian art critic, recalls how she was drawn into a world of art counterfeiting. It all began in her mid-20s, when she was appointed assistant to Enriqueta Macedo, the country’s leading authority in fine art authentication. The narrator becomes utterly devoted to the older woman – who eventually lets her in on her dirty secret. For the past 40 years, she has been giving certificates of authenticity to fake works of art. Many of these works are by the master forger, La Negra (“The Black One”), otherwise known as Renée, a charismatic, dark-skinned woman whom Enriqueta met at the Argentinian Fine Arts Academy and who has recently vanished. Back in “the golden age of art forgery”, the two women collaborated with a group of fellow art graduates and “tatty bohemians” in a run-down mansion, known as the Hotel Melancólico. They specialised in forging the Austrian-Argentine artist Mariette Lydis, known for her kitsch paintings of “murderous little girls” and “women about to turn into animals or animals not long since made human”. Enriqueta admits that though she enjoyed cheating the rich, she wasn’t in it for the money. The thrill came from the idea that Renée’s fakes were raising the bar for art. “Can a forgery not give as much pleasure as an original?” she asks. “Isn’t there a point when fakes become more authentic than originals? And anyway… isn’t the real scandal the market itself?” After Enriqueta dies, the narrator finds herself writing the auction catalogue for a suspiciously sudden discovery of “Lydis-related” objects – a pearl necklace, a dried birch branch – which collectively tell the story of the painter’s journey from Nazi-occupied Vienna to Argentina. Gainza’s novel becomes a puzzle as we question the most improbable biographical details. How much has been fabricated by the narrator? Does authenticity really matter? And exactly whose life story is she really interested in: artist, forger or authenticator? The three countercultural rebels – Lydis, Renée and Enriqueta – remain enigmas, with the narrator realising (much like Cusk) that “the idea of character, with a clearly outlined history, linear psychology and coherent way of behaving, is one of literature’s great fallacies”. She adds: “We have little and nothing: only what we are today, at a stretch what we did yesterday and, with luck, what we’re going to do tomorrow.” The narrator’s quest might be futile but it provides a way for her to keep an imaginary conversation going with her deceased mentor. And in the process, Gainza weaves a fascinating, often confounding story about beauty, obsession and authenticity. At one point, she agrees with Oscar Wilde that insincerity isn’t really so terrible a thing. “It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities. Perhaps all our sadness can be attributed to living trapped within ourselves. Perhaps it’s only the counterfeiter who finds a way past this obstacle.” Gainza clearly delights in the lives of bohemians, though tales of their giddy, romantic capers are tempered by a mordant, disenchanted narrator who put me in mind of Ottessa Moshfegh’s protagonist in My Year of Rest and Relaxation. Gainza’s fiction, however, has more in common with Roberto Bolaño’s, with themes of art and infamy, craft and theft. Like Bolaño, she writes stories within stories, each with its own melancholy mood and unsolvable mystery. I confess that I didn’t find Portrait of an Unknown Lady as enthralling as Optic Nerve, not helped by a few awkwardnesses in the translation (eg “Alfonso suddenly seemed to step off his hurtling erotic toboggan”). But this is still a novel with many beautiful, confounding moments. Maria Gainza is sharp, modern and playful, a writer who multiplies the possibilities for fiction.

3/1/2022,"Tate is facing pressure to sever ties to a Kremlin-linked Russian oligarch who has already been the target of US sanctions since 2018. Viktor Vekselberg, the founder of a Russian energy conglomerate and an associate of Vladimir Putin, is an honorary member of the prestigious Tate Foundation in recognition of past donations, the gallery has confirmed. However, as all kinds of links between Russian oligarchs and the UK come under scrutiny, the Labour MP Chris Bryant said that supporters of Putin should be “removed” from Britain’s cultural institutions. Vekselberg, who began amassing a fortune estimated to be as much as $9.3bn (£6.9bn) after Russia’s oil and aluminium industries were privatised, is among oligarchs who have invested heavily in western cultural institutions. As well as Tate, he has donated in the US to the Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall – prior to sanctions being imposed. But while he has been scrubbed from the boards of US institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his links with the Tate endure. He is listed in its most recently published annual report among its most valued supporters. The aim of the Tate Foundation is to support Tate’s growing need to fund acquisitions, exhibitions, learning, research, conservation and capital projects. Vekselberg is not sanctioned by the UK. Bryant, who is the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Russia, said: “We need to use every single sanction available to us: financial, cultural and sporting. We can’t be the generation that stood by while naked aggression stalked Europe. “Of course Putin supporters should be removed from our cultural institutions and galleries and museums should run a mile from blood-drenched Russian money.” Vekselberg has been approached for comment. The pressure on Tate came as Ragnar Kjartansson – the star Icelandic artist who had been headlining the opening of another oligarch’s gallery in Moscow, which has been the Russian establishment’s answer to the Tate Modern – told the Guardian how the invasion of Ukraine prompted him to pull the plug on his involvement. He said: “On the day of the invasion I sent them a letter saying that the day of this invasion is the last day of this performance. Usually I am swimming in a grey area but sometimes things are so obvious, ethically and morally.” Kjartansson, whose re-filming of the popular soap opera Santa Barbara was due to have been the artistic centrepiece of Moscow’s new GES-2 until 13 March, said of working in Russia: “You just feel everybody is scared. Everyone is afraid and it is all about fear.” The prestigious new arts centre, which was opened in December by Vladimir Putin, was built in a disused power station a stone’s throw from the Kremlin. It was established by one of Russia’s richest oligarchs, Leonid Mikhelson, whose V-A-C foundation has also funded Tate. His daughter, Victoria, was until recently a member of the Tate International Council, a by-invitation-only group of major international collectors and philanthropists from around the world. Mikhelson is not sanctioned by the UK. A Tate spokesperson said: “Neither of these individuals are current donors, and there are no UK sanctions on any of Tate’s supporters.”",Arts/Art and design,Tate faces call to cut ties with Russian oligarch and Putin associate,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/01/tate-faces-call-to-cut-ties-with-russian-oligarch-viktor-vekselberg-and-vladimir-putin-associate
3/1/2022,"In thousands of calendars across the length and breadth of England, 1 March will have a circle around it to mark that today is national fffer day – when children find out where they will be starting secondary school in September. Some will greet their missives from the council with relief and even joy, marking the end of an ordeal that has lasted for months or even years. For others the news will bring disappointment and perhaps a rancorous appeals process. After more than three decades of policy promoting school choice, the rituals are well-established. Every autumn, secondary schools host open days and pump out literature, wooing the next cohort of prospective students, as well as the keenest families scouting their options a year or two in advance. Parents are encouraged to do their own research, consulting league tables and inspection reports, often supplemented with a good deal of school-gate gossip. Application forms ranking between three and six schools have to be submitted by the end of October, before a four-month wait for a verdict. The dates are different, but the process is similar for primary schools.As I grew up in Scotland, all of this was alien to me before I began researching it. In Scotland, the vast majority of students go to their local catchment school by default, although around one in eight make a “placing request” for a different school. That reflects the different approach Scottish policymakers have taken, resisting marketisation where governments in England have embraced it. The English system was constructed with the best of intentions. Making schools compete for students was meant to incentivise them to up their game. Giving families more choice was meant to create empowered consumers. Yet it has not quite worked out that way. The evidence, from England and abroad, suggests such measures have had minimal impact on educational attainment and have worsened class-based segregation between schools. Far from giving people a sense of control, the process has created a maelstrom of anxiety and disenchantment. English policymakers cannot have anticipated the psychological toll of choosing a school. In interviews for my PhD research, which compares school choice in England and Scotland, English parents routinely described the experience as “stressful”, “frantic”, “a nightmare”. They spoke of being “dizzy”, overwhelmed and consumed by it. They put hours of work into it. One mum cancelled almost all her social engagements for a couple of months. Another delayed her return to full-time work until the application was in. The pressure can be extreme. Some told me about suffering sleepless nights. A mother from Poland said that picking a school felt almost as momentous as deciding to come to the UK. Perhaps the most heart-rending story I encountered was the homeless father who felt guilty that he lacked the mental energy to engage with his son’s school choice:. “It does weigh heavily on me,” he said. “Sometimes I’m just so preoccupied just getting by day-to-day that it goes in the back of my mind and niggles me.” Such feelings are amplified by social pressure – I was told by a different parent that “if you don’t put that time into it you’re not bothered about your child’s education”. While those that make placing requests could identify with some of those feelings, for most Scottish families the transition to secondary school is relatively serene. In fact, Scottish parents tended to be shocked and somewhat horrified by the English system when I described it to them. Parents on both sides of the border generally try to shield their children from worry and uncertainty, but there are clear benefits to having advance notice of where you will be going. For example, a family in Dundee described how through a series of visits they were able to gradually ease their son with autism into his new school, a process that would have to be substantially compressed in England. There are steps that could be taken to make school choice more tolerable. Policymakers could reduce some of the uncertainty around school admissions by guaranteeing each child a place at a local catchment school so that they always have a clear backstop. They could expand the number of places, especially at the most popular schools. This would reduce the proportion of students that fail to get their first choice school, currently 19% and likely to rise given a demographic bulge in the coming years, and in turn assuage families’ fears of missing out. They could bring back choice advisers, professionals whose role was to help families navigate the complexity of the process. Could the government in England go further by taking a leaf out of Scotland’s book and trying to limit school choice? Perhaps, but it will be hard to stuff the genie back in the bottle. English parents, used to the system, may resist efforts to take back their perceived rights. That said, New Zealand reintroduced catchment areas in 2000 after abolishing them for many schools in 1991, showing that school choice need not be a one-way ratchet. In any case, with such strong social norms having developed around actively choosing a school, the extent to which a change of policy would alter parents’ mindsets and approaches is uncertain.

3/1/2022,"The largest ever survey on the thoughts and behaviours of people who watch child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online has found significant evidence that those who watch illegal material are at high risk of going on to contact or abuse a child directly. Nearly half (42%) of respondents to the survey, the first of its kind, said they had sought direct contact with children through online platforms after viewing CSAM, and 58% reported feeling afraid that viewing CSAM might lead to them committing abuse in person. The report, published in the Stanford Internet Observatory’s Journal of Online Trust and Safety, is the result of months of groundbreaking research by Finnish human rights group Protect Children. Researchers placed surveys on the darknet, tagged with code words used by people searching for child sexual abuse material. About 15,000 people responded and researchers carried out detailed studies on 1,500 who replied in full to the survey. Tegan Insoll, specialist researcher at Protect Children, told the Guardian: “This is really significant. We now have a peer-reviewed study to prove that watching [CSAM] can increase the risk of contact.” The study comes as rising numbers of men are being arrested in the UK and elsewhere for watching child abuse online. “Many offenders claim that watching does not extend to harming children [directly] but we show it can increase the risk of contact and there are other factors linked to dangerous behaviour,” Insoll added. “The darker the material – for example the younger the victims – the more likely a viewer is to go on to contact a child. The same can be seen with frequency of watching this material and the age at which they were first exposed to it.” The research has already shown that a large percentage of respondents first saw child abuse material online before they were 18. “This is a massive human rights issue. Children have a right to wellbeing and health – protected from sexual violence. We are working with people around the world to use our work to show the vital importance of removing child sexual abuse material from the internet.” The UK’s only helpline for people who want to stop looking at illegal child abuse material online has reported a “monumental’’ increase in people calling. The Stop it Now! helpline supports people who are worried about their own or someone else’s sexual thoughts or behaviours towards children. New data published on Tuesday reports that 165,000 people have contacted them online or by phone during 2021, double that of the previous year. Experts at the charity say that increased isolation and job losses during the pandemic over the past two years have contributed to the rise, as have escalating porn habits. More than 2,000 people visited the Stop it Now! “get help” website after receiving a warning about their behaviour on porn sites while searching for material featuring under-18s. Donald Findlater, director of the Stop It Now! helpline said: “Many of those who contact us started out on mainstream porn sites and feel they need more extreme content. A few are struggling with a longstanding sexual interest in children and think that looking at ‘only pictures’ is a way of managing that interest. Everyone needs to know [this] is illegal and children are harmed by it.”  In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.
