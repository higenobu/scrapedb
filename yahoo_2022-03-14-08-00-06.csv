Why it matters: Finding ways around Russia's internet blockade could enable its citizens to stay connected to the rest of the world and gather information from sources beyond state-owned outlets.

Catch up quick: Virtual private networks, or VPNs, enable users to hide their locations to evade location-based restrictions and make browsing more private by encrypting internet traffic. By the numbers: Demand for VPNs surged by 1,092% in Russia on March 5, the day after Russia blocked access to Facebook, according to Top10VPN.com. Demand in Ukraine climbed 609% higher than before the invasion began, according to the site, which tracks search volume data. Downloads of eight popular VPN apps in Russia grew from 12,848 on Feb. 15 to 415,547 on March 7, according to data from Apptopia. Meanwhile, VPN providers are reporting spikes as well. Surfshark said average weekly sales in Russia have increased by 3,500% since Feb. 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine, and spiked after the country blocked Facebook and other Western media. Another provider, ExpressVPN, said traffic to its website last week from Russia increased by about 330% week over week. Likewise, traffic from Ukraine increased by about 130%. Proton said it has seen a 1,000% increase in sign ups for its VPN service in Russia this month. What they're saying: ""It’s no surprise that VPNs and other encryption tools are seeing a major uptick in sign ups right now,"" Proton founder and CEO Andy Yen said. ""For citizens in Ukraine and Russia, it’s the only thing providing a semblance of online privacy and freedom."" Between the lines: VPN use in Russia is legal, but accessing officially blocked content is not, said Simon Migliano, head of research at Top10VPN.com, who also noted there are about 15 VPN services that have been banned by Russian authorities. ""Whenever authoritarian regimes seek to control their citizens and suppress their access to information and their ability to communicate with one another, there will always be push-back,"" Migliano said in an email to Axios. Yes, but: Russia is already trying to block VPN traffic at the network level, Migliano said, and he expects that to intensify. ""This is a game of cat-and-mouse, and the best VPN services have years of hard-won experience gained in China in obfuscating their traffic,"" Migliano said. ""As a result, these VPN services are providing Russians with critical access to officially banned independent, foreign and social media, even if Russian users may have to deal with switching servers and even apps from time to time."" The big picture: Conflicts and internet crackdowns in recent years have sparked similar VPN surges in other countries, including Myanmar, Nigeria and Kazakhstan. Demand skyrocketed by 3,405% in Kazakhstan in January following an internet blackout during anti-government protests, according to Top10VPN.com. Surfshark saw a 700% increase in sales when China passed the Hong Kong national security law, but the rapid rise of downloads in Russia is unprecedented, spokesperson Gabriele Racaityte told Axios. Reality check: Journalists might be quicker to turn to VPNs to report sensitive information than everyday citizens. ""Governments count on the fact that the majority of people, either through ignorance or fear, won't defy the restrictions, thus allowing them to retain their grip on power,"" Migliano said.

3/14/2022,"(Reuters) - Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechnya region and an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Sunday that he had travelled into Ukraine to meet Chechen troops attacking Kyiv. Reuters could not independently verify whether he was in Ukraine or had travelled there during the conflict. Chechen television channel Grozny posted a video on its Telegram social media channel earlier on Sunday that showed Kadyrov in a darkened room discussing with Chechen troops a military operation they said took place 7 km (4.3 miles) from the Ukrainian capital. The post did not make clear where or when the meeting had taken place. Later Kadyrov made fun of another post that cast doubt on whether he had travelled to the Kyiv region. ""Why 'if'? Did you not see the video,"" Kadyrov wrote on his official Telegram account. Kadyrov, who has often described himself as Putin's ""foot soldier"", has posted videos of heavily armed Chechen troops in the Kyiv region as part of Russia's invasion force. He has been repeatedly accused by the United States and European Union of rights abuses, which he denies. Moscow fought two wars with separatists in Chechnya, a mainly Muslim region in southern Russia, after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union. But it has since poured huge sums of money into the region to rebuild it and given Kadyrov a large measure of autonomy. The Kremlin describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""deNazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for a war of choice.

3/14/2022,"A Ukrainian restaurant owner in New York said some staff were considering going to Ukraine to fight. Boss of Veselka, Jason Birchard, who has Ukrainian roots has also thought about joining the war. Sales have increased by up to 75%, due to customer support since the war began, he told Insider. The owner of a Ukrainian restaurant in New York said some of his employees were thinking about leaving the US to fight for their country. Out of 80 of Veselka's restaurant staff, up to 40 are Ukrainian or are of Eastern European descent, owner Jason Birchard told Insider in an interview. The day that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stopped male citizens aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country as part of a military mobilization order. Even the young staff at Veselka were willing to travel to the country and fight against Russia, Birchard said. ""I have a busboy who's 17 and he's planning on going. He's half Ukrainian-American,"" Birchard said. He added that he's trying to be supportive of his staff's wants and needs during this time. ""It's dire, a true tragedy."" Birchard, who has Ukrainian heritage, said even he has considered flying over to Ukraine to join the war. ""It's crossed my mind but I have a family here, I've got a business to run. I'm going to do my best from afar and gather support, money, and aid,"" he said. With the ""overwhelming"" support from customers and long lines outside Veselka over the past two weeks, Birchard said he's tried to hire more workers as he's been working extra hours — sometimes double shifts — to keep up with demand. Sales have soared by between 50% and 75%, and tens of thousands more customers have visited Veselka since the Ukraine war began, he said. More people are eating in the restaurant, ordering food for their offices and gatherings at home, Birchard said. ""I just wish it was under different circumstances,"" he added.

3/14/2022,"“Rust” armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed has pushed back against Alec Baldwin’s claims in legal filings that she told him to cock the gun that accidentally killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, and instead accused Baldwin of violating gun safety protocols. In a statement released Saturday by her representatives, Gutierrez-Reed said that she was never summoned by Baldwin or any producer to inspect the gun the morning of the shooting. “Hannah was not called into the Church before the impromptu gun scene rehearsal and she should have been,” the statement said, according to CNN. “Mr. Baldwin knew that he could never point a firearm at crew members under any circumstances and had a duty of safety to his fellow crew members. Yet he did point the gun at Halyna before the fatal incident against all rules and common sense,” it continued. In Baldwin’s account of the incident in legal filings filed on Friday, Baldwin restated his claim in his first public interview after the shooting back in December that he asked Hutchins if she wanted him to cock the gun while rehearsing a scene for the film and that she said yes. “Baldwin tipped the gun down somewhat so that the lens of the camera would be able to focus on his hand’s action on the top of the gun,” the filing said. “While performing this action, Baldwin asked Hutchins, ‘Am I holding it too far down?’ and ‘Do you see that?’ Hutchins responded that she could see Baldwin’s action from her angle. Baldwin then pulled back the hammer, but not far enough to actually cock the gun. When Baldwin let go of the hammer, the gun went off.” Baldwin has also insisted, both in the legal filing and in public comments, that he never checked any guns without the supervision of the armorer and that he did not believe that he or any actor should violate safety protocols by checking guns on their own. But Gutierrez-Reed disputed this, saying she met “constant resistance” from Baldwin on set. “Hannah emphasized the importance of training Mr. Baldwin in the cross draw, which is dangerous,” the statement said. “He never accepted the offer and Hannah was not able to conduct that training as well as other training she wanted to do, because of budgeting and being overruled by production.” Both Baldwin and Gutierrez-Reed are named as defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by Hutchins’ family alongside the film’s ammunition supplier, assistant director, producers and production company. A criminal investigation by the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Department is still ongoing.",U.S./The Wrap,‘Rust’ Armorer: Alec Baldwin Pointed Gun ‘Against All Rules and Common Sense’,https://news.yahoo.com/rust-armorer-alec-baldwin-pointed-204146559.html
