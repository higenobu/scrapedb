It’s disappointing, unfair, and can have a serious impact on one's career."" —Anonymous —Anonymous —Anonymous ""After teaching my sons how to drive and after they got their licenses, I then had to teach them how to handle police if they get pulled over so they are not deemed a threat and make it home alive."" —Anonymous —Anonymous —eboniw2 —bigscooby04 ""When road tripping, every Black person knows not to stop in a rural area for gas or a pee break if you can help it, especially at night. I know someone whose child actually peed their pants because the area they were driving through was a sundown town, and they weren't going to risk it."" —paigedagnew —Super_Novah ""I am a 50-year-old Black man who lives in a 98% white neighborhood. I do not go for walks alone, ever. I do not trust the level of suspicion that white residents would have regarding my presence. For example, when kids of color visit our neighborhood to do door-to-door sales, someone usually posts their presence in our neighborhood association Facebook page. So at least, I make sure I am walking my dog, or better yet, walking with my spouse."" —Anonymous —Anonymous —Anonymous —Anonymous —Anonymous —Jojo_Bunny —Anonymous —Anonymous —Anonymous —Anonymous ""Obviously, my words should be enough. If they aren’t perceived as such, my reputation and credentials certainly should be. But in the rooms I walk in, I’m often still the only woman of color, many times the only Black person, and sometimes, the only woman. Intersectionality is real. My suit somehow overrides their initial perception of who I am and what I’m there to do. I want the win, but it’s tiring to have to go above and beyond constantly just to be taken seriously."" —Anonymous —devant24 —Anonymous —Anonymous —estoricpisces Some responses have been edited for length and/or clarity.",U.S./BuzzFeed,"Black People Are Sharing The Rules They Follow That Most White People Don't Even Know About, And This Is So Important",https://news.yahoo.com/black-people-sharing-unwritten-rules-234602861.html
