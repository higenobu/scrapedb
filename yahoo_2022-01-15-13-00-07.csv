1/15/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Many people could still be infectious after 5-day quarantine After a five-day quarantine, about a third of people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, might still be infectious, according to new data. PCR tests detect virus particles but cannot tell whether they are infectious or merely inactive remnants. For a study using samples obtained from March through November 2020, researchers used a new test. In sequential samples from 176 people with positive PCR tests, they looked for genetic material that the virus produces when it is actively making copies of itself and is still transmissible. ""At five days, 30 percent of people still exhibited clinically relevant levels of potentially active virus,"" said study leader Lorna Harries of the University of Exeter Medical School in England. After a 10-day quarantine, one in 10 people might still be infectious, her team reported on Thursday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Some people retained these levels for up to 68 days, the researchers said. ""There was nothing clinically remarkable about these people, which means we wouldn't be able to predict who they are,"" Harries said in a news release. The study was conducted before the Delta and Omicron coronavirus variants began circulating last year. The researchers intend to conduct larger trials to confirm their findings. In the meantime, they suggest, in facilities ""where onward transmission would be especially problematic, it may be prudent to obtain molecular evidence of remission to prevent ongoing transmission."" Vapers risk more symptoms from COVID-19 E-cigarette users infected with the coronavirus may be more likely than infected non-vapers to experience COVID-19 symptoms, according to research published in the Journal of Primary Care & Community Health. The researchers compared 289 vapers with 1,445 people of similar age and gender who neither vaped nor smoked tobacco, all of whom had tested positive for the coronavirus on PCR tests. Compared to infected non-vapers and after accounting for participants' other risk factors, infected vapers experienced higher rates of chest pain or tightness (16% versus 10%), chills (25% versus 19%), body aches (39% versus 32%), headaches (49% versus 41%), problems with smell and taste (37% versus 30%), nausea/vomiting/abdominal pain (16% versus 10%), diarrhea (16% versus 10%) and light-headedness (16% versus 9%). ""Our research was not designed to test whether e-cigarette use increases the risk of acquiring COVID infection, but it clearly indicates that symptom burden in patients with COVID-19 who vape is greater than in those who do not vape,"" study co-author Dr. Robert Vassallo of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said in a news release. The inflammation caused by the coronavirus and the inflammation induced by vaping may combine to worsen the likelihood of inflammation throughout the body, with a resulting increase in symptoms, Vassallo and his colleagues suggested. Experimental drug targets COVID-19 from two angles An experimental drug originally being developed to treat influenza is showing promise against SARS-CoV-2 and might defend against COVID-19 from two different directions, researchers said. The drug, called zapnometinib or ATR-002, could potentially curb the proliferation of the virus in cells and also reduce the exaggerated immune response that contributes to critical illness in severe cases of COVID-19, test tube experiments indicated. The data, published on Thursday in the journal Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, provided the basis on which the German Institute of Drugs and Medicinal Products gave manufacturer Atriva Therapeutics its approval for the drug to be tested in people. This marks the first time any drug has been shown to have a dual action against COVID-19, study co-author Stephan Ludwig of the University of Muenster said in a news release. ""Positive results from the still-ongoing clinical study in humans might already lead to an emergency approval this year,"" Ludwig said.

1/15/2022,"Crossing your legs while you're sitting is a comfortable position for many of us, but you may have heard that crossing your legs isn't the healthiest position for your body. And I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's true: crossing your legs for long periods of time isn't good for your body in a few ways. In fact, I can personally attest to this. I started feeling persistent pain in my hips last year, which stuck around for so long I eventually started seeing a physical therapist. What I had thought was just a hip strain ended up being several related problems: a weak core, weak glutes, and a slightly tilted pelvis that was causing pain in my hips as well as my lower back. The core and glute strength I knew I could work on, and my PT gave me a workout I started doing religiously - but I'd never even heard of a pelvis getting ""tilted"" before. And my physical therapist said that one thing that causes and exacerbates this problem is (yep, you guessed it) crossing your legs for long periods of time, which I, of course, have been doing for years. (Especially while working from home.) So why is crossing your legs a bad sitting position, and how should you sit instead? Uncross those legs and let's get into it. Related: These Workout Moves Can Actually Support Your Immune Health Sitting with your legs crossed at the knee can create a few different issues for your posture, related to muscles, joints, and your bones. Here are a few potential problems: Crossing your legs can lead to pelvic tilt. A 2014 study found that sitting with crossed legs for three or more hours per day can cause lateral pelvic tilt, meaning that one hip will be higher than the other. The researchers explained that this position stretches the hip abductor muscles in your top leg and weakens your gluteus medius, one of the muscles on the side of your hip. When that muscle gets weak, it can allow your pelvis to shift out of place. Crossing your legs can cause spinal problems. When your legs are crossed at the knee, your range of hip flexion is lessened, and your body may compensate by forcing your lower back to bend. If you hold this position habitually, it can actually lead to scoliosis (when your spine curves sideways), which can lead to pain and muscle and joint issues. Crossing your legs can cause shoulder tilt. When you sit with your legs crossed, it typically shifts your upper body to one side. In the 2014 study, researchers noted that people who often sat with their legs crossed for three hours or more had ""significantly"" inclined shoulders, meaning that one shoulder was higher than the other. Crossing your legs can push your head forward and cause neck pain. The 2014 study also noted that the lower back bend caused by crossing your legs for three hours or more can also affect the position of your head, causing you to push it farther forward. This position can lead to neck pain and general muscle imbalances. Crossing your legs while seated can also cause a temporary spike in blood pressure, which one 2010 study called a ""significant"" increase over patients' baseline blood pressure. This is the reason why healthcare professionals ask that you set your feet flat on the ground before measuring your blood pressure. It's important to note that this spike is temporary, but it still may be worth avoiding the crossed-legs position for long periods of time if you already have high blood pressure. Related: I Did 7 Minutes of Hip Stretches Every Day; After 2 Weeks, My Body Felt Completely Different There are plenty of ways to improve your posture, but when it comes to what to do with your legs, specifically, it's typically recommended to sit with your feet flat on the ground as much as possible. (You can place a stool or box under your feet if they don't touch.) My physical therapist also told me that sitting with my feet crossed at the ankle is OK - not as good as feet flat on the ground, but better than legs crossed at the knee. (She said sitting criss-cross is also acceptable, but I tend to slouch in that position.) It's a hard habit to break, I'll be the first to admit. I often found myself shifting to one side, ready to cross one leg over, and had to force myself to set it back down and sit with my feet flat again. It's been about a year now, and I definitely sit with my ankles crossed more frequently now. If I feel like I need to change my leg position, I'll stand up for a second or walk around for a bit. It's not easy, but my pelvis is back in place after a few months of physical therapy and at-home exercises, and I'm not about to jeopardize that again. So if you love to sit with your legs crossed, take it from me: it won't cause you serious harm, but it can definitely lead to some issues, especially with your posture, that you'd rather avoid. Set your feet flat on the floor and thank me later.",Health/POPSUGAR,A Physical Therapist Told Me to Stop Crossing My Legs - Here's What I Do Instead,https://news.yahoo.com/physical-therapist-told-stop-crossing-232946751.html
1/15/2022,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has finalised a deal to acquire a shore-based anti-ship missile system from India for nearly $375 million to beef up its navy, the Southeast Asian nation's defence minister said. The Philippines is in the late stages of a five-year, 300 billion pesos ($5.85 billion) project to modernise its military's outdated hardware that includes warships from World War Two and helicopters used by the United States in the Vietnam War. Under the deal negotiated with the government of India, Brahmos Aerospace Private Ltd will deliver three batteries, train operators and maintainers, and provide logistics support, Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said in a Facebook post late on Friday. It was conceptualised in 2017, but faced delays in budget allocation and due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new anti-ship system aims to deter foreign vessels from encroaching on the country's 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. In 2018, the Philippines bought Israeli-made Spike ER missiles, its first-ever ship-borne missile systems for maritime deterrence. Despite friendlier ties between China and the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte, Beijing has remained adamant in claiming large portions of the South China Sea, a conduit for goods in excess of $3.4 trillion every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have lodged competing claims. A 2016 international arbitration ruling, however, said the Chinese claims had no legal basis.
