2/2/2022,"Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) will report its Q4 earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday. The search giant will likely face fewer headwinds in the online advertising space than social media platforms like Facebook (FB) and Snapchat (SNAP), which have been slammed by changes to Apple’s (AAPL) iOS privacy settings. Here’s what Wall Street is expecting of the company in the quarter, as compiled by Bloomberg, compared to its performance in the same quarter last year. Revenue ex-TAC [minus traffic acquisition costs]: $59.3 billion expected versus $46.4 billion in Q4 last year. Earnings per share: $30.01 expected versus $22.30 in Q4 last year. Investors and analysts will pay close attention to the performance of Alphabet’s advertising business, which is its chief revenue driver, as well as its up-and-coming cloud business. While privacy changes Apple made to its iOS platform have dinged advertisers including Snap and Facebook parent Meta, Google is less affected by the new policy thanks to the sheer amount of data it collects via its own search and YouTube offerings. Apple’s privacy changes primarily impact apps that collect user data as they traverse the web. But since Alphabet can pull data directly from user search results, it isn’t as exposed to Apple’s moves. “Our industry checks suggest Search outpaced Social in the quarter, [with] Search perhaps benefiting from some shift of ad dollars related to iOS changes, even against the backdrop of mixed ecomm/retail spending,” J.P. Morgan’s Doug Anmuth wrote in an analyst note ahead of Alphabet’s earnings. Google Cloud growth will also be in the spotlight, as Alphabet continues to plow money into the platform in an effort to steal market share away from Amazon’s AWS and Microsoft’s Azure cloud services. Anmuth predicts that Google Cloud will report losses of $705 million, about $60 million less than the company’s third quarter earnings report. “Cloud remains a long-term growth opportunity & heavy investment area for [Google],” he said. While tech sector stocks have been especially volatile lately, shares of Alphabet have easily out-performed competitors’ stocks. As of mid-day Monday, shares of Alphabet were up more than 46% in the last 12 months. That easily outstrips the broader S&P 500, which was up 19%. Shares of Microsoft, one of Alphabet’s biggest cloud rivals, were up 32%, while shares of Amazon were down 7.5%. Shares of Facebook — Alphabet’s largest competitor in the online advertising business — were up 20%.

2/2/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. shares declined after the telecommunications giant said it will pay a dividend at the lower end of its previously announced range following the spinoff of its WarnerMedia business to Discovery Inc.

That translates to about $1.11 a share, or $8 billion annually. AT&T had originally planned to pay a ratio of 40% to 43%, or as much as $9 billion. Prior to the deal AT&T’s dividend was $2.08 a share, or about $15 billion. The company’s shares fell 4.8% to $24.32 and Discovery was down 6% at 9:37 a.m. in New York. With the planned payout, AT&T emphasized, its dividend yield will still be among the highest among U.S. companies, in the mid-90th percentile. The combination will create one of the world’s largest media companies with movie studios, premium programming including HBO, live broadcasts of sports and news and a library of TV shows and films to rival online giants Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co.’s Disney+. Tuesday’s filing also spells out the structure that AT&T decided to use for the transaction, opting for a spinoff instead of a split-off. A spinoff is a simpler exchange of AT&T shares for a stake in Warner Bros. Discovery. A split-off would have given AT&T shareholders an option to take stock of the new company or sell shares back to AT&T. To avoid the risks and complications, the company opted for the spinoff, with AT&T shareholders to receive about 0.24 share of the new company for each of their shares. In the transaction, AT&T will get $43 billion worth of cash and debt considerations. The company expects to close the deal in the second quarter. AT&T shareholders will get stock representing 71% of the new company, which is called Warner Bros. Discovery and will list on the Nasdaq. Discovery shareholders will have 29% of the company. AT&T acquired the assets when it purchased Time Warner Inc. for $85 billion in 2018. After facing challenges trying to integrate the media division and several management restructurings, AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey decided to change course on the strategy and focus on the company’s connectivity business. AT&T says it will use the proceeds of the transaction to invest in areas like 5G and fiber network expansion. It will also have cash on hand to pay down debt. The company is targeting a leverage ratio of 2.5 times by the end of 2023.
