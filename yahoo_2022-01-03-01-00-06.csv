1/3/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal Twitter account has been suspended, per a statement from Twitter. Twitter said that it was suspending Greene ""for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy."" Greene has been a magnet for controversy since her election to the House in 2020. Twitter has suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal account for spreading COVID-19 misinformation. ""We permanently suspended Marjorie Taylor Greene for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy,"" Twitter said in a statement, as first reported by CNN's Donie O'Sullivan. ""We've been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy."" â€”Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) January 2, 2022 The official representative account for Greene, a freshman Republican from Georgia, remains active on Twitter. Greene responded to Twitter's decision on GETTR, the conservative social media platform launched by Jason Miller, who was the chief spokesman for former President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and a senior advisor for the former president's 2020 campaign. ""When Maxine Waters can go to the streets and threaten violence on Twitter, Kamala and Ilhan can bail out rioters on Twitter, and Chief spokesman for terrorist IRGC can tweet mourning Soleimani but I get suspended for tweeting VAERS statistics, Twitter is an enemy to America and can't handle the truth. That's fine, I'll show America we don't need them and it's time to defeat our enemies,"" Greene wrote. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California has repeatedly been the target of criticism by conservatives for comments from 2018 where she encouraged people to ""push back"" on members of the Trump administration in public and ""tell them they're not welcome anymore."" Greene also made an unsubstantiated connection concerning Vice President Kamala Harris and Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and their support of the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a nonprofit organization that assists low-income individuals who need money for bail. Some conservatives have equated support of the Fund to a desire to bail out rioters who destroyed property after the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis last year. Since her election to the House, Greene has been become one of the most polarizing politicians on Capitol Hill, reveling in the sort of partisan combat that defined the Trump presidency. Last February, only weeks after assuming office, Greene was stripped of her committee assignments, an extraordinary move taken by the Democratic-controlled House after the congresswoman promoted a range of conspiracy theories and endorsed political violence on social media. She has continued to attract attention for her extreme rhetoric and antics; a confrontation that Greene initiated with Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri led the Democratic congresswoman to switch Capitol Hill offices to escape the immediate orbit the Georgia Republican. In May, Greene compared mask mandates to the Holocaust and apologized for her comments the next month, but then compared President Joe Biden's calls to vaccinate Americans against the coronavirus to the Nazi regime. ""Biden pushing a vaccine that is NOT FDA approved shows covid is a political tool used to control people,"" she tweeted in July. ""People have a choice, they don't need your medical brown shirts showing up at their door ordering vaccinations. You can't force people to be part of the human experiment."" Since the congresswoman made her aforementioned statement, the Food and Drug Administration has issued full approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Last month, The New York Times reported that Greene and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia were collectively fined over $100,000 for refusing to adhere to the House's mask rules set by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California. This story has been updated.

""This has been one of the most traumatizing experiences in my life and in the lives of my colleagues,"" said Wheatland Union High School District Superintendent Nicole Newman on in a video shared to Facebook on Thursday. She and her colleagues have also received ""threats that are aimed against our families,"" Newman added in the video. The photo, showing eight white students with thick, black swastikas painted onto their torsos, went viral on social media. The students, some of whom are holding alcoholic beverages, appear to be at a house party. The students attend Wheatland Union High School, Newman confirmed. ""When I first saw them, I was profoundly disturbed and heartbroken. I knew just how much pain these images were going to cause our community,"" Newman said. The students have been disciplined, according to the Sacramento Bee. But details of the consequences they are expected to face were not publicly shared for legal reasons. Newman said the video message posted on Thursday would be the last public update on the case ""as we cannot legally go into detail regarding the discipline of these students."" ""There is no denying that, the choices made by the students in the picture were hurtful and deeply troubling. Their actions do not represent who we are as a school district and community,"" Newman said in a separate statement on December 23. Newman said she'd reach out to elected officials and ""key community stakeholders"" to ""begin the process of having a broader community conversation about how we can work together to prevent this type of issue from ever happening again.""
