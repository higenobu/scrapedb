3/21/2022,"Rishi Sunak is being urged to boost aid UK spending in this week’s mini-budget after an in-depth study by a leading thinktank showed government cuts had the biggest negative impact on the world’s poorest countries. The campaign group One said the aid budget was at “breaking point” and would come under renewed pressure as a result of humanitarian and refugee spending in response to the war in Ukraine. One’s UK director, Romilly Greenhill, called on the chancellor to use his spring statement on Wednesday to accelerate the return to Britain spending 0.7% of national income on overseas assistance. A study from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research thinktank – commissioned by One – concluded the £4bn aid cut had implications both for the UK and recipient nations. “The recent cuts in UK aid provide negligible direct savings for the UK, come at a cost to the UK economy, and poses significant humanitarian and social costs in many poor countries,” the NIESR report said. Sunak announced a reduction of aid spending to 0.5% of national income in November 2020 when the Treasury was faced with the mounting cost of the Covid-19 pandemic, but in the following year’s budget pledged a return to 0.7% by the end of the parliament provided certain conditions were met. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to report on Wednesday that the government finances are in a healthier state than thought at the time of last October’s budget, giving the chancellor some extra spending power. NIESR said aid delivered good value for money, helping recipient nations financially but also raising UK national output. It said cutting overseas assistance had cost the UK between £322m and £423m in lost exports. “The chancellor argued that the aid cut is required on fiscal grounds. This paper, however, argues that restoring the aid budget would not worsen the fiscal position in the UK significantly, and could actually support the UK exports whilst also supporting the livelihoods and food security of many poor people in many developing countries.” Greenhill said: “We’re in a different world to when the aid budget was first cut. Since the chancellor announced the cut in 2020, circumstances have changed, and the justification that was used then no longer holds. “The government cannot deliver on its own agenda at the current budget, and with more and more spend being added, UK aid is being stretched to breaking point. It’s pushing existing anti-poverty work out.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK has a long history of helping others in their hour of need and we are one of the largest aid spenders globally, above the OECD average. “We will continue to help protect people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine and have already provided £220m in aid, including for life-saving medical supplies, shelter and hygiene kits, and pledging £25m for the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal, as part of our largest-ever aid match contribution.” Separate research by One into the impact of the war in Ukraine on the rest of the world showed rising food and fuel prices and increasingly fragile supply chains risked pushing millions of people into extreme poverty, destabilising parts of the African continent and leading to new geopolitical alliances. “Conflict in Ukraine is already pushing up wheat prices, which in turn hits those in Africa facing food insecurity the hardest, all while many of these people are having essential nutrition programmes cut,” Greenhill said. “It’s absolutely the case that people fleeing violence in Ukraine need to be supported and people facing famine in east Africa need to be supported. But by keeping our aid budget unnecessarily reduced, the UK is not in a position to do both, it’s forcing itself into a situation where it has to choose between people in crisis.” The NIESR report said aid cuts had fallen heavily on sub-Saharan Africa. Up to 1.5 million people in the region may remain malnourished as a result, it concluded.",News/Global development,Rishi Sunak urged to restore UK aid spending after Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/20/rishi-sunak-urged-to-restore-uk-aid-spending-after-ukraine-invasion
3/21/2022,"Forest experts and scientists are asking Nasa to extend the life of a “key” climate and biodiversity sensor due to be destroyed in the Earth’s atmosphere early next year. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (Gedi) mission – pronounced like Jedi in Star Wars – was launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to the International Space Station (ISS) in December 2018, and has provided the first 3D map of the world’s forests. Data from the Nasa mission, which has used billions of laser beam signals to measure the height, shape and health of the Earth’s trees since April 2019, has been helping scientists answer questions about land-use change, a key driver of the climate crisis and biodiversity loss, including how much carbon trees store and the effect of forest fires on the atmosphere. The $150m project is scheduled to be “de-orbited” from the ISS early next year and the sensor – roughly the size of a fridge – will be incinerated in the Earth’s atmosphere. Researchers overseeing the project, based at the University of Maryland, have asked for an extension to allow Gedi to finish its work and calibrate the results with other satellites due to launch this decade that will monitor the planet’s ecosystems. Early results from the project indicate there could be much more carbon stored on land than previously thought. While they acknowledge Gedi’s lifetime has already been extended once, in March 2021, the researchers say extensions on the ISS are common and the tool is providing crucial data, including helping to monitor the Cop26 commitment from 142 countries to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. “The biggest uncertainty we have in terms of atmospheric CO2 concentrations driving climate change is the balance between deforestation and subsequent regrowth. Gedi is helping us address that,” said Prof Ralph Dubayah, principal investigator on the mission. “If you want to plant a trillion trees, go ahead. But you have to know what you’re starting with to know what kind of impact that’s going to have.” Leading forest experts have backed calls for a stay of execution. They called the sensor a “key tool” for understanding global heating and described its pending destruction as a waste of money. When contacted by the Guardian, Nasa said Gedi has already been extended beyond its prime mission to allow for additional data collection and is scheduled to be replaced by another sensor early next year. Although scientists know the planet’s trees are an enormous carbon store holding the equivalent of nearly a century’s worth of annual fossil fuel emissions at the current rate, basic questions about the size and structure of forests remain unanswered. The uncertainty poses difficulties for researchers tracking emissions from land-use change. “Considering that we have to accelerate climate action, and forests are something we can use for mitigation, it is critical that Gedi meets its scientific goals,” said Laura Duncanson, a research scientist on the Gedi team. Inge Jonckheere, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) author and head of remote sensing and climate change at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, said: “Every country can come up with its own definition of a forest. Countries can just fill in numbers and then everybody has to take them as the truth. But with satellites, we can check them,” said Jonckheere. Fred Stolle, deputy director of the forest programme at the World Resource Institute, said his organisation was adding Gedi data to its Global Forest Watch platform, one of the primary free sources of reliable information about the world’s forests. “Currently, our main tool is tree cover from the Landsat programme. But now we are shifting to tree height because it is a better indicator of forest health using Gedi,” he said. “The data allows us to find important areas of forest and say: do not touch this.” Diego Saez Gil, head of Pachama, a carbon offsetting firm that uses AI and remote sensing to verify and monitor carbon capture by forests, said Gedi provided “the best available data to estimate the carbon stored in forests”. “The longer Gedi stays in orbit, the more spatial coverage we can get, improving the quality of biomass estimates. If Gedi were to remain in orbit, we could have long-term continuous records of biomass.” Matthew Hansen, a remote sensing scientist whose data is used as the scientific standard in deforestation research, said the combination of GEDI and other Nasa land monitoring enabled researchers to “assess deforestation and associated emissions, as well as restoration efforts”.

So a lockdown collaboration where the Libertines frontman writes the words and French composer Frédéric Lo handles the music seems a timely idea. However, as our belletrist declaims on lead single The Epidemiologist, “the best-laid plans can oft go to fuckery”. Doherty’s weak, watery quiver of a voice is over-exposed on Lo’s parodic pop fantasias, which veer from syrupy and insincere fluff to low-stakes Smiths tributes. On The Ballad of… they find a witty tension between soft shoe music and steel-toecap subject matter, and Far from the Madding Crowd is an agreeable lament, but it all feels very inconsequential and hackneyed. Sometimes we’re in France, sometimes Margate, but wherever this wide-eyed chansonnier roams, his say-what-you-see lyrics retreat into lists of unexplored references (“Jean Seberg, Daniel Darc / Panic in the streets and panic in Needle Park”) interspersed with complaints about the burdens of songwriting.

3/21/2022,"Eleven Ukrainian political parties have been suspended because of their links with Russia, according to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The country’s national security and defence council took the decision to ban the parties from any political activity. Most of the parties affected were small, but one of them, the Opposition Platform for Life, has 44 seats in the 450-seat Ukrainian parliament. “The activities of those politicians aimed at division or collusion will not succeed, but will receive a harsh response,” Zelenskiy said, in a video address on Sunday. “Therefore, the national security and defence council decided, given the full-scale war unleashed by Russia, and the political ties that a number of political structures have with this state, to suspend any activity of a number of political parties for the period of martial law,” the Ukrainian leader added. The Opposition Platform for Life, Ukraine’s biggest opposition party, is led by Viktor Medvedchuk, a pro-Moscow oligarch with close ties to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Party officials later said the suspension “had no legal basis”. The Ukrainian authorities last year charged Medvedchuk, a longtime ally of Putin who is believed to be the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter, with treason and placed the oligarch under house arrest, a move that angered the Kremlin. Ukraine said Medvedchuk escaped house arrest three days after Russia started its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February and his whereabouts are currently unknown. The list of parties banned on Sunday also included the Nashi (Ours) party led by Yevhen Murayev, as well as a number of smaller parties not represented in the parliament. Prior to the start of the war, unspecified British intelligence claimed that Russia was considering installing Murayev to lead a Kremlin-controlled puppet government in Kyiv, claims that Murayev strongly denied. Ukraine’s decision to suspend a number of parties was slammed by senior Russian officials on Sunday, with the chair of the Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin, saying “it was another mistake” made by Zelenskiy that will “divide the country”, while ex-president and top security official Dmitry Medvedev sarcastically wrote that the move would bring Ukraine closer to the west. “The most democratic president of modern Ukraine has taken another step towards the western ideals of democracy. By decision of the Council for National Defence and Security, he completely banned any activity of opposition parties in Ukraine. They are not needed! Well done! Keep it up,” Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel. The political move comes as Zelenskiy aims to further assert his influence over the country’s media sphere. On Sunday, the Ukrainian leader signed a decree that aims to unite all national TV channels into one platform, citing the importance of a “unified information policy” under martial law.",News/World news,Ukraine suspends 11 political parties with links to Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/20/ukraine-suspends-11-political-parties-with-links-to-russia
3/21/2022,"On a soft, spring-like south London afternoon Crystal Palace produced a performance of thrust, energy and refined attacking interplay to surge on into an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Stadium. It helped that they were pitched against an Everton team that seemed to have no real idea how they wanted to play, and none of the rage and resilience required to respond once they fell behind. Not to mention no further answer as Palace scored twice in each half. By the end the 4-0 scoreline looked a little kind to the visitors. This was the first time Patrick Vieira had started his entire hand of attacking players – Patrick’s Pups (age range: 21 to 29) – in the same game. It has been a theme of the last few months around this place: a team that survived in the top tier by smothering and keeping the centre solid have the weapons to play an entirely different game now. The third goal on 78 minutes seemed to sum up that fluency, finished off by Wilfried Zaha after Michael Olise’s shot had hit a post, both men alone in the Selhurst sunshine as the white shirts stood and watched, and greeted by another barrelling cheer from a basking home crowd. The contrast will have been stark for Everton supporters, on a day when their team began with a surge of intent but congealed as soon as the day turned against them. Here was an opposition with a clear set of attacking patterns, with players who were obviously delighted to be out there discovering the deeper gears in this new-build midfield and attack. So this is what team building looks like. Selhurst Park had been a breezy, chilly place at kick-off, the air thick with flare smoke, the supersized away end already on its feet. Vieira had made two changes from the 0-0 draw with Manchester City, Jack Butland replacing Vicente Guaita in goal and Eberechi Eze given another opportunity to find his feet after a season ravaged by injury. Even on paper that front five of Gallagher-Eze-Olise-Mateta-Zaha looked like a mouthwatering blend of energy and movement, a Palace team now fully evolved beyond the deep double block of the Hodgson era. Frank Lampard had reinstalled Jordan Pickford after illness and brought in André Gomes, Jonjoe Kenny and Andros Townsend. Everton dominated the game early on. With a minute gone Micheal Keane found himself alone in front of goal but snatched his shot wide. Richarlison, who chose to play here rather than return home after the death of his grandmother, ballooned the ball over the bar from a decent position. For a while Anthony Gordon did Anthony Gordon things, sniping into space and passing accurately, a footballer with a precious kind of optimism about his game. With 17 minutes gone Townsend left the field with a wrenched knee. At which point, with Palace still to mount a serious attack, the game turned completely. First Eze mustered up a shot on the turn after some neat interplay with Olise. Then on 25 minutes Olise produced a lovely, shark-like burst down the right to win a corner. His first kick, viciously whipped in, was palmed over by Pickford. The second on the same angle but better placed was flicked into the net by the head of Marc Guéhi. This was a finish of real skill, not just reading the line of the ball but directing it with perfect timing though a crowd of players. It was a lovely goal for other reasons, made and scored by two brilliant young footballers who, given the time, really do have the talent to take this team wherever they want to go. For a while Everton were limited to scrappy, off the cuff breakaway attacks, Gomes and Abdoulaye Doucouré unable to find any kind of rhythm in midfield as Palace pressed with energy and the game became a little messy. And on 41 minutes it was 2-0. Eze carried the ball forward on the left then nudged the perfect pass on to Zaha. His low cross found Jean-Philippe Mateta. The finish was low and hard past Pickford, who flopped to the ground but couldn’t get a hand on the ball. By now Everton looked baffled, frozen, bemused by the apparently unforeseen possibility of going a goal behind, of finding opponents with ideas and energy of their own. Lampard sent on Dominic Calvert-Lewin for the second half, Demarai Gray having already replaced Townsend in a new-look front three. But part of the beauty of Palace’s high-craft front six is the ability of those players to manoeuvre the ball, to retain possession by being smarter and quicker in their footwork and their passing. Olise continued to glide infield from the right, eventually drawing a booking for desperate-looking Mason Holgate, who really couldn’t cope with his movement. Connor Gallagher pressed like a dervish. Zaha, who must be having the time of his life right now, looking back at those years when he was The Only Guy, was a source of high-grade menace down the left. With three minutes to play Will Hughes added a fourth as Palace besieged the Everton goal with an easy, almost sadistic air of pleasure, smashing the ball past Pickford after Gallagher’s shot had been saved. Palace have a great deal to look forward to from here. For Everton this was the bleakest of away days, and an ominous looking signpost for the remainder of the Premier League season.",Sport/Football,Guéhi and Mateta lead Crystal Palace to FA Cup semi-finals with rout of Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/20/crystal-palace-everton-fa-cup-match-report
