5/13/2022,"Even as the Democrats’ feeble legislative attempt to codify federal protections for abortion rights goes down in flames, many Washington elites are directing their attention and anger towards the same target: no, not rightwing judges reaching their ideological hands into millions of people’s bodies, but instead the protesters peacefully demonstrating outside the homes of supreme court justices who are about to overturn Roe v Wade. Prominent Republican lawmakers, conservative operatives and Beltway pundits are demanding the government arrest demonstrators – and to do so, they are citing a McCarthy-era statute passed to stop people from protesting against the prosecutions of alleged communists. Ignored in the discourse is a past ruling from the supreme court effectively blessing conservative protests at the homes of abortion clinic workers. The largely manufactured outrage is the latest distraction designed to shift attention away from the issue at hand: the US supreme court’s conservative supermajority is about to deny basic reproductive rights to tens of millions of people in roughly half the country. Conservative operatives want Washington reporters focused on inane questions like who leaked the court’s draft opinion, and they want journalists and Democrats to criticize protesters who are outraged by the court’s overriding lack of respect for people’s bodily autonomy. It is part of a larger rightwing movement in recent years to cancel, criminalize and literally crush dissent throughout the country, even as the conservative political noise machine continues to blare Braveheart-esque screams of “freedom!” against so-called “cancel culture”. Corporate news outlets are taking the bait, fretting about the leak and calling for arrests over peaceful demonstrations. Like usual, they are focused on narrow flashpoints of anger and upheaval that will likely prove temporary, rather than the far more sweeping and ominous impact of the court’s looming ruling to overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision and allow states to force people to carry their pregnancies to term. Even as the nation is poised to enact an injustice of historic proportions, those in power and their chosen mouthpieces only appear to care about one thing: upholding the rights and privileges of the ruling class, and ensuring they remain safely ensconced in the Washington bubble. To his credit, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, issued the most rational statement of all: saying, “My house – there’s protests three, four times a week outside my house. The American way to peacefully protest is OK.” But he has been drowned out by the noise machine demanding a crackdown. The hypocrisy is particularly powerful among liberals like the Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin of Illinois. He purports to support the pro-choice movement but he has spent his decades atop the Washington power structure failing to secure reproductive rights, and this week he has spent his time using his platform to deride the court protesters, calling them “reprehensible”. Durbin’s behavior – emblematic of so many liberals and media elites – evokes the warning of Martin Luther King. “I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate,” King wrote in 1963 amid the civil rights struggle of his era. “The white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says, ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can’t agree with your methods of direct action.’” Justice Samuel Alito authored the draft opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization that was leaked to Politico last week. In the opinion, Alito writes the Roe decision “was egregiously wrong from the start” and finds that the constitution “does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion”. The opinion adds that “​​we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public’s reaction to our work,” as if to hammer home the conservatives justices’ contempt for the people whose lives they are seeking to upend. Despite the court’s supposed lack of concern about what the public thinks, tall fences were quickly erected around the supreme court building. In recent days, protesters have gathered outside the homes of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Alito to register their opposition. There’s no evidence that the protests have been violent, and Congress is already fast-tracking legislation to allow the supreme court’s police force to provide security for justices’ families. Notably, the bipartisan bill includes no additional security protections for people who go to abortion facilities amid credible threats of violence. But still, conservatives and elite pundits are calling for a major crackdown against dissent, pitting themselves against a first amendment that explicitly states the government may not pass any law “abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances”. The right’s weapon of choice is a law passed during the Red Scare hysteria of the 1950s. Senator Josh Hawley wrote a letter to the attorney general, Merrick Garland, on Tuesday demanding the DoJ “vigorously investigate and prosecute” those protesting at supreme court justices’ homes. “Federal law makes it a crime for a person, ‘with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty’, to ‘picket[] or parade[] … in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge’”, Hawley wrote, adding: “The First Amendment is no shield to this illegal conduct.” The Washington Post editorial board agreed with this premise, writing a column on Monday arguing that it is crucial to “protect robust demonstrations of political dissent while preventing them from turning into harassment or intimidation”. To do so, argued the Post, the nation should look to an old law. “A federal law – 18 USC section 1507 – prohibits ‘pickets or parades’ at any judge’s residence, ‘with the intent of influencing’ a jurist ‘in the discharge of his duty’”, noted the editorial. “These are limited and justifiable restraints on where and how people exercise the right to assembly. Citizens should voluntarily abide by them, in letter and spirit. If not, the relevant governments should take appropriate action.” On Tuesday, Post columnist Marc Thiessen, who worked as the chief speechwriter for President George W Bush at the time that Roberts and Alito were confirmed to the court, amplified this argument, writing an opinion piece calling on the Biden administration to “enforce federal law barring harassment of the justices and their families in their homes”. The supposedly “limited and justifiable” anti-picketing statute being cited by all these people – 18 USC § 1507 – was enacted as part of the Internal Security Act of 1950, a law requiring communist organizations to register with the government. This particular statute was specifically written to respond to reports of protests outside federal courts during US prosecutions of alleged communist party leaders. One of the statute’s proponents, the segregationist senator Allen Ellender, a Louisiana Democrat, explained at the time: “The practice of picketing courts is of recent origin, and apparently has been employed almost solely in connection with proceedings involving alleged Communist party members and sympathizers … If we are to keep our national judiciary on the high plane it has enjoyed since the founding of this country, we must restrain these disgraceful practices, adopted by persons and groups who would undermine our country by first undermining our judiciary.” The court has subsequently struck down portions of the broader Internal Security Act. Furthermore, in 1983, the court limited the government’s prohibition on protests outside the supreme court, finding that the first amendment protects picketing on sidewalks surrounding the court. While the Post’s Aaron Blake wrote a story on Wednesday headlined, “Yes, experts say protests at Scotus justices’ homes appear to be illegal,” one of conservatives’ go-to constitutional law scholars has said that relying on the Internal Security Act statute to quash protests could have troubling constitutional implications. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, who has criticized the protests at justices’ houses, wrote a column in the Hill on Tuesday arguing that using the anti-picketing statute “to arrest protesters would be a serious blow to free speech and would be difficult to defend in the courts”. He similarly told the Wall Street Journal: “As a free speech advocate, I would be very concerned about the use of that statute. I think that what these protesters are doing is reprehensible. I think it’s equally reprehensible for President [Joe] Biden not to denounce this. But when we start to charge protesters with crimes because they’re appearing at the homes of figures, including supreme court justices, you really do raise some first amendment concerns.” Turley added: “I do think that if you brought a prosecution, it would raise some serious constitutional questions. And I would not bet on that being upheld on appeal.” * Beyond the troubling historical legacy of the statute they are referencing, there is another problem with conservatives calling for the detention of these protesters: They only seem to worry about such demonstrations when they’re being done by the left. Hawley, for example, didn’t call for anyone to “vigorously investigate and prosecute” the insurrectionists who violently stormed the US Capitol last year. In fact, he cheered on those protesters shortly before the insurrection and since then, his campaign has been selling merchandise sporting pictures of him raising a fist to those insurrectionists. Similarly, while the Post’s editorial board noted that it was important to prevent political dissent “from turning into harassment or intimidation”, the anti-abortion movement has been known to picket the homes of people who work at abortion clinics – and worse. Violence against abortion clinics has been on the rise, and clinics around the country are worried that attacks will spike after the supreme court issues its abortion decision. What’s more, the supreme court has in the past approved efforts by protesters to picket private residences – and specifically did so in a case involving protests by the anti-abortion movement outside the homes of abortion clinic workers. In 1994, the supreme court found that a Florida court’s content-neutral injunction creating a 300ft protest-free buffer zone around the residences of abortion clinic workers’ homes was unconstitutional and over-broad. The court found “a limitation on the time, duration of picketing, and number of pickets outside a smaller zone could have accomplished the desired result”. Finally, by selectively boosting outrage over public protests, corporate media is only making matters worse. After the George Floyd protests in 2020, major outlets appeared far more concerned about the specter of looters and rioters than they were about the actual grave injustice of a police officer murdering an unarmed Black man for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill. News outlets have also been deeply perturbed by activists’ calls to “defund” the police in the wake of Floyd’s murder. While no cities have actually slashed police budgets, it’s become incredibly common for pundits and conservative Democrats to say that the “defund” movement is weighing down the party. Thanks to such selective hullabaloo, new legislative attempts to curtail public protests will likely be forthcoming – and unlike Democratic lawmakers’ doomed attempt to protect abortion rights on Wednesday, these efforts could be successful. On Monday, the US Senate unanimously passed a measure offered by the Republican senator John Cornyn and Democrat Chris Coons to extend supreme court police protection to justices’ families. A previous version of the legislation offered by Cornyn would have allowed the supreme court police to arrest anyone who “knowingly and willfully obstructs, resists, or interferes with a member of the supreme court police” busy protecting justices or their families. Coons noted in a press release: “Sections from an earlier draft of this bill were removed prior to introduction, citing free speech concerns.” Andrew Perez is a senior editor at the Daily Poster and a co-founder of the Democratic Policy Center David Sirota is a Guardian US columnist and an award-winning investigative journalist.

5/13/2022,"At 3.30am on the night of 23 April 1993, at a secret location somewhere in France, a man struggled in pitch-blackness to dig a hole in which to bury something stowed in his car boot. “I hadn’t even finished, and my hands were bloody,” he later told Libération. “When it was done, I went far away, to get breakfast. I looked at myself in the mirror at the cafe. I was barely recognisable, dishevelled, covered in earth.” The man, who became known to thousands of French people as Max Valentin, had hidden a small bronze owl sculpture, instigating what would become one of the world’s longest treasure hunts. The site’s location could be divined by solving 11 riddles – a combination of fiendish linguistic games, cartographical ciphers, historical allusions and mathematical brainteasers – published in a book, On the Trail of the Golden Owl, that sent amateur treasure hunters poring over maps and scouring obscure villages with metal detectors. Whoever unearthed the owl would win an identical sculpture, made of gold, silver, rubies and diamonds, and worth 1m francs (about €150,000, or £126,000, in today’s money). But, with a puzzle-setter’s precision, Valentin died exactly 16 years later, on the night of 23 April 2009, with the owl still undiscovered. It’s still out there now. Top: Elisa, photographed in Saint-Maurice-de-Rémens, in the grounds of a 18th-century château. Elisa was in her campervan, intending to stay the night. Above, left: Funambule, whose name translates as ‘tightrope walker’; many of the searchers, or chouetteurs, have pseudonyms they use on online forums dedicated to the hunt. Above right: Alain, a committed treasure hunter who read about the quest in his local paper in 2009. ‘It was exciting that the hunt had been running for 15 years and no one had found it’ “I’m really interested in obsession, and the different ways it manifests itself in people’s lives,” says the British photographer Emily Graham, whose new book The Blindest Man follows a few of the hundreds of chouetteurs (owl-hunters) still on the trail. Its title references one of the clues in the hunt, a riff on the proverb “There’s none so blind as those who will not see”. She quickly became absorbed by the details of the golden owl story – especially the absurd tenacity of those involved. “Treasure hunts were a playful way for me to explore those human characteristics. There’s almost something childlike about the ways people allow themselves to be lost in pursuit, which I found alluring. There’s a sense of wonder that often gets excluded from adult life.” Anyone who got caught up in 2016’s Pokémon Go mania would understand – but it seems doubtful that game will still be running in 30 years’ time. There is an association, A2CO, bringing the chouetteurs together on internet forums to scrutinise the 11 puzzles; the first reveals their running order according to colour wavelengths, and the subsequent ones should gradually pinpoint a dig site somewhere in France. “My First, first half of half of the first age / Precedes my Second and Third, seeking their path … ” starts the octet of the first true riddle; it’s accompanied by an illustration of a cockerel with a halo of the map of France – hinting at its geographical significance. Since 2003, some of A2CO’s 165 members have met once a year at an annual convention. After so much time, the hunters have become factionalised – for one, there are “Daboists” who believe the locality is the north-eastern village of Dabo, and “anti-Daboists”. Top: a photograph belonging to treasure hunter Yvon Crolot linking his interpretation of the clues to a location in France. Above: another photograph annotated by Crolot in the course of his research Graham’s book captures this problem-solving free-for-all, with its photographs of mysterious flotsam on the road suddenly imbued with meaning, and chouetteurs apparently gripped by revelations. For her, this work of searching and interpretation, and the byways of fantasy and disorientation they can lead down, was analogous to her trade. “There was a rich imaginative world connected to the searchers,” she says. While the clues were seemingly based on logic, the players’ searches often led them into the realm of fiction and fantasy, gripped by erroneous solutions. “In the documentary field, the photographer is often portrayed as hunter and recorder of truths. But many critics counter this by examining photography’s partiality. I wanted to draw a parallel between the treasure hunter and the photographer as a way of reflecting on photography’s own slippery relationship to truth.” Valentin enjoyed stoking the search in playful exchanges with treasure hunters on Minitel, a pioneering pre-internet French telecoms system. He sent 6,000 messages, full of tantalising hints and red herrings, in the first three months alone. Valentin’s real name was Régis Hauser; the one-time marketing consultant created On the Trail of the Golden Owl in collaboration with artist Michel Becker, who designed the sculpture. It was the latest in a trend of armchair treasure hunts kicked off by Kit Williams’s 1979 book Masquerade, which set British readers sleuthing for a golden hare; perhaps Hauser was also influenced by the quasi-roleplay setups of TV gameshows such as Fort Boyard and its UK counterpart The Crystal Maze. As the years accrued, Valentin’s collected pronouncements (called madits, or “he-told-mes” in chouetteur parlance) were given hadith-like weight by the community, and the gamemaster gained mythic status. Since 2014, Graham has photographed 10 chouetteurs and accompanied two on their quests. “The thing I found fascinating was that so many of them felt they were always on the verge of finding the owl,” she says. Cédric Delepaut, a 50-year-old organiser of nature discovery walks around Aveyron, would agree. He was part of the original wave of 1990s players, but stopped in 1998 for 10 years. Then a chance conversation about treasure hunts got him fired up again, and he decided his original theory had been flawed. “When I reopened the book, I hit on a lead no one else had, and knew I had to continue,” he says. “It occupies your mind day and night. You don’t sleep when you find something new. It’s like a drug!” Top: Celine, who became addicted to the puzzle, working on it day and night, particularly when she was pregnant with her first child, photographed at home after the chouetteurs’ annual convention in 2018. Above left: Cédric Delepaut, who was part of the original wave of searchers in the 90s and rejoined the hunt after a 10-year break. This is his disguise to stay anonymous to other hunters. Above right: Meteor, a famed hunter who found another of puzzlemaster Max Valentin’s prizes, Le trésor d’Orval. He is thought by many to be the most likely candidate to find the golden owl But the hunt has led some to places of disillusionment, and worse. A few searchers began to doubt that the byzantine riddles had any definitive solution. One believed the prize was booby-trapped, and that Valentin was trying to kill him. Generally, the late gamemaster is revered, but Becker is a more contentious figure for some chouetteurs – especially after he tried auctioning the original gold sculpture in 2014, saying the game was null and void following Valentin’s death (the sale was eventually cancelled). Yvon Crolot, a 78-year-old retired engineer from Paris, spent 20 years chasing the owl – but now alleges the hunt was a “fraud” from the start, and that nothing was originally buried on the spot with the metaphorical X. He does believe the riddles specified a location, and that he found it: on a mountainside in the commune of Lus-la-Croix-Haute in Drôme. But he came back from his dig empty-handed. On the treasure hunt’s 25th anniversary in 2018, he filed a legal complaint against Valentin’s inheritors and Becker to try to force them to reveal the solution (the complaint is still being considered). A former court researcher, Crolot has been conducting his own independent investigation for eight years. “I’m trying to understand how hundreds of thousands of people were taken advantage of to this degree,” he says. Becker says Crolot is frustrated by his fruitless searches, but won’t respond to specific accusations while the legal case is active. He says he put the owl up for sale during a period when he was “fed up” with the game, but has since fallen in love once more with it: “I’m fascinated by the human side – the community of players is extraordinary.” As part of an effort to keep interest in the game running, he recently exhumed the now heavily corroded bronze owl and replaced it with a substitute. Despite his claims, Crolot concedes that Valentin’s original divertissement had a certain genius. “I took as much pleasure from the hunt for the owl as from the enigmas the justice system offered me,” he says. And the journey, not the ultimate destination, is where Graham sees the real beauty. She cites another chouetteur, quoted at length in the book, whose motives aspire to a higher plane: “It’s a whole way of seeing for her – a kind of spiritual pursuit. It’s about looking and appreciating the world, and seeing signs around you. It’s quite beautiful the way that she talks about it.”  The Blindest Man is published by Void in June.",Arts/Art and design,The mystery of the buried owl: the 30-year treasure hunt baffling French puzzlers,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/13/the-mystery-of-the-buried-owl-the-30-year-treasure-hunt-baffling-french-puzzlers
5/13/2022,"The first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine. Shysimarin, who has been held in Ukrainian custody, is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles came under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead a 62-year-old unarmed man who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened “dozens of metres” from the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said before the trial opened: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”. The trial is another propaganda triumph for Kyiv, and comes as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine’s general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. Elsewhere on the ground on Friday, Ukraine claimed that it had damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea. “Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire – it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,” said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine’s sea border with Romania. Maxar images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine’s north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, around 40km (25 miles) east of Kharkiv. Regional authorities reported ongoing missile strikes around Poltava and shelling at Dergach, near Kharkiv, that killed two people. Russia’s army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. Fighting has continued in Ukraine’s south and east. Ukraine’s presidency said shelling continued throughout Lugansk – part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his Thursday night address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 health care facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. “What for? It’s nonsense. It’s barbarity.” In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Iryna Vereshchuk, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said “difficult talks” were under way over the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. “We have started a new round of negotiations around a road map for an [evacuation] operation. And we will start with those who are badly wounded,” she told 1+1 television.",News/World news,First Russian soldier goes on trial in Ukraine for war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/first-russian-soldier-goes-on-trial-in-ukraine-for-war-crimes
5/13/2022,"Many owners might have been tempted to send Stradivarius off to stud at the end of 2018, when his big-race wins included the Ascot Gold Cup and Goodwood Cup. If so, his first crop of two-year-olds would have been stepping on to the track this spring. Instead, the grand old horse himself is still going strong and about to start his seventh season on the racecourse in Friday’s Yorkshire Cup. Cavalryman, in 2014, is the only eight-year-old “entire” horse to win at Group Two level in Britain in the last 20 years, and John Gosden, Stradivarius’s trainer, said this week that he is “certainly not giving him hard, hard works at home, he’s too old for that”. Gosden added: “I don’t want everyone there thinking he’s going to necessarily go and win another Yorkshire Cup, I’d just like to see him run a race that acts as a platform going forward.” On that basis, Stradivarius looks too short for Friday’s race at 4-5 and Dermot Weld’s gritty mare Search For A Song (3.35) is the obvious one to bet against him at around 5-1. The six-year-old has Group One-winning form in the 2020 Irish St Leger, has the benefit of a run behind her already this year and gets a handy 6lb from the favourite. York 1.50: An astonishing 13 of these juveniles – in a 16-strong field – were winners last time out so the biggest improver is likely to land the spoils. Fix You is a tentative pick having put up a fair performance on the clock when going clear on debut at Thirsk last month. Newbury 2.05: Puerto De Vega was much improved on the all-weather over the winter and will go close if transferring that form back to the turf. York 2.25: John Gosden’s Grande Dame won despite very obvious greenness at Ascot last month and should take this step up in class in her stride. York 3.00: A couple of fancied runners have a stamina question to answer so Belloccio could be a fair bet at around 6-1 to follow up a career-best at Kempton last month. York 4.10: A strong hand here for Charlie Appleby, with Yibir’s brother Wild Crusade a marginal pick over the unbeaten New Comedy after his ready win on handicap debut at Kempton last month. Thirty-six years after his first success in the Dante Stakes with Shahrastani, Sir Michael Stoute was back on track in more ways than one at York on Thursday as Desert Crown, a big gamble for the Derby in recent weeks, quickened clear of seven opponents in Britain’s last major trial and took over as the new favourite for the Classic on 4 June. Stoute was Britain’s champion trainer 10 times between 1981 and 2009 and has five Derby winner’s trophies on his mantlepiece at Freemason Lodge, the most recent from Workforce’s Epsom victory in 2010 after he had finished second in the Dante. His once pre-eminent stable has not had so much as a runner in the Derby since 2016, however, and only two starters in the premier Classic since Carlton House, the favourite, narrowly missed out behind Pour Moi in 2011. Stoute’s appearances on the racecourse have also become increasingly rare in recent months but he was on the Knavesmire to see Desert Crown cut through the field from two furlongs out and then extend his lead over Royal Patronage to three-and-a-quarter lengths at the line, despite drifting right in the closing stages. Desert Crown is open to any amount of improvement after what was only the second start of his career, and this victory was enough to see him end Stone Age’s four-day reign as Derby favourite after his wide-margin win at Leopardstown on Sunday. Stoute’s colt is now top-priced at 9-4 (from 7-1) for Epsom with Stone Age out to 100-30. Changingoftheguard, O’Brien’s Chester Vase winner, at 9-1 is the only other runner at single-figure odds. “It’s only his second race, he’s travelled well and he’s accelerated pleasingly,” Stoute said afterwards. “You have to be very happy with that performance. “I thought it was a strong Dante, but I wasn’t confident because I felt we’d only just got him up to a race having had a minor setback late February. We didn’t rush him, we took our time and he was only just ready to run now.” Richard Kingscote, Desert Crown’s jockey, has had just one previous ride in the Derby, finishing 11th of 12 on the 14-1 shot Knight To Behold in 2018, but can now look forward to riding the favourite in three weeks’ time. Kingscote is effectively No.2 behind Ryan Moore at the Stoute stable, but Moore’s first commitment to ride for Aidan O’Brien – who had the third-home Bluegrass on Thursday – is likely to see him riding Stone Age at Epsom. “Of course, Ryan’s horse in Ireland [Stone Age] was very impressive and going to a Derby is always going to be difficult,” Kingscote said. “He’s done well from two to three, I was taken with how well he’s filled out and they’ve done a great job with him. “I’m in a very privileged position to be able to work under Sir Michael and Ryan, I’ve been lucky Ryan had one in the race today and people were nice enough to let me on.

Gosden added: “I don’t want everyone there thinking he’s going to necessarily go and win another Yorkshire Cup, I’d just like to see him run a race that acts as a platform going forward.” On that basis, Stradivarius looks too short for Friday’s race at 4-5 and Dermot Weld’s gritty mare Search For A Song (3.35) is the obvious one to bet against him at around 5-1. The six-year-old has Group One-winning form in the 2020 Irish St Leger, has the benefit of a run behind her already this year and gets a handy 6lb from the favourite. York 1.50: An astonishing 13 of these juveniles – in a 16-strong field – were winners last time out so the biggest improver is likely to land the spoils. Fix You is a tentative pick having put up a fair performance on the clock when going clear on debut at Thirsk last month. Newbury 2.05: Puerto De Vega was much improved on the all-weather over the winter and will go close if transferring that form back to the turf. York 2.25: John Gosden’s Grande Dame won despite very obvious greenness at Ascot last month and should take this step up in class in her stride. York 3.00: A couple of fancied runners have a stamina question to answer so Belloccio could be a fair bet at around 6-1 to follow up a career-best at Kempton last month. York 4.10: A strong hand here for Charlie Appleby, with Yibir’s brother Wild Crusade a marginal pick over the unbeaten New Comedy after his ready win on handicap debut at Kempton last month.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: grand old Stradivarius too short for Yorkshire Cup ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/12/desert-crown-is-new-derby-favourite-after-storming-dante-stakes-win
5/13/2022,"It’s fair to say that James Cameron probably expected a little more hype around the debut trailer for Avatar: The Way of Water, which finally dropped this week, more than 12 years after the first film opened in cinemas. The internet has reacted with a collective yawn, and there have been a fair few comment pieces wondering if anyone really cares about a return to the forests and oceans of Pandora. It turns out they do. Or at least, enough to watch the trailer anyway. According to the Hollywood Reporter, the new promo was viewed 148.6m times on its first day of release, which is more than the trailers for the recent Star Wars movies, The Incredibles 2 or Black Widow got. Nobody knows at this stage, of course, how many of those viewers will actually turn up to see the movie. But for the mealy-mouthed naysayers out there (myself included), this surely ought to be a wake-up call. People are interested in Pandora, the 3D revolution is still a thing, and Cameron’s plans to set 20 more movies in the same solar system over the next 400 years are in no way overambitious or likely to end in ruin. The reason some of us grumpier fans are struggling to get excited about Cameron’s sequel is that it missed its chance to make a real cultural imprint by failing to materialise as promised in 2014, and subsequently when its release was pushed back a full half-dozen times. That’s if it was ever going to make much impact. When I mention Avatar to my seven- and nine-year-old sons, they think I am talking about the similarly named but unrelated noughties animated series, which is ubiquitous on streaming channels and far easier to access than the movie. This is despite the fact that I have shown them the James Cameron movie at least twice. Nevertheless, I think we may be underestimating the appeal of Avatar. In the wake of the first film’s release there were reports of fans getting seriously down because they did not live on Pandora and would never get to romance beautiful 12-foot-tall blue forest elves with USB-compatible tails. Even if Cameron stood accused of borrowing themes from various other movies (the legal department would like me to point out that he won several court cases accusing him of plagiarism in the wake of the film’s release) he also invented a world that had a deeply emotional effect on people. Has anyone ever experienced existential sadness about not living on Tatooine, on Vulcan or in Tony Stark’s Avengers tower? The difference is that fans of Star Wars, Marvel and Star Trek get new content thrown at them at ever more frequent intervals, and so receive enough injections of high-end fantasy storytelling to keep their geeky dreams sparkling like sapphires through the night. Yet people moan constantly about there being too many Star Wars movies, too much Marvel, too many superhero flicks. Cameron has spent more than a decade making sure that by the time Avatar 2 finally hits multiplexes, there is nothing for fans to moan about. Except, of course, that they will still find something. Yes, the first teaser trailer for The Way of Water may have been underwhelming. No, we don’t know why that human kid running around with Jake and Neytiri isn’t dying from suffocation, given we’re told Pandora’s atmosphere is a poisonous mix of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, xenon, methane, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide. And yes, Cameron is going to have to come up with a better storyline than mean old humans getting tonked by the natives all over again (except this time mostly in the water). But this is the film-maker who gave us Aliens. He is nothing if not a perfectionist. Maybe all of us post-lockdown content-guzzling gutbuckets just need to chill and wait until we see the final movie before we pass judgment, rather than basing our opinions on some mildly disappointing early footage. Come December we will all be back on Pandora, swishing our giant tails and enveloped in gorgeous stereoscope. And for as long as the movie is running at least, no one will have to feel distressed again that they actually live in Bracknell, occupy a perfectly nice ground-floor garden flat and work in mobile phone sales consultancy.",Arts/Film,True blue: can James Cameron’s Avatar 2 silence the naysayers?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/13/james-cameron-avatar-2-the-way-of-water-trailer-pandora
5/13/2022,"The former Brexit minister David Frost has said the UK should not fear a trade war with the EU. In a provocative newspaper column, he said the UK “cannot be defeated” by Brussels and needed to “make sure it is ready” for the consequences of a unilateral move to scrap parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is planning to table legislation next week to disapply some of the protocol in a risky move that could result in sanctions or even the suspension of the trade deal that Lord Frost negotiated in December 2020. Writing in the Daily Telegraph about the potential move, Frost said: “We may, of course, face EU retaliation, although it would be disproportionate to the trade involved, only arguably legal and entirely self-defeating. I am not convinced every EU member’s heart would be in it either. Logic may yet prevail. But if it does happen, it will complicate things, but we should not fear it.” Adding to tensions with Europe, Jacob Rees-Mogg claimed on Friday the EU “wants to make the UK feel bad about having left the European Union”. But the Brexit opportunities minister told GB News he doubted the EU would retaliate with something as severe as a trade war if the UK were to remove parts of the protocol, saying it would be a “pretty silly” thing to do. He questioned whether Brussels would even get the support of all member states. “The European Union would need unanimity and it seems to me that’s a pretty high bar to get,” he told GB News on Friday. He also argued the EU would be punishing its own voters by introducing a trade war at a time of rising inflation and the cost of living crisis. “Do they really want to make prices even higher for their consumers and their voters? I think that’s an interesting and important question.” “The EU … may decide it wants an act of self-harm, that is not under our control, but it would be a pretty silly thing to do,” he added. Truss has argued she would have no option but to act if the EU did not concede to the UK’s demands to scrap the checks on goods crossing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It is a high-stakes move that is testing relations with EU leaders but is also timed to exploit the lack of appetite in Europe for a trade war with a former ally at a time when political focus is on Russia and the expansion of Nato. Frost has become one of the most vocal critics of the Brexit deal since he quit his role in December. In his column he defends the government’s decision to go ahead with what Boris Johnson had called his “oven-ready” deal, arguing the UK had no choice but to sign the protocol as it was the only way to realise Britain’s departure from the EU. “It was the right thing to do. If we hadn’t, I think we would still be in the EU now,” he said. Earlier this week Frost told the US president, Joe Biden, who has invested much of his career in supporting peace in Northern Ireland, to butt out of UK business. “I get slightly frustrated when we are told by a third party, albeit a very important one in this context, how to manage these issues,” he told a thinktank in the US. “It is our country that faced terrorism, faced the Troubles. I am old enough to remember having to check under my car every morning, as a diplomat, before I went to work. Most people were very affected in one way or another by this.” His remarks come as a delegation of influential US Congress representatives, including the head of the ways and means committee, Richard Neal, plan to fly to London amid growing concern in the White House about spiralling tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol.",News/Politics,"UK should not fear EU trade war, says Frost as he backs ripping up protocol",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/uk-should-not-fear-eu-trade-war-frost-backs-ripping-up-protocol

5/13/2022,"Few thought the day would ever come, but an earthquake is about to shake up French politics. Ahead of next month’s legislative elections, France’s famously fractious leftwing parties have decided to join forces, with Europe Ecology-the Greens (EELV), the Socialist party (PS) and the French Communist party (PCF) coalescing around Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s left populist La France Insoumise (LFI) and uniting around a common set of candidates. In France’s semi-presidential system, the legislative elections often go overlooked, but they play a decisive role in determining how much of the president’s agenda can actually be enacted. Without a majority in the national assembly, the president is forced to share power with a rival prime minister and cabinet – a situation known as “cohabitation”. It’s happened three times before, but not since 2002, when legislative elections were moved to take place just after the presidential election. And yet, cohabitation is a real possibility in today’s highly volatile landscape, with polls suggesting the new unity coalition – the Nouvelle union populaire écologiste et sociale (Nupes) – on track to win a significant share of seats. Even if it does fall short of obtaining an outright majority and forming a government of its own, a newly empowered left bloc in parliament could pose headaches for the president, Emmanuel Macron, as he embarks on his second term in the Elysée. Reaching a deal wasn’t easy and tensions remain, but the unity pact has been fuelled by a mix of shared ideological commitments, a heavy dose of self-interest and a certain willingness to compromise. Before the presidential elections, each of the coalition members was gunning for a prime spot in the legislatives. But then came Mélenchon’s strong performance in the first round of the presidentials, nearly beating Marine Le Pen to enter the final round. Any lingering doubts over the French left’s centre of gravity were laid to rest. While La France Insoumise won 22% of the first-round vote, candidates for the Greens, Communists and Socialists each earned less than 5% – lacklustre results that couldn’t be papered over and that also had the effect of depriving them of generous public subsidies. Voters had spoken and they preferred Mélenchon’s line: massive state spending to tackle the climate crisis; wealth redistribution and worker protections; an unapologetic response to rising racism and xenophobia; a willingness to bypass European Union rules if they prevent such policies from being carried out. Shortly after the second round, La France Insoumise extended an invitation to negotiate on the basis of this programme – and the offer was taken up. While Mélenchon’s party remained in the driver’s seat, it also proved willing to make concessions: it will supply a majority of the coalition’s candidates, but the other three parties have been allotted shares of favourable legislative districts, setting them up to win at least 15 seats each and form parliamentary groups of their own. Intra-party statements also bear the language of compromise. To assuage the Europhiles of the Greens and Socialists, LFI has emphasised its firm attachment to the European Union and the eurozone; while the two parties have stressed they’re prepared to sidestep certain EU rules – particularly those that constrain public spending. Frictions persist. Some of the Socialist old guard is enraged over the deal, including the former president François Hollande, who views it as a betrayal of his legacy. A few Socialists expected to run don’t yet have the formal blessing of the coalition or may not even want it. The Communists have sparred with La France Insoumise over a particular seat in the suburbs of Lyon. Critics have rightfully pointed out the lack of candidates who resemble the working-class and immigrant voters who nearly put Mélenchon in the run-off round last month. Still, the accord looks set to last at least through June’s elections. While polls show a vast majority of self-identified leftwing voters support the deal, it has also sparked a predictably over-the-top backlash from pundits and political rivals. Le Pen has warned it will lead to prison abolitionist, “pro-burkini” anarchists wreaking havoc in the National Assembly, while Macron and his allies have painted the coalition as an opportunistic cabal led by “far-left” puppet masters who are unfit to govern. Much of the Nupes programme is, in fact, fairly modest – raising the minimum wage, lowering the retirement age and investing in public services are far from revolutionary proposals – but this is beside the point. What’s probably more upsetting to the president and his far-right rivals is the political clarification under way. The emergence of a powerful electoral bloc centred on La France Insoumise – a coalition committed to wealth redistribution and the defence of ethnic and religious minorities – would betray a myth that has served both Macron and Le Pen in recent years. It would shatter the illusion that their political camps are the only two options on offer (“progressives” versus “nationalists” or “populists” in Macron-speak; or “patriots” versus “globalists” in the language of the far right). It has long been apparent that a giant chunk of the French electorate – millions of young people, a swath of the working-class and a sizeable share of middle-class progressives – doesn’t fit within the narrow confines of this debate. Now these voters finally have a coalition that is serious about representing them and taking power.
