Deputies said Jones was asked to leave multiple times, but she remained in the store, calling 911 to say, “I’m 5 months pregnant. These people don’t know how to run a (expletive) McDonald’s!” Investigators said Jones’ relative and another woman convinced her to leave the restaurant after about 10 minutes. “As Jones got to the exit, she turned toward the employees, lifted her shirt to expose her belly, then turned and began twerking at them,” the Sheriff’s Office said.

5/21/2022,"Jacky Eubanks is running for the Michigan legislature with a “wholehearted” endorsement from Donald Trump who calls her “an America First Patriot.” Her agenda? More from Rolling Stone Trump Finds a New Autocrat to Suck Up To in Video Appearance at Europe's CPAC Exclusive: Trump Is Telling Allies His Record on Abortion Could Hurt His 2024 Chances Election Coup Lawyer Trying to Shield Handwritten Trump Notes from Jan. 6 Committee Banning contraception, gay marriage and imposing the “Christian moral order” on the nation. Eubanks, a Gen Z conservative who falsely claims Trump won the 2020 election in Michigan, disclosed her extreme views in an interview on “Church Militant,” a digital media service that has been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an “anti-LGBTQ hate group.” Church Militant is run by Michael Voris, an ex-TV news reporter and formerly gay man who has been criticized as a leader of the “Catholic alt-right.” (Church Militant has strained relations with actual church leaders; it was originally known as RealCatholicTV until the Archdiocese of Detroit told Voris he was not “authorized” to use the word Catholic in his branding.) In the interview, posted to Eubank’s campaign Facebook page on Thursday, she insisted she is not a typical politician, “walking in the ways of the wicked,” and said her campaign is a manifestation of “God bringing together a coalition of true conservatives to save this country.” Voris and Eubanks engaged in a lengthy discussion of politics and faith. “We see everything going on with Roe right now — the left becoming completely uncorked losing their minds,” Voris said. “They’re saying, ‘They’re coming after your gay marriage next. They’re coming after your birth control.'” He paused a beat before adding with a smile, “Well, you know what… yeah!” Eubanks signaled her agreement, and launched into a fundamentalist diatribe. “You cannot have a successful society outside of the Christian moral order,” she claimed, insisting that “things like abortion and things like gay marriage are outside the Christian moral order.” Eubanks added: “They lead to chaos and destruction and a culture of death; we’ve abandoned the Christian moral order as a nation and we are reaping that destruction.” When Voris suggested to Eubanks that her political opponents are likely to paint that as extreme, Eubanks countered: “I don’t see what we believe as extreme at all. We need to return to God’s moral order. That’s not radical. God’s morality is for everybody,” she said. “You cannot have happiness outside of God’s moral order.” Voris then drilled down on contraception, specifically, asking Eubanks if she would use her vote in the Michigan statehouse to make it illegal. “We have a declining population. We have an underpopulation problem. All of this could be avoided if we were a truly pro-life nation,” Eubanks said. If contraception came up for a vote, she insisted, “I would have to side with it should not be legal.” Eubanks then blasted the notion of “consequence-fee sex” saying a birth control ban would encourage people to “wait until marriage, to practice chastity.” Such remarks by the Trump-endorsed Eubanks — who also vowed she’d work to ensure that abortion is illegal in Michigan — may increase the former president’s anxiety that his role in appointing anti-choice judges might dim his 2024 prospects with suburban women voters. Such concerns were not top of mind for Voris. Plainly delighted with Eubanks, he warned her: “You’re going to get the Marjorie Taylor Greene treatment.” Eubanks agreed — “They’re going to try to label me crazy,” she said — and insisted that the Georgia congresswoman is her political hero, in particular for standing against “the radical transgender agenda” by trolling a fellow member of Congress. The interview closed out with Eubanks and Voris bashing the political left. “It uses mob violence to achieve its political ends,” Eubanks said, “which is why we saw them burning down the country in the summer of 2020 — all because of ‘saint’ George Floyd.” Cautioning that the left is going to “resort to mob violence” when they see that they’re “losing politically,” Eubanks closed with a stark warning about how she intends to wield state power. “I’m hoping that, through God’s grace, we can use the political positions of legal power that conservatives will get to crush that revolutionary force,” she said. “Over my dead body this country will be Communist — and I mean that.” Watch a portion of the interview below: Trump-endorsed state rep. candidate Jacky Eubanks says that if it came to a vote in the MI legislature, she would vote to make birth control illegal. “Sex ought to be between one man and one woman in the confines of marriage…and open to life.

5/21/2022,"A Japanese man reportedly gambled away millions of Japanese yen’s worth of COVID relief funds that he received by mistake. Last month, the Japanese government inadvertently sent a COVID relief fund meant for 463 people worth 46.3 million yen ($360,890) to a 24-year-old man. After receiving the amount, the man initially said he would cooperate with local authorities but eventually went into hiding. His sudden disappearance prompted the southern town of Abu in Japan's Yamaguchi Prefecture to file a civil lawsuit while also considering criminal action. While he remains in hiding, his lawyer spoke to the press on Tuesday, saying the man had been cooperating with officials and is willing to be questioned by prefecture authorities.

5/21/2022,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is considering ""all options"" concerning its engagement with the China-led 16+1 platform for cooperation with central and east European states, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday. Several past Czech governments as well as President Milos Zeman have been keen to deepen ties with China, but the interest has cooled since a series of failed Chinese investment projects, Czech warnings against Chinese 5G telecoms technology and a change of government in Prague last year. ""The main initiatives of 16+1, economic diplomacy and the promise of massive investments and mutually beneficial trade, are not being fulfilled even after 10 years,"" minister Jan Lipavsky said in comments to news agency CTK, sent by the ministry's spokeswoman to Reuters. The statement followed a Czech lower house of parliament foreign committee's call on the cabinet on Thursday to quit the group. The new Czech centre-right cabinet has pledged to build up relations with democracies including self-ruled Taiwan - which China sees as a breakaway province - and put its China policies under review. ""The unfulfilled promises lead to the consideration of all options of our future role in the platform,"" he said.

Bladder cancer is often referred to as the ""forgotten cancer"" — but it shouldn't be. The disease is the fifth most common cancer in Canada and one of the most frequently diagnosed among men. According to the Canadian Cancer Society, it's estimated that in 2022, 13,300 Canadians will be diagnosed with bladder cancer, 2,500 of whom will die from the disease. Because the warning signs of bladder cancer are often mistaken for other health conditions like urinary tract and kidney infections, early detection may not be as clear-cut as other diseases. What are the signs and symptoms of bladder cancer, and what are its risk factors? Here's what you need to know. Bladder cancer begins when formerly healthy cells in the bladder start to grow abnormally and multiply. The vast majority (90 per cent) of bladder cancer cases occur in the organ's inner lining and are known as urothelial carcinoma or transitional cell carcinoma. When the disease develops in the bladder lining, it's referred to as superficial bladder cancer. Alternatively, when the cancer has spread through the lining and invades the muscle wall or spreads to nearby organs and lymph nodes, it's called invasive bladder cancer. Nine in 10 bladder cancer cases in Canada are diagnosed in populations ages 50 and older. Bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among men and the 10th most commonly diagnosed among women. While it's a lesser-known cancer, you may remember several celebrities whom the disease has impacted. Frank Sinatra was diagnosed with bladder cancer in his final years (he ultimately passed away from a heart attack), NBA star Maurice Lucas underwent surgery for bladder cancer and later died from the disease at age 58, and Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh underwent treatment for his diagnosis in 2015. In Canada, if you're of a certain age or population group, screening tests are available for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. However, bladder cancer is a different story. As of today, there are no early screening tests available for bladder cancer. Therefore, most people are diagnosed after reporting symptoms, most commonly, blood in the urine. According to Dr. Girish Kulkarni, a urologic surgeon in the Department of Surgical Oncology at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, blood in the urine should never be ignored, even if it's a one-time occurrence. ""If someone visibly sees blood, even one time, they should have a thorough assessment,"" Kulkarni tells Yahoo Canada. In addition to blood in the urine, signs or symptoms of bladder cancer may include: Pain or burning during urination Frequent and urgent urination Feeling the need to urinate but not being able to Experiencing symptoms despite no signs of infections Kulkarni says that in addition to blood, pain should never be ignored, as it may indicate a more advanced stage of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer can affect anyone; however, certain populations are considerably more at-risk than others. Unlike cancers linked to the so-called ""cancer gene"" (inherited gene mutations), the risk of developing bladder cancer is almost entirely lifestyle-related. According to Kulkarni, smoking is the ""no. 1 risk factor associated with bladder cancer."" Additionally, occupational exposures to specific chemicals are often tied to diagnoses, including those found in hair dyes, paints, fungicides, cigarette smoke, plastics, metals and motor vehicle exhaust. Because of its risk factors, bladder cancer tends to disproportionately affect populations of ""lower socioeconomic status,"" says Kulkarni. ""Think of the people working with chemicals: Painters, factory workers, hairdressers, [etc.],"" those are the groups who are most at-risk. One of the theories that explains why men are diagnosed at higher rates than women are the lifestyle factors mentioned. ""Historically, men were the smokers, and men were the ones working with chemicals,"" Kulkarni says. Despite being the fifth-most prevalent cancer in Canada, Kulkarni says bladder cancer is one of the least funded. Bladder cancer is ""often beyond the 20th-rank in terms of funding,"" he says. ""There's a lot of disparity in the research into bladder cancer."" He adds that while ""most people think of breast, prostate, colon, and lung cancers, bladder [cancer] is right there next to them."" However, ""it doesn't get the fifth or sixth-most amount of funding."" It's a ""very prevalent"" and ""very recurrent disease,"" he says. ""It can come back over and over [again]."" The lack of funding ""really [highlights] the disparities in cancer care"" in Canada. To learn more about bladder cancer, see the resources below.

The results of a clinical trial show using immunotherapy immediately after chemotherapy treatment in patients with metastatic bladder cancer significantly slowed the progression of cancer. The study is the first to show that this approach to therapy, called switch maintenance immunotherapy, significantly slows the worsening of a type of bladder cancer called urothelial cancer. The randomised Phase 2 trial tested this treatment in 108 patients. The trial tested immunotherapy known as pembrolizumab after patients were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in one group of patients and used a placebo after the same type of chemotherapy in a second group. The time until cancer progressed was approximately 60 per cent longer for the pembrolizumab group compared with the control group.",Health/Yahoo Canada Style,Are you at risk for bladder cancer?

5/21/2022,"On Thursday, the three leaders of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation addressed the controversy that has surrounded the organization over the last month. When it was revealed in April by New York Magazine that BLM founder Patrisse Cullors secretly purchased a $5.8 million mansion in Southern California, outraged quickly ensued. In an effort of transparency, the 990s were posted on the Black Lives Matter foundation website.
 Cicley Gay, D’Zhane Parker and Shalomyah Bowers held a media roundtable discussion to address the organizational finances. Bowers, whose consulting firm received $2 million, according to the tax documents, explained how that’s typical in businesses: “Less than 10% [of the $79 million raised] were dedicated to overhead and operational expenses, which is in stark contracts to the 30% in overhead costs from organizations that get A ratings from nonprofit watchdog organizations like GuideStar.” Read more &#39;You Got McDonald&#39;s Money?&#39; and Other Phrases We Remember From Childhood &lt;i&gt;Black in the Day&lt;/i&gt;: Barrettes, Blue Magic and Other Ways We Laid Our Hair Cheat Sheet: What is Critical Race Theory? Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce He went onto explain more of how BLM funds have been distributed. “Over $25 million has been reinvested into the Black community; that broken down represents over $10 million in grants to Black led frontline organizations, truly doing the work of abolition on the ground. Over $13 million in grants [has gone] to Black Lives Matter chapters. Nearly $3 million have gone out in grants to impacted family foundations. $3 million has gone out directly for relief to Black people who were struggling during COVID when the administration was providing stimulus checks.” The house purchased by Cullors was also addressed, though Gay clarified that her and Parker joined BLM after it was purchased. Bowers explained how the mansion serves as a house for the “Black Joy Creators Fellowship.” “The creator’s house was purchased as a space of our own with the intention of providing housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship in service to Black culture. The intention is that Black creatives will have an opportunity to launch online content,” Gay added. When asked if the house was currently occupied by anyone, the board members confirmed that it wasn’t. As far as Cullors’ connection to Black Lives Matter goes: “Patrice is always honored as a movement founder and one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement and hashtag, she stepped down last year. She has no legal connection to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. We as the three board members are leading the foundation,” Gay explained. The filings also revealed that nearly $1 million that media production to Trap Heals LLC, a company founded by Damon Turner who has a child with Cullors. Nearly $840,000 went to Cullors’ brother Paul for security, something BLM will continue to pay for. “He still does currently serve as the organization’s head of security. The concept of having people you know and trust and have done work with in the past as employees or vendors and consultants within an organization or just on your team is not new,” Bowers shared. Cullors isn’t officially attached to BLM anymore, though Parker saying they’re using her legacy with the organization as a turning point. “We are continuing to look over all of those...those learned lessons and figuring out how we could do it better in the future. We are planning to handle things differently moving forward.”",Business/The Root,Black Lives Matter Tries To Explain The Millions And That Mansion,https://news.yahoo.com/black-lives-matter-tries-explain-184100128.html
5/21/2022,"A Ukrainian medic smuggled footage of Mariupol's horrors to AP reporters before they left the city. Yuliia Paievska's footage showed her tending to wounded Ukrainians — and even Russians. A day after she snuck out the video, Russian forces abducted her. Her whereabouts are unknown. A Ukrainian medic was captured by Russian forces in mid-March after sneaking out video evidence of the war's devastation. Yuliia Paievska — known in Ukraine as Taira — recorded 256 gigabytes of harrowing and graphic footage from a helmet camera in Mariupol over a two-week period during Russia's siege on the city, the Associated Press reported on Thursday. Taira, 53, handed off the camera card to an AP team. The team of journalists — one of whom hid the evidence in a tampon — made their way through over a dozen Russian checkpoints before they escaped the strategic southern port city in a humanitarian convoy, the report said. Taira was captured by Russian troops the next day, the report continued. Russian broadcasters aired a video of her and accused her of trying to flee the city in disguise. She hasn't been seen since. The footage, published in Thursday's report, documents the efforts of Taira's team to save the lives of wounded Ukrainians — and even Russians. In one video, a team of medics could be seen trying to save a young boy's life. He didn't survive, and Taira turned away — placing a bloodied hand on a wall. The helmet footage picked up sounds of her sobbing, as medical devices beeped in the background. She then shut the boy's eyes. Another video published by the AP showed Taira removing bloodied gloves from her hands, before moving to footage of her hustling down a hallway behind first responders as they pushed a stretcher. The following frame showed Taira tending to the wounded and bloodied face of a man — opening his eyelid with extreme caution as he took deep breaths. More footage from Taira's helmet camera showed a soldier being carried away on a stretcher, before cutting to a shot of a soldier's bloodied face getting bandaged by medics. In the next frame, medics performed CPR on an unidentified person. Since her abduction, a website was published showing how long Taira has been in Russian captivity since March 16 — 65 days and counting. Efforts between Ukraine and Russia to involve her in a prisoner swap have stalled. Her husband, Vadim Puzanov, told the AP that he had little to no knowledge of her whereabouts or condition. The website said Russian state media had tried to use Taira in disinformation and propaganda campaigns. ""Accusing a volunteer medic of all mortal sins, including organ trafficking, is already outrageous propaganda — I don't even know who it's for,"" Puzanov said. Medics, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities have consistently been targeted by Russian forces throughout the three-month war. Editor's Note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated how the camera footage was smuggled out of Mariupol, Ukraine. The camera card was handed off by the medic to a team of AP journalists, one of whom hid it in a tampon.
