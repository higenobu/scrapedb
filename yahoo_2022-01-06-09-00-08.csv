1/6/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell requested a new trial after a juror who convicted her told media that he discussed his own experience with sexual abuse during deliberations. Potential jurors had been asked on questionnaires whether they were victims of sexual abuse. Prosecutors also asked the court on Wednesday to open an investigation into the juror's remarks. Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime Jeffrey Epstein associate convicted of sex trafficking and conspiracy last month, has requested a new trial after a juror told multiple media outlets that his own personal experience with sexual abuse helped convince his fellow jurors to convict. The New York Times also reported on Wednesday that a second juror, who spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity, discussed their child sexual abuse experience during deliberations and ""appeared to help shape the jury's discussions."" It's unclear if prosecutors or defense attorneys were aware of this second juror's remarks. The first juror, Scott David, who identified himself only by his first and middle names, told The Independent and Reuters that during deliberations, several of his fellow jurors expressed doubts about the memories that some of Maxwell's accusers described. David said he told his fellow jurors that he had been sexually abused and had similar experiences to those witnesses, saying that some of his memories were clear while others were hazy. ""I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,"" David told The Independent. ""But I can't remember all the details, there are some things that run together."" David also told Reuters that his remarks helped some of the jurors ""come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse."" Ultimately, the jurors deliberated for an agonizing five days before convicting Maxwell on five of the six counts against her. David also said he ""flew through"" the questionnaire he had been given before he was selected as a juror, and didn't recall being asked whether he, or anyone he knew, was a victim of sexual abuse. He added that he would have answered honestly if he was asked. Court documents show that prospective jurors for the Maxwell trial were indeed asked on the questionnaire if they were victims of sexual abuse. Prosecutors on Wednesday filed a letter requesting that the court open an inquiry based on David's remarks to the media and suggested that the judge schedule a hearing in one month. Maxwell's attorneys filed two letters shortly afterward demanding a new trial, and suggesting that all jurors be examined for their conduct. ""The government's request for a hearing is premature because based on undisputed, publicly available information, the Court can and should order a new trial without any evidentiary hearing,"" the defense attorneys wrote. US District Judge Alison Nathan responded Wednesday setting a schedule for Maxwell's lawyers to move for a new trial ""in light of the issues raised."" The defense attorneys will have to file a motion by January 19, and prosecutors must file a response by February 2. Nathan also granted prosecutors' request to offer a court-appointed lawyer to David.

1/6/2022,"MEXICO CITY (AP) ‚Äî The governor of Mexico‚Äôs Morelos state has denied any links to drug traffickers after a 3-year-old photo surfaced showing him posing with three men identified as local drug gang leaders. Former Mexican national soccer team star Cuauhtemoc Blanco won the governorship of Morelos, just south of Mexico City, in 2018 after retiring from soccer. A photo from October of that same year shows him smiling and locking arms with three men, one of whom is under arrest and another who was killed in prison. The third man is allegedly still alive and leading a gang called the ‚ÄúTlahuica Commando‚Äù that may have been involved in the 2019 killing of a community activist. The newspaper El Sol de Mexico says the photo was found on the telephone of another drug suspect. Blanco said Tuesday he had ‚Äúnothing to hide,‚Äù and put it down to the dangers of being a former soccer star who would never deny a fan a photo op. ‚ÄúI have taken a lot of photos as a soccer player,‚Äù Blanco said. He recalled a time when he was seen in a photo along with a son of imprisoned drug lord Joaquin ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù Guzman, noting ‚ÄúI didn't even know who he was, but because I'm such a good guy, I take photos with everyone.‚Äù Asked by reporters when and where the photo published this week was taken ‚Äî it appears to be indoors, in an office or dining room ‚Äî Blanco said ‚ÄúI don't know, I swear, I don't even remember.‚Äù ‚ÄúI take a lot of photos (with people), and I am not going to be asking them, ‚Äòhey, who are you and what do you do for a living?‚Äô‚Äù Blanco said. ‚ÄúI am going to continue taking photos,‚Äù Blanco said defiantly. ‚ÄúPerhaps more will come out.‚Äù Blanco previously served as mayor of the state capital, Cuernavaca. During his professional soccer career he was known for his pugnacious, combative style. Morelos, known for its balmy climate, was once a quiet weekend getaway for Mexico City residents. But in the last two decades it has been hit by kidnappings, extortion and drug gang killings. Blanco has been criticized for naming former soccer associates to state posts.",World/Associated Press,Mexican governor denies drug links after photo with capos,https://news.yahoo.com/mexican-governor-denies-drug-links-200325850.html
1/6/2022,"It marks a big step back into history, from serving as executive officer on the Norfolk-based guided missile cruiser USS Vicksburg to command of the world‚Äôs oldest commissioned naval vessel. Cmdr. Billie Farrell is about to take command of USS Constitution ‚Äî Old Ironsides ‚Äî the first woman to do so in the ship‚Äôs 224 years. Launched in 1797, it saw action against pirates in the Barbary Wars and in the War of 1812, where it won its Old Ironsides title as astonished sailors watched British cannonballs bounce off its wooden hull. USS Constitution defended American interests at sea for decades after that, retiring in 1855 after serving in anti-slaving patrols with the Africa squadron. Old Ironsides captured or sank 33 enemy vessels, and was never defeated in battle. Farrell called USS Constitution an ‚Äúiconic warship that dates back to the roots of both our nation and our Navy,.‚Äù She said she hopes the strengthen the warship‚Äôs legacy ‚Äúby telling her story and connecting it to the rich heritage of the United States Navy and the warships serving in the fleet today.‚Äù While Farrell will be Old Ironsides‚Äô first female commanding officer, it was another woman officer, Lt. Cmdr. Claire V. Bloom, who as executive officer and led the warship‚Äôs historic 1997 sail, the first time it sailed under its own power since 1881. Women now comprise more than a third of USS Constitution‚Äôs 80-strong ship‚Äôs company.
