4/10/2022,"Apast version of me described herself politically as a “pessimistic optimist”. Oxymoronic? Yes. Pretentious? Certainly. But it felt the most accurate way of characterising an outlook that was always prepared for the worst, but able to bear it because things, one day, might get “better”. Back then, I invested my hopefulness in mass political movements, believing that with the right chord-striking campaign – or even party leader – the country would be mobilised and sweeping, vaguely defined change would follow. Unquestionably, “better” has not come to pass. During my lifetime, material conditions for Britons have measurably degraded. In-work poverty has risen to record highs; nearly one in five children in poverty live in a household where all adults are working. Cut through the government’s protestations about increases in public spending and look at the reality: for millions of people, standards of living are the worst they have been. In real-world terms, incomes have remained stagnant or shrunk, while the cost of living – or more accurately, the cost of just-about-surviving – has shot up thanks to a steep rise in just about every basic outgoing. Marked atrophy in our quality of life and crumbling anchor institutions – local government, higher education, the NHS – have contributed to increasing disillusionment in the ability of party politics to create change. Trust in politicians has sunk to its lowest rate on record. In 1944, only 35% of Britons viewed political representatives as “out for themselves”; in 2021, research by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that 63% of British people now held this view. Since 2001, voter turnout for general elections has remained consistently lower than in any held since 1918. Partisan dealignment means the number of people who once strongly identified with a political party has declined. As of 2018, only 9% of the electorate “very strongly identified” with a political party, compared with nearly half of the same demographic in the 1960s. I am one of them: I hold no membership or allegiance to any party. Previously, I was a Labour supporter, automatically, since I had been old enough to understand the basics of the two-party system. At first it was hereditary, as those early political forays often are. Later, it was with all the blazing passion and fierce hope that a 21-year-old can muster. With the slow erosion of that aspect of my political identity came a crisis in optimism – and the beginning of an internal interrogation that would force the formation of my own opinions, rather than just following what sounded about right. Just what were my politics, now I had no parliamentary anchor? What did I actually believe in? I wanted things to get “better” – but what did that even mean? Where should I put all that hope if I didn’t want it to curdle into apathy and nihilism? What I have realised is, if you spend too much time zooming out, your vision blurs. The necessary optimism that keeps the political self moving feels almost impossible if you are painfully, obsessively aware of every social ill that needs amending. You cannot care “too much”, but you can be rendered immobile by the sheer scale of the work that lies ahead. The journalist and ardent campaigner Sarah Woolley once gave me some advice that I have been turning over in my head ever since: “Find three causes you care about,” she said, “and focus on those.” Amid the muck of our current circumstances, I am noticing some green shoots sprouting, in the form of increased non-party political activity from the people around me. My 65-year-old mother, retired and living in rural Herefordshire, has recently joined an extremely dynamic local women’s equality group. Their current fight, she tells me, is addressing the dire lack of local sexual violence services, with providers forced to turn survivors away due to lack of resources. Someone messaged me the other day to report they’d joined a tenants’ union, a growing trend: the independent renters’ union Acorn was founded in Bristol in 2014 and has seen significant growth since, now counting multiple branches across Britain. Localised renters’ unions are gaining steady traction, too; between 2019 and 2020, the London Renters’ Union doubled its membership, while the University of Birmingham’s Guild of Students recently launched a renters’ union initiative for 2022. Elsewhere, I see people volunteering, campaigning, helping out. Most of them do not view these acts as explicitly “political” (despite the grassroots being the bedrock of politics) because they are not tied to traditional parliamentary parties. Instead there are distinct goals attached: a meeting with the West Midlands police commissioner; protecting a resident from eviction; answering an evening shift’s worth of calls to a debt advisory service. Is that limiting? To think “small”? No; it’s what’s needed. “Thinking small” means rebuilding local communities, fractured throughout years of cuts, demographic changes and divisive rhetoric. It means achieving aims that keep you marching forward to the next one, not stopping to be completely overwhelmed by the bigger picture. This is not naivety or denial, but an understanding that sometimes tunnel vision will achieve more than whack-a-mole. Long-term strategy can – and should – run alongside shorter-term objectives. These burgeoning engagements with community action provide me with an injection of optimism. I’m not unrealistic; it’s hardly a tsunami, or even a sea change. But people are getting involved who weren’t before. They are still invested in that promise of better. For too long, fear has been the primary motivator in British politics, driving patterns of disunity and disintegration. Perhaps that will never change on a national scale. Yet those with capacity can still try to make a difference, whatever that looks like, on their doorsteps, otherwise it certainly won’t. Maybe hope is just delusion. So what? Why not give it a go anyway? We’ve tried misery and apathy. They only bore rotten fruit. “Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have,” croons Lana Del Rey at the close of her 2019 album Norman Fucking Rockwell! “But I have it.” I think, against all odds, I still do too.

4/10/2022,"The government is facing fresh calls to reveal the identities of eight sanctioned Russian oligarchs who were allowed to buy “golden visas” to live in the UK. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow minister for immigration, is demanding that the home secretary, Priti Patel, name the eight Russians on the sanctions list and publish a long-withheld report on the now scrapped visa purchase programme. The government closed the “tier 1 investor visa” scheme in February as diplomatic relations with Russia came under severe strain. A week later, Russia invaded Ukraine, prompting the US, EU and UK to impose sanctions on many of Russia’s richest people to try to put pressure on Putin’s regime. Those on the sanctions list include Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC; Alisher Usmanov, the steel and mining magnate described by the EU as one of Putin’s “favourite oligarchs”; and Andrey Guryev Jr, whose family reportedly owns Witanhurst, a mansion in Highgate, north London, that is London’s second largest home after Buckingham Palace. Critics had long warned that the golden visa scheme, under which the super-rich could essentially buy the right to reside in the UK, was open to abuse. The scheme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. The Home Office last month committed to publishing a 2018 report on golden visas that covered the period from their introduction in 2008 by the Labour government up to 2015. The government has not said when it will do so. During that period few if any checks were carried out on applicants, in what the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption described as a “red carpet for dirty money”. About 3,000 millionaires bought the visas during that time, more than 700 of whom were Russians. In the letter to Patel, seen by the Guardian, Kinnock wrote: “By failing to be transparent about the contents of report the government is likely to raise public suspicion, and that this will in turn erode trust in government and politics more widely. “It is simply not enough that the scheme is now closed and a small number of oligarchs sanctioned; politicians and the public alike must be able to understand the findings of the report and learn the lessons.” The closure of the scheme in February was welcomed across parliament, although MPs have expressed security concerns related to those granted the visas. Spotlight on Corruption said last year that 6,312 golden visas – half of all such visas ever issued – were being reviewed for possible national security risks. The Home Office was approached for comment.",News/News,"Name the eight oligarchs given ‘golden visas’, demands Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/10/name-the-eight-oligarchs-given-golden-visas-demands-labour
4/10/2022,"In August 2020, Alexei Navalny, Russian opposition leader and general thorn in the side of Vladimir Putin, was taken gravely ill on a flight home to Moscow from Siberia. An emergency landing saved him; Navalny was hospitalised and treated for what turned out to be poisoning with a nerve agent. He fled to Germany to recuperate in exile, and through an undercover investigation that could have been lifted from a political thriller, he and his team gradually pieced together the facts behind the assassination attempt that nearly claimed his life. Documentary film-maker Daniel Roher’s tenacious camera follows throughout. It’s a genuinely exciting piece of storytelling, a propulsive real-life quest for truth driven by ingenious tech-geeks and the disarming force of Navalny’s personality. Navalny is available in Curzon cinemas on 12 April for a special one-day event and will be available on demand followed by a UK wide release on 15 April",Arts/Film,Navalny review – extraordinary documentary about the attempt to kill Putin’s rival,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/navalny-review-alexei-extraordinary-documentary-assassination-attempt-poisoning
4/10/2022,"Organisations in the West Midlands have accused the Commonwealth Games of failing to engage with multicultural communities across the region. A number of groups claimed organisers of the sporting event, taking place in Birmingham in July, have ignored their requests to get involved, and said creative groups led by people of colour have been sidelined for the cultural festival running alongside the Games. “Birmingham is such a diverse city, we’ve got the whole of the Commonwealth here and they’ve missed that opportunity,” said Aftab Rahman, the director of Legacy West Midlands, a charity promoting migrant heritage and community wellbeing. “It’s a big thing for us as a city, it will put us on the international stage. But when they took the Games on, one of the biggest points was diversity. And it hasn’t happened.” Rahman was one of a number of signatories of an open letter to the Games published last month that claimed “Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities seem to have been sidestepped and major contributors to this local culture and business innovation ignored”. Martin Green, the chief creative officer of the Games, responded to the claims by saying: “While some of the fears being expressed are completely valid and understandable, I am really confident that at the end of the day, they will prove to be unfounded. Unfortunately, no matter what kind of funding you have, there’s always choices to be made.” He said the schedule of eventswas still a work in progress, and “anyone can go and look at the programme as it currently stands and see for themselves that it’s really reflective of this place”. Varun Singh, a programme manager at Sandwell and Birmingham Mela, the UK’s biggest south Asian music festival, which also signed the open letter, said: “We’ve engaged with them, we’ve been given lip service by the cultural team but often we’ve not heard back. It feels like we’ve been blanked out. We want to work together. It’s sad that we’ve had to shout about it like this. “But it’s not too late. Our doors are open. We are prepared to work with the cultural team.” He said the Mela had submitted a proposal to have a presence during the Games but had yet to hear back. Singh also said he had asked for a breakdown of the recipients of all creative grants and commissions from the Games to date, but organisers said that while they had “nothing to hide”, they would not be releasing the information until the events schedule was complete. Jatinder Singh, the president of Guru Nanak Gurdwara near the Sandwell aquatics centre – newly built for the event– said he had received “continuous negative responses” when trying to work with the Commonwealth Games, including inviting Perry, the event mascot, to visit. “It’s been very disheartening to be honest. The lack of response we’ve had has really put a dampener on it. It’s not that we want to cause any issues for the Games themselves, because it’s something that we’re proud of,” he said. “But we’re situated one mile from a multimillion-pound complex built for the Games. We would like to be involved more. “We have 10,000 people coming into our gurdwara every single week. I tell our congregation about the Games and what is happening, but how or why am I supposed to do that when the people who I’m promoting don’t want to know?” It is not the first time the event has come under fire over equality issues. It received heavy criticism in 2020 when it was revealed its entire team of executives were white, and all but one of the board of directors were also white. It responded by recruiting more diverse board members and hiring a head of equality. Commonwealth Games organisers said they had delivered 50 community hub events and 60 community roadshows, which had reached nearly 150,000 local residents, as well as running diversity and faith forums to consult with community representatives.",Sport/Sport,Commonwealth Games cultural festival accused of sidelining people of colour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/commonwealth-games-cultural-festival-accused-sidelining-people-of-colour
4/10/2022,"Amanda Piña’s Frontera is part of an ongoing project in which the Vienna-based, Mexican-Chilean choreographer delves into the backstories of endangered or marginalised human movements – in this case, a dance from the Mexican border town of Matamoros that mixes hip-hop and folkloric influences.Piña’s programme text and artistic discourse freights the performance with hefty theoretical cargo, but what matters more is the event itself, which took place on the top floor of a Leeds car park, set against a panorama of tall buildings and cottony clouds and with a chill air permeating the blankets under which we huddle.As the title suggests, the idea of the border is central, here manifesting most emphatically as the one separating actors from audience. The piece unfolds around one obsessively repeated loop: from the back, the eight performers approach the audience in slow but purposeful lines, their piercing gaze seeming to search for some horizon behind us. When they reach the front – that is, the fourth wall – they stop and turn back, only to advance again once they reach the back. With each cycle, they don different clothes from the wardrobe rails at the back, plain caps and sweatshirts becoming accessorised with tinselly carnival drapes, shamanic masks and bright skirts emblazoned with religious icons or national flags. Here, a woman crawls like cat; there, a man wrestles with a ribbon-like snake and then, spine swaying, seems to become a serpent himself. While images and associations proliferate, every step of the dance lands exactly upon the drumbeat – an insistent pulse that unites the bodies of these multicoloured, polymorphous people.Unexpectedly, a live drummer appears and the work takes a different turn. No longer acting out their cumulative loops, the cast dance in fiery formation, their whirling and stamping steps still always landing exactly on the battering beat, however irregular and wrong-footing its rhythms. It’s a sudden but sustained blast of energy that leaves us buzzing – as if the spirit, if not the bodies of the performers, had finally breached the border separating us from them. We descend through the car park back into the streets of Leeds feeling weirdly dislocated, definitely cold and much enlivened.",Arts/Stage,Frontera | Border – a Living Monument review – polymorphous dance enlivens cold Leeds car park,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/10/frontera-border-a-living-monument-amanda-pina-review-victoria-multistorey-car-park-leeds
4/10/2022,"There are rocks just below the surface of the Adriatic where teenager Julija (Gracija Filipović) and her parents live, above a cove on the Croatian coast. At low tide these rocks are a jutting underbite, ready to chew chunks out of passing yachts. Julija’s overbearing father, Ante (Leon Lučev), knows this, but defiantly pilots his boat through anyway. Then he pushes his daughter overboard for questioning his decision. It’s a telling moment in Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović’s sinewy family drama, in which threats to domestic equilibrium – Ante’s simmering anger, his wife Nela’s (Danica Curcic) secrets – lurk just out of view. Tensions are already high between Julija and her father: they dive to spear fish together in harmony, but are at loggerheads when they reach the land. The discord is amplified by the arrival of Javi (Cliff Curtis), a wealthy friend of the family. The atmosphere, of sun and celebration, rings as hollow as the Europop that Ante blasts to drown out arguments; sonar-stabs of cello on the score sound a warning.",Arts/Film,Murina review – simmering drama on the Croatian coast,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/10/murina-review-antoneta-alamat-kusijanovic-simmering-croatian-drama
4/10/2022,"In the foyer of the Comédie-Française in Paris stands a glass box, almost 2 metres tall and rather more than 1 metre wide. In the box stands a chair, its wooden arms protruding, skeleton-like, through battered stuffing and ancient cloth – or is it leather? It’s too worn to tell. In this chair, on 17 February 1673, France’s greatest comic playwright was carried from the stage for the last time, having been taken ill while playing the title role in his final comedy, Le Malade Imaginaire. He died not many minutes later (Molière would have appreciated Spike Milligan’s self-penned epitaph: “I told you I was ill”). In the marble and glass pomp of its surroundings, the chair appears ludicrous, yet packs a powerful emotional punch. I don’t know whether to laugh or cry. This crazy, comic/tragic bit of furniture is the physical expression of the invisible link across time between the playwright and this theatre – still sometimes referred to as “the House of Molière”. It also hints at the complex relationship between the institution and the plays, between the need to preserve tradition, and to keeping the plays themselves alive for contemporary audiences. We have no equivalent in the UK. For better or for worse, our direct connection with Shakespeare, our closest equivalent, was ruptured when the Puritans closed the London theatres in 1642 (they did not officially reopen until 1660, two years after Molière became established in Paris under the protection of “Monsieur”, Louis XIV). Given this history, it’s a bit of a surprise to read the words of the theatre’s general administrator, Éric Ruf (himself an award-winning performer, director and designer): “If there is a theatre where no one knows the best way to stage Molière, this is it.” It’s a bold statement at a time when the Comédie-Française is going all out to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the baptism of Jean-Baptiste Poquelin, who would later rename himself Molière. Through until 25 July, the company’s repertoire will be devoted entirely to the playwright, with 20 plays by or relating to him (12 among them entirely new productions), as well as associated talks, online links, broadcasts and exhibitions, including one with the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Ruf goes on to clarify by saying that each of 1,000 different productions may find something new in Molière, and that the best way to approach the work is by accepting that there are no fixed rules: “We must dare to continue to explore all directions, whether they turn out to be rich or threadbare, revolutionary or childish, clear or obscure, on-target or off-course.” This openness to innovation and risk-taking characterises Ruf’s programming for the Molière 2022 season. Naturally, he cannot please all the people all of the time: some regret that not all the chosen directors are French; Parisians, in particular, complain that productions have sold out even before they opened (although if you head to the theatre a little more than an hour in advance of curtain up, you can join a queue and hope to pick up a return). I was fortunate to be given two press tickets and to be near enough the head of the returns queue to pick up a third. Each of the three productions, all in Molière’s original French, illustrated Ruf’s position, taking its own unique approach. The Belgian director Ivo van Hove is perhaps best known in the UK for his production of Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler for the National Theatre, also screened to cinemas in 2017. Ruf entrusted to him the company’s flagship production, a Molière play never yet produced on the Comédie-Française stage: the three-act 1664 version of Le Tartuffe ou l’Hypocrite, which was banned by Louis XIV. As reconstructed by the theatre historian Georges Forestier, the original is darker than the later, rewritten five-act version. The Le Monde critic described Van Hove’s production as “choc et chic”. It is shocking in its violence and trendy in its lack of playfulness. As an examination of the perversions of hypocrisy, it’s remarkable (Christophe Montenez’s interpretation of the title role is flesh-creepingly mesmerising). As an interpretation of Molière, though, it seems to take too seriously Goethe’s observation about the closeness of his comedies to tragedy. By contrast, the Swiss performer and director Lilo Baur, a former member of Complicité, offers a new production of L’Avare (The Miser), set in postwar Switzerland, that is poster-paint bright and farce-focused. Crammed with gimmicky gags, it tries too hard to be funny, and only raises laughs when it lets Molière’s situations alone to be themselves. Between these two in tone, and the most successful of the three, is the revived 2014 production of Le Misanthrope, directed by the Comédie’s own Clément Hervieu-Léger (and designed by Ruf). Here, the emphasis tends towards a Chekhovian naturalism. Loïc Corbery’s extremist Alceste is as much tortured lover as he is misanthrope, stubbornly and self-damagingly resisting the moderating logic of his friend Philinte (Éric Génovèse) and the appeal to tenderness of Adeline d’Hermy’s spirited, flirtatious Célimène. Violence, viciousness, love and consideration kaleidoscope through the action, the whole tempered with laughter. The one constant through all three productions is the quality of the acting. The benefits of a troupe structure to individuals and to the ensemble are apparent: thrilling performances. I go to take my leave of the famous chair. Impossible to see it: a group of schoolchildren bustle round the glass box, talking, laughing. The past and the future of the Comédie-Française is an ongoing conversation. Le Tartuffe ou l’Hypocrite is at the Comédie-Française until 24 April; L’Avare runs until 24 July; Le Misanthrope until 22 May.
