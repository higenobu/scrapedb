5/19/2022,"A33-year-old woman in El Salvador who suffered a medical emergency while pregnant has been freed after serving a decade in jail for attempted murder, the victim of a draconian abortion ban being replicated in the US. The woman, named only as Jacqueline, sought medical help for an obstetric complication in 2011, and even though the baby survived, she was arrested on suspicion of attempted abortion. She was separated from her newborn daughter and eight-year-old son, and sentenced to 15 years for attempted murder. Jacqueline, who was released on Wednesday, is the 65th woman to be freed having been wrongly jailed on murder charges following a miscarriage or other obstetric emergency since the total ban on abortion came into force in 1998. The Salvadorian anti-abortion law, which was subsequently written into the constitution, has led to at least 182 women who suffered an obstetric emergency being prosecuted for abortion or aggravated homicide. Poor, young, women from rural areas with limited access to healthcare have been disproportionately persecuted, with most reported to the police by hospital workers. In many cases, prosecutors and judges have argued that the woman’s failure to save the pregnancy amounted to murder. Salvadorian lawyers and activists have worked to free the convicted women, pursuing pardons, sentence reduction and access to education and work programs that can lead to an early release. Ten women have been freed since last December, leaving three still in prison. Each case has taken a sustained campaign of protests, public health efforts and media pressure, according to Morena Herrera, a reproductive rights campaigner who recalls the moment when lawmakers, spurred on by the religious right, voted to ban abortion without exception in April 1997. “I warned them that this law would end the presumption of innocence for pregnant women, which is exactly what happened. It’s this same risk that the US is now facing,” said Herrera. A leaked supreme court decision suggests that Roe vs Wade – the 1973 ruling which guarantees the right to abortion – will soon be overturned, resulting in about half of US states banning or severely restricting access to safe legal abortion. Texas and Oklahoma have already approved severe restrictions. Herrera added: “Don’t let our reality become your reality. If the law changes, doctors’ hands will be tied and women will die. Do everything you can to stop this because the consequences of losing access to abortion are grave.” In El Salvador, a country of 6.5 million people, the consequences include death for women with ectopic pregnancies who have been denied timely medical care. Many others have suffered complications to their physical and mental health. Suicide rates among young pregnant women have risen. Last week advocates were dismayed when Esme, a 28-year-old from a poor rural community, was sentenced to 30 years for aggravated homicide after suffering a miscarriage – the first woman convicted for an obstetric complication in seven years. “We are in shock, maybe we didn’t put enough pressure. You can never take your foot off the pedal,” said Paula Ávila-Guillén, a human rights lawyer and executive director of the New York-based Women’s Equality Centre. Esme spent two years in jail on remand, but is currently at home while lawyers appeal the verdict. The battle to free the three other women continues. María del Rosario was 23 years old when she started haemorrhaging at home alone. Instead of receiving medical help, she was detained by police and sentenced to 30 years for aggravated homicide (later reduced to 20 years). María del Rosario’s pregnancy was the result of rape; her alleged aggressor was acquitted. She has spent a decade in prison. Liliana was a 21-year-old mother expecting her second baby in 2016 when she was sentenced to 30 years in jail for homicide after suffering a medical emergency. The sentence was later halved, but she has already spent seven years separated from her daughter. The case of Bertha Arana is especially egregious. Arana, 28, was convicted of attempted murder in 2012 after suffering a medical emergency, even though her daughter survived. But unlike Jacqueline, every attempt to secure a reduction in her 30-year sentence has been blocked because Arana was born just over the border in Guatemala and does not have Salvadorian identity papers. She has not seen her daughter since giving birth. “Bertha’s case is not just unjust, it’s cruel,” said Herrera. The UN has condemned such cases as arbitrary detentions. As the US contemplates the reality of a post-Roe world, the Salvadorian experience demonstrates the long-term impact on women who are criminalised. Cristina Quintanilla was 18 and excited about motherhood when she suffered a late miscarriage in 2005. She woke up handcuffed to a hospital bed, and was given 30 years for aggravated murder, though was released after serving four after a sentence review. Vilified as a “baby killer” in El Salvador, Quintanilla was unable to find work and in 2014 made it to the US where she sought asylum. She’s been in legal limbo ever since, waiting for an immigration judge to rule on the case, but was denied a work visa because of her criminal record. “The injustice continues, I can’t escape it. I’m so tired of fighting to clear my name, to be given an opportunity to live my life,” said Quintanilla, 36. “It’s very unfortunate what’s happening here. Americans face a very uncertain future, it will be chaos.” The US backslide comes amid a wave of legal and political reproductive rights victories across Latin America improving access to safe abortion from women in countries such as Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Argentina. Ávila-Guillén, who works with lawyers and activists across Latin America, said they had learned lessons from the erosion of abortion rights in the US. “We realised that human rights standards and legal strategy would never be enough, we also needed mass mobilizations, activism, political work and a communication strategy, and that’s what the US will need to do to win hearts and minds and get our rights back.”",News/World news,Abortion: El Salvador’s jailed women offer US glimpse of post-Roe future,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/abortion-el-salvador-jailed-women-roe-v-wade
5/19/2022,"It was little more than a year ago that US officials were publicly rubbishing the prospect of engagement with Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, who they described as a “dictator”. “His repression, corruption and mismanagement have generated one of the most dire humanitarian crises this hemisphere has seen,” the state department spokesperson, Ned Price, declared in February 2021. “We certainly don’t expect any contact with Maduro anytime soon.” Yet 2022 appears to have heralded a new dawn for Washington-Caracas ties, as geopolitical shifts caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and political deadlock in the economically devastated South American country prompt a major policy rethink from members of Joe Biden’s administration – and offer Venezuela’s authoritarian leader a once improbable political lifeline. On Tuesday, the US announced a gentle easing of the economic sanctions it has spent years using to push for political change in Venezuela – including against a nephew of its first lady – a move senior members of Maduro’s government celebrated. “Venezuela hopes that these decisions by the United States of America will pave the way to the total lifting of the illegal sanctions which affect our entire people,” the country’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, tweeted in English as the news emerged. Simultaneously, her brother, another top Chavista called Jorge Rodríguez, shared a photograph of himself shaking hands with the chief negotiator for Venezuela’s opposition, Gerardo Blyde, signalling the reactivation of stalled talks designed to bridge the country’s toxic political schism. “Congratulations!” tweeted Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister of Mexico, where those negotiations were happening until their suspension last October after the extradition of the Maduro ally Alex Saab to the US. Some see Washington’s change of heart as a direct consequence of Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. In March, days after Russia’s onslaught began, senior US officials flew to Caracas for their first encounter with Maduro representatives in years. That visit was partly motivated by a US desire to increase oil production in Venezuela – which boasts the world’s largest proven reserves – in order to restrain global oil prices, which have soared as a result of Putin’s war. Christopher Sabatini, a Chatham House Latin America expert, said the war in Ukraine had also prompted a rethink in Caracas, which desperately needed new markets for its oil as well as access to western refineries, banking systems and investment. “It’s true that oil prices have gone up with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but, because of sanctions, Russia is now increasing the sale of its oil to China, which was Venezuela’s principal market,” he added. Yet Sabatini believed Washington’s shift had been planned well before Putin’s invasion and reflected the US’s realization that the Trump-era “maximum pressure” policy – by which harsh sanctions were used to try to topple Maduro and replace him with the young opposition leader Juan Guaidó – had failed. “It is a demonstration that the US and much of the international community bet on a solution that simply hasn’t worked,” Sabatini said. “That’s anathema to some people in the US Congress. It’s anathema to some elements of the Venezuelan opposition who always hoped and dreamed for some sort of cathartic collapse of the government and the fleeing of Maduro and his cronies. But clearly Maduro has hung on, [albeit] at a huge cost to his country … and now the US has to [engage].” Representatives of Venezuela’s mainstream opposition, and the rival government Guaidó created when his campaign to unseat Maduro started in January 2019, now accept dealing with their foe is the only way forwards as the country heads towards its next scheduled presidential election in 2024. Speaking to the Guardian during a recent tour of Europe, Guaidó’s deputy foreign minister, Isadora Zubillaga, admitted: “The reality is that we must talk. We were not able to wipe them out and they were not able to wipe us out either. That negotiation process must include discussion of the lifting of sanctions and penalties.” However, Zubillaga warned the west against boosting what she called a Putin-led autocratic coalition by offering too many concessions to Maduro. “The Maduro regime is sustained by the international alliance, including countries like Iran, Russia, Cuba and China. If Maduro is helped, so is Putin,” Zubillaga said. A senior US administration official said that it would calibrate its sanctions policy depending on the behaviour of Maduro’s administration and whether “ambitious, concrete and irreversible” steps towards free and democratic elections were achieved at talks. Members of the US right denounced the loosening of sanctions, which include allowing limited contact between the US oil giant Chevron and Venezuela’s government. “Biden continues his effort to appease anti-American communist dictators,” tweeted the Republican senator Marco Rubio, one of the cheerleaders for Trump’s bungled anti-Maduro drive. A Wall Street Journal editorial slammed Biden’s “dance with a Latin dictator”. Others expressed cautious optimism that, while there would be no overnight solutions to Venezuela’s profound economic, humanitarian and political crises, the return of negotiations – and incentives for Maduro and others around him to offer concessions – was a step towards a democratic transition. Geoff Ramsey, the director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, said: “The only feasible transition is a pacted transition which is going to require some level of negotiations with political, military and economic elites. “What we are seeing is a recognition of that reality. I don’t think that means that the US or other actors of the international community are ignorant or naive about the difficulties that lie ahead,” he added. “If the problem in Venezuela were simply a lack of dialogue we would have seen the crisis solved years ago.”",News/World news,Maduro glimpses political lifeline as US rethinks Venezuela policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-us-relations
5/19/2022,"Royal Mail has warned that the company is at a “crossroads” and needs to urgently adapt to the post-pandemic environment as parcel deliveries, originally boosted by Covid lockdowns, continue to wane. It piles further pressure on the postal company, as it struggles to reach a pay deal with unionised staff who are pushing for an inflation-based pay rise as the cost of living soars. Royal Mail said on Thursday it suffered an 8.8% drop in annual pre-tax profits to £662m, explaining that revenues were flat as the easing of Covid restrictions reduced demand for parcel deliveries. The drop was partially offset by the distribution of Covid test kits, but overall, parcel demand across the UK fell 7% year-on-year. Chairman Keith Williams admitted that the financial tailwinds of the pandemic “are now dissipating” and that the company was steeling itself for a drop in economic growth and higher inflation that could pose challenges for both its UK and international delivery business. “We are at a crossroads with the transformation of Royal Mail,” he said. “We need to adapt our business to a post-pandemic world and whilst we are making progress in some areas, more needs to be done in others”. The news sent shares down nearly 10% on Thursday morning, wiping nearly £400m off the company’s value and making Royal Mail the biggest faller on the FTSE 100. The courier also faces an ongoing pay claim with staff represented by the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which said Royal Mail’s full-year profits were “earned off the backs of our members hard work”. BREAKING 📰 : Royal Mail Group announce huge profits of £758mThis profit was earned off the backs of our members hard work.RT if you back a no strings attached pay rise for postal workers. “Every single penny of the £758m [adjusted operating] profit was from letter, parcel and test kits collected, processed, distributed and delivered by key postal workers, not by board members and not by shareholders but by our members,” said Terry Pullinger, the CWU’s deputy secretary general. “It is an outstanding effort delivered during unprecedented times from key workers…The CWU are immensely proud of our members and even more determined than ever to get the the reward, recognition and pay rise that these results prove they deserve.” The company has so far offered a 3.5% pay rise for workers, with the potential for a further 2% rise for workers who reach certain productivity targets. However, the union is understood to be seeking an inflation-based pay rise with “no strings attached”. Figures released on Wednesday showed that UK inflation hit 9% in April, its highest level for more than 40 years, following a surge in food, energy and transport costs. A Royal Mail spokesperson said it wanted to reach an agreement with the CWU as soon as possible. “Our industry is characterised by a race to the bottom on pay and terms and conditions. We will not join that race and will retain our place as the industry leader on pay and terms and conditions. We value the work we do with CWU and remain committed to agreeing a deal.” ",News/Business,Royal Mail ‘at crossroads’ as pandemic parcel boom fades,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/royal-mail-at-crossroads-as-pandemic-parcel-boom-fades
5/19/2022,"As the libel suit between Rebekah Vardy and Coleen Rooney rumbles on in the high court, the public has heard weeks of claims and counterclaims about Instagram stings, paparazzi ambushes and phones lost in the sea. But one thing has been clear from the outset: one of the two women has been betrayed. Either, as Rooney claims, Vardy sold stories about her fellow Wag to the Sun, or, as Vardy maintains, Rooney’s baseless accusation has dragged her good name through the mud. It is a messy and sordid tale from which no one – except possibly the lawyers – emerges the better. Rooney has described Vardy’s WhatsApp exchanges about her as “evil”; Vardy has said that the threats and abuse she received after Rooney’s accusations made her feel suicidal. What is driving the former friends to spend millions airing their most intimate details? Betrayal by a friend is not something you can just laugh off, says Dr Jennifer Freyd, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon. “The very place where you should be able to get help and protection from the harms of life becomes the source of harm.” She coined the term “betrayal trauma” to describe the pain such treachery can cause. “We are a social species; when someone betrays us, it’s a real threat to our wellbeing.” There are degrees of betrayal, of course. Most of us will have experienced a friend gossiping uncharitably behind our backs, for example – or perhaps we have been that friend. This is hardly Judas kissing Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. “But what we find overall is that betrayal is toxic,” Freyd says. “People who are betrayed are likely to have physical and mental health challenges.” Annabel, who is in her 50s and lives in Wales, was betrayed by her former friend Jane. They met in the early 2000s. Annabel ran a specialist business at a food market; Jane visited her stand often and befriended her at a marketing event. “We just clicked,” says Annabel. “She was really friendly. We’d go to each other’s houses for meals.” Annabel introduced Jane to her friends and gave her work on her stall, teaching her all about her business. Jane then announced that she planned to set up a rival stand, selling the same products at the same market. Annabel was horrified. “I told her that I was hurt and I thought it would be awkward and strange for other people,” says Annabel. “It didn’t work personally and from a business point of view we were going to be sharing customers.” Jane was unmoved, even suggesting that, if Annabel was unhappy, she might like to consider moving markets. Just like that, their friendship was over. At first, Jane’s stand didn’t affect Annabel’s sales too greatly, but over time her income declined. “The market could not sustain two similar businesses,” she says. Eventually, Annabel left. The experience made her feel “very lonely – like I couldn’t trust anyone. I felt that people might just be after what I had got.” She was, she says, “upset for a very long time”. This is a common response to feelings of betrayal, says Holly Roberts, a psychotherapist with the relationship charity Relate. “When you open up to a friend, you make yourself vulnerable to that person,” she says. “That’s what makes it hard. Because you’ve bared yourself emotionally to that person and been hurt by them.” Roberts says these feelings “can sit with you for a long time”. Annabel has moved on with her life. “I can be philosophical about it now,” she says. “But it ranks pretty highly in my history of painful personal experiences.” Betrayal stories “are as old as time”, notes Dr Lucy CMM Jackson, an assistant classics professor at Durham University. Tales such as Euripides’ Medea, about a woman’s bloody quest for vengeance after her husband abandons her, “are so fascinating because they articulate a fear”, she says. “We tell stories about betrayal to make sense of it, in the hope that maybe we can avoid it or, if not, be better prepared for it. Ultimately, we come back to the idea of betrayal so often because we do have to trust each other.” Medea “takes vengeance because her name has been dragged through the dust”, says Jackson. Does she see parallels with Vardy’s attempt to restore her reputation? “It’s all quite petty,” she says. “I don’t get the sense that so much honour has been given up in this modern parallel.” Like Medea, Stacy Thunes’ story of betrayal revolves around a duplicitous lover. Thunes, a 61-year-old actor and screenwriter from London, was betrayed by her close friend Billie in the early 80s. When Thunes fell in love with a handsome musician, she arranged for the three of them to go for breakfast. At breakfast, to Thunes’ horror, “his foot was actually touching hers under the table”, she says. That evening, Thunes went to Billie’s apartment. The lights were off and Billie wasn’t answering the doorbell. Thunes climbed in through an open window. Billie emerged from her bedroom. “I knew by the look on her face that he was there,” Thunes says. Being betrayed by Billie, she says, was more painful than being betrayed by her boyfriend. “It made me feel like we were never really friends,” says Thunes. “Like the friendship meant nothing. All those years of feeling that she had my back were gone in an instant.” Those who are betrayed often feel shame, says Roberts. “People feel embarrassed. They think: how could I have opened myself up to this person and let them do this to me? How could I have been so naive?” Lisa, a disability support worker, knows this feeling well. “I couldn’t believe how stupid we’d been,” she sighs. Lisa met Anna in the 1990s when they worked in adjacent shops in Edinburgh. “She was funny and kind and generous,” says Lisa. “You knew where you stood with her. I liked that.” When Lisa and her then-husband moved to a small village on the east coast of Scotland, Anna soon followed with her young son. Lisa helped out with childcare and even acted as a guarantor on her rental property. “She was my family and I was hers,” says Lisa. But everything fell apart when Anna’s landlord got in touch. Anna had fallen behind on the rent. Lisa offered to lend her £1,500, the last of a small legacy her grandfather had left her. “She initially said no, but eventually agreed,” says Lisa. “I gave her the money in cash. And that was the last time I ever saw her.” Eventually, Lisa pieced together the story: Anna had used her money to run away with a boyfriend. “I felt more angry at myself than at her, for being so naive,” Lisa says. Anna later wrote a letter to Lisa, apologising for hurting her – but not for taking the money. “She said it was my fault, because I forced her to do it,” says Lisa. Not everyone will get the closure that comes with an apology, however half-hearted. Cormac and Duncan met a decade ago as teachers at the same school. They became friends quickly and Cormac introduced Duncan to his social and professional circles. When a management post became available, Cormac asked Duncan if he planned to apply for it. “He said no,” Cormac says. “I would have had no problem if he’d said yes.” Cormac spent weeks going over his interview strategy with Duncan. At his interview, he was stunned to see Duncan there, in a suit and tie. “He’d gleaned all the information from me and he’d used me to lay the groundwork for getting to know everyone on the panel,” says Cormac. Duncan got the job. “I was in tears, because I knew I’d been dealing with someone very clever and manipulative and careful, and it was devastating.” To make matters more maddening, Duncan not only never apologised, but also spread false rumours about Cormac around the school. “I had to find my own resolution,” says Cormac. “I can’t let him live in my head rent-free. I told myself: ‘That is in the past and everything from here on out will be good.’” Cormac ended up moving to a different school. “I wanted to draw a line under it,” he says. Betrayal usually means the end of a friendship. “That urge to withdraw is a protective response,” says Freyd. “You don’t want to continue to be betrayed. It’s analogous to a fight-or-flight response.” After Billie wrote to beg for forgiveness, Thunes let her back into her life, but she never trusted her again. “Every time I was with someone, I knew she might have her eye on them,” says Thunes. It is possible to rebuild the relationship “if you’re both invested in it”, says Roberts. “Check in with each other: how does this feel? But the trust may never come back. Accepting that can be a good step.” If you feel unable to trust your friend, walk away. “You don’t have to put yourself through it,” she says. “Some things can’t be repaired, and it’s OK to acknowledge that.” Surprisingly few of the betrayed wish harm upon their betrayers. They would rather let go of the hurt and move on. “I couldn’t let it drive me mad,” says Annabel. “I had to carry on doing my thing.” But all of them are more careful now; more tentative about who they let in, more thoughtful about what they do with the trust that others place in them. “I am reminded of it daily, not because I want to make myself feel bad, but because I don’t want to be that person to hurt other people,” says Thunes. But the act of continuing to trust after being hurt so badly is a form of resistance in itself. They will not stop connecting with others, because to close off from the world is to let their betrayers win. Lisa says she would lend Anna the money again in a heartbeat, even knowing everything she does now. “I’ve had so much kindness shown to me over the years, too,” she says. “That’s what makes life beautiful.” Some names have been changed",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Some things can’t be repaired’: how do you recover when a friend betrays you?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/19/how-do-you-recover-when-a-friend-betrays-you
5/19/2022,"The repeal of federally protected abortion rights would result in an increase in violence experienced by Indigenous women, girls and all those who birth, predicted the director of one of the leading research institutes on Indigenous and Alaska Native people across the US. “The only option we have right now if this was to be overturned, is to provide the limited resources and support, but it will be limited, especially initially. As a direct result our people are going to suffer,” Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute, told the Guardian. Her remarks followed a leaked supreme court draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito that showed the country’s highest court ready to overturn Roe v Wade, the nearly 50-year-old ruling protecting the right to an abortion until a fetus is viable outside the womb. Should that decision become official, 13 states with trigger laws would immediately in effect outlaw abortions. Many other Republican-controlled states are expected to follow suit. A 2016 National Institute of Justice study found that more than one in three Indigenous and Alaska Native women had experienced violence in the past year, including sexual violence and violence by an intimate partner. They were 1.7 times more likely than white women to be the victims of violence. They are also at an especially high risk for being trafficked, although comprehensive data is limited. The high rates of these crimes – many of which are never reported, probably due to a mistrust in law enforcement – compounded with not being able to access legal abortions, can leave Indigenous people at an increased risk, explained Echo-Hawk. For those in an abusive relationship, not having access to an abortion could force the victim to stay in a bad situation and lead to more violence, she said. Those being trafficked, some of whom are not allowed to use birth control, may face additional violence from their perpetrators should they become pregnant. Indigenous and Alaska Native women along with Black women are also two to three times more likely to die as a result of their pregnancy than white women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Echo-Hawk said having to access unsafe abortions or experiencing the mental anguish of being forced to go through a pregnancy could increase these numbers. “That mental health and the mental violence which we’re experiencing, that has a direct impact on a person’s body when they are going through pregnancy, and it can directly result in pre-term birth and maternal mortality as a direct result,” she said. “So, we’re actually battling mental violence that continues to be perpetuated against us.” For decades Indigenous people were subjected to forced sterilization in the US, with the practice peaking in the mid-20th century. Repealing Roe v Wade would shift the scales of their reproductive autonomy – or lack thereof – to a new and dire extreme, explained Kerri Colfer, senior Native affairs adviser for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center. “Native people are still dealing with the trauma of colonization, historic violence against Native people, forced sterilizations, Indian child removal and boarding schools … being forced to carry pregnancy is a really traumatic thing, whether that is a pregnancy that resulted from assault or not. And now we’ll have another generation with that trauma to carry on,” she said. The Indian Health Service provides health care to about 2.6 million Indigenous and Alaska Natives. But the agency, which is within the US Department of Health and Human Services, restricts abortions to those in which a mother’s life is at risk or in cases of rape or incest that have been reported within 60 days. Echo-Hawk, who was an author of an amicus brief submitted to the supreme court on this issue last year, said as part of that effort, her organization looked at 33 IHS-funded facilities. They found that between 2002 and 2021, only seven Indigenous women were documented as visiting an IHS facility for an abortion. Instead, some Indigenous people seek abortions outside these facilities, she explained. Repealing Roe v Wade would mean that Indigenous people, some of whom live in extremely rural and poverty-stricken areas, might have to travel much further, to facilities outside their state. She asked: “How are we going to afford that travel?” Since 2014, Indigenous Women Rising, an Indigenous-led and -centered reproductive justice organization, has helped hundreds through its abortion fund by contributing funding for the procedure, as well as for gas, hotels and childcare. Rachael Lorenzo, its executive director, said if Roe v Wade is overturned, they will need to keep close track of the abortion policies in the states they serve the most, including North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona and Oklahoma, and willprobably need more funds. The organization has several fundraising events scheduled, including a barbecue cookout for rural communities in southern New Mexico and a two-stepping fundraiser. “People are scared, and they’re angry, and they’re frustrated. And so am I,” said Lorenzo, a descendant of Mescalero Apache, Laguna Pueblo and Xicana. “But we also deserve joy. And if there’s any way we can merge the two, by taking action and not letting ourselves get consumed with how scary this is … that’s really where our energy is going to be.”",News/US news,Indigenous and Alaska Native women could face escalated violence if Roe is repealed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/roe-v-wade-indigenous-women-increase-violence

5/19/2022,"It was Labor costings day – and the party took a gamble with a pledge to deepen the deficit in order to invest in productive measures such as childcare. Scott Morrison demonstrated his bulldozer persona at a press conference, while one of his ministers blamed both sides for Wednesday’s tackle of a child playing soccer. And the government seized on new data showing unemployment had dropped to 3.9%, the lowest in decades. Two sleeps to go: here’s how Thursday unfolded. By Josh Butler Labor promised a “final sprint” of marginal seats until election day, but it started with a stumble after the opposition initially planned to send Anthony Albanese to campaign in Brisbane while his travelling press pack was sent to Canberra. The decision was met with fury on the campaign bus, with journalists upset at being split up from the prospective PM less than 48 hours from polls opening. The decision was quickly reversed after reporters threatened to boycott Albanese’s morning press events, with some media types claiming it was an unprecedented plan. The bus went to Brisbane to see him hit marginal seats. A mutiny averted, Albanese held another visit to a childcare centre in the marginal Sydney seat of Bennelong, joining kids as they painted. He asked a young girl what he should paint – she thought for a moment, replying “a big, big, big bear”. Albanese responded “I’m going to draw a bunny rabbit”, whipping out a quick depiction (if hardly an impressionistic masterpiece) of his footy team’s mascot.

A flock of squawking cockatoos overhead interrupted Albanese’s press conference as he talked up his record of transparency and media appearances against Morrison’s for comparison. Earlier he’d doubled down on last night’s criticism of the Coalition for making “fun of someone’s name in their advertising”, criticising the government’s main attack ads. After making the claim in an address to an Italian community event in Sydney, he repeated it in TV interviews and the presser, claiming the rhetoric “bothers members of the community”. It was a criticism Morrison shrugged off, calling Albanese “precious”. Hopping up to Brisbane, Albanese held an event before his press bus even got there, meeting with QLD premier Annastacia Palaszczuk at a pre-poll booth.

He then held a quick presser in a nearby park to comment on Labor’s costings, which were announced in Canberra while he was on the road. Albanese said his extra $7.4bn in spending wouldn’t be inflationary because the money – for reforms like childcare – “will produce a return that produces economic activity”. He denied his campaign was “worried”, spruiking his visit to numerous Coalition-held marginal seats in attempts to win new MPs. “I’ll see you in other non-held seats tomorrow across three states,” Albanese said. By Paul Karp Scott Morrison started the day at a tennis club in the tiny town of Whitemore in the Labor-held seat of Lyons (Tasmania). Morrison had a hit of tennis with the Liberal candidate, Susie Bower, and a few children – another non-contact sport that this time, fortunately for all, involved no contact. Court-side and in numerous radio spots, Morrison said he’d spoken to Luca Fauvette, the young soccer star he had bowled over in Devonport on Wednesday, and confirmed that he was OK. “He came off better than I did,” Morrison said, eager to stress he landed on his shoulder (not Luca). Q: are you still going to have a tennis court after Saturday, Mr Morrison?PM: I hope so! Although I dont get too much time to use it.#auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/wyjZ6IsYqB The next stop was Island Block and Paving, also in Lyons, where Morrison confirmed he would make a trip to Solomon Islands if re-elected, and faced a barrage of questions about the cost of living. Confusion mounted about Morrison’s attempted self-reinvention, as he told 2SM being a bulldozer “helps get stuff done” and proceeded to bulldoze through numerous media questions asking about real wage cuts and what, if anything, he had really changed. After visits to Braddon and Lyons, Morrison did not drop in on the most marginal Tasmanian seat of Bass, where MP Bridget Archer has rebranded to use the colour purple, de-emphasising the Liberal party in her bid for re-election. Instead, he flew to Sydney and went to Carnes Hill, south-west Sydney, in the Labor-held seat of Werriwa (5.5%). Morrison did a second presser to boast about the unemployment rate – something he didn’t do after Wednesday’s dismal wages figures. A “multicultural afternoon tea” in the community centre turned into more of a rally for Liberal candidate Sam Kayal. Numerous young Liberals in blue shirts, shouts of “vote for Sam” and shouts of “shame” when Morrison spoke about unions wanting to control your superannuation rather gave away there weren’t many undecided voters there. Morrison was swamped for selfies, and then left to fly to Perth. Labor costings: Labor says the party’s decision to post $7.4bn in higher deficits than forecast over the next four years was not “made lightly”, but the spending is necessary to grow the economy. As he released the costings on Thursday, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said Labor had been through the budget carefully to identify savings to offset most of its proposed spending, which it has emphasised will help boost productivity. Pandemic powers: Experts have denounced a “totally misleading” claim perpetuated by government MPs and the United Australia party that the World Health Organization will use a possible pandemic treaty to control Australia’s health system, including to arbitrarily impose lockdowns. Taking stock: It’s been a marathon campaign but the finish line is in sight. Over the past couple of months Guardian Australia reporters have fanned out in marginal seats to try to capture the mood and dynamics of the 2022 election. The result of this exercise has been the illuminating Anywhere But Canberra series. Jingle jangle: This week, as the campaign period draws to a close, we asked Dr Andrew Hughes, a political marketing lecturer at the Australian National University, and the University of Canberra’s Dr Chris Wallace, to talk about the best and the worst advertisements of this election. Both swiftly picked the one they hated the most: the Coalition’s holey bucket. But will it work? There was a high five afterwards, so it was just an error from both of them. – Government frontbencher Stuart Robert describing on ABC Radio National Scott Morrison’s accidental knocking down of a young child while playing soccer.

5/19/2022,"The outgoing head of Australia’s offshore oil and gas regulator has helped hand out awards to fossil fuel companies, including Santos, Inpex and Beach Energy, prompting criticism the body could be seen as “too close” to industry. Stuart Smith, chief executive of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema), attended an industry conference dinner in Brisbane on Wednesday and assisted in handing out environmental and safety awards. The “environmental project excellence” award was given to Inpex for its oil spill response model and Beach Energy for a 3D seismic survey of marine life in the Bass Strait. Santos received a safety project excellence award for its road safety program. The dinner was part of the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) conference. Ian Davies, chair of Appea and chief executive of oil and gas company Senex Energy, praised Smith and thanked him for his work as the head of the regulator. Mark Ogge, principal advisor at The Australia Institute, was at the event and said he was “shocked” the regulator “felt comfortable” making the appearance and that it could be perceived as being “cosy” with industry. “Regulators being too close to the industry and their lobbyists is a classic indicator of industry capture,” Ogge said. “The regulator is meant to be making tough decisions that may be against the commercial interests of oil and gas companies in order to protect the community and the environment. “They’re meant to be the cop on the beat.” A spokesperson for the regulator said Nopsema “has a function to promote and advise on health and safety, as well as integrity and environmental management matters” and that its representatives routinely appeared at industry functions. “NOPSEMA’s CEO Stuart Smith announced publicly in March that he would not be seeking to have his contract renewed when it expires in September this year,” they said in a statement. “In light of this, he was contacted by APPEA and asked to attend the conference dinner so that his work over the last eight years could be acknowledged. “He was also asked to hand out some awards while he was on stage. He had no role in the selection of the award winners.” The spokesperson said Smith’s attendance, which was paid for by Nopsema, was “not unusual” and that the regulator “does not accept invitations to events from individual titleholders or companies”. Also in attendance at Wednesday’s dinner were the Western Australian deputy premier Roger Cook, the Queensland Liberal National party MPs Pat Weir and Trevor Watts, and the Labor MP James Madden. They were among numerous political leaders and dignitaries who have attended the conference since it began on Monday. The Norwegian ambassador to Australia, Paul Gulleik Larsen, was there for the opening of the conference on Tuesday, as was the former Coalition foreign minister Julie Bishop, who appeared on a panel with the former Labor foreign minister Stephen Smith. The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, also addressed the conference, saying the industry “could not be tied up by bureaucratic red tape” that would “[delay] construction timeframes, costing billions and endangering our energy security”. “This includes unnecessary regulation and things like scope three emissions,” Pitt said. “I’ll make our position on this very clear: take into account scope one and two emissions on projects but not scope three.” Scope three emissions are indirect emissions that occur up and down a company’s value chain, such as the burning of oil and gas by end consumers. Labor’s shadow resources minister, Madeleine King, appeared in a pre-recorded message on Thursday where she said the industry “absolutely” had a future and praised it for taking steps to decarbonise “long before the government”.",News/Australia news,Australia’s oil and gas regulator criticised after chief hands out environmental ‘excellence’ awards at industry dinner,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/australias-oil-and-gas-regulator-criticised-after-chief-hands-out-environmental-excellence-awards-at-industry-dinner
5/19/2022,"Tackling rising food and fuel bills will not add to inflation and people who are “the hardest hit” need help now, the head of the UK’s biggest business association has warned. Official figures published on Wednesday revealed UK inflation soared to 9% in April – its highest level for more than 40 years – as the rising cost of gas and electricity pushed household energy bills to record levels. Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “You have to help the hardest hit now. “Helping people with heating and eating bills will not fuel inflation. “You need to stimulate business investment now – that’s not going to overheat the economy. “It’s going to make sure that any downturn in our fortunes is short and shallow because growth is coming soon.” The Office for National Statistics said the 54% increase in the energy price cap in April, which took the average annual gas and electricity bill close to £2,000, was the main reason for the jump in the consumer prices index from 7% in March. Average petrol prices rose to a record 161.8p a litre in April 2022 from 125.5p a year earlier. Diesel was another factor behind the increase in the consumer price index from 7% in February after the average cost at the pumps hit a record high of 176.1p a litre, leading to an average increase over the last 12 months in motor fuels of 31.4%. Earlier, Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, said circumstances could warrant a windfall tax on oil and gas giants although the government was “intrinsically opposed” to such a tariff. The clamour for a one-off levy on the energy sector – which has made huge profits as gas prices surge – has been growing with Labour saying such a move is “inevitable”. Boris Johnson has repeatedly argued that a windfall tax would force companies to abandon investments in domestic energy projects, while the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has reportedly asked Treasury officials to examine plans for a levy. Malthouse, a longtime ally of Johnson’s, told Times Radio: “We are intrinsically opposed to that kind of taxation. We want to see a pattern of investment from that industry that will help us with our medium and long-term energy problems. “But the chancellor reserves the right to take all steps he thinks necessary and he’s in conversation with that industry all the time, I’m sure. “My predilection as a Conservative generally is to have low and stable and predictable taxes, and that retrospective taxation is to be avoided, but there are Conservative administrations in the past who have felt the need to tax retrospectively and sometimes the circumstances might warrant that.”",News/Business,"Helping cash-strapped Britons won’t add to inflation, says CBI",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/cbi-tony-danker-inflation-help-rising-food-fuel-bills
5/19/2022,"Amazon has invested more than £1bn on TV, movie and live sport content in the UK in recent years and plans to increase spending to make it a must-have streaming service for cash-strapped households. It is the first time that Amazon has revealed the level of investment in Prime Video in the UK, spanning the period since 2018, as competition for viewers intensifies amid a mounting cost of living crisis. While Amazon’s annual UK budget lags that of the $1bn (£810m) spent by Netflix on hits from Bridgerton to Sex Education, it continues to rapidly grow – with big releases in the pipeline such as the Lord of the Rings series – while its rival is in the process of cutting budgets and staff after reporting its first fall in subscribers in a decade. “Our investments are ramping year over year, said Chris Bird, managing director of Prime Video UK, ahead of the unveiling of a major slate of new programming at an event in central London on Thursday. “Over the last five years we have crossed the £1bn mark, that feels like a milestone to recognise our growth here. We are fully committed to our future in the UK, as we are across Europe and the world.” Amazon has doubled down on its commitment to the UK signing a record-breaking long lease deal for its first permanent studio space in the UK at Shepperton Studios, where Netflix also has a deal, and making the surprise decision to move shooting of the mega-budget Lord of the Rings TV series from New Zealand to the UK. New Zealand’s minister for economic development and tourism, Stuart Nash, said that the first series in the saga, called The Rings of Power, which will premiere later this year, cost about NZ$650m (£332m) to make. Bird acknowledged that the streaming market is not immune to the cost of living crisis, but maintained that Prime Video has achieved the status of a “must have” service alongside Netflix. “We are expecting a challenging time [for households] ahead,” he said. “Inflation is rising, the cost of living is soaring and we don’t expect the same level of video engagement from customers as we had seen through the pandemic period. But that is not dampening investment at all. We are not expecting a dramatic slowdown. We are still seeing growth in our business and customers are pleased and excited.” At the end of the first quarter Netflix had 222m global subscribers, Prime Video 152m and Disney+ 138m. In the UK, Netflix remains the market leader with an estimated 14m subscribers, followed by Prime Video on 11.9m and Disney+ at 4.8m, according to Ampere Analysis. “We expect customers will be more savvy in their purchase choices,” he said. “It’s been about multiple subscriptions in the past, but with the challenges of the cost of living perhaps that reduces.” As well as its own subscription video-on-demand service Amazon has an advertising-funded free service called Freevee, which was rebranded from IMDB TV last month, and 100,000 titles to buy or rent as well as offering subscriptions to partner video channels such as reality TV streamer Hayu. Netflix has said that it is to launch an ad-funded subscription tier later this year to attempt to reignite growth. “We are a different service,” said Bird, who worked at British streaming site LoveFilm, which was bought by Amazon in a £200m deal in 2011 to spur its ambitions to take on Netflix in the UK. “Our catalogue, whilst perhaps smaller in volume than other services, is very well crafted and specific in our goal to be seen as high quality.” While US streamers including Amazon, Netflix and Disney continue to inject an increasing amount of money into British-made shows and films, the biggest spenders in the UK remain traditional national broadcasters. The BBC’s total annual content budget across TV, radio and online is about £2.3bn, with spend on TV content about £1.6bn of this. ITV spends about £1.1bn annually on content for its portfolio of channels, while Channel 4’s £700m budget is about the same as Netflix. Last year, a record £5.6bn was spent making blockbusters such as Mission: Impossible 7 and big-budget dramas including Bridgerton in the UK. It was double the level of investment in 2020, when the spread of coronavirus shut down the production industry for months on end, and almost £1.3bn more than the previous record set in pre-pandemic 2019.",News/Media,Amazon’s spend on TV and film in UK passes £1bn as Netflix cuts back,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/19/amazon-prime-video-uk-investment-tv-film
5/19/2022,"The Australian Electoral Commission concedes a large number of Australians – possibly in excess of 100,000 people – who tested positive for Covid early this week and will be isolating on Saturday may not be able to vote in the federal election. Some Covid-positive voters have found themselves caught in a voting eligibility anomaly whereby they missed the deadline to register for postal voting but recorded a positive RAT test too early to access telephone voting. People who tested positive for the virus from Sunday to Tuesday 6pm, but failed to register to postal vote by the Wednesday 6pm deadline, could miss out on casting a ballot. Some voters who tested positive on Tuesday had just 24 hours to register for postal voting while dealing with their diagnosis. The Human Rights Law Centre says the anomaly “risks disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians”. In anticipation of Australia’s first federal election during the pandemic, a special Covid provision was written into the Electoral Act allowing anyone who tested positive after 6pm on Tuesday 17 May to vote via telephone – a method previously only used by voters with vision disabilities. People who did not apply for a postal vote before the Wed 6pm application deadline, haven’t voted yet, tested positive before 6pm Tues, and are in isolation through to after election day, may not be able to vote. That means for people who tested positive from Sunday to Tuesday evening, postal voting was the only option, unless they pre-polled before entering isolation. But applications for postal voting closed at 6pm on Wednesday, so those who did not register before the deadline cannot vote by post. The Guardian has also been contacted by affected voters who claimed they tried to register for postal voting before the deadline but were told their ballot papers would not arrive in time and they should wait until phone voting details became clear on Wednesday – only to ultimately be told they could not vote that way. The exact number of people affected is not clear. The AEC has acknowledged that some in the cohort “may not be able to vote”. A spokesperson said there was no scope to change the voting eligibility rules because they were set out in legislation. “We cannot change this,” they said. Even those who applied for a postal vote before the registration deadline are not guaranteed to receive their ballots before Saturday. The AEC spokesperson said “we will be doing everything we can to ensure people who applied for a postal vote will receive them” on time. On Thursday, the Human Rights Law Centre called on the AEC “to interpret the provisions in a way that upholds the voting rights of all Australians”. The centre’s executive director, Hugh de Kretser, said “the right to vote is the most fundamental part of our democracy” and was “enshrined in the constitution and has been upheld by the high court on many occasions”. “We are alarmed that the AEC is adopting an interpretive approach that seems to be contrary to the intent of the Electoral Act. The AEC’s position risks disenfranchising tens of thousands of Australians unless it is revised. We urge the AEC to clarify its position immediately,” De Kretser said. I’m going to guess that young people, people who speak a different language at home, etc are VERY unlikely to have known about this. Monique Ryan, the teal independent candidate in the Melbourne seat of Kooyong where the contest with Josh Frydenberg is expected to come down to the wire, called on the AEC to provide a way for those affected by the anomaly to vote. She said the issue “is not hard to fix”. “It’s safe to assume that a great many people who were in their sick beds with Covid didn’t know about the postal vote deadline,” Ryan tweeted. “I’m going to guess that young people, people who speak a different language at home etc are VERY unlikely to have known about this.” Kooyong voter Guy Miller tested positive for Covid on Monday and realised on Thursday he had missed the chance to register for a postal vote. When his wife, Carol Miller, called the AEC a representative offered to take Guy off the list so he would avoid a fine for not voting, she said. “I said that’s not the problem, he needs to be able to vote somehow.” Carol Miller claimed the AEC representative then suggested Guy take another RAT test and because it would show positive after the phone voting eligibility came in he would be able to vote by that method. “The AEC is back in the dark ages,” she said. Guy Miller added via telephone: “It’s really slack. This is the first time ever that people have a real chance to make a change. Normally it’s a forgone conclusion in Kooying … I’d hate to be the one vote that could have swayed the election.”",News/Australia news,AEC anomaly means some people isolating with Covid may not be able to vote in Saturday’s election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/aec-anomaly-means-some-people-isolating-with-covid-may-not-be-able-to-vote-in-saturdays-election
