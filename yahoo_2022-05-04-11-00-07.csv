5/4/2022,"A waitress has sparked an animated discussion after airing her biggest on-the-job pet peeves. For almost a year, a 24-year-old TikToker, Lizzy Smith (@c0_0l__) has used the app to chronicle her experiences in the service industry. Her most popular videos give insight into the customer behavior that annoys wait staff the most. What is inflation and what causes it? TikTok is full of content from service industry workers, who often raise issues that others may not be aware of. Starbucks baristas have shared their wildest drink orders, including one that was literally too big for the blender. Restaurant workers have been sharing their daily earnings at places like Waffle House and Hooters. One of Smith’s most popular clips shows the waitress reenacting her biggest pet peeves in real time. Her first issue? When customers cut her off before she can introduce herself. Next, Smith shows what it feels like when she arrives at a table with an order, and no one speaks up to claim it. Both problems resonated deeply with both service workers and customers. The video sparked a major discussion about the responsibilities of the servers — and of the customers. “I’m a food runner and too many ppl just stare at you like you’re crazy when I bring their food,” one user wrote. “When you’re standing there holding two VERY hot plates and there just like staring while you’re asking then who ordered what or like they just ignore,” another agreed. Check out our men's beach and swimwear summer style guide: “Why is it so hard to be a decent person? My friend and I never cut off our server,” another wrote. Some customers, meanwhile, pushed back, wondering why they should be the ones to claim their own food. “Isn’t it literally your responsibility to know who ordered what,” one user commented. “Where I work, I’m taught to get the order in a certain order so I can remember,” another added. Many commenters pushed back against that, wondering why it was an issue to speak up. “Can’t believe y’all are mad about ‘pawning,'” one user argued. “Oh no, your eating experience is ruined because you have to say ‘me’ real quick before you eat.” As is often the case, the debate veered into a discussion of tipping culture in the United States. This has been a hot topic on TikTok lately, thanks to viral videos featuring customers trying to tip with Amazon gift cards and asking for their waitress’s number, after tipping $0.

5/4/2022,"EXCLUSIVE: Republican Sen. Marco Rubio introduced a bill Tuesday that would prohibit employers from receiving tax breaks for expenses related to employees’ ""interstate abortion"" or employees’ children’s ""gender transition procedure"" costs. Rubio, R-Fla., introduced the ""No Tax Breaks for Radical Corporate Activism Act"" on Tuesday, which would ""deny the trade or business expense deduction for the reimbursement of employee costs of child gender transition procedure or travel to obtain an abortion."" BIDEN ‘NOT PREPARED’ TO LEAVE RIGHT TO PRIVACY DETERMINATION TO ‘WHIMS’ OF ‘LOCAL AREAS’ ""Our tax code should be pro-family and promote a culture of life,"" Rubio told Fox News. ""Instead, too often our corporations find loopholes to subsidize the murder of unborn babies or horrific 'medical' treatments on kids."" Rubio added: ""My bill would make sure this does not happen."" ""No deduction shall be allowed under this chapter to an employer for any amount paid or incurred to reimburse an employee for, or to otherwise pay, expenses in connection with— travel for the purpose of obtaining an abortion, or any gender transition procedure for a minor child of the employee,"" the legislation, obtained by Fox News, states. The bill notes several ""exceptions,"" including services ""performed because the individual suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness which would, as certified by a physician, place the individual in imminent danger of death or impairment of major bodily function unless surgery is performed."" The introduction of the bill comes after a number of large corporations, including Amazon, Apple, Citigroup and others, have announced they will cover travel expenses each year for non-life threatening medical treatments, including abortions. Amazon's new benefit, first reported by Reuters on Monday, retroactively applies if an operation is not available within 100 miles of an employee's home and if virtual care is not possible. A Rubio aide also pointed to a reported initiative from Disney that would allow the company's benefit team to help employees and their children in getting ""gender-affirmation procedures."" HARRIS ON ROE V. WADE: 'THIS IS THE TIME TO FIGHT FOR WOMEN AND FOR OUR COUNTRY WITH EVERYTHING WE HAVE' ""Companies across the U.S., including Disney, are proactively helping their employees’ circumvent state laws and harm unborn and young children, and Marco believes they should not receive any tax benefits for these actions,"" Rubio's aide told Fox News. Under current tax law, businesses can deduct all expenses that are ""ordinary and necessary"" for carrying on a trade or business, including employee health care plans, some medical expenses, or other benefits offered as part of an employee compensation package, the aide told Fox News. The aide said that under current law, individual taxpayers can ""deduct abortion and gender transition expenses as medical expenses."" ""This bill would explicitly prohibit employers from deducting — and, as a result, taxpayers from subsidizing — their employee’s interstate abortion or children’s gender transition expenses,"" the aide said. The introduction of Rubio's bill also comes a day after a leaked draft opinion authored by Justice Samuel Alito signaled the Supreme Court's intention to overturn Roe v. Wade. Should Roe v. Wade be overturned, abortions would be left for the states to decide. ""We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,"" Justice Samuel Alito writes in the document, labeled the ""Opinion of the Court"" for the case Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. ""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives."" BIDEN ON SUPREME COURT LEAK: ROE SHOULD NOT BE OVERTURNED, 'A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS FUNDAMENTAL' Alito notes that at the time the Court decided Roe, 30 states had active bans on abortion throughout pregnancy. Alito also wrote in the draft opinion that Americans hold ""sharply conflicting views"" on the subject. ""Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman's right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality. Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be imposed,"" Alito wrote. The Supreme Court on Tuesday in a statement acknowledged that ""a copy of a draft opinion in a pending case"" was published Monday night. ""Justices circulate draft opinions internally as a routine and essential part of the Court’s confidential deliberative work,"" the high court said in a statement. ""Although the document described in yesterday’s reports is authentic, it does not represent a decision by the Court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case."" TRUMP: SUPREME COURT LEAK SETS 'DANGEROUS PRECEDENT,' SAYS ISSUE WON'T HAVE 'TREMENDOUS EFFECT' ON MIDTERMS Chief Justice John Roberts also released a statement Tuesday saying that the court ""will not be affected in any way"" by the leak. ""To the extent this betrayal of the confidences of the Court was intended to undermine the integrity of our operations, it will not succeed,"" Roberts said. ""The work of the Court will not be affected in any way."" ""We at the Court are blessed to have a workforce — permanent employees and law clerks alike — intensely loyal to the institution and dedicated to the rule of law. Court employees have an exemplary and important tradition of respecting the confidentiality of the judicial process and upholding the trust of the Court,"" Roberts said. ""This was a singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here,"" he continued. Roberts said he has ""directed the Marshal of the Court to launch an investigation into the source of the leak.""",U.S./Fox News,Rubio introduces bill prohibiting employers from receiving tax breaks for expenses related to abortions,https://news.yahoo.com/rubio-introduces-bill-prohibiting-employers-224502844.html
5/4/2022,"Someone inside the Supreme Court leaked a draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito that would overturn two landmark abortion rights decisions, Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, to Politico. That much we know. But we don’t know who did it and why they did it. While the main story here is that the Supreme Court now has five votes to overturn women’s reproductive rights, the provenance of the leak still matters. In fact, it very much matters for abortion rights, as it might help the public understand the behind-the-scenes politics within the court that could affect the ultimate outcome of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. There are a very limited number of people who could leak a draft opinion to the press from inside the Supreme Court. There are the nine justices themselves, their law clerks and their support staff. Below are the current theories and why they may or may not affect the outcome here. After Politico published the story on the leaked opinion, the initial speculation online was that this must have been done in anger by a liberal law clerk. This theory, while initially attracting some followers from left-leaning organizations in praise of a “brave clerk,” has come to dominate the right-wing reaction. Republican political consultants and media figures quickly decided that the leaker must be a specific clerk for one of the liberal justices. They went so far as to name this clerk and put a photo of them online. (HuffPost is not naming this person in order to avoid putting a baseless target on them.) There is, however, no evidence that this person was the leaker aside from the fact that they are liberal, opposed the nomination of Justice Brett Kavanaugh as many liberal or left-leaning lawyers were, and at one point spoke to one of the two Politico reporters who broke the leak story. This theory feels plausible. But it doesn’t make much sense. For one, the three-justice liberal bloc on the court lacks real power, and leaking a draft wouldn’t fix that. The liberal justices have to convince two Republicans to come to their side, which is a very high hill to climb on such a high-priority issue for the conservative movement as abortion. And there’s the timing. The leaked draft opinion was written in February. Why wait months to leak it? The liberals, having been in the minority for ages now, still try to influence majority opinions they oppose by making tiny changes around the edges, Yale Law School professor and former Supreme Court clerk Amy Kapczynski tweeted on Tuesday. “Why leak something and undermine that whole strategy?” Kapczynski asked. Protesters took to the steps of the Supreme Court after a leaked opinion showed that five conservatives plan on ending abortion. (Photo: Win McNamee via Getty Images) It’s entirely possible that the leaker is a liberal law clerk acting out of anger or pique or a desire to be anointed as a hero by the Corporate Fake News MSDNC, or whatever. But if the theory is they were trying to change the outcome, it doesn’t make sense. Sure, conservatives will claim that Democrats are now going to do an “insurrection” on the Supreme Court, but you would have to hammer a pylon through your brain to actually believe that. Another theory is that a conservative law clerk leaked the opinion to make sure it is the final opinion. There’s no evidence this theory is correct, either, but it does have one point in its favor: It’s rooted in the history and structure that underlies the internal functioning of the Supreme Court. The internal deliberations of the Supreme Court tend to work like this: A vote is taken on the outcome of a decision and the most senior justice then assigns the opinion to a member of the grouping with a majority of five or more votes. That decision is written and later circulated for edits and for the other justices to write their dissents and concurrences. First concurrences, and then dissents are circulated. Then the majority opinion can be edited for a final draft. “[T]his is about the right timing for concurrences to come out,” Kapczynski tweeted on Tuesday. “I think best bet is that Chief Justice Roberts circulated one recently, adopting a more moderate position.” This is the point at which justices may begin to change their minds about the original opinion they said they supported. So, in theory, Roberts could be trying to peel off members of the original five justices who joined Alito’s majority opinion to secure an opinion that does limit abortion but stops short of overturning Roe and Casey. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the leaked majority opinion overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. (Photo: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) Roberts, while known to oppose abortion, has always kept public opinion about the court’s legitimacy as his paramount concern. For this reason, he has sought to slow-walk the social changes the court’s conservatives are pursuing. Notably, he did not side with the five other conservative justices in allowing Texas’ recent anti-abortion law to go into effect nor did he join Alito’s leaked majority opinion. If a conservative clerk wanted to prevent justices from that original group of five from jumping ship, leaking the draft could be a way to do it. If the court announces an opinion in June and it shows that Brett Kavanaugh or Amy Coney Barrett joined an opinion that doesn’t overturn Roe, they will be assailed as the spawn of David Souter. Signs that conservatives are worried about Roberts’ moderating influence had already emerged in conservative media. A Wall Street Journal editorial warned on April 26 that Roberts “may be trying to turn another Justice now,” just as Roberts himself switched sides in the 2012 case that ended with him writing an opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act. The editorial even contained a “guess” that Alito was the author of the forthcoming majority opinion. “We hope he doesn’t succeed — for the good of the Court and the country,” the editorial stated. This warning shot came within days of when the Politico reporters likely obtained the leaked memo — they were working on the story on May 1, according to The New York Times, four days after The Wall Street Journal editorial. If a conservative clerk wanted to prevent justices from that original group of five from jumping ship, leaking the draft could be a way to do it. This wouldn’t be the first time that conservative media provided an inkling of the internal workings of the court. In May 2012, conservative pundits and media outlets wrote a succession of columns warning that Roberts may have wobbled and decided to side with the liberals in the Affordable Care Act case. The existence of these columns seemed to suggest some kind of leak had come from inside the court that the conservatives had lost Roberts. The National Review ran an editorial on May 24, 2012, calling on Roberts to ignore calls for him to side with liberals and uphold the health care mandate. Then on May 26, 2012, a column by George Will came out with the headline, “Liberals put the squeeze to Justice Roberts.” “Soon after the message trickled from the Court that Roberts’s vote was ‘in flux,’ a right-wing bat signal went out, with a clear message: we need to tell the chief justice to grow a backbone,” Josh Blackman, a conservative lawyer, wrote in his book “Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare.” “George Will and others answered that call. Conservatives, who had been noticeably quiet about the outcome of the case after the conference, suddenly perked up in the home stretch, precisely when the war was being waged within the Court over the final vote.” A similar thing happened in 2019 around the high court’s decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which affirmed that gay and transgender individuals are protected from discrimination by the Civil Rights Act. One month after arguments were heard in the case, National Review and The Wall Street Journal published pieces aimed at steering conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch away from the textualist arguments the liberal Justice Elena Kagan had made. These public calls failed, and Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion based on the original understanding of the text of the Civil Rights Act. Pro-choice demonstrators hold placards in front of the Freedom Tower in Miami on May 3, 2022. (Photo: CHANDAN KHANNA via Getty Images) The theory that a conservative clerk leaked the Dobbs v. Jackson opinion has a logic to it. There’s a purpose, beyond self-aggrandizement or creating a shock: It could be meant to prevent any of the five justices who signed on to Alito’s leaked opinion from going with a softer ruling instead.  And if that’s the reason for the leak, it’s an important statement on the internal struggles of the court, an opaque and unelected institution with incredible power over American lives. Now we are getting into the more outlandish theories, but let’s work this one out anyway. “The story that makes the most sense re the leak is actually Chief Justice Roberts, trying to illustrate to a swing justice what the backlash would be like,” Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at Real Clear Politics, tweeted on Tuesday. “But it is also completely out of character for Roberts; burn the village to save the village isn’t his style.” This has a logic to it, but, as Trende notes, nothing could be more out of character than for Roberts, or one of his clerks, to do this. It goes against everything that he has worked toward as chief justice — although, so does this leaked opinion. Still, it’s hard to imagine that Mr. Court Legitimacy would enable this leak and then issue a press release announcing an investigation into the leak. Could the opinion have been leaked by a support staffer who found a copy accidentally left in a printer? Or could it have come from a computer hack? These theories are highly unlikely. The Politico article contains background information from “[a] person familiar with the court’s deliberations,” that explains “that four of the other Republican-appointed justices — Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett — had voted with Alito in the conference held among the justices after hearing oral arguments in December, and that line-up remains unchanged as of this week.” That information is crucial to the story and is likely information that could only be learned as a justice or law clerk, or from them.

Here Are Four Theories,https://news.yahoo.com/leaked-supreme-court-draft-four-224415722.html
5/4/2022,"As the president weighs broad student loan forgiveness, some Americans expressing frustration over a policy they see as unfair. ""While some may view this debt forgiveness as a slap in the face to people who were responsible and paid off their student loans, this is a bigger slap in the face to those Americans who never went to college,"" Will Bach, a financial advisor based in Ohio, told Yahoo Finance. Research has shown that a college degree generally boosts an individual's earnings over their lifetime. And given that any broad-based forgiveness would cost tens of billions of dollars, all taxpayers — not just by those who have a college degree — would be contributing to the cost of cancellation. ""How can we honestly ask people who did not go to college to subsidize the lives of those who did decide to go to college?"" Bach added. ""To my knowledge, everyone with student loans voluntarily took them. Every instance of a student loan was a voluntary choice that person made."" Some right-leaning academics, including Andrew Gillen of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, argue that there are a variety of problems with cancelling student loan debt. These include the overall cost and the fact that forgiveness does not directly address the core issue of rising college costs. Cancelling $10,000 or $50,000 across the board is ""really badly targeted,"" Gillen said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. ""There there are people who are struggling to repay their debt, and we've got an existing set of solutions — and those solutions aren't working,"" he acknowledged, such as the massive failure of the income-driven repayment system. At the same time, he added, any broad-based forgiveness would be like saying that ""a handful of people that are struggling here, [so] let's get rid of the debt for everybody."" An income cap on who qualified for any loan forgiveness would be a ""no brainer,"" Gillen added, because it would help target the relief towards lower-income struggling debtors. Biden is reportedly considering capping forgiveness to those who earned less than $125,000 or $150,000 as individual filers the previous year, The Washington Post reported recently. For couples filing jointly, the cap would be around $250,000 or $300,000. ""The other thing that would also be a no-brainer is having different criteria for graduate loans than you do for undergraduate loans,"" Gillen said, ""because we really do restrict how much you can borrow at the undergraduate level ... whereas at graduate level, because those students can borrow virtually without limit."" The proposal ""is nothing more than a welfare program for the upper class,"" Bach said. ""The people who have responsibly saved and paid for college will not benefit from this at all."" Bach, who worked as a police officer for five years after college, added that he took on student loans to pay for his MBA in finance and paid it off within a few years of graduating. He currently is a certified financial planner and financial adviser. Advocates pushed back against critics of Biden's plans to cancel debt. “I'm sorry we weren’t able to win cancel student debt sooner,"" Melissa Byrne, a political organizer and an activist pushing for student debt cancellation, told Yahoo Finance. ""I'm sorry that political operatives in the '70s and the '80s caved to Ronald Reagan and let folks defund higher education. ... But I'm not sorry we’re about to hopefully get a win now."" Louise Seamster, a sociologist at the University of Iowa, told Yahoo Finance that the group pushing back against cancellation is not a large one and asked them to put themselves in student debtors' shoes. ""As a sociologist, my work involves teaching students to consider how their own experiences are shaped by larger forces,"" Seamster said in an email to Yahoo Finance. ""As such, I would encourage people who have been lucky enough to pay down their debt to reflect on what factors allowed them to pay down their debt: maybe attending school when public education was actually affordable; the support of a partner or family; or graduating into a favorable economy."" She added that critics ""might have made career choices that prioritized income, but I hope they think what our society would look like if everyone had made those same choices and who would be educating their children or providing them medical care."" Some studies have shown that women and people of color take on more debt to go to college compared to their white male peers. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) has repeatedly argued that student loan forgiveness is ""a matter of racial and economic justice"" given the disproportionate burden on borrowers of color. ""Canceling student debt is one of the most powerful ways to address racial and economic equity issues,"" a recent letter from prominent Democrats, including Pressley, asserted to the president. ""The student loan system mirrors many of the inequalities that plague American society and widens the racial wealth gap. Black students in particular borrow more to attend college, borrow more often while they are in school, and have a harder time paying their debt off than their white peers."" Seamster added that if Americans still feel like cancellation of debt is unfair, ""I invite them to join the movement for free college to make the same public higher education benefits available to all and make student debt itself unnecessary."" Bach said he doubted that forgiving debt would help the economy, and that it was an opportunity for Democrats to gain clout with voters. ""I don't think there is any evidence that this is going to help with the U.S. economy or student debt holders,"" he said. ""This is simply a Hail Mary for President Biden who has just hit a 40% approval rating with the younger population."" The political benefit seems to be one thing both sides agree on: In a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, Pressley stated that ""Democrats win when we deliver, and we have to deliver in ways that are impactful, tangible and transformative, like canceling student debt. This is good policy. And it is also good politics."" Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com. Follow her on Twitter @aarthiswami.

5/4/2022,"The Ukrainian military said on May 2 that it used a Bayraktar combat drone to destroy two Russian military patrol boats near Snake Island, off the southeast coast of Odesa Oblast. Video published by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi, shows a drone software interface with coordinates that correspond to a location south of Zmiinyi Island, known internationally as Snake Island, in the Black Sea. The drone is seen hovering over and striking two boats, which the Ukrainian defense forces said were Russian Raptor-class patrol boats. The Bayraktar drone is seen in a clip cut between the two strikes. The Russian Navy did not immediately confirm the report that two of its ships were hit. The condition of the crew and the boats was unknown. Snake Island is where Ukrainian soldiers reportedly told a Russian warship crew to go “f***” themselves early in the war, a story that was commemorated by a postage stamp released in April. The Ukrainian Postal Service said on April 18 that of the one million copies of the Snake Island stamp issued, half a million had been sold after only five days, with an envelope with the stamp selling for $1,000 on Ebay. The Turkish Bayraktar drone has been highly effective for Ukraine against Russian armored vehicles and military hardware, even inspiring a viral folk song.

5/4/2022,"ROME—Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Pope Francis has floated the idea that he wants to take a trip to Kyiv to try to broker a ceasefire. But now he says he would prefer to go to Moscow to try to talk some sense into Vladimir Putin, who he has not outwardly condemned in the now nearly three-month-old war and only did so lightly in a lengthy interview with an Italian newspaper. “I feel that before going to Kyiv, I must go to Moscow,” he told Corriere Della Sera in an interview that ran Tuesday. But the meeting would not exactly be to condemn Putin, based on what he told the paper. He said that the real “scandal” of Putin’s war is “NATO barking at Russia’s door,” which he said caused the Kremlin to “react badly and unleash the conflict.” Never mind that the 85-year-old pontiff is unable to walk after tearing a ligament in his knee (for which he says he will soon have surgery), or that Putin won’t even answer his calls. Francis repeated comments he has made in general audiences and in other interviews that the war is nothing more than a giant opportunity for a “trade in arms” and that it is still ongoing because of the constant shuttling of weapons to Ukraine. He has spoken twice by phone to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but mostly to urge him not to fight back. He also went to the Russian embassy to the Holy See days after the invasion began to “register his concerns” about what was happening. “I don’t know how to answer—I’m too far away—the question of whether it is right to supply the Ukrainians,” he told the paper. “The clear thing is that weapons are being tested there. The Russians now know that tanks are of little use and are thinking of other things. This is why wars are waged: to test the weapons we have produced. Few people are fighting this trade, but more should be done.” Whether the Italian journalists didn’t ask—or whether he didn’t answer— there was no mention about what would happen if Ukrainians were not fiercely fighting back, whether it would mean a full annexation of the entire country, millions of deaths, or empowering an already insatiably power-hungry Putin. Francis veered toward conspiracy theory as he blamed the international community for instigating the war. “You cannot think that a free state can make war on another free state,” he said. “In Ukraine, it seems that it was others who created the conflict. I am pessimistic but we must do everything possible to stop the war.” The pope then said that in a state visit to Rome by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, he was told “the Russians have a plan, that everything will end on May 9” without giving any further explanation. May 9 is the day Russia celebrates its liberation and the end of World War II. The one person Francis will not meet is Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, who the pope fears is becoming “Putin’s altar boy.” Francis said he spoke with him on the phone for 40 minutes on March 15. “And I told him: I completely fail to understand this,” he said. “Brother, we are not state clerics; we cannot use the language of politics, but that of Jesus. We are pastors of the same holy people of God.” He said that 40 days ago he asked his secretary of state to start the process of organizing a visit to Moscow instead of Ukraine, but that Putin had not responded. “I am not going to Kyiv for now,” he said. “I feel that I must not go. First I must go to Moscow. First I must meet Putin. But I am also a priest, what can I do? I do what I can. If Putin would only open the door.” News of the potential trip to Moscow put the Vatican press corps who travel with the pontiff on high alert, with many wondering if they would be arrested if they reported on discussions of the war if they were in Russia. But even the pontiff concedes that a meeting in Moscow is a long shot. “I fear that Putin cannot, and does not, want to have this meeting at this time,” he said. “But how can you not stop so much brutality?” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/4/2022,"Japan is covered in colorful carp kites this week. Here’s what you need to know about koinobori, a Japanese tradition that’s centuries old. Buy, sell or hold? How to decide what to do with a plummeting stock A koinobori is a large funnel kite or wind sock shaped like a carp fish. Celebrations using koinobori in Japan date back to as early as the 1600s, during the mid-Edo era. The vibrant kites appear in late April and early May, centering around May 5th, Children’s Day in Japan. Watch this Brooklyn bedroom go from drab to fabulous in one day: A brief history of koinobori Koinobori translates roughly to “carp streamer,” with “koi” meaning carp and “nobori” meaning flag. According to Sugoii-Japan, the koinobori came about between 1603 and 1868. The Shogun, a group of elite military leaders, wanted to celebrate their male heirs by raising the koi flags. The koi is pretty symbolic in Japanese culture. An old myth prevails that when the fish tried to swim upstream in the Koga River, it completed the impossible task and became a magical dragon. Thus, the fish represents courage and determination. When locals caught wind of the Shogun’s practice, they began imitating the celebration. Modern koinobori in Japan today Since 1948, Japanese families have been flying koinobori on Children’s Day for all kids, not just boys. Nestled in Japan’s official Golden Week, Children’s Day is a national holiday to celebrate the health and growth of young people. A koinobori set is traditionally displayed vertically on a flag pole by a family. The flags have evolved into personal expressions of art with unique details, but each koinobori’s color does have a special meaning. According to Koinobori-Japan, the first flag is usually a colorful streamer with the family’s crest. The next and largest flag is black and represents the father, the second-largest is red and represents the mother, and the following flags represent the children, from eldest to youngest. But these days, most families, especially in urban areas, don’t have enough space to hang their flags vertically. You can expect to see koinobori hanging horizontally nowadays, dangling on strings above buildings, rivers and valleys. Regardless of how they hang, these beautiful cultural motifs reflect Japan’s past, present and future by unifying people all over the country.

5/4/2022,"A released investigation report has shed more light on a 2020 incident that saw a two-star Marine Corps general relieved of his command overseeing Marine forces in Europe and Africa. Maj. Gen. Stephen M. Neary was relieved in October 2020 after Marines alleged he used what a report from investigators would categorize as the ""full N-word"" after overhearing some service members listening to rap music in his headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. Stars and Stripes was the first outlet to report the allegations. Now, the report from the Inspector General of the Marine Corps, released to Military.com after a Freedom of Information request, reveals exactly what the Marines alleged Neary told them. Read Next: How Well Do the Army's New Guns Perform? That's Classified, But Soldiers Will Carry More Weight, Less Ammo According to investigators, on the morning of July 22, 2020, Neary was on Devil Dog Field across from the Marine headquarters building when he heard eight Marines listening to the song ""Put It On"" by the artist ""Big L."" Neary told the Marine nearest him to change the song. After the group finished their workout, Neary walked over to the Marines for a more detailed talk. What was said during this more detailed talk is the subject of disagreement between the Marines and Neary, but it's this conversation that would lead to his ouster. According to one Marine, who later filed a complaint with the inspector general, Neary told the group that ""[full n-word] should never be used and it is a word of hate"" before adding that ""[full n-word] is the reason 'you people' are doing riots in the U.S. 'you people' are the reason why the country is the way it is."" According to that Marine, Neary went on to tell the group that ""it's your generation that's burning buildings down and starting these protests"" -- just months after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. ""He also said, 'go ahead and call HR, I am the head of HR,'"" the Marine's account alleged. These allegations were backed up by four other Marines interviewed by investigators. The report notes that each Marine's account of the general's comments included the allegation that ""Neary used a racial slur two times, used the phrase 'you people' in a manner that offended them, and made reference to being the head of 'HR.'"" Neary's main argument was that ""although he did utter a racial slur when speaking to subordinates, he did so for clarity and to denounce its use."" He also ""admitted saying the racial slur one time but denied repeating it more than once,"" the report said. ""Neary also denied using the phrase 'you people'"" or ""saying anything to the Marines about 'HR' or being the head of 'HR'"" to investigators, the report added. However, in the days after the incident, the report notes Neary told an official whose name is redacted in the released document that ""he probably said something like that"" when asked about the ""you people"" remark but noted that ""he was referring to the youth or the young people out in the streets rioting."" Investigators said all five Marines who were there for the talk and provided testimony ""expressed disbelief"" that Neary chose to utter the full word instead of saying the phrase ""n-word."" Two said they tuned out the general after he said it, and several Marines said they lost respect for him after the incident. In the days after the exchange, Neary held a meeting with his noncommissioned officers in which he read a prepared statement and tried to answer questions. Investigators found that, while Neary apologized, ""he did not admit that his use of a racial slur was wrong but, rather, defended his use by saying it was acceptable as a 'teaching moment.'"" The report notes that several Marines who went to this meeting said they believed Neary's apology ""was not sincere and they saw it as more of a 'cover your butt' action."" The inspector general ultimately found that Neary violated the ""requirement of exemplary conduct"" that was expected of him -- though the report notes the general himself disagreed. Neary ""criticized the quality of the investigation and the report;"" ""highlighted what he described as 'factual inaccuracies' in the report,"" and alleged conflicts of interest from officials and investigators. Military.com asked the Marine Corps about Neary's current status and assignment but did not immediately receive a reply. On Nov. 3, 2020, Maj. Gen. Michael Langley took over as commander of Marine Forces Europe and Africa, the post held by Neary until weeks prior. On May 6, 2021, Maj. Gen. Tracy King took over the position in a change of command ceremony. -- Konstantin Toropin can be reached at konstantin.toropin@military.com. Follow him on Twitter @ktoropin.

5/4/2022,"The image of being the world’s “second strongest army” that the Russian army used to cultivate has been shown to be a complete sham. Russia’s military is not as scary as it thought it was. Quite the opposite: it looks more like an army of looters that is, in its nature, a crowd of randomly conscripted individuals who dream about escaping the war. The best evidence for this is provided by the Russian soldiers’ own phone conversations with their relatives. Those conversations tell an interesting story about moral degradation within the Russian armed forces. The phone recordings are provided by Ukraine’s security services, which intercept them with the latest telecommunication technology. Read also: Five faces of Russian killers involved in the murder and rape of Ukraine’s Bucha Combatants from “Putin's victorious armada” are not talking about patriotism anymore.

NV collected the most shocking confessions of the Russian invaders that were intercepted recently. 
*** - I don’t know whether I’ll be able to take everything with me, I’ll need to get over the border. And I have lots of stuff. As soon as we invade the city – any house is yours, just come in. I’ve collected some dollar cash this way. Will be back, will go to currency exchange. By the way, is gold getting more expensive? - At the beginning of the war it was growing in price. Now back to where it was. Bud don’t worry: gold is always in demand. Not like the Russian ruble.

So much f****ng sh*t with looting. *** — In the morning we did our offensive operation. We had intelligence report – no Ukrainian soldiers there, no mines, nothing. So we moved forward. Our tank was going in front of us. And the tank was shelled immediately. It moved to the left and hit a mine. Tank personnel got out – and were hit by shelling. Next two tanks joined the mess. Out battalion commander was wounded, we had to evacuate him. Five people from infantry stayed with us. Others refused to do anything… It’s like hell here. Our generals just want us to move forward, to keep moving.

The general died in the hospital later. *** — The Russian Guard from Moscow Oblast and tank servicemen from Boguchar (in Voronezh oblast) were shooting at each other, killing each other right there, on the field. All were killed, that’s it. - I heard about it. - During the first month of the war we were completely shocked. We move on and then just start shooting each other, then if we’re successful – we have a chance to get away. Our rangers didn’t even come to Izyum (in Kharkiv oblast). They’re lost somewhere, though supposed to be our elite forces. They’re probably defending some bushes somewhere.  *** — So, just looting the locals.

5/4/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin put the West on notice on Tuesday that he could terminate exports and deals, the Kremlin's toughest response yet to the sanctions burden imposed by the United States and allies over the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Putin, Russia's paramount leader since 1999, signed a broad decree on Tuesday which forbade the export of products and raw materials to people and entities on a sanctions list that he instructed the government to draw up within 10 days. The decree, which came into force with its publication, gives Moscow the power to sow chaos across markets as it could at any moment halt exports or tear up contracts with an entity or individual it has sanctioned. The Russian government has 10 days to draw up lists of those it will sanction beyond the Western politicians it has already. Putin explicitly framed the decree as a response to what he cast as the illegal actions of the United States and its allies meant to deprive ""the Russian Federation, citizens of the Russian Federation and Russian legal entities of property rights or the restricting their property rights"". The decree sets out ""retaliatory special economic measures in connection with the unfriendly actions of some foreign states and international organizations"". Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine prompted the United States and its allies to impose the most severe sanctions in modern history on Russia and Moscow's business elite, steps Putin casts as a declaration of economic war. The West's attempt to economically isolate Russia - one of the world's biggest producers of natural resources - has propelled the global economy into uncharted waters with soaring prices and warnings of food shortages. 'ECONOMIC WAR' Putin, 69, has repeatedly warned that Moscow will respond in kind, though until Tuesday the Kremlin's toughest economic response had been to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria and demand a new payment scheme for European buyers of gas. Tuesday's decree forbids the export of products and raw materials to people and entities that the Kremlin has sanctioned. It forbids any transactions with such people or entities - even under current contracts. Putin tasked the government with drawing up the list of foreign individuals and companies to be sanctioned, as well as defining ""additional criteria"" for a number of transactions that could be subject to restrictions. ""This is a framework decree,"" said Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at Carnegie Moscow Center and founder of the R.Politik political analysis firm. ""Now all the specific lists should be developed by the government. That's the main thing and we need to wait for."" Since the West imposed sanctions on Russia, the $1.8 trillion economy has been heading for its biggest contraction since the years following the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union, amid soaring inflation. A significant transfer of Russian assets has begun as the Russian state gains even more influence over the economy, many major Western investors - such as energy giants BP and Shell - exit, and oligarchs try to restructure their business empires.

5/4/2022,"After the death of Marine Corps Capt. Ross Reynolds during a training exercise in Norway on March 18, widow Lana Reynolds found herself not only grappling with the devastation of loss but also with financial burdens, according to her father, Tom Wando. The couple were married on Feb. 9, four days before the 27-year-old Marine's deployment to Norway. Wando set up a GoFundMe page April 25 to raise funds for the home mortgage, a school loan and a car loan. Wando said he set the fundraiser’s goal at $400,000 to match what his daughter would’ve received if she were the designated beneficiary of his policy with Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, which provides life insurance for active-duty service members. Wando said that in January, when Reynolds, of Leominster, was made aware of his deployment to Norway, he had designated someone other than his then-girlfriend Lana to receive the funds in case of his death. Reynolds had done the same for the death gratuity of $100,000, which is given to a designated surviving person in the case of a military member's death, according to Wando. “My intention is not to put pressure on the other person,” said Wando. “My intention is to have the will of (Reynolds) be done.” Another GoFundMe page is also raising money for Lana Reynolds. The page was set up by a family friend and had raised over $12,000 as of April 29. As of April 29, the GoFundMe page set up by Wando had collected $8,000. “I don’t think that it will even reach the threshold, but at least I will be making a contribution as her father,” said Wando.

5/4/2022,"There is enough evidence to support Johnny Depp's $50 million claim of defamation. On Tuesday, the actor's legal team rested their case after 13 days of testimony as Depp says Amber Heard ruined his career by presenting herself as a victim of abuse. After hearing oral arguments by both sides, the judge denied a motion from Heard's legal team to dismiss the lawsuit. Depp is suing Heard over a Dec. 2018 op-ed she wrote that was published in The Washington Post. There are three parts of the article that Depp is suing over specifically. One is the title of the online op-ed: ""I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture's wrath. That has to change."" The second is how Heard described herself as ""A public figure representing domestic abuse."" The third is when she wrote, ""I had the rare vantage point of seeing, in real-time, how institutions protect men accused of abuse."" Judge Penney Azcarate denied the defense's motion to strike for statements two and three. She's taking the first under advisement. ""Last night, I reviewed all the evidence submitted in this matter,"" Judge Azcarate said. ""As to the second and third alleged defamatory statements... I view the evidence in light most favorable to the plaintiff."" Although Heard didn't name Depp in the article, it's ""reasonably inferred"" she's talking about Depp. ""There is evidence in the case that a jury could weigh that the statements were made by the defendant, that the statements were about the plaintiff, that the statement was published, that the statement is false and the defendant made the statement knowing it to be false or the defendant made it so recklessly as to amount to a willful disregard of the truth,"" the judge continued. As for the headline, Judge Azcarate said she can't rule on that yet as there is apparently outstanding evidence that is not yet submitted. Depp looked elated after the ruling, giving his attorney Benjamin Chew a big hug. ""Over the last 3.5 weeks, we've seen and heard from nearly 30 witnesses who have attested to and supported Mr. Depp's claims that Ms. Heard defamed him in her 2018 op-ed,"" a spokesperson for Depp tells Yahoo Entertainment. ""Ms. Heard's reckless op-ed, in turn, caused him to lose a $22.5 million deal with Disney for Pirates of the Caribbean 6, resulting in an overall loss of earnings of over $40 million since December 18, 2018."" Earlier on Tuesday, Depp's final witness testified to the actor's loss of earnings after the op-ed. Forensic accountant Mike Spindler told the court: ""I concluded that Mr. Depp suffered lost earnings of approximately $40 million."" ""Numerous witnesses have testified that Ms. Heard engaged in psychological, verbal and physical abuse towards Mr. Depp and we are pleased at Chief Judge Azcarate's ruling to continue with the trial after Mr. Rottenborn failed to convince the court that there was reason to dismiss the case,"" Depp's spokesperson continues. ""We stand confident in the future of the case and for the truth to be continued to be shared."" It was expected that Heard's lawyers would try and dismiss the lawsuit and also expected that the judge would deny the motion. Court resumed after lunch with Heard's team calling their first witness: Dawn M. Hughes, a clinical and forensic psychologist. It's expected that Heard will testify later this week.

5/4/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. has learned a great deal about Russian military shortfalls and capabilities in the first two months of the war in Ukraine, top Pentagon leaders told Congress Tuesday. But they warned that Moscow is learning from its mistakes as the war shifts to a new phase, and that will shape the artillery and other weapons systems the U.S. will provide. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that if Congress approves funding, the most critical things that Ukraine needs are anti-tank, anti-aircraft and shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. Milley added that with the fighting now concentrated in the eastern Donbas region, Ukrainian forces also need more tanks and other mechanized vehicles, which the U.S. and other nations are providing. The coming weeks, they said, will be crucial. Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February, the U.S. had provided about $1 billion in weapons and gear to the Ukrainian military, and had been training troops for years. Since the invasion, the U.S. has committed another $3.7 billion in weapons and other aid, and is seeking a $33 billion supplemental appropriation from Congress that includes a wide range of military and other support. Senators, including Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., pressed Austin and Milley on whether weapons are actually getting out to the troops on the front lines, or if they are being diverted or hoarded. Austin said it's difficult to know since there are no U.S. personnel on the ground in Ukraine to monitor the weapons flow. But he said they talk to their counterparts in Ukraine regularly, and stress the need for accountability in weapons distribution. Austin pointed to early failures by Russia, including almost immediate struggles with logistics, and difficulties getting food, water and supplies to troops. “As we saw things unfold on the ground, we saw them not able to support themselves logistically, we saw them make some bad assumptions at the beginning of this, we saw them fail to integrate aerial fires with their ground maneuver, and just a number of missteps,” Austin said. “ I attribute a lot of that to lack of leadership at the lower level.” The leadership problems, he said, forced Russia to send higher ranking generals to the battlefront, where “many” have been killed. Austin said the U.S. expects to see some of the same mistakes as the fighting in the Donbas and across southern Ukraine escalates, as Russia tries to wrest control of a solid stretch of land from the east, through Mariupol, along the Sea of Azov to Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula seized by Russian and annexed in March 2014. But, he said, “they will learn from what they did in the early stages of this fight. And we’ll see them improve their logistical efforts. And we’ll see them improve their massing of fires and that sort of business. But some things they won’t be able to correct.” Austin and Milley said that Russia's failure to train young commanders to make decisions, has led to a very top-heavy organization that hasn't been as nimble and effective as the Ukrainian forces. Milley said the U.S. and other Western nations taught Ukrainian forces about mission command and decentralized control and tactics, which are more successful on a dynamic battlefield. He also said the U.S. “opened up the pipes"" and sent a ""significant amount of intelligence” to Ukraine both before the invasion, and as the fight has gone on. In a related matter, President Joe Biden has nominated Army Gen. Christopher G. Cavoli to be the next top general for Europe, and to serve as the Supreme Allied Commander for NATO. Cavoli is currently serving as commander of U.S. Army Europe-Africa. His nomination now goes to the U.S. Senate for confirmation. He would replace Air Force Gen. Tod D.

5/4/2022,"The only way Russia’s war in Ukraine ends is with Russian President Vladimir Putin dead, Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s top military spy, said Monday. “Leaving him a way to retreat is one of the strategies, but it is almost unrealistic,” Budanov said when asked if Putin could end this war alive. “He is a war criminal for the whole world. This is his end, he drove himself into a dead end.” “Don't worry, Ukraine will win,” Budanov said, speaking during an interview The New Voice of Ukraine released Monday. Once Putin is somehow offed—and Budanov does not offer up any potential details of how an ouster or assassination may happen—the future of Russia could go one of two paths. First, Russia could be divided into multiple parts, Budanov opined. The other option, however, could lead to the “relative preservation of the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation when changing the country's leadership,” he said. President Joe Biden, too, has suggested that Putin should not remain in power. Tapped Calls Expose Russia’s Heinous Treatment of Own Dead Troops “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said in remarks delivered in Warsaw, Poland, during a visit in March. The White House sought to walk back the remarks to some extent, urging caution at assuming Biden meant Putin should be assassinated or assuming that the Biden Administration is now seeking regime change in Russia. Watch: Could Russia’s Victory Day be a milestone for the war in Ukraine? U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken has also suggested that it would be up to the Russian people to determine whether Putin would remain in power. The comments from Ukraine’s military intelligence chief, though, come days in advance of May 9, or Victory Day, the day Russia celebrates the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany—a date which many military analysts have warned could be a key date for escalation in Russia’s war in Ukraine. Putin has harped repeatedly on his false claim that he wants to “de-nazify” Ukraine, and Victory Day could be a pivotal and symbolic moment for Putin, whose forces have been blundering their way through the war, to try to declare victory, analysts warn. Russian forces have not been securing as many wins or moving as quickly as Putin would have liked, U.S. defense officials have said. They’ve been abandoning equipment, quitting on the spot, and stalling on roads after failing to secure the appropriate supplies to refuel. And after failing to take Kyiv, the capital, Russian forces have been retreating and regrouping to launch attacks anew in eastern portions of Ukraine in the Donbas. And after failing to reach multiple deadlines in the war, Putin is likely scrambling for some kind of victory to bring home and tout to his country, Budanov said, adding that he is convinced Putin, for now, is planning to try to mobilize for Victory Day. “They had the main deadline—to have time to finish by April 24… they completely failed him. The second date is to complete the operation at least in Donbas by May 9,” Budanov said. “Putin cannot admit that he is losing to Ukraine,” Budanov warned. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/4/2022,"It’s time to talk about what some folks would rather forget. The sign’s language was blunt. There was never any question about its message, or its target. The first word was a racist slur. Then: “Don’t Let the Sun Set on Your Head in This Town.” Originally, the “sundown sign” went up at the train station. Then, it was moved to the middle of the main street. It happened more than a century ago. In Texas. De Leon, Texas. It wasn’t the only sign like that in Texas. I’ve met people who claimed they personally saw signs in Bowie, Glen Rose and Grand Saline. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not picking on Texas or even the South. In a Web search, I found similar racist signs mentioned in towns in California, Washington, Nebraska and Indiana. One town in British Columbia even had a sign warning Chinese to stay out. But we know for sure that De Leon, 95 miles southwest of Fort Worth, had one of those signs for years. It went up more than a century ago, in 1886, in the bitter decade after Reconstruction. That was so long ago that the nice folks in that quiet peanut farming town might rather forget it. I happened to find it because two historians have written about it. The De Leon sign is actually part of a more shameful story in 19th-century Texas. White vigilantes threatened the Black residents of Comanche County and forced them to move out. In the 1880s, Comanche County was a growing cattle and cotton market. The towns of Comanche, De Leon and Gustine and the surrounding county were home to 8,608 people, including 79 Black residents. Those were troubled times in Texas, both for race relations and the justice system. According to The New Handbook of Texas, white lynch mobs had begun to undermine the entire justice system in 1885, abducting and killing 23 white men, 19 Black men and one white woman. The next year, what became known as “the Comanche County exodus” began with the killing of a white woman, Sallie Stephens. According to historian B.B. Lightfoot’s 1953 account in Southwestern Historical Quarterly, a Black suspect named Tom McNeal was lynched. After the sign went up at the De Leon train station, armed white vigilantes went door-to-door and told every Black resident to pack up and get out of Comanche County. One by one, every Black family moved away, mostly to Waco or Dallas. They abandoned family homes, churches, farms and the land of lifelong memories. By the 1890 census, the only Black residents were two orphaned children who lived with white families. Later, the Texas Central Railroad asked to move the De Leon sign. The train porters were being threatened. So it was moved to the town well in the middle of Texas Avenue between the peanut mill and a tractor dealer, according to an updated 1996 report in a local magazine, the Messenger. The earlier account deadpanned: “Because it has no Negro population, Comanche County is one of the few places in the South that has no apparent race problem.” Comanche County did not have one Black resident in 1940, according to the New Handbook. By 1970, the census counted two. The 2000 census found 62 Black residents in Comanche County, still fewer than in 1880. Neither report says when the De Leon sign was taken down.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"In a ‘sundown town’ in Texas, white vigilantes forced Black residents to leave home",https://news.yahoo.com/sundown-town-texas-white-vigilantes-214539094.html
5/4/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine has formally closed its four Black and Azov sea ports, which Russian forces have captured, the Ukrainian agriculture ministry said on Monday. The Azov Sea ports of Mariupol, Berdiansk and Skadovsk and the Black Sea port of Kherson were closed ""until the restoration of control"", the ministry said in a statement. ""The adoption of this measure is caused by the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, carrying out cargo, transport and other related economic activities, ensuring the appropriate level of safety of navigation,"" it said. All Ukrainian seaports have suspended their activity as a result of the Russian invasion in late February. Russian forces captured some ports and blockaded others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday Ukraine could lose tens of millions of tonnes of grain due to Russia's control of Black Sea shipping, triggering a food crisis that will affect Europe, Asia and Africa. ""Russia does not let ships come in or go out, it is controlling the Black Sea,"" Zelenskiy told the Australian news programme 60 Minutes. ""Russia wants to completely block our country's economy."" Russia calls its intervention in Ukraine a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and that the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. Ukraine, a major agricultural producer, used to export most of its goods by sea but has been forced to switch to export by train via its western border or via its small Danube river ports. The ministry said last week Ukraine's grain exports had reached 45.709 million tonnes in the 2021/22, July-June season. It said the volume included 763,000 tonnes exported in April but gave no comparative figures. Senior agriculture officials said this month that Ukraine exported up 300,000 tonnes of grain in March.

5/4/2022,"EXCLUSIVE: Attorneys for Amber Heard are planning to ask a Virginia judge on Tuesday to dismiss Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation case against their client. However, the defense team is almost certain to come up short, and they know it. How To Watch The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial More from Deadline Amber Heard Legal Team Shifts Tactics As Actress Prepares To Testify; Johnny Depp Had $22.5M 'Pirates 6' Deal, Manager Claims How To Watch The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial; Case Resumes Tuesday Tesla Shares Move Higher After CEO Elon Musk Says He Has Wrapped $8.5B In Stock Sales To Fund Twitter Acquisition Under the statutes of the Old Dominion, lawyers for the defense in civil cases essentially are “required,” as one legal source told us, to enter a motion to strike once the plaintiff has wrapped up their case and witnesses. Zeroing in on the specific claims of plaintiff Depp and evidence presented to support said claims, Heard’s legal team led by Elaine Bredehoft and Ben Rottenborn likely will make the motion Tuesday before Judge Penny Azcarate to agree with, reject or take under advisement, we hear. A member of Johnny Depp's security team claims he witnessed Amber Heard physically assault the actor. Travis McGivern, who has been Depp's bodyguard for almost a decade, testified on Monday that Heard threw a Red Bull can at Depp, spit on him and punched the Pirates of the Caribbean star in the face. With the jury taken out of the courtroom, lawyers for both sides will have an allotted short(ish) time to make their points to Azcarte. After that, unless she makes the unlikely decision to ax the case, the judge will tell the attorneys she’s either immediately refusing the motion to strike or taking some time to think about it. She then will call the jury back in for the defense to commence its case. Pretty much assured to be unsuccessful in this high-profile matter, the motion’s primary point is to assure certain appeal rights to the defense if necessary. Reps for Heard and her lawyers had no comment on the probable move when contacted by Deadline today. Depp sued his ex-wife and Rum Diary co-star for big bucks in March 2019 after Heard penned a Washington Post op-ed about be a survivor of domestic abuse. As all sides have stated and anyone who can read can see, the 2018 piece in the Jeff Bezos-owned paper never mentioned Depp by name. Delayed by the pandemic and other issues, the case was challenged several times by Heard to little avail before the five-week trial kicked off on April 11 in the Fairfax County Courthouse. In summer 2020, the Aquaman star countersued Depp for $100 million. Later that same year, in another wrinkle in the legal fabric, Depp failed in his UK libel suit against The Sun tabloid for calling him a “wife-beater” in print. Perpetually at the periphery of the Virginia trial, that British case was in many ways a trial run – no pun totally intended – to the current American case. While the burden of proof is much higher in the US for the litigious Depp than the UK for a libel or defamation claim, the British case mainly differs from the current one in so far as Heard was not a party in the case overseas – though she did testify. “This is the same evidence given in the UK case which he resoundingly lost,” a source close to the Heard camp told Deadline of their POV on the way the Ben Chew and Camille Vasquez-led US case has played out so far. “So I supposed it’s now just a variation on that old saying ‘If at first, you don’t succeed, lie lie again,'” the source added. Despite all the explicit revelations that have come out from the end of the couple’s marriage, the 2019 lawsuit and this trial so far, this case is legally entirely about what was said in that WaPo op-ed, and what the fallout was – which in no small degree centers on the First Amendment. In Virginia, Heard is set right now to be the second witness for the defense after clinical and forensic psychologist Dr. Dawn Hughes takes the stand. Often wearing sunglasses, Depp took the stand on his own behalf for part of the second and third week of the trial. Big names like Avengers alum Paul Bettany, James Franco and would-be Twitter owner Elon Musk were on pre-trial witness lists for the respective parties. Last week it became clear Bettany would not be called, despite a toxic mouthful of 2013 texts between the WandaVision actor and Depp attacking Heard were read out in court here, as they were in the UK action. Franco and Musk are not expected to take the stand in person or virtually either now. What will undoubtedly come up again is Depp’s insistence that Heard’s WaPo op-ed “destroyed” his career and cost him lucrative roles in top tier movies such as a still yet-unmade sixth Pirates of the Caribbean flick — even though it seems he was never officially asked to return to the Disney distributed franchise. As his lawyers have pressed in the five-week trial that started on April 11, Depp has said over and over since mid-2019 that in fact he was the victim of domestic abuse in the relationship, not Heard. Of note, Depp and Heard’s 2016 divorce was characterized by such allegations on her part and a restraining order against the past Oscar nominee. Yet, even after releasing a joint statement on the end of the relationship, Depp never brought up such topics publicly until after the op-ed was published. With testimony via video link and live in the courtroom, including a security guard who said he saw Heard punch Depp in 2015, the plaintiff’s side inched towards the end of its case on Monday. The day’s session ended with a February 4 2022 video deposition from Erin Falati, also known under her maiden name Erin Boerum, who was a former nurse to the couple. Apparently, the last witness for the plaintiff, the deposition of Heard’s former personal nurse will pick up on Tuesday morning.

5/4/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s businesses and inaugural committee have reached a deal to pay Washington, D.C., $750,000 to resolve a lawsuit that alleged the committee overpaid for events at his hotel and enriched the former president’s family in the process, according to the District of Columbia’s attorney general. Attorney General Karl Racine announced the settlement agreement in the case against the Presidential Inaugural Committee, the Trump Organization and the Trump International Hotel in Washington in a tweet on Tuesday. The document had not yet been signed by a judge. The agreement says the case is being resolved “to avoid the cost, burden, and risks of further litigation” and that the organizations “dispute these allegations on numerous grounds and deny having engaged in any wrongdoing or unlawful conduct.” As part of the agreement, the defendants will pay the District of Columbia a total of $750,000, which will be used to benefit three nonprofit organizations, the settlement paperwork says. “We’re resolving our lawsuit and sending the message that if you violate DC nonprofit law—no matter how powerful you are—you’ll pay,” Racine said in a tweet. In a statement, Trump blasted Racine and noted that the settlement includes no admission of guilt or liability. “As crime rates are soaring in our Nation’s Capital, it is necessary that the Attorney General focus on those issues rather than a further leg of the greatest Witch-Hunt in political history,"" Trump said. “This was yet another example of weaponizing Law Enforcement against the Republican Party and, in particular, the former President of the United States.” Racine has said the committee misused nonprofit funds and coordinated with the hotel’s management and members of the Trump family to arrange the events. He said one of the event’s planners raised concerns about pricing with Trump, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates, a top campaign official at the time. The committee has maintained that its finances were independently audited, and that all money was spent in accordance with the law. The committee raised an unprecedented $107 million to host events celebrating Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. But the committee’s spending has drawn mounting scrutiny. Gates, a former Trump campaign aide who cooperated in the special counsel’s Russia investigation, personally managed discussions with the hotel about using the space, including ballrooms and meeting rooms, the attorney general’s office has said. In one instance, Gates contacted Ivanka Trump and told her that he was “a bit worried about the optics” of the committee paying such a high fee, Racine said. Prosecutors say the committee could have hosted inaugural events at other venues either for free or for reduced costs but didn’t consider those options. ___ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.",Politics/Associated Press,DC reaches $750K settlement in Trump inaugural lawsuit,https://news.yahoo.com/dc-reaches-750k-settlement-trump-143257315.html

Wade, it will be a direct assault on freedom,"" Harris, a Democrat, told attendees at a gala hosted by Emily's List, an organization which works to get abortion-rights Democrats elected to office.

The Harris speech was planned before the leak of the ruling, but has taken on added meaning. Harris is a natural choice for the Biden administration to raise the issue on the midterm campaign trail if the Supreme Court adopts a version of the draft opinion and throws away five decades of federal protection of abortion rights.

5/4/2022,"Ukrainian officials said an attack on a key Russian command center in the eastern city of Izyum on Saturday evening killed about 200 Russian troops, including Maj. Gen. Andrei Simonov, but just missed hitting the chief of the general staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, who had just concluded a secret visit to the army and airborne command center. Earlier, unconfirmed reports suggested Gerasimov was wounded in the strike. Two U.S. officials tell The New York Times that Gerasimov had been in eastern Ukraine for the past couple of days, a rare step for Russia's top uniformed officer, but could not provide any information on the attack on School No. 12, Russia's Izyum command center. A senior Ukrainian official told the Times his country had learned of Gerasimov's visit to the front lines, but that the general was already returning to Russia when the rockets struck School No. 12. ""The decision to destroy this object was taken not because of Gerasimov, but because it is an important base of operations,"" the official said. Gerasimov is one of three key architects of Russia's Ukraine invasion, along with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. Putin sent Gerasimov to the front lines to ""change the course"" of Russia's underwhelming invasion, the Ukrainian official told the Times. ""Our working assumption is that he was there because there's a recognition they haven't worked out all their problems yet,"" a U.S. official confirmed. If the death of Maj. Gen. Simonov is accurate, he would be at least the 10th Russian general killed during Russia's Ukraine war. It's likely that more than a quarter of the 120 battalion tactical groups Russia committed to its invasion ""have now been rendered combat ineffective,"" Britain's Ministry of Defense said early Monday. ""Some of Russia's most elite units, including the VDV Airborne Forces, have suffered the highest levels of attrition. It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces."" In the Izyum strike, preliminary information indicates ""there are senior officers among the dead,"" Oleksiy Arestovych, a military adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, tells The Washington Post.

5/4/2022,"FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — Actor Amber Heard suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from violence she suffered at the hands of her ex-husband Johnny Depp, including multiple acts of sexual assault, a psychologist testified Tuesday. The sexual assaults included being forced to perform oral sex and having Depp penetrate her with a liquor bottle, the psychologist, Dawn Hughes, told jurors at Depp's libel trial against Heard. He accuses her of falsely claiming in a newspaper op-ed piece that she was a victim of domestic violence. Hughes' testimony contradicts that of a psychologist hired by Depp's lawyers, who said Heard was faking her symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered from borderline and histrionic personality disorders. Hughes disputed that Heard suffers from any personality disorder. Hughes was the first witness to take the stand on Heard's behalf after Depp's lawyers rested their case Tuesday morning. Hughes said there is corroboration of many of the instances of abuse, including apologies and admissions made by Depp to Heard and admissions he made to friends in text messages about his bad behavior when he drinks. In some cases, Heard told her therapists about the abuse contemporaneously, Hughes said. Depp has said he never physically attacked Heard, and that she was the aggressor who routinely hit him and threw things at him through the course of their relationship. Hughes, in her testimony, said Heard acknowledged that she did at times push and shove Depp, call him names and insult his parenting. But Hughes said there's a difference in the violence when a smaller person strikes at a larger person, and that Depp's violence was intimidating and threatened her safety, but Heard's violence did not have the same effect on Depp. “That's just physics; that's just proportional force,” she said. Much of the violence, Hughes said, stemmed from Depp's obsessive jealousy. He insisted she avoid nude scenes, if she worked at all, and accused her of affairs with actors Billy Bob Thornton and James Franco. If she did work on a film, Depp would call the director and others on set and say he “had eyes” there who would report to him if she fraternized improperly, Hughes said. And Heard, who identifies as bisexual according to treatment notes introduced at trial, also faced scrutiny in her interactions with women. Hughes said Depp on one occasion manually penetrated Heard in anger after witnessing Heard's interactions with a woman. “Amber got accused of women hitting her, and she got accused of men hitting on her,” Hughes said. Heard blinked back tears, and her lips and chin quivered at times as Hughes described the abuse. Hughes said she based her testimony on 29 hours of interviews with Heard, as well as interviews with her therapists and a review of court documents. Earlier Tuesday, Depp's lawyers rested their case, and a judge rejected a motion from Heard's lawyers to dismiss the case. Heard's lawyers argued that Depp had failed to make his case as a matter of law and that no reasonable jury could find in his favor. But the judge, Penney Azcarate, said the standard for dismissing a case at this point in the trial is exceedingly high, and that the case should be allowed to move forward if Depp has provided even a “scintilla” of evidence backing up his claims. Depp and his lead lawyer, Benjamin Chew, patted each other on the back after the judge ruled the case can proceed. Chew argued that the jury has a wealth of evidence to conclude that Heard falsely accused Depp of abuse. In fact, he said, the evidence shows that “Ms. Heard physically abused him. She's the abuser.” Heard's lawyer, J. Benjamin Rottenborn, said the evidence is clear over the last three weeks of testimony that Heard's allegations of abuse are truthful. “We haven’t gotten to put on our case yet,” he said. “This is all evidence that has come in while plaintiff controls the playing field.” Depp is suing Heard for $50 million in Fairfax County Circuit Court after Heard wrote a December 2018 op-ed piece in The Washington Post describing herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse.” The article never mentions Depp by name, but Depp’s lawyers say he was defamed nevertheless because it’s a clear reference to abuse allegations Heard levied in 2016, in the midst of the couple’s divorce proceedings. The judge on Tuesday did say she's reserving judgment on whether the article's headline in online editions should be part of the libel lawsuit because she said the evidence is unclear at this point whether Heard wrote the headline or is responsible for it. The online headline reads, ""I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change."" Hughes will be cross-examined Wednesday, and Heard is expected to take the stand Wednesday as well.",U.S./Associated Press,Depp trial: Psychologist testifies actor assaulted Heard,https://news.yahoo.com/depp-libel-suit-moves-ahead-171715396.html
