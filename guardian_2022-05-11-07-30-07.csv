5/11/2022,"The family sifts through childhood photos and marvels at the happiness. “Carefree … Look at your little tummies,” says his mother. His father feels the need to put them away. “So much waste. So much joy, so much potential … Such a waste that he’s gone now.” They are the parents of the singer Will Young, who found fame in 2002 as the charming and worthy winner of Pop Idol, and his twin, Rupert. They are looking through photos of the boys as part of a moving documentary about Rupert, who killed himself last year after enduring anxiety, depression and alcoholism for more than 20 years. Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert (Channel 4) is a rare beast: a celebrity documentary that has an articulate subject, an affecting story and a sense of mission. Often, films in this genre induce an uncomfortable sense that the makers are exploiting grief, or that the celebrity is in need of cash or a kind person to tell them that some pain is best worked through behind closed doors. For various reasons, the Youngs have taken the decision to speak out and to try to help others dealing with the terrible effects of alcoholism. “I’d like to know the moment it went wrong, as we go through his life,” says the twins’ father, quietly, beside the dining table strewn with photos. The programme suggests possibilities – foremost among them the boys’ traumatic experiences at boarding school, of which the parents knew nothing for years – but there can be no definitive answers. We learn that Rupert’s suicide attempts began at 18 – “cries for help,” says Will. There are accounts of late-night calls from police, cleaning sofas Rupert urinated on while blacked out, paying for repeated rehab stays, brief flares of hope in sober stretches, despair as he declined again and again. By the end, he was living in his twin’s house, with Will as his carer. Will cleaned up the sick every morning and helped Rupert go to the toilet, not knowing “what more I could do”. Rupert would knock on neighbours’ doors asking for money and pass out outside the newsagent. Eventually, the police came knocking with the news that Rupert had killed himself. The film does not take the easy, reductive path of comparing the brothers’ lives. Instead, their stories are supplemented by candid, dignified interviews with others who have experienced alcoholism. These are conducted beautifully by Will; his self-effacing manner allows them plenty of space, while he brings in his own travails only when pertinent and supportive. Melissa Rice is four years sober and works to get others the help that saved her after six years of hard drinking that “piled shame on top of shame”. She can’t forgive herself for what she put her mother through. “There weren’t really that many times when I resented [Rupert],” Will tells her. “Now, I’m just grateful I had 42 years with him.” Their conversation seems genuinely to help both parties. It is the same when Will meets Natalie Needham, the organiser of the lockdown art-therapy project Stitch Away the Stigma. The last time she saw her alcoholic father was when she had him arrested and removed from her grandma’s house, effectively making him homeless. “The last thing I did was hit my brother,” Will reassures her. “I don’t have a problem with it. He deserved it.” Losing My Twin Rupert also includes what feels like an increasingly necessary reference in medical programmes to the enormous difficulty in accessing professional help and care. Young is explicit about having been able to pay for Rupert’s many private rehab visits – and the inability of most of Britain’s estimated 1.6 million alcoholics and their loved ones to do so. The academic and practising psychiatrist Prof Julia Sinclair is explicit about the barriers to state-funded care (“Many things in the system are now broken”), noting that there are just five inpatient units left in the country, meaning desperate people are left searching for answers in ever-contracting circles. This film is an unflinching portrait of 20 years of sadness that acknowledges the complexity around addiction with compassion and courage. Almost all such endeavours claim to want to reduce stigma. It is rare for it to feel as though they might do so. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

5/11/2022,"Apple has discontinued the iPod more than 20 years after it was launched. The most recent iteration of the music player, the iPod Touch, has not been updated since 2019, and many of its features are now available on other products. Apple said it would continue to sell the Touch, the only generation of the iPod still on sale, “while supplies last”. The iPod was released in 2001, and was the first MP3 player capable of storing 1,000 songs. Aside from the Touch, versions included the iPod mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle. By 2011, Apple held a 70% global market share in MP3 players, and to date more than 400m iPods have been sold. The company stopped selling the Nano and Shuffle, its last standalone music players, in 2017, and industry experts had long predicted the Touch would follow given the prevalence of the iPhone and other smartphones that can be used to listen to music. Later versions of the Touch increasingly resembled smartphones, allowing users to take photos, send emails and make video calls. In a statement announcing the discontinuation, Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, said the “spirit of iPod lives on”. “Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry – it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared,” he said.",News/Technology,‘The spirit lives on’: Apple to discontinue the iPod after 21 years,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/the-spirit-lives-on-apple-to-discontinue-the-ipod-after-21-years
5/11/2022,"As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily. China is a major nuclear power. “It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”. “I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster. Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’ “I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.” In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?” Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”. Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”. At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. “Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.” “His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”",News/US news,"Trump inquired if China could make hurricanes to harm US, ex-officials say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes
5/11/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said his unpopular decision to cancel his squad’s day off allowed him to clear the air with his players after Chelsea’s disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves. Chelsea are at risk of losing their place in the top four after a poor run and the mood did not improve when the players were told to report to the training ground last Sunday. However, Tuchel said he was not looking to punish his side for blowing a 2-0 lead against Wolves and was trying to raise spirits before the world champions visit Leeds on Wednesday evening. “We planned a free day but after the disappointment it was not to punish them,” the Chelsea manager said. “Maybe some felt it was a punishment. It wasn’t. It was not the moment for a free day; it is better to be together and talk about it. We did very light training, had a run together and discussed things. “I think most of them expected a 30-minute teamtalk and then to watch the game again. Once they understood why they were here I get the feeling most of them accepted it and even looked up for it because there was an Under-23 game at one o’clock and I think two-thirds of the team stayed and watched it. “Nobody was getting in their car and getting away as early as possible. They take their responsibility – that is what I love about the team. It’s not like they arrived here with closed faces.” Tuchel, who denied reports of a row with Marcos Alonso during half-time against Wolves, said the session helped Chelsea prepare for Leeds. “I also cancelled my free Sunday,” he said. “But this happens. If you want to be loved on a daily basis you should not become a football coach. Everybody was here and the reaction was very nice. We used the Sunday morning to go over it so we had the Monday free for training. We just cleared the air.” With Todd Boehly’s consortium close to completing its takeover of Chelsea, Tuchel suggested the sanctions on Roman Abramovich had dented his team’s edge and that the impending departures of Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen on free transfers to Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively had taken a toll. Chelsea, who face Liverpool in the FA Cup final on Saturday, are close to being under new ownership. It is expected Boehly’s consortium will keep Bruce Buck as chairman and Marina Granovskaia could remain at Chelsea, who face Liverpool in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Continuity could ease Chelsea’s transition. They are unable to sell or buy players and are behind when it comes to summer planning. “You need to be careful with long-term plans at Chelsea,” Tuchel said. “You can end up that it’s not your plan any more. So a long-term plan is two or three matches. It’s high-level sport. You need to love where you are. I can just say for me everything is here. That’s why I dig in. “There’s no other way. Things are a bit more uncomfortable and things are like since a long time now where you wish sometimes: ‘Can we not just have a positive message now for everybody?’ “If you don’t get it, you don’t get it. It’s like in a football match sometimes that you have to suffer, suffer, suffer. We have the feeling we get punished for not a lot. Even with results. It’s like: ‘It’s not enough to be already sanctioned?’ You keep on going. Then hopefully it lasts for a long time.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel cancels Chelsea squad’s day off to hold clear-the-air talks,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/thomas-tuchel-cancels-chelsea-day-off-clear-the-air-talks
5/11/2022,"Frank Lampard believes keeping Everton in the Premier League would be bigger than winning the title as a player given the stakes involved, and admits his managerial reputation has been on the line since he replaced Rafael Benítez in January. Lampard has become so consumed by the challenge of securing Everton’s top-flight status, and avoiding the financial disaster of relegation, that he considers it more important than the three Premier League titles he won during a glittering career with Chelsea. Everton visit relegated Watford on Wednesday hoping to record back-to-back away wins for the first time this season and Lampard has urged his players to seize the opportunity. “When you live this experience of a relegation battle it so consumes you and you so want the right thing because you understand what the stakes are,” he said. “The stakes for this are bigger for me now than when I won the Premier League as a player because of what it means to the club. “You know the economics of it are greater as well, to a different degree, and you know what it means to the fans and the people who work here. There shouldn’t be any way, with four games to go and one point out of the relegation zone, that you think you are fine. We’ve got a big job to do still.” Everton have dragged themselves out of the relegation zone with a more resilient, pragmatic style in recent games and Lampard accepts his coaching ability was under scrutiny from the moment he arrived. “There are a lot of questions of everybody when you are in this position, and I came into it,” he said. “The players are questioned, the club is questioned, I’m questioned. It’s the cutting-edge part of the job in that position. I’m having an incredible experience – again, I am not talking like it is done, we are in it still – but I came here and people wanted to challenge me. “At Derby we had probably 60% possession, high press, and Chelsea 60-70% possession, high press. That was the way I set up as a coach. Then in the last three games we are working at 25-30% possession, organising the team, getting a result, seeing the reaction, and that’s been an incredible challenge in a good way.” Lampard, who expects to be without the influential defender Yerry Mina for the next three games because of a calf injury, admits he is glad he did not hold out for an easier job. “I possibly could have waited,” he said. “I could have sat on my arse and done the bins at home for another six months. That has actually seemed quite appealing a couple times in the last few months! But it’s how I’ve been all my career. You build up a thicker skin as you go along, and you get excited by challenges. “If I had been somewhere else waiting I wouldn’t be experiencing 3,300 fans perform like they did the other day [at Leicester], or coming to the training ground or turning up for the Chelsea game. The feeling of that, this club and understanding how big it is, and what it is on the line here, has been a really huge thing for me.”",Sport/Football,Keeping Everton in Premier League would top winning titles for Lampard,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/keeping-everton-in-premier-league-would-top-winning-titles-for-lampard
5/11/2022,"Jürgen Klopp had performed his triple fist pump in front of the travelling Liverpool support. The manager’s pulse was still racing but the emotion was elation now – perhaps a bit of relief – rather than high stress. And then, as he prepared to disappear off down the tunnel, he glimpsed his match-winner. Sadio Mané had operated largely on the fringes. The striker had flashed one header wide and seen another effort pulled back for offside against Luis Díaz. But on 65 minutes, Mané sensed his opportunity. And how he made it count. On current form, you can only keep him out for so long. It was Díaz up the left, teasing Tyrone Mings before crossing, but the goal that settled this high-octane game and thrilled the entire nation (only joking, Pep) was all about the movement and ingenuity of Mané. He ghosted into space before shaping his body to fashion the power in the header. Emiliano Martínez had no chance. Nor did Mané when Klopp got hold of him in the victory celebrations. There was a big bearhug before Klopp fixed him in a headlock, manhandling him playfully from the scene. Mané had seen a late effort cleared from in front of the line by Matty Cash but his eighth goal in 11 games proved the difference. Liverpool deserved the win that returns the pressure on to Manchester City ahead of the Premier League leaders’ visit to Wolves on Wednesday night, although it was not easy. They needed Alisson to make a few saves, including two to keep out Danny Ings. The first came after the Aston Villa forward had taken a heavy touch; the second on 84 minutes when Ings made ground to the right of goal, the angle tight. Villa were excellent for the opening half-hour. They scored early through Douglas Luiz and they hardly lay down thereafter. It was a night when Klopp rested Andy Robertson and used Jordan Henderson, Thiago Alcântara and Mohamed Salah only as substitutes. Liverpool had enough to get the job done, the win characterised by rising levels of control and, also, them digging in when needed. The only blot was the hamstring injury that forced off Fabinho midway through the first half. Henderson’s arrival for him coincided with Liverpool tightening their grip. Not that Villa were ever out of it on a night when the tempo rarely dropped and the referee, Jon Moss, struggled to keep up. He enraged the Villa fans throughout and there were times when it was difficult to predict his next decision. Would the Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, force a slip from his beloved Liverpool? After their home draw with Tottenham on Saturday, the away side could ill afford another one. Gerrard could be proud at how his team played, especially at the outset when they were quick and committed. And deserved their lead, which had Klopp stunned. It was Ollie Watkins who first got in around the back of the Liverpool defence, on to a high ball from Tyrone Mings and, when he cut inside and unloaded, Alisson had to make a smart save. Villa recycled and Douglas Luiz just seemed to want it more than his markers when he attacked Lucas Digne’s cross. Alisson pushed the effort out, without real conviction and, with players on the floor, including Konstantinos Tsimikas and Joël Matip, Douglas Luiz had a simple finish. Liverpool’s response was immediate and the equaliser followed more loose defending, Mings erring this time, getting a Trent Alexander-Arnold free-kick stuck under his studs. Matip challenged, Diogo Jota went in and the ball broke to Virgil van Dijk, who shot and watched Martínez throw out a hand. Matip was on hand to prod home and it was fair to say that the touchpaper had been lit. Villa brought a rare intensity and it rattled Liverpool, especially their defenders. Alisson shanked a clearance straight at Watkins and was fortunate to get away with it while Ings had to do better when he rose to meet a whipped John McGinn cross. It was not Ings’ night. Liverpool came to worry Villa with their interchanges and overloads up the flanks and they had chances before the interval, ending the period in the ascendancy. Mané flickered but the big chance was created by Díaz and Alexander-Arnold for Naby Keïta. Unmarked 10 yards out and centrally placed, he completely missed his kick. Curtis Jones also shot straight at Martínez. Gerrard and Klopp both sprinted for the tunnel at half-time, a neat reflection of the urgency of the contest, and it did not relent in the second half. Liverpool pressed and probed, Alexander-Arnold almost releasing Díaz with a lovely ball over the top. Moments earlier, Alexander-Arnold had bent a free-kick just past the angle of post and crossbar; after it, he whistled another one wide. Ings played in Watkins and Tsimikas had to be quick to get across but Liverpool were in control, threatening the next goal. It came when the 62nd-minute substitute Carney Chukwuemeka played Luiz into trouble and Thiago, also on by now, pounced. He won the ball and found Jota, who moved it to Díaz. Danger. Mané’s header was a beauty.",Sport/Football,Sadio Mané completes comeback at Aston Villa to keep Liverpool in title race,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
5/11/2022,"The Kentucky parents who have drawn criticism for running a marathon with their six-year-old son said that child protective services have since made an unannounced visit to their home to interview their children. Ben and Kami Crawford shared a photo of their youngest child, Rainier, purportedly being interviewed by a staffer from the state’s CPS department after an Instagram post detailing the boy’s at time arduous journey in completing the Flying Pig Marathon in Cincinnati earlier this month. “Yesterday Child Protective Services (CPS) arrived at our home unannounced and interviewed our children, parents & grandmother,” the family’s statement on Instagram read. “This is a scary process because usually children are interrogated away from parents, against their will, and their answers determine the agency’s legal right to take away the kids.” Campbell county district attorney Steve Franzen confirmed to ABC’s Good Morning America that Kentucky’s CPS visited the Crawford family, but said no ruling had been made yet in the investigation. The Crawfords, who run a website and YouTube channel, made headlines last week after sharing that Rainier ran the Flying Pig Marathon on 1 May, saying that “he was struggling physically and wanted to take a break and sit every three minutes” at mile 20. In an Instagram post on 3 May, the Crawfords said Rainier “was crying and we were moving slow” so he was promised two sleeves of Pringles if he kept going. “I had to promise him another sleeve to get him in the family pic at the finish line. Today I paid him off,” reads the Instagram post, showing Rainier holding the chips. According to the Crawfords, their five older children finished the race an hour ahead of them, while the parents and Rainier all crossed together at eight hours and 35 minutes. They have stood by their decision to run the marathon with their youngest son despite the vocal backlash from “an elite group of runners that are using their large platforms to police running for everyone, citing outdated research, and inbred rhetoric to stop others from enjoying it”. “The real stuff that we got accused of was dragging Rainier, like physically dragging him on the marathon course after mile 13 and across the finish line,” Ben Crawford said in a video posted on Saturday, defending the family against allegations of child abuse. “If you guys have seen our finish line picture, we all held hands for like the last probably, like, 0.2, 0.3 miles,” he added. “We talked about it ahead of time, like that’s what we’re going to do.” Crawford stated his son “had the option” to run and “begged” them to do so. “I don’t know if I should be angry,” he said. “I like to believe that people are doing the best that they can. They’re not trying to ruin our life or, you know, they probably are legit afraid for our kids. But also, it’s like, where’s the line?” Iris Simpson Bush, the executive director of the Flying Pig Marathon, took “full responsibility” for the decision to allow Rainier to run and called it “not the best course of action” in a statement issued last week.",Sport/Sport,Parents of six-year-old marathoner reveal child protective services visit,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/six-year-old-marathon-runner-kentucky
