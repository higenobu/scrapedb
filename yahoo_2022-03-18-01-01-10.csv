3/18/2022,"By Oliver Hirt and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland's secretive banks hold up to $213 billion of Russian wealth, the country's financial industry association estimates, as sanctions on Russia give a rare glimpse inside Swiss vaults. The Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) estimated that the banks hold between 150 billion and 200 billion Swiss francs ($213 billion) of Russian client money in offshore accounts. This indicates that the extent of wealthy Russians' business with banks in Switzerland, the world's biggest centre for offshore wealth, is far more extensive than the on-balance sheet exposures several of its financial firms have begun to detail. The SBA's revelation is rare for Switzerland, which has stone-walled many previous transparency requests, and comes as it took the unusual step of applying European Union sanctions to Russian cash following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last month. There is growing Swiss public debate about its role, with Mattea Meyer, co-president of the Social Democrats, calling for Switzerland to clamp down on any cash belonging to Russians close to President Vladimir Putin and his government. ""Part belongs to oligarchs loyal to the Kremlin. The money and their activity ... helps finance the war,"" she said, adding that Switzerland ""must do everything possible to turn off the money taps"". The SBA estimate, which dwarfs initial indications of the credit exposure to Russia, makes clear the scale of the task of imposing sanctions, such as by freezing the cash. The Swiss economy ministry said that it had no meaningful estimates on frozen Russian assets as it tallies reports from banks facing a growing Swiss sanctions list. Despite its Russian tally estimate, the SBA stressed that this was small compared to overall assets held in Switzerland, which has been regarded by generations of wealthy individuals from around the world as a safe haven for their money. ""The share of assets held for Russian clients likely accounts for a share in the low single-digit percentage range of the total cross-border assets deposited with Swiss banks,"" it said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday, referring to money held for clients residing abroad. RUSSIAN RISK As Western governments unleash a growing list of sanctions in response to Russia's invasion, banks are seeing their business with Russian clients scrutinized far beyond the loans they have granted or business done out of Russian subsidiaries that could lead to balance sheet losses. Analysts have said direct Swiss bank exposures to Russian clients look manageable, based on what has been made public. Switzerland's two biggest banks last week detailed ""limited"" exposures to Russia, with the largest UBS saying a $634 million direct exposure had been cut since year-end. Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein on Tuesday said some 4% of the assets Switzerland's second-biggest bank manages for wealthy clients belong to Russians, amounting to tens of billions of dollars. That is far greater than the 848 million Swiss franc net credit exposure in Credit Suisse's annual report. While the bank has not provided an updated tally, it managed 827 billion francs in its wealth management businesses at end-2021, so 4% would amount to some 33 billion Swiss francs in assets associated with Russian customers. UBS and Switzerland's third-largest listed lender, Julius Baer, have declined to detail assets they hold for Russian customers, but UBS CEO Ralph Hamers indicated sanctions were keeping the country's biggest bank busy. ""New lists come out every night,"" he said, adding that UBS was looking to shield not only against current compliance but also against the risk of future penalties.

3/18/2022,"By Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao LONDON (Reuters) -Russia said on Thursday it had made debt payments that were due this week but the announcement did not end a wait for what could be Moscow's first default on external borrowing in more than a century as several creditors said funds had yet to be received. Russia was due to pay $117 million in coupon payments on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds, widely seen as the first test of whether Moscow will meet its obligations after Western sanctions hobbled its financial dealings. It has a 30-day grace period from Wednesday's deadline. Sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have cut Russia off from the global financial system and blocked the bulk of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, while Moscow has in turn retaliated - all of which complicate payments. Russia's finance ministry said on Thursday its order to pay the $117 million had been fulfilled and said it would update the market separately on whether the payment was deposited into the account of payment agent Citibank. Citi's branch in London declined to comment. But a number of creditors and sources familiar with the situation in Asia and Europe said the funds had yet to be received by holders of the bonds. Two market sources told Reuters that Russia had made a transfer to the correspondent bank, which they named as JPMorgan, but said it was not immediately clear if those funds had been moved to Citi to pay bondholders because of restrictions related to U.S. sanctions on Russia. JPMorgan declined to comment. ""Russia may have wired money to pay but it's possible that the transfer agent and custodian are playing hardball,"" one person said, saying Western banks were increasingly wary of dealings with Russia and might be reluctant to send funds. The finance ministry had planned to send the equivalent interest payment amount in roubles if dollar payments did not reach foreign bondholders, something credit rating agency Fitch said would constitute a sovereign default, if not corrected within a 30-day grace period. Generally, a country would pay creditors abroad by sending money to a correspondent bank, which transfers the funds to the paying agent of the security, in this case Citi, before it goes to individual holders' deposit accounts through settlement steps to confirm ownership of assets. NAVIGATING SANCTIONS The raft of international sanctions have raised questions about whether such complex and multi-step transactions would run into difficulties, not least because Russia's central bank is among those institutions targeted in Western sanctions. ""The fact is that from the very beginning we have said that Russia has all the necessary funds and potential to prevent a default - there can be no defaults,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a daily briefing on Thursday. ""Any default that could arise would have an entirely artificial character,"" Peskov said. Russia has 15 international bonds with a face value of about $40 billion outstanding, roughly half held by foreign investors. The coupon payments due on March 16 are the first of several, with another $615 million due over the rest of the month. The first principal payment is due on April 4 when a $2 billion bond matures. The bonds have a mix of terms and indentures. Bonds sold after Russia faced sanctions for its 2014 annexation of Crimea contain a provision for alternative currency payments. Those listed after 2018 have roubles as an alternative currency option. A so-called non-payment event could trigger Russian debt default insurance policies known as Credit Default Swaps (CDS) that investors take out for this kind of situation. JPMorgan wrote in an earlier note that it estimated there were roughly $6 billion worth of outstanding CDS that would need to be paid out. A committee that examines whether or not CDS payouts are due is scheduled to meet later on Thursday. It was not immediately clear what was precisely on the agenda for the committee, which is made up of top banks and funds involved in the CDS market. The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said on March 2 it had authorised transactions for U.S. persons for ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity"" issued by Russia's finance ministry, central bank or wealth fund, but the exemption runs out on May 25. Russia is due to pay nearly $2 billion on its external sovereign bonds after that May 25 deadline and until year-end.

3/18/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Nickel fell by the maximum allowed for a second day as the market seeks to reset from last week’s historic short squeeze, while brokers were left stunned as yet another glitch delayed the start of trading in London. Most Read from Bloomberg Putin Vows to Rid Russia of ‘Traitors’ While Waging Ukraine War Richest Russian Built NYC Power Over Decades and Lost It in Weeks Ukraine Update: U.S. House Set to Revoke Russia’s Trade Status U.S. Is Sending Dive-Bombing Switchblade Drones to Ukraine Shock Waves From War in Ukraine Threaten to Swamp Sri Lanka Nickel futures on the London Metal Exchange plunged by the 8% daily limit on Thursday to $41,945 a ton, although only a handful of trades were recorded. Prices dropped by the previous 5% floor on Wednesday when the market opened from a week-long suspension imposed to try and restore order to the market after an unprecedented spike in nickel caused chaos across the metals industry. The latest price drop brings the LME prices a little closer to the value of futures in Shanghai, which continued to trade during the London suspension. It’s also another indication that the short squeeze that has gripped the nickel market may be easing. Prices had spiraled up 250% in a little more than 24 hours early last week as top producer Tsingshan Group Holding Co. struggled to pay margin calls on its large nickel short position. The Chinese company announced a deal with its banks on Monday to avoid margin calls, which gave the LME confidence to reopen the market, and most traders and analysts had predicted prices would fall when trading resumed. “It has become all but inevitable to have another round of limit-down for LME nickel as well, for at least for another 3 days if we are to follow the adjusted 8% pace,” Marex said in a note before the London open on Thursday. However, while the drop in prices was expected, the reopening of the London market has been anything but predictable. After a series of false starts on Wednesday that left exhausted traders exasperated with the LME, the problems started back up on Thursday even before trading had begun. Speaking privately on Thursday morning, several investors and brokers said they were stunned by the repeated blunders. One usually garrulous hedge fund manager said he was lost for words. First, traders found that orders to sell at the lower-limit of 8% below Wednesday’s closing price were being rejected, after the LME expanded the trading band the previous day. Then three trades did appear to go through at that price -- but four minutes before the electronic market had been due to open. Finally, the LME informed brokers that trading wouldn’t restart until 8:45 a.m. and canceled the three earlier trades. When the electronic-trading market finally opened, futures dropped by the daily limit. But only two trades had taken place by 2 p.m. The chaotic start to the session piles embarrassment on the LME as it seeks to restore order to the market that sets global prices for one of the world’s most important metals. The crisis in nickel has sparked furious criticism of the exchange for its handling of the situation, from metals markets veterans as well as generalist investors, and several have said they will stop trading on the market. “Credibility is very quickly slipping through their fingers,” Keith Wildie, head of trading at Romco Metals, said by phone from London. “It’s eroding very rapidly.” On Wednesday morning, the LME briefly restarted electronic trading in nickel, but was forced to halt due to a technical glitch that allowed prices to fall below a 5% lower limit. It reopened in the afternoon, but there was a gulf between bids and offers for most of the day, leading to highly illiquid trading conditions in the world’s benchmark pricing venue for the metal used in stainless steel and electric-vehicle batteries. The LME widened the limit from the initial reopening level of 5% for nickel to 8% on Thursday, in an attempt “to further assist the market to discover the true market price.” While electronic trading has faced glitches, the exchange is still operating its large phone-based market, which tends to be used by banks, brokerages and institutional clients needing to place large and complex trades. Its open-outcry floor -- where dealers gather on red leather couches to set benchmark prices by screaming orders at one another -- also remains open. Still, across the market, there has been little interest to buy at the limit-down price. And for a second day on Thursday, a huge volume of nickel was offered for sale, suggesting prices are poised to fall further. More than 13,000 lots, or 78,000 tons of nickel, had been offered as of 1:45 p.m. Read more: Nickel Bulls Are Taunted by a Huge Sell Order as Trading Reopens Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin U.S. Work-Permit Backlog Is Costing Immigrants Their Jobs Russia’s Brain Drain Becomes a Stampede for the Exits The 18 Minutes of Trading Chaos That Broke the Nickel Market A Wall Street Lifer’s Quixotic Quest to Build a Nonracist Bank ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 hours ago,Nickel Plunges as Traders Fume Over Latest London Metals Mayhem,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lme-nickel-traders-awake-fresh-081514283.html
