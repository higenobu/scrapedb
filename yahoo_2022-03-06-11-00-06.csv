3/6/2022,"WSB-TV reports several people in Atlanta have complained about suddenly discovering that they were completely out of gas, even after filling up their tank not too long ago. These car owners would later find out that someone drilled holes in the tank, and used a bucket to collect the precious gas, leaving them with nothing but a hefty bill to pay for the damages. “I’ve got almost $2,000 worth of damages, not just in the gas tank, but also damage the fuel pump, which is a pretty big issue,” one person said. Another person claimed to spot an individual on their Ring home doorbell camera getting into a silver SUV with what appeared to be a gas can in their hands. That homeowner later found out that they had also fallen victim to the gas bandit. These instances have occurred in four different neighborhoods in the Atlanta area. While police say they are investigating the matter, this behavior is most likely in response to the surging gas prices across the United States. Even though Georgia isn’t getting hit as hard as California where the average price of gas is nearing $5 per gallon, AAA reports the national average price for a gallon has soared by 11 cents to $3.72 over the last few days, per USA Today. The rising prices are a byproduct of the sanctions levied against Russia over the country’s invasion of Ukraine, De Haan of Gas Buddy told USA Today. These sanctions have limited Russia’s ability to sell crude oil, which has resulted in rising prices. President Joe Biden tried to assure the country last month that he will “do everything in my power to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.” The plan by the U.S. and its allies to release tens of millions of barrels of oil from reserves might not be enough to fix the situation.

3/6/2022,"“Star Trek” actor George Takei’s tweet asking Americans to endure paying a little more for food and gasoline as a result of sanctions President Biden imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine caught fire on Twitter Saturday — and that fire is as hot-headed as you probably suspected. “Americans: We can endure higher prices for food and gas if it means putting the screws to Putin,” Takei tweeted Friday. “Consider it a patriotic donation in the fight for freedom over tyranny.” Twitter users flocked to Takei’s tweet to express their opinion of his suggestion, with many bashing his perceived wealth in a “HE can endure higher prices” but the average working-class American cannot kind of way. On the opposite side of the argument, Takei’s supporters pointed out that he and his family were sent to Japanese internment camps in Arkansas and California during WWII, so he knows the repercussion of people remaining silent when they should be speaking up. “Everyone who is slamming George Takei for this tweet can get stuffed,” one user wrote. “He and his family endured internment in a Japanese camp in the US. He knows what happens when people look the other way, make excuses.” Several others expressed support in the same vein. “Guess what Americans?” another user tweeted. “We made plenty of home front sacrifices during WW2. Rationing, working in dangerous munitions factories etc. People were proud to do their patriotic duty. Now we whine about gas prices, not having Doritos on the shelves, wearing a mask. George Takei is right.” Here are some more tweets in support of Takei: Those who disagreed with Takei called attention to the history of oil and its connection to Putin, as well as Takei’s celebrity status and income. “There wouldn’t BE any need to “suffer” high gas prices if we hadn’t ended the Keystone pipeline, etc.,” a user tweeted. “The West MADE Putin a key source of oil in the past couple years, when we stopped being one ourselves. Think about it.” “The definition of trading your humanity for patriotism. George will be fine with higher food and gas prices, he’s worth $14 million,” another user wrote. “The poor and lower working-class in both countries want no part in wars, especially if it’s gonna add to the financial stress they already feel.” And then there were those that disagreed with Takei’s thoughts altogether: ""I know many of you won't be able to afford groceries and rent, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make for you""THANKS GEORGE. — Spoony Panda, Brave Little Spark (@spoony_panda) March 5, 2022 George Takei has more money in his bank account right now than most American families will earn in a lifetime.Of course HE can endure higher prices. https://t.co/UuYpBcrOC8 — Representative Mike Loychik (@MikeLoychik) March 5, 2022 Hey rich guy, you can endure this, but us working class people, this is crushing us. But what do you car looking down your nose at the people who make your world run… pic.twitter.com/fswIEOpqMX — Britt Griffith (@britttgriffith) March 5, 2022 Just remember that the guy who will never have to worry about whether he can afford to drive to work is telling you to make a donation with your money to benefit him.We could drop the price of gas in the US by increasing our production.And get rid of Russian oil. — Ross Schumann (@RossSchumann) March 5, 2022",U.S./The Wrap,George Takei’s Plea for Americans to Endure Higher Gas Prices to Put ‘the Screws to Putin’ Sets Off a Twitter War,https://news.yahoo.com/george-takei-plea-americans-endure-011822881.html
3/6/2022,"Russian forces attacked Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Friday. It prompted China to say it was ""gravely concerned"" about Ukraine's nuclear safety. The comments mark a break in China's apparent hesitancy to condemn Russia. China broke its silence on Ukraine to say it is ""gravely concerned"" about the safety of Ukraine's nuclear plants after Russia attacked one on Friday. Russian forces attacked and later seized Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant early Friday morning. Ukrainian officials said the attack caused a fire that was later subdued, and that radiation levels were stable. The attack prompted the Chinese foreign ministry to say it was concerned about Ukraine's nuclear safety and to urge ""calm and restraint"" by Russian forces, marking a departure from China's overall avoidance to comment on Russia's actions in Ukraine so far. ""China attaches great importance to nuclear safety and is gravely concerned about the safety and security situation of nuclear facilities in Ukraine,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a Friday press conference. ""We will continue to closely monitor the developments of the situation, and call on relevant parties to keep calm and exercise restraint, prevent further escalation of the situation and ensure the safety of relevant nuclear facilities."" China is one of the nine countries in the world recorded to have nuclear weapons. Beijing has avoided outright condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin since he launched a full invasion into Ukraine. Earlier this week, China abstained on voting at the United Nations to sanction Russia and demand the withdrawal of Russian troops. Last week, it also criticized Western nations for imposing sanctions on Russia over the invasion, saying that punishment never works. That being said, China has appeared to distance itself from Russia in recent days. On Monday, Wang told reporters that China and Russia were ""comprehensive strategic partners of coordination"" — a notable change from the Chinese foreign ministry's announcement just last year that the two countries were ""better than allies."" On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also told his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, that China ""regrets"" the Russia-Ukraine conflict, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
