12/10/2021,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — Australia's military said Friday it plans to ditch its fleet of European-designed Taipan helicopters and instead buy U.S. Black Hawks and Seahawks because the American machines are more reliable. The move comes less than three months after Australia canceled a deal to buy French submarines in favor of building nuclear-powered submarines that use U.S. and British technology in a switch that deeply angered France. Australia has 47 Taipan helicopters that were designed by Airbus and were supposed to last until 2037 but have been plagued with groundings. Australia will stop using them and buy 40 Lockheed Martin-designed helicopters in a switch that will cost 7 billion Australian dollars ($4.8 billion). Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia was improving its defense capabilities and had built good partnerships, particularly with the U.S. “The Taipans weren’t meeting their marks. Simple as that,” Morrison said. “And we want to make sure that our defense forces have the best possible equipment to defend this country, and the Black Hawks will provide that.” Defense Minister Peter Dutton said the Black Hawks are much cheaper to fly and that officials have had concerns about the Taipan program for the past decade. “It’s had nine instances where it’s been unsuitable to fly, and I’m just not going to put our people in that position,” Dutton said. He said the new helicopters would bring Australia’s fleet more in line with that of the U.S., an important consideration given the instability in the region. China has previously expressed anger over Australia's submarine switch and said it was irresponsible of the U.S. and Britain to export their nuclear technology. Opposition politicians said the Australian government had wasted billions of dollars on poor decisions around many of its defense contracts.",World/Associated Press,Australian military switches from European to US helicopters,https://news.yahoo.com/australian-military-switches-european-us-042650272.html
12/10/2021,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu were the closest of political allies during the four years they overlapped in office, at least in public. Not anymore. ""I haven’t spoken to him since,"" Trump said of the former Israeli prime minister. ""F**k him."" What he's saying: Trump repeatedly criticized Netanyahu during two interviews for my book, “Trump’s Peace: The Abraham Accords and the Reshaping of the Middle East."" The final straw for Trump was when Netanyahu congratulated President-elect Biden for his election victory while Trump was still disputing the result. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. ""The first person that congratulated [Biden] was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with. ... Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake."" Donald Trump Why it matters: Now opposition leader, Netanyahu is waging a continuous campaign to win back the Prime Minister's Office while on trial for corruption. One of his primary political calling cards is his close relationship with key players in U.S. politics, and with one man in particular who remains hugely popular in Israel: Trump. My interview with Trump will feature in a new season of Axios' ""How It Happened"" podcast, to be released on Monday. Subscribe. The big picture: For domestic political reasons, both Trump and Netanyahu cultivated the public perception that there was no daylight between them as they worked closely together on key issues. But by the end of his presidency, Trump had concluded that Netanyahu didn’t really want peace with the Palestinians and was using him on Iran. Trump also felt he'd helped ensure Netanyahu's political survival, but didn't get the same in return. He positively fumed about the video in which Netanyahu congratulated Biden. “I liked Bibi. I still like Bibi. But I also like loyalty. The first person to congratulate Biden was Bibi. And not only did he congratulate him, he did it on tape,"" Trump told me, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Reality check: Netanyahu was far from the first world leader to congratulate Biden. In fact, he waited more than 12 hours after the U.S. networks called the election. But Trump claimed he was shocked when his wife Melania shared Netanyahu's video with him: ""He was very early — like, earlier than most. I haven’t spoken to him since. F**k him."" The former president was fixated on the fact that while the likes of Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and Russia's Vladimir Putin held off — “they felt the election was rigged,"" Trump claimed — Netanyahu acknowledged Biden's win. “For Bibi Netanyahu, before the ink was even dry, to do a message, and not only a message, to do a tape to Joe Biden talking about their great, great friendship — they didn't have a friendship, because if they did, [the Obama administration] wouldn't have done the Iran deal,"" Trump said. ""And guess what, now they're going to do it again."" Setting the scene: Those remarks came during a 90-minute, face-to-face interview at Mar-a-Lago in April, during which Trump repeatedly contended that he'd done more for Israel and for Netanyahu than any other president. He cited his decisions to withdraw from the Iran deal, move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem, keep troops in the region and recognize the occupied Golan Heights as part of Israel. He noted that he announced the Golan Heights move ""right before the election"" in April 2019, when Netanyahu had been trailing in the polls. ""He would have lost the election if it wasn't for me."" Reality check: It's unclear whether the move actually swung the result of the election, which ended in a deadlock, but a poll conducted ahead of the vote by the Israeli Institute for Democracy found that 66% of Israelis thought Trump's decision strengthened Netanyahu’s stature.

Photo: Jack Guez/AFP via Getty 18 months later, when Trump held an on-camera call with Netanyahu 10 days before the U.S. election to mark the normalization agreement between Israel and Sudan, Trump asked Netanyahu whether ""Sleepy Joe"" could have cut such a deal. ""Mr. President, one thing I can tell you is we appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America,"" Netanyahu replied cautiously. Trump bristled. There were also more substantial disagreements between Trump and Netanyahu over Iran, Netanyahu's plan to annex parts of the West Bank, and Trump's desire for a peace deal with the Palestinians. Even as he criticized Netanyahu, Trump expressed some admiration for him as a politician. He also showed great interest in Netanyahu's legal troubles, though he said he'd never discussed them with Netanyahu himself. I spoke to Trump again in July, this time on the phone, after Netanyahu had been ousted from power after 12 years. ""Well, I like him, but he has been there a long time,"" Trump said when asked about Netanyahu's exit. Trump repeated his grievances with Netanyahu, albeit in a milder tone. “I can tell you that people were very angry with him when he was the first one to congratulate Biden,"" he said. ""The video was almost like he's begging for love. And I said, 'My, my how things change.' So, you know, I was disappointed. That hurt him badly with the people of Israel. As you know, I'm very popular in Israel. I think it hurt him very badly.""

12/10/2021,"Rudy Giuliani made an unsubstantiated claim that he has proof to validate the conspiracy theory that dead people voted in the 2020 election. Giuliani said he possesses 900 death certificates of people who died in 2000 but voted in 2020. However, Giuliani has not produced the evidence or said where he obtained said death certificates. Trump-allied lawyer Rudy Giuliani is once again saying that he possesses evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 election, claiming on Thursday night he had ""900 death certificates"" that prove dead people voted. Appearing on ""The Lindell Report,"" a program usually hosted by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, Giuliani told guest host Brannon Howse about the death certificates. ""Let's look at Georgia for a moment, Raffensperger, the Secretary of State, who until recently, was saying that it was a perfect election,"" Giuliani said, referencing Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. ""The idiot said to the president, it was a perfect election. He said to the president, you know, we looked and we couldn't find any dead people who voted."" ""I found 900 people whose death certificates I had, they all died in 2000, before the election,"" Giuliani said. ""I think the actual number our expert estimated was more in the range of about four or five or six thousand. But I had 900 death certificates. They're people who voted!"" ""Don't tell me it was a perfect election, then I know you're a damn liar,"" Giuliani added. During an earlier segment of the broadcast, Giuliani told Howse: ""You can't let 300 dead people vote, much less 6,000!"" Giuliani did not display the death certificates on-air and did not reveal where he had obtained them. Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. Other right-wing figures have also floated the conspiracy theory that dead people voted in the 2020 elections. Lindell, for instance, claimed without evidence in October that 23,000 dead people voted using a prison address. During his appearance on ""The Lindell Report,"" Giuliani also continued to push a variety of unsubstantiated election fraud theories. For one, Giuliani claimed that he had ""400 affidavits"" from people who witnessed election fraud. He cited the example of an unnamed ""very religious woman"" in Detroit, who he says told him that she witnessed election fraud. The former mayor of New York City also said, without substantiation, that he saw a video of people ""casing the joint"" at a vote-counting center in Georgia, likening it to videos he used to see when he used to ""prosecute bank robbers."" Since the 2020 election, Giuliani has consistently pushed and parroted baseless election fraud claims. This kicked off at a now-infamous press conference in November 2020 outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Pennsylvania, where Giuliani told reporters the Trump campaign planned to challenge the election in court while making baseless claims of election fraud. Giuliani was suspended from practicing law in New York in June, after a court found that there was ""uncontroverted evidence"" that he made ""demonstrably false and misleading"" statements on election fraud. He has also admitted under oath that he did not verify some of the election fraud claims that he parroted, and got the ""evidence"" from social media. Separately, Giuliani also told a Dominion Voting Systems lawyer that he ""didn't have the time"" to verify voter fraud claims about the 2020 election after he heard about them. Dominion is suing Giuliani and others who peddled baseless claims saying that the electronic voting company rigged the 2020 election in favor of President Joe Biden.

12/10/2021,"Erkan Aydin, a main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) deputy, asked Soylu why he used a plane belonging to a businessman accused of money laundering. Aydin produced a picture purporting to show the minister on the plane. ""You're lying! You are a liar!"" Soylu responded, triggering the scuffles between CHP and ruling AK Party (AKP) lawmakers. The turmoil in parliament reflected strains on the streets where many Turks have struggled to buy enough food and medicines, and saw their budgets upended, after the lira tumbled some 30% last month and inflation soared above 21%. A series of aggressive interest rate cuts sparked the market crash. Despite widespread criticism, President Tayyip Erdogan has backed the policy as part of a new economic program that he says stresses exports, credit and economic growth. Tensions also flared in parliament on Monday (December 6) when AKP lawmakers interrupted and insulted CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu over his criticism of the government's economic management, and his use of what looked like a hand gesture considered obscene.
