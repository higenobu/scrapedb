2/6/2022,"Bushfires are bearing down on the towns of Bridgetown and Denmark in southern Western Australia and homes are feared lost as the state braces for another day of hot and windy conditions. The ABC reported more than 150 firefighters were battling the fires at Denmark and Bridgetown on Sunday, with nearly 5,000 hectares burnt.  No property losses have yet been confirmed, but hot temperatures and unpredictable winds threaten to worsen the situation. In a Facebook post, the WA department of fire and emergency services said it had been a “hellish night” on Saturday. “Scores of firefighters spent a hellish night under pressure from variable winds, showers of embers and oppressive heat as they fought against a firestorm bearing down on our communities,” authorities said. “Their admirable efforts have made significant progress in Bridgetown and Denmark, but we’re not out of the woods yet.” Rapid damage assessment teams were working through the affected areas to determine property damage, and the department urged residents to be patient while firefighters still actively defended properties trying to contain the blazes. “There is no reprieve for the hundreds at work today on the ground and behind the scenes. Though the weather is easing for parts of the State, the situation in the emergency warning areas still remains dire. While some cooler weather is expected to arrive, many parts of the State still have a whole day before that unseasonal shift.” Residents of Hester, a small town west of the Margaret River, were told it was too late to leave. “It’s too late to leave, leaving now would be deadly,” Emergency WA said in a warning issued around 8am local time on Sunday. Aerial support has been sent to assist ground crews and police, and SES officers and ambulance personnel are also in attendance. Western Power said about 2,500 customers in the south-west and great southern regions were without power on Sunday due to the bushfire. Locals from those other areas have been warned it is too dangerous to return to their houses. People living in nearby of Shadforth, William Bay, Scottsdale, Parryville, Ocean Beach, Kentdale and Kordabup should evacuate the area immediately if they have not done so. “Variable wind behaviour continues to bring unpredictable fire conditions to the area,” WA Emergency said.

People required to quarantine should make other arrangements. If this is not possible, they can still head to the centre and notify staff when they arrive. Pets are not permitted at the centre unless they are assistance animals, but those unable to make other arrangements should make their way to the centre and follow directions. WA premier Mark McGowan on Saturday said multiple areas in the state continue to face “dangerous bushfire conditions with more hot weather forecast today and tomorrow”. The premier thanked firefighters for their efforts over the week, and urged the public to follow advice from Emergency WA. A number of bushfire advice warnings are in place across the state, with WA Emergency warning there is no threat to lives of homes at this stage.",News/Australia news,‘Threat to lives and homes’: WA residents flee as bushfires bear down on towns,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/threat-to-lives-and-homes-wa-residents-flee-as-bushfires-bear-down-on-towns
