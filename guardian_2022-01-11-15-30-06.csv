1/11/2022,"A Chinese developer previously considered financially sound is embarking on a fire sale of assets as the contagion of bad debts built up within China’s bloated housing sector continues to spread. Shimao Group Holdings, which is in the top dozen Chinese property companies, was plunged into crisis after it said it defaulted a trust loan last week after missing a 645m yuan ($101m) payment that it guaranteed.  Its situation worsened on Monday night when its credit rating was downgraded to junk status by S&P. After a wild few days of trading, its shares fell 17% on Friday, and then bounced back 20% on Monday amid reports of the fire sale, and then fell again on Tuesday by 5% when it tried to play down the speculation. Shimao denied in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Tuesday that it was selling its flagship Shimao International Plaza in Shanghai for more than 10bn yuan ($1.6bn), but did concede that some of its 455bn yuan ($71bn) of assets were up for grabs. The statement advised investors “not to rely on market rumours in relation to the group” and that “information should only be based on the company’s official announcement”. However, its financial plight was laid bare by a report from the credit rating agency S&P which said its liquidity was “weak” and that its cash position “will continue to erode for a prolonged period”. S&P moved Shimao to a rating of B-, considered junk status in financial markets and well below the top investment grade that it enjoyed only two months ago when it was one of the Chinese developers that passed the government’s “three red lines” test on borrowing. The red lines test were introduced by Xi Jinping’s government in Beijing in order to rein in what he sees as excessively risky and speculative borrowing in the property sector. By reducing the flow of cheap credit to developers, the tougher rules have set off a chain reaction throughout the industry, starting with China’s second-largest property developer Evergrande, which slipped into default on some if its $300bn debts in December. But despite official insistence that the problem is limited to a few duds, the contagion appears to be spreading and is being accelerated by falling house prices and sales. Logan Wright, director of China markets research at Rhodium Group in Hong Kong, said the fundamental problem facing the industry was that falling sales were depriving companies of cash to repay debts piled up in the good times. New home prices fell 0.3% month-on-month in November, the biggest decline since February 2015, and plunged 16.31% by sales value. “As long as sales continue to decline meaningfully, the risk is that any policy support may not arrive quickly enough to prevent additional defaults, and slowing construction activity and economic growth,” Wright said. “Local governments are facing declining revenues from land sales and they will not be able to offer much help to developers under growing financial pressures.” S&P estimated that Shimao needed to find 55bn yuan ($8bn) to repay onshore debt maturities this year and its deteriorating credit rating meant it would have to do so from “internal resources” rather than more borrowing. “The company is facing heightened refinancing risks due to still-tight regulatory conditions, apart from the materially weakened capital markets access,” S&P analysts wrote. “We don’t believe the company will be able to access capital markets in the next six months given the volatility in prices of its capital market instruments, both domestically and offshore. “While we don’t anticipate that banks will call for early debt repayment, given that bank loans are generally secured by project assets, such risk could increase as sales deteriorate. According to industry data, Shimao’s 2021 total contracted sales were about 270bn yuan ($42bn). This was at the lower end of our forecast … and reflected a more than a 60% year-on-year drop in contracted sales in December 2021.” Evergrande, meanwhile, said late on Monday that it had moved out of its Shenzhen headquarters to cut costs. The company also kept a glimmer of hope alive that its first onshore Chinese yuan bond default might still be avoided by extending until Thursday a deadline for bondholders to agree to a six-month, 4.5bn yuan ($157m) payment deferral.",News/World news,Chinese developer Shimao plans fire sale after downgrade and missed payment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/chinese-developer-shimao-plans-fire-sale-after-downgrade-and-missed-payment
1/11/2022,"“Thinking of Melville, thinking of Poe, thinking of Mark Twain and Vachel Lindsay, thinking of Jack London and Tom Wolfe, one begins to feel there is almost no way of becoming a creative writer in America without being a loser.” So declared the great Nelson Algren, gutter bard and patron saint of Chicago letters, a man who recognized the quiet dignity of loserdom and accepted more than a little of it for himself. He rose to the top of the literary demimonde during the 40s and 50s on his writing about societal cast-offs, rough-edged characters based on the people he met in dank bars, back rooms and street corners. In training his focus on those most preferred not to think about, Algren found a bruised nobility in the down-but-not-out subjects who considered him one of their own and became a national name for it. As his celebrity declined and his output waned, however, his legacy has somewhat diminished in comparison with that of peers like mutual admirer and friend Ernest Hemingway.  That’s where Michael Caplan, director of the new documentary Algren, hopes to come in. After more than a decade spent on a production interrupted by disappearing and reappearing funds, the professor/film-maker has completed his tribute to the enduring brilliance of a larger-than-life literary luminary. Caplan had a fortuitous encounter with cult-legend photographer Art Shay in 2008, who suggested that he take up Algren for a future project and offered a massive cache of up-close-and-personal photos as its basis. A completed cut screened for hometown audiences at the Chicago international film festival in 2014, only to gather dust on Caplan’s shelf for the rest of the decade, until the immobility of the pandemic lockdown compelled him to take action. He sculpted a fresh edit and with this week’s long-awaited digital release, he’ll make his bid to restore Algren’s name to the top of the writerly firmament. “I encountered Algren first through a used copy of Man with the Golden Arm, which I read in my early 20s and I was just blown away by it,” Caplan tells the Guardian over the phone from his home in the Windy City. “I’m from Chicago, I grew up in Chicago in a very middle-class working neighborhood by the steel mills. I knew a lot of people whose families were focused on just getting by, far from the American dream. Those were the kinds of people that Algren wrote about, so his work really struck me. I always felt like he was the embodiment not just of Chicago, but of mid-20th-century America coming out of World War II, when everything was supposed to be a Ford and white picket fence. It wasn’t like that for a lot of people and that’s what Algren wrote about.” Born to the lower half of the middle – “working-class, but not exactly poor”, Caplan explains – Algren grew up immersed in a grittier milieu than many of the well-heeled, well-educated celebrity scribes of the day. A proud product of the public school system, he planned to find work at a newspaper following his college graduation, but the Depression instead sent him on an eye-opening cross-country odyssey by freight train. During these lean days, he was pinched for purloining a typewriter from a Texas classroom and spent five rough months in the clink, during which he developed a deep identification with the assorted wretches he met there. “This introduced him to another America,” Caplan says. “That’s where the spark first happened.” Algren got involved with the Works Progress Administration established by the New Deal to aid jobseekers, ultimately meeting Studs Terkel, Richard Wright, and “a lot of writers telling the story of people on the underside” through the arts outreach of the Federal Writers’ Project. Stimulated by their high-minded company, he began to churn out a steady stream of short stories and novels about his originally chosen cohort: alcoholics, sex workers, drug users, boxers on the take, penny-ante criminals, corrupt politicos, anyone close to the howling desperation he could sense festering beneath the wholesome exterior of the United States. He shipped out to the European front of the second world war before his career hit its peak and returned to find that “he was certainly known as a guy who could both get an award from Eleanor Roosevelt and hang out with the bums on Skid Row”, as Caplan puts it. Though plenty of writers have fancied themselves mouthpieces of the people for taking a tour of poverty before retreating to their towers of privilege, Algren was dedicated to the squalor he stylized in his work. “To me, that’s what distinguishes him – his credibility,” Caplan says. “He really lived this life that he wrote about. He had a little apartment in Wicker Park, which was a slum mostly for Polish immigrants at the time, in almost a monastic lifestyle. He had a very stripped-down existence, and then he’d hang out at the bars where everyone knew him. This wasn’t checking a scene out for two weeks or a month. He was committed. This was his life. He hung out in high society, but to him, the real world was ‘behind the billboard’, as he said. If you didn’t know what was going on at the bottom of a society, you didn’t know what was going on, period.” While maintaining his connection to the dregs, the success of novels like The Man with the Golden Arm and A Walk on the Wild Side catapulted Algren to the top of society’s highest echelons. His involvement with the feminist trailblazer Simone de Beauvoir and the eventual love triangle formed with Jean-Paul Sartre, fictionalized in her novel The Mandarins, helped to solidify his outsized renown. But his fortunes waned as quickly as they rose, commercial success eluding him while his contemporaries continued thriving. He went into academia as finances tightened, considered going into the flourishing Vietnam black market and dodged his taxes as anti-war protest. In 1975, a sorely needed journalism assignment profiling a wrestler led him to Paterson, New Jersey. He fell in love with its serenity and left his beloved Chicago, leaving his mantle behind. He ended his life in a semi-obscurity that’s only grown with time. “Part of it is that America moved on,” Caplan explains. “They didn’t want to hear a story about the working class or poor. Saul Bellow was writing about middle-class people in Hyde Park and that became more desirable in that moment. Hemingway made sure that he always had a reputation as a tough guy, a guy’s guy, and Norman Mailer did the same. Even though, for a while, Algren had some of that image, he didn’t work at it so much. Once it passed, he didn’t go out and cultivate it, make sure people remembered him. He just wanted to write and thought that should be enough. Today, we know more clearly than ever that it’s not enough, people like to have an idea of the person.” Algren belonged to a generation of hard-drinking, brawling writers that’s long since gone extinct. His bare-knuckle hyper-masculinity renders him utterly alien to a more sensitive current publishing landscape and his public feuding has migrated to other pop-cultural spheres. Caplan floats hip-hop as a present-day equivalent to the heated literary scene of Algren’s era, chuckling before conceding that “there’s something to that!” at the suggestion that he could have been the Tupac of his day. The documentary takes a stance of prudent ambivalence to his lessened stock; he was a vital talent and crucial piece of the national literary tradition, but inextricably tied to his time and place in a way that the onward march of time doesn’t necessarily favor. Caplan readily acknowledges that for all his genius, the coarseness by which Algren defined himself keeps him planted in the past. “It’s a little bit tougher when you’re open to scrutiny,” he says. “That’s something I don’t think Algren would have done well with.” Algren is available to rent digitally in the US on 11 January with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,‘He really lived this life that he wrote about’: remembering Nelson Algren,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/11/he-really-lived-this-life-that-he-wrote-about-remembering-nelson-algren
1/11/2022,"A staple of the Australian diet is the latest victim of the Omicron crisis, as staff shortages hit Australia’s biggest chicken supplier and shelves go empty. The staff shortages have significantly cut sales at Ingham’s and made some products unavailable at one of its big customers, KFC.  Australians eat almost 47kg of chicken each a year, making it the country’s most popular meat, according to industry statistics. It is also the cheapest meat on the market – at an average of $5.43 a kilo it is less than half the price of pork, lamb and beef. “The rapid spread of the Omicron variant across eastern Australian states from December 2021 and the resulting staff shortages, are now also having a significant impact on the Australian supply chain, operations, logistics and sales performance of Ingham’s, and some of its suppliers and customers,” Ingham’s said in a statement to the ASX that sent its share price tumbling more than 6%. “This has disrupted production and distribution capability, and impacted sales.” Market sources said Ingham’s customers included KFC, which Guardian Australia has confirmed is suffering from a shortage of some products due to difficulty in obtaining fresh chicken pieces on the east coast. Staff shortages are worst in processing plants, where chickens are cut into pieces such as thigh and breast fillets. This has resulted in Ingham’s shipping more whole chickens to supermarkets and other retailers. Consumers have reported empty shelves in the chicken sections of supermarkets as shoppers clear out available stock. Bit bereft in the chicken aisle of the local Coles pic.twitter.com/8r60ldPwB3 Ingham’s said its main sites were open and “have not experienced significant on-site transmission of Covid”. “However, they are experiencing significantly lower levels of staff availability which is impacting production volumes and operational efficiency,” the company said. “Operational changes are being made to volume and mix across Ingham’s Australian business and it is not currently possible to predict how long this disruption will continue.” A KFC spokesperson said the fast food chain was “currently experiencing intermittent supply chain disruptions nationally due to Covid-19 related absenteeism at our chicken suppliers, meaning some of our restaurants are unable to offer our full menu which relies on fresh chicken”. “We’re working with our multiple suppliers to mitigate the impact and provide them with support, but we expect some disruptions to continue in the coming weeks.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ingham’s said it was too early to tell what effect the shortages would have on profit. Its managing director, Andrew Reeves, said many employees were “forced to isolate at home due to contracting Covid in the community or as a result of being close contacts”. He said a decision by state and federal governments which removed a requirement for asymptomatic close contacts who work in the meat industry to isolate for seven days “should assist to alleviate some of the current staff shortages”. “As operating conditions begin to stabilise, we expect our production capacity to recover relatively quickly to meet customer and consumer demand.” The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said workers in meatworks were particularly vulnerable to catching Covid-19. “There’s social distancing that’s been put in place but that is not enough with Omicron and inevitably if one person on that line gets sick and is infectious there’s a high chance, especially as we know because of that type of wet, cold environment, for it to spread as well,” she said.",News/Australia news,Chicken out of stock: meat in short supply on Australian supermarket shelves and at KFC,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/chicken-stock-omicron-shortages-australian-staple-off-supermarket-shelves

1/11/2022,"Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac is never far away. In February Martin Crimp’s radical adaptation, starring James McAvoy, returns to London, then tours to Glasgow and New York. Then follows the release of Joe Wright’s new movie, with Peter Dinklage in the lead. Although in both cases the actors eschew prosthetic adornments, you could say that the noses generally have it since Rostand’s “comédie héroïque” has been in regular revival since its 1897 premiere. I’ve seen close to a dozen productions over the past half-century and it’s been the source of multiple movies, at least three musicals and an opera. There was also in 2015 a gender-swapped version known as CyranA. So why does it endure? At its premiere, it was seen as a revolt against the prevailing naturalist drama. As Graham Robb has pointed out, it also had a topical resonance, coming at the time of the Dreyfus affair (the scandal in which army captain Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of treason): “the soft-hearted slasher was everybody’s hero – a man with alien features who suffered for his virtues but represented the society Dreyfus was supposed to have betrayed”. But there are other reasons for its continued popularity: it has a glorious theatricality, glittering poetry and boasts a big star part that has attracted actors as various as Ralph Richardson, Derek Jacobi and Antony Sher on stage and José Ferrer, Steve Martin and Gérard Depardieu on screen.  But I suspect there are deeper reasons for its survival. Since Cyrano lends his poetic genius to a dim-witted rival allowing him to woo the woman Cyrano himself loves, it is one of the great dramas of heroic self-sacrifice. It is a theme that never loses its popularity: contemporary with Cyrano was Sir John Martin-Harvey’s The Only Way, based on Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities. Henry James pointed out in 1901, discussing Rostand in The Scenic Art, that the novel “lives its hour mainly under favour of the romantic prejudice”. But while being shamelessly romantic, Rostand’s play is also a study of a fiercely independent spirit. Rostand’s Cyrano hates hypocrisy, defies authority and when he says – in Anthony Burgess’s translation – “You’ve no idea how bracing it is to go marching upright against a volley of venom”, I am reminded of Alceste in Molière’s The Misanthrope in his self-lacerating honesty. Mention of Burgess raises the eternal question of how to render Rostand’s poetry. Seeing the play in French in 1898, Max Beerbohm wrote that “to translate it into English were a terrible imposition to set any one” and even Henry James, who admired Rostand, wrote of “his merciless virtuosity of expression”. I’ve come across versions by Brian Hooker, Patrick Garland and Christopher Fry but Burgess’s, with its eclectic mix of rhyme, rhetoric and quasi-Joycean puns, finds a way to match Rostand’s virtuosity while Crimp clearly demonstrates that the play is also about the dangerous lure of language. In the introduction to his translation, Burgess makes the pragmatic point that a play’s first duty is “to feed the actors” and I’m struck by how various are the Cyranos I have seen. Edward Woodward, who played it for the National in 1970, offered us a moody introvert but one a little lacking in panache. By contrast Robert Lindsay, who donned the nose in a West End production in 1992, was all vigorous swash and buckle, putting one in mind of the screen heroics of Douglas Fairbanks. But, alongside McAvoy who offers a fierce, proud, free-thinking Cyrano in black leather, the two performances I remember best come from different RSC productions. Derek Jacobi played the role, with Sinéad Cusack as Roxane and Pete Postlethwaite as a versifying pastry cook, in Terry Hands’s 1983 production and it remains one of his finest hours. Jacobi had the right swagger and impetuosity but there was also a sweet-souled sadness to his performance. Asked if he had ever read Don Quixote, Jacobi replied “Read it? I’ve practically lived it” and there was something about his falling inflection that suggested a whole world of spiritual desolation. Antony Sher was Cyrano in Gregory Doran’s 1997 production and brought something entirely different to the part. Sher specialised in playing solitary outsiders and his Cyrano was a small, faintly bookish man who was aware of his own absurdity and who even donned specs to pen a love-letter to Roxane: a tiny touch echoed by Mark Rylance in Jerusalem when he too put on glasses as if to belie his character’s alleged wildness. Oscar Wilde said there are as many Hamlets as there are actors and much the same is true of Cyrano. But Jamie Lloyd, director of the current revival, hit a nerve when he said “the reason the play has endured is that we all have an insecurity, something we’re battling with”. Different actors may put more or less stress on Cyrano’s swordsmanship and showmanship but underneath this is a play about self-sacrifice and solitude, which is, perhaps, the real reason it has lasted for well over a century and in many different cultures. Jamie Lloyd’s production of Cyrano de Bergerac is at the Harold Pinter theatre, London, 3 February-12 March; the Theatre Royal Glasgow, 18-26 March; and at Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, 5 April-22 May",Arts/Stage,Never mind the nose: what makes Cyrano de Bergerac a hero for all time?,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/11/never-mind-the-nose-what-makes-cyrano-de-bergerac-a-hero-for-all-time
1/11/2022,"Back in the wild old days, my best buddy and I used to call going out “looking for trouble”. We weren’t hoping for a punch-up or a little light robbery, but a spontaneous adventure involving music, strangers or just the city at night. All that spur-of-the-moment fun has taken quite a beating since the pandemic began, for many millions of us. First came the lockdowns, social distancing and closed venues, then the cautious reopening when even a trip to the pub or an art gallery had to be booked weeks in advance. And now, just when it seemed the world was finally getting back to normal, Omicron has come wielding its everything’s-off-again sledgehammer, crushing all those dreams of nights out, holidays and raucous parties. Not only does it seem foolish to plan anything, but after two years of frustration and self-restraint, it’s hard to summon up the enthusiasm to do anything off the cuff. And that’s quite a loss. While we often think anticipation is half the fun, in 2016 researchers from two US universities found that people enjoyed activities more when they were impromptu. Scheduling a coffee break or a movie, for instance, made them feel “less free-flowing and more work-like”, wrote the authors. As Jane Austen put it 200 years ago in Emma: “Why not seize the pleasure at once? – How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!”  Masks don’t help, says Edward Slingerland, a philosophy professor at the University of British Columbia and the author of Trying Not to Try. “It’s difficult to get into any kind of relaxed, spontaneous rhythm when you can’t see the other person’s facial expressions. Our in-person interactions have been drained of the subtle facial cues that we normally use to tell if the other person is enjoying themselves or if a comment is landing the right way.” This renders even those precious interactions with strangers when out in the world so much harder. Video calls are equally unconducive. “You’re not in the same room. There’s often a subtle time delay that may not seem like very much, but it’s hard for people to know when you’re done talking, when it’s OK for me to start. It’s impossible to relax into natural, really positive social interactions that have spontaneity to them.” The good news is that, as counterintuitive as it sounds, you can work at being more spontaneous. For his book, Slingerland looked at how ancient Chinese thinkers tackled the problem. “It involved things like ritual activities, meditation, breathing practices or just trying to trick your mind into forgetting that you’re trying to be spontaneous.” Because, he explains, if you put your mind to the problem directly, you’re activating the part of the brain you need to shut down – the cognitive control areas. The key is relaxation, not striving. Slingerland isn’t suggesting we moderns start doing Confucian rituals, but, he says, “there’s a very similar function served by doing things like weeding the garden, or going for a walk – using your body in a way where you’re interacting with the natural world”. The early Chinese word for the state these activities bring on is wuwei. “I translate it as ‘effortless actions’,” he says. “A state where you lose a sense of yourself as an agent, and you get absorbed in what you’re doing.” Some modern thinkers might equate this sort of state with “flow”, while there are obvious comparisons, too, with mindfulness. “Look at the sunlight on trees and hear birds and you get absorbed in something bigger than yourself,” says Slingerland. “That takes you out of your head and allows you to relax.” This isn’t just about enjoying a good night out. We also need spontaneity to embrace change, says the clinical psychologist and writer Linda Blair. “And change is necessary for progress of any sort. Spontaneity makes us happier, too.” In 2016, a team of Austrian and Italian researchers found that people with less spontaneity in their lives experienced greater “psychological suffering”. The best way forward at the moment, says Blair, “is to turn things on their head and instead of talking about trying to be spontaneous, you say: ‘There is no other way to be right now.’” Now is the time for seizing the day and moving with your heart, or your gut. “You want to go to your favourite restaurant?” asks Blair. “Don’t plan it – go there today, while it’s still open.” She points out that disrupting routines can help to free the mind. This could mean switching off your mental autopilot and thinking about what you really feel like for breakfast today. Another spontaneity starter, she says, is having a backwards day. “That’s a lot of fun, especially with kids. Start your day with dinner, say – anything that shakes up the triggers that keep us doing the same things.” Triggers are things that keep us acting automatically. The cookie jar that makes us think we’re hungry. The phone ping that takes us into a rabbit hole and delays making lunch by 45 minutes. Triggers are not spontaneity’s friends. So Blair’s top tip for starting the day free of our inner naysayers and triggers is to write down all your thoughts first thing in the morning, before you do anything else. This process is called the Morning Pages and was devised by the writer Julia Cameron, originally as part of what she called the Artist’s Way – a method for unblocking creativity. “The best way to be spontaneous,” says Blair, “is to clear out the rubbish that mentally clogs you up every day. You get up in the morning and you write anything, whatever is going through your head, even if it’s: ‘Why am I doing this?’” Cameron prescribes three A4 pages, but if that puts you off, Blair says you’ll still benefit from just writing until you run out, “or for five minutes”. Don’t let time pressures stop you. “One person I know gets up at four o’clock to do it, so that the kids can’t possibly bother her,” says Blair. “It is important to have your own time, and to look at what comes out as potential to do things in a new way.” Not only does this boost your propensity for spontaneity for the rest of the day, says Blair, but it often generates spontaneous ideas. “It suddenly awakens you, so for example, you have a dream that you write down about having seen somebody you realise you haven’t been in touch with for ages. So you now call them or email them.” Joe Oliver is a clinical psychologist who specialises in acceptance and commitment therapy – a mindfulness-based behavioural therapy – and has some good solutions if you’ve lost your spontaneity. So many of his clients have a sense of malaise just now, partly from general pandemic pressures, but also, he says, from “the lack of fun that’s available to them. And fun comes so much from spontaneity – doing things and not thinking too much about it, connecting with people, doing an activity and being allowed to take it in unexpected directions.” One of the barriers, he says, “is people wanting to stay in their comfort zones, where it’s safe, predictable, ordered and people know how things are going to go”. The comfort zone can be useful – especially at the moment, when we need to keep safe, but there’s a danger of talking ourselves out of adventuring. “Overthinking is an absolute classic one,” says Oliver. “Getting entangled with worry about the future: it’s going to be terrible, it’s not going to work out, it won’t be fun, it’s going to have bad consequences, you won’t be safe. And when people get caught up with those thoughts, of course, they do that natural thing of retreating into their comfort zone. Or they ruminate a lot.” Part of the problem is living not in the present, but in the past or the future, thinking: “What about the times it hasn’t worked?” says Oliver. But understanding that this is going on is the first step to recovering spontaneity. He reminds clients: “There’s good evidence that unplanned-for opportunities support wellbeing and mental health.” Next time you catch yourself chickening out of doing something on the spur of the moment, he suggests overruling your critical brain and telling yourself: “I’m doing this because it’s good for me. And I like it. It’s fun. Let’s persist through this initial anxiety and see what comes afterwards.” Mindfulness will help you enjoy the moment you’re in, Oliver says, but “it doesn’t have to be a full-on meditative practice”. Just “anchor into your feet, notice your breath for 10 seconds, roll your shoulders back, drop your arms and spend some time coming down into your body”. Catch those limiting thoughts that tell you we can’t draw/skateboard/jog in the rain, he says, but don’t try to argue with them. If you challenge the thoughts, it creates “a bit of a tussle and can inadvertently give those thoughts a bit more power”. Instead, try thinking: “There are those thoughts again,” or even thank them for their feedback – after all, they’re only trying to keep us safe. Oliver’s other tricks include taking turns with a friend or partner to suggest new things to do, “to build in randomness. I’ve got a favourite pub but my partner often wants to go somewhere else, not in my comfort zone. Sometimes, in the interest of spontaneity, we say to the other: ‘OK, you decide.’ Or sometimes we come up with a couple of pubs and flip a coin.” Because, while your instincts might tell you to stay in your comfort zone, there’s actually no way of foretelling which option will result in the most fun on any given day. “As Daniel Gilbert at Harvard has shown us so well,” says Blair, “we don’t accurately estimate what the future is going to be like. We usually think it’s going to be better than it is. And we don’t accurately estimate what the past was like, either. We are hard on ourselves and overly critical about what happened – or we romanticise it. But now … you can be happy right now.” She says her patients often tell her about a recurring pain that keeps them up at night because it’s so bad. But when she asks them how it is right now, they say: “What, the pain? Oh, it’s not too bad.” Again with the living in the future and the past. “Coming to the now,” says Blair, “things are usually OK.” And here, Austen bears repeating: “Seize the pleasure at once.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘Don’t plan it, just go!’: how to be spontaneous – and grab some unexpected fun",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/11/dont-plan-it-just-go-how-to-be-spontaneous-and-grab-some-unexpected-fun
1/11/2022,"In the final months of Robert Durst’s life, it seemed as if the walls were at last closing in on the disgraced multimillionaire and real estate heir. He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a longtime friend in September, and shortly after, New York officials charged him with the murder of his missing first wife. But his death in a California hospital on Monday has upended the cases against the 78-year-old. The murder case over the death of his ex-wife Kathleen McCormack Durst will come to a halt and, thanks to a legal technicality, the murder conviction for the killing of his friend Susan Berman will soon be voided.  Authorities believe Durst was behind three killings in three states over four decades, as highlighted in the 2015 HBO documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. But despite a jury finding Durst guilty last fall of murdering Berman, a friend and confidante, California law mandates that if a defendant dies while a case is under appeal, as is the situation with Durst’s case, then the conviction is vacated, said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor not involved with the case. “As the law is right now, Durst’s conviction will be vacated and it’s like it never happened,” Rahmani said. “This is such a unique case. It’s really unprecedented that someone can be involved in three different murders in three states and escape justice.” Meanwhile, the case against Durst over his wife’s death can no longer proceed, because officials cannot prosecute a dead man. That means those charges against Durst will have to be dismissed, Rahmani said. “After 40 years spent seeking justice for her death, I know how upsetting this news must be for Kathleen Durst’s family,” the Westchester county district attorney, Mimi Rocah, said in a statement. “We had hoped to allow them the opportunity to see Mr Durst finally face charges for Kathleen’s murder because we know that all families never stop wanting closure, justice and accountability.” Durst was convicted of murdering Berman in September 2020. Prosecutors say he shot her at point-blank range in her home to prevent her from telling police what she knew about McCormack’s disappearance. At the trial Berman, a journalist, was described as an “an extraordinary human being” and loyal friend who cared deeply for others. “It’s a shame when anybody loses their life, however, it’s important to keep in mind that Bob Durst lived to be 78 years old, decades longer than two of his victims,” said John Lewin, the LA county deputy district attorney who prosecuted Durst for Berman’s murder, in a statement. “To the end he was hostile, unrepentant, and unremorseful. My thoughts and sympathies lie with his victims.” At the time of his death, New York prosecutors were preparing to request Durst be transferred to the state to face charges in the death of his ex-wife McCormack, who disappeared in 1982 and whose body was never found. The DA’s office plans to share more information about the McCormack case at a press conference in the coming days, Rocah said. Until last year, Durst, who denied killing McCormack, had never been charged in connection with her disappearance despite multiple efforts to close the case over the decades. Authorities reopened the case in 1999, searching a lake and the couple’s home. McCormack’s family has been critical of officials for not acting sooner. A lawyer for McCormack’s family has said the investigation into the case is ongoing. “Although Robert Durst has died, the ongoing investigation into those who helped him cover up her murder continues. On January 31, 2022, the 40th anniversary of Kathie’s murder, we will provide a further update. In the interim, please say a prayer for Kathie and his other victims,” said Robert Abrams. At the time she disappeared, McCormack was a medical student, who was preparing to become a pediatrician. Her family says Durst was abusive, and that McCormack had previously required treatment in a hospital for injuries he caused. Authorities sought to put Durst behind bars for years for his role in crimes that officials believe date back to the disappearance and probable murder of McCormack. Rocah reopened the case in May, shortly after she took office as the district attorney. But the Westchester county district attorney’s office has long faced criticism for waiting so long to file charges against Durst for McCormack’s killing, Rahmani added. “No one was willing to prosecute and try the case. Unfortunately, because of this long delay Kathie Durst and her family will never receive the criminal justice that she deserves,” Rahmani said. The Jinx, which thrust the multimillionaire into the spotlight, chronicled McCormack’s disappearance, Berman’s murder and the 2001 death of Durst’s neighbor, Morris Black, in Galveston, Texas, where Durst was hiding out while disguised as a deaf-mute woman. He was arrested for Berman’s murder on the eve of the airing of the last episode of the series, in which Durst appeared to confess to the killings, saying to himself, “What the hell did I do? … Killed them all, of course.” Durst avoided a murder conviction for the death of Black, but spent three years in prison for related charges, including evidence tampering for dismembering Black’s body.",News/US news,Robert Durst: how a murderer’s death keeps his victims from finding closure,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/10/robert-durst-murder-conviction-death-victims

1/11/2022,"An inmate gave birth to a stillborn baby in shocking circumstances in a prison toilet without specialist medical assistance or pain relief, an investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman (PPO) has found. A prison nurse who did not respond to three emergency calls from a prison officer to come to the woman’s aid when she developed agonising stomach cramps has been referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council.  Louise Powell, 31, was unaware that she was pregnant and did not believe she could be due to not having relationships with men. She gave birth on a prison toilet on 18 June 2020 at HMP & YOI Styal in Cheshire. She previously said she believed her baby girl could have survived had she had more timely and appropriate medical intervention. Her lawyer said they had obtained expert evidence that also suggested that the baby, who Powell named Brooke, may have survived had things been handled differently. The report is the second by the PPO in six months to investigate the death of a baby in prison. While Tuesday’s report found that there had not been failures before the day Powell gave birth, the ombudsman, Sue McAllister, found there were missed opportunities to establish that she needed urgent clinical attention in the hours beforehand. Powell was in prison for the first time after being sentenced to eight months in March 2020 after admitting common assault, racially aggravated harassment and criminal damage. McAllister said she suffered a “terrifying, painful and traumatic experience” and that “even at a distance this is a deeply sad and distressing case”. “It’s not safe to have pregnant women in prison, we are just treated like a number,” Powell told the Guardian in a previous interview. “I can’t grieve for my baby yet because there are still things I don’t know, like why an ambulance wasn’t called. I want to get justice for Brooke and I decided to go public in the hope that things will change and pregnant women will stop being imprisoned.” The investigation found that a prison supervising officer made three calls to the duty nurse, raising concerns about Powell during a period of two hours from shortly before 7pm on 18 June. The nurse did not come to see Powell, made inadequate reference to her medical file, and concluded incorrectly that she was bleeding and suffering severe stomach pain as a result of a painful period. “Regardless of the cause, it is not acceptable that anyone should be in unexplained acute pain for several hours without proper assessment or consideration of pain relief,” said McAllister. She added that had the situation been assessed properly, Powell might have given birth in hospital instead of on a prison toilet attended by untrained staff. The report found that all the other staff who tried to help Powell and her baby during and after the delivery acted with humanity and to the best of their abilities. The report recommends that women are offered a pregnancy test at the initial and secondary health assessments after arriving at prison. It also recommends that nurses in women’s prisons should have training in recognising early labour, and that all staff in women’s prisons need to know what to do in the event of an unexpected birth. The Prison Service and the NHS have accepted the ombudsman’s recommendations and produced an action plan setting out how they will be implemented. The prisons minister, Victoria Atkins, said: “We have already implemented the report’s recommendations and important improvements have been made to the care received by pregnant women in custody. We are also looking at how we can better screen for pregnancy in jails so no woman falls through the cracks.” Powell’s solicitor, Jane Ryan of Bhatt Murphy, said: “There were multiple missed opportunities to help Louise. There was no system in place to recognise unexpected birth at the time. It is inhumane to leave a woman howling in pain unaided and forced to give birth in a toilet.” Kirsty Kitchen of Birth Companions said: “We cannot go on pretending that the prison system will ever be a safe or appropriate place to give birth.” She called on the government to reinstate its early-release scheme for eligible pregnant women and those in mother and baby units. Janey Starling, co-director of Level Up, who is campaigning for an end to the imprisonment of pregnant women and new mothers, said: “The only way to keep mothers and babies safe in future is to keep them in their communities.”",News/Society,"UK inmate gave birth to stillborn in prison toilets, inquiry finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/11/uk-inmate-gave-birth-to-stillborn-in-prison-toilets-inquiry-finds
1/11/2022,"The House of Lords commissioners for standards are considering a complaint against the Conservative peer Michelle Mone, relating to the PPE business awarded £203m government contracts after she referred it to the Cabinet Office in May 2020. The Labour peer George Foulkes complained to the commissioners on 6 January after the Guardian reported that leaked files appear to suggest Mone and her husband, the Isle of Man-based financier Douglas Barrowman, were secretly involved in the company, PPE Medpro.  After the company was awarded contracts in May and June 2020, Mone and Barrowman have consistently denied any “role or function” in PPE Medpro. Lawyers for Mone, who ran the lingerie company Ultimo before David Cameron made her a peer in 2015, have said she “was not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity”. The fact that Mone referred the company to the office of Theodore Agnew, her fellow Conservative peer who was responsible for procurement during the Covid pandemic, was only disclosed by the government in November 2021 following a freedom of information request pursued by the Good Law Project. Foulkes, a Labour MP from 1979 to 2005 and former Scotland minister in Tony Blair’s government, asked the commissioners to investigate whether Mone may have breached the Lords code of conduct. “I am concerned that Baroness Mone has not registered her interest in PPE Medpro and also that her action appears to bring the house into disrepute,” he wrote. Foulkes told the Guardian: “If Baroness Mone and her husband were involved in the company then it appears to me that she should have registered that as an interest, and she may have breached the rules against lobbying when she referred the company to the government. And with this conduct and her denials in relation to the company, she may have brought the house into disrepute, so I believe the commissioner should investigate.” On Monday, the commissioner confirmed that the complaint was being assessed. “I can confirm that a complaint has been received and the commissioner is currently undertaking an initial assessment of that complaint,” a Lords spokesperson said. “If he decides to open a formal investigation that will be published on the commissioners’ website.” The Conservative MP Kevin Hollinrake also said the commissioners should consider investigating Mone. “The code of conduct is quite clear that peers must not seek to profit from membership of the house, yet the public record shows that Lady Mone made the initial referral through parliamentary channels, and evidence that she pursued and promoted their application, and that there are connections between her, her husband and the company concerned,” Hollinrake said. “The House of Lords commissioner for standards should consider investigating the matter to establish whether any rules have been broken.” Mone’s representatives declined to comment on the complaint. Previously they have said she had no interest in PPE Medpro, and denied any wrongdoing. “The reason why no interest in PPE Medpro appears in Baroness Mone’s register of interests is because no such interest exists,” her lawyer said in December 2020. Barrowman’s lawyers have repeatedly distanced him from PPE Medpro, saying he was not an investor, director or shareholder. They have said the Guardian’s reporting amounted to “clutching at straws” and was “largely incorrect”. Mone’s lawyers have said the Guardian’s reporting is “grounded entirely on supposition and speculation and not based on accuracy”, adding: “She is under no obligation to say anything to you.”",News/Politics,Lords watchdog assesses complaint against Michelle Mone over PPE firm,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/lords-watchdog-assesses-complaint-against-michelle-mone-over-ppe-firm
1/11/2022,"A wealthy Roman trading town, whose inhabitants adorned themselves with jewellery and ate from fine pottery, has been discovered half a metre below the surface of a remote field in Northamptonshire. A 10-metre-wide Roman road, domestic and industrial buildings, more than 300 coins and at least four wells have been unearthed at the site, where 80 archaeologists have been working for the past 12 months.  The field, on the Northamptonshire-Oxfordshire border, lies on the route of the HS2 rail network under construction between London and Birmingham. It is one of more than 100 archaeological sites that have been examined along the route since 2018, and among the most significant findings to date. The site near Chipping Warden, known as Blackgrounds after its dense black soil that has helped preserve the Roman remains, was used for pasture until the archaeological dig began. “When the land became used for grazing, the soil effectively sealed what was beneath,” said James West, of Mola Headland Infrastructure, which has managed the excavation. The presence of an archaeological site in the area has been known since the 18th century, but the findings during the dig surpassed experts’ expectations. “This is certainly one of the most impressive sites [we have] discovered while working on the HS2 scheme,” said West. “Uncovering such a well-preserved and large Roman road, as well as so many high-quality finds, has been extraordinary and tells us so much about the people who lived here. The site really does have the potential to transform our understanding of the Roman landscape in the region and beyond.” An iron age village, formed of more than 30 roundhouses, stood on the site at the time of the Roman invasion in 43BC. During the period of the Roman occupation, which lasted until AD410, the settlement expanded and became more prosperous. New stone buildings were constructed in distinct domestic, agricultural and industrial areas of the settlement. In the latter, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of workshops and kilns, where activities such as metalwork, bread-making and pottery took place. The main road – which West described as “a Roman dual carriageway” – indicates that the town was a trading hub, with carts coming and going to load and unload goods. Most Roman roads were 4-5 metres wide, “so this is really impressive”. The nearby River Cherwell was another trading route to and from the settlement. “At its height, there would have been hundreds of people living in the town. It was a very significant settlement,” said West. The “Romanisation” of the inhabitants included adapting to Roman customs, products and building techniques. Their growing affluence is indicated by the number of Roman coins and scale weights discovered, a sign of considerable commercial activity. One scale weight is decorated with the image of a female deity. “It’s pretty as well as functional, suggesting a high-status owner,” said West. Jewellery with delicate decoration, glass vessels and fine Samian pottery that was imported from Gaul have also been pulled out of the black earth. Evidence of cosmetics has been identified from traces of the mineral galena – lead sulphide – which was crushed and mixed with oil for use as makeup. Half a set of shackles was unearthed, thought to suggest criminal activity or slave labour. More than 1,000 archaeologists have worked along the HS2 route between London and the West Midlands over the past three years. Last October, Roman statues of a man, woman and child were uncovered at an abandoned medieval church on the HS2 route in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire. They were described by the lead archaeologist at the site as “utterly astounding”. At Saint James’s Garden near Euston station in central London, more than 50,000 skeletons were exhumed from a burial ground. In Birmingham, more than 6,500 skeletons were uncovered from an 18th-century cemetery. Mike Court, the lead archaeologist for HS2, said: “As we near the end of our archaeological field work between London and Birmingham, we have made some unprecedented discoveries. “The opportunity to carefully examine a site such as Blackgrounds, and map out a long history of the site, brought to life through artefacts, building remains and roads, has enabled us to provide a more in-depth understanding of what life was like in rural south Northamptonshire in the iron and Roman ages.”",News/Science,Roman town’s remains found below Northamptonshire field on HS2 route,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/11/roman-town-found-northamptonshire-field-hs2-route
1/11/2022,"The pandemic has been awash with slogans, but in recent weeks, two have been repeated with increasing frequency: “Variants will evolve to be milder” and “Covid will become endemic”. Yet experts warn that neither of these things can be taken for granted. Those stating that viruses become less deadly over time often cite influenza. Both of the flu viruses responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu and 2009 swine flu pandemics eventually evolved to become less dangerous. However, the 1918 virus is thought to have become more deadly before it became milder. And other viruses, such as Ebola, have become more dangerous over time.  “It’s a fallacy that viruses or pathogens become milder. If a virus can continue to be transmitted and cause lots of disease, it will,” said Prof David Robertson, head of viral genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research. Viruses aim to create as many copies of themselves and spread as widely as possible. Although it is not always in their best interests to kill their hosts, so long as they are transmitted before this happens, it doesn’t matter. Sars-CoV-2 doesn’t kill people during the period when it is most infectious; people tend to die two to three weeks after becoming ill. Provided it does not evolve to make people so ill that they do not, or cannot, mix with other people while they are infectious, the virus doesn’t care if there are some casualties along the way. Neither is it clear that Sars-CoV-2 is becoming progressively milder. Omicron appears to be less severe than the Alpha or Delta variants – but both of these variants caused more severe illness than the original Wuhan strain. Importantly, viral evolution is not a one-way street: Omicron did not evolve from Delta, and Delta didn’t evolve from Alpha – it is more random and unpredictable than that. “These [variants of concern] are not going one from the other, and so if that pattern continues, and another variant pops out in six months, it could be worse,” said Robertson. “It’s important not to assume that there’s some inevitability for Omicron to be the end of Sars-CoV-2’s evolution.” There is a possibility that Omicron is so transmissible that it has hit a ceiling whereby future variants will struggle to outcompete it. But just a few months ago, people were saying the same thing about Delta. Also, Omicron is likely to keep evolving. “What might play out is that as Omicron infects so many people, it’s harder for that first Omicron [variant] to continue to be as successful, and so that creates a space for a virus that’s better at evading the immune response,” Robertson said. What about the idea that Sars-CoV-2 could become endemic? Politicians tend to use this as a proxy for getting on with our lives and forgetting that Covid-19 exists. What endemic actually means is a disease that’s consistently present, but where rates of infection are predictable and not spiralling out of control “Smallpox was endemic, polio is endemic, Lassa fever is endemic, and malaria is endemic,” said Stephen Griffin, associate professor of virology at the University of Leeds. “Measles and mumps are endemic, but dependent on vaccination. Endemic does not mean that something loses its teeth at all.” As more and more people develop immunity to Sars-CoV-2, or recover from infection, the virus may become less likely to trigger severe disease. But it could then evolve again. The good news is that this becomes less likely the more of the world’s population is vaccinated – because the fewer people who are infected, the fewer chances the virus has to evolve – but we’re not close to that yet. Even in the UK, there are large numbers of unvaccinated individuals, and it’s unclear how long the protection from boosters will last. “The idea that we will achieve endemicity anytime soon also seems a little bit counter to the fact that we’ve just had several weeks of massively explosive exponential growth, and prior to that, we were still seeing exponential growth of Delta,” Griffin said. Transforming Covid into a disease that we can truly live with requires more than a national vaccination campaign and wishful thinking; it requires a global effort to improve surveillance for new variants, and supporting countries to tackle outbreaks at source when they emerge. It also requires greater investment in air purification and ventilation to reduce transmission within our own borders, if we’re mixing indoors. Everyone hopes that the coronavirus will evolve to become milder, and that Covid becomes endemic – or rather, manageable enough not to blight our daily lives. But these are hopes, not facts, and repeating these mantras won’t make them happen any faster.",News/World news,Will Covid-19 become less dangerous as it evolves? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/11/will-covid-19-become-less-dangerous-as-it-evolves
1/11/2022,"When it comes to predicting flooding, it isn’t just the amount of rain that matters, but also where the excess rain can be stored – if the earth is already saturated the rain has nowhere to go, and flooding follows on. Scientists are now taking advantage of the fact that saturated earth has a greater gravitational pull, and that satellites can monitor the changes in saturation from day to day. Prof Shin-Chan Han, from the University of Newcastle in Australia, and colleagues measure changes in the Earth’s gravity by monitoring micrometre changes in distance between the two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellites.  When the satellites approach an area with higher gravitational pull (such as a saturated groundwater reservoir) the lead satellite is tugged forward, increasing the gap between the satellites. Shortly afterwards the tail satellite is also pulled forward, shortening the distance between the satellites. By regularly measuring the change in distance between the satellites Han and his colleagues were able to demonstrate that the devastating floods experienced in eastern Australia in March 2021 were preceded by a rapid recharge of groundwater the week before the rains. Their findings, published in Earth and Space Science, have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to prepare for floods.",News/News,How satellites can dramatically improve ability to prepare for flooding,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/11/how-satellites-can-dramatically-improve-ability-to-prepare-for-flooding
1/11/2022,"“Levelling up” was always a slippery slogan. If the civil war was Boris Johnson’s period of history, he might have shunned its potential association with the Levellers and the Diggers, who dug up the fences of enclosures for the landless to plough and sow. Their most famous digging, in the year of Charles I’s execution, was St George’s Hill in Weybridge, Surrey, now in a gated and guarded enclosure including a grand golf club where nearby house prices reach £5m. Stand there and ponder what levelling up can possibly mean to Surrey Tories and their MPs.  It was a bold slogan to announce, in the context of a skyrocketing stock market and soaring UK house prices, which rose by 9.8% last year, the fastest rate since 2007. Meanwhile, workers were furloughed and food banks hard-pressed. This is the first postwar recession with rising property values, says the Resolution Foundation. This year, on 7 January, FTSE 100 chief executives had already earned more than the median pay for all full-time workers in the UK, according to The High Pay Centre. The latest ONS wealth figures show that the gap between rich and poor in the UK has now grown to its widest in a decade. It has “steadily increased to 36.3%” according to the ONS, which measures inequality by the Gini coefficient, whereby 0% represents total equality and 100% represents total inequality. This is awkward for Johnson the Leveller: until now Tories could claim inequality had become no worse under their government. But here is the history: the much-maligned 1970s were the most equal time on record; in the 1980s, there was a meteoric rise in top pay and wealth soared, while the lowest salaries fell behind. That great gap never narrowed again. The richest 10% of the population now own 43% of wealth, leaving the entire bottom half just 9%. What was Leveller Johnson’s reaction to official figures revealing wealth gaps widening between north and south, old and young, white and other ethnicities? At PMQs last week he wrongly claimed that “inequality is down in this country”. He wants “levelling up” to be purely geographic to seduce red wallers, but he should be warned: the south-east’s median household wealth rose by 43% in 16 years, while it fell in the north-east. Whatever trinkets Michael Gove crafts to decorate his levelling up white paper this month, he and Johnson are unlikely to admit the mammoth endeavour it would take to shift the dial even slightly. Sunak has set aside just £4.8bn for the levelling-up agenda, which is a teaspoon to shift a slag heap. About £2tn was spent to level up East and West Germany – and they are still only 85% of the way there. Johnson’s cabinet is in undisciplined revolt. Jacob Rees-Mogg let it be known he led a protest against the national insurance rise and called for a cut in the civil service pay bill instead: “cut the bureaucrats” is the last refuge of dishonest politicians. Senior Tories call for the pensions triple lock to be restored. Behind them thundering hooves gallop after axing VAT and green taxes on energy bills. Insurrectionist Mark Harper, a former chief whip, says he will declare a leadership challenge if May’s local election results are bad. David Frost, the Brexit bruiser, brays for “free markets and low taxes”. The government is reportedly panicking at a “chicken run” of red wall Tory MPs defecting to Labour, for fear of losing their seats where Labour polls 16% ahead, a comically unlikely route to securing tax or green policy cuts those MPs want. The Tories are right to quake as the May elections near, when April really will be the cruellest month as households face the crunch of £1,200 in extra bills as council tax rises and 5 million social housing tenants face the highest rent rises in a decade. Meanwhile, wages and benefits fall behind. The hard truth is that there never was and never could be a Tory “levelling up”. There are good ways to ease the cost of living crisis, but none are Conservative ways. Any levelling must start with restoring the £20 a week removed from universal credit, but that’s unTory. Johnson’s government could impose a windfall tax on the six companies that made £16bn excess profits out of the pandemic, says Tax Justice UK. It could tax the excessive gains made by the bizarre increase in property values, says the Resolution Foundation. This weekend, the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, advocate of wealth taxes, laid out Labour’s plan to cut £200 from all energy bills and £600 from those of the neediest households, paid for with a windfall on North Sea oil and gas profits. The BP CEO, Bernard Looney, unwisely said energy price rises had turned his company into a “cash machine”, while the North Sea company Serica promises its shareholders bumper returns. A revaluation of council tax to create a “proportional property tax” would help 75% of households, reports Fairer Share. Sunak could revive his dropped plan to lift capital gains tax from 20% to 25%, which would have brought in a handsome £14bn. These would be popular ways that could pay for stricken public services, but they aren’t Tory ways. The public never voted for this hard Brexit, this graveyard of trade deals with its colossal loss of 4% in GDP, depriving the Treasury of precious receipts. But the nature of this Tory cult decreed it. “There’s no point in saying you’re Conservative,” protests a senior Tory to PoliticsHome, “unless you cut taxes.” The axe is the emblem of this cultish Tory generation.

1/11/2022,"London could become mired in gridlock because of a shift towards driving as a means of transport during the Covid pandemic, the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan has said, warning that it risks creating a new health crisis from increased pollution. While levels of walking and cycling have risen in the capital, the overall proportion of people making sustainable journeys has fallen as a result of the collapse in numbers using public transport.  Almost two years since the first lockdown, use of the tube is at 55% of pre-pandemic levels, and bus use is at 70%. In contrast, car use returned to close-to-normal levels during much of the second half of 2021. A comparison of all transport modes in London during 2020 showed that the proportion of journeys made by walking, cycling and public transport fell to an estimated 58.3%, as against 63.2% in 2019. This was despite a 9% increase in walking and cycling during 2020, with additional cycle routes and walking space provided. The number of miles being driven in the capital has increased markedly in recent years, despite statistics showing that more than a third of car trips in London could be made in under 25 minutes by walking, and that two-thirds could be cycled in less than 20 minutes. Between 2011 and 2019, the overall number of miles driven on London’s roads increased from 19.1bn to 22.6bn miles. In 2020 this fell only slightly, to 18.7bn miles, despite lockdowns. Khan said: “Whilst we have made huge strides in increasing walking and cycling in London throughout the pandemic, car use has remained consistently high. If we do not double down on our efforts to deliver a greener, more sustainable future we will replace one public health crisis with another – caused by filthy air and gridlocked roads. “The cost to both Londoners and the capital cannot be underestimated, with days wasted stuck in traffic, billions lost to the economy, and increased road danger and health impacts. Most traffic is caused simply by there being too great a demand for limited street space, meaning the only long-term solution can be to significantly reduce car use in favour of greener means of travel.” The expanded ultra-low emission zone has led to about 47,000 fewer older, more polluting vehicles driving within the capital’s north and circular roads – a 37% reduction from the two weeks before the scheme was introduced, the mayor’s office said. As part of measures to reduce congestion, Khan also said penalties for traffic offences on roads it manages would rise from £130 to £160 from Monday. Transport for London will also benefit slightly from the increased revenue, with the capital’s finances under severe strain as a result of people making fewer tube journeys. It netted about £18m from penalty charge notices in 2018, suggesting the rise could increase annual income by about £4m. Khan has overseen the construction of a series of new cycling and walking schemes, and has consistently pushed for a greater focus on active travel.

With active infections of Covid-19 across the country exceeding 1 million, Ambulance Victoria issued a code red alert on Tuesday – the second time it has taken the extreme measure in a week – as it grapples with “extremely high demand for ambulances” in metropolitan Melbourne.  “It is likely there will be a delay in an ambulance reaching you,” Ambulance Victoria said in a statement, also urging residents to contact other medical supports or visit their local GP “if their illness is not an emergency”. “Our priority is to provide care to Victorians who require life-saving assistance,” the statement said. Acknowledging the shortfall of paramedics in his state, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said that on Monday 442 ambulance staff were either isolating with Covid-19 or were close contacts. “I expect that number is in fact higher, and that does put great pressure on our system,” he said. “It’s not a matter of money or a matter of machines … it’s qualified staff, it’s people who provide healthcare.” Victoria’s code red declaration follows reports in recent days that surf lifesavers, students and volunteers were filling hundreds of paramedic shifts each week in the state. In New South Wales, ambulance services are also under severe strain. On Tuesday, NSW Ambulance apologised to a Sydney couple who said there were no ambulances immediately available to help their newborn baby who was not breathing. After the mother – who works as a midwife – gave birth unexpectedly in their Sydney home on the morning of 2 January, they realised their newborn son was not breathing. The couple said the ambulance service could not tell them how long it would be before an ambulance arrived, so they decided to drive to hospital instead, resuscitating the newborn on the way. The child entered neonatal intensive care and has since recovered. Guardian Australia understands it is common protocol for ambulance call centre operators to avoid offering callers an arrival time, however the organisation has said it is investigating “the circumstances surrounding this incident and a review is underway”. A NSW Ambulance spokesman told Guardian Australia that the seven-day rolling average for triple zero callouts is nearly 4,500 each day. He said that prior to the Omicron outbreak, daily call volume records had not exceeded 4,000. “The service is currently facing unprecedented demand,” he said. “​​All available operational staff have been surged.” In ambulance control centres, “50 extra call takers have been surged”, he said. “NSW Ambulance also recalled 11 emergency medical call takers who were sent to Victoria to assist in control centres there. “Our virtual clinical care centre has also been bolstered with 22 clinical support assistants commencing duties facilitating call backs to patients experiencing longer than usual delays. More staff will come on board this month.” NSW Ambulance experienced an all time peak in demand 1 January, when 5,120 triple zero calls were received, and the service has been urging residents to only call in emergencies.",News/Australia news,Ambulance Victoria issues code red alert and NSW under ‘unprecedented’ pressure from Omicron wave,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/ambulance-victoria-issues-code-red-alert-and-nsw-under-unprecedented-pressure-from-omicron-wave
1/11/2022,"Staff shortages during the current Omicron case surge are proving more disruptive than during the height of the Delta wave, Australia’s businesses warn as they plead for greater access to rapid antigen tests and a unified message from governments. An unofficial lockdown in Sydney and Melbourne has also hammered consumer confidence and spending as people stay at home rather than risk catching the virus.  “This is an imperfect storm,” Damian Kelly, a spokesman for Business NSW, said. “At a time when businesses were hoping for a bumper summer, it’s been the reverse.” The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said the situation was worse than in early to mid-2020 when Covid first hit and lockdowns began. “Back then we did have supply chain issues, but nowhere near, and the reason is because of the number of people who are sick,” she said. “Never in our history have we had the hole in this number of workers at the same time sick – it’s a big, big crisis economically and obviously personally for everyone affected.” McManus wrote to Scott Morrison on Monday urging the prime minister to make rapid antigen tests free for all, extend paid pandemic leave that is currently limited to household contacts to all close contacts, upgrade work mask requirements and increase support payments to workers and businesses reeling from the burgeoning economic crisis. Requirements for workers to isolate amid a widespread surge in new Covid cases and the lack of available testing are forcing companies large and small to limit operations, while the latest consumer confidence data points to a chilling effect of the turmoil on consumer spending. Virgin Australia reportedly cut its January and February schedule by a quarter while Qantas has so far dodged any major impact other than cancelling some of its Jetstar flights during the first couple of weeks in January with the bulk of passengers rapidly reassigned seats. Inghams, Australia’s biggest chicken supplier, said staff shortages caused by the Omicron wave were causing shortages at customers that Guardian Australia has confirmed include KFC, which is having difficulty obtaining some types of fresh chicken pieces on the east coast. Visits to supermarkets reveal meat and some dairy products to be among the most affected if emptying shelves are any guide. Most dairy farms, for instance, can hold only about one or two days’ supply of milk, and have to dispose of the product if they can’t get it out the farm gate, the industry said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Alexi Boyd, the chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, said the shortage of workers was savaging the hospitality and retail sectors, including activities ranging from hair salons to live music and other entertainment events. Conditions were now akin to the depths of the Delta lockdowns in NSW and Victoria last year but without the same aid from governments. “The key differences, they were state-sanctioned and there was small business support in place or regardless of what the reason was,” Boyd said. “Now many of those support measures no longer exist but we’re essentially in a similar situation in that business cannot function for no fault of their own.” Boyd said the lack of rapid antigen tests and their costs was only one of the issues that governments should hurry up and fix. Another was a plea to the Morrison government to remove limitations on international students that still keep them from working more than 20 hours a week. “It should be lifted to up to 40 hours a week across the board,” she said. Also unlike during the Delta wave, communications from governments about what people in business should be doing has broken down. “There’s a disconnect between the information that’s been given broadly to the community and then how do small business distil that into what’s applicable and practical for their business,” Boyd said. “We’ve lost that.” McManus said that during previous waves “there was a sense that we’re all in this together”, but the failure of the Morrison government to plan for the reopening of the economy had destroyed this. “I believe that people feel as though we’re rudderless, like we’ve been left to fend for ourselves,” she said. “The level of incompetence and negligence is astounding.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app She said jobseeker payments should be lifted back to the level it was in 2020 when the government paid a $550 a fortnight pandemic supplement and jobkeeper-style payments reintroduced, but with broader coverage that included casuals and visa workers. “It’s not as if we know that next week it’s getting better,” she said. “It’s not, it’s going to get worse and it’s going to get worse for weeks and that’s people once again left with nothing.” ANZ and Roy Morgan released their latest Australian Consumer Confidence survey on Tuesday, which indicated spenders’ optimism was down 2.2% compared to the final assessment last year taken a week before Christmas. The main drop came for “current economic conditions”, which fell 8.7% to its lowest level since the last week of September 2021 when the Delta lockdown ensnared about half of Australia’s population. “Future economic conditions”, though, gained 2.8%. David Plank, ANZ’s head of Australian economics, said the drop in sentiment was likely caused by the rapid rise of Omicron cases across Australia. Confidence fell in all the major capitals, with Adelaide faring the worst. “Over the decade from 2011 to 2020, consumer confidence has risen 2.6% on average in the first survey of January compared to the last prior to Christmas, Plank said. “So this result is even weaker than it seems. “The good news is that people are still relatively happy about their own financial circumstances,” Plank said. “This potentially sets things up for a rapid rebound once people are more confident about health outcomes.” Among those tracking consumer – and therefore, voter – confidence closely are federal politicians with an election due by 21 May. Jim Chalmers, Labor’s shadow treasurer, said: “Just a few weeks ago, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg were talking about the ‘real momentum’ of the recovery but those gains have yet again been squandered. “The scale of this stuff-up is so big, and the consequences for ordinary Australians so bad, that all options should be up for discussion – but Scott Morrison always goes missing when workers and small businesses need him most,” Chalmers said. The treasurer, Frydenberg, was approached for comment.",News/Australia news,‘It’s a big crisis’: Covid staff shortages more disruptive now than at height of Delta,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/11/its-a-big-crisis-covid-staff-shortages-more-disruptive-now-than-at-height-of-delta
1/11/2022,"As the grey sky darkens, waves of black, silhouetted fieldfares and starlings move through the air, some dropping to settle on the grass on the brooks. A lapwing loops in a figure of eight and lands among others huddling together beside one of the pools. The calls of Canada geese and whistles of teals and wigeons carry over the quietening marsh. I scan the fields with my telescope, watching the birds begin to settle down for the night.  I pick up an upright shape sitting on a pile of mud. Refocusing, I see that it’s a female merlin. The small, brown bird of prey sits with its back to me, the cold wind picking at its feathers. It turns its head from side to side, watching the flocks of birds coming in to roost. It bends down and pulls at something at its feet. I’d seen a female merlin earlier in the afternoon – a dark arrowhead shape chasing the starlings across the brooks – and this is probably the same bird, feeding on a kill. It finishes its meal, stretches out its wings, shakes its head and begins to clean its talons with its beak. Our smallest birds of prey, merlins breed on northern uplands, but some come south for the winter. They can be hard to see on Sussex grasslands, the Downs or coastal marshes – and then only fleetingly as they briefly alight on a post, or dart low in pursuit of small birds – so I’m determined to watch this one as long as I can. The merlin preens, carefully running its beak through its wing feathers, pushing them back into place. It turns its head almost all the way round and stares directly at me. I remain completely still. It watches me for a while and then turns back. As the day becomes darker, the definition of the bird fades, its brown plumage merging with the muddy background. I’m about to move on when the merlin leans forward and stretches its wings again. It flaps once, twice. This time it pushes off, and I watch it fly away, across the marsh and towards the trees, where I lose sight of it in the gloom.
