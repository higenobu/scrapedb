4/28/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin ominously warned on Wednesday that if any other country intervenes in Ukraine, Russia will respond with “instruments… nobody else can boast of, and we will use them if we have to.” In recent days, Russian state media has been hyping up the same rhetoric, bombarding audiences with jarring declarations that World War III is imminent. Every major channel is promoting the idea of an inevitable, never-before-seen escalation over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is being portrayed as a war waged against the Kremlin by the collective West. Patriotic citizens are now being primed for the idea that even the worst outcome is a good thing, because those dying for the motherland will skyrocket to paradise. During Tuesday’s broadcast of 60 Minutes, Vladimir Avatkov of Russia’s Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered an Orwellian perspective of current events. “What is happening right now is not about Ukraine, but about the future world order, which has no room for hegemony and where Russia can’t be isolated.” Host Olga Skabeeva described a summit hosted by the U.S. in Germany that day to discuss upping Ukraine’s defense capabilities as a sign that this is indeed “World War III, no longer just a special operation, with forty countries against us. They declared a war.” Portraying global opponents of Russian aggression as evil incarnate, political scientist Mikhail Markelov claimed: “The representatives of those forty different countries are today’s collective Hitler.” Later the same day, on The Evening With Vladimir Solovyov, host Vladimir Solovyov lamented the West’s refusal to heed the Kremlin’s warnings. “If they decide to support Ukraine—even though [Russia’s Foreign Minister] Sergey Lavrov told them that this could lead to WWIII—nothing will stop them. They’ve decided to play it big... These are the bastards with no morals.” Head of RT Margarita Simonyan added: “Personally, I think that the most realistic way is the way of World War III, based on knowing us and our leader, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, knowing how everything works around here, it’s impossible—there is no chance—that we will give up.” In perhaps the most shocking declaration about a nuclear holocaust delivered on Russian television in recent months, Simonyan concluded that the idea “that everything will end with a nuclear strike, to me, is more probable than the other outcome. This is to my horror, on one hand, but on the other hand, with the understanding that it is what it is.” Solovyov chimed in: “But we will go to heaven, while they will simply croak.” Simonyan comforted the audiences by adding: “We’re all going to die someday.” Once the conversation turned to Western arms deliveries to Ukraine and a series of fires and explosions on Russian territory, Solovyov pondered out loud: “What is preventing us from striking the territory of the United Kingdom, targeting those logistical centers where these arms are being loaded?” Andrey Sidorov, deputy dean of world politics at Moscow State University, retorted that rather than strike the U.K., Russia should target the real mastermind: America. He specified: “If we decide to strike the U.K., we should rather decide to strike the United States... Final decisions are being made not in London, but in Washington. If we want to hit the real center of the West, then we need to strike Washington.” Attacks Begin in New Country as Russia Warns Nuclear Threat Is ‘Real’ In a bizarre attempt to soften the blow of Russia’s grim predicament, state TV host and media personality Dmitry Kulikov told audiences that war is sometimes “inevitable.” “This is a big war. The West declared it against us. It’s being waged through different methods, never seen before, but there’s never been as many nuclear weapons in the world either,” he said. “That is the only thing that sets this war apart from all others. This is a historical event, something we’re used to. Let’s be worthy of our predecessors, everyone who lived through that. What made us think that our lives should be better than those of our grandparents? Why should we be free of our historical mission?” Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova appeared on the same program and continued with the same hard line. Solovyov asked her: “How far is the West ready to go?” Without hesitation, Zakharova replied: “They’ll go as far as they’re allowed to. If they aren’t stopped, they will go all the way.” Adding his two cents to the nuclear apocalypse sideshow on Wednesday was military expert and retired Colonel Yury Knutov. “I’ve been observing the American approach from its top levels of leadership towards Russia for several years now,” he said on the state TV show 60 Minutes. “For some reason, they believe that Russia can be choked for as long as it takes, until it surrenders, and Russia will never respond or use its nuclear weapons or its nuclear potential... They themselves are creating the situation when there is a threat to the existence of our nation and our military doctrine prescribes that it gives us the right to use nuclear weapons.” Throughout the program, close-up photographs depicting dead Ukrainian servicemen were repeatedly shown on the screen. Knutov praised the production choice. “We see the Ukrainian land flooded by corpses of Ukrainian soldiers and National Guardsmen... our media needs to be showing more of that.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/28/2022,"Boeing’s CEO is lamenting the deal that his company cut with former President Donald Trump to produce new Air Force One jets. David Calhoun said “it was a public negotiation” and “we took some risks” in accepting a fixed-price contract that made Boeing responsible if it cost more than expected to convert two Boeing 747 jumbo jets into presidential planes. “Air Force One I’m just going to call a very unique moment, a very unique negotiation, a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably should not have taken,” Calhoun said Wednesday, “but we are where we are, and we’re going to deliver great airplanes.” Calhoun commented on the planes when an analyst asked him about the matter during a call to discuss Boeing’s first-quarter earnings results. The company lost $1.2 billion and took a $660 million write-down for Air Force One. Calhoun was on the board but he was not CEO when Boeing agreed to the $3.9 billion deal with the White House in 2018, and when it took a fixed-cost contract to build a new military training jet, which Boeing just wrote down by $367 million. “Yes, they were written off the day we took them, knowing that we would be investing a fair amount of our own money” in the planes, Calhoun said. Back in 2018, Boeing tweeted that it was “proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers.” The Trump White House said the deal would save taxpayers more than $1.4 billion. The jets are being outfitted with advanced communications equipment, work spaces, sleeping areas and other features that make it a flying office for the president. The work is taking place in San Antonio, Texas. Boeing sued a subcontractor that it blamed for delays last year. On Wednesday, Boeing officials said the pandemic and supply-chain issues have also slowed the work. It's unclear what the planes will look like. Trump took a keen interest in the planes and even promoted his own paint job which is still displayed on Boeing's website. However, many purists have called for keeping the current livery, which dates to the time of President John F. Kennedy. Air Force officials said last fall that no decision had been made. Boeing promised to deliver the planes by December 2024 under a contract negotiated by then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired in late 2019 in the fallout from two deadly crashes of Boeing 737 Max jets. Calhoun said he doesn’t want any more fixed-price contracts.",Business/Associated Press,Boeing CEO laments deal with Trump for Air Force One planes,https://news.yahoo.com/boeing-ceo-laments-deal-trump-183927650.html
4/28/2022,"House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy received a standing ovation from House Republicans during a meeting on Wednesday after he addressed leaked audio from a phone call he made days after the January 6 Capitol riot. “Standing ovation and Kevin will be speaker,” Representative Nancy Mace (R., S.C.) told reporters after the meeting on Wednesday, according to Fox News. Representative Jay Obernolte (R., Calif.) confirmed to Fox News that the members gave McCarthy a standing ovation. The New York Times recently published audio from a January 10, 2021 meeting of Republican leadership in which McCarthy expressed concern that Representative Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) and Representative Mo Brooks (R., Ala.) were endangering the security of other lawmakers and the Capitol complex in the wake of January 6. Leadership discussed several other GOP lawmakers during the January 10 call who made comments they deemed offensive or dangerous as well, including Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Barry Moore of Alabama. It was during that phone call with Republican leaders — including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who is the No. 2 House Republican, then-House Republican Conference chairwoman Liz Cheney, and Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota — that McCarthy suggested he would call on Trump to resign, as the New York Times first reported last week. “He addressed them and I think the conference is satisfied,” Obernolte told Fox News of what the House GOP leader said about the leaked comments. Representative Robert Aderholt (R., Ala.) told The Hill that McCarthy said that the conversations featured in the leaked audio were the leaders just speculating on different scenarios, including suggesting Trump resign and wondering if GOP members could be kicked off of social media. “He just said that we were going to lay out different things of what could be,” Aderholt said. “At this point, you know, I take his word for it.” The meeting included a discussion around the need for Republicans to remain focused on taking back control of the House in the upcoming midterms, according to The Hill. “This is a distraction, folks. Come on. This is simply a distraction by the left trying to drive a wedge in a very unified Republican Party and a very unified conference,” said Representative Barry Loudermilk of Georgia. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told The Hill that she spoke during the meeting on Wednesday and wanted to see McCarthy and Scalise apologize for their comments in the leaked audio about Gaetz. “We all need to be accountable for our words. I’ve had to do that before. And that we need to apologize when we say something wrong,” Greene said, adding that it was “hurtful” to hearing McCarthy suggest that members be removed from social media. However, she noted McCarthy’s team has helped her with her effort to restore her personal Twitter account, which was permanently suspended.  “A lot of this stuff is just drama that the American people don’t care about,” Greene said.  In audio from January 2021 published by the New York Times on Tuesday, McCarthy said the country was “too crazy” for the lawmakers to speak or tweet recklessly in the wake of the riots. “He’s putting people in jeopardy,” McCarthy said of Gaetz after the Florida Republican appeared on television attacking several Republicans who had criticized Trump. “And he doesn’t need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else.” Meanwhile, Cheney is heard in audio from the same meeting asking McCarthy if there is any chance Trump would resign. “My gut tells me no,” McCarthy responded, according to the audio released by the New York Times last week. “I am seriously thinking about having that conversation with him tonight.” “The only discussion I would have with him is I think this will pass, and it would be my recommendation that he should resign,” McCarthy says, referring to the impeachment resolution in the House. “That would be my take, but I don’t think he would take it. But I don’t know.” Before the audio’s release last week, McCarthy issued a statement disputing reporting on the meeting by New York Times reporters Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin. “The New York Times reporting on me is totally false and wrong. It comes as no surprise that the corporate media is obsessed with doing everything it can to further a liberal agenda,” McCarthy said. “This promotional book tour is no different. If the reporters were interested in truth why would they ask for comment after the book was printed?” McCarthy Rejects January 6 Committee’s Request for Voluntary Testimony McCarthy Knocks Cheney and Kinzinger: ‘Pelosi Republicans’ Rep.
