4/26/2022,"The four people stabbed to death in a house in south-east London have been formally identified by police. Denton Burke, 58, and his partner, NHS worker Dolet Hill, 64, were both killed at their home in Delaford Road, Bermondsey, on Monday. Hill’s daughter, Tanysha Ofori-Akuffo45, also known as Rachquel, who lived in Kennington, and Ofori-Akuffo’s daughter, Samantha Drummonds, 27, who lived in Forest Hill, also died. A 28-year-old man discovered at the scene was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. He is currently being treated in hospital, and is in a stable condition. Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS foundation trust paid tribute to Dolet Hill, who was an active trade union member. Alastair Gourlay, director of estates and facilities, said: “We are devastated to hear about the tragic death of Dolet Hill, who worked as a housekeeping assistant in our pharmacy department for more than 21 years, before her retirement in 2018. “Dolet was a well-respected colleague, who also helped to improve the workplace for others as an active Unison representative. “Our thoughts are with Dolet’s family, friends and all who worked with her.” DC I Linda Bradley, who is leading the investigation into the deaths, warned that it would be “a protracted inquiry”. “This was a truly horrific incident and I fully recognise that the distress for the family and the community will be overwhelming.” Bradley said the police were moving “as fast as we can at the scene”, but added it would take time to uncover all the facts and secure necessary evidence. “We are conducting a thorough and detailed investigation into the facts and we are appealing to anyone who can assist with any information to come forward,” said Bradley. “We are aware that we have family, friends and a community that are all asking questions; we are determined to give them the answers they deserve as soon as possible.” Neighbours on Monday expressed their disbelief at what they believe is an isolated incident. Danny Smith, 39, an acquaintance of the household and local resident for 20 years, first heard screaming at 1am. Describing the individuals as “such a nice family”, Smith said while he’s heard occasional police raids, he had never heard of an incident on this scale in the area. “It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened here,” said Smith, who saw police officers arrive in the early hours of the morning. “It’s not the nicest neighbourhood, but everybody knows each other.” Another neighbour who heard screams on Monday morning and asked not to be named, described the incident as “a very barbaric act” and said it was “tragic”. Anne Birkett, 60, was woken by police sirens and helicopter circling overhead before 2am. “It’s devastating – you hear all of this but you never assume it’s going to be right on your own doorstep,” said Birkett, a foster carer who lives nearby.",News/UK news,Met police name the four people killed in Bermondsey stabbings ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/met-police-name-the-four-people-killed-in-bermondsey-stabbings
4/26/2022,"Detectives have launched a hate crime investigation after a blue plaque commemorating David Oluwale, a British-Nigerian man who died in 1969 after being harassed by police, was stolen within hours after being unveiled on Leeds Bridge. An event to mark the installation of the plaque, attended by the leader of Leeds city council, was held between 5pm and 7pm on Monday and by 10pm it had been taken. The theft followed racist graffiti being daubed on the office of Leeds Civic Trust – which installs blue plaques in the city – on Sunday night. The site of the plaque was chosen because it was close to where Oluwale was last seen alive, being chased by Sgt Kenneth Kitching and Insp Geoffrey Ellerker. His body was found two weeks later about a mile away in the River Aire, which flows under the bridge. Kitching, who described Oluwale as “a wild animal, not a human being”, and Ellerker were later convicted of assault by a jury, in the first successful prosecution of British police officers for involvement in the death of a black person. In a joint statement, the Remember Oluwale trust, which had campaigned for and raised funds for the plaque, and Leeds Civic Trust, described the theft as “shocking”. They said: “These are cowardly acts from people who are unwilling to debate their views in public. “The successful unveiling of the plaque shows how far we have come as a city to combat racism. Its theft shows how much more we need to do.” The trust’s director, Martin Hamilton, said the plaque would be replaced if the original was not recovered. West Yorkshire police believe the plaque was stolen some time between 9.30pm and 10pm on Monday. The force appealed for anyone with any information about the theft to contact Leeds district CID. Ch Supt Damien Miller, Leeds district commander, said: “It is truly appallingly that someone would remove the plaque commemorating the life of David Oluwale, and we recognise the significant impact that this act will have had on all those involved in keeping David’s memory alive and on the wider community. “The timing clearly suggests that this has been a deliberately targeted act and we are classing this as a hate crime. “We are treating this incident very seriously and have detectives from Leeds district CID carrying out extensive enquiries to identify who is responsible and to locate and recover the plaque.”",News/World news,David Oluwale: blue plaque for victim of police racism stolen hours after unveiling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/26/david-oluwale-blue-plaque-for-victim-of-police-racism-stolen-hours-after-unveiling
4/26/2022,"Describing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) as a “lifestyle drug” is ignorant, ill-informed and hugely depressing for all women who rely on it. But that is how some have responded to the current crisis in supply, suggesting women like me who use HRT should “just get on with it”. Britain is currently experiencing acute shortages of these drugs, which boost levels of hormones such as oestrogen as women get older and approach the menopause. HRT helps to alleviate the debilitating symptoms associated with menopause, including hot flushes and night sweats. This is why it is so important for women to be able to tell their story and call attention to the life-changing difference HRT has made for them. The treatment has allowed many women to continue working, carry out their caring responsibilities, live life normally and escape the crippling anxiety that menopause can bring. But the continuing problems with HRT supply, particularly the oestrogen gel that many women use, has left many desperate, swapping products or turning to the internet to get supplies. In response, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, recently announced he would be appointing an “HRT tsar” to address these shortages, emulating the position of Kate Bingham, the Covid vaccine chief. This is a welcome step – but the new appointee needs to crack on to solve the problems with supply immediately. I have no doubt they will have met manufacturers, but the issues we’re now seeing are neither new nor unexpected. Even before the pandemic I was hearing from my constituents about inconsistencies in the supply of some forms of HRT. This left women having to chop and change prescriptions, trying to find what was still available. In the past few months this situation has become worse. Demand now way outstrips supply. A clandestine market has emerged, where women are trying to get hold of the life-changing drug. I am as guilty as anyone; I surreptitiously borrowed some from my colleague Carolyn Harris, whose private member’s bill last year called for greater menopause support, and gave us all hope and expectation. So what do I want to see from the new tsar? Getting on with the job tomorrow would be a good start. Maria Caulfield, the MP for Lewes, told us that the supply of the main oestrogen gel used by many had doubled in the past year, but my local menopause nurse said the number of patients she had seen over the past 18 months had risen tenfold. It’s easy to see how demand has far outstripped supply. The government needs to resolve this market failure. Women now have the confidence to ask their GPs for HRT. This is cause for celebration. I’m thrilled to be part of the group of amazing and determined women behind the Menopause Mandate, which seeks to empower women to tell their stories and be part of a menopause revolution. But if we can’t access our HRT, we all know we are not going to be able to function normally. About 80% of women experience menopausal symptoms that would be alleviated by HRT. The prospect of millions of us mobilising should concern any government. So far, the response has lacked urgency and been marked by unacceptable delays in the promised changes to prescription charges. In April 2023, a single, annual prepayment of £18.70 for HRT prescriptions will be introduced – but this policy was first announced in October last year. Ministers need to sort out this delay quickly. Our coalition of menopause campaigners won’t go away quietly, so the new tsar had better be as determined as we are.

4/26/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to three. During an interview with Seth Meyers two years ago, in his first ever appearance on late night TV, Michael Mando was asked how he dealt with snakes in his role as Ignacio “Nacho” Varga. Mando hates snakes and the New Mexico desert is full of them, so the second thing he did whenever he got a Better Call Saul script was look out for reptiles. “The first thing I look at with the script is,” Mando said, “am I dead?” Nacho’s end has felt imminent since the very start of this drama. He’s the Salamanca cohort who was not part of the family, either by blood or by constitution. The guy with half a conscience in a town full of monsters. Always exposed, and with his own axes to grind, he never truly felt long for this world. And with 10 hours of Better Call Saul remaining, he has returned to the dust. To some extent, he did so on his own terms. Having taken on the role of inside man in Gus Fring’s plan to assassinate Lalo Salamanca, Nacho was quickly fingered by everyone as being key to the plot. The cartel wanted him, the Salamancas, too, and Nacho was forced to hide in a puddle of oil to escape them. But after contacting Gus and extracting a guarantee of safety for his father from Mike Ehrmantraut, Nacho was smuggled north of the border in the bottom of a truck and briefed on how to make his final confession. The line was that the assassination attempt was a Peruvian plot, but there was no doubt among anyone involved in confecting the story that Nacho would end up dead after telling it. Mike offered him the possibility of a swift bullet to the head, better that than the more drawn-out attentions of the Salamancas. But as he is dumped on the desert floor in front of Hector, Juan Bolsa and the cousins, Nacho has other ideas. He implicates the Peruvians, as required, but quickly veered off script, calling Gus “the Chicken Man” and describing him as “a joke”. He went on: arranging Lalo’s (apparent) death was a pleasure and, in fact, “I would have done it for free because I hate every last one of you psycho sacks of shit”. Oh, and Hector, you know that heart attack that left you paralysed? That was Nacho, too. “When you’re in your shitty nursing home sucking on your jello night after night to the end of your life, I hope you think of me, you twisted fuck.” He relished every word, enjoying the freedom of the condemned man. He then revealed a shard of glass, and grabbed Bolsa by the neck. It seemed like a familiar hostage situation, but Nacho knew there was no real prospect of escape. After grabbing Bolsa’s gun and scanning his surroundings, he turned the pistol on himself. We will all have our favourite Nacho moments. For me, the one-armed Espinosa shootout, the Spider-Man-style stash-house robbery and the time he called Pryce’s hummer a vehicle for “six-year-old pimps” all feature. But while it might be a stretch to call him the heart of the show, there was certainly something more sympathetic about him. Like many of the characters, he found himself taking one step after another in the wrong direction, but his decisions seemed more understandable, his situation less accommodating. He was not an egomaniac or a sociopath – he was closer to being an ordinary guy in a bad place, although he was still a violent drug dealer. At the very end, in taking the action he did and stating clearly who he was, he managed to reclaim some control over his life. When Nacho grabbed Bolsa for his brief moment of siege, Mike was watching through his telescopic sight. “Do it,” he urged. I assume by that he wanted Nacho to kill Bolsa, with all the complications that taking out a cartel lieutenant involves. One of the questions to come out of Nacho’s demise is quite what Team Fring were hoping to get out of it. Fring wanted Nacho to make clear that he had nothing to do with Lalo’s assassination attempt, in which case, job done. Furthermore, the sudden nature of Nacho’s death meant there was no chance of any contradictory confession being made to the Salamancas. So why did Mike say what he did, and why did Gus (who held no candle for Nacho) look almost disappointed as he returned to his car? Were they hoping for more bloodshed and chaos? Back in Albuquerque, there were more questions over morality, culpability and whether to mug off the cartel. It began when Kim Wexler was confronted by the assistant district attorney, who had it on good authority that Jimmy McGill’s client, Jorge de Guzmán, was not who he said he was. Following this earth-shattering revelation, Suzanne Ericsen went on to speculate that maybe Jimmy “got in over his head” but he is still a human being, and if he were to turn state’s witness then everybody could move on. This is perhaps inadvertently getting to the nub of the matter: is Jimmy an innocent, in over his head, or someone who has actively embraced doing wrong? We’ve been watching for six seasons and it’s still in the balance (though I’d choose the latter). Kim reminded Suzanne that there’s a further detail to consider, too: it’s not Jimmy they’re talking about here, but Saul. Kim confronted Jimmy with the information he already knew, and we got to watch as she went through another moment of silent turmoil. So much of the drama of this show is expressed without words and here Kim’s face moved through a familiar wave of disgust before crashing into resolve, as she considered whether to advise Jimmy to take Suzanne’s advice. In the end, she spoke less like a pro-bono attorney and more like a mob lawyer. “Do you want to be a friend to the cartel?” she asked. “Or do you want to be a rat?” Even with all the other action, there was still time to squeeze a little scam into this episode – one with an element of improvised ingenuity about it, as Huell set up an impromptu key cutting shop in the back of a van. The game was to get Kim and Jimmy access to Howard’s personalised automobile for the next part of Operation Nasty Namaste. To pull it off, Huell pickpocketed a valet and passed Howard’s keys to his accomplice, who not only cut a new set but mimicked the signal of the key fob, which was then delivered to Jimmy on its own massive circuit board. Huell had his own moment to ponder Jimmy’s psychology, asking of the scams: “Why do you bother?” Jimmy gave him some wide-eyed waffle by way of response. Can anyone remember, did Kim ever give up smoking?

4/26/2022,"Ministers appear unlikely to make the forthcoming extra bank holiday in honour of the Queen’s platinum jubilee permanent, as Downing Street poured cold water on the plans and stressed the high cost to the economy of such a move. Business leaders – including Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden and ITV chief executive, Carolyn McCall – had launched a campaign calling for the government to consider the wider benefits of turning next month’s additional public holiday into an annual fixture. Others who backed the Friday 3 June “thank holiday” being repeated every year included the Confederation of British Industry, Hospitality UK and the archbishop of Canterbury. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were urged to consider the proposal, but No 10 suggested they were not likely to endorse it. Johnson’s spokesperson said it was a “unique” event, and added: “I’m not aware of any plans to make it permanent.” He said each bank holiday “presents a considerable and significant cost to our economy and therefore each proposal would have to be considered carefully on that basis”. While it would be kept under review, the spokesperson said a new bank holiday was estimated to cost the economy £2bn. However, the government’s official impact assessment suggested there could be a boost for the hospitality, tourism and retail sectors, while also recognising that there could be benefits for mental health and wellbeing. Campaigners also said that research they commissioned from the accountancy firm PwC showed the government’s existing figures overestimated the potential cost of a new bank holiday by 64%, while also failing to account for positive social and health benefits that are not captured by GDP figures. Meaden said the extra bank holiday would help those businesses that struggled most during the Covid pandemic. She said: “We all have fond memories of trips away, gatherings with friends, or just enjoying some relaxing time with loved ones. “But it’s also a major boon for many businesses – especially those sectors that have struggled during the pandemic. “I’m backing the campaign because I think it will be a fitting tribute to Her Majesty’s seventy years of public service, and that of all the people who make our communities kinder, nicer places to live. But I also think the ‘thank holiday’ will provide the country with a social and economic stimulus we need after a difficult few years.” Prior to the Covid pandemic, the largest monthly declines in GDP were at the time of the Queen’s golden jubilee in 2002, when output fell 2.2%, and 2012 diamond jubilee, when it fell by 1.5%. To mark this year’s bank holiday to celebrate the Queen’s 70-year reign, opening hours for pubs and bars will be extended in England and Wales – a close of 11pm being pushed back to 1am. A new 50p coin has also been made available at post offices to mark the anniversary, with the maximum mintage said to be capped at 5,000,070.",News/UK news,Hopes of permanent extra bank holiday dampened by No 10,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/jubilee-permanent-extra-bank-holiday-campaign-cost-economy
4/26/2022,"He did not like to be called a hero, but on a bright spring day the people of Cornwall turned out in force to give him a send-off fit for one. Crowds lined the streets of St Austell today to pay their respects to the D-day veteran Harry Billinge, who died earlier this month aged 96. Billinge, a sapper attached to the 44 Royal Engineer Commandos, was just 18 when he became one of the first British soldiers to land on Gold beach in Normandy in 1944. In later life, Billinge became a tireless fundraiser and was awarded an MBE after raising more than £50,000 towards a memorial for the 22,442 service personnel killed on D-day and during the Battle of Normandy. His family, friends, other veterans and many people who didn’t know him but simply wanted to say a fond farewell watched as his coffin was taken through his adopted home town of St Austell before his funeral service at St Paul’s Church in Charlestown. The singer and presenter Aled Jones performed the hymn Let There Be Peace on Earth. Nicholas Witchell of the Normandy Memorial Trust said: “Harry knew the reality – war is a terrible thing. He was determined to discharge his final duty to friends and colleagues who never came home from the battlefield. The duty to remember.” On the eve of the funeral one of his daughters, Margot Billinge, said: “Harry was a very loving husband who always looked after mum. As a dad, he taught us great values: honesty, kindness, generosity and not to judge. In an interview a few years ago I recall him saying he just wanted to be remembered as ‘a good old sapper who did his best’.” Billinge grew up in Kent but had been in Cornwall for 70 years after being advised to leave London for a better quality of life.
