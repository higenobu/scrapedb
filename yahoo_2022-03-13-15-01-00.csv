3/13/2022,"By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine's two leading suppliers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted their operations as Moscow has sharpened its attack on the country, threatening to raise prices and aggravate the semiconductor shortage. Some 45% to 54% of the world's semiconductor-grade neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, comes from two Ukrainian companies, Ingas and Cryoin, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from the companies and market research firm Techcet. Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates. Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure. The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cellphones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production. While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA. ""If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers don't have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers,"" he said. Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company's chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters. The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters. ""Civilians are suffering,"" Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company's marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access. Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the invasion began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko. Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meter of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly. She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for purifying neon. The Economy Ministry of Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chip maker TSMC, said that Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had ""safety stocks"" of neon, so it did not see any supply chain problems in the near term. The statement to Reuters echoed similar remarks from Taiwan's central bank earlier on Friday. But smaller chipmakers may be harder hit, according to Lita Shon-Roy, president of Techcet. ""The largest chip fabricators, like Intel, Samsung and TSMC, have greater buying power and access to inventories that may cover them for longer periods of time, two months or more,"" she said. ""However, many other chip fabs do not have this kind of buffer,"" she added, noting that rumors of companies trying to build up inventory have begun to circulate. ""This will compound the issue of supply availability.” Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing. The gas, which is also used in laser eye surgery, is produced in China as well, but Chinese prices are rising steadily. Bondarenko says prices, already under pressure after the pandemic, had climbed by up to 500% from December. According to a Chinese media report that cited Chinese commodity market information provider biiinfo.com, the price of neon gas (99.9% content) in China has quadrupled from 400 yuan/cubic meter in October last year to more than 1,600 yuan/cubic meter in late February. Neon prices rose 600% in the run-up to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. Companies elsewhere could initiate neon production but it would take nine months to two years to ramp up, according to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer of Supplyframe, which provides market intelligence to companies across the global electronics sectors. But CFRA's Angelo Zino noted that companies may be unwilling to invest in that process if the supply crunch is seen as temporary.

3/13/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Much has been written about the hurdles to a U.S.-Venezuela detente that would allow oil from the South American nation to start flowing more freely into international markets. One of them, though, has been overlooked: The presence of a Kremlin-owned company in oil fields all across Venezuela. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: U.S. Imposes Sanctions on More Russian Elite Biden Says He’d Fight World War III for NATO But Not for Ukraine Tech Walls Off Russia Like Never Before, Posing New Risks for U.S. Russia Bans Export of 200 Products After Suffering Sanctions Hit Satellite Images of Russian Tanks Fail to Penetrate Fog of War The company, called Roszarubezhneft, holds 40% stakes in five joint ventures with the Venezuelan state-run oil giant PDVSA. Together, they produce nearly 120,000 barrels a day of crude, or 15% of the country’s current output. Economic sanctions that have isolated Vladimir Putin’s regime, including a U.S. and U.K. ban on fossil fuel imports, following the invasion of Ukraine have pushed crude prices over $100 a barrel and sparked a scramble to find new supplies to replace Russian crude. The Biden administration sent an envoy to Caracas last weekend, breaking with a U.S. policy that for years refused to recognize Nicolas Maduro’s government, to discuss a possible waiver of some of the sanctions that have crippled Venezuela’s ability to export oil. The U.S is willing to relax economic pressure on Venezuela depending on the outcome of upcoming talks between Maduro and the opposition, a senior Biden administration official said. That indicates President Joe Biden wants to see progress toward restoring democratic governance before allowing Venezuela to increase oil exports. Maduro appears to be warming to the U.S., once a major importer of Venezuelan crude. Days after hosting the meeting in Caracas, he released former Citgo executive Gustavo Cardenas, a U.S. citizen, and Jorge Fernandez, a Cuban-American. The Venezuelan leader also said that formal talks with the opposition, which began last year in Mexico and have have been suspended for months, should be reconsidered. Putin-Chavez Agreement Russian companies boosted their presence in the country after late firebrand Hugo Chavez and Putin struck agreements in 2010 as part of Venezuela’s pivot toward Russia and China. The new allies filled the void left by a worsening relationship with Washington, providing military equipment, loans and investment in the oil industry. At the height of Russia’s presence in the country, Rosneft, Gazprom PJSC and Lukoil PJSC were among the handful of firms that held stakes in oil fields and a heavy-crude upgrader facility on the country’s Caribbean coast. Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft, invested more than $7 billion in loans to PDVSA and operations in five onshore ventures, and was also awarded two offshore gas operations. Since then, Venezuela has paid back its debt. Dealing with PDVSA has come at a cost. One of Rosneft’s trading firms was sanctioned in 2020 by the U.S. for maintaining ties with Maduro and PDVSA. To prevent additional damage, Rosneft sold all assets to Roszarubezhneft. And like other international oil majors, Russia’s ventures have diminished their output due to PDVSA’s lack of financing, maintenance and an exodus of qualified personnel. The country’s oil industry has mounted a surprising, if modest, rebound since 2020, though its total output of about 800,000 barrels a day is a fraction of the more than 3 million barrels that once made it an energy giant. Energy analysts estimate the industry can further boost production if oil can flow freely and the country is able to import much-needed parts and equipment. But the U.S. and Venezuela appear far from any agreement that would allow for widespread sanctions relief. On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki downplayed the likelihood of an agreement on oil imports coming any time soon. The same day, Venezuela Vice President Delcy Rodriguez met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Turkey to review bilateral relations. Just how the U.S. would deal with the issue that some of Venezuela’s oil is pumped with the help of Russia is not clear.

3/13/2022,"Kmart’s famous blue light is getting really, really dim. The once omnipresent retailer will see its number of U.S. locations drop to three next month, with the closing of the Avenel, N.J., store. That’s scheduled to occur on April 17, which will leave Kmart with just three locations nationwide—in Westwood, N.J., Long Island, N.Y., and Miami. At the company’s peak, there were 2,400 Kmarts in operation, with over 350,000 employees. The chain had revenues of $37 billion and owned brands including the Borders bookstore and Sports Authority. (Both of those businesses have since been acquired by former competitors.) As rivals like Walmart grew, though, Kmart stumbled, in large part because it failed to target its audience and to keep pace with modernization, especially in inventory tracking. In 2002, it filed for bankruptcy and was later bought by hedge fund magnate Eddie Lampert and merged with Sears. The combined chain limped along for several years but filed for bankruptcy itself in 2018. There are just a handful of full-line Sears stores left around the country. While both Kmart and Sears are all but memories in the brick-and-mortar space (both maintain web presences), other chains have learned that keeping just one or two locations open can sometimes be a marketing boon. The last Blockbuster video in America, in Bend, Ore., has thrived, tapping into people’s nostalgia for retailers of old.
