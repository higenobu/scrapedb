2/12/2022,"A family-owned Vietnamese restaurant that has served the local community in San Francisco’s Financial District for nearly four decades is at risk of losing its space.

SHVO, the company that owns the building, told the owners of Sai’s Vietnamese restaurant last week that the lease for their spot on Washington St. will no longer be renewed, reported KRON4.

The owners have until Feb. 28 to find a new location or a way to save their existing lease for the business, which has been serving its local clientele for 37 years.

According to Sai’s Vietnamese owner Inmy Chi, while their lease is set to expire on Feb. 28, they received an email about a renewal just days before they were told they would need to vacate their spot.

“They emailed us on Jan. 5 and asked if we wanted to renew the lease,” Chi told SFGATE. “We emailed them back on Jan. 20, but we didn’t hear from them. We called and called and on Jan. 25, they answered and said they wanted us to leave. I still have to process this. I think it unethical.”

Chi’s uncle and aunt opened the restaurant in the 1980s, and Chi took over as owner in 2017, reported SFGATE. Now, Chi is concerned for her employees, some of whom she says have worked at the establishment for 30 years and whom she describes as “part of the family.”

“Two of my staff cried when I broke the news, another is talking about where to go from here,” Chi was quoted as saying. “Many have been here for 30 years and from this moment on, I just have to move everything out and relocate my employees.”

So far, their request for an extension has been denied. This is reportedly due to a planned redevelopment work on the property, according to a spokesperson for SHVO.

“SHVO has been proud to work with Sai’s Restaurant throughout the pandemic to help the restaurant remain open, amending the family’s lease and forgiving rent on multiple occasions,” SHVO’s statement read. “While the lease is expiring and cannot be renewed for the long-term due to redevelopment work on the property, they were never evicted.""

In 2020, an application to redevelop 545 Sansome St. was filed to San Francisco Planning and is currently still under review, reported SFGATE. If approved, the project would result in the destruction of the first level of 501-505 Washington St., where the Vietnamese restaurant is located.

The family has launched a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe to help them relocate to another building nearby.

“The funds will be used directly for the costs of purchasing/building another restaurant as well as relocation expenses and purchasing new equipment,” read the campaign. “In addition, the funds will go towards retaining our employees which will allow us to continue to serve the SF community.”

2/12/2022,"The post “Extreme Suffering”: 15 of 23 Monkeys with Elon Musk’s Neuralink Brain Chips Reportedly Died appeared first on Consequence. Out of a total of 23 monkeys implanted with Elon Musk’s Neuralink brain chips at the University of California Davis between 2017 and 2020, at least 15 reportedly died. Via Business Insider and the New York Post, the news comes from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an animal-rights group that viewed over 700 pages of documents, veterinary records, and necropsy reports through a public records request at the university. Neuralink was founded in 2016 with a goal of helping people recover from traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, curing depression and other mental health disorders, and connecting humans to the internet for everything from music streaming to near-telepathic communication. The company has often touted its successes, such as a demonstration on a pig in 2020, and a 2021 video of a macaque playing Pong with its mind. The project has attracted a great deal of interest from celebrities like Grimes and Lil Uzi Vert, and people suffering from paralysis often petition Musk on social media to be a part of human trials. Musk previously said that he hoped to begin human trials in 2021, but that goal has been pushed back to 2022. Based on the PCRM’s findings, the brain chips may be nowhere near ready. “Pretty much every single monkey that had had implants put in their head suffered from pretty debilitating health effects,” said the PCRM’s research advocacy director Jeremy Beckham. “They were, frankly, maiming and killing the animals.” Neuralink chips were implanted by drilling holes into the monkeys’ skulls. One primate developed a bloody skin infection and had to be euthanized. Another was discovered missing fingers and toes, “possibly from self-mutilation or some other unspecified trauma,” and had to be put down. A third began uncontrollably vomiting shortly after surgery, and days later “appeared to collapse from exhaustion/fatigue.” An autopsy revealed the animal suffered from a brain hemorrhage. The PCRM filed a complaint with the the US Department of Agriculture on Thursday, accusing UC Davis and Neuralink of nine violations of the Animal Welfare Act. “Many, if not all, of the monkeys experienced extreme suffering as a result of inadequate animal care and the highly invasive experimental head implants during the experiments, which were performed in pursuit of developing what Neuralink and Elon Musk have publicly described as a ‘brain-machine interface,’” the group wrote in the complaint. “These highly invasive implants and their associated hardware, which are inserted in the brain after drilling holes in the animals’ skulls, have produced recurring infections in the animals, significantly compromising their health, as well as the integrity of the research.” A spokesperson for UC Davis responded to the complaint, saying, “We strive to provide the best possible care to animals in our charge. Animal research is strictly regulated, and UC Davis follows all applicable laws and regulations including those of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.” The spokesperson added that the university stopped working with Neuralink in 2020. Neuralink has not issued a response. “Extreme Suffering”: 15 of 23 Monkeys with Elon Musk’s Neuralink Brain Chips Reportedly Died Wren Graves Popular Posts Kanye Threatens to Boycott Coachella Unless Billie Eilish Apologizes to Travis Scott World's Worst Rapper Arrested in $4.5 Billion Crypto Crime Dave Chappelle Helps Nix Affordable Housing Plan in Ohio Village Eddie Vedder Won't Let Mötley Crüe Feud Go, Takes Swipe at Tommy Lee Bob Saget Died From Brain Trauma Disturbed's David Draiman Slams ""Hypocritical"" Trevor Noah over Joe Rogan Takedown Subscribe to Consequence of Sound’s email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox.",Health/Consequence of Sound,“Extreme Suffering”: 15 of 23 Monkeys with Elon Musk’s Neuralink Brain Chips Reportedly Died,https://news.yahoo.com/extreme-suffering-15-23-monkeys-205653491.html
2/12/2022,"It was four years ago when Christian Maire sobbed in court and begged for mercy for running a child porn ring that targeted vulnerable teenage girls on the Internet, manipulated them into performing sex acts online and even convinced some to cut themselves while the predators watched. One year later, he wound up dead — kicked, stomped, stabbed and thrown down a flight of stairs in the federal prison in Milan, Mich. Among the attackers was a convicted bank robber, who this week admitted to his crime, showing no emotion as he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and explained to a federal judge what he did. Adam Wright, nicknamed ""Creeper,"" admitted that he kicked and stomped Wright in the head on Jan. 2, 2019. According to his plea agreement, Wright did this while an inmate nicknamed ""Sniper"" stabbed Maire with a shank, while also stomping and kicking Wright. After the attack, Wright, ""Sniper"" and a third inmate threw Maire's body down a flight of metal stairs, his plea agreement states. ""He has expressed great remorse for what he did,"" Wright's attorney, Jim Thomas, told the Free Press Friday. Under the terms of his plea deal, Wright faces up to 27 years and three months in prison when he is sentenced in June. His co-defendants, 41-year-old Alex Castro, also known as ""Sniper"" 41, and 40-year-old Jason Kechego, nicknamed ""J"" - were also charged. Their cases are pending. In court documents, the government has portrayed the three inmates as a violent crew that sent fear in the prison community, alleging that Maire was not their only victim. More: Ex-Wayne County Airport Authority official found dead after failing to report to prison More: Cop says Ethan Crumbley texted friend: 'I'm mentally and physically dying' ""Defendants brutally murdered another inmate and severely assaulted other inmates and prison staff while in a federal prison,"" prosecutors wrote in a Feb. 8 court filing. ""Their brazen and violent acts were on display for their fellow inmates to see, causing them to fear possible repercussions of cooperating in any manner with this investigation and prosecution."" They added: ""Castro and Wright shouted out warnings of potential future violence towards other inmates."" Wright, 41, of Springfield, Ill., entered his plea Thursday in U.S. District Court in Detroit — the same courthouse that Maire and his cohorts were sentenced in years ago for exploiting vulnerable girls. For five years, prosecutors said, nine online predators pretending to be teenage boys sexually exploited more than 100 girls nationwide, including an Oakland County girl who helped the FBI bust the scheme in 2017. At their sentencing hearings, the defendants came face to face with some of their still-traumatized victims, who persuaded a judge to lock the men up for decades for robbing their innocence and trust, and for destroying their childhoods. ""Thinking back to those days causes me to cry myself to sleep, wondering when the monsters will stop haunting me,"" one victim told the judge. The ringleader was Maire, a 40-year-old married father of two from New York who was sentenced to 40 years in prison for running an online porn operation that was dubbed ""The Bored Group."" Prosecutors said the group targeted lonely girls, and even had ""trust-building"" sessions for girls who were suicidal or revealed that that they were cutting themselves. The group's victims ranged in ages 10-17. ""I'm really so ashamed of myself and all the harm I've caused my victims,"" Maire told U.S. District Judge Stephen Murphy at his sentencing, sobbing at times. ""I never knew I could sink this low ... but I am sick. Pornography led me down a very dark road. If I was here as a parent instead of a defendant, I would be devastated."" Maire had three supporters speak on his behalf, including a priest, a family friend and his father, who apologized to the victims. As Maire's supporters asked for leniency, a victim in the courtroom whispered to a friend: ""But they asked girls to cut themselves.""
