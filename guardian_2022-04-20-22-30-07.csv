4/20/2022,"Downing Street has gone into open battle with the Church of England over its condemnation of the Rwanda deportation scheme, after No 10 officials doubled down on Boris Johnson’s criticism that archbishops were being unfairly critical. After Johnson told prime minister’s questions he was “slightly taken aback” by comments from the archbishops of Canterbury and York, his press secretary declined to deny the PM had claimed the church was being more vocal about the asylum policy than in its criticism of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in a statement on Wednesday, Lambeth Palace said Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, would continue to speak out about the plan to deport asylum seekers arriving in the UK to Rwanda on “moral and ethical grounds”, setting the ground for an ongoing fight over the policy. A series of reports said that following Tuesday’s Commons apology after being fined for breaking lockdown rules, Johnson told a meeting of Conservative MPs that Welby and the BBC had focused more on criticising the government than condemning Russia and Vladimir Putin. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, accused Johnson at PMQs of “attacking the institutions of our great country”, adding: “That’s how he operates. A mealy-mouthed apology when the cameras roll. A vicious attack on those who tell the truth as soon as the cameras are off.” Johnson denied attacking the BBC, saying: “I said nothing of the kind, and I have the highest admiration, as a former journalist, for what journalists do.” The idea he had attacked the BBC was “completely without any foundation whatever”, he said. But asked by Starmer if he would “like to take this opportunity to apologise for slandering the archbishop and the Church of England”, Johnson said only that he was “slightly taken aback for the government to be criticised over the policy that we have devised” on Rwanda. Speaking after PMQs. Johnson’s press secretary said that while she could not comment on comments made at a private meeting, she stressed Johnson had not criticised the BBC for their coverage of Ukraine. Asked what Johnson thought about the church’s criticisms of the Rwanda plan, as against its comments on Russia, she said: “You heard him answer the first point, where he said he was surprised to be criticised for a policy that is designed to end deaths at sea that are a result of people being exploited by criminal gangs.” The church spokesperson said: “The archbishops of Canterbury and York have condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an act of great evil and spoken out repeatedly against it. In his Easter sermon the archbishop of Canterbury spoke of the suffering and terror being experienced by Ukrainians, called on Russia to withdraw its forces and said ‘let the darkness of war be banished’.” Separately, Labour has said it will publicise the votes of any Conservative MPs who oppose a motion being debated in the Commons on Thursday which seeks to have the Commons privileges committee investigate whether Johnson misled MPs by initially saying no Covid rules had been broken in Downing Street. The motion – jointly tabled by Labour, the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru, Greens, SDLP and Alliance parties – sets out that the committee should look into whether a series of denials of wrongdoing by Johnson “appear to amount to misleading the house”, given Johnson and others have now been fined. The committee inquiry would not conclude before the end of the ongoing Met police investigation, the motion says, trying to head off possible objections or amendments by the government. Asked if the motion would be used in part to highlight Tory MPs who oppose it, a spokesperson for Starmer said: “We certainly think that anyone who doesn’t support our motion is sending a message that they don’t believe that honesty and integrity matters in public life. “We will be absolutely looking to ensure that there is a price for Conservative MPs in the way in which we campaign, and the advertising that we will be putting out in individual constituencies, highlighting the fact that individual Tory MPs have decided not to support an investigation into these matters.”",News/Politics,No 10 doubles down on Johnson’s criticism of archbishops over Rwanda plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/pmqs-boris-johnson-denies-bbc-criticism-no-justin-welby-apology
4/20/2022,"Schools and other public buildings in Italy will be forbidden from setting their air conditioning to any setting lower than 25C from next month, under a scheme intended to help the country dodge an energy crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The energy rationing initiative, called “operation thermostat”, comes as two Italian ministers travel to central Africa on Wednesday in search of alternative gas suppliers to Russia, from where Italy imports about 45% of its natural gas. A debate over energy squandered through air conditioning arose after the prime minister, Mario Draghi, ironically used air conditioning as an example of something Italians might have to sacrifice in return for peace in Ukraine. “Do we want to have peace or do we want to have the air conditioning on?” he said earlier this month, after pledging that Italy would comply if the EU decided to impose an embargo on Russian gas. The rules will begin on 1 May and be in place until 31 March next year, with heating in public buildings during winter not permitted to exceed 19C. It is not yet clear how the measure will be policed, but inspectors from the ministry of labour could undertake controls, with those flouting the limits fined between €500 and €3,000, Il Messaggero reported. The measure does not apply to hospitals but may eventually be extended to private homes. Renato Brunetta, the minister for public administration, said the initiative, introduced by the Five Star Movement, was a “positive” sign and would save 2-4bn cubic metres of gas a year. About 57% of the energy costs of a public office building comes from temperature control. Angela Masi, a politician with the Five Star Movement, said: “It’s correct that the public administration is setting a good example, cutting waste and raising awareness among citizens about rationalising consumption. It’s a simple way to contribute and reduce dependency on gas.” After travelling to Algeria last week to strike a gas deal, Draghi was forced to cancel trips to Angola and the Republic of the Congo after testing positive for Covid-19. He is instead sending his foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, and Roberto Cingolani, the minister of ecological transition. In an interview with Corriere della Sera on Sunday, Draghi said: “We do not want to depend on Russian gas any longer, because economic dependence must not become political subjection. Diversification is possible and can be implemented in a relatively short amount of time – quicker than we imagined just a month ago.”",News/World news,‘Operation thermostat’: Italy limits air conditioning amid energy crisis fears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/operation-thermostat-italy-limits-air-conditioning-amid-energy-crisis-fears
4/20/2022,"Wildlife officials in Florida are investigating the mysterious death of a bottlenose dolphin that was recovered on a beach with an apparent stab wound to the head. The mammal, which was found on Fort Myers beach in the south-west of the state on 24 March, is believed to have been killed deliberately, probably while it was being fed illegally by humans. “Based on the shape, size and characteristics of the wound, it is suspected that the dolphin was impaled while in a begging position,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) said in a statement. “Begging is not a natural behavior for dolphins and is frequently associated with illegal feeding.” The dolphin was an adult lactating female, and was above water with its mouth open when it was attacked, NBC News reported. Its carcass was recovered by the Florida fish and wildlife commission, whose officers passed details on to Noaa. “A necropsy, non-human autopsy, revealed the dolphin was impaled in the head with a spear-like object while alive,” the Noaa statement said. “Further examination indicated the wound, above the right eye, was inflicted before the animal died. The animal appeared to have died from the trauma, which occurred at or near the time of death.” The agency is seeking information about the incident and has an enforcement hotline where tips can be left anonymously. Violent incidents toward dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico are not uncommon. The latest incident brings to at least 27 the number washed up to shore after being shot by guns or arrows, or impaled with sharp objects since 2002. Harassing, harming, killing or feeding wild dolphins is prohibited under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, with fines of up to $100,000 and up to a year in jail for each violation. Experts say illegal feeding of marine mammals is harmful to more than just the individual being fed. “Those dolphins have learned to associate humans with food. Once they learn that, they also teach it to other dolphins and they teach it to their babies,” Laura Engelby, Noaa marine mammal branch chief, told WBBH News. According to the Noaa statement, “Dolphins fed by people learn to associate people, boats, and fishing gear with food, which puts dolphins and people in harmful situations.”",News/US news,Dolphin’s stabbing death investigated by Florida wildlife officials,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/20/dolphin-stabbing-death-florida
4/20/2022,"After my husband, Luke, took his life, I promised to take our son to watch every Leicester City FC home game. It had been a father and son tradition, and I wanted to carry it on. But every time we went, we couldn’t escape the gambling adverts around the stadium. The word “bet” was everywhere, flashing at us like a command. It was a reminder for my son of his dad’s gambling addiction, and I watched as he shrank into his seat. We have not been back. Gambling adverts are everywhere – not just around football grounds and on players’ shirts, but on the radio and on the way to school, magnified on billboards, in magazine inserts, in so many TV ad breaks and all over the internet. There is nowhere to hide. The full normalisation of gambling as a fun and risk-free activity is completed by the long list of celebrities who front those ads. From José Mourinho claiming he’s “the Special One” because he won online, Ray Winstone bellowing at you to bang a bet on, and Keith Lemon offering you a so-called “free bet”, they are hard to ignore. The Committee of Advertising Practice recently announced that, from October, it will ban UK gambling ads featuring celebrities, sportspeople and social media influencers who would be likely to appeal to children. This is a welcome step, but nowhere near enough. Before Luke died, he talked about the relentlessness of gambling adverts. I didn’t know then that he was struggling with a life-threatening illness brought on by the addictive products those adverts sold. A 2021 Public Health England report estimates that there are more than 400 gambling-related suicides in England every year – more than one a day. And with more than 55,000 children addicted to gambling in the UK, the next generation is being groomed. The way the gambling industry advertises is despicable. It claims to promote “safer gambling” while using every trick to encourage people to bet. The responsibility is always on the gambler, with safety slogans such as “When the fun stops, stop” or “Take time to think”, but never anything on the real dangers of gambling (“Gambling kills”), never highlighting the highly addictive nature of online casino games, in-play betting, or predatory gambling industry practices such as VIP schemes and free bets and bonuses. Luke was drawn in by these “free bets”. These offers entice people to sign up to sites with free credit to spend, free spins, or odds that seem too good to be true. When Luke tried to stop, it was these free bets that pulled him back into a gambling nightmare in the weeks before he died. Industry lobbyists say gambling advertising does not cause people to gamble, citing a “flawed” University of Liverpool study to back this up. This is premium-grade gaslighting. Why would the UK gambling industry spend £1.5bn a year on advertising if it was having no effect? It’s because 86% of online betting profits come from just 5% of customers – those addicted or at risk. If you are bankrupting and killing your best customers, you must replace them. Stopping celebrities from promoting gambling now feels like a half-baked measure, sold to us to avoid what really needs to happen. We are close to what could be the biggest shake-up of our gambling laws, with the 2005 Gambling Act currently under review. That legislation, which opened the floodgates to the dangerous levels of advertising we see today, came into force in 2007 – it was drawn up before the first iPhone came to market. With most gambling and gambling advertising now happening online, our laws are hopelessly out of date. There has been delay after delay in releasing the review white paper that will set out the proposed changes. Right at the top, along with an end to “free bets”, needs to be an end to all gambling advertising. Every day of delay is another life lost. More than 500 people have already died because of gambling since the review began, and one of those was my husband. This is why I’ve set up a petition calling on the gambling minister, Chris Philp, to publish the white paper now. Just as the tobacco industry resisted a ban on smoking ads, the gambling industry is lobbying hard to keep the status quo. Cigarette firms argued that Formula One would not survive without their ad revenue, which was wrong, and now betting firms say football can’t live without gambling advertising. This too is, of course, nonsense – there are now dozens of clubs surviving without it and campaigning against it. Football was fine before 2007 and it will be again. One day I hope I can take my son to see the football, travel with him in the car, sit with him watching TV, and let him scroll the internet or chat to his friends on social media without worrying he is being targeted by a gambling firm. I owe it not just to him, but to Luke, to do my best to ensure this white paper puts an end to gambling advertising.

4/20/2022,"The Queen has travelled to her Norfolk estate where she will celebrate her 96th birthday in low-key fashion at the farmhouse where the Duke of Edinburgh spent much of his retirement. The monarch flew from Windsor Castle to her Sandringham estate where she is likely to spend several days at Wood Farm, the home Prince Philip moved to after his retirement in August 2017. She visited him frequently until the Covid pandemic necessitated his moving to shield with her at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace is not planning any kind of public engagement to mark her birthday on Thursday, though there will be tributes from family members and organisations she is involved with. It is expected the Queen will be visited by family and friends over the next few days during her short holiday. She has no major confirmed engagements in her diary. Recent mobility issues have led her to cancel a string of engagements and it is not yet known which events planned for her platinum jubilee in June she will attend. Wood Farm, which is a modest residence by royal standards, has a more informal air than nearby Sandringham House. Philip, who died in April 2021 at the age of 99, loved the house, especially the fact that “the sea was so close”, the Queen has said. She commented on the property when she hosted a rare public event at Sandringham on 5 February. Its retired housekeeper Teresa Thompson, 70, said at the time: “All the royal family love Wood Farm because it’s out of the way, it’s small, it’s intimate. You haven’t got lots of officials and household, it’s just close staff.” The Queen usually spends Christmas on the Norfolk estate, only departing after the anniversary of the death of her father, George VI, on 6 February. The fact that it is also where Philip chose to retire after stepping down from public life can only strengthen her emotional ties to Sandringham.",News/UK news,Queen to celebrate 96th birthday at Sandringham,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/queen-celebrate-96th-birthday-sandringham
4/20/2022,"The 22-time grand slam doubles champion Pam Shriver says she had an “inappropriate and damaging relationship” with her coach which started when she was a teenager, and has warned that similar scenarios are commonplace in tennis. In an article for the Daily Telegraph published on Wednesday, Shriver, who is now 59 and a respected broadcaster, says she started to work with Don Candy when she was nine. The Australian was her coach as she began her rise to the top of the game, and she eventually reached the final of the US Open as a 16-year-old amateur. When she was 17 she told the 50-year-old Candy she was falling in love with him and they went on to have an affair. “I still have conflicted feelings about Don,” Shriver writes. “Yes, he and I became involved in a long and inappropriate affair. Yes, he was cheating on his wife. But there was a lot about him that was honest and authentic. And I loved him. Even so, he was the grown-up here. He should have been the trustworthy adult. In a different world, he would have found a way to keep things professional. Only after therapy did I start to feel a little less responsible. Now, at last, I’ve come to realise that what happened is on him.” Shriver says Candy, who died in 2020, did not sexually abuse her but the relationship “stunted my ability to form normal relationships and set certain patterns which would recur: my ongoing attraction to older men and my difficulties in understanding how to maintain healthy boundaries.” Shriver believes her story is far from unique. “I believe abusive coaching relationships are alarmingly common in sport as a whole,” she says. “My particular expertise, though, is in tennis, where I have witnessed dozens of instances in my four-and-a-bit decades as a player and commentator. Every time I hear about a player who is dating their coach, or I see a male physio working on a female body in the gym, it sets my alarm bells ringing.” Shriver said the relationship, particularly her guilt towards Candy’s wife, Elaine, had a negative effect on her game. The relationship ended when he sought out a new coach, although she continued to keep in touch with Candy as a consultant. Abuse of athletes has become a prominent topic in recent years. Shriver suggests some ways tennis could address the problem. “As far as solutions go, I don’t have all the answers. I think it’s possible to educate young athletes, but you probably have to start before they even reach puberty: maybe when they’re 11, 12 or 13. By the time they graduate to the main tennis tour, many patterns have already been set,” she says. “And then there’s the coaches. The best way to protect their charges is to put them through an education process before they arrive on tour. The same goes for other credential-holders: physios, fitness trainers and so on. The point has to be made very clearly: these kinds of relationships are not appropriate, and there will be consequences for those who cross the line.”",Sport/Sport,Pam Shriver had ‘traumatic’ relationship with 50-year-old coach when she was 17,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/20/pam-shriver-had-traumatic-affair-with-50-year-old-coach-when-she-was-17
4/20/2022,"Even before the final Sue Gray inquiry is published, the public may feel it already knows the inside story of the Downing Street parties in granular details – from suitcases of wine, to broken swings and DJ sets in the basement. But given the sheer number of photographs that the Met police have been handed to examine – more than 300 – it is perhaps surprising that more have not found their way into the media. The Guardian published a photograph taken of the Downing Street garden in May 2020, with Boris and Carrie Johnson sitting in the sunshine with glasses of wine along with aides including Dominic Cummings and Martin Reynolds. Other screengrabs of the No 10 Christmas quiz have been published. But none has emerged from the most egregious breaches that have been reported, including the summer party where staffers were asked to “bring your own booze” or the leaving parties for staff, including one on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral. Some ex-officials who have attended the parties are convinced that the lack of pictures is the key reason why Johnson has been able to successfully spin a version that allows him to convince MPs that he believed that those he attended were work events. Many of the pictures are understood to have been snapped by Andrew Parsons, Johnson’s official photographer on the No 10 payroll. Some allies of Johnson have used this as a way to explain why the PM remained so convinced he was doing nothing wrong – he was content to allow himself to be photographed. Those pictures have never been published but are believed to form part of Gray’s inquiry and the evidence she handed to the Met police. One Tory source said the photographs of Johnson’s birthday gathering in the cabinet room – the only event for which he has been fined – would raise serious doubts about Johnson’s version of events there and would demonstrate it had been a significant celebratory gathering in breach of the rules. But there are also believed to be a significant number of other photographs taken by aides on their mobile phones at more than a dozen gatherings. The Met police have said they will not release the photographs and it is doubtful whether the final report from Gray’s inquiry will include them. The existence of the images is one of the key reasons why Johnson will be so keen to block a parliamentary inquiry into his conduct. Separate from the Whitehall and police inquiries, this would look specifically at whether the prime minister purposely misled parliament. Such an inquiry is highly unlikely because Tory MPs will block it. But in theory the committee could call for papers – including the photographs – and summon witnesses. It is only the images that could ultimately prove whether Johnson has misled the House of Commons with his version of the events he attended – and his assertions that the guidance was followed at all times.",News/Politics,Why pictures of Downing Street parties could be smoking gun,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/20/why-pictures-of-downing-street-parties-could-be-smoking-gun
4/20/2022,"Ilove ferries. Give me a ferry over a flight any day of the week, and I’d rather take a ferry than the Channel tunnel every time. All that burrowing along under the sea with no sea to look at: what’s that all about? I need the thrill of the land fading astern and new land coming to the fore. Down below, in the tunnel, it’s rubbish – nothing to look at apart from your watch telling you when the 35-minute crossing is over. Crossing? Even the word sounds wrong for something that goes under the sea rather than over it. No, ferries are my thing. They’re never scrupulously clean or particularly tidy; they’re too functional for that. And I’ve never been on a ferry that didn’t look as if it had seen better days. But they present themselves as rather pleasingly worn in, rather than worn out. And best of all, they’re never fancy. I’m against fanciness in all things. I know there have been attempts to fancify ferries, or parts of them, with business-class areas and whatnot, but to no avail. They’re never going to feel very exclusive. I boarded the Douglas ferry last week, the one from Liverpool, alongside another motorcyclist called Tony. As usual, I marvelled at the sight and smell of the grime on the car deck. Ferries, like garden centres, doctor’s surgeries and bike shops, have a smell that is all their own. Upstairs, the scent mingles in your nostrils with notes of chips, tea, beer, cleaning fluids and fresh sea air. The voyage can begin. My new friend Tony kindly invited me to be his guest in the business lounge. Knowing the Isle of Man is home to a tax-efficient high roller or two, I was half expecting fine champagne, ingenious canapés or even a hot tub. But, this being a ferry, there was no such thing, and I was only too happy to partake of Tony’s company, complimentary triangles of quartered sandwiches and little bowls of crisps. No, there’s nowt fancy on ferries. They are classless places, for all sorts. This is something you can take in at your leisure, as ships are the only mode of transit I can think of on which you can take a proper stroll. There’s always the same mixed crowd: retirees spending the kids’ inheritance on meticulously planned road trips; worn out young families on budget holidays; the regulars, such as truck drivers, plying their trades; and booze cruisers on the lash, whatever the time or the weather. And, whatever the weather, there is always someone being – or at least looking – ill. All human life is here, and it feels like we’re all in the same boat, as well as on the same boat. All in the same boat, that is, unless you’re sailing with P&O Ferries (which doesn’t operate this route), in which case the crew members might well be paid a good deal less than the least well-paid person on the passenger list. Suddenly, without warning, the ship shudders and slows and the spell is broken. The voyage is over. People stand up, gather their things and stride purposely away. Everyone seems to have more of an idea of what to do than me. To be honest, this is what my life feels like most of the time. I’m all fingers and thumbs and mislaid things, with not a clue about the best way to get to my motorbike on the grime deck. Eventually I find it, climb aboard and join the queue rattling down the ramp as we all head off to get on with the rest of our lives.

4/20/2022,"The US dating giant behind Tinder and OkCupid has won a court battle with a British dating app for Muslims after accusing it of copying its product and services. Muzmatch, the world’s largest Muslim dating and marriage app, could lose the right to use its name following the legal battle with Match Group, which also owns Hinge and Match.com. The UK intellectual property and enterprise court ruled that Muzmatch had infringed the trademark of Match Group, which claims to have “pioneered the concept of online dating” more than 20 years ago. In his judgment, the deputy high court judge Nicholas Caddick QC stated that this “would have led some consumers to assume that the goods and services offered by Muzmatch were somehow connected with or derived from Match”. The US conglomerate, which has a market capitalisation of about $37bn, accused Muzmatch of “piggybacking on established dating brands” to improve its success. It argued that Muzmatch, which has 6 million users worldwide, used “match” and “Tinder” in its website metadata to drive internet traffic to the platform. According to the American company, the British firm also used keyword tags including “match-muslim” and “uk-muslim-match”, which it claimed were an attempt to “ride on the coattails” of Match’s registered trademarks. A Match Group spokesperson said: “We are pleased that the court recognised what we have known to be true: that Muzmatch has unfairly benefited from Match Group’s reputation and investment in its brand and was riding Match Group’s coattails for undeserved gain in this highly competitive market. We have, and will always protect the work, creativity and innovations of our employees, and are grateful that the court recognised this and ruled accordingly.” Muzmatch’s chief executive, Shahzad Younas, said he would appeal against the judgment but vowed to continue the platform, even if it meant rebranding. Younas, 37, a former Morgan Stanley banker who launched Muzmatch in 2011 with the aim of providing a safe environment for single Muslims to meet online, added that he had spent $1m fighting Match Group in court in the UK and the US. He added: “The number of Muslims in the community, Muslim organisations, and individuals, businesses, etc, who’ve said: ‘I’m so glad that you’re fighting this and you didn’t back down’ … For them, there was a principle at stake. In their eyes, and we’ve heard this from customers as well, it’s so important that a Muslim-led startup creates products for the community.” In its defence, Muzmatch said it had chosen the Muzmatch mark as a play on “Muslim” and “match”. The company argued that its website and app clearly stated that it provided matchmaking and introduction services for Muslims who were looking for marriage, in accordance with Islamic values. Match Group wrote to Muzmatch in 2016 alleging acts of trademark infringement and a year later it tried to acquire the company. In total, four offers to acquire the business were made, including one for $35m, according to Muzmatch, which rejected them. Match said it was approached by Younas for acquisition talks. Match Group subsequently bought Harmonica, an Egyptian Muslim matchmaking app, which it renamed Hawaya. Match has previously been involved in legal disputes with the founders of rival Bumble and Tinder.",News/Law,Dating app Muzmatch may have to change name after trademark row,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/20/dating-app-muzmatch-may-have-to-change-name-after-trademark-row

He said: “There is a significant campaign within the organisation to deal with this completely unacceptable behaviour, to root it out and to exit those people who are exhibiting that behaviour from the organisation as fast as possible and in the right way.” Asked if it was “just a few people”, he replied: “People have talked about a few bad apples, quite clearly that’s not the situation at all, it’s not a few bad apples. “You can’t simply say that Wayne Couzens and a couple of other people have done something wrong – that’s been the spearhead of the problem, I would suggest, but there is a wider issue within the organisation which we acknowledge and we are dealing with.” Inquiries identified a lack of supervision in the parliamentary and diplomatic protection unit where Couzens served when he carried out his crimes, House said. Racist and sexist social media postings by members of the unit, which guards the Houses of Parliament and VIPs, were disclosed last month. One sent an edited picture showed George Floyd in his final moments, alongside the caption “Pink Floyd”. Another doctored photo featured the critically injured BLM activist Sasha Johnson, in a T-shirt that read ‘Black Lives Splatter”. House said officers had launched a root-and-branch inquiry into the unit’s culture and realised that supervising officers had little to do with the rank and file. “Supervisors can set tone and set attitudes and deal with very low level poor behaviour early on. We find in our review of parliamentary and diplomatic protection that the supervisory levels are too low. That the mode of working is they don’t see their supervisors enough and the supervisors don’t know the officers well enough simply because there aren’t enough of them,” he said. MPs were told officers who were consistently rude to the public or targeted people for stop and search on the grounds of their race should be rooted out “as fast as possible”. Questioned by Tim Loughton, the Conservative veteran committee member, House said senior officers were sometimes prevented from sacking colleagues for misconduct immediately because of lengthy criminal inquiries. “One of the classic problems for us is an officer who has carried out an action which is misconduct but looks as if it may also be criminal which will then get referred to the CPS,” he said. “Investigations can go on in parallel, sometimes it is easier if the criminal investigation goes first. There are times when probably out of frustration I think to myself ‘I’d rather sack this person now rather than wait 18 months for them to go to court, possibly get found not guilty and then we have to go through a misconduct process’..” House said in less serious criminal cases, it would be better for public trust and the public purse if the Met’s misconduct procedures could take precedence. “We would get rid of them quickly and justice would be seen to be done,” he said. Police forces in England and Wales are trying to recruit 20,000 officers by next year to replace jobs cut during austerity measures. House said he was now “less confident” that the Met would meet its targets, with the force needing to attract 40,000 applicants in the next year to replace officers who leave as well as attracting 1,800 new starters. He said: “We need to recruit just over 4,000 officers in the next 12 months. That means we need around about 40,000 applications in the next 12 months because we take roughly one in 10 of the people who apply to us.”",News/UK news,"Met police culture problems ‘not just a few bad apples’, says acting head",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/20/met-police-culture-problems-not-just-a-few-bad-apples-says-acting-head
4/20/2022,"Little Simz has cancelled her upcoming US tour, citing the financial unviability of the undertaking as an independent artist. “I take my live shows seriously and would only want to give you guys nothing but the best of me,” the 28-year-old rapper and actor, born Simbiatu Ajikawo, tweeted. “Being an independent artist, I pay for everything encompassing my live performances out of my own pocket and touring the US for a month would leave me in a huge deficit. As much as this pains me to not see you at this time, I’m just not able to put myself through that mental stress.” The 11-date tour was due to commence in May. It would have been the first time that Simz had showcased her widely acclaimed 2021 album, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, in the US. A representative for the musician could not confirm whether the cancellation would also affect her planned dates in Canada and South America. Simz advised artists to “know your worth and stick to your guns”. Her announcement comes at a time of renewed awareness of how difficult it is for independent musicians to make a living – and defies assumptions that live performance is one of the last bankable certainties that they have on their side. Last week the Guardian revealed that Universal Music Group is profiting from the 25% cut that Academy Music Group venues take from merchandise sales in its venues. This month the acclaimed North Carolina indie band Wednesday – which has 250k monthly listeners on Spotify – went viral after detailing the economics of playing seven shows at Texas industry festival SXSW, which left them $98.39 in debt. “We are technically a band that is ‘doing very well’ at the moment!” Wednesday frontperson Karly Hartzman tweeted. “I ain’t complaining abt doing my dream job, but do wanna show why being paid fairly from streaming would make a difference.” In January, the UK’s competitions watchdog launched an in-depth study into music streaming to assess whether the big record labels and services such as Spotify hold “excessive power”, and whether artists and fans are getting a fair deal. It came after a scathing report by a cross-party committee of MPs in 2021 called for a “complete reset” of a streaming model it believed only benefited big labels and superstar acts. Independent music lovers have also been left shaken by the sale of Bandcamp, a streaming and sales site that has prioritised better revenues for creators, to Epic Games in March. Simz told fans that it was important to her to “speak my truth about this” and said she intended to tour the US when she could. She said she was busy “creating and working on art” in different media: as well as music, she stars in the Netflix series Top Boy will appear in the upcoming Amazon Prime Video adaptation of Naomi Alderman’s 2016 novel The Power, and has produced her own comic books. In February, Simz was named best new artist at the Brit awards. Despite having released her debut album more than six years earlier, she only became eligible for the award when Sometimes I Must Be Introvert reached No 4 in the UK albums chart: artists must have had a Top 40 album or two Top 20 singles to qualify.",Arts/Music,Little Simz cancels US tour citing financial unviability as an indie artist,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/20/little-simz-cancels-us-tour-citing-financial-unviability-indie-artist
4/20/2022,"The televised candidates’ debate between the two rounds of the French presidential election has been a political tradition for nearly 50 years and is seen as having swung the result on several occasions, particularly in close-run races. France’s first live presidential debate pitted the first secretary of the Socialist party against the centrist finance minister. The debate is best remembered for the stinging riposte the victorious Giscard flung at his rival, who had argued that the redistribution of wealth should be “a question of heart, not just intelligence”. Giscard replied: “You do not have a monopoly on the heart, Mr Mitterrand.” The two met again seven years later, with Mitterrand out for revenge. Giscard tried to lecture his challenger, demanding he quote the exchange rate between the French franc and the German mark, prompting Mitterrand to riposte: “I’m not your student!” But it was the Socialist who landed the knockout blow. “You don’t want to talk about the past, I naturally understand that,” he told the outgoing president – before deliberately labelling the aloof, patrician Giscard as “the man of the past”. Himself the incumbent, Mitterrand in 1988 faced off against his centre-right prime minister. Their debate featured a memorable putdown by France’s first Socialist head of state after Chirac repeatedly called him “Mr Mitterrand” on the not unreasonable grounds that “tonight I’m not the prime minister, and you’re not the president of the Republic ... We’re two equal candidates.” Mitterrand coolly shot back: “You are quite right – Mr Prime Minister.” He was re-elected. This time Chirac won against a new Socialist rival, but their excessively polite TV showdown has been largely forgotten bar an aside from Jospin, who was campaigning to cut the presidential term from seven years to five, to the effect that the country would surely rather have “five years of Jospin than seven years of Chirac”. The country decided otherwise. In the aftermath of the political earthquake unleashed by Jean-Marie Le Pen’s advance to the second round, Chirac refused to debate the far right Front National leader (and father of Marine), declaring: “Faced with intolerance and hatred, no compromise, no debate, is possible. One must have the courage of one’s convictions and the constancy of one’s commitments.” He went on to defeat the former paratrooper in a landslide despite the latter accusing him of “copping out”. The Socialist candidate was the first woman to reach a French presidential runoff and would not stand for what she saw as the condescension of the centre-right interior minister in an exchange over education for children with learning difficulties. After Sarkozy told her to “calm down and stop pointing your finger at me”, Royal replied: “No, I won’t calm down!” Sarkozy insisted: “To be president of the Republic, you have to be calm.” Royal hit back: “No, not when there is injustice! A healthy anger corresponds to people’s suffering. That’s the anger I would have as president.” It did not convince the voters. Seeking re-election, the tough-talking Sarkozy taunted the Socialist candidate ruthlessly, at one stage calling him “a little slanderer” and flatly accusing him of lying. Hollande, however, who had campaigned throughout on the promise that he would be a “normal president” in contrast to Sakozy’s “bling bling” tenancy of the Elysée palace, found the perfect riposte, delivering an extemporised three-minute series of statements all beginning “As president of the Republic, I …” that for once left his right-wing rival speechless. Hollande went on to win. The 2017 debate between the centrist and his far-right, populist rival is widely considered to have knocked a full six points off Le Pen’s final score in the runoff, so brutally was she dismantled by the former Socialist economy minister. Over-aggressive from the start, the Rassemblement National (National Rally) leader became increasingly muddled, flapping through her notes while Macron calmly pointed out her misconceptions and policy shortcomings. To her claim that he was “the candidate of uncontrolled globalisation, Uberisation, social precarity” while she was “the candidate of the people”, he riposted: “You have, in any case, amply demonstrated that you are hardly the candidate of finesse.”",News/World news,‘Stop pointing your finger at me!’: 50 years of French election TV debates,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/stop-pointing-your-finger-at-me-50-years-of-french-election-tv-debates
