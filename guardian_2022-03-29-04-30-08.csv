3/29/2022,"Mira Calix, the electronic producer celebrated for her complex, highly imaginative music and sound art, has died. Her label, Warp Records, announced the news, and did not give a cause of death, nor her age. A statement posted to social media said in part: “Mira was not only a hugely talented artist and composer, she was also a beautiful, caring human who touched the lives of everyone who had the honour of working with her … she pushed the boundaries between electronic music, classical music and art in a truly unique way.” Born Chantal Passamonte in South Africa, Calix moved to London in 1991 to pursue a career in music, first working as a publicist for Warp alongside promoting club nights and DJing, before releasing her music with the label. Like her labelmates, her work realised the broad possibilities of electronic production in playful and adventurous music that had roots in club culture but spanned a remarkably broad stylistic range, touching on ambient, noise, neo-classical and more. She released music in the traditional album format, beginning in 2000 with One on One and most recently with the sample-heavy Absent Origin, released in 2021 and hailed as one of her greatest works. But she also made music for installations such as My Secret Heart, staged at London’s Royal Festival Hall in 2008, and the monolithic sound sculpture Nothing Is Set In Stone, created for the Cultural Olympiad alongside the London 2012 Olympics, with Boris Johnson, then London mayor, stating: “Mira Calix has managed to wrest not blood, but music from a stone, putting the music into rock and creating a new cultural attraction”. Other public artworks appeared everywhere from a public bus in Nanjing, China, to the Tower of London. She also collaborated with opera and theatre companies, including Opera North and the Royal Shakespeare Company, writing scores for productions of Julius Caesar and Coriolanus for the latter. 2003 work Nunu featured the sound of live insects on stage, while Inside There Falls, a 2015 collaboration with Sydney Dance Company, used hidden speakers worn by dancers in a mobile, four-dimensional piece. She once said of her boldly experimental yet populist approach, in response to elderly listeners who loved one of her installations: “The whole piece was completely abstract, but it made them feel something. They didn’t say, this is too weird ... people like fantasy. We know this. But people also like fairytales. And they like abstractions. Art isn’t just for arseholes. People can handle it.” BBC 6 Music DJ Mary Anne Hobbs was among those paying tribute to Calix, calling her “such an ingenious, pioneering artist … always questioning, always pushing.” The musician Gazelle Twin said: “So so gut wrenching to hear this news of such an amazing, inspirational and unanimously loved creator.”",Arts/Music,"Mira Calix, adventurous electronic musician and sound artist, dies",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/28/mira-calix-adventurous-electronic-musician-and-sound-artist-dies
3/29/2022,"Hundreds of unidentified mammals are hiding in plain sight waiting to be discovered, according to a new study which predicts where to find so-called “cryptic” species across the tree of life. African elephants, lemurs and two newly discovered see-through frogs in Ecuador that live just 13 miles apart are among a growing number of plants and animals that have been unmasked by genetic analysis in recent years, revealing they are not a single species but, in fact, many and separate groups, despite appearing similar to the human eye. Thanks to the discoveries driven by the rise of DNA barcoding, a technique that can identify and differentiate between flora and fauna by their genetic divergence, scientists say our planet may be more biologically diverse than previously thought, meaning there could be many more species than the current best estimate of 8.7 million. Now researchers have gone a step further and proposed a new method to predict where to look for new animal species on the web of life amid fears that many are becoming extinct before they are known to science. By analysing millions of mammal gene sequences and other information on their environment and habitat, researchers say hundreds of bats, rodents, shrews and moles are waiting to be found, likely incorrectly classified as another species due to their size and physical appearance. While that finding would not surprise many biologists, researchers say the new predictive model could be used to help find undiscovered species in other animal groups, such as insects, a class in which millions of species are yet to be identified. “Based on our analysis, a conservative estimate would be that there are hundreds of species of mammals worldwide that have yet to be identified,” said Bryan Carstens, professor of evolution, ecology and organismal biology at Ohio State University, who co-authored the study, published on Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “What we did that was new was predict where these new species are most likely to be found,” Carstens said, adding that the model estimated that about 80% of mammal species had been discovered. “The shocking thing is that mammals are very well described compared to beetles or ants or other types of animals. That knowledge is important to people who are doing conservation work. We can’t protect a species if we don’t know that it exists. As soon as we name something as a species, that matters in a lot of legal and other ways,” said Carstens. The research, led by Ohio State graduate student Danielle Parsons, also predicted that cryptic mammal species are most likely to be those with wider geographic ranges with high precipitation and temperature variability. Examples include the little brown bat, found across North America, which was shown to be five separate species in 2018. The new DNA-based methods have caused a revolution in modern taxonomy, which, used in combination with traditional techniques first developed by Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, is helping scientists reorganise the library of life on Earth. Researchers say taxonomists are unlikely to have to search far for species to unveil, with many specimens likely already in natural history collections at museums. Recent examples include the Popa langur in Myanmar, previously confused with another species, and a new Indian aloe plant.

3/29/2022,"The first index to track race representation across UK sport has led to 43% of national governing bodies being handed the lowest three available grades. A trio of England’s biggest sporting administrators – the Football Association, the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the Rugby Football Union – failed to even take part. The inaugural Race Representation Index, commissioned by the sport monitoring advisory panel via charity Sporting Equals, was motivated by the Black Lives Matter movement following the death of George Floyd. It aimed to provide a baseline on racial diversity across the sector, allowing progress to be tracked year on year, and was initially delivered to 52 national governing bodies on a voluntary basis. Two, the FA and the RFU, declined to participate. The final report, released on Monday, also indicates that the ECB along with the British Basketball Federation, British Swimming and Volleyball England did not even confirm receipt of the RRI paperwork. The deadline for replies had been extended from mid-December until 6 January. The ECB’s position is particularly notable given its November commitment to “a wide-ranging action plan to tackle racism and promote inclusion and diversity at all levels of the game” amid the fallout from allegations of racism at Yorkshire CCC. It is understood its non-involvement in the RRI was not deliberate and that it will be contacting Sporting Equals regarding future cooperation. The governing bodies who participated in the RRI saw scores delivered on basis of hiring practices at board, senior management, senior coaching and playing or athletic level before a final grade is produced. A similar approach is already used to track matters of equality in college and professional sport in the US. Ten out of 35 national governing bodies were awarded an A, B or C grade with 15 in the domain of D, E or F. Incomplete returns were received from British Rowing, England Golf, Badminton England and British Cycling. The three bodies to receive an overall A mark were England Handball, Basketball England and GB Taekwondo. An F was given to British Canoeing and Snowsport England. Ama Agbeze, who captained England’s netball team to Commonwealth Games gold in 2018, sits on the sport monitoring advisory panel. She said: “While there are successes which should be acknowledged and applauded for best practice there is, as a whole, a long way to go for sport before true racial equality will be felt and achieved.” The RFU did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. A spokesperson for the FA said: “The FA supports the objectives of the Race Representation Index and believes transparency is key to achieving positive change. We have published ethnicity and gender data for our general workforce, leadership team and the national coaching population each year since 2018, with targets and progress outlined within our equality, diversity and inclusion plan, A Game For All. “We also launched the Football Leadership Diversity Code in 2020, which measures recruitment across the FA, other footballing stakeholders including the Premier League and EFL, and club signatories. This aims to focus on what we currently see on the pitch being reflected off the pitch, with an initial focus on gender and ethnic diversity, and progress reported annually. As we are already providing clarity and transparency about our work in this area, we opted to not additionally take part in this survey.” Professor Kevin Hylton, a special adviser to the project, said: “The sport monitoring advisory panel and Sporting Equals feel that while the baseline has been established there is still much work needed from the UK sport sector before we can tangibly feel and see a more actively anti-racist and inclusive sector. “Through the work of the Race Representation Index the tracking of that journey will become transparent for all to see, in addition to allowing for best practice to be shared widely to allow for the cultivation of an inclusive approach to sport and physical activity.”",Sport/Sport,UK sport’s governing bodies fail to make grade in landmark race report,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/28/uk-sports-governing-bodies-fail-to-make-grade-in-landmark-race-report
3/29/2022,"Women’s rights campaigners and women who claimed they were sexually harassed and bullied by the actor Noel Clarke have responded with dismay to the Metropolitan police’s decision not to launch a formal criminal investigation into the allegations against him. The Met said on Friday that no further action would be taken against Clarke, who was accused of groping, harassment and bullying by 20 women in the Guardian in April 2021. Clarke has consistently denied the allegations, but subsequently apologised if his “actions have affected people in ways I did not intend or realise”. The Met said it would not launch a formal investigation “following a thorough assessment by specialist detectives”. A spokesperson said: “We have updated the complainants. If any further allegations related to those already assessed are reported, then it will be thoroughly considered.” A female actor who provided a statement to police in May 2021 to allege sexual misconduct at Clarke’s hands was dismayed by the Met’s decision. “This is a very disappointing outcome for the people who courageously came forward and anyone who had close dealings with Noel and witnessed his consistent abuse of power,” she said. Meriel Beale, who coordinated an open letter signed by 2,000 people calling for reform to the UK film and TV industry after the allegations were made against Clarke, expressed frustration at the Met’s decision. “We know that the film and TV industry has a big problem,” Beale said. “I’m still regularly approached by distressed people – mainly women – who are experiencing bullying, sexual harassment and abuse. The problem is now being talked about, but it isn’t going away. It takes a huge amount of bravery to speak up, and women are upset by the perception they are not being taken seriously or believed.” Jamie Klingler of Reclaim These Streets, which earlier this month won a high court case about the Met’s handling of a vigil for Sarah Everard, was similarly dispirited. “It’s upsetting but not surprising,” said Klingler. “Time and time again the Met fails the women of London. Once again, this cements the message that there is no point in [making complaints to the police], as they either don’t believe us or minimise the impact and claim that the standard for prosecution isn’t reached. When will enough really be enough? When will they believe women?” After the initial accusations emerged, Bafta withdrew Clarke’s award for outstanding British contribution to cinema, and Sky cancelled his police procedural drama, Bulletproof. Clarke has subsequently kept a low profile, although it is understood that he consented to be interviewed for a documentary about the allegations that is in early development for Channel 4. In a statement, the Met confirmed that it had received a third-party report related to allegations of sexual offences on 21 April 2021, eight days before the Guardian’s investigation was published. It is understood that this report came from an industry organisation, not an individual. “Following a thorough assessment by specialist detectives, it was determined the information would not meet the threshold for a criminal investigation,” said a Met spokesperson. However, it is understood that at least five individuals contacted the police after the Guardian’s investigation, in addition to the initial third-party report made on 21 April 2021. It appears unlikely that these reports will lead to charges, with the Met confirming that it is not currently aware of any criminal investigation into the allegations against Clarke. Davie Fairbanks, one of the five, who worked with Clarke on the film Legacy and was a shareholder in his since dissolved production company Unstoppable Entertainment Ltd, contacted the Met shortly after the Guardian’s investigation was published in April 2021. Fairbanks alleges that he did not hear back from the Met after providing his statement. “I can’t imagine what these women are thinking today,” said Fairbanks. “These women need to be heard, and that hasn’t happened.” The Met did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of Fairbank’s claims.",Arts/Culture,Women’s rights activists dismayed by Met refusal to investigate Noel Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/28/womens-rights-activists-dismayed-by-met-refusal-to-investigate-noel-clarke
3/29/2022,"Nadhim Zahawi is a minister with a reputation for getting things done, thanks in large part to his involvement in the rollout of the Covid vaccine programme. But the education secretary’s long-awaited schools white paper, published on Monday after months of speculation, left many in the sector feeling underwhelmed. After exams mayhem and mishaps overseen by Zahawi’s predecessor, Gavin Williamson, and damage done by the pandemic, hopes were high for Zahawi’s first big outing, but immediate reaction to the 60-page white paper setting out the government’s vision for schools for the next eight years was muted. “Inoffensive,” said one commentator. “I’d give it a C-minus, or a GCSE grade 4,” said another. “It’s a pass, but not a good one.” Not much to object to, little to inspire, and inadequate funding to achieve any of its stated ambitions. The document, entitled “Opportunity for all: strong schools with great teachers for your child”, did include at least one key measure that could significantly change the education landscape. The single most impactful announcement was the promise that all schools in England would either be in a multi-academy trust or in the process of joining one by 2030, with a single regulatory approach. Six years ago, Nicky Morgan was forced to do an embarrassing U-turn on a similar pledge as education secretary after backbench Conservative rebels rejected the idea of already high-performing schools being forced to become academies. While most of the 3,500 secondary schools in England are now already academies, the great majority of the 16,800 primaries in the sector are not, with only 44% of mainstream schools in England having made the switch. “There is some logic to all schools becoming academies,” said one commentator. “We know the current system is fragmented. It’s logical to bring schools under the same regulatory framework.” Critics, however, warn that joining an academy trust does not necessarily lead to higher attainment and that making all schools academies will be fraught with difficulties. Zahawi has sweetened the pill by offering local authorities with successful schools the chance to set up their own multiple-academy trusts. Faced with government pressure to academise, it remains to be seen whether schools, unions and local communities still have the energy for a fight. Otherwise, the white paper covers familiar territory – the new and widely welcomed national register for children not in school, the use of data to modernise and improve tracking of attendance, the £30,000 starting salary for teachers, plus more and better teacher training. The requirement for all schools to offer a minimum school week of 32.5 hours will have limited impact because most schools already do so, and the “parent pledge” that a school will provide evidence-based support if your child falls behind in English and maths and keep you informed of their progress has been dismissed as a gimmick. On attainment, the government had already set a target in its levelling paper for 90% of children to leave primary school with the expected standard in reading, writing and maths, up from 65% currently. To this, the white paper added a companion ambition, to increase the national GCSE average grade in both English language and maths from 4.5 in 2019 to 5 by 2030. Both will be challenging to achieve against a backdrop of pandemic learning loss, continuing Covid disruption and a funding squeeze started by the government’s austerity policies, now exacerbated by rising inflation.",News/Education,Zahawi’s English schools white paper leaves many in sector underwhelmed,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/28/zahawis-english-schools-white-paper-leaves-many-in-sector-underwhelmed
3/29/2022,"Paul Collingwood has been around the block long enough to know international cricket is a results game but is equally amazed that Joe Root’s position as England captain is being questioned given his impact in the dressing room. The tour of the Caribbean was intended to be a fresh start for the Test team after the Ashes debacle but a galling 1-0 defeat to West Indies – sealed by a 10-wicket blowout in Grenada – means England have failed to win their past five series and led to widespread calls for Root to step down. Collingwood understands this reaction on one level and accepts that the Test team, sitting in last position in the World Test Championship, has possibly “bottomed out” during this winless winter. But, as the interim head coach for the month-long trip, he believes Root’s input behind the scenes is not being taken into account and will begin to bear fruit if patience is shown. “Sometimes it amazes me that he gets questioned, because of how it feels within the dressing room,” Collingwood said. “It’s the first time I’ve experienced him as a head coach and you can see the passion, the drive. There’s a hunger to get it right. These aren’t just words coming out of his mouth. “He’s desperate to get the team back to winning. I can’t say anything but positivity in terms of what he’s done leadership-wise. You have to understand how it feels in the dressing room and how strong a leader he is. He has the full backing from all the players and the management as well. It feels like he is still very much our No 1 to take this team forward.” Root’s apparent determination to plough on means the new managing director of the men’s team – likely to be appointed towards the end of April, with Marcus North, Rob Key and Mark Nicholas in the running – will have to make a call, in conjunction with the head coach they hire. There is, however, a lack of alternatives beyond Ben Stokes, a vice-captain who is already burdened by his dual role as an all-rounder and needed time out of the game last summer to address his mental health. To this end, Collingwood tried to develop a more collaborative approach on the Caribbean tour to “grow these boys into leaders”, but stressed this was not a soft environment either. The 45-year-old’s diagnosis for the loss was a case of a “monumental effort” trying to force wins during the first two Tests, only to then “break” on the third morning of the decider in Grenada. Joshua da Silva’s unbeaten century scrambled minds in the middle – including Root’s, it must be said – and England were then bowled out for a meagre 120 by the medium-pace of Kyle Mayers. Collingwood said: “The frustration about not being able to take those last two wickets quickly on the third morning filtered into the batting in the afternoon. Our decision-making wasn’t good enough. It’s something we’ve got to improve upon in pressure situations. We realise that. “We said when we came on this tour that we weren’t going to be the finished article. But we want to get the right attitude and the right things in the dressing room to progress the team. I think we’ve done a hell of a lot of good things, which is why it’s even more gutting not to get the result in the end.” Collingwood also remained unrepentant about the decision to leave Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad at home, claiming a player such Saqib Mahmood would not have got his chance had they been selected. Though debatable, given the back-to-back nature of the series was likely to require a degree of rotation, Mahmood certainly impressed with his skills and composure. Ollie Robinson, however, failed to get on the park after an early back spasm on tour led to concerns he might repeat his most recent outing in Hobart and break down mid-Test match. A return to Sussex, with a goal of getting in prime physical shape for the three-Test series against New Zealand, the world champions, in June, is now the plan. Collingwood’s own future is uncertain given the leadership vacuum in English cricket, something that goes right to the top with the role of ECB chair still vacant. Still technically an assistant coach in the set-up, this month-long project, though unsuccessful, has whetted his appetite. “It’s stressful,” he said. “You wake up so many times in the night. But it’s very rewarding, I promise you. I can imagine if you start winning and turn the corner, the satisfaction you’d get from that would be incredible. “It was always my challenge to leave this team in a better place than when I first got it and I feel as though it’s a lot stronger now. I’ve thrown my hat into the ring [for head coach] and if they want us, they know where I am.”",Sport/Sport,Paul Collingwood ‘amazed’ by questioning of Joe Root’s captaincy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/28/paul-collingwood-amazed-by-questioning-of-joe-roots-captaincy
3/29/2022,"A man stabbed a neighbour in a Gloucestershire village 27 times the day after telling a police officer: “I will murder him”, a jury has been told. Can Arslan, 52, killed father-of-three Matthew Boorman and seriously wounded his wife, Sarah Boorman, as she tried to fight him off, before forcing his way into the home of another neighbour, Peter Marsden, and knifing him eight times. Bristol crown court heard there had been a “long-running” dispute between Arslan and his neighbours, with small rows over parking and a scratch to a car, escalating to the point where Arslan faced eviction and repeatedly threatened to attack or kill those living near him. Five months before the attacks, which took place in October last year, Sarah Boorman had made a statement to police setting out the threats they had received from the defendant. She said they were worried about being murdered, or that someone was going to be seriously hurt very soon. Arslan made counter-allegations, accusing the Boormans of racially abusing him. The day before the attack, a police officer had telephoned Arslan about the complaint he had made and the defendant had told him he would murder Boorman. Arslan has admitted causing grievous bodily harm to Sarah Boorman, who suffered a deep knife wound to her thigh, and the attempted murder of Marsden and affray, but denies murder. On the first day of his trial, Kate Brunner QC, prosecuting, told the jury there was no dispute that Arslan had killed Boorman, 43, telling them what they must decide was whether it was murder or manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She said there was long-running dispute between Arslan and his neighbours in the village of Walton Cardiff, near Tewkesbury, resulting in them trying to get him evicted. Boorman had just parked outside his house at about 5.20pm on 5 October after returning from work, and was still on a conference call when Arslan stabbed him. Colleagues on the conference call heard Boorman shout: “What the fuck are you doing?” and Arslan replying: “Fucking want it?” in a “goading” tone. Brunner said: “The defendant appeared calm, smiling as if he was amused by what he was doing.” After leaving Boorman dead or dying on his front lawn, Arslan forced his way into Marsden’s kitchen, where he was sitting with his wife. Marsden managed to grapple Arslan out of the property and lock the door, although he sustained eight serious knife wounds. A psychiatric assessment found that Arslan was alert and had no psychotic symptoms, the prosecution claims, but the court was told the defence would argue he was in the grip of a psychiatric disorder.
