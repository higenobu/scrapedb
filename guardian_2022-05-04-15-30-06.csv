5/4/2022,"In 1895, the German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen noticed that a phosphor-coated screen gave off a green light when exposed to a cathode ray tube. He quickly realised that he’d found a new invisible ray. Asked what he thought when he saw this green light, he replied: “I didn’t think. I investigated.” In fact he spent seven weeks investigating, locked away in his laboratory and only coming out when his wife, Anna, insisted he eat something. He rewarded her concern for his wellbeing by using the unknown rays to make an image of her hand on a photographic plate. It proved that they could travel through skin and flesh: the plate revealed her bones and wedding ring. When she saw the image, she was appalled, saying: “I have seen my death!” In his notebook, Röntgen used a letter to denote the unknown rays: “X-rays”. As Sheehy says, this is “possibly the best unintentional branding in the history of physics”. Within a year of his discovery, X-rays were being used to find shrapnel in soldiers’ bodies on the battlefield. The question of how cathode ray tubes emitted X-rays led to the seminal discovery in 1897 of the electron – the first subatomic particle. Atoms were no longer regarded as the smallest indivisible entity in nature. Indeed, the next century would reveal a whole catalogue of particles, utterly transforming our understanding of matter. The key question for Australian physicist Suzie Sheehy is this: “What is matter, and how does it interact to create everything around us – including ourselves?” She describes her work, in which she tries to answer this question by studying the tiniest constituents in nature and the forces that govern them, as “one of the most awe-inspiring, intricate and creative adventures that humans have ever embarked on”. Her specialism is accelerator physics, a field that deploys some of the largest machines ever invented to manipulate matter on a tiny scale. An esoteric field, you might think, one that has little relevance to our everyday lives. But as she shows, particle physics has changed how we live dramatically over the last century. Your nearest hospital almost certainly has a particle accelerator, your smartphone relies on quantum mechanics, and Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web to help scientists share the vast amounts of data produced by particle experiments. Sheehy is not a theoretician, a modern-day Einstein creating speculative hypothesis about the nature of reality. Rather she is an experimental physicist who designs equipment that pushes the limits of current technology and generates new data and questions. It’s demanding work that requires curiosity, passion and tenacity. In her book – which is often complex yet never less than fascinating – she uses 12 experiments to show how particle physics has shaped our understanding of the world we live in. She begins with Röntgen’s discovery, before moving on to early experiments showing that the atom was composed mostly of empty space, with a dense nucleus surrounded by electrons, and on to the creation of the first particle accelerators in the 1930s. After the success of the top-secret Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb during the second world war, physicists embraced a large-scale, collaborative approach. This was the beginning of Big Science. Gone were the days of lone researchers, like Röntgen, toiling away in their laboratories – physics was now about gigantic, expensive machines, designed by groups of experimental scientists, maintained by specialist engineers, and operated by a dedicated staff. Results were interpreted by teams of scholars around the world. These methods yielded a deluge of new particles, from pions to positrons. The quest culminates – for now at least – with the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, a 27-km circular proton collider, 100 metres below ground near Geneva. It took two and a half decades to build, overseen by the Welsh physicist Lyndon Evans, affectionately known as “Evans the Atom”. Sheehy, who has worked at CERN, guides the reader round this triumph of engineering and scientific cooperation, “one of the greatest experiments ever built”. Described as the biggest machine on Earth, it is so sensitive that it has to be corrected for unbelievably small effects, such as the movement of the Earth’s crust due to the sun and the moon, or the passing of high speed trains – anything that will disturb the proton orbit. A proton is a million million times smaller than a grain of sand. The LHC “delivers two beams of hundreds of billions of protons to 99.999999 percent of the speed of light, focuses them down to less than the width of a hair, and then collides them”. Its task was to detect a single and very elusive particle – the Higgs boson, predicted in 1964. This goal was achieved in 2012, thanks to the collaboration of half of the world’s 13,000 particle physicists, and drawing on the resources of 110 countries. In the end, as Sheehy tells us, physics is not just about the search for how the Universe works: “Physics is all about people.” Her journey through the history of particle physics reveals the extraordinary ingenuity of experimental scientists and their selfless dedication to answering big questions about matter and the universe. It is a field that has brought huge benefits to humankind, from new medical imaging technologies to cancer treatments. But in the end, it may well be the physicists’ example of working together to solve problems that will prove the most valuable to us all, at a time when the world faces unparalleled challenges.

5/4/2022,"Movies about mediocre artists almost never get made, for the obvious reason that history has rightfully forgotten about them. It’s a delicious indignity, for example, that the great Oscar-winning adaptation of Peter Shaffer’s play about the obscure Italian composer Antonio Salieri is called Amadeus, after the musical savant whose genius far eclipsed him. Sometimes generational fame is a matter of timing or ineffable charisma, as the Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis implied about its hero, a never-was folk musician. (It seems no coincidence that the man who played Salieri, F Murray Abraham, delivers the devastating news that he “doesn’t see any money” in the singer’s work.) But in the real world, such stories are written constantly, since so few have the goods to realize their dreams of greatness. The superb Indian drama The Disciple, picked up and released last year on Netflix, offers the rarest of rare portraits of artistic mediocrities, because it’s not about that precious window of fame that’s usually sparked in youth. It’s not even about the pursuit of fame at all per se, at least beyond the narrow slice of connoisseurs who appreciate the rigors of traditional Indian classical music. For Sharad (Aditya Neruikar), a passionate young musician who’s learning at the feet (and sometimes massaging those feet) of Guruji (Arun Dravid), a master vocalist, patience is a necessary virtue. After one disappointing performance, Sharad is told that singers can’t be expected to find their voice until they’re 40. At that point in the film, he’s 16 years away. As the title suggests, The Disciple isn’t about a typical mentor-mentee relationship, but more about extreme devotion, which brings it as much in line with films about the acetic demands of the priesthood as films about musicians. Mumbai writer-director Chaitanya Tamhane (Court) opens with a shot of Guruji singing on stage before slowly pushing past him to focus on Sharad behind him on sitar, looking utterly enraptured by the performance. Though Sharad will face many humblings and crises of faith later, Tamhane connects to his genuine passion for classical vocals, and the way they undulate gracefully and intuitively around simple instrumentation. He knows that fortune doesn’t follow – the ageing Guruji relies on him for treatments and the odd medical bill – but transcendence might. Yet Tamhane hits on a brutal yet universal truth: that you can work hard to pursue your dreams and simply not have the talent to achieve them. No one is booing Sharad out of the building, but there are murmurs and tepid applause, and events where other singers get the nod over him. In one particularly humiliating moment, Guruji leans back toward him mid-performance to criticize his backing vocals. Meanwhile, he watches another classically trained singer hit it big on India’s American Idol equivalent by fusing traditional raga with broader pop sounds – which he regards as terrible desecration of the form while also seething with jealousy. The signature sequences in The Disciple are these beautiful slow-motion shots of Sharad driving his motorcycle through the streets of Mumbai at night, remembering key passages from a scratchy old record about how to train as a classical singer. They remind him that his quest is an eternal one, not suited to a person who wants to make money or start a family – “Though music,” he recalls, “we are shown a path to the divine.” But Tamhane includes scenes of his hero as an older and heavier and no more accomplished man, playing to small, half-filled rooms where an elderly crowd is scattered around on plastic chairs. Whatever “the divine” looks like, this ain’t it. Yet as sobering as Sharad’s journey often is, The Disciple isn’t about wallowing in failure, but about a man who’s forced to consider a different pathway for personal growth. A career in Indian classical music is a hard road even for the most resounding success, but even if it were lucrative, Sharad has to square up to a truth that nearly everyone faces: that there’s going to be someone – likely many someones – better than you at the thing you love doing the most. And it may be cosmically unfair if it comes as naturally to them as it does to the preening, childish maestro in Amadeus. What happens next is where a person’s character is really tested. In Tamhane’s profound, complicated drama, life lessons don’t come easy.

5/4/2022,"Following the bombshell release of a draft decision showing a majority of US supreme court justices may overturn Roe v Wade, legal experts believe other laws about individual autonomy may be in danger, including the right to access contraception. Laws broadly banning abortion may also prohibit certain forms of birth control that opponents incorrectly say are working as abortion-causing medications. And the supreme court decision underpinning the right to access contraception, Griswold v Connecticut, could also come under fire in much the same way as Roe did. “If this [draft] opinion becomes the opinion of the court, Griswold is imperiled – no question,” said Wendy Parmet, faculty co-director for the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University. Justice Samuel Alito, in his draft decision, argues that Roe is a faulty law. Roe is based on the 14th amendment, as are decisions like Obergefell v Hodges on same-sex marriage, Loving v Virginia on interracial marriage, and Lawrence v Texas on consensual sex. “The opinion doesn’t read like Roe was a wrongful tangent of the foundation” within the 14th Amendment, Parmet said. “It really reads like the foundation was inappropriate and unfounded. So judges are going to find it hard to make the distinction with contraception.” While Alito expressly states that similar laws are safe because they are not about “moral” issues as he says abortion is, there’s no reason the same logic couldn’t be applied to other legal decisions, experts say. “If the draft becomes the real opinion, all of those issues – contraception, consensual sex and marriage rights – certainly are all at risk,” said Priscilla Smith, lecturer on law and reproductive justice at Yale Law School. “They have definitely left the door wide open.” The right to abortion is not explicit in the constitution, Alito argues in the draft. (That’s partly because at the time of the framing, abortion was legal in the US before “quickening,” when the movements of a fetus are first felt.) Similarly, contraception is not mentioned specifically in the constitution, so strict interpretations of rights could exclude it. “There are a lot of decisions that follow from the idea of a constitutional right to privacy,” Parmet said. “Once you throw down the best-known decision in that category of cases, every single other case is now up for grabs.” The right to access contraception may not be challenged on its own, but it could be taken up under strict abortion laws – both new laws being introduced as well as older state laws on the books prior to Roe. Anti-abortion advocates have argued incorrectly that certain birth control methods, such as Plan B and certain intrauterine devices (IUDs), work as abortifacients because they may prevent the implantation of fertilized eggs. But there is no pregnancy without implantation, so these medications cannot terminate pregnancies. Even so, it’s “definitely possible” that some states may criminally prosecute people who provide contraception that they claim are abortifacients, Smith said, “because there are definitely states that would like to ban abortion from the moment of conception, which means before fertilization, before pregnancy”. Some states could take these measures further to ban other forms of contraceptives. “There’s definitely going to be a huge push by the anti-abortion world to take this as far as they can,” Smith said. “There is a whole wing of this group that is opposed to abortion who only support sexual intercourse when it is within the context of marriage and when it is designed to procreate. The use of contraception gets in the way of that.” Nationally, anti-abortion advocates are “setting the stage not just for a reversal of protections for abortion, but also for protection for the right to fetal life – the fetus being a person with a right to life guaranteed under the constitution,” Smith said. “That’s where we’re going if things don’t change.”",News/US news,Contraception could come under fire next after Roe v Wade is overturned,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/roe-v-wade-birth-control
5/4/2022,"It seems I have a screw loose – which is extremely annoying, because I spent the bulk of my weekend screwing. I recently moved into a bigger place, you see, and have had to buy furniture. I’m far too cheap to pay someone competent to put the stuff together (all furniture – at least the stuff I can afford – appears to come in 1,000 little pieces), so I have been attempting to do it myself. My wife helped with the weekend assembly efforts, I should add; this wasn’t a solo endeavour. But we are very bad lesbians. According to a YouGov survey, 77% of queer women in the US said they could build flatpack furniture, compared with 58% of heterosexual men and 48% of straight women. I am part of the terrible 23%, though. As I have written before, my dire DIY skills mean I’m an embarrassment to lesbians everywhere. Nevertheless, I persisted. I grabbed an Allen key and valiantly went to work on a table, chairs and about 2,000 screws. The finished products are worryingly wonky, but the process was a learning experience. I have discovered there are five stages of furniture-assembly grief. One, denial: this seems tricky, but I’m sure I can do it. I probably don’t even need to follow these incomprehensible illustrations. I will just follow my gut. Two, anger: what the hell is wrong with my gut? What the hell is wrong with this furniture? Three, bargaining: OK, calm down. You can do this. Stop thinking about it as work and start thinking about it as a fun game of Lego. Four, depression: I hate everything, especially Lego. Five, acceptance: well, the legs are wobbly and I’m not sure why I have three leftover bolts, but it’s fine. I can sit on it. Sort of. You know what else I learned? The Ikea effect – the idea that you place greater value on things you have made yourself – is nonsense. Or, perhaps, more accurately, NÖANSÖNSE.

5/4/2022,"An unprecedented leak of a draft supreme court decision shows a majority of justices support ending federal protections for abortions in arguably the most controversial court case in generations. While the draft could still change, if it is not substantially altered it would result in 26 states immediately or as soon as practicable banning abortion, a sea change in the American legal and political landscape. If the draft decision remains substantially unchanged, it would return the issue of abortion to the states, 26 states stand poised to ban or greatly restrict it. Until the court issues a final decision, the right to abortion is protected under federal law. That right was established in the landmark 1973 case Roe v Wade. Roe found pregnant people have a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy up to the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, roughly considered 24 weeks gestation, and a legal principle called “viability”. The court’s finding in Roe invalidated dozens of state abortion bans, and made it illegal for states to outlaw abortion before viability. The case that was the subject of the leak on Monday, called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, considered a Mississippi law that banned abortion at 15 weeks. Even though this is not a total ban, it strikes at the heart of the holding that established a federal right to abortion. A recent poll found 70% of Americans think abortion is a choice that should be left to a woman and her doctor, and polling over time has shown support for legal abortion has changed little since Roe v Wade was decided. Only a small minority think abortion should be completely illegal. The federal right to abortion hangs on a supreme court decision because, in the nearly 50 years since Roe v Wade was decided, congressional leaders failed to protect the right in statute. While there are Democrat-led efforts to protect abortion, they are stalled in the Senate. That’s because any new statute would need 60 votes to pass, and the 100-member Senate is evenly split. Democrats broadly support abortion rights, while Republicans almost universally oppose efforts to protect abortion rights. Some Democrats have proposed ending the 60-vote rule, called the filibuster, to move legislation on abortion and other key items on Joe Biden agenda’s forward. The president has endorsed such a change. However, two key Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, oppose such a change. It is unclear how the leaked opinion may change their position. Sinema has said she supports abortion rights, while Manchin has issued conflicting messages. Biden has called on Americans to elect more members of Congress who support reproductive rights in the upcoming midterm elections in November. If the issue of abortion were to return to the states, 26 would immediately or as soon as practicable ban abortion. States would do so through a mix of abortion bans that were invalidated by Roe v Wade but remained on the books, abortion bans “triggered” if Roe is overturned, and laws that limit the gestational age at which a person can terminate a pregnancy. All will probably be the subject of court challenges. For example, an abortion ban enacted in 1931 could go back into effect in Michigan. There, the Republican-led legislature supports the ban, but the state’s Democratic governor is challenging it in state court. In Arkansas, the state legislature has enacted a “trigger” ban. There, the state attorney general would need to certify the central holding of Roe was indeed struck down. The attorney general, a Republican, would likely seek to do so quickly. Trigger bans vary from state to state. While Arkansas requires an attorney general certification, Wyoming requires the governor to certify Roe has been overturned before the law goes into effect five days later. Other bans, once blocked by the courts because of Roe, could also go into effect. Enforcement of a six-week abortion ban in Iowa could go into effect. Because that is just two weeks after a pregnant person might miss a period, and before most people know they are pregnant, it is effectively a near-total ban. In all cases, laws will probably be challenged by reproductive rights groups, and it will take time for cases to move through state and perhaps federal courts. Some experts have estimated it could take between six months to two years for most cases to be settled. What is certain is in that time, Republican-led states would probably seek to push the envelope in terms of criminalizing abortion, and seek to enforce the bans they already have on the books. Making abortion illegal will not stop abortions. People who live in states where abortion is outlawed but want to terminate a pregnancy may seek to travel to states where it remains legal, or obtain medication to end a pregnancy. Medication abortion can safely end pregnancies up to 10 weeks gestation using a two-pill protocol. However, in states where abortion is illegal, those pills would need to be obtained illicitly, perhaps through through the mail. Patients who want to go to clinics, or whose pregnancy is too far along to be self-managed with medication, would need to travel potentially hundreds of miles to states where abortion is legal. That may be an impossible hurdle for women whose finances are strained or who cannot find childcare. People who live in states where abortion remains legal would also be impacted, because they would face longer wait times for appointments as patients flood into clinics from out-of-state. This could create a secondary wave of travel. Even more broadly, outlawing abortion would substantially undermine care for basic obstetric procedures, such as miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies, in a country which already has among the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world. Nearly half (44%) of all future obstetricians and gynecologists are trained in states that would outlaw abortion, making it impossible to train all new doctors in the skills needed to manage induced or spontaneous abortion. Even more doctors may be frightened to provide evidence-based care to women who face life-threatening complications, if their condition is not imminently emergent – but may become so. Some Democrat-led states, such as Oregon, are working to protect abortion by providing funds for people who travel to their states to obtain abortions. Others, such as California, are working to build capacity for the thousands of woman who could suddenly find the nearest abortion clinic there. But in all cases, these efforts will be incomplete. Not all people will be able to travel or obtain medication abortions, and may forced to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term.",News/US news,How soon could US states outlaw abortions if Roe v Wade is overturned?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/04/us-supreme-court-abortion-explainer
5/4/2022,"At just over 35 miles, the Gotthard base tunnel is the world’s longest railway tunnel. When it opened in 2016, there was speculation as to the fate of the old Gotthard railway through the Swiss Alps. It’s a steeply graded, sinuous line; it skirts Lake Lucerne and then cuts under the St Gotthard Massif to reach the Ticino valley which drains south towards Italy. Thankfully, the decision of Swiss rail operator Südostbahn (SOB) to step in with a new train service on the legacy line has breathed fresh life into a classic rail route. The first trains from Basel via the old Gotthard line, right through to Locarno, ran in April 2021. It’s a perfect north-south connection through the Alps, and one especially well suited to travellers from the UK; Basel is the most accessible Swiss city by train, taking just seven hours from London with an easy change of train in Paris or, on some services, Paris and Strasbourg. Basel is by the railway, although the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, who spent many childhood years in and around the city, remarked that when it came to railways his home town was a place of multiple personalities. In Jung’s day there was the Swiss station (now known as Basel SBB), the German station and the French station. It’s still much the same, although the French station is really little more than a down-at-heel annex of the Swiss station. That section for French trains is often referred to simply as the Westflügel (West Wing). SOB’s copper-hued Treno Gottardo to Locarno waits at Platform 6 at Basel SBB. This is no grand intercity train, but a modest Interregio linking key Swiss regions, with many stops along the way. For the Treno Gottardo that means 20 stops on the 4½-hour journey to Locarno. There are faster routes from Basel to the Ticino region – the sleek high-speed trains dash through the new Gotthard base tunnel – but who wants to miss the Alpine scenery by travelling through a very long tunnel? We slip out of Basel, swapping densely settled suburbs at Liestal for the forested hills around the Homburger valley and then dive into the Hauenstein tunnel. Emerging into the sunshine, the Treno Gottardo makes a theatrical loop, crossing the River Aare to reach the first stop at Olten. From here it is a short hop south to Lucerne, but it’s a moment to note the great design which underpins the appeal of the Treno Gottardo. SOB’s introduction of stylish Stadler Traverso trains in the past few years has brought real flair to this new route. Creative seating arrangements, generous space and large panorama windows make these Traverso trains perfect for a gentle rail cruise through the Alps. Few travellers make the full 180-mile journey from end to end. This is a train which is used mainly for journeys between communities along the route: Olten, Lucerne, Bellinzona, and villages in the upper part of the Ticino valley which rely on the Treno Gottardo as their main public transport link with the wider world. It is the mix of travellers which gives character to journeys on the Treno Gottardo. Two hours into the journey, we have slipped by the Rigi massif, passed the Lauerzersee and are cruising along the east shore of the Urner See – the utterly beautiful southernmost limb of Lake Lucerne. Across the water there is a fine view of the meadows at Rütli, where representatives of Switzerland’s three founding cantons allegedly met to swear an oath of allegiance. On the far side of the lake a rocky plinth bears an inscription acknowledging Friedrich Schiller as the Bard of Tell. Schiller’s Wilhelm Tell and Rossini’s opera on the same theme sealed this uppermost part of Lake Lucerne as the cradle of Swiss identity. The entire Gotthard railway, which was completed in 1882, was central to Swiss nation-building. This bold route through the High Alps underpinned Switzerland’s claim to being a natural mediator at the heart of Europe. By the mid-1880s, Switzerland was dubbed Gotthard Nation. The illustrious guidebook publisher Baedeker praised the Gotthard railway as “one of the grandest achievements of modern engineering.” And that demonstration of engineering prowess became central to Swiss self-understanding as a progressive, modern nation. Beyond Flüelen, at the end of the Urnersee, the train climbs up the Reuss valley, performing neat pirouettes through circular tunnels, along the way affording three different perspectives on the handsome Roman Catholic church at Wassen. Göschenen, at the northern portal of the original Gotthard tunnel, makes a good stop for a couple of hours. At the station there is an exhibition on the Gotthard route, and it’s an easy walk into the village, which has an unkempt charm. Beyond the tunnel at Göschenen – happily, at nine miles, much shorter than the new Base tunnel – the Treno Gottardo descends through short spiral loops into the vineyards and chestnut groves of the Ticino valley. This panoramic journey along the classic Gotthard line is neck-craning stuff, chasing the views as the train twists and turns. But peak spotting isn’t obligatory and, having travelled the route many times, I often now just sit back and let the landscape evolve. This route is pure cinema. And it’s a good deal more comfortable these days than in the pre-railway era; when the Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk crossed the Gotthard in an ox cart in the early 15th century, he was so terrified that he travelled blindfolded. The journey ends at Locarno on the shores of Lake Maggiore. You may want to hop straight back on the train for the return run, but elegant Locarno warrants a couple of days. From here, my favourite route south into Italy is with the seasonal boat service down Lake Maggiore to the Borromean Islands and Stresa, from where there’s a good train service to Milan. Travel notesThe Treno Gottardo leaves Basel every two hours for Locarno. For a few weeks in the early summer, engineering work will necessitate a change of train at Olten, about 30 minutes into the journey. The fully flexible one-way fare from Basel to Locarno is 84 Swiss francs (£69). Cheaper restricted fares (no stopovers) from £25. The full range of flexible and discounted tickets can be booked online at sbb.ch (for the best fares in Swiss francs), or book at raileurope.com (sterling fares available, but note there’s a £6.95 booking fee). If part of a longer rail tour, an Interrail pass is the best option and offers maximum flexibility. Prices start at £155 (€185) for a four-day pass, allaboard.eu. There is also the Swiss rail pass with unlimited travel on buses, funiculars, free access to museums and boat travel as well as trains (£229 for four days).

5/4/2022,"Last May, 12 of us used Booking.com to rent a Greek villa for a fortnight in August. We paid the €4,435 cost in full and booked flights and hire cars. Recently Booking.com informed us that there had been a pricing error and the actual cost was €9,407. We were told that we must pay the difference or it would cancel the reservation. It is already re-advertising the villa for the dates we have booked. We feel that it is trying to take advantage of increasing demand for holidays at our expense.PJ, Stockport Booking.com holds customers to strict terms and conditions when it comes to cancellations, but scuppers holidays itself without penalty. Last year, I reported on a family who arrived for their spa holiday in Cornwall to find the company had transferred their booking to the London suburb of Uxbridge. Your experience is similarly breathtaking in its audacity. The curt email from Booking.com arrived 11 months after your booking and gave you 24 hours to pay the extra. It stated that the villa owner wished to find “middle ground” and would reduce the new €9,400 price by €200. It added, graciously, that if you did not want to accept the offer it would cancel your booking “for free”. The company’s terms and conditions state that obvious errors, such as a €1 hotel suite, are not binding. If the €4,435 price was an “obvious error”, you’d expect the owner to have noticed last year. If it were not, you should have been able to rely on another clause in the terms and conditions which state that your payment constitutes “final settlement of the due and payable service”. In the event, Booking.com cancelled and refunded your reservation while you were still discussing what to do. You and your family have now been left nearly €3,000 out of pocket after paying for alternative accommodation and rearranging flights and car hire. I repeatedly asked Booking.com whether owners were required to sign cancellation terms so that customers could be confident that they would get what they paid for. It said evasively that it works “collaboratively” with owners who are responsible for pricing and availability and that it supports customers when errors occur. “We can see that in this instance it was an error on the part of the villa and are investigating why this occurred to make sure it does not happen again,” it said. Scandalously, the story would have ended there if you hadn’t asked me to investigate. Only then did the company agree to refund the €2,930 costs of rearranging the holiday. Booking.com’s terms and conditions state that it handles all complaints internally and is not obliged to submit to alternative dispute resolution providers so, had it refused to compensate, your next step would have been a claim for your expenses via the small claims court.

5/4/2022,"Qantas will go to the high court in a last-ditch attempt to avoid paying a mammoth compensation bill to almost 1,700 sacked ground handlers for years of lost work, after the airline failed to overturn a ruling that it illegally outsourced the jobs. On Wednesday, the full bench of the federal court on Wednesday dismissed Qantas’s appeal of a July 2021 ruling that the airline had acted against protections in the Fair Work Act when it terminated about 1,680 jobs at 10 airports amid the pandemic in November 2020. In the earlier case the federal court had ruled Qantas’s outsourcing of the workers was in part driven by a desire to avoid industrial action. Qantas had claimed the outsourcing was a necessary financial measure that could save it $100m annually and reduce future spending on ground handling equipment like tugs and baggage loaders. The Transport Workers Union had argued the outsourcing decision was motivated by an anti-union sentiment. Many of those sacked were union members and their bargaining agreement was set to expire the following month. The legal saga has grown in complexity in the months after the 2021 ruling. Qantas appealed it, while remedy hearings have also taken place between the airline and the TWU, which brought the initial court challenge over the outsourcing decision. The remedy hearings previously ruled out ordering Qantas to offer the workers their jobs back, in part because of the third-party agreements the airline had since entered into. The TWU appealed this decision, pushing for reinstatement to be reconsidered. The full bench of the federal court also considered this but it was dismissed in Wednesday’s ruling by justices Mordy Bromberg, Darryl Rangiah and Robert Bromwich. The legal saga will now return to the remedy hearings, where justice Michael Lee will decide on the compensation for affected workers and financial penalties against Qantas. But Qantas will now ask that the remedy hearings be paused as it is seeking to appeal Wednesday’s judgment in the high court. “Today’s judgment does not mean Qantas is required to pay compensation or penalties,” the airline said in a statement. “Qantas has always said the decision to outsource our ground handling function was based on lawful commercial reasons in response to the unprecedented impact of the Covid crisis.” Michael Kaine, the national secretary of the TWU, said Wednesday’s ruling reaffirmed what was “the largest finding by a country mile of illegal sacking and outsourcing in Australian corporate history”. He also called Qantas’s decision to take the matter to the high court “reprehensible”. “In the face of four federal court judges saying that they acted illegally, instead of showing contrition … they’ve said no, let’s fight our workforce in the high court,” Kaine said. Kaine would not speculate on what he believed Qantas’s compensation bill could be, but said he wanted the airline to return to the remedy hearings and sit with workers and the union to discuss an “appropriate amount of compensation … for their lost wages, past and future, and compensate them for their pain and suffering”. Outside the federal court in Sydney, Graham McKay, a former Qantas ground handler, said he had been forced to sell his house in Sydney and move his family outside the city as he had been unable to find work after his job was terminated. “This is a bittersweet moment … a lot of us have had a lot of losses,” McKay said. Kaine called on the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to contact the Qantas board and request the airline’s chief executive, Alan Joyce, and chief executive of domestic and international operations, Andrew David, be sacked. The TWU have accused the Morrison government of failing to hold Qantas to account after the airline received received about $2bn in government Covid wage supports. “Safety, service and sentiment for the airline have all plummeted over this unlawful decision to outsource,” Kaine said. “There is only one appropriate response from the Qantas board – heads must roll.”",News/Business,Qantas vows to go to high court after losing appeal over unlawful baggage handler sackings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/qantas-vows-to-go-to-high-court-after-losing-appeal-over-unlawful-baggage-handler-sackings
5/4/2022,"A case has been filed against the government of Sierra Leone to overturn the country’s loitering laws, which activists and lawyers claim are discriminatory, and used by police to extract bribes from people and sexually abuse women. The laws are used to target poor and vulnerable people, say critics, and to subject them to criminal sanctions for potential conduct rather than actual harm caused. Women arrested for loitering, and lacking money to pay bribes, have claimed they have been violently raped by police officers. Others say they have been coerced into having sex to avoid spending the night in a police cell. Loitering has been on the statute books since the days of British rule and is punishable by up to a month’s imprisonment. It is a petty offence that is defined in the Public Order Act of 1965 and the Summary Conviction Offences Ordinance of 1906. Section 7 of the Public Order Act 1965 states that any person “loitering in or about any stable house or building, or … in the open air, and not having any visible means of subsistence, and not giving a good account of himself, shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person … and be liable to imprisonment for any period, not exceeding one month”. Oludayo Fagbemi, senior legal officer at the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA), said that the laws discriminate against people on the grounds of social status: “In lots of cases, it is poor people who get caught. People who sell things to club-goers, people who have to work late and walk home at night – they are arrested just because they are on the street.” The case, filed at the Ecowas court of justice in Nigeria on 21 April and brought jointly by the IHRDA and AdvocAid, a civil society organisation working with girls and women caught up in Sierra Leone’s legal system, alleges that the laws violate provisions under the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights, such as the right to equality and non-discrimination and the right to freedom of movement. “This case is about the state’s violation of the rights to freedom of movement, equality, and non-discrimination of poor Sierra Leoneans through laws that criminalise petty offences,” said Eleanor Thompson, a lawyer working on the case. “It is truly about the criminalisation of poverty because the anti-loitering laws are used disproportionately against the poor and marginalised.” The government and police did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Global development,Bid to overturn Sierra Leone loitering laws that activists claim ‘criminalise poverty’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/04/bid-to-overturn-sierra-leone-loitering-laws-that-activists-claim-criminalise-poverty
