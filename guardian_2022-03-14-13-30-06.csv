3/14/2022,"The Fox News primetime host Tucker Carlson has been widely accused of echoing Russian propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine. According to a report on Sunday, earlier this month the Putin regime in Moscow sent out an instruction to friendly media outlets: use more clips of Carlson. Mother Jones, a progressive magazine, said it had obtained memos produced by the Russian Department of Information and Telecommunications Support. One document, it said, was entitled “For Media and Commentators (recommendations for coverage of events as of 03.03)”, or 3 March. The magazine published pictures of the memo, which it said it was given by “a contributor to a national Russian media outlet who asked not to be identified”. It said the memo included an instruction: “It is essential to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who sharply criticises the actions of the United States [and] Nato, their negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine, [and] the defiantly provocative behavior from the leadership of the eastern countries and Nato towards the Russian Federation and towards President Putin, personally.” The document, Mother Jones said, summed up Carlson’s position on the Ukraine war as “Russia is only protecting its interests and security” and included a quote: “And how would the US behave if such a situation developed in neighbouring Mexico or Canada?” Carlson and Fox News did not comment to Mother Jones. Fox News did not respond to a Guardian request for comment. On air last Wednesday, 9 March, Carlson said testimony by Victoria Nuland, a US undersecretary of state, about Ukrainian “biological research facilities” had shown Russian claims of US involvement were “totally and completely true”. Fact checkers said they were not. “Russian state TV featured Carlson’s take the next day,” the Washington Post said, adding that the Russian claim about US participation in biological laboratories in Ukraine was “straight out of the old Soviet playbook. But that doesn’t mean prominent commentators like Carlson should be so quick to fall for it”. Citing another Russian “recommendations for coverage” memo, dated 10 March, Mother Jones said the text advised Russian hosts to relay the message that “activities of military biological laboratories with American participation on the territory of Ukraine carried global threats to Russia and Europe”. On Sunday Joe Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told NBC Russian claims about biological warfare facilities in Ukraine could indicate Russian willingness to use such weapons. “When Russia starts accusing other countries of potentially doing something, it’s a good tell that they may be on the cusp of doing it themselves,” he said. Mother Jones said no other western journalist was named in the memos it obtained, which it said also included advice on how to cite Carlson about how “Biden’s sanctions policy” was actually an economic “punishment for the American middle class”. That memo, the magazine said, also cited the New York Post, like Fox News owned by Rupert Murdoch. On Sunday afternoon, Julia Davis, an analyst of Russian media, tweeted a still from “Russia’s state TV” showing “none other than Tucker Carlson” on a screen above a discussion panel. “They always follow the Kremlin’s directives,” Davis wrote, “namely to use Tuckyo Rose clips as often as possible.” “Tokyo Rose” was a nickname given by Americans to several women who broadcast Japanese propaganda during the second world war.",News/Media,Kremlin memos urged Russian media to use Tucker Carlson clips – report,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/14/kremlin-memos-russian-media-tucker-carlson-fox-news-mother-jones
3/14/2022,"Grace Tame doesn’t think she would be alive today if not for her fiance, Max Heerey. “I always like to be two steps ahead,” she told a packed theatre on the weekend, revealing she had been admitted to hospital with suicidal thoughts in the week prior to the festival. “Or, in the case of the Daily Mail, eight years ahead.” “I actually lost control and I was really scared,” Tame continued. “I called up the clinic and I said ‘I can’t, I can’t, I steeped too deep into the shame spiral and I’m thinking about killing myself.’” Such are the pressures on Tame and other trauma survivors who obtain a public platform. Their activism is born from necessity, and is necessarily tied up in pain and hurt. But their successes are also wrapped up in the same painful memories. “It’s a great privilege to be heard and one that very few people get,” Tame said. But the relentless weight of the press has taken its toll: “The media has a lot to answer for as to where it directs its shame. It should be directed at perpetrators of abuse, not survivors.” Her fellow panellist Rosie Batty has also not escaped media attention. The day after her 11-year-old son was murdered by his father, a shell-shocked Batty swiped away her friends to powerfully address journalists with: “Nothing can hurt me now.” But Batty said being interrogated by the media at a time when she had barely begun to process her grief had prevented her from facing it. “If it makes people uncomfortable to sit with real feelings, well – tough shit,” she said, amid tears. “Am I relieved I’m alive or disappointed I’m still here?” Batty said in response to Tame’s revelation, reflecting on a particularly dark period in her own life. “I want to live – I have to live,” she said. “That bastard who took Luke can’t take my life.” CC What is it to be a woman in the world? What is it to survive, to be a “survivor” of trauma? The All About Women opening night gala was a testament to the power of vulnerability, a thread which wound throughout the evening and the panels to come. The artist, lawyer and advocate Amani Haydar reread the victim impact statement she wrote after her father murdered her mother and before she channelled her rage into acclaimed memoir The Mother Wound. And Joelle Taylor read her TS Eliot prize-winning poem C+nto, a call for arms for any woman who has been belittled or abused, roaring to the crowd: “There are landmines buried deep beneath your skin, and no one understands them.” The night served a reminder that the female body is, and will always be, political. These women’s bodies – and that of their mothers, friends, lovers – have been belittled, objectified, abused, murdered and judged. But what if these women forced the world to look at the landmines beneath their skin? At the conclusion of the show, the poet Tishani Doshi read from her poem, Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods. She was powerful, beautiful; sensual, yet not sexualised, as her words rose in a crescendo: “Girls are coming outof the woods the way birds arriveat morning windows – peckingand humming,until all you can hearis the smash of their minuscule heartsagainst glass,the bright desperationof sound – bashing, disappearing.” CC In 2021, the then-attorney general Christian Porter named himself as the person at the centre of an ABC report on a historic rape allegation. He has consistently denied that he assaulted a 16-year-old girl in 1988, when he was 17. His accuser, only known as Kate, killed herself in 2020 after withdrawing her complaint to the police and the investigation was discontinued. In the aftermath, her friends, including the theatre director Jo Dyer, advocated on her behalf for further investigation. Porter later settled a defamation case against the ABC, with the broadcaster publishing a statement that it did not intend to suggest Porter was guilty. As the situation now stands, Porter has resigned, following controversy about his declaration of a “blind trust” as the source of his legal fees for the defamation case, and the story has been a lightning rod in the nation’s culture wars. And like the reporting of the story itself, the panellists – Dyer, Kate’s lawyer Michael Bradley, and the journalist Samantha Maiden – had to tread carefully, making clear at the outset that Kate’s allegations were just that. Chaired by Julia Baird, the panel debated the question: in the case of sexual assault allegations, is our legal system fit for purpose? “The criminal justice system runs this clear line – he is innocent until proven guilty, beyond reasonable doubt,” said Bradley. “And throughout he can maintain his right to silence. What this does systemically is it puts the complainant in the frame as the sole witness as to what’s happened. And she’s coming from a starting point of not being believed. She has to constantly tell her story. Why would any volunteer subject themselves to that?” The disincentive for making a rape complaint, particularly an historic one, is strong, he added. “The criminal justice system was not designed for rape cases.” Dyer said that she believed that there should have been an independent inquiry into the allegations against Porter – “and whatever the outcome had been, we would have been satisfied.” BD More than 20 years after Aileen Moreton-Robinson’s seminal analysis on the whiteness of Australian feminism, Talkin’ Up to the White Woman, was first published, all that has changed for Indigenous people, she says now, is they have been further wrapped up in the state. Appearing alongside Chelsea Watego, Amy McQuire and Larissa Behrendt, Moreton-Robinson gave a frank assessment of the continued ripples of colonial violence against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women in Australia, wrapped up in the illusion of progress. In 1986, the first taskforce report into Indigenous women’s business in Australia was released. 35 years later, the human rights commission released a similar report, virtually mimicking the recommendations of the 1980s. “Only two things were different,” Moreton-Robinson said. “Climate change, and youth suicide. The fundamental change that’s happened is we have been further incorporated into the state’s orbit … and the bureaucratisation of Indigenous service deliveries has hindered our opposition.” Moreton-Robinson said it was hard to feel optimistic about the future – but asked what she hoped for, looking forward, as the nation grapples with another Aboriginal death in custody, she replied: “See, I find that hard to answer. The past is in front of you, the future is behind you.” We live with the past, we know how slowly change has been made. The future is unknown. Amy McGuire agreed: “Dealing with death on the daily,” she said, “it’s hard to think of a future at times … when we are denied it. We are deemed destined to die.” CC The gender binary is deeply intertwined with other systems of oppression, such as colonisation. The academic and Wiradjuri trans/non-binary person Sandy O’Sullivan told the audience, “The colonial project is all about putting everyone into boxes, but people have been outside the gender binary for eons.” Amao Leota Lu, who is Samoan fa’afafine and a trans woman, as well as a performance artist and activist, agreed. “It can be problematic going into western settings because there’s the expectation that we are one or two genders rather than three, four or five, or anything in between. In the west I seem to be stuck in a world that seems to challenge my own indigenous identity.” Everyone suffers in a binary world, including cisgender people, said the writer Jinghua Qian. “Cis people still suffer under this binary. How many cis women have discomfort with womanhood because it does have so many social constraints? The way the gender binary is enforced affects everyone.” As the moderator, academic and author Yves Rees observed, “fluidity keeps things simple. Why do we have to complicate things with binaries?” BD Like the other sessions I attended, there was a strong message of needing to confront colonisation in concert with fighting for women’s rights. But while we are fighting the good fight, we should not forget to love. I’ve seen the US writer Roxane Gay speak on a number of occasions. While she is consistently brilliant, I have never seen her so happy and relaxed as she was on stage on Sunday night at the Sydney Opera House. She got married during the pandemic (to the designer Debbie Millman) and has found the relationship to be transformative. “Everyone in my family has noticed I’ve changed and I’m more patient and I’m happier … and part of it is that I feel loved. If someone tells you you’re beautiful often enough – you think ‘OK – maybe I’ve got something going on here …’ Sometimes you need validation – especially when it’s coming from a place of real love. It makes you walk with a bit more of a strut.” Gay told the story of how they met, which almost didn’t happen, because she felt too overcommitted to go on Millman’s design podcast. But Millman persisted and friends intervened to encourage the meeting. Before their first datehad ended, they were planning a second. “On the sidewalk, she asked if she could kiss me. No one’s ever asked me that before!” said Gay. “Debbie came along at the right time … you get tired of chasing, waiting for someone to love you enough to stop chasing them – to have that space where you feel increasingly confident.” And from that place of love and confidence, Gay’s work continues.

3/14/2022,"Queensland’s integrity commissioner has told the state parliament she was called “a bitch on a witch-hunt” by the chief executive of the Public Service Commission during a phone conversation in 2018. The integrity commissioner, Dr Nikola Stepanov, announced her resignation in January, sparking a much-hyped integrity saga within the Queensland public service. Stepanov – whose office regulates lobbying in Queensland – has previously raised concerns about interference with her office by the Public Service Commission (PSC), which controls her agency’s budget and staffing. Those concerns include allegations the PSC removed and wiped the contents of a laptop used by an employee, and complaints that the PSC had gradually stripped resources and key staff from the integrity commissioner’s office. The state parliament’s economic and governance committee is holding hearings about a strategic review of the integrity commissioner’s office. Stepanov gave evidence on Monday morning. She said she had written to the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and would remain in her role until at least 31 December – extending her tenure in order to oversee reforms. Stepanov named the PSC chief executive, Robert Setter, as the “senior public servant” referred to in a media report who had described her as a “bitch on a witch-hunt”. Asked whether she had ever been called such a term and “subject to misogynistic language”, Stepanov replied: “I do confirm that I have had comments of that nature … said to me. “I support a modern public service where women and men, particularly those emerging as leaders, are not subject to those kinds of gender-based slurs. “I was called that term by the PSC chief executive. I had already heard it, but I was called that term by him in a phone call on or about 4 April 2018.” Setter has previously denied suggestions he was uncooperative with Stepanov’s attempts to conduct a lobbying audit of the PSC. The integrity commissioner is an independent statutory office whose responsibility is to advise MPs and public servants on ethics matters, and to regulate lobbying activities. The PSC is a central government agency assisting departments with managing their workforce. Stepanov reiterated her support for a potential commission of inquiry into the integrity matters and argued that the integrity commissioner’s office should be separated from the PSC. She said she should ultimately be given control of her own office’s staffing and budget. “Where I have encountered concerns about conduct, the staff within the office are PSC staff,” she told the committee. “You are seeking to do your job in an environment where you don’t, in effect, control the resources that support you.” Stepanov had previously raised concerns about the way a PSC staff member, who had been working in her office, had handled confidential documents. She requested a forensic examination of the employee’s laptop. In March 2021, the PSC removed and allegedly wiped the contents of a laptop. The Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission is investigating a complaint related to the deletion of files from the laptop.",News/Australia news,Committee hears agency head made ‘slur’ against integrity commissioner Nikola Stepanov,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/bitch-on-a-witch-hunt-committee-hears-agency-head-made-slur-against-integrity-commissioner-nikola-stepanov
