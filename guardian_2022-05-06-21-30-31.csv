Fortunately their chances of staying third until the season’s end are boosted by facing Wolves.

5/6/2022,"The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers called the health and social care committee’s plan for NHS litigation reform “completely unacceptable” because it would deprive vulnerable patients of full and fair compensation and then expect a woefully ill-equipped social care and benefits system to look after them (When the NHS spends billions on personal injury cases, it’s the public that loses, 3 May). The solution to the patient safety crisis – and it is a crisis – is in appointing a patient safety commissioner with a wide remit of providing strategic coordination and an overarching link between patients, regulators, healthcare providers and policymakers. The current patchwork quilt of well-meaning but disparate initiatives is not good enough. We know this for a fact because the NHS’s own figures show that in 10 years the number of patient safety incidents resulting in severe harm or death has gone up, not down. This situation needs clear leadership and a coherent strategy, leading to a culture of openness and accountability where lessons are learned without removing the responsibility to provide full and fair redress to injured patients.Mike BennerChief executive, Association of Personal Injury Lawyers",News/Society,Injured NHS patients need full and fair redress | Letter,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/06/injured-nhs-patients-need-full-and-fair-redress
5/6/2022,"The Liverpool supporters’ union Spirit of Shankly has accused Uefa of hypocrisy for condemning the greed of Super League clubs while increasing its ticket revenue by 38% over the past four years. Liverpool and Real Madrid have been allocated 19,618 tickets each for the final in Paris, priced at £50.32, £125.79, £410.91 and £578.63. The two cheapest category tickets – amounting to about 15,500 seats per club – were discounted at the request of the semi-finalists, after Uefa had proposed offering 5,000 free tickets to each finalist. There is no reduction for over-65s, young adults (17-21) or juniors. The finalists’ allocation amounts to 52.3% of the Stade de France capacity on 28 May, which has been reduced to 75,000. Another 12,000 tickets will be allocated via a public ballot and the remaining 23,764 given to the Uefa “family” and corporate sponsors. With tickets selling on resale sites for between £3,275 for one ballot ticket to £15,499 for a hospitality seat in a private suite, Spirit of Shankly has condemned Uefa, accusing it of fleecing fans and indulging sponsors. In an open letter to European football’s governing body, SOS wrote: “Since 2018 when LFC last played Real Madrid in the final, Uefa’s ticket revenue has gone from €3.06m to €4.22m, which equates to a 38% increase in four years. “In standing up to the failed Super League, Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said: ‘I can’t understand how you can see your fans protesting and you don’t care. You are full of money anyway, you’re not poor, but you want more and more and more.’ Well Mr Ceferin, Liverpool fans are protesting and you don’t seem to care. Uefa are not poor, but you seem to want more. And more. “Similarly, Uefa’s proposed changes to their club competitions in the future ignore the interests of the fans. Football supporters are tired of being ripped off. Tired of watching their team reach a final, but unable to find a ticket to attend. And tired of exorbitant prices.

5/6/2022,"Of everything in my wardrobe, the items that never, ever fail to win me compliments are my black stomper boots. Reassuringly solid black leather, with a round toe on a sturdy footbed, a zip at the front and a pull tab at the back. There is nothing remotely pretty about them, but they are a thing of beauty. Don’t take my word for it, though. Like I say, I can’t leave the house without someone – often a stranger, often very stylishly dressed, always female – admiring them. It was an adorable, designer-wardrobed assassin who made the stomper boot an It shoe. Before Villanelle wore Balenciaga boots with that pink Molly Goddard dress in the first series of Killing Eve, the stomper boot was deliberately, defiantly alt. It was skinheads and punks, goths and rockers. But Villanelle was a prime-time TV celebrity, and with her on board, the boot became a street-style hit. While school-run mums were still wearing vintage floral dresses with white Converse, Copenhagen fashion week influencers, makeup artists on shoots and cool girls in bands began wearing them with stompy boots. Some clothing functions as a secret code among women. The items must have attitude, presence and energy. They must be fun, but also practical. The stomper boot is in this category, but it is not alone. A jumpsuit is practically a tribal marking among women who don’t want to wear fussy clothes but don’t want to wear boring clothes. Wearing a jumpsuit to an office with a substantial female workforce will bring you almost as much love as arriving with a puppy. Dresses with pockets are also a way to recognise like-minded souls. “Great dress,” says woman A. “Thanks! I love it because it has pockets,” says woman B. Comradeship in a few words. This talk of jumpsuits, pockets and boots – or interesting earrings, unusual scarves – is fired by solidarity, not competition: very different from cooing over a ballgown or huge diamond ring. It was by speaking in this code that I found my own beloved boots. Last autumn I was talking with Jo Sykes, the very chic creative director of Jigsaw, and admiring her elegant but heavy-duty boots. She told me they were the brand’s Sawyer Trek Boots. I copied her and have been wearing them ever since (as I write they are still available, marked down, in most sizes). Ganni does a much-loved stomper in a leather-and-rubber, Chelsea-boot style. Dr Martens makes the iconic lace-up version, obviously, but Arket’s are also excellent. Atterley, a very handy online platform where you can shop from more than 300 of the kind of independent boutiques you would love to support but probably don’t have time to visit, recently put together an edit that included Stella McCartney, Pinko and Vagabond. The most desirable have an exaggerated lug sole, slightly larger than the boot, so the footprint is supersized. They go with everything. With jeans, roll the hem so that it sits at the top of the boot; with blowsy trousers, tuck the hem into the boot to keep the shape neat at the ankle. With a pouffy dress, add socks in a contrasting colour. (Push the socks down so that they scrunch.) They are too heavy to wear as walking boots, but for urban marching, they are heaven. And if you can’t find them in the shops, ask the next woman you see wearing a nice pair where she got hers. You won’t be the first, believe me.

5/6/2022,"The 57-year old patient who survived two months after undergoing a landmark pig heart transplant died of a pig virus, his transplant surgeon announced last month. In January, David Bennett, a handyman who suffered from heart failure, underwent a highly experimental surgery at the University of Maryland medical center in which doctors transplanted a genetically modified pig’s heart into him. Shortly after undergoing the surgery, Bennett died in March. The hospital simply said his condition had worsened over the span of a few days but did not provide an exact cause of death. Last month, Bennett’s transplant surgeon Bartley Griffith, revealed that the pig’s heart was infected with porcine virus known as porcine cytomegalovirus, which may have contributed to Bennett’s death. In a webinar hosted by the American Society of Transplantation on 20 April, Griffith described the virus and doctors’ attempts to treat it, MIT Technology Review first reported on Wednesday. “We are beginning to learn why he passed on,” said Griffith, adding, “[the virus] maybe was the actor, or could be the actor, that set this whole thing off.” According to experts, the transplant was a “major test of xenotransplantation,” a process that involves transferring tissues between multiple species. They believe that the experiment may have been derailed as a result of an “unforced error”, as the pigs that were bred to provide organs are supposed to be free of viruses. “If this was an infection, we can likely prevent it in the future,” Griffith said during the webinar. The biggest challenge in animal-to-human organ transplants is the resilience of the human immune system, as it can attack foreign cells in a process called rejection and trigger a response that will ultimately destroy the transplanted organ or tissue. As a result, companies have been biologically engineering pigs by removing and adding various genes to help conceal their tissues from potential immune attacks. The heart used in Bennett’s case came from a pig that underwent 10 gene modifications carried out by Revivicor, a biotechnology company. Despite worries that xenotransplantation could trigger a pandemic if a virus were to adapt within a human body and spread to others, experts believe that the specific type of virus in Bennett’s donor heart is not capable of infecting human cells. According to Jay Fishman, a specialist in transplant infections at Massachusetts General Hospital, there is “no real risk to humans” of it spreading to others. Rather, the concern stems from the ability of porcine cytomegalovirus to trigger reactions that can damage and destroy not only the organ, but also the patient. Experts are hesitant to fully attribute Bennett’s death to the virus. According to Joachim Denner, a researcher at Free University of Berlin’s Institute of Virology, “This patient was very, very, very ill. Do not forget that… Maybe the virus contributed but it was not the sole reason.” Two years ago, Denner led a study in which researchers reported that pig hearts transplanted into baboons lasted only several weeks if they contained porcine cytomegalovirus. On the other hand, hearts that were free of the infection were able to survive over six months. Shortly after Bennett’s surgery, Griffith and his team had frequently monitored his recovery through various blood tests. In one of the tests, doctors examined Bennett’s blood for traces of various viruses and bacterias and found “a little blip” that indicated the presence of porcine cytomegalovirus. However, because its levels were so low, the doctors assumed that the result could have been an error. Griffith also revealed that because the special blood test was taking approximately 10 days to carry out, doctors were unable to know that the virus was already beginning to multiply rapidly. As a result, this may have triggered a reaction that Griffith now believes was likely “cytokine explosion,” a storm of exaggerated immune response that can cause serious issues. On the 43rd day of the experiment, doctors discovered that Bennett was breathing hard and warm to the touch. “He looked really funky. Something happened to him. He looked infected,” said Griffith, adding, “He lost his attention and wouldn’t talk to us.” In attempts to fight Bennett’s infection while keeping Bennett’s immune system under control, doctors provided Bennett with intravenous immunoglobulin as well as cidofovir, a drug sometimes used in Aids patients. Bennett displayed signs of recovery after 24 hours before his condition worsened again. “I personally suspect he developed a capillary leak in response to his inflammatory explosion, and that filled his heart with edema, the edema turned into fibrotic tissue, and he went into severe and unreversing diastolic heart failure,” Griffith said in the webinar.",News/US news,"Man who received landmark pig heart transplant died of pig virus, surgeon says",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/06/man-landmark-pig-heart-transplant-death-pig-virus
5/6/2022,"Gordon Ramsay has sold one of his homes in Cornwall for £7.5m in what is believed to be the most expensive sale ever recorded in the county. Daymer Bay House in Trebetherick – a property with six bedrooms, four bathrooms, a swimming pool and tennis court set on a hectare (2.5 acres) of land – was sold in March last year, when the pandemic-fuelled “race for space” was still driving up house prices in picturesque and more rural locations. The celebrity chef, who has a net worth estimated at $220m (£178m), has made a tidy profit from the sale, having paid £4.4m for it in 2016. He now has one property left in Cornwall. The sale was the most expensive in Cornwall last year, according to Land Registry documents. It is also believed to be the most expensive ever sold in Cornwall, supplanting Polwartha in Rock which went for £6.5m in 2007, according to Cornwall Live. Ramsay has appeared outside the property on a segment of ITV’s breakfast show This Morning, with his daughter Matilda, when the family spent time there during the first lockdown in 2020. After once owning three homes in Cornwall, including a Grade II-listed former Lloyds Bank in Fowey, he now just has his waterfront house in Rock. The house in Rock was built on the site of a now demolished five-bedroom home, which he acquired for £4.4m in 2015. In March, Ramsay was criticised for saying he did not like the local residents, some of whom have complained about his renovation plans in the past, but “absolutely loves” the county. “Trust me, I absolutely love Cornwall, it’s just the Cornish I can’t stand,” he told Vernon Kay, the stand-in host on Zoë Ball’s BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show. When further asked about the remark he added: “I promise I did mean it.” A spokesperson for Ramsay subsequently said the Hell’s Kitchen star had “made these tongue-in-cheek comments many, many times”.",Lifestyle/Food,Gordon Ramsay sells Cornish home ‘for a record’ £7.5m,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/may/06/gordon-ramsay-sells-home-for-75m-in-apparent-record-for-cornwall

5/6/2022,"Conservative MPs have said Boris Johnson has “questions to answer” after a mixed set of local election results in which the Tories lost longheld London boroughs to Labour while Keir Starmer’s party made only modest gains outside the capital. With many results still to come – not least in Scotland, where Labour hope to show progress – the Liberal Democrats were celebrating a successful night, gaining 58 seats by 11am, including in West Oxfordshire where the Tories lost control of the council. The Conservatives had lost 122 seats with just over half the results for England declared, while Labour was up 35. Labour hailed its wins in Westminster, Wandsworth and Barnet, all longtime Conservative strongholds in the capital, as well as taking 30 of 46 seats on the new Cumberland council, and success in Southampton where it took control. Starmer said in Barnet that the results were a “big turning point” for his party. “From the depths of 2019, that general election, winning in the north, Cumberland, Southampton. We’ve changed Labour and now we’re seeing the results of that.” However, Labour failed to claw back much ground in many “red wall” areas outside the capital, measured against when these seats were last fought in 2018 during Theresa May’s premiership. The elections expert Prof John Curtice told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The trouble is, outside of London, Labour share of the vote was actually down slightly. In terms of seats won and lost, while it’s made net gains in London, it’s actually made a slight net loss outside of London. So outside of London it’s a rather different story. And of course Labour can’t win Westminster parliament by simply winning Westminster council.” Conservative MPs mulling a move against Johnson will be scrutinising the results closely. David Simmonds, the Tory MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, said: “Clearly the prime minister has difficult questions to answer. People were broadly positive about the government’s policies but they’re not happy with what they’ve been hearing about Partygate.” The Wimbledon MP Stephen Hammond, who saw the Lib Dems take council seats at the Conservatives’ expense in his local borough of Merton, said: “That ought to be a clarion bell ringing in Downing Street to make sure we are concentrating on the cost of living.” Asked about Johnson’s future, he told the BBC: “I think he has to prove his integrity to the country.” The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, went to Wimbledon to give a victory speech, calling the results “an almighty shock wave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down”. He pointed to his party’s success in overturning hefty Conservative majorities in byelections last year in Chesham and Amersham and then North Shropshire, saying: “It is the movement of millions of people who are saying loud and clear: ‘We have had enough.’ The tectonic plates of British politics are shifting beneath Boris Johnson’s feet. And now it’s time for Conservative MPs to plunge him into the abyss.” The Green party also had a good night, with the number of council seats it holds in England more than doubling to 39. Some of these are well outside the party’s traditional strongholds, in areas including South Tyneside and Cumberland. The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden dismissed calls for Johnson to consider his position as a result of the party’s losses, claiming the results were typical for a midterm government. “While there have been difficult results, they are consistent with what you’d expect with us from midterm,” he said. “Labour are certainly not on the path to power and I believe that Boris Johnson does have the leadership skills, in particular the energy and the dynamism, that we need during this difficult period of time.” The prime minister, who was visiting a school in his Uxbridge constituency, conceded that it had been a “tough night,” but highlighted his party’s stronger performance in some areas. “We had a tough night in some parts of the country but on the other hand in other parts of the country you are still seeing Conservatives going forward and making quite remarkable gains in places that haven’t voted Conservative for a long time, if ever,” he said. Labour dismissed the idea it was not making progress, pointing out that its vote share was up in key battleground seats when measured against its catastrophic performance at the 2019 general election. It said that on this basis it looked on course to win back up to 16 seats that voted leave in the EU referendum, including Carlisle, Great Grimsby and Workington. Many grassroots Tories laid the blame at Johnson’s door for the loss of their seats. John Mallinson, the Conservative leader of Carlisle city council, told the BBC he had “lost some very good colleagues” in the Cumberland local election, and had found it “difficult to drag the debate back to local issues” while campaigning, because of Partygate and the cost of living crisis. He said: “I think it is not just Partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don’t feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.” Asked if Conservative MPs should remove Johnson, he said: “That would be my preference, yes.” Campaigners from all parties said the cost of living came up frequently on the doorstep, and the results will increase the pressure on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to take fresh action to help families struggling to make ends meet. The Bank of England forecast on Thursday that inflation could hit 10% by the end of the year and the economy could slip into reverse in 2023.",News/Politics,Local elections: Tory MPs say Boris Johnson has questions to answer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/local-elections-tory-mps-say-boris-johnson-has-questions-to-answer
5/6/2022,"Symbols matter, so Labour’s victories in Westminster (wow!), Wandsworth (ha!) and Barnet (speaks to progress on antisemitism) give a fine fillip to the party’s fortunes. Wins in Cumberland and Southampton augur well. It’s too early in the day to know how close Labour is to becoming the biggest party at the next election, but the Liberal Democrat revival gnawing at Tory votes helps. Conservative councillors went over the top defenceless, lambs to the slaughter. But they deserve every loss, after tolerating intolerable 50% cuts to their council budgets without rebelling against their Westminster party. They blame their leader’s collapsed ratings and the cost of living crisis, but don’t pity Tories reaping their own whirlwind: their MPs and local parties cynically chose a rogue prime minister, knowing his egregious unfitness for office. Now he’s their loser, Tory ex-council leaders line up to call for his head. If final results suggest Brexit divides still lurk, especially in the north, the Tories may keep Johnson hoping he can rekindle old passions. Labour should hope they do, as his negatives far outweigh the dying embers of Brexit passions. However, fire in the belly is what the official opposition lacks right now: time to let the frontbench off their tight leash of disciplined messaging for more forthright speaking from the heart.  Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Faced with the results today, some Conservatives are saying all is well. This is wrong. Of course, these results are not a sign of a seismic Labour recovery, or a Blair-like storming to power for Keir Starmer. Though Labour made gains, they were not enough to win back areas like those they lost back in 2005 and 2010, like Nuneaton and Peterborough. But Labour does not need a Blair-sized victory to deprive the Conservatives of power: they can do so while being behind on votes, come a general election. The Conservative vote is in trouble on two fronts. Most stark is they have faced serious attrition in London and the south, especially in areas with more educated and middle-class voters: to go backwards by so much in these areas spells serious trouble for southern marginals at the next election. To simply write off a Labour advance with the middle classes as Starmer being a “metropolitan elite” – as one Tory source has – is to misunderstand the Conservative victory in 2019, where the party was able to carry southern seats as well as northern ones. And there are plenty of middle-class voters in the “red wall” too. Nor were the results good for the Conservatives in the red wall. Again, the key here is that change is on the 2018 council elections, not the 2019 general election. Labour standing still (as they did in Hartlepool), making gains (Dudley), or even going slightly backwards (Sandwell) is a good result for the party. Why? Because in 2018 they held the northern and Midlands seats that Boris Johnson went on to win a year later. Labour did as well in the red wall yesterday as they did when they last held the red wall. Today, some Conservatives – whether wilfully or not – are in denial about the scale of that problem, especially those most loyal to No 10. But since January, the interests of Boris Johnson and the Conservative party have become disconnected. If Conservatives want to win again at the next general election, they will need to come to that realisation – or risk sleepwalking into national defeat.  James Johnson is a former Downing Street pollster who worked under Theresa May and now runs JL Partners At the time of writing, Liberal Democrats across the country are jubilant. Gains have been made in traditionally Conservative and Labour areas in the capital, such as Merton and Brent, with astonishing wins in places such as Richmond and Kingston-upon-Hull. This follows on the heels of “blue wall” byelection wins in Chesham and Amersham and North Shropshire in 2021. More local election results are still to be announced, but we are delighted with the wins. It is usually foolhardy to directly equate local and national politics, but this time it felt different. Voters told me that they were worried about rising inflation, spiralling energy costs and, in the wake of Partygate, couldn’t help but feel that the Conservative cabinet was only looking out for itself. Councillors – current, new and former – have told me that cash is desperately needed from central government to do more for those most in need – but that local government is seen as a low national priority. I’ve noticed ethnic minority communities feeling let down by promises of a Brexit “dividend” that never transpired, and anecdotal evidence of particularly low voter turnout among these groups. It’s clear that the Liberal Democrats provided an alternative for many thousands across the country. Neither Boris Johnson nor Keir Starmer can claim an outright win today, despite reasonable results in parts of the country. This makes the next 12 months, in the runup to the next local elections and a rumoured general election, a critical time. Today’s results show us that people are looking for a new political home. Expect more upsets.  Amna Ahmad is vice-president of the Liberal Democrat party The political conditions for Labour could hardly be more fortuitous. We have a Tory government enveloped in a scandal over systematically breaking its own laws during a national emergency, riddled with sleaze, led by a man whose own admirers acknowledge is a stranger to honesty, and overseeing the worst squeeze in living standards in modern history. In midterm, too, voters were well-disposed to give the incumbents a kicking. First, Labour’s good news: the Tories have collapsed in London. Wandsworth, the laboratory of Thatcherism; Westminster, whose former leader Shirley Porter from the 1980s was best known for gerrymandering; and Barnet are now all red. A long-term trend must be acknowledged in a city with an increasingly young, diverse, working-class population defined by a housing crisis. But piling up votes in the capital is no compensation for going backwards in England. “Long Corbyn” is given as the reason by Labour politicians and commentators, a bizarre excuse for doing worse in English boroughs than Keir Starmer’s predecessor did in 2018. The Labour leader’s brazen discarding of his leadership pitch – radical policies fused with party unity – in favour of a vision-free offer and relentless punching left has not delivered the electoral goods. The rise of the Greens is just one sign that marginalised progressive voters were already looking elsewhere. Perhaps a cost-of-living crisis set to rob the pockets of millions is Starmer’s lifeboat, allowing him to win by default without offering any inspiring plan for the country he seeks to lead. Maybe, but Labour have bet the farm on a leader as devoid of principle as he is of charisma, mopping up purely because of Tory failure. It is clearly not enough.

5/6/2022,"Anew dawn has broken, has it not. But the difference between 1997, when Tony Blair famously greeted victory with these words, and the rather more anticlimactic muddle of this year’s local elections, is that this isn’t quite the dawn Labour was after. The good news for Keir Starmer is that there is a profound if very unpredictable realignment under way in British politics, with the ground starting to crack beneath the Tories’ feet in their southern strongholds much as it once did for Labour in their northern ones. If the next general election were 10 or even five years away, things would be looking very sunny indeed. As it is, Britain may well go to the polls while Labour is still in an awkward transitional stage, trying to make sense of a past seemingly dead and a future yet unborn. Not so much glad confident morning as one greeted half-dressed and hopping about, with one foot caught in your trousers. True, toast will have been dropped over Tory breakfast tables at news of Wandsworth and Westminster falling to Labour. There were breakthroughs, too, in places such as Cumberland – home to Workington Man, archetype for the 2019 red wall voter, and split between three Labour target seats – or Chingford on the border between London and Essex, part of Iain Duncan Smith’s seat. Labour canvassers in some parts of the south particularly are gleefully reporting the return of the “I’ve always been a Conservative, but …” voter, Tories who simply can’t condone the behaviour of their own party. (Even those who swallowed their doubts about illicit partying aren’t happy: 53% of those voting Conservative on Thursday thought their government hadn’t done enough to help with the cost of living, according to a TUC/Opinium poll that suggests something in the Treasury must surely now give.) Liberal remain-voting Tories, who have felt like a persecuted minority in their party ever since Brexit, are meanwhile starting to snap. The divide first noted in 2016, when older and less well-educated voters voted leave while younger ones and graduates voted remain, looks to be consolidating and cutting across tribal loyalties. In Chingford, Labour campaigners found City workers worried about their jobs now that Brexit is pushing banking business out to rival European cities, plus the kind of priced-out young urbanites now turning suburbs and shire towns into more favourable Labour territory. Like the three marginals overlapping in Barnet, where Labour recaptured the council, this is exactly the kind of seat that should fall under a “don’t frighten the horses” Starmer leadership. And if unhappy Tories aren’t always swinging directly to Labour – in rural west Oxfordshire, and most likely in parts of Surrey still counting at the time of writing, it’s the Liberal Democrats who have benefited from irritation with Johnson plus longer-term anger about new housebuilding – that’s not necessarily a problem for Starmer. Demolishing such a huge Tory majority requires a pincer movement by progressive parties, each attacking parts the other can’t reach. But while the Lib Dems seem to be delivering on their side of what isn’t quite yet a deal, Labour is lagging on its. With much of England, Scotland and Wales still yet to finish counting at the time of writing, there are glimmerings of recovery in so-called red wall seats but signs in some parts of 2019 Tory voters doubling down. Any spike in support for the Greens, small independent or local candidates – classic plague-on-all-your-houses votes – would suggest that disillusioned 2019 Tory voters won’t just meekly return to Labour overnight, but will try other options first. All of this adds up to a new and fiendishly complicated electoral picture, demanding new leaps of political imagination yet to emerge from Labour. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of Labour progress, meanwhile, remains its fragility. If Starmer is never going to set the heather alight, the great advantage of his decent-but-dull public persona is that mud doesn’t easily stick. Despite the news this week that Durham Police will investigate him for having a takeaway curry and a beer at the end of a day’s campaigning in Durham into a scandal, nobody looks at Starmer and sees a party animal. But as a test of Labour’s performance under pressure, Beergate was more worrying. A week of harrying saw Starmer looking sometimes reluctant to answer questions – probably because he doesn’t think they’re fair, but in an election they won’t be – and his office occasionally muddling details. An election campaign in which Tories genuinely feared for their survival would be this magnified a hundredfold, with every half-true rumour that could conceivably be dug up on any Labour candidate simultaneously upended over his head. To win under such a barrage, Labour will have to be slick, confident and miles out ahead from the off. So far what we’re looking at is a party that, even under conditions in which Boris Johnson was practically daring voters to kick him, has recovered from the near-fatal collapse it suffered at Jeremy Corbyn’s lowest ebb and perhaps progressed a little further than Corbyn at his highest ebb, but remains basically stuck in Ed Miliband territory: nearly there, but not quite nearly enough. A new dawn has broken, but something about the day doesn’t half look familiar.

5/6/2022,"It was described as the Mona Lisa of the digital world and it came with a connoisseur’s price tag: $2.9m (£2.4m) for the first tweet by Twitter’s co-founder. This was March 2021 and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, were bursting into the mainstream. One year on, an attempt to sell on Jack Dorsey’s Twitter debut for $25m was pulled after auction bids topped out at just $14,000 (£11,350). Explosive growth of NFTs over the past 12 months has levelled off, and may even be in decline, according to analysis of the sector, as attention consolidates around a few of the largest players. The NFT rush in 2021 saw sale after sale of the novel digital assets hit staggering sums. A collection of images by the visual artist Beeple sold for $69m, the main token for the “play to earn” video game Axie Infinity hit a total value of $9.75bn and Coca-Cola raised more than $575,000 from selling items such as a customised jacket to be worn in the metaverse. The football industry, with former Chelsea star John Terry to the fore, has not been slow to back the craze either. The Dorsey NFT was put up for auction in April by its owner, the cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sina Estavi, who said: “This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world.” Estavi hoped to raise more than $25m from the sale and offered to donate half his takings to charity. When bids reached just $14,000, he pulled the auction entirely. Non-fungible tokens are so-called because, unlike similar technologies such as bitcoin and ethereum, each is in some way unique. That means that they can be applied to more than just simple currency-style uses, and in the past few years NFTs have been adopted by people seeking to turn art, music, games and trading cards into digital assets. NFTs use a blockchain – the decentralised ledger first used by bitcoin to track ownership of the cryptocurrency – to record who owns them and allow them to be traded or modified. But most are based on the ethereum blockchain, which is maintained through an extremely carbon-intensive system called proof of work. A report published this week by Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm, said collectors have spent $37bn this year up to 1 May, putting them on track to beat the $40bn spent in 2021. However, it said that the “explosive” growth of the NFT market last year had “levelled off”, with a sharp dip in transactions since February. In other words, the monthly spend on NFTs is no longer rising in leaps and bounds, when it started to take off in the middle of last year. Chainalysis said transaction growth had come in “fits and starts” since last summer except for two big spikes: the release of Yuga Labs’ Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection in August 2021; and a surge in late January this year, likely to have been driven by the LooksRare NFT marketplace. Other beneficiaries of the boom have seen their value collapse during the past few months. Axie Infinity, for instance, was the flagship example of the “play to earn” sector in gaming. Players could spend thousands of dollars on a Pokémon-style virtual pet, and then play games to win tokens that could be traded for real cash. At its peak, the game redistributed enough money to in effect pay the wages of thousands of players in the Philippines, but as new players dried up, the value of its token – and the rewards – crashed, bringing the market cap of the organisation from $10bn in November to less than $2bn now. A $500m hack in March, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored attackers, has not helped. But some NFT projects have thrived. The most prominent, such as Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Social Club or Proof Collective’s Moonbirds, serve as signifiers of membership to an exclusive club of holders, and as the industry has consolidated around a few large players, interest in their releases has skyrocketed. When Yuga Labs released its most recent NFT, a set of 55,000 “otherdeeds” representing ownership of virtual land in a forthcoming videogame, the rush to buy the £5,000 tokens was so high that the ethereum blockchain was overwhelmed. Transaction fees shot up to more than £2,500 a trade, affecting not only those trying (and in some cases failing) to buy the otherdeeds, but also anyone else trying to use the ethereum blockchain at the same time. One unrelated trade saw a $25 NFT sold in a transaction that cost more than $3,000 to execute. Ethan McMahon, economist at Chainalysis said: “The ‘blue chip’ names like Bored Ape Yacht Club have more price stability than new entrants that may get hot and then fizzle out. I would only caveat this by saying that this isn’t new in this space: to date, a select group of popular collections have been the ones to receive the vast majority of activity and, generally speaking, most collections never take off.” The decentralised nature of the NFT market means there are even disputes about the nature of the crash at all. While specific NFTs have lost millions of dollars of value, the health of the industry as a whole depends on who you ask. Tom Schmidt, a cryptocurrency investor, cited data from OpenSea, an NFT marketplace, to argue that monthly sales were only slightly down from a peak in January, while a report from cryptocurrency analysts Kraken suggests that the daily transaction volume on Opensea peaked in September and has halved in the months since. Despite the digital Mona Lisa losing its lustre, NFTs remain a multibillion dollar market.",News/Technology,NFTs: the great rush may be over – but are they in actual decline?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/06/nfts-rush-decline-jack-dorsey-tweet
5/6/2022,"Sir Martin Sorrell has described the twice-delayed reporting of S4 Capital’s annual results as “unacceptable and embarrassing” and pledged to restore investor confidence in the advertising group after almost $1bn (£810m) was wiped off its market value. S4 Capital, the digitally-led ad group Sorrell launched after resigning from WPP four years ago, was forced to delay the publication of its results twice after its auditors, PwC, said it was “unable to complete the work necessary”. The delays stoked investor fears, and for Sorrell, a finance man driven to make a success of S4 Capital after his bitter departure from WPP, the accounting delays have been a blow that also wiped £90m from the value of his stake in the business. “Delay in producing our 2021 results is unacceptable and embarrassing,” he told investors and analysts in a presentation on Friday. Reasons cited for the delay include control weaknesses, staff turnover and lack of detailed documentation, “particularly relating to revenue and cost of sales recognition”. Sorrell said an “upskilling” of the finance team was in progress, with a number of senior hires already made, as the number-crunching side of the operation attempts to keep up with the blistering pace of growth of S4 Capital. “Significant changes in our financial control, risk and governance structure and resources at board, company and practice level are being implemented and planned to try to ensure this never happens again and we return to a normal financial calendar,” Sorrell said. “[A] full debrief [is] planned to ensure all suggestions from PwC are captured.” S4 Capital reported a doubling of revenues to £686m last year. However, the company swung to a pre-tax loss of £56.7m after incurring £136.9m in charges relating to acquisitions, amortisation and share based payments. The company’s share price rose 4% to 339p on Friday but remains well down on the high of 870p in September last year. “S4 Capital’s results are solid but unspectacular,” said Thomas Singlehurst, a media analyst at Citi. “Our call on S4C was … that the delay to results would likely be procedural and, in this context, the market was overstating risk. We think this is borne out by today’s results and would expect a gradual rerating as the market reengages with fundamentals.”",News/Media,‘Unacceptable and embarrassing’: Sorrell criticises S4 Capital results delay,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/06/unacceptable-and-embarrassing-sorrell-criticises-s4-capital-results-delay
5/6/2022,"Bristol’s Labour mayor has suffered a blow after the city voted to end the role. Marvin Rees, the first person of black African heritage to become a directly elected mayor in a major European city, will serve out his current term, after which Bristol will return to a committee system. Opposition politicians, who argued that the role invested too much power in one person, hailed the result of the referendum on the mayoral role as a chance to reset democracy in the city. However, Rees said he believed the committee was a “very poor system” that would not tackle critical issues as effectively as a prominent, visible leader. He said: “I hope I am wrong, because certainly the city faces challenges and the city needs a leadership that can lead it in the face of the challenges and opportunities.” During the campaign, he said issues ranging from the response to the pandemic to the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston benefited from the clear type of leadership that the role of a directly elected mayor enabled. Rees, who was re-elected in May last year and had already said he would not run for a third time, denied the vote was a judgment on his time in office and said the referendum had been a “distraction” from more important issues, such as the cost of living crisis. The referendum was held after Liberal Democrat councillors proposed a motion for the vote, seconded by the Greens, with 59% of people voting for the role to be scrapped, and a turnout of 29%. The councillor Heather Mack, the leader of the Green group, said it marked “a new chapter in the way our city is run”. “For many years now, important decisions affecting the city have been made behind closed doors by just one person whom the public and elected councillors cannot easily challenge,” she said. “We look forward to a fairer, more open way of doing business where decisions are made collaboratively.” At last year’s council elections, the Greens became the joint biggest party in Bristol with Labour, and the party hoped Rees would share power. However, to their anger and frustration, the Greens were given no seats in Rees’s cabinet. Rees will serve out his term until 2024, at which point all councillors will be up for re-election. It seems unlikely that any party will win an overall majority, opening up the possibility of a coalition, possibly between Labour and the Greens. While Rees is seen by many, nationally and internationally, as an impressive figure, he also has detractors in Bristol, with some annoyed at his style of management. There has been anger over plans for a new arena, resident parking zones and the MetroBus transport scheme, though Rees inherited the first two projects. Jos Clark, the leader of the Lib Dem council group, said she hoped for “more collaboration” under a “fairer system”. Mark Weston, the leader of the Conservative group, said: “The mayoral model has proven a disaster for Bristol – too much power at the whim of one individual.” The mayoral post was created in 2012, with the independent candidate George Ferguson becoming the first to occupy the role. Rees beat Ferguson in 2016.",News/UK news,Bristol votes to scrap directly elected mayoral role,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/bristol-votes-referendum-directly-elected-mayoral-role-marvin-rees
5/6/2022,"How to rewrite Rodgers and Hammerstein’s classic musical without changing a word? It turns out all you need do is make us really watch, and really listen. In immersing the audience in the action (with some spectators sat at stage-side tables) and highlighting tricky scenes and characters that are often hastily brushed over, directors Daniel Fish and Jordan Fein have created a modern, sexy and unsettling show. And as for the music? The score sounds so revitalised it might’ve been written yesterday. With the lights on full glare and the modern-dressed ensemble cast sat on stage throughout, there’s the livewire feeling of a read-through, as if the actors are approaching the book and music for the very first time. Nothing is sacred. Everything is up for grabs. The physicality and proximity of this production make us think about the show differently. During the big ensemble numbers, it’s possible to turn your head and tune into a different song line. It’s our choice, it seems, whom we listen to. At the end of the showpiece numbers, you can hear the actors panting. Everything that is beautiful comes at a cost. Arthur Darvill and Anoushka Lucas are both talented musicians and it’s when they sing that their characters – young Laurey Williams and cowboy Curly McLain – come alive. But it’s the supporting roles that make the strongest impression. Marisha Wallace electrifies as the frisky Ado Annie, who she transforms with her huge voice and commanding presence from a comedy sidekick into something much more savvy and meaningful. Patrick Vaill compels as outsider Jud Fry – more melancholy than menacing. Pore Jud is Daid is performed in pitch black with Vaill’s face filmed, projected and magnified across the back wall. It’s a haunting sight, and as his huge eyes flicker and wince there’s something in his filmed despair that very subtly brings to mind cyberbullying. It doesn’t all work and there are moments, particularly during the second half and its rejigged and highly stylised ending, when the innovations risk causing distraction. But this is still a brave and invigorating show that effortlessly unearths the ugliness that has always glimmered beneath Oklahoma!’s beautiful morning.

5/6/2022,"The 1984 Los Angeles Olympics are memorable for a lot of things – the jetpack at the opening ceremony, the historic performance by Carl Lewis, the greater focus on female athletes – but for nerds of a certain age, they will always be remembered for something quite different: broken joysticks. This was the first Olympic tournament of the mass video game era and it prompted a whole new genre of sports sims, designed to replicate the physical exertion of actually doing sport. I can just about recall watching the real Los Angeles games on TV, but it was the household tournaments I held with friends that really bring back memories. There’s some disagreement over where the multi-sport sim originated. At the burgeoning games studio Activision, pioneering designer David Crane had thought for a long time about making a sport game that simulated physical effort and his title The Activision Decathlon, arrived in late 1983, riding the growing hype for the LA Olympics to come. It allowed players to compete in 10 events, waggling the joystick left and right as quickly as possible to run faster and jump higher. At roughly the same time, Japanese company Konami brought the multi-event sports sims to the arcade with its brilliant coin-op Track and Field. This game allowed up to four players to compete in six athletics events, but instead of waggling a joystick, players used a two-button interface, alternatively pressing (or rather “bashing”) each one as quickly as possible. As the LA Olympics began, there was a sudden influx of new competitors. Along with home computer versions of The Activision Decathlon and Track and Field, we got Summer Games from US studio Epyx, which innovated on the formula by adding events such as diving and gymnastics that required timing and style rather than furious joystick waggles; and then there was the famed Daley Thompson’s Decathlon from Manchester-based Ocean software, with its chunky visuals and glorious soundtrack. In an era before mass household internet, these titles were the original multiplayer games, often allowing up to six friends to take part in epic, all-day tournaments. I can recall spending entire school holidays at my Commodore 64, surrounded by friends from my street, all trying to beat someone’s latest record in the pole vault or 110m hurdle, making our own world-record charts. I loved the way that, like genuine sports stars, we all discussed and developed our own techniques for play. We argued over the best joysticks for waggling – the hardy Competition Pro stick, based on the classic Atari design, was considered the crème de la crème for serious competitors (it was so good, we even considered a ban in our tournaments), while the showy but rather fragile Quickshot 2 could easily be wrenched in two during a particularly competitive 100m sprint. Later, when the excellent International Track and Field came to PlayStation, I was working for video game magazine publisher Future and every journalist in the building had their own approach to the button-mashing events. One colleague had a special cloth that he put over the buttons in order to provide optimal finger travel and reduce friction. No one thought he was taking it too seriously. Multi-sport games have always been about inclusivity, too (at least for able-bodied players). The simple controls and widely recognised events meant that almost anyone could play, without having to understand a lot of complicated instructions. With the release of Wii Sports in 2006, Nintendo took this concept to its logical conclusion, the console’s motion sensitive Wii remote providing tactile, gesture-driven control over events such as boxing, golf and tennis. Selling more than 80m copies, the game became a fixture of social gatherings, a means of closing the generation gap between the oldest and youngest members of a family. There is still a thriving Wii bowling league running in retirement homes throughout the US. I’ve always loved these games, especially the Epyx titles. I loved how they introduced me to new sports – the Canadian log rolling in World Games, the freestyle rollerskating in California Games – and how the controls have been refined over the years to take on board new technologies. It is also hard to overstate the impact that Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games had on a generation of players who grew up taking sides in that momentous rivalry. What a fine – yet also completely bizarre – symbol of the uniting power of sport. So it’s nice to see the newly released Nintendo Switch Sports introducing a new generation of players to the joy of multi-event sports games. They continue to challenge the hoary old stereotypes about games: that they’re antisocial and sedentary pursuits. Even in this era of Fortnite and Fifa Ultimate Team, there is fun to be had gathered around one screen in one place, competing to beat record scores, discussing techniques and tactics. It’s just that nowadays, we are not surrounded by a graveyard of knackered joysticks.",Arts/Games,Forty years of joystick waggling: the glory of multi-sport video games,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/06/forty-years-of-joystick-waggling-the-glory-of-multi-sport-video-games

5/6/2022,"Local election results mean three flagships have now been sunk in the past month: Westminster, Wandsworth, and the Moskva. Along with Barnet, the loss of those first two councils has contributed to the Conservatives’ London results being described as a “meltdown”, perhaps appropriately. During recent public appearances, Boris Johnson has looked like a novelty Boris Johnson candle left next to a radiator. Key to his survival will be the fact that you can’t afford to turn on the heating any more. In the capital, the prime minister is now about as popular as a no-fault eviction or eye contact on the tube. The Tories have even lost Mayfair, calling into question their strategy of impounding voters’ yachts. Outside London, it’s a rather more “mixed” picture for Labour. Keir Starmer prides himself on looking ready for court, but arguably needs to graduate from looking like the worried defendant in a photocopier-leasing scam. The real Beergate might turn out to be the fact that he doesn’t seem like the sort of guy people particularly want to have a beer with. One standout criticism you keep hearing is that Starmer’s “not going to set the world on fire” – a reminder that “Let’s burn it all down!” has actually been a vote-winner in the UK for the past few electoral cycles. At dawn, Labour were briefing the line that this was a “turning point election”, a description that really brings to life the 37-point-turn manoeuvre the party has been faultlessly executing since 2010. In news not unrelated to the above state of play for the two main parties, it was a very good night for the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Looking ahead, set your watch for the “coalition of chaos” warnings from some of the most chaotic politicians outside of Rome’s first civil war. Back to the prime minister, though, and reports he told aides ahead of the count that “we are going to get our arse kicked tonight”. “Our” arse? It does feel par for the course that Johnson is unable to take responsibility even for the arse. Far from the glutinous gluteals being attached to him personally, the arse is a collective backside that is shared, like a Netflix subscription, or blame in a tragic personal injury case. Meanwhile, it’s a measure of the clue-free zone in which the stricken country now finds itself that the eve of polling saw chatter that Johnson could be contemplating a snap election. That would bring us up to four general elections in a period of seven years, at which point the idea that we aren’t having some kind of constitutional nervous breakdown would feel slightly harder to sustain. Calling an election when you won an 80-seat majority not much more than two years ago feels like the equivalent of having a baby to keep your marriage together. A baby with your wife, I mean, not some art consultant or heavily injuncted Jane Doe. Then again, it’s said that some in the cabinet don’t even want part of their majority any more. On Thursday, it was reported that attorney general and acclaimed quarterwit Suella Braverman recently told Johnson he should expel “disloyal” Conservative MPs. Maybe the strategy of relying on Tory members of parliament being exposed as sex cases feels like it’s running down the majority too slowly. Having said that, at the current rate it’s possible that all Suella needs is a little patience. But as the Bank of England forecasts double-digit inflation and that the UK could plunge into recession, there will be some old-fashioned/idealistic/desperate people wondering: where are the ideas? What on earth is the plan? The government’s entire policy programme currently amounts to a small timeshare hotel in Rwanda and George Eustice’s suggestion that people might want to give supermarket value ranges a go. It all feels like busywork, the appearance of action. Far from attempting to shape events, the government seems to wait for them to turn up – good or bad – and then react to them. They remind me a lot of a newsdesk – perhaps inevitably, considering the country took the bold decision to elect a newspaper journalist to run it. Hard to think of a worse-run business we could pick the next leader from. A football club, perhaps, or a care home chain. Speaking of torpedoed flagships, whatever happened to levelling up, the supposedly overarching policy of the current administration? It ended up being one day in February, when Michael Gove reannounced a number of existing things as though they were new. Come to that, whatever happened to Michael Gove? The secretary of state for levelling up would have more visibility in a witness protection programme. I own a wonderful book about fantastical buildings that never ended up being built. I’m thinking of reshelving it alongside the 2015, 2017 and 2019 Conservative party manifestos, which contain a vast number of policies that never made it past the blueprint stage. 2015 promised seven-day GP access, and devoted a mere seven words to £12bn of welfare cuts. Three times as many words were given to their policy on polar bears. 2017 promised something other than the entire body politic convulsing over nothing but Brexit for more than two years. 2019 – well, how’s that working out for ya? Only against these yardsticks could those snap election rumours make a lunatic sort of sense. In the real world, it’s just possible that the solution to a number of acute challenges might be more complex than repeatedly switching the UK off then on again.

5/6/2022,"Italian police are racing to identify the owner of a superyacht linked to Vladimir Putin amid concerns it may be about to flee a shipyard in Tuscany. The Scheherazade, said to be worth $700m (£528m), has been under investigation since March for potential links to sanctioned Russians, including the president. A spokesperson for the Italian Sea Group, a company that repairs and builds luxury yachts, said the vessel, which has been undergoing a refit at its shipyard in Marina di Carrara since September, was scheduled to set sail by the middle of June. However, there are concerns the Scheherazade may be preparing to leave the boatyard, after a New York Times report that it had been moved out of dry dock and into the water on Tuesday. The newspaper cited a crew member who said it could leave the port imminently. Marianna Ferrante, the company’s marketing director, said: “Maintenance work is progressing and there are no scheduled departures anytime soon.” The company originally said the €6m refit would be completed in early 2023. The yacht is said to be equipped with a spa, swimming pools, two helipads, a wood-burning fireplace and a pool table designed to tilt so as to reduce the impact of the waves. Finance police in Marina di Carrara boarded the Scheherazade in early March as EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs kicked in over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They seized ownership documents from the yacht’s British captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce. At the time, US officials said they were also investigating whether the yacht belonged to Putin. Activists working with the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have also claimed Putin is the owner. The vessel has not been seized, and until its owner is identified and if necessary placed under sanctions, the ship is free to leave Marina di Carrara. A source at the finance police said the investigation was “very complex” owing to a web of company names that could be concealing the real owner. “As you can imagine, after all this time, it’s not been easy [to identify] an owner, because of all the companies in between,” the source said. “There is no more information we can give, and asking if it belongs to Putin is like a lottery.” The source would not confirm whether or not police were preparing to seize the vessel. An investigation by La Stampa newspaper in March linked the Scheherazade to Eduard Yurievich Khudainatov, the former president of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, via a shell company registered in the Marshall Islands. Khudainatov is not on the sanctions list.",News/World news,Fears superyacht linked to Putin may be about to flee Italian shipyard,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/fears-superyacht-linked-putin-may-flee-italian-shipyard-scheherazade
5/6/2022,"More than 300 people were evacuated from their homes and 49 hospitalized when a carbon dioxide pipeline run by an oil and gas company ruptured in a rural community in Mississippi. People were described as wandering around “like zombies” in the aftermath of the February 2020 incident. Less than a week later, Sharon Hewitt, a Louisiana state senator who has considered running for governor, filed a bill drafted by the operator of that pipeline, Denbury Resources, into her own state’s legislature. The law, passed in 2020, could make it more difficult for Louisiana landowners to dispute CO2 pipelines, which are used to transport carbon pollution captured from fossil fuel projects. The bill was introduced and signed into law the same year that Hewitt’s husband, Stan, earned up to $4,999 in royalties from Denbury, according to Hewitt’s 2020 financial disclosure statement. There have been other instances when Sharon Hewitt, who previously worked at Shell, has pushed for laws that would benefit her husband’s company, according to public records shared with Floodlight. Stan Hewitt has worked as an engineer for nearly a decade at LLOG Exploration. The firm is among more than 200 oil and gas companies that are embroiled in lawsuits brought by seven parishes, including New Orleans, over damage to Louisiana’s wetlands, which protect coastal communities from storms and store carbon – the primary greenhouse gas driving climate change. Hewitt sponsored two bills and one resolution aimed at negating the lawsuits brought by the coastal communities against oil and gas companies – including LLOG. In the past three years, she has introduced, co-sponsored and voted on at least four other pieces of legislation that would benefit the oil company her husband works for or his fossil fuel investments. Sharon Hewitt, her husband, Stan, and Denbury Resources, which is now called Denbury Inc, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “It’s so brazenly personal,” said Itai Vardi, a researcher at the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI), a watchdog group focused on revealing the influence of fossil fuel companies. “It seems like she’s just trying to fend off these lawsuits that are aimed at her husband’s and other companies’ bottom lines. It’s one level above your standard Louisiana legislator who might own stocks in Exxon.” There is a long history in the Louisiana state capitol of legislators passing laws that profit their respective industries, but public policy experts point to Hewitt’s record as evidence of the oil and gas industry’s outsized influence at the legislature, despite its diminishing role in the state’s economy. Louisiana is experiencing more intense storms, coastal flooding and tornadoes that strike at night because of climate change, and lawmakers like Hewitt are digging in to protect industry. While introducing the bill Denbury drafted, Senate Bill 353, Hewitt in a May 2020 legislative committee hearing described the measure as a “great example of collaboration between the department and the industry”. Public documents shared with Floodlight by EPI show that Hewitt worked closely with the oil and gas industry in multiple instances, including drafting legislation, writing testimony supporting it and sorting out legal problems. Hewitt was elected to the Louisiana state senate in 2015, after working for nearly 20 years as a mechanical engineer and oil and gas executive for Shell. In 2018, Hewitt was named National Legislator of the Year by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a corporate-supported conservative group known for pushing “model legislation” – covering everything from gun rights and immigration to energy industry regulation – in state legislatures. Critics say her financial ties and legislative actions are an example of how Louisiana lawmakers are deeply intertwined with the oil and gas industry and avoid corporate accountability which, in turn, makes the state more vulnerable to climate change-driven storms and flooding. “There is a point at which it goes beyond conflict of interest to the abdication of duty,” said Carroll Muffett, the president of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a non-profit focused on strengthening laws to protect the environment and human health. A profile of Sharon Hewitt on her website says she “consistently advocates for smaller government, less taxes, fewer frivolous lawsuits, and better jobs”. Hewitt’s original bill amending carbon capture regulations would have capped liability for corporations to 10 years after carbon capture projects ended, but that part of the proposal was nixed. What became law could scale back how much a landowner can weigh in on a planned carbon dioxide pipeline.Carbon capture has become the preferred climate solution for fossil fuel companies, many of which have lobbied for the technology at the state legislature and with its climate taskforce. At least nine projects have been announced in Louisiana that would involve building carbon capture technology on new or existing facilities. The technology allows fossil fuel firms to avoid strictly reducing their emissions and will require building out of thousands of miles of pipelines nationwide. Those involved in the technology are in a prime position to see investment from the federal government. President Joe Biden’s bipartisan Infrastructure Bill that passed in 2021 appropriates more than $12bn towards carbon capture and utilization projects. Those projects aim to pull carbon from the atmosphere or capture the heat-trapping emissions at the pollution source. The carbon is then condensed into a super-cold liquid, transported through pipelines and stored underground. More often it’s used to force more oil out of the ground – called enhanced oil recovery – resulting in increased oil production and continuing the dirty emissions cycle. Hewitt’s 2020 legislation essentially removed landowners in the path of carbon capture pipelines from the list of stakeholders to be considered. According to a trove of internal emails shared with Floodlight, one Louisiana department of natural resources staff member referred to the bill openly as “Denbury’s CCS bill”. “It’s unsurprising that a major CO2 pipeline operator would delete pipelines from the eminent domain processes,” Carroll Muffett of CIEL said. “What is regrettable is that anyone vested with the public trust would let them get away with it, particularly since Denbury was the pipeline operator behind the pipeline rupture in Mississippi.” The pipeline rupture in Yazoo county, Mississippi, sent 49 residents to the hospital, many of them disoriented and struggling to breathe. The gas displaced oxygen in the air, stalled people’s cars – which need oxygen to run – and made residents foam at the mouth. Environmental and community groups caution that carbon capture technology is not proven to work, will not address other forms of harmful air pollution and directs subsidies away from alternative renewable energy. The United Nations’ latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report does acknowledge that technology to pull carbon from the air or capture it from plants is needed, but it emphasizes that the bigger need is to stop producing and using fossil fuels, and that industry lobbying has stalled that progress.",News/Environment,Louisiana legislator pushes bills benefiting the oil and gas industry — and her husband,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/06/sharon-hewitt-louisiana-senator-oil-gas-industry
5/6/2022,"Having vowed to check out Donna and Rob Taylor’s new place the moment it opened, I got there eventually. The pair left the excellent, if somewhat outback gastropub The Compasses Inn in Crundale, Kent, at the end of last summer, promising they had bigger plans afoot. And here they are at Tallow: 26 covers and a 10-seat private dining room in Southborough, a leafy town in the civil parish of Tunbridge Wells, yet, I hasten to add, a whole 2.6 miles from the town’s main railway station. Do not, I beg you, say that Southborough is actually just Tunbridge Wells, or its residents will revolt. Well, they will after they’ve finished playing cricket on the common overlooked by the heroically pretty St Peter’s Church. Parking up on a Saturday lunchtime with the cricket in full swing is a bit like guest-starring in a Miss Marple mystery, perhaps even more so when you get to Tallow itself, a tall, narrow building painted a rather gothic dark grey. Just as it was at the Compasses, Tallow’s food is unquestionably good. More than that, it’s get-in-the-car-and-go good. It’s “How far is Southborough, anyway?” good. Rob Taylor’s cooking seems, on first glance at the menu, reassuringly straightforward – there’s a steak tartare starter and chocolate brownie on the pudding list – yet his work is much more surprising. Take one of the first offerings, a small, freshly baked wild garlic bread that was sticky, fragrant and vividly Kermit-coloured. There was no need for butter, because its innards were moist with some sort of buttery, salty, algae-like concoction. Such touches always show a restaurant that’s going the extra yard. In a similar vein, a pre-lunch snack of crisp lamb croquette with a neat, mint mayo topping was substantial yet delicate at the same time. Tallow’s kitchen is on the first floor, which must mean a heavy calf muscle workout for the serving staff every shift, up and down those stairs, but they do it with endless esprit. Donna and her staff have a bright style that leaves you unequivocal about the fact that they really care about that plate of barbecued loin of pork with confit belly and celeriac and horseradish puree, or that they have personally eaten everything on the menu and would quite happily eat it all again right now, if time and work commitments allowed. I can’t blame them, because there is always time for carbohydrates in the form of Tallow’s warm terrine of potato and Cashel blue: translucent layers of clearly deeply cherished spud mixed with pleasantly pungent blue-veined cheese from Tipperary. (Incidentally, we had Cashel blue delivered by the kilo during lockdown, until my heart valves begged Charles to stop, but I was still overjoyed to see it on a menu again.) Again, at face value, “potato and cheese terrine” doesn’t sound much to write home about, but this one is so much more than the sum of its parts. It was topped with a hedge of microherb salad so high that Donna quipped she’d been late for work because Rob had given her the chore of clipping it all from their home patch. Tallow’s steak tartare is likewise ludicrously pretty, dotted with rich confit egg yolk and the briefest suggestion of pickled shallot. My favourite course may well have been the hake starter, featuring plump, perfectly timed fried white fish in a heavenly puddle of elegant curry sauce, with three of the fattest, meatiest, shelled mussels drinking in the fragrant broth. This is my sort of fine dining: the highest-quality ingredients and intricate plating, but with the coy undertones of walking back tipsily from the chip shop. For main, we shared a roast thornback ray wing with a delightful green mess of broad beans and sea vegetables, and some smoked haddock bonbons. One day, I’ll write a thesis on the culinary differences between the croquette, the bonbon and the kushikatsu panko-crumbed skewer, but now is not the time. A tart of caramelised garlic and parsley with baby leeks and onion puree was beautifully constructed, but such a funky collaboration of flavours that it’s definitely not one for the allium-phobic. I sought refuge in a side of fresh Kentish asparagus – a huge whopping bundle of the stuff – that negated its one-of-your-five-a-day prowess with a thick dijon mayo and a scattering of crisp onions. As at The Compasses, the desserts at Tallow linger. Yes, there was a very good, light homemade shortbread with whipped vanilla cream cheese and fresh, sweet gariguette strawberries, but the rather dull-sounding “chocolate and hazelnut brownie” was nothing of the sort: instead, this was a plinth of rich chocolate-and-hazelnut mousse in a glistening pool of salted caramel and miso sauce – so much sauce, and so glossy, in fact, I could have styled my hair in the reflection. The whole assembly was topped with a perfect quenelle of coffee ice-cream, and followed by a wobble back to the car. Spring Saturday lunches don’t get much better than this.

5/6/2022,"Apithy examination of marriage and mental illness shortlisted for this year’s Women’s prize for fiction, Sorrow and Bliss begins as its protagonist Martha splits up with her forbearing husband, Patrick, and moves back into her parents’ house. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn that Martha has a mental health condition. When she was 17, on the morning of her French A-level exam, “a little bomb” went off in her brain, prompting her to go home and crawl under her father’s desk. Over the next 20 years, in order to deal with the chaos in her head, she continues to seek out confined, dark spaces where she lies “like a small animal that instinctively knows it’s dying”. The actor Emilia Fox reads Mason’s darkly funny novel, capturing Martha’s fury and confusion as well as her acerbic wit (the comparisons to Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag are not wide of the mark). Woven into her story is her maladjusted family, who include her father, Fergus, a poet whose career stalled shortly after he was designated “a male Sylvia Plath”; her mother, Celia, an alcoholic sculptor who is charismatic yet cruel; and sister Ingrid, who is both protective of and exasperated by Martha. And, of course, there’s Patrick, a sweet-natured doctor whom Martha has known since her cousin brought him home from boarding school one Christmas after his father forgot to send him a plane ticket home. Martha, who has precious little love for herself, knows that Patrick is too good for her. But the question remains: will he give her a second chance?

5/6/2022,"Peter Morgan, the Oscar-nominated screenwriter and creator of Netflix’s The Crown, is to explore the world of Russian oligarchs in a new play at the Almeida theatre in London. Patriots will star Tom Hollander as the businessman Boris Berezovsky, who was found dead, apparently hanged, at his Berkshire home in 2013. The play, set in Russia and the UK, features Vladimir Putin, whom the “kingmaker” Berezovsky helped into the Kremlin before the pair became foes. Berezovsky, who once owned Russia’s most powerful television station, fled to Britain, where he remained a prominent critic of Putin. The play’s story also involves Marina Litvinenko, widow of Berezovsky’s friend Alexander Litvinenko, the former spy who was murdered by radiation poisoning in London in 2006. There is a role, too, for Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea FC owner who is among the oligarchs to have had assets frozen in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich and Berezovsky were friends who ended up in London’s high court in 2012 for one of the biggest ever private litigation battles; Berezovsky claimed his ex-oil firm partner cheated him out of $5bn, but lost the case and was called an unreliable witness. Patriots is Morgan’s first play since The Audience (2013), which starred Helen Mirren as the Queen and inspired the writer’s blockbuster Netflix series The Crown, whose new series is set to be released later this year. Rupert Goold, the Almeida’s artistic director, will direct Patriots, which opens in July and is billed as “an unflinching story of ambition and the dangers of loyalty and love” at the dawning of a new Russia where “today’s patriot can fast become tomorrow’s traitor”. Will Keen has been cast as Putin, Yolanda Kettle will play Marina Litvinenko and Luke Thallon plays Abramovich. Further casting is to be announced. In an interview with Deadline, Goold said that the play will explore “the complicity and blindness of the west.” The production had been planned before the invasion of Ukraine in February, but then “took on a whole different filter” Goold added. Patriots was announced on Friday alongside another world premiere at the Almeida, The Clinic by Dipo Baruwa-Etti, whom Goold called “one of the country’s most exciting emerging talents”. Directed by Monique Touko, it is described as a political portrait of a woman “with a hunger for change”, and explores “how to rise from the ashes of a broken world”.

5/6/2022,"Icould not imagine that London might inflict any more visual damage to the Thames than it has already done. No city on earth has made such a mess of its river. But one of its biggest and most aggressive office blocks has just been approved on the South Bank in the heart of the capital. The slab – or rather tower and slab – that was approved by Lambeth council in March is to loom over the National Theatre opposite Somerset House. Its bulk will dominate every river view. The slab replaces the old ITV headquarters and is a behemoth in comparison. It will be more than twice the height of the neighbouring National Theatre. On the horizon it will be more prominent than St Paul’s or the Houses of Parliament. It is massive. The erection of such a building is patently an issue of civic if not national importance. It is inconceivable that central Paris or Rome would tolerate such an intrusion. Yet it has been approved on the say-so of just six members of Lambeth’s planning committee. They guiltily admitted it was likely to be “controversial and extremely unpopular” but justified it as “creating over 4,000 jobs”. There is no evidence of a job shortage in London just now, quite the opposite. The decision – and the absurdity of the reason – illustrates the collapse of serious town planning in the capital since Boris Johnson became mayor in 2008. Lambeth’s residents appear furious, their 260 objectors including councillors and the local MP, Florence Eshalomi. One councillor who voted for the slab agreed it was a “Marmite” block, but said it was justified as the developers, Mitsubishi Estate London and CO-RE, had promised that 1,000 jobs would be for “local residents”. These totally unenforceable pledges are like fluff in speculative developments, a sop to gullible councillors. That the block is also in a conservation area is merely an added insult to the concept of planning permission. Anyone who takes a new Thames Clipper downriver from Chelsea to Canary Wharf will see what the past 15 years have done to the metropolis. The shore is randomly lined with slabs and towers. They display no plan or cluster, no respect for context or community, certainly no architectural quality. Developers and their pet planners wave aside a concern for beauty as “subjective”. London is at the mercy of such philosophy. As for their utility, the towers are overwhelmingly empty investments. At the Tower at St George Wharf in Vauxhall, at 184 of the 214 flats over 50 storeys, no one was registered to vote in 2016. The idea that these buildings answer London’s “housing crisis” is sick; most are international bank balances in the sky. Yet Johnson promoted what he called “inward investment” on a highly publicised trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia in 2014. A foreign developer told me that the glory of building in London was that to gain approval: “A few dinners usually does the trick.” In truth the procedure is insidious. Revenue-capped London councils are chronically short of cash. A developer can propose a monstrosity and the planners may demur. The developer then asks them to “advise” on what they may allow, for a “fee” to the council. The planners become effective sponsors of the project before a planning committee, the architect “having taken our reservations into account”. Money swirls round everyone, except conservationists. London has no over-arching plan or vision. Each project is judged alone, devoid of wider implications, as if each borough was isolated somewhere in the country. Labour Lambeth has come to treat its Thames bankside as fringe territory, a lucrative source of income. Its Vauxhall blocks merge with Wandsworth’s Nine Elms towers up to Battersea power station and its Malaysia Square hub, so named to attract depositors. This Hong Kong-style planning for London was the baby of Boris Johnson’s former close aide, Eddie (now Lord) Lister, a wealthy developer lobbyist and former leader of Wandsworth council. The gated estates and ghostly towers are known in planning circles as “destreeted”. They stand as a bleak memorial to Johnson’s London. Technically the Lambeth decision is subject to call-in by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, but he has never shown the slightest interest in London’s appearance. He has no strategy for tall buildings and declined to intervene in the destruction of conservation areas, as round Paddington station and Fleet Street. He has now moved his office to the Royal Docks, opposite an extravagant but vacant 35-acre Chinese development, lauded in 2013 by Johnson as “a beacon for eastern investors”. It is rather a bank vault. The nearest to hope on the South Bank lies with the levelling up, housing and communities minister, Michael Gove. He recently intervened to protect Oxford Street from Westminster’s philistine council. Why he should back 4,000 more jobs in central London at a time like this is a mystery. London suffers an acute labour shortage, not a surplus, while the central areas office blocks are standing half-empty. Seeking to attract more investment and employment south to the capital is surely the last thing this government is about. It would make public mockery of levelling up. A blistering attack on the Lambeth slab has come from the former National Gallery and Royal Academy director Charles Saumarez Smith. He has pointed out that the government has set up a Building Better, Building Beautiful commission in an attempt to “inject beauty” into planning decisions. Unless this was cynical headline-grabbing, it is hard to imagine a more glaring case for its attention. At least the slab’s architects do not beat about the bush. Their name is Make. One wonders why they dropped the word Money.

5/6/2022,"Hi, Guide readers! I’m Keza, the Guardian’s friendly local video games editor (and writer of our games newsletter Pushing Buttons), taking over this week’s Guide to fill you in on what’s worth playing while you wait for the next episode of Better Call Saul to drop. Whether you’re in the mood for a vibey skateboarding game, pretend badminton or a grand fantasy epic, 2022 has been very kind to us so far. (And if you’re someone who thinks that video games aren’t for you then hey, stay with me. You never know, I might be able to persuade you otherwise.) First up, a game that seems directly aimed at everyone who’s ever taken a look at a Mondrian painting and said “But anyone could have done that”: Please, Touch The Artwork (PC, smartphones) is a puzzle game about abstract art, telling the genre’s origin story by letting you mess around with iconic paintings, trying to recreate their lines and colours. It makes you think about the art, how it’s constructed and what it means, and it’s also chill and unpressured, with no time limits or objectives to hurry you through. I’ve spent a couple of pleasant hours now poking at it on my phone when I don’t have the mental energy for anything more taxing (which, given the current state of the world, it quite a lot of the time. Another laid-back option is OlliOlli World, a welcoming skateboarding game that pairs a 90s counterculture vibe with a very 2022 street-art-and-chillhop soundtrack. I enjoy dressing up my little cartoon skater almost as much as tricking through the surreal skatescapes, wall-riding on billboards held up by giant bees. This becomes quite a hard game after a few hours, but never one that makes you want to throw your controller through the TV. Like in all good skating games, you can wring as many tricks and points out of each level as you can, or you can just focus on riding around, grinding and jumping and enjoying the sense of freedom. For anyone seeking something a little slower-paced, and more cerebral, this week’s new release Citizen Sleeper is essentially an interactive-novel-slash-board-game about a malfunctioning android that’s run away from its owners and is now trying to survive undiscovered on a dilapidated space station. Premise-wise it’s very Blade Runner, but involves much less action and much more thinking about the qualities of humanity and the evils of corporate capitalism, as it gets your brain’s cogs turning with its evocative text descriptions and sparse but beautiful illustrations. Tunic is another game whose gorgeous artwork is a large part of its appeal; it’s minimalist and lovely, a game about a little fox with a sword trying to solve a grand mystery as he explores an enigmatic island. If you ever played any of the older Zelda games in the 90s, it’s very similar – indeed, the whole game is kind of a tribute to the sense of mystery and adventure that Zelda and its ilk used to evoke in the days before Google and online walkthroughs. It has a manual written in runic script that you have to pore over and decode for clues about what to do next, worn and written-on like a beloved old comic. If you have 50+ hours to spare and a tolerance for steep challenge, there’s one game that’s dominated the conversation since it was released in February: fantasy epic Elden Ring, made by the Japanese developers behind the infamously intransigent and intellectually satisfying Dark Souls games. The fuss isn’t unjustified: this is one of the best games ever made, but you do need a lot of time and mental space for it to occupy. Imagine you’re exploring a medieval fantasy world, but basically everything from the dragons to the local wildlife is trying to kill you, and you’ve got some idea of what it entails. It’s an incredible world to get lost in. And lastly: if you’ve got a Nintendo Switch, get Nintendo Switch Sports. Remember waving a controller around to play tennis or bowling on the Wii? It’s that, but now there’s also badminton, sword-fighting, football and volleyball. Kids love it. Adults might initially be reluctant to get up and move around, but the second they hear the thwack of a pretend tennis ball, they’ll get into it too. It’ll be a winner at family gatherings all year. I hope you’ve found something you like the sound of. As mentioned, I write a whole other newsletter every week that’s all about the wild world(s) of video games – you can sign up here.

5/6/2022,"I started the bank holiday in traditional fashion, arguing with my 14-year-old son. This is why bank holidays exist, by the way, to remind you why secondary school exists, which is to let someone else irritate the hell out of your kids for six hours so you can go about your regular business of not irritating anyone that much. Sometimes these rows work out pretty well for me. Well, once: I said hurricanes were named alphabetically. With elaborate scorn that is still, 10 weeks later, delicious to me, he paced out all the letters between “D” and “U” before I casually mentioned that Eunice begins with E. Anyway, he claimed May Day was a religious ceremony, and I said it was actually International Workers’ Day, and we were both wrong – major religions hate equinoxes and ribbons, and anything else that might turn into an orgy, yet the celebrations commenced some centuries before organised labour – but I didn’t let that swerve me from my quest, which is to reminisce him into submission. We used to spend the day protesting, me and his auntie, I said, and he said “protesting what”, like nothing politically bad ever happened in the olden days, and OK, fine, he has a point. This was the early 2000s, when zero-hours contracts didn’t exist, and the minimum wage had just been brought in, and I think most likely we were fighting globalisation and the IMF, though what I chiefly remember was that we saw the actor Anna Carteret on the way up to the Trafalgar Square, and were amazed, because you really wouldn’t think of Juliet Bravo as a debt-jubilee kind of person. It was either that year or the one after that the police started kettling people, and my sister escaped after no more than 15 minutes by pretending to have a kidney infection, but I still managed to spin this to my kid as both of us having been arrested fighting The Man. He’d only been half-listening from the start, and by this point, I had no more than a third of his attention. But that’s part of my plan. One day, I will have poured so much anecdotage into him, extraneous information and exaggeration commingled, he will be unable to differentiate between me and Rosa Luxemburg. Pictures dropped of the Met Gala, the ultimate postmodern event: layer after layer of people arriving, then arriving further in, but do they ever truly arrive? Or is it like the layers of an onion, and at the dead centre, more onion? Guests were judged on two criteria: did they or did they not slay, which means “look good” in TikTok. And did they understand the assignment, which was “gilded glamour”? It’s much more complicated than it sounds, and you can’t just Google it to find out what Vogue says (though if you were to, you’d think New York between 1870 and 1890; you’d think embellishment and high structure; or you’d think Rockefeller and Vanderbilt and just apply a very thin moustache). Beneath the literal, lies a silent, much more stressful brief, which is to eclipse everyone else who knows how to use Google. Last year, all eyes were on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who had “tax the rich” splashed across her great meringue-y, wedding-esque dress. It was such a magnificent provocation. Half the nation exploded in “how much was a ticket to the gala, huh? HUH?”, and “if she’s so radical, how come she can afford clothes?” The grumble of indignant heartburn could be heard across the world. So that was a hard act to follow, and nobody this year came close. Cara Delevingne sprayed herself gold, Kim Kardashian starved herself for weeks in order to look nothing like Marilyn Monroe, and Naomi Campbell bejewelled her face, but none took the crown. And so the theme of the night was properly observed, perhaps for the first time in the gala’s nearly 75 year history: “the gilded age” was coined by Mark Twain, of course, in a novel depicting a riven society held together by a superficial layer of economic growth. To render it in fancy dress is too big a job for one person, and has to be a collective effort: there’s no “me” in satire. The full human ramifications of the leaked supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade and criminalise abortion for American women will take months and years to unfold. But the impact was felt immediately, across the world, as issues that were previously a matter of settled humanity were suddenly up for grabs. A presenter on the Today programme wondered whether women really needed abortions, when adoption exists; the Times newspaper decided this judgment was good, actually, because it really showed up the downside of a written constitution, whose ultimate impact was to put the lives of millions in the hands of nine unelected and now predominantly Christian fundamentalist judges. I heard people arguing for reproductive autonomy on the basis that having an abortion is a decision nobody takes lightly, as if the past 60 years – over which we established quite painstakingly that it’s nobody else’s business whether you’re doing it lightly or not – had never happened. I heard too many people to count describe it as a “women’s issue”, as if unwanted pregnancies were a niche concern, like nail varnish, that men can simply skate above. I read people arguing that this was all the fault of trans activists, for reasons that slid from one bad faith proposition to another. It’s been like a discursive oil spill, clarity obscured, everything polluted at a stroke. The situation is serious indeed for US citizens, who have a fight on their hands. But the contest is quite different in the UK, where the number of people who oppose reproductive rights is vanishingly small and has been for years. Apart from the obvious task of international solidarity, our critical job now is to remember that a few fanatics, toying with people’s lives for cheap rhetorical advantage, should not be allowed to set the nation’s temperature. It was polling day, and therefore it was dogs-outside-polling-stations day. I’ve left a dog outside every polling booth I’ve ever been in, even when I had to borrow one. I’ve left young dogs and old dogs, other people’s dogs, dogs that could safely be left sitting, calmly, without a lead, and dogs that could happily be tied to other dogs, but since 2017, I’ve had the worst dog in the world, and it’s a completely different proposition. He is a bolter, an enthusiast for people, especially children, adults and anyone in hi-vis, and an inveterate hater of all other dogs, especially large ones but also many small ones. In 2017, incompetent tethering meant he got into the primary school, I guess expecting to find children in there. It turned out not everybody liked dogs. Oh, the chaos. If I’d been actively trying to suppress votes, I couldn’t have done better. In 2019, he took agin a labrador tied up opposite and, when I emerged from my doomed vote casting, was yowlling an aria of hatred that was like a metaphor for our busted politics. This year, my Mr and I now wise to the dog’s antics, we voted in relay, one waiting outside at all times to make sure he didn’t throw the election. By the end of the week, TalkTV, the scourge of the woke liberal left, had hit rock bottom, with Piers Morgan having lost 80% of his audience, and political editor Tom Newton Dunn having aired a show on Tuesday that registered precisely no viewers. As Shakespeare said, “the worst is not/ so long as we can say this is the worst”, which I think for simplicity’s sake can be paraphrased: you haven’t hit rock bottom while Piers is still talking. Nobody could accuse Morgan of having failed to prepare: he’d spent the weeks ahead giving interviews about wokery, tweeting about woke waffle, generally allowing the woke to live so rent-free in his head, while spinning so much attention out of us, that I wonder whether there’s a way for us to actually start charging him rent. He covered wokeness in the RAF and brought in the actor Brian Cox, another scourge of wokery, to bemoan the woke. So many of the complaints are opaque: they’re very noisy, for people who claim to have been silenced; and so extremely visible, for people who’ve been cancelled. But scourges gonna be scourging, I suppose. Yet this stubborn philosophical problem remains: if Piers really is giving voice to the voiceless, why aren’t they watching?

Add the thyme and halved apricots, and simmer on a low heat for 15-20 minutes, until the fruit softens and the skins start to come away from the flesh. Turn off the heat, leave the fruit to sit in the hot liquid for five minutes, then gently lift out the apricots and pull off the skins. Return the fruit to the liquid, remove and discard the thyme stalks and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, make the almond cream. Toast the almonds in a dry pan until golden, then add the milk, sugar and double cream. When it starts to simmer, take off the heat and leave to infuse for an hour. Strain the milk mix through a sieve, and put the drained flaked almonds to one side. Soak the gelatine in ice-cold water until softened. Gently warm the milk mixture until steaming, then squeeze out the excess water from the gelatine, add the soft leaves to the hot milk and whisk to dissolve. Divide the milk mixture equally between four ramekins or dariole moulds, leave to cool slightly, then refrigerate for two to four hours, until completely chilled. Meanwhile, make the almond topping. Heat the oven to 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas 3. Put the reserved drained flaked almonds in a bowl with the icing sugar and toss to coat.

5/6/2022,"Raj Singh Chaudhary is the Indian actor, screenwriter and now director who has developed his career under the mentorship of Anurag Kashyap, the creator of the mob classic Gangs of Wasseypur. Chaudhary has now made a punchy, nihilistic, western-style thriller, co-written with Kashyap, with hints of Sergio Leone and the borderland paranoia of Cormac McCarthy. The setting is Rajasthan in the 1980s, but not the Rajasthan beloved of tourists and attenders of the Jaipur literature festival: this is the vast, forbidding and starkly beautiful Thar desert between India and Pakistan. Movie legend Anil Kapoor turns in a likable, authoritative performance as a veteran police inspector called Singh whose beat covers the remote village of Munabao. As he nears retirement, Singh has to deal with a sudden incursion of banditry and violence from drug runners bringing opium across the border from Pakistan, but also strange and macabre acts of violence that don’t have any obvious motivation. Moreover, Singh and his deputy (a nice comic turn from Satish Kaushik) are nettled by the sudden appearance of a mysterious stranger, who calls himself Siddharth, played by Harshvardhan Kapoor, son of Anil. Apparently, Siddharth is a dealer in antiquities; however, Singh suspects that he is one of the drug runners, concealing narcotics in these fake and supposedly priceless objects. Yet the truth is stranger still, and involves Siddharth’s relationship with a lonely and beautiful woman, played by Fatima Sana Shaikh. This is a stomach-turningly violent movie, and Inspector Singh isn’t above using beatings to get answers to his questions. There is a very impressive action sequence involving a Land Rover flying through the air. In the end, I felt the explanation for the violence was a little glib, but this is a film made with gusto and style.

5/6/2022,"Who is the greatest Marvel supervillain? Taika Waititi went on record this week to suggest that Christian Bale’s Gorr the God Butcher will soon be the biggest baddie in the pantheon, but as we’re yet to get so much as a glimpse of this alien killer of deities in advance materials, that’s still something of a moot point. “In my humble opinion, we have probably the best villain that Marvel’s ever had in Christian Bale,” the New Zealand film-maker told AP. Which got me thinking about some of the incredible antagonists the studio has given us. Who would you put in first place? This is a question whose parameters need to be defined. Is the greatest Marvel supervillain the one who had the most impact on the MCU? Or the one who drew the greatest gasps from audiences because the actor delivered the most eye-popping performance? If it’s the former then Thanos surely has to be up there with the worst of them. The nefarious Titan murdered half the universe’s population with the click of his fingers on the basis of what? Ill-conceived, wrong-headed binary statistics? It doesn’t get much more evil than that, and this alien invader’s machinations were terrible enough that they pretty much fuelled the MCU’s entire Phase Three. So our giant purple friend scores highly in terms of audience impact, too. It’s also probably one of the finest ever mo-cap performances, even if Josh Brolin ultimately got a little lost in the hi-tech architecture. How about Ultron? The devious artificial intelligence robot (voiced by James Spader) was certainly the most powerful supervillain yet seen when he achieved self-awareness for the first time in 2015. He gave Tony Stark his first crisis of conscience and helped usher Scarlet Witch into the arms of the Avengers. And yet it’s hard to argue with a bad guy who points out all humanity’s faults and seems to long merely for a world in which wild animals run free in a human-less paradise. Spader’s was also a less showy performance than we’ve seen elsewhere, being limited to that cold, machine-like voice. If scenery-chewing is your thing then Cate Blanchett’s Hela surely merits discussion. Despite being a “one and done” villain – so far she has only appeared in 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok – the slinky goddess of death tore the leather chaps out of Waititi’s movie with a performance of mascara-fuelled, rock-star splendour. It took the destruction of Asgard itself to stop her, otherwise she would probably be ruling over the nine realms to this day. Another Asgardian, albeit an adoptive one, we may want to consider is Loki. Tom Hiddleston’s character has raged and whined his way through more than half a dozen Marvel movies thus far, and with his own TV series. Only an actor with charisma to burn could get away with inviting the hideous Chitauri to invade Earth, thereby destroying half of New York, and still emerge as a fan favourite. The God of Mischief may currently be stuck in an alternate timeline, and we’re not sure if he’ll appear in the forthcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Given Patrick Stewart’s Professor X is rumoured to be making a return, and we’ve just seen half of Sony’s bad-guy back catalogue turn up in Spider-Man: No Way Home, all bets are off. Which brings us to Alfred Molina’s Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin. Despite having first appeared in Sony’s Spider-Man movies from the early noughties, they are now firmly established as Marvel Cinematic Universe villains after the events of Jon Watts’ epic finale to the Home trilogy – aren’t they? Does this mean those earlier films are also part of the MCU canon? If they were, these two would undoubtedly be in the top five. Molina was one of the first proper thespians to treat the role of supervillain seriously, his humanity always shining through the madness in 2004’s Spider-Man 2. Naturally he took his cue from Dafoe, whose ability to switch from horror-stricken victim to maniacal menace helped make 2000’s Spider-Man the greatest superhero movie of its time. Without Dafoe’s emotionally dextrous performance in No Way Home, that film’s introduction of the Multiverse, and the arrival of several villains from a different superhero universe, would never have been received so joyfully by audiences. For that reason alone, and to some controversy no doubt, I’m giving the Green Goblin the mantle of Marvel’s greatest supervillain. Of course, there are probably many alternate realities in which a different bad guy got picked – which one are you living in?",Arts/Film,Super bad: who is the greatest ever Marvel supervillain?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/06/greatest-ever-marvel-supervillain-christian-bale-gorr-thanos-loki
5/6/2022,"During the 2020 Democratic primary, Pete Buttigieg’s personal ambition led him to poison the conversation about education in America. Desperate for a contrast point with his rivals, the son of a private university professor aired ads blasting the idea of tuition-free college because he said it would make higher education “free even for the kids of millionaires.” The attack line, borrowed from former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, was cynicism masquerading as populism. It was an attempt to limit the financial and political benefits of a proposal to make college free. Worse, it was disguised as a brave stand against the oligarchs bankrolling Buttigieg’s campaign, even though it actually wasn’t – almost no rich scions would benefit from free college. Buttigieg and copycats like Amy Klobuchar were pushing a larger lie. Call it the means-testing con – the idea that social programs should not be universal, and should instead only be available to those who fall below a certain income level. It is a concept eroding national unity and being carried forward by wealthy pundits and a Democratic party that has discarded the lessons of its own universalist triumphs like social security, Medicare and the GI Bill. This week the Biden administration tore a page from Buttigieg’s book. The White House leaked that it is considering finally following through on Joe Biden’s promise to cancel some student debt – but not the $50,000 pushed by congressional Democrats, and only for those below an income threshold. In trial-ballooning the college debt relief proposal, the president is boosting the media-manufactured fiction that real, universal college debt relief would mostly help rich Ivy League kids – even though data from the Roosevelt Institute conclusively proves that canceling student debt “would provide more benefits to those with fewer economic resources and could play a critical role in addressing the racial wealth gap and building the Black middle class”. As the report points out: “People from wealthy backgrounds (and their parents) rarely use student loans to pay for college.” But setting aside how the media-driven discourse omits those inconvenient facts, what’s noteworthy here is the underlying principle. This latest discussion of means-testing follows Biden and congressional Democrats pushing to substantially limit eligibility for Covid-19 survival checks and the expanded child tax credit. Taken together, it suggests that Democrats’ zeal for means-testing is no anomaly – it is a deeply held ideology that is both dangerous for the party’s electoral prospects and for the country’s fraying social contract. The superficial appeal of means-testing is obvious: it promises to prevent giving even more public money to rich people who don’t need it. But in practice, means-testing is a way to take simple universal programs and make them complicated and inaccessible. Calculating exact income levels and then proving them for eligibility means reams of red tape for both the potential beneficiary and a government bureaucracy that must be created to process that paperwork. Data from the food stamp and Medicaid programs illustrate how means-testing creates brutal time and administrative barriers to benefits, which reduce payouts to eligible populations. In the case of means-testing student debt relief, those barriers may end up wholly excluding large swaths of working-class debtors. This is a feature, not a bug – it is means-testers’ unstated objective. They want to limit benefits for the working class, but not admit that’s their goal. Universal programs like social security and Medicare were what we once defined as “society” or “civilization”. They may be derided as “entitlements”, but the reason they have (so far) survived for so long is because their universality makes them wildly successful in their missions and more difficult to demonize. Their universality also precludes austerians from otherizing and disparaging the programs’ recipients. Means-testing destroys that potential unity. It may initially poll well, but it turns “entitlements” into complicated “welfare” programs only for certain groups, which then makes those programs less popular and makes the beneficiaries easy scapegoats for political opportunists. Think of Ronald Reagan’s “welfare queen” trope vilifying recipients of means-tested food stamps. Now sure, billionaires are eligible for social security and Medicare, and their kids are eligible for free K-12 education – and that aristocracy doesn’t need that help. But when those programs were created, we accepted that rich people being granted access to those programs along with everyone else was the relatively small price to pay for simplicity, universalism and the attendant national unity that comes with it. Not surprisingly, Democrats’ creation of popular universalist programs coincided with the most electorally successful era in the party’s history. Equally unsurprising: the shift to fake means-test populism has coincided with rising popular hatred of liberal technocrats and the Democratic party they control. What is surprising is that Republicans may be starting to understand all this better than Democrats. For instance, Donald Trump’s signature spending legislation offered direct, non-means-tested aid to small businesses during the pandemic. The former president touted a plan to just pay hospital bills for Covid patients who didn’t have coverage. The programs were hardly perfect, but they were straightforward, universal, relatively successful and extremely popular because they embodied a powerful principle: keep it simple, stupid. When it comes to student debt relief, there’s a rare chance for Democrats to also embrace simplicity – and prevent Republicans from outflanking them. More specifically, they can use the student debt crisis to finally return to their universalist roots – and they don’t have to skimp and provide merely $10,000 worth of relief. Biden could simply send out a one-page letter to every student borrower telling them that their federal student debt is now $0. Yes, Republican lawmakers would try to block it and affluent pundits would tweet-cry about it to each other. But amid all that elite whining and couch-fainting, Democrats would be launching a battle against an immoral system of education debt – and directly helping 40 million voters ahead of a midterm election. It’s so easy and simple – which is probably why they won’t do it. David Sirota is a Guardian US columnist and an award-winning investigative journalist.

5/6/2022,"Three people have been killed and at least four more injured in the central Israeli town of Elad, in the latest in a spate of street attacks that have sent tensions soaring in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent weeks. Israeli forces have launched a hunt for two Palestinian suspects, backed by a large deployment of security personnel, helicopters, drones and roadblocks. Police said the suspects were 19 and 20 years old and came from the town of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. Medics described a horrific scene in Elad, an ultra-Orthodox town near Tel Aviv. Israeli media identified those killed as Yonatan Havakuk, Boaz Gol and Oren Ben Yiftah, three fathers in their 30s and 40s who together are survived by 16 children. Funerals will be held on Friday. Police said the incident appeared to be a terror attack and Elad’s mayor called on residents to stay indoors during the hunt for the perpetrators. Late on Thursday the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said: “We will get our hands on the terrorists and their supportive environment, and they will pay the price.” Witnesses told Agence France-Presse that two assailants leapt from a car swinging axes at passersby. The injured included two people being treated for serious wounds, health officials said. “The joy of Independence Day was cut short in an instant,” the Israeli foreign minister, Yair Lapid, posted on Twitter. “A murderous attack in Elad that shocks the heart and soul. We will not give in to terror.” The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the attack. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, quoted him as saying: “The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to more deterioration of the situation.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, tweeted that the US “vehemently condemn[s] the terrorist attack in Israel today”. Details on how the violence unfolded remained unclear but several Israeli media reports said the assailants carried knives or an axe, while other reports suggested they used firearms. Paramedic Alon Rizkan, a first responder, described it as a “complex scene” and identified all the dead as men in their early 40s. The majority of Elad’s 50,000 residents are members of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community, hundreds of whom gathered in the attack area amid medical personnel and police. The worst wave of terrorist attacks in Israel in years began in late March, when an Islamic State supporter killed four people in a stabbing and vehicle-ramming incident in the southern city of Beersheba. Tensions then rose throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which coincided with the Jewish festival of Passover. Several separate attacks in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank carried out by Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel claiming to be from different factions have killed 16 Israelis, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainian nationals. Three Arab-Israelis and 27 Palestinians have died during the same period, among them the perpetrators of attacks and others killed by Israeli security forces in stepped-up army operations in the occupied West Bank. The deadly violence has been accompanied by clashes throughout Ramadan at the Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police, in which hundreds of Palestinians have been injured. The site, known as the Temple Mount in Israel, is holy to both Jews and Muslims, and lies at the geographical and religious heart of the decades-old conflict. The compound’s reopening to Jewish visitors on Thursday morning, after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, was again marked by violent scuffles; after Israeli police moved to arrest one of the Palestinians protesting against the Jewish presence, scuffles broke out in which police fired rubber-coated bullets and Palestinians responded by throwing stones. Two Palestinians were taken to hospital and one police officer was lightly wounded, medics said. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, praised Thursday’s attack in Elad but did not claim responsibility for it. “The storming of al-Aqsa mosque can’t go unpunished,” Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said. “The heroic operation in Tel Aviv is a practical translation of what the resistance had warned against.” The escalation of violence in the past six weeks has raised fears of another armed conflict similar to the 11-day war a year ago between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was in part triggered by unrest at Aqsa. Informally, Jews are allowed to visit, but not pray at the site. In recent years, however, growing numbers of Jewish visitors, sometimes praying or with police escorts, have inflamed longstanding Palestinian fears that Israel plans to annex the area. Israel says it is committed to maintaining the status quo, and accuses Hamas of inciting the recent violence.

5/6/2022,"The surest way to lose a battle is to not fight. Despite this fairly obvious logic, President Joe Biden and too many Democrats seem to have adopted a political strategy for the midterm elections of avoiding as many fights as possible. This path-of-least-resistance approach has resulted in plummeting presidential approval numbers and will further plunge the party off the cliff in the midterms if Democrats do not quickly reverse course. To turn things around, Biden should leap into the fundamental fights over what are called “culture wars” – and he should do so with gusto. It is unmistakably clear that we are engaged in an existential battle over the very identity of this nation. Is the United States of America primarily a straight, white, cisgender, male, Christian country, or is it a multiracial and multicultural democracy? The adherents of the former view are waging war with glee and abandon. From rightwing state legislatures to the supreme court, they are holding nothing back in attacking voting by people of color, the rights of the LGBTQ+ community, multicultural education, reproductive freedom and commonsense public health protections during a global pandemic, to name just a few fronts in this fight. With the heartening exception of the attempts to defend Roe v Wade, Democrats, for their part, are shying away from almost all of these fights beyond tepid words of disapproval, hand-wringing, and low-profile and lethargic counter-measures such as lawsuits and investigations. The result is a sharp decline in enthusiasm among the people who put the White House and Congress in Democratic hands, contributing significantly to the drop in polling approval numbers. Support among people of color has dropped 24% from its highs of last year. At this pace, Democrats will in fact lose the midterm elections, but it does not need to be so, and they can absolutely turn things around if they engage the fight. The misguided strategy that got us here results from bad math and electoral myopia by Democratic strategists and advisers. Despite an avalanche of empirical data, Democrats still do not believe that the majority of people are on their side. Yet with one exception (in 2004), the Democratic nominee has won the popular vote in every presidential election since 1992. The progressive trend is only accelerating as more and more young people – the majority of whom are people of color or white progressives – turn 18 every day. Every eight seconds, someone turns 18 and becomes eligible to vote. Democrats are so obsessed with wooing conservative white working-class voters that they fail to see the ever-increasing ranks of people of color who can strengthen their political hand. I call this phenomenon being “blinded by the white”. Fear of alienating an elusive white constituency has paralyzed a party in desperate need of decisive and bold action. The very fact that Democrats control the executive and legislative branches is proof that the worldview that America is and should be a multiracial nation enjoys majority support. In high-turnout elections such as presidential races, the majority usually supports the Democrat. The question for the midterms is how much of that majority will be sufficiently motivated to come back out and vote. The reason that the party that controls the White House typically fares poorly in midterm elections is that that party’s supporters tend to get complacent and do not see the urgent need to turn out and vote again. That is why it’s essential to engage in the fight. The failure to fight is dispiriting to one’s supporters and a significant contributor to falling polling numbers. Biden’s advisers believe that engaging in fights will harm their popularity, but the painful reality is that there is not much popularity left to harm. By throwing himself into the raging battles with gusto, he can reverse his polling descent and save Democratic control of Congress. Here are four examples of how he can send a strong signal to the electorate and inspire his supporters to mobilize to vote this fall. Reproductive freedom summit: The White House should host a strategy summit with leaders in the reproductive rights movement and women’s healthcare field to discuss ways to fight back on restrictive legislation and expand access to healthcare for all women. Say gay conference: Biden should organize a presidential “We Say Gay” conference in Florida as an in-your-face rebuttal to the homophobic legislation by Florida’s governor and legislature. In fact, he could hold the conference in Disneyworld, which is the target of punitive measures by the state government for its gay-friendly policies. That would have the added advantage of engaging the business community in the fight for equality. Read banned books: Biden should go to Texas, where nearly 1 million eligible African Americans didn’t vote in 2020, and hold an event at a school where he reads to students from Toni Morrison’s Bluest Eye, a book about Black identity. Multiple school districts in Texas have banned Morrison’s books, and Biden would send a strong signal by reading from the book and even bringing copies to hand out to students. Go door-to-door with voter registration groups: In the face of all of the voter suppression legislation sweeping the south and south-west, Biden should show his solidarity with groups working to expand democracy and encourage Americans to register to vote. He can go to Phoenix, where the Arizona legislature is trying to make it harder to vote, and go precinct-walking with members of a Latino-led, community-based organization such as Lucha. He could couple that with a speech at a local high school where he encourages senior-year students to come forward and register on the spot. These are just a few examples of how Biden could use his bully pulpit to lead the fight to make America the multiracial democracy that the majority of people want it to be. Such high-profile and, yes, controversial initiatives are both the right thing to do and the smart strategic step. They will inspire and mobilize the base, redefine the nature of the fight so that Democrats are on the offensive, and solidify Biden’s role as a strong and resolute leader. If he can find the courage to take such steps, Biden will reshape the political debate and put the Democrats on the path to victory in the midterms.

5/6/2022,"On Monday night, Politico reported that a majority of the US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, eviscerate a half-century of precedent, and leave the issue of abortion to the states. Five of the court’s nine justices are prepared to give the Republican base exactly what it demanded. The remaining question for the Republican party is whether answered prayers are the most dangerous. If the leaked draft of the majority opinion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization is close to the final cut, the court stands to energize otherwise dejected Democrats and put Republican members of Congress in Democratic-leaning states at risk. Expect the anticipated Republican House majority in the midterms to be smaller than currently projected. Indeed, the Democrats also now have a real shot to maintain their control of the Senate. Overnight, their odds of retaining seats in Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and New Hampshire, while flipping Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, improved. Beyond federal offices, fights will now be waged this fall over governorships and legislatures in Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020, but where the incumbent governor is a Democrat, and the legislature is in the hands of the Republican party. In a post-Dobbs world, look to the states to emerge as roiling battlegrounds. Make no mistake, the draft opinion is sweeping. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Justice Samuel Alito writes for himself and four of his colleagues. “It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” Along the way, the ruling also offers implicit criticism of the court’s prior decisions on personal autonomy. Prior precedents on contraception, interracial marriage, consensual sex and gay marriage are now at risk. At a February debate among Michigan’s prospective Republican candidates for attorney general, all three men, including Matthew DePerno, Donald Trump’s choice, criticized Griswold v Connecticut. In that case, the US supreme court struck down a state law that barred the sale of contraceptives to married couples. DePerno, an advocate of election conspiracy theories, framed his understanding of this this way: “The supreme court … has to decide, mark my words, that the privacy issue currently is unworkable. It’s going to be a states’ rights issue on all these things, as it should be.” DePerno is also the state Republican party’s officially preferred candidate. Elissa Slotkin, a moderate Michigan Democrat, tweeted on Monday night: “If tonight’s news is true, Michigan’s 1931 state law banning abortion would snap back into effect, making any abortion illegal in our state – even if the mom will die, or if she was raped by a family member. No exceptions.” A former member of the US intelligence community and the wife of a retired army helicopter pilot, Slotkin added: “My poor mother is turning over in her grave. The House has already voted to codify Roe – let all Senators be on record on this one in an up or down vote.” In the same neo-Confederate spirit as Michigan’s DePerno, the Indiana senator Mike Braun offered up his benighted take on interracial marriage. Braun argued that like abortion, interracial marriage should be left to the states to decide – not the federal judiciary. Said differently, he was arguing that the supreme court got it wrong in Loving v Virginia. “When you want that diversity to shine within our federal system, there are going to be rules and proceedings, they’re going to be out of sync with maybe what other states would do,” Braun announced. “It’s the beauty of the system, and that’s where the differences among points of view in our 50 states ought to express themselves.” After the ensuing uproar, Braun walked his words back. But in light of Politico’s reporting, the Democrats now have names, faces and an issue. Think ready-made campaign ad. To be sure, clearer Republican heads viewed the wholesale gutting of Roe as a threat to the Republican party’s elected officials. In the summer of 2021, they attempted to guide the court’s hand; they failed. Last July, 228 Republican members of Congress, 44 senators and 184 House members, filed an amicus brief in support of the Mississippi abortion law in question. Nowhere did the Republican submission refer to contraception, interracial marriage, or individual autonomy. Likewise, the word “privacy” only appeared as a part of a title of a footnoted law review article. Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert couched their arguments in pastels. Words like “previability” filled the page, as did polling data. Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, however, were having none of that. For them, it is time to return to what they consider the original constitution. More than seven in 10 Americans oppose overturning Roe even as the public is split over where to draw a line. In Texas, 77% support legal abortions in case of rape and incest. Not all restrictions are the same. America’s cold civil war just got really hot. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York.

5/6/2022,"Good morning. A third United Nations operation was under way this morning to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which the UN secretary general has described as a series of “hellscapes”. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remain trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said a convoy was headed to Azovstal “to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell … and take them back to safety”. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said people would be evacuated from Mariupol at midday local time on Friday. The UN and the Red Cross said they had so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steelworks area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week. Meanwhile, US officials have reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in the Ukraine war. Why is Putin so determined to capture Mariupol over the next few days? As Victory Day, 9 May, approaches in Russia, Vladimir Putin has yet to win any prize in two months of war in Ukraine that can be shown off to the Russian people. But Mariupol could be close. Here’s how Victory Day became central to Putin’s idea of Russian identity. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 72 of the invasion. Joe Biden has named his new press secretary, after it was announced that Jen Psaki will leave the administration and is expected to become a TV host at MSNBC. Karine Jean-Pierre, currently the principal deputy press secretary, will take over the role after Psaki leaves in mid-May. Jean-Pierre, a political analyst, was Kamala Harris’s chief of staff during the vice-president’s presidential campaign in 2020 and served on Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. She was also an adviser and spokesperson for MoveOn.org, a progressive Pac. Jean-Pierre will be the first Black person and first out gay person in the role. She has filled in for Psaki on several occasions, most recently while her predecessor was quarantining with Covid-19. “She is passionate. She is smart and she has a moral core that makes her not just a great colleague, but an amazing mom and human,” Psaki tweeted. “Plus, she has a great sense of humor.” What has Biden said about her appointment? Biden lauded Jean-Pierre’s “experience, talent and integrity”. He said: “Jill and I have known and respected Karine a long time and she will be a strong voice speaking for me and this administration.” When will Psaki leave? Her last day will be 13 May. Republicans in Louisiana have advanced a bill to make abortion a crime of murder, as a draft decision that would end abortion rights continues to spark nationwide protests and police in Washington raised “non-scalable” fences around the supreme court. Supporters admitted the bill, under which a woman terminating a pregnancy or anyone assisting her could be charged, was unconstitutional – as long as Roe v Wade was law. The supreme court is expected to formally overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case that established the right to abortion, in June. Danny McCormick, the state representative behind the Louisiana bill, said: “We can’t wait on the supreme court.” Since the draft ruling that seems set to overturn Roe was published by Politico on Monday night, Democrats have warned of a likely torrent of challenges to established rights. What else is happening? Extreme anti-abortion groups are now emboldened to fight for laws that ban ending pregnancies conceived in rape or incest. How have the medical community reacted? “If this decision ends up being similar to what [was leaked], this is going to substantially affect abortion care, obstetrics care and healthcare more generally,” said Dr Nisha Verma, a Darney-Landy fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Local Conservative leaders in the UK have urged the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to consider his position after losing flagship London councils to Labour and council seats across the south of England to the Lib Dems, with several blaming Partygate and the cost of living crisis. A week before election day 2020, the US secretary of defense was so worried that Donald Trump would seek to involve the military in the election in an attempt to hold on to power, he told the general commanding the US national guard to notify him of any communication from anyone at the White House. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has confirmed there is no intention to turn away from China’s zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech that also warned against any criticism of the policy. He defended the “scientific and effective” mass lockdowns despite protests, shortages and damage to economic growth. Donald Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani is not expected to appear at an interview scheduled for today with the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack, throwing into jeopardy the prospect of his cooperation, say sources familiar with the matter. US stock markets suffered their worst day of the year on Thursday as investors worried about the Federal Reserve’s plans to raise interest rates to tackle soaring inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 1,000 points (3.1%). The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 3.5% and 4.9% respectively. Tech stocks were particularly hard-hit, with Amazon dropping 7.6% and Tesla falling 8.3%. The steep fall came one day after the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, announced the sharpest rise in interest rates in more than 20 years. Lee Grant, child of the Depression, survivor of the anti-communist blacklist, director, Oscar winner and – incredibly – 95 and looking nothing of the sort, is standing in her Manhattan kitchen. Having survived waves of oppression in her youth, she is not done yet. “I feel there’s some way that I can still somehow do something. I don’t know what.” Experience makes her confident: something always turns up. “Life is like that. You slip to another place, go into another world, and you’re curious, and you take sides. And it’s a kind of miracle.” Firefighters in New Mexico have slowed the advance of the largest wildfire burning in the US, as Joe Biden declared the situation a disaster. The extent of the fire is not a surprise to experts. Wildfires have become a year-round threat in the drought-stricken west – moving faster and burning hotter than ever due to the climate crisis, scientists and fire specialists have said. “Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,” says Gregg Garfin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, “and turning the dial up”. Liam Neeson is making a bid to become the greatest interviewee in the world. Every other celebrity understands and adheres to the rules of the game. Their job is to promote a project, to better increase its revenue. Everyone, that is, except Neeson. Because his interview tactic is different. Neeson likes to sit back, answer questions about his newest film and then, just as everyone is getting ready to pack up for the day, blurt out the single maddest thing that comes into his head, writes Stuart Heritage.

5/6/2022,"When Edgar becomes the ruler of England at the end of King Lear, he pledges to build a country in which people “speak what we feel, not what we ought to say”. But increasingly there is the possibility of jurors for the 2022 TV Baftas using their votes to do the opposite – which complicates the task of predicting the winners. Sometimes this will arise from the proper and necessary pressure for more diversity. However, this may raise dilemmas for those who objectively feel that a non-progressive veteran has done the best work of the year. And, with Channel 4 and the BBC under threat of reform from the government, there may be a temptation to back them for symbolic reasons. Conversely, some panellists may fear that honouring a great programme about Donald Trump is somehow honouring the notorious 45th president. So the definition of “the best” is even more hedged than in the past. Here are my views on what should/will win.  In My Skin (BBC Three) Manhunt: The Night Stalker (ITV) Unforgotten (ITV) Vigil (BBC One) After four series of twisty-plotted writing, Chris Lang’s cold case series Unforgotten has never won a Bafta. So, with Vigil getting higher marks for atmosphere than logicality, it really should be Unforgotten. But a surprise win for In My Skin in the best writer section at the earlier Bafta Craft awards suggests a challenge from Kayleigh Llewellyn’s teen angst drama here.  It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Landscapers (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Stephen (ITV) Time (BBC One) In a gold-bronze-silver run off, Landscapers would miss the podium. It’s a photo-finish between the other three, but It’s A Sin had the most complex subject matter and Russell T Davies – after being an also-ran for the equally excellent Years And Years and A Very English Scandal – deserves first place.  Call My Agent! (Netflix) Lupin (Netflix) Mare of Easttown (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Squid Game (Netflix) Succession (Sky Atlantic/HBO) The Underground Railroad (Amazon Prime) This jury may still be arguing now. The impossibility of adjudicating between six of the most impactful dramas of the last decade – let alone last year – will surely drive pressure for more than an International category for 2023. Until then, if those who claim that Netflix has peaked are right, its trio in this line-up represents a high watermark. Mare of Easttown, Succession and Call My Agent have the best writing and acting, but Squid Game was a cultural phenomenon. That said, I’d – just – go for Mare of Easttown.  Death of England: Face to Face (Sky Arts) Help (Channel 4) I am Victoria (Channel 4) Together (BBC Two) Future historians will note that all four contenders touch on the Covid pandemic. The National Theatre could also win its first Bafta for Death of England, Roy Williams’ and Clint Dyer’s film about British racial politics, shot in the locked-down building. But if Channel 4 is hoping for a load of trophies to wave at the government, its campaign should be helped by the likely victory of Help.  David Thewlis – Landscapers (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Hugh Quarshie – Stephen (ITV) Olly Alexander – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Samuel Adewunmi – You Don’t Know Me (BBC One) Sean Bean – Time (BBC One) Stephen Graham – Help (Channel 4) A good example of expanded shortlists (there used to be only four names) allowing true diversity. The “next generation” case is strongly made by Olly Alexander’s gay tragic hero in It’s A Sin, against the “great generation” represented by Sean Bean as a repenting prisoner in Time, although Bean is ironically under pressure from his Time co-star, Stephen Graham, as a Covid care home patient in Help. Graham has strong acting heat around him but this probably will – and just about should – be Alexander’s.  Denise Gough – Too Close (ITV) Emily Watson – Too Close (ITV) Jodie Comer – Help (Channel 4) Kate Winslet – Mare of Easttown (Sky Atlantic/HBO) Lydia West – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Niamh Algar – Deceit (Channel 4) Comer’s role as a carer in Help confirms that she has the talent to become an all-time great. However, as a guilty detective in Mare of Easttown, Winslet gave one of the most physically, psychologically and vocally precise performances ever seen on TV, and it would be bold to knock back an Oscar, Emmy and Bafta Film winner at her first bid for a Bafta TV trophy.  Callum Scott Howells – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) David Carlyle – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Matthew Macfadyen – Succession (HBO/Sky Atlantic) Nonso Anozie – Sweet Tooth (Netflix) Omari Douglas – It’s a Sin (Channel 4) Stephen Graham – Time (BBC One) The inclusion of three men from It’s A Sin, though huge kudos for the show, probably prevents one of them winning, especially if (naughty as it is) panellists gamble on the best actor judges doing right by Olly Alexander. Stephen Graham has an unusual chance of taking both Actor and Supporting in the same year and would deserve to, but there was widespread dismay that Macfadyen missed out last year for his brilliant performance in Quiz, and Succession is admired as TV at its finest, so he would be a very popular victor.  Cathy Tyson – Help (Channel 4) Céline Buckens – Showtrial (BBC One) Emily Mortimer – The Pursuit of Love (BBC One) Jessica Plummer – The Girl Before (BBC One) Leah Harvey – Foundation (Apple TV+) Tahirah Sharif – The Tower (ITV) Very unusually, most of the performances here came in shows with an indifferent critical reception. That may help Tyson, in the acclaimed and multi-nominated Help, and Sharif, who brought subtlety to The Tower, with Tyson probably just ahead.  The Graham Norton Show (BBC One) The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan (Channel 4) Race Around Britain (YouTube) The Ranganation (BBC Two) The choice between established talent and exciting newcomer is rarely as clear as between one of the all-time greats – Graham Norton, eight wins in this genre, five nominations – and Munya Chawawa, whose super fresh Race Around Britain makes YouTube a serious player. Bafta probably will – and should – choose Chawawa.  Fearless: The Women Fighting Putin (ITV) Four Hours at the Capitol (BBC Two) The Men Who Sell Football (Al Jazeera English) Trump Takes on the World (BBC Two) The category in which “message voting” will have been most likely. BBC Two’s pair of end-of-Trump shows feel the strongest, with my preference for the great documentarian Norma Percy’s Trump Takes On The World. But Fearless, featuring three opponents of President Putin, feels the likely winner.  The Chase (ITV) Moneybags (Channel 4) Richard Osman’s House of Games (BBC Two) Steph’s Packed Lunch (Channel 4) If “hands off Channel 4, Nadine Dorries” has been a factor in the ballots, this category offers two opportunities out of four, both products of the north-based UK content strategy that is one of the network’s defences against privatisation, although Steph’s Packed Lunch has controversially low ratings. The Chase and House of Games are two schedule thoroughbreds, but Moneybags seems the frontrunner, as a pertinent advert for Channel 4’s purposes.  Alison Hammond: I Can See Your Voice (BBC One) Big Zuu: Big Zuu’s Big Eats (Dave) Graham Norton: The Graham Norton Show (BBC One) Joe Lycett: Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back (Channel 4) Michael McIntyre: Michael McIntyre’s The Wheel (BBC One) Sean Lock: 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown (Channel 4) This jury has to choose between two much admired living comedians (Graham Norton, Michael McIntyre) and a recently dead one: Sean Lock. He would be a popular winner but, in the past, the Baftas, like the Oscars, have shown reluctance to pick dead nominees. Alison Hammond is more admirable than the format she’s listed for and, with a possible feeling that Norton’s cabinet trophy is full enough, my hunch is that this will be Big Zuu v Joe Lycett, with the consumer reparations remit of the latter’s Got Your Back proving attractive in a cost-of-living crisis.  An Audience With Adele (ITV) Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway (ITV) Life & Rhymes (Sky Arts) Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One) Not the section for jurors hoping to refresh the winner lists. Takeaway and Strictly are habitual shortlistees and former winners. Socially committed poetry show Life & Rhymes took the trophy last year. Even the least obvious contender was shortlisted for Adele at the BBC in 2016. But the Strictly showreel will surely have included 2021’s first two-man couple and the first deaf contestant/winner, making an unanswerable case for a 19-season series having found new ground.  The Detectives: Fighting Organised Crime (BBC Two) 9/11: One Day in America (National Geographic) Undercover Police: Hunting Paedophiles (Channel 4) Uprising (BBC One) Steve McQueen, the only person to have won an Oscar and a Turner prize, should have added a Bafta TV award for Small Axe last year and surely now must for Uprising, his and James Rogan’s three-parter about the New Cross fire of 1981, an eerie warning (ignored) of future racial injustices including Grenfell.  Big Zuu’s Big Eats (Dave) Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing (BBC Two) Sort Your Life Out (BBC One) The Great British Sewing Bee (BBC One) Likely the most gentle judging meeting with two cosy formats – celebrity angling and amateur needlework – up against a slightly edgier food show and a domestic decluttering format. I suspect Dave can dust its not overloaded awards shelf as Liverpool FC supporter Big Zuu takes one of the few trophies his team can’t win this year.  Aimee Lou Wood – Sex Education (Netflix) Aisling Bea – This Way Up (Channel 4) Anjana Vasan – We Are Lady Parts (Channel 4) Natasia Demetriou – Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) Rose Matafeo – Starstruck (BBC Three) Sophie Willan – Alma’s Not Normal (BBC Two) With 50% of the shortlist and an indignant anti-privatisation mood within the industry, Channel 4 feels strongly placed to win and, from its trio, Anjana Vasan feels the most deserving choice for the glorious Muslim punk band sitcom We Are Lady Parts.  Jamie Demetriou – Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) Joe Gilgun – Brassic (Sky Max) Ncuti Gatwa – Sex Education (Netflix) Samson Kayo – Bloods (Sky One) Steve Coogan – This Time with Alan Partridge (BBC One) Tim Renkow – Jerk (BBC Three) What’s most interesting here is that five of the six are on minority channels, suggesting good comedy is only happening on the edge. Renkow, for his bold disability comedy, will possibly edge it over Sex Education’s Gatwa.  The Brit awards 2021 (ITV) The Earthshot prize 2021 (BBC One) The Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance (BBC One) Springwatch 2021 (BBC Two) This argument should hinge on editing and camerawork, but probably comes down to topicality/popularity of content. The Earthshot Prize, featuring royalty actual (Prince William) and televisual (David Attenborough) feels like the winner.  Channel 4 News: Black to Front (Channel 4) Good Morning Britain: Shamima Begum (ITV) ITV News at Ten: Storming of the Capitol (ITV) Sky News: Afghanistan: Endgame (Sky News) The Bafta category I’d cancel: how can technical excellence be separated from the emotive impact of the horrors covered? The biggest news is the absence of BBC content, signalling urgent work for new journalism supremo, Deborah Turness, incoming from ITN. To avoid the queasiness of choosing which war, riot or hostage situation matters more, the best choice would be the concept edition in which Channel 4 News used only people of colour.  Gogglebox (Channel 4) Married at First Sight (E4) RuPaul’s Drag Race (BBC Three) The Dog House (Channel 4) In my house, Delilah and Fred strongly believe that The Dog House should take the biscuit, and a human jury will also surely have been moved by this lovely attempt to match unwanted pets with owners also needing rescue. But I’ve warned my labrador and jack russell advocates that Rupaul’s Drag Race has a big following in the non-canine world and will be a threat.  Alma’s Not Normal (BBC Two) Motherland (BBC Two) Stath Lets Flats (Channel 4) We Are Lady Parts (Channel 4) Motherland went to new, darker areas in series three but, if there is pressure to go fresher, and given that Sophie Willan remarkably won the writer’s award last year for the pilot of Alma’s Not Normal, We Are Lady Parts would be my winner.  Hollyoaks Saved My Life (YouTube) Our Land (Together TV) People You May Know (Financial Times) Please Help (BBC Three) Viewers may feel they’ve accidentally switched over to the British Newspaper Awards if – and, I hope, when – the Financial Times takes a Bafta for its drama about data security in the pandemic, written by the super-talented James Graham.  9/11: Inside the President’s War Room (Apple TV+) Grenfell: The Untold Story (Channel 4) My Childhood, My Country – 20 Years in Afghanistan (ITV) Nail Bomber: Man Hunt (Netflix) Another concerning no-show for the BBC. Channel 4’s revelatory Grenfell investigation should win.  Casualty (BBC One) Coronation Street (ITV) Emmerdale (ITV) Holby City (BBC One) EastEnders will be miffed to have missed out. Holby City hasn’t won since 2008 and this is its last chance to enter as it finished in March. Expect the soap community to give a big send-off and a rebuke to the BBC bosses who binned it.  Black Power: A British Story of Resistance (BBC Two) Freddie Mercury: The Final Act (BBC Two) The Missing Children (ITV) Silenced: The Hidden Story of Disabled Britain (BBC Two) Steve McQueen’s extraordinary awards shelf could contain two TV Baftas if Uprising takes factual series and this one is won by Black Power, although McQueen’s colleague on both, James Rogan, is also up against them in this round for the bio-doc about the Queen frontman.  The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix (Sky Sports) ITV Racing: The Grand National (ITV Sport) Tokyo 2020 Olympics (BBC One) Euro 2020 Semi-final: England v Denmark (ITV Sport) As usual in this category, you might as well draw lots. When I put them in a hat, the Grand Prix came out first, which is as good a bet as any.  An Audience With Adele: Adele surprised by the teacher who changed her life (ITV) I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! Ant and Dec dig at Downing Street’s lockdown parties (ITV) It’s A Sin: Colin’s devastating Aids diagnosis (Channel 4) RuPaul’s Drag Race UK: “UK Hun?” – Bimini’s verse (BBC Three) Squid Game: Red Light, Green Light game (Netflix) Strictly Come Dancing: Rose and Giovanni’s silent dance (BBC One) Whereas other juries are encouraged to set emotion aside – with, arguably, increasingly little success – the public vote is strictly visceral. Feelings about the current government may drive clicks for Ant & Dec’s impressive political satire, but the crowd-pleaser (and a powerful use of TV) is the silent dance in Strictly.",Arts/Television & radio,It’s A Sin to Mare of Easttown: who will win the 2022 TV Bafta awards – and who really deserves to? ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/06/tv-bafta-awards-2022-predictions-its-a-sin-mare-of-easttown
5/6/2022,"Why will I love it?Fans of Little Shop of Horrors will love Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum, a monster of a plant that brings tropical vibes to every room. Light or shade?Indirect bright light. Where should I put it?In a large, empty area, as this plant takes up a lot of space, often reaching an ultimate spread and height of between two and four metres, although it is usually smaller when grown indoors. And beware: it is toxic to cats and dogs. How do I keep it alive?It appreciates warm, humid surroundings, so mist frequently and place the pot on a tray of wet pebbles if that’s not enough. It likes moist soil, so water weekly in summer – ensuring that only the top 5cm of soil dries out – and sparingly in winter. If the leaf tips dry out, it needs more humidity, more water or perhaps lower light exposure. You can cut around the brown tips with scissors and make the leaves look happy again. Did you know …The species name, bipinnatifidum, is made up of the Latin prefix bi, for “double”, and pinnatifidum, for “cut into the shape of a feather”, referring to the plant’s symmetrical, feather-like split leaves.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Houseplant of the week: cut-leaf philodendron,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/06/houseplant-of-the-week-cut-leaf-philodendron
5/6/2022,"There’s a whole suite of perennials in sunset shades that are perfect for darker corners. They will thrive in dappled shade, and with a sunny exuberance you might not expect in such areas. This is not the restrained, cool (dare I say slightly dull) elegance of the pure white forms; no, these come in cocktail colours of peach, pink and apricot. A group of woodlanders that belong to the fumitory subfamily of the poppy family have delicate fern-like foliage in blue-greens and grey-greens, and thrive in damp, shady conditions: one of these is Corydalis solida subsp solida “Beth Evans”, which is up and out now, with sugar-pink flowers. It grows not much higher than 20cm and forms a clump of about the same size; it needs rich soil and to be next to neighbours that won’t muscle it out. In a similar vein, but with more glaucous foliage, is Dicentra “Filigree” with its deep pink-red flowers, and Dicentra formosa with mauvish-pink flowers that dangle over the leaves. All of these look wonderful with smaller-leaved hostas, such as Tiarella “Pink Skyrocket” or ferns. I love the coppery-red new growth of the shield fern Dryopteris erythrosora, with its triangular leaves. It is slow-growing enough to not overwhelm the others, though is not completely hardy. A fully hardy choice would be Polystichum setiferum “Herrenhausen”, with its lacy rosette of finely divided leaves. One of our loveliest native ferns, it complements whatever it sits next to in a woodland setting. These things are all a little low-growing, however, and many will die back for summer, so it is wise to add something that will lift the eye away from spent foliage. Digitalis purpurea “Sutton’s Apricot” has peachy-apricot flowers along one side of its flower spike, over hairy dark-green leaves. Or, if you are feeling a little bolder, Digitalis “Illumination Pink” – a cross between our native foxglove and the Canary Islands variety – gives a truly tropical sunset in peach and hot pink. It also flowers right into August. For a little less neon, the silvered leaves of Lamium maculatum “Pink Pewter” are good enough alone, but from midsummer onwards, its pale, sugar-pink flowers will entice bees. This is a creeper that will spread and is unfussy about soil type. It won’t mind a little dry shade, too, making it very useful for suppressing weeds. Or if your soil stays a little more damp, the water avens Geum rivale “Leonard’s Variety” has beautiful coppery-pink flowers on reddish-brown stems, and if you keep deadheading it will flower from late spring through to late summer. It won’t survive deep shade, but is perfect for a dappled corner.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Shady characters to light up your garden’s darker corners | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/06/shady-flowers-to-light-up-your-gardens-darker-corners
5/6/2022,"Ihad a new anxiety dream the other night. For a few years, inexplicably, my anxiety dreams have been about Ray Davies of the Kinks (you wouldn’t believe the stress of finding him the perfect taupe polo neck before he goes on TV). The other week, though, I had a new one. I imagined a tattoo was sliding down my arm, from my shoulder to my hand, until slipping off completely and leaving a muddy, inky stain on the sheets. I had my first tattoo last October, aged 52: a large, full-colour rendering of a bird – a red kite – on my upper left arm. For years I had been one of those tutting inkphobes who didn’t understand why anyone would mutilate themselves. I would have agreed with a recent article in the Times by Melanie Phillips (paywall) in which she described tattoos as “a kind of desecration, the corruption of something that is pure, precious and the very quintessence of integrity”. Maybe not in those words, perhaps – I’d have just called them ugly – but the thought would have been the same. But something changed in middle age. Call it a midlife crisis, if you want – my sister-in-law calls it a “manopause” – but at least it was cheaper and safer than buying a Ferrari. My wife had been following tattooists on Instagram for a while, because she fancied getting ink herself. She would comment often, and approvingly, on footballers’ arm designs, ignoring the slide-rule pass that put the striker in on goal. And though I had loudly and frequently dismissed tattoos, I had started looking, too, having noticed other people’s – not in any specific way; I had no tattoo role models – and appreciated them, particularly nature-based ones. I saw the beauty in many, though not all – there are lots of tattoos I don’t like, and I promise never to have “Only God Can Judge Me” tattooed on my throat – but enough that I started to wonder how I would look with ink. Something else happened last year, though, without which I wouldn’t have made the step. I lost quite a lot of weight. I am not and will never be svelte; I will always be more comfortable with clothes that have an X on the size label, but at least I can stick to one X these days. I got rid of my belly, and some of my chins; my trousers became dramatically looser and I had to punch new holes in my belts. For the first time, I started to be pleased with the way I looked: I was able to buy nice clothes because nice clothes actually fit me. After the weight loss and the clothes, I wanted to carry on looking different from the schlub I had been, and tattoos seemed the next step. They were not armour, not protection; they were projection. For the middle-aged, tattoos seem not to be whims. They are markers of change, commemorations of events. Rebecca Vincent, whose beautiful floral line drawings have made her something of a superstar in the tattooing world – a waiting list of a year; 171,000 Instagram followers – sees a lot of middle-aged women at her London studio. “I should write a memoir with the stories I’ve heard,” she says. “People open up because they’re in a vulnerable place, and a lot of the time that first tattoo has a significant reason. Sometimes they are flowers to mark a birth; sometimes they mark a loss – a memorial tattoo. When you start getting them, they are so significant, but after two or three tattoos it becomes, ‘Ah, just have another one’.” Sometimes the very insignificance counts. Beverlie Manson, 76, a children’s book illustrator, got her first ink in her 70s, after meeting the heavily tattooed man who would become her third husband. She, too, had not been much of a fan until she saw her husband naked. “The first time he and I got our kit off, I was shocked,” she says. “But it’s so aesthetically interesting.” His tattoos were random – she mentions the words “special fried rice”, in the relevant Chinese script, inked on his leg – and she decided to follow suit, with a line heart on the front of her left shoulder. But don’t read too much into it, she says. She deliberately avoided having something connected to her art (her specialism is drawing fairies). “The idea of having something meaningful didn’t sit well.” Murray Chalmers, a 62-year-old veteran of music PR, started getting inked at 59 (friends enquired if he might regret it when he was older). Two relationships had ended, one after the other; he had moved back home to Scotland, and like me he wanted to mark change in his life. “I had spent a lot of my youth experimenting with clothes and fashion, and they are quite important but they’re ephemeral, they are transient. Tattoos are there for good.” As they did with me, they changed the way he saw himself. “Sometimes I wake up and see my arms and I can’t believe it’s me. The tattoos have become a document joining up different parts of my life. It’s an emotional commitment as well as a physical one.” I’d like to say I carefully researched everything before going under the gun. I didn’t. There’s a tattoo studio called Flamin’ Eight round the corner from my home. I Googled it, and saw Time Out had recommended it as one of London’s best studios. I went in for a consultation with one of their artists, Dale Frame, in October. We went through a selection of photos, from which he would draw a stencil. We discussed placement (good studios are reluctant to give first-timers something that can’t be covered up with clothing) and price, and I was told to have a good breakfast before coming in a couple of weeks later. Dale warned me the first tattoo would hurt. It was large, it was colour, it would take five hours, and it would be painful. To be honest, it really wasn’t – just a little uncomfortable. It turns out – forgive me for simplifying the science – that those of us blessed with ginger hair feel less skin pain than the rest of you. Something to do with pigmentation, but you’re better off asking a dermatologist. I was warned it would itch like hell as it healed (“Remember, a fresh tattoo is an open wound” is not a reassuring sentence). But it didn’t itch either (my wife, who has just had her first tattoo, of ivy tumbling down her shoulder, reports the itching is infernal). A week later I was back for a second tattoo. Then, early this year, for a third and a fourth one, each time with Dale. After the second tattoo, a friend had said: “No one gets two tattoos. They have one, or they don’t stop.” Well, we’ll see how far it goes – I like the symmetry of two on each arm – but having tattoos is an addictive feeling. Not the inking itself, which is neither here nor there to me, but seeing the ink on my skin. Goodness knows it’s not cheap, though, which might be the main barrier to my keeping on. Four tattoos is already into four figures, and I look at people covered in ink and wonder how the hell they could afford it. What I have on my body does not define me, but each piece represents some small part of my world. My first piece was the red kite, with a wingspan of around 20cm. I love red kites: it’s not that they symbolise the freedom to be on the wing, unencumbered by society or anything like that. I just love them and am fascinated by them. The third was a beautiful bare tree – one I walk past on Hampstead Heath several times a week, and had photographed (I had a tiny rendering of my cat put into a hole in the trunk, so she is on my skin for ever) – on my upper right arm. The fourth was four oak leaves, one for each member of our family, on the inside of my lower left arm. The second is the most personal, perhaps, and the hardest to explain without sounding like an idiot. It’s a small black sheep, a detail from the cover of the record Out of Step by the hardcore punk band Minor Threat. I am not a huge devotee of hardcore – I like it more than the average, but that’s not hard. Minor Threat are not my favourite band, and Out of Step is not my favourite song of theirs: it’s a defiant yawp of pride about being straight edge (“I don’t drink / Don’t smoke / Don’t fuck / At least I can fucking think!”) and the only time I was straight edge was when abstinence wasn’t a lifestyle choice but the result of being a teenager. What’s more, as a straight, white, middle-aged, middle-class man, I’m about as in step with the world as anyone could be. But I loved Minor Threat’s insane dedication to personal liberation through rock music, and the moments when I feel least trapped by my own self-consciousness have come through rock’n’roll: the times when I dance and sing and talk to strangers and come home much drunker than I really should. That little black sheep represents those moments when I can be the version of myself I enjoy most. I suppose all four tattoos do in some way, but that one matters to me more. What Melanie Phillips didn’t understand is that while, yes, it is nicer if other people like one’s tattoos, that’s absolutely not the point of them. My tattoos make me feel physically confident for the first time in my life. I don’t mean I cowered away from people – I’m 6ft 3in and I know my physical presence is big – but that I was embarrassed by being an overweight, ginger lummox. Tattoos changed that, in a huge and significant way. I do not actually care what other people think of them (my 21-year-old daughter hates them and calls them “those marks on your arms”, which makes me laugh) because they’re not for anyone else. They’re for me. And I love them.

5/6/2022,"Xi Jinping has confirmed there is no intention to turn away from China’s zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech to the country’s senior officials that also warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Addressing the seven-member politburo standing committee, China’s highest decision-making body, specifically about the Shanghai outbreak, the president said China’s response was “scientific and effective”. He told officials to “unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid”. “We have won the battle to defend Wuhan, and we will certainly be able to win the battle to defend Shanghai,” he said, according to a translation by Sinocism’s Bill Bishop. China is the last major economy still committed to a policy of containment and elimination of the virus, despite the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant, which has overwhelmed other previous zero-Covid jurisdictions. It has largely stuck to the measures employed throughout the pandemic – lockdowns, mass testing and movement restrictions based on health codes. China reported 4,696 new cases, including 4,269 in Shanghai and 70 in Beijing. Henan province, where the capital of Zhengzhou has just gone into lockdown, recorded 79. On Friday, it postponed the Asian Games, scheduled to take place in Hangzhou in September. New dates will be announced in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia said. But a weeks-long lockdown in Shanghai created a major crisis, with food shortages and delivery bottlenecks for the 25 million residents, and major business and economic impacts. It also prompted an unusual outpouring of criticism and protest, including on the merits of persisting with zero-Covid against Omicron. In his address on Thursday, Xi appeared to send a message to those wavering, saying: “We will resolutely struggle against all words and deeds that distort, doubt and deny our epidemic prevention policies.” Xi’s address also called out “problems of inadequate understanding, inadequate preparation and inadequate work [and] resolutely overcome the ideas of contempt, indifference and self-righteousness”. An analysis of the speech by the China Media Project said the language should be seen as “a direct criticism of unspecified local CCP leaders who have questioned the policies at the centre, or who have been insufficiently successful in applying them”. It added: “And it is difficult not to hear in this phrase about ‘self-righteousness’ a condemnation of leaders in Shanghai in particular.” Health experts agree with Chinese authorities that vaccination and booster rates are too low, and health resources too inequitable across regions for the country to risk opening up. However, analysts say the zero-Covid policy is now so entrenched in the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and Xi that even when conditions change there is no way out, barring a major and potentially damaging backdown. Economists have forecast a worsening economic situation if Shanghai-style lockdowns continue. One analyst this week projected it would cost $257bn, 1.5% of China’s 2021 GDP, by the end of the year if every tier-1 city employed the thrice-weekly testing regime currently operating in Beijing and other places. During the five-day labour day holiday, which ended on Thursday, there was a 43% year-on-year reduction in tourism spending. Rail journeys were down by more than 70%. In the capital, Beijing, authorities have resisted a city-wide lockdown, instead imposing movement and transport restrictions, activity and venue shutdowns, and lockdowns of individual residential compounds. It has ordered people from some districts to work from home, and reopened mass quarantine centres to house mild and asymptomatic cases.

5/6/2022,"The elephant in the room is a trinket. It is an animal ornament that catches the light with its silvery spangles. These days, it embarrasses its owner, Ella – not so much because it smacks of cultural appropriation, she being a white actor from Hebden Bridge, the elephant a symbol of the Hindu deity Ganesh. It is more because it reminds her of her 10-year-old self, a little girl entranced by the fabrics and colours of India. Played by a spirited Eva Scott, she whisks the elephant out of the way of her new boyfriend Haseeb, a north London poet. He jokingly reminds her his family is not from India – his parents were born in Pakistan – but the ornament is a small reminder of their differing cultural backgrounds. In Zia Ahmed’s romantic two-hander, previously staged at London’s Bush theatre, this literal elephant in the room becomes metaphorical. They even give it a name – André – as it expands into the space between them. Usman Nawaz, low-key and conversational as Haseeb, can’t help but project the microaggressions of a racist society on to their relationship. In turn, Ella can only feel pushed away. However hard the two try to accept each other as they are, cultural baggage weighs them down. Sometimes it is of no consequence: the perceived differences between north and south London or the familiar way people greet each other in the countryside. But where on a sliding scale of discomfort do you put cultural stereotyping or the possibility of a racist attack? Neither of them are complicit in these things – on the contrary, they actively call them out – but as they go from Christmas to Eid to Halloween, André increases in size. It is a Romeo-and-Juliet tragedy in which the lovers have internalised the Montague/Capulet schisms. Or at least, it would be if the drama were not played out on so modest a scale. Director Sameena Hussain draws attractive performances from Scott and Nawaz, even if they don’t quite win your heart. On a set by Warda Abbasi that deftly suggests railway arches, tube trains and bedrooms, theirs is a relationship without urgency. Ahmed has much to say about the insidious effects of a divided culture – but his narrative meanders where it should sting.

5/6/2022,"A plane crash in the rugged hinterlands of Canada during seemingly calm weather has prompted a federal investigation into what could have brought down the small aircraft. But revelations that two of the passengers were fleeing murder and conspiracy charges and had links to organized crime have only deepened the mystery over the doomed flight. Over the weekend, rescue crews dispatched a search plane and two helicopters to scour the boreal forest of north-western Ontario, after reports of a plane that never arrived at its intended destination. On Saturday, the debris of a small aircraft, a four-seater Piper PA-28 Cherokee, was discovered near the town of Sioux Lookout, guided by the plane’s emergency locator beacon. Neither the pilot, Abhinav Handa, nor the three passengers survived the crash. Among those onboard the plane was Gene Lahrkamp, one of the most wanted men in the country with a C$100,000 (US$78,000) bounty on his head, according to the combined forces special enforcement unit of British Columbia. Lahrkamp, a former soldier was a chief suspect in the murder of gang member Jimi Sandhu, who was shot dead while at a villa in Phuket in February. Sandhu, was born in India but raised in the British Columbia city of Abbotsford, where he joined the United Nations gang. He was deported to India in 2016 by Canadian authorities for “serious criminality”, and arrested there two years later for his role in a ketamine manufacturing operation. Thai police allege that Lahrkamp and co-conspirator Matthew Dupre, another former soldier, travelled to Thailand to kill Sandhu, whose body was found riddled with bullets. Thai police say they dressed in hooded sweatshirts and face coverings for the attack, fleeing for Canada two days after the shooting. Sandhu’s death marks the second recent shooting of a Canadian-linked gang member abroad. In January, two Toronto men linked to the Hells Angels were killed near the resort city of Playa del Carmen in Mexico. Dupre was arrested by Canadian police in late February and is awaiting extradition. An Interpol red notice for Lahrkamp warned he may be armed and dangerous, as well as possibly suicidal. Also onboard the plane was Duncan Bailey, another alleged gang member, who was facing charges of conspiracy to commit murder over a 2020 shooting in Vancouver. An arrest warrant was issued for Bailey in late April after prosecutors in British Columbia say he breached his bail conditions. The fourth person on the plane was identified as Hankun Hong, a resident of British Columbia. It is unclear if he was a co-pilot on the flight or a passenger. Images from his Facebook page show the 27-year-old piloting a small aircraft in western British Columbia. The plane left the province on 23 April, making frequent refuelling stops as it travelled east. The plane departed the town of Dryden, Ontario, on Friday, 29 April evening and was due to land in the town of Marathon, roughly 700 kilometres away. Officials have not yet said if they know where the plane was headed after its stop in Marathon, but the Ontario provincial police say they are conducting a criminal investigation into the flight and the possible links between passengers.",News/World news,Canada plane crash mystery deepens with two murder suspects among dead,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/canada-plane-crash-murder-conspiracy
5/6/2022,"“This is not a record store,” quips Emily Kokal, surveying the crowd. As artists strive to shift copies, in-store album launch shows have become something of an obligation; a short showcase of new wares generally delivered in stripped-back arrangements. Nearly two decades into their career, Warpaint make it clear that they will be doing no such thing. This is an opportunity to really revel in one another’s company, to celebrate their latest release with low-pressure intimacy and warmth. In a room of committed attendees, new cuts are welcomed greedily. They begin with origin song Stars and quickly move on to Champion, the lead single from Radiate Like This (the new album, released today). Cutting through their trademark moody grooves, it has a lovely upbeat glitter, an invitation to embrace your inner cheerleader. Melting is delivered beautifully a capella, small flickers of calypso snaking around the four-part harmony: “No more armour / no anxiety.” There are refreshingly few phones in the air, fans preferring to capture the moment in their loosening limbs. The delight of a Warpaint live show is truly in the detail. All four members seem to untie complex knots from their instruments, working with the spellbinding agility of expert Rubik’s cubers. The rhythm duo of Jenny Lee Lindberg (bass) and Stella Mozgawa (drums) are particularly accomplished, providing the sturdy current beneath Kokal’s and Theresa Wayman’s more experimental vocal/guitar waves. Old favourite Love Is to Die still elicits the biggest cheer but Disco/Very is an aptly named closer, much more dynamic live than it is on record. All good bands can learn to sound polished with time, but the communication in Warpaint feels more instinctual, a sisterly symbiosis that allows each member to shine without diminishing the lustre of the whole. It’s a difficult trick to get right, much less to perform it with this much calm and cool.  Warpaint play Metronome, Nottingham, on 6 May. Then touring to 18 May.",Arts/Music,Warpaint review – spellbinding symbiosis from a band of true agility,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/06/warpaint-review-belgrave-music-hall-leeds
