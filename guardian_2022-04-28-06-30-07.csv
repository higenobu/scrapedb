4/28/2022,"When Tan France was nine, he stole his cousin’s skin bleaching cream. It stung, like sunburn, so he didn’t use it for long. But when he was older, in his mid-teens, he decided to have another go. The shame and guilt that Queer Eye’s resident fashion expert feels about his youthful pursuit of lighter skin is the ostensible motive behind Tan France: Beauty and the Bleach (BBC Two), a celebrity-odyssey documentary that starts, as is now custom, with the obligatory suitcase-packing shot. The Doncaster-raised stylist is leaving his deluxe Utah home and returning to “musty-fusty” old England, to reckon with his feelings about skin bleaching and investigate the wider problem of colourism: the idea that fairer complexions are favoured in black and Asian communities, as well as society at large. Yet France’s journeys – literal and metaphorical – turn out to be far from straightforward. First, France hears from those affected by colourism. A magnetically warm and sensitive interviewer, he talks to Kelly Rowland of Destiny’s Child, who recalls being told she was “too dark chocolate” by a boyfriend’s grandmother, and sits down with the actor Bunmi Mojekwu, who reads out some of the shocking Twitter abuse she received while playing Mercy on EastEnders – all of it from black users. During a school visit, he comes over like a dream teacher – funny, excitable, down to earth – bonding with the children over the scourge of “aunties”, female elders who he suggests may be the modern-day gatekeepers of colourism. But exactly why these older women are so preoccupied with skin tone is never explained. Colourism is a deeply entrenched issue with a complicated past – in other words, not something easily served up by an hour-long entertainment documentary. There are attempts to delve deeper: France speaks to a professor about how colonialism and the caste system in India contributed to colourism, but it’s a brief and unclear history lesson. At one point, he observes that skin-lightening treatments are hugely popular in east Asia, but provides no further insight on the phenomenon. Whatever the precise mechanics behind contemporary colourism, it is clearly a topic worth covering: not only for the black and Asian viewers who have been harmed by such prejudice, but also for white audiences who may have little knowledge of its pressures. Yet as the show progresses, it becomes obvious that the subject under discussion doesn’t quite chime with France’s own experiences. You get the impression that experiences of colourism don’t fully explain why he hasn’t felt able to return to Doncaster town centre for 20 years. The crux of the matter is teed up with a small but heart-rending detail: in 1988, as a five-year-old, France walked to school by himself for the first time; he was chased down and beaten by a group of white men. He didn’t tell his parents, fearing he would be blamed for not running away fast enough. The image of this tiny boy being attacked by adult men is utterly appalling – and France is distraught as he recalls it. It was that incident, and others like it, that made him desperate to have lighter skin, he explains: bleaching was a form of self-protection, an attempt to disguise his race in order to avoid violence in the street. It’s also the reason why he finds it impossible to return to Doncaster, zooming straight past the motorway exit he was supposed to turn off at. Usually, this kind of issue-based documentary reaches for a redemption narrative – or at least a glimmer of hope – to end on. France’s experiences do not lend themselves to such a trajectory: he remains severely traumatised by the racism he endured, and doesn’t live in the UK any more because of it. That his testimony seems so shocking is also telling: if these stories were told more often, perhaps Britain would no longer be able to stubbornly avoid atoning for its brutally racist past. Instead of detouring down that road, the show reverts back to its original topic: colourism and how it manifests in the fashion industry. France finds that influential black editors, such as British Vogue’s Edward Enninful, are slowly improving prospects for darker-skinned models. It provides the tiniest hint of progress required to wrap things up, but it’s probably not the part of this show that will stick with you. As a survey of colourism, Beauty and the Bleach feels somewhat incomplete. As an evocation of the racist trauma this country has bestowed on so many, it is both damning and completely devastating.

4/28/2022,"Good morning. Climate policies are front and centre today, with the Greens set to launch its policy, which will push for a new levy on coal exports, and renewed climate brawling continues in the Coalition. Private schools have received an extra $10bn in “special deals” since 2018, while public schools were underfunded by at least $6.5bn every year, according to a report. The study by education economist Adam Rorris details the legacy of special treatment of private schools including $4.6bn of transitional funding after the Gonski 2.0 reforms and $750m of jobkeeper wage subsidies. Transition arrangements will see non-government schools continue to receive more than 80% of the resourcing standard until 2028. These include Haileybury in Victoria, which will get a total of $25m above that level from 2022 to 2028; Trinity grammar school in NSW with an extra $16.8m; Monte Sant’ Angelo in NSW with $15.3m; and Brisbane grammar school with $13.9m. The AEU federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said the Morrison government had “shamelessly established and consolidated a deep inequity in Australian education, to the detriment of the overwhelming majority of students who attend public schools”. The former attorney general Christian Porter rejected a plea for mercy from six Indonesians who said they were wrongly jailed as children using unreliable evidence, telling them they had no chance of success despite their lawyers pointing to a landmark ruling years earlier finding a miscarriage of justice in a similar case. Federal police policy dictated that, as children, they should have been sent home. Instead, the police relied on a flawed technique using wrist X-rays to prove their adulthood. Five of the six boys pleaded guilty after being charged as adults, meaning the evidence about their ages wasn’t tested in court. The boys were convicted and jailed in maximum security facilities, before being released and returned home to Indonesia in 2011. Vladimir Putin has warned any countries attempting to interfere in Ukraine would be met with a “lightning-fast” response from Moscow. In an address to lawmakers in St Petersburg, the Russian president said troops would use “all the tools for this – ones that no one can brag about”. Russia has warned other EU customers may be cut off from Russian natural gas supplies if they refuse to pay in roubles. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov’s comments came after Russia halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, a move that European leaders denounced as “blackmail”, which the Kremlin later denied. Only 1.6% of private rental properties in Australia are affordable for minimum wage earners and all but zero for those on benefits, Anglicare’s annual snapshot has found. The snapshot calls for a 50% rise in rent assistance payments, more social housing and changes to the tax system. The Coalition last year required big polluters to pay an estimated $15m for carbon credits, using a policy that Scott Morrison now falsely describes as “Labor’s sneaky carbon tax”. Labor has raised grave concerns about the home affairs minister’s use of “privileged access to intelligence reporting”, after Karen Andrews publicly alluded to a potential attempt by China at interference in the federal election. Homeowners in the outer suburbs of major cities are facing a “huge cliff” in coming years as their fixed-rate loans expire and they are hit with higher interest rates, analysts say. Inflation jumped in March, sparking expectations of a cash rate rise before the election. About 420 Victorian public school teachers have been stood down for failing to meet Covid vaccination requirements. Just over half had failed to get a booster shot before the March deadline. How does your area compare for housing stress, socioeconomic disadvantage and income? In the first of a series about Australian electorates, we look at inequality and wealth. Emmanuel Macron has narrowly dodged being hit by a bag of tomatoes during a surprise visit to a working-class area north of Paris, as he promised a new style of “listening to people” after his re-election as president. Prince Andrew has been stripped of his honorary freedom of the city after a unanimously decision by York city councillors, who also called on Andrew to relinquish his Duke of York title. Up to 40% of the world’s land is now classed as degraded, putting the world’s ability to feed a growing population at risk, UN data has shown. Elon Musk has engaged with tweets criticising Twitter employees despite promising not to “disparage” the company or its representatives while he completes the deal to acquire the social media platform. Susie Dee’s first work at Melbourne’s La Mama theatre was as a student in the 1970s, acting in a piece called Mangoes and Grapes. Those were the only words in the script, and the play was staged in the car park. But it was a role in a 1986 production, Lilly and May, that would shape Australian theatre for decades to come when she met young playwright Patricia Cornelius. Today, Dee and Cornelius are nearly synonymous as a theatre-making duo whose productions highlight Australia’s working class, giving voice to characters rarely highlighted on Australian stages.

So, begrudgingly, here are my 10 favourite funny vids on the web,” he says. “The latest inflation figures showing a 5.1% increase in prices over the past 12 months mean three things: the budget figures are already wrong, an interest rate rise next week is very likely, and last, workers have seen their real wages absolutely smashed,” writes Greg Jericho. “It is not unusual for budget figures to be wrong, but to be wrong after just one month takes some doing.” In 2009, during the highly charged political climate around border protection, Indonesian children were wrongly jailed in Australia as adult people smugglers. This week the Western Australia court of appeal overturned their convictions and found “a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred”. In today’s Full Story, reporter Christopher Knaus breaks down the now-discredited medical technique used by the Australian federal police to prosecute these children, and why it’s taken 12 years to have their appeal heard.

4/28/2022,"Meta shares soared in after hours trading on Wednesday, despite the company reporting slow revenue growth amid global economic uncertainties and the war in Ukraine. The company’s reported total revenue rose 7% to $27.91bn in the first quarter, the bulk of it coming from ad sales. That number missed analysts’ estimates of $28.20bn, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The report on Wednesday comes as the Facebook parent company continues a major rebrand of its products and shake-ups to its business model. Its chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, has announced the Meta will focus more heavily on the metaverse, a virtual reality platform, rather than its core social media business. Meta lost a record $230bn in market value following a disappointing earnings report in February in which it revealed that Facebook had recorded its first-ever drop in daily user numbers. The company’s first quarter earnings for 2022 represents a slight recovery, with daily active users (DAUs) on Facebook now slightly above analyst estimates. Reuters contributed to this report.

4/28/2022,"The Conservatives have been hit by yet another House of Commons sex scandal after a female minister reported seeing a male colleague watching porn on a mobile phone in parliament. A string of the party’s female MPs have complained to the whips about sexism and misogyny within its ranks in a heated meeting on Tuesday night. It comes just days after the whips said they would try to find out which Tory MPs, in an article in the Mail on Sunday, had falsely accused Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, of a “Basic Instincts” ploy to distract Boris Johnson by crossing and uncrossing her legs in parliament. Female MPs are also “on the brink of mutiny”, according to one senior Tory, over a report over the weekend that three cabinet ministers were among 56 MPs against whom complaints of sexual harassment to the independent complaints system were made. The female junior minister complained about the pornography viewing to the Commons’ chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, at a meeting of a new group for female MPs and peers – known as the 2022 – on Tuesday night. A second senior female MP also raised similar concerns about the same male MP. A whips’ office spokesperson initially said the chief whip would be “looking into this matter”. “This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken,” she said. However, later on Wednesday evening, the whips’ office said it was up to the female MPs to raise the matter officially with the independent complaints and grievance service. “Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action,” the spokesperson said. When the complaints were raised, others among the group of 40 MPs in attendance were said to have “gone ballistic”. One recalled: “We all shouted that they had to be suspended.” Another attender said: “I think chief wasn’t prepared for strength of feeling, one colleague talked about comments made on her skirt, another at being called ‘girls’ by whips, another about being sniggered at by male colleagues in chamber.” They also complained that female MPs were being sidelined, with the media dominated by senior Tory men on the morning broadcast rounds and regular television shows. The female MPs did not name the man who allegedly watched porn in the chamber during the meeting. However, there was fevered speculation in Westminster on Wednesday about the identity of the male MP. Several names circulated amid conflicting information about whether this had been a frontbencher. Female MPs across the Commons are outraged about the treatment of Rayner. But Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said on Wednesday the PM was “uncomfortable” that the Speaker had summoned the editor of the Mail on Sunday to discuss its misogynistic treatment of her. David Dillon, the newspaper’s editor, was asked to meet the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. But on Wednesday the Mail ran a response from Dillon saying he would not attend the meeting, as well as a story suggesting Rayner had joked about the comparison on previous occasions with Tory MPs as well as on a podcast. In response, Rayner hit out at claims that she had previously viewed “sexist slurs” made against her as a joke. Rayner tweeted in response: “I said … in January that the sexist film parody about me was misogynistic and it still is now. As women we sometimes try to brush aside the sexism we face, but that doesn’t make it OK. “The Mail implies today that I somehow enjoy being subjected to sexist slurs. I don’t. They are mortifying and deeply hurtful. ‘She loves it really’ is a typical excuse so many women are familiar with. But it can’t be women’s responsibility to call it out every time. I don’t need anyone to explain sexism to me – I experience it every day. “Boris Johnson gave assurances he would unleash ‘the terrors of the earth’ on the Tory MPs spreading this vile sexism. I hope to hear what he’ll be doing about it today.” Hoyle told MPs on Monday he had arranged a meeting with Dillon after an outcry over the claims in the article. Dillon said he and his political editor, Glen Owen, would not be attending as journalists should “not take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be”. The Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to consider revoking the Commons pass of the article’s author. However, Hoyle, who met Rayner on Monday, suggested it would not be right to remove his pass.",News/Politics,Tories hit by another scandal after MP accused of watching porn in Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/female-mps-demand-suspension-of-accused-porn-watcher-in-house-of-commons
