1/5/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government is preparing to declare a quasi-state of emergency in the southern island prefecture of Okinawa due to a spike in the number of coronavirus cases, perhaps as early as this week, the Mainichi daily said on Wednesday. It would be the first such declaration since Sept. 30, when Japan lifted all states of emergency and quasi-emergency that had been in effect for a good part of 2021. The number of new daily coronavirus cases in Japan rose past 1,000 on Tuesday for the first time in three months, with 225 cases in Okinawa making it one of the worst-hit part of the nation. The Mainichi said Okinawa governor Denny Tamaki told Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno on Tuesday that he was considering requesting a quasi-emergency state, which would include measures such as limiting the opening hours of restaurants and bars. Matsuno had said the government would respond promptly, the newspaper reported. No further details were given. Okinawa has entered the ""sixth wave"" of the coronavirus, Tamaki told reporters on Tuesday, noting the highly transmissible Omicron variant's role in the spread of infections. The 225 virus cases on Tuesday were Okinawa's highest in more than three months, Tamaki said, adding that infections inside U.S. military bases in the prefecture continued to increase.

1/5/2022,"A 31-year-old father was charged with assault and accused of shoving a referee to the ground during his son’s eighth-grade basketball game in Washington, deputies said. The 72-year-old referee broke his nose and cheek during the fall at the Dec. 16 game at Kenmore Middle School, King County sheriff’s deputies said in a probable cause statement. The father pleaded not guilty to the second-degree assault charge on Jan. 3, the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said. McClatchy News is not naming the father to protect his child’s identity. During the game, the man’s son caused a foul on another player so one referee got in between the players and tried to grab the man’s son, causing him to fall, deputies said after reviewing a video of the incident. Then the father ran onto the basketball court and rammed a 72-year-old referee to the ground from behind who was not involved in separating the two players, deputies said. The referee fell on his face, breaking his nose and cheek. Deputies said his nose bled for over an hour so medical responders took him to a Seattle hospital. Meanwhile, deputies said the father, screaming, grabbed his son off the court and left. He was released from jail on Dec. 18 after posting bail, which was set at $20,000. His next court hearing is Feb. 17.
