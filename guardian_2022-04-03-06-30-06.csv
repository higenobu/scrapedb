4/3/2022,"The losses at Everton have not just been confined to the pitch. With their Premier League status increasingly imperilled, they announced a third successive annual deficit of more than £100m thislast week. Rarely has so much been spent to accomplish so little and if some speculate to accumulate, the danger is that Everton have speculated to relegate. A glimpse at a team with 15 defeats in 20 Premier League games can prompt questions about where the money has gone. Everton have the worst away record this season and the fewest points in the past six months even though around £550m has been spent on transfers during Farhad Moshiri’s largely ill-fated reign as owner. The School of Science has scarcely specialised in mathematics. The numbers have not added up. If Everton’s 68-year stay in the top flight comes to an end, the signings will be a reason for a historic slide. Alex Iwobi’s £28m fee makes him the fourth-most expensive arrival in Everton’s history and there was an element of understatement from the Nigerian when he was asked to describe his time at Goodison Park. “I feel it could always improve,” he says. There are more strident verdicts. He has been branded a waste of money. But if Everton have had precious little return on their investment, Iwobi may have scored the most important goal of their season. His winner against Newcastle, when Everton were down to 10 men in a game delayed because a protester had tied himself to a goalpost, provoked such delirium that Frank Lampard broke his hand but did not notice at first. “It was crazy, the scenes were amazing,” Iwobi says. “It was one of those feelings you wish never disappears.” If that strike may prove pivotal in keeping Everton up, three days later they lost 4-0 to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup. Their season seemed distilled into two games: one step forward, a bigger one back. It prompted Lampard to accuse his charges of lacking the necessary “bollocks”. Iwobi agrees, albeit in more measured words. A capacity to capitulate predates Everton’s latest manager. “It comes from within us,” he says. “We know that sometimes we don’t give the fight that we’re capable of giving. Even before Frank came, we were saying we had to show more character. Our away form has not been great. I feel it is a mental thing.” Some of the lows have come in the capital and, after March also brought a 5-0 thrashing at Tottenham, London is calling again. Sunday’s trip to West Ham is a reminder of Everton’s past and a vision of an alternative existence. The Hammers now seem to enjoy the annual top-eight finishes David Moyes brought to Goodison Park. While Everton have appointed Champions League-winning managers in 2019 and 2021 and a Champions League-winning player in 2022, West Ham may be heading for a European final soon. That Moyes was interested in returning to Merseyside when Marco Silva was sacked suggests this season could have been more triumphant than traumatic. Instead, Everton took the more glamorous option and then veered from Carlo Ancelotti to Rafael Benítez to Lampard. Iwobi has scored one league goal for each of the four supposedly permanent managers to pick him. If that meagre return implies he is part of the problem, he can also look collateral damage, a victim of changing plans, shunted in, around and out of the side. Iwobi’s £28m fee is similar to Moyes’s net spend across his 11 years on Merseyside. Nine years after he left, the greatest advertisement for Moyesian thrift remains. Séamus Coleman’s £65,000 fee means he stands out even among the other bargains. While the £28m pair of full-backs Everton bought in January, Nathan Patterson and Vitalii Mykolenko, are likelier to be on the bench at the London Stadium and look like the latest indictment of scattergun spending, Coleman carries on as captain, starter and motivator. A survivor of happier times has taken on additional duties trying to help Everton stay up. “The one thing Séamus is always telling us is that we’ve got to keep on fighting and giving 100%,” Iwobi says. “Whenever we’ve done that, it doesn’t matter which manager we fight under, we’ve normally been able to get results. “Every time I have heard negativity it gives me that hunger and desire to try and prove people wrong, and Séamus was saying this should give us the hunger and the will to go and fight for our club and show that Everton’s not soft, that Everton’s not going down.” Perhaps the straight-talking Coleman has been a rarity in highlighting the threat on the horizon. “I won’t lie, it has been mentioned once or twice but if relegation does get mentioned, it doesn’t get mentioned a lot,” says Iwobi. For a club whose wage bill peaked at £182m last season, who are building a £500m stadium and who over the past six seasons, have spent more on transfers than Real Madrid and Liverpool it would be the most chastening and costly of demotions. Iwobi says: “We know what is at stake.”",Sport/Football,Speculate to relegate?

4/3/2022,"Matt Doherty does not hesitate when asked to recall the time things sunk to their lowest. It was March 2021: Spurs were travelling to Aston Villa on the back of a defeat to Arsenal and a humiliation for the ages at Dinamo Zagreb. Although he was not involved in the latter, Doherty knew he had not performed well at the Emirates, but it still came as a surprise to find himself José Mourinho’s fall guy next time out. He was in the 21-strong travelling party but the ignominy hit hardest when, with the youngsters Alfie Devine and Dane Scarlett named as substitutes, he was forced to stay in the car park. “I went to get off the bus and it was Covid at the time, so you weren’t allowed in the changing room if you weren’t in the squad. Ledley [King], who was the assistant coach, was like: ‘You’ve got to stay on the bus.’ Once the game started I was allowed to go into the stands. “So now I was just sat on the bus on my own. Genuinely, because it was the international break straight after, I was so close to just getting in the car and going. I think [Republic of Ireland] were meeting in Manchester anyway. I didn’t in the end, I decided I’d stay and watch the game and then go.” Had a hurt, frustrated Doherty let heart rule head, perhaps his Tottenham career would be over by now. “I’m glad I didn’t,” he says. “It’s just not professional, is it, to do that? In your head you’re sitting on the bus and thinking: ‘What’s the point in watching the game? I might as well go.’ There were kids, and that’s no disrespect to kids, on the bench. [Mourinho] was trying to prove a point to everybody, not just for me but for the players who weren’t there either, but it was not fun.” It has not exactly been a laugh a minute in the subsequent 13 months, even since Mourinho’s departure, but against many expectations Doherty’s prospects have been transformed. Before the new year, he had played 99 minutes of Premier League football and his starts had been limited almost entirely to the Europa Conference League. Everything changed at the end of February when Spurs demolished Leeds and Doherty showed the expressive instinct that had seemingly deserted him to spring 70 yards up the field and sweep an accomplished opening goal – his first for the club – past Illan Meslier. Since then he has been Antonio Conte’s right wing-back and Sunday’s meeting with Newcastle should offer a seventh straight outing from the beginning. Spurs lost at Burnley before the visit to Elland Road; Conte’s dissatisfaction afforded Doherty a recall and this time he benefited from a manager’s decision to make changes. “I always judge my game off what I do offensively,” he says. “It took a long time to get my first goal for Tottenham. When I got that I felt really confident and that confidence level has stayed.” Nine days later, Doherty provided two fine assists for Harry Kane against Everton. Spurs are now seeing the player they thought they had bought from Wolves in August 2020: an intelligent, incisive marauder from deep positions on the flank. He might have expected to blossom sooner in north London: it certainly felt strange he received so few opportunities under Nuno Espírito Santo, who oversaw much of his best form at Molineux, although the ex-manager’s decision to field a back four did not help. “It’s always tough when you leave one place with a manager and then he ends up coming to the place that you’re at,” he says. “You just never know how you’re going to pick up the relationship from before. Me and him got on really well at Wolves. When he came in, I did think I would have a better chance than most because he already knows my game. For some reason it just didn’t work out.” They could not recapture the old magic and it would hardly have been a surprise, upon Conte’s arrival, to see Doherty move on even if the Italian’s liking for creative wing-backs is well known. Doherty had simply not done enough at Spurs but sensed an opportunity. “You know the formation he wants to play but you still have to gain his trust,” he says. “I didn’t play at the start: I just kept my head down, trained as hard as I could, did whatever I could in training and I think he saw I was fit all the time, I wasn’t picking up injuries. Even then I was in and out and then against Leeds I nailed it down and have been in ever since.” From that dark afternoon on the bus, Doherty has reached a position when he can help drive Spurs’ reinvigorated quest for the top four.",Sport/Football,Revitalised Matt Doherty driving Spurs’ bid for the top four,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/02/revitalised-matt-doherty-driving-spurs-bid-for-the-top-four
