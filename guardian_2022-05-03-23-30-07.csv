5/3/2022,"A leading neurologist who treated the Dorset teenager Gaia Pope has told an inquest jury there is a “failure of communication” within the NHS after revealing he was not informed her mental health had declined shortly before she died. Matthew Walker, a professor of neurology at University College London, accepted that a chance to review Pope’s care when she was taken to hospital after a psychiatric episode a few weeks before her death was missed because the hospital did not contact him. He told the jury in Bournemouth that hospital electronic records were not always compatible and GP surgeries, which used to operate as a useful information hub, were too stretched to do this effectively. Asked by the senior coroner for Dorset, Rachael Griffin, if better communication could lead to improved care and prevent future deaths, he said: “There is a general lack of communication throughout the NHS.” Later he repeated: “There is generally a failure of communication within the NHS.” Pope, 19, is believed to have died of hypothermia after burrowing into undergrowth on a clifftop or falling into the bushes after disappearing from Swanage and may have been experiencing an epileptic seizure or mental health episode at the time, the jury has heard. The teenager was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after reporting being raped at the age of 16, and shortly before she died a man had sent her indecent images, which caused flashbacks and anxiety. For the first time on Tuesday, the jury heard she was allegedly drugged with ketamine before being sexually assaulted. Walker said he first saw Pope on 15 March 2017 after her family sought a second opinion on the teenager’s epilepsy. She told him she had five to 10 seizures daily that induced a feeling of intense fear, rendered her speechless and caused her to lose touch with her surroundings. She also had “tonic clonic” seizures, which often involve a person falling unconscious, and memory loss. Walker told the inquest Pope’s epilepsy was complex and relatively rare and he began exploring the possibility of her undergoing surgery. In July 2017 she underwent tests that look at the function of the brain in hospital, but between then and her death in November 2017 neither Walker nor the epilepsy nurses he worked with spoke to Pope. The coroner said the lack of contact “concerned her”. Walker said he “assumed” she was still in contact with local epilepsy services. Griffin told the doctor: “It is dangerous to assume things,” and asked him to clarify if Pope had been under his care from 15 March onwards. He replied she was. Walker said he knew that Pope had mental health issues, which can exacerbate epilepsy. But he told the jury he did not hear that in October 2017 – the month before her death – she had been taken to hospital and was so disturbed that she underwent an assessment to decide if she should be detained under the Mental Health Act. He said he would have liked to have been contacted by the hospital and, if he had been, would have reviewed Pope’s care. Asked by the coroner if this was a “missed opportunity” to look again at her care, Walker replied: “Absolutely.” He said one problem was that organisations had different electronic records which were not always compatible. “There is a significant problem,” he said. Walker also said that in the past GPs had been “useful hub” through which different teams could communicate, but this had eroded over the last decade. “They don’t have the time or resources to manage that. There has been a failure of that system.” The coroner said she was “significantly concerned” about how epilepsy and mental health experts worked together. Walker said better communication would save lives. The court heard that also in October 2017 a social worker had tried to get in touch with Walker about Pope but sent the message to the wrong email address. Asked by the coroner if this would have triggered contact with Pope to review her care, he replied: “Yes.” The inquest continues.

5/3/2022,"Elspeth Barker’s first and only novel, O Caledonia, was once described by the novelist Ali Smith as “the best least-known novel of the 20th century”. But in 2021, 30 years after its first publication – and a year before the author’s death at the age of 81 – it was reissued by Weidenfeld & Nicolson and found its place as a modern classic of Scottish literature. The book has achieved international success and will be published this September by Scribner in the US and is set to appear in France, Spain (and also in Catalonia), Estonia and Italy. The novel tells the glittering, darkly funny story of the short life of a young girl, Janet, who lives in a bleak Scottish castle, calls her cats subjunctives, keeps a jackdaw as a pet and learns poetry by heart. The only bright spot in her life is her risque Cousin Lila, whose room rattles with empty whisky bottles and smells of Schiaparelli’s Shocking and Craven A cigarettes. While the novel’s literary forebears are Emily Brontë and Walter Scott, it is more akin to Dodie Smith’s I Capture the Castle, and the Big House novels of Molly Keane. Clever, awkward Janet is in many ways a manifestation of Elspeth as a child, and Cousin Lila perhaps a manifestation of her adult self. But the novel is much more than simply a delightful coming-of-age novel, for it is original, poetic and passionate, a hymn to the importance of nature, books and the imagination. I was a publisher at Virago Press in the late 1980s and one of my authors, the author Raffaella Barker, Elspeth’s daughter, suggested to me that her mother should write a novel. On the strength of a few pages of vivid, lyrical and funny prose I commissioned her and took the book with me to Hamish Hamilton, where it was published in 1991. It won four literary awards including the Winifred Holtby prize and was shortlisted for the Whitbread first novel prize. Elspeth was 51 when her novel appeared, and she and I went on the road together, travelling from one prize ceremony and literary festival to another. She was an appalling backseat driver, sitting behind me, whimpering and exclaiming as I drove her around Britain. At the Hay festival we stayed in a particularly dismal B&B garlanded with notices forbidding us to wash our knickers. We drank red wine out of teacups and smoked so many cigarettes we set off the smoke alarm, at which Elspeth flung herself under her bed leaving me to deal with our landlady. Wild, beautiful, erudite and very funny, Elspeth shone at every occasion. At a large dinner I hosted that year in a Polish cafe in Hampstead, Joseph Brodsky and Clive James, long mutual admirers, had finally met. All evening they sat together quoting poetry to each other. Further down the table was Elspeth. Tiring of this male display of intellect and memory, she banged the table and to their astonishment began quoting poetry in Latin and ancient Greek. When she and I left, she flagged down a police car and persuaded the occupants to drive us home. Born Elspeth Langlands in Edinburgh, Elspeth was brought up in the neo-gothic Drumtochty castle, Aberdeenshire, rumoured to have been purchased from the King of Norway. The castle was the site of a prep school run by her parents, Elizabeth and Robert Langlands. Like her heroine, a bookish child with an early passion for the classics, Elspeth describes in her novel the hell of being surrounded by boys who pulled her plaits on the rugby pitch, hurled cricket balls at her head and punched her tender adolescent chest. She escaped to a boarding school, St Leonard’s, in St Andrew’s, Fife, and went on to study modern languages at Somerville College, Oxford. Elspeth fell asleep in her final exam. Later she was out drinking champagne and messing about in boats with friends, little realising her father had persuaded the principal to allow her to re-sit. Her failure to attend the additional exam resulted in her possessions being bagged up and her room cleared. She was sent down that very day with no degree, ending up in a bedsit in London, where she boiled eggs by holding a hot iron upside down with a saucepan on top. When Elspeth was 22, Elizabeth Smart, the author of By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept, introduced her to her former lover the poet George Barker. Elspeth became what she described as a “co-wife” with Elizabeth. Both women had fallen in love with Barker’s poetry before meeting him, and both it turned out were to write just one novel in their lifetimes, novels that have endured for decades. Elspeth and George set up home in a 17th-century farmhouse in Itteringham, Norfolk in the 60s. Bintry House was owned by the National Trust and had a peppercorn rent. They had five children, the final five of George’s 15. (They were to marry much later, in 1989, unable to do so until after the death of George’s first wife, Jessica, a Roman Catholic, who had refused to divorce him.)Theirs was a life of old bohemia, considerable chaos and constant visitors on the infamous and sometimes violent Saturday drinking nights. “People wanted to sit next to him.” Elspeth said, “Then they knew they wouldn’t have anything thrown at them.” George was preoccupied with being a poet, so it was Elspeth who went out to work. She taught classics at Runton Hill school for girls where she wrote and produced plays in Latin with her pupils. It was not until she was nearly 50 with grownup children that her book was commissioned. On publication the journalist Lynn Barber arranged to go to Bintry House to interview her. Lynn was known for the demolition of many of her subjects and most authors were too frightened even to meet her. “Whatever you do,” I instructed Elspeth, “don’t drink until she’s left.” Regardless, they drank a couple of bottles of red wine and fell into each other’s arms, after which Lynn wrote a vivid and loving portrait of Elspeth. Shortly after the publication of O Caledonia George Barker died. Unaware of his recent death, John Carey wrote something slighting about George’s poetry in the Sunday Times. At the Sunday Times Christmas party in the Reform Club, Elspeth stormed up to him and spat out a curse in rhyming couplets ending with the words: “Be Wary, Carey.” After George’s death, Elspeth became a regular contributor to the Independent on Sunday, writing witty, clever pieces about such subjects as her beloved pot-bellied pig Portia who took up residence under her kitchen table. She contributed to the London Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement, the Guardian and Observer. Harpers & Queen sent her and the writer Caroline Blackwood on a trip where they drank and laughed and wept their way around the battlefields of the Somme, contemplating the fallen young men. She taught creative writing at Norwich University of the Arts with the poet George Szirtes and was a regular tutor at the Arvon Foundation with her friend Barbara Trapido. It was there they met the young Maggie O’Farrell and spotted her talent; O’Farrell wrote an introduction to the 2021 reissue of O Caledonia. In 1997 Elspeth published Loss: An Anthology, with extracts ranging from Ecclesiastes, Ovid and Horace, through Ben Jonson, John Donne, Rilke, Yeats and Housman, to Dylan Thomas, Sylvia Plath and Carol Ann Duffy, and finally a short piece by her daughter Raffaella, about her father’s funeral. In 2012 her selected journalism, Dog Days, appeared. Elspeth was married for a second time, to Bill Troop, in 2007; they divorced six years later. She remained at Bintry. Her daughters lived nearby and there were always one or two of her sons and a lot of animals in residence. She spent her final months in a local care home, where she held court with characteristic charm and style. She is survived by her five children, Raffaella, Progles, Bruddy, Sam and Lily, and five grandchildren, Roman, Lorne, Esme, Ollie and Felix.

5/3/2022,"Iwent to see a play for the second time recently and changed my mind about it. If that sounds like an innocent statement in itself, it is surely a mea culpa for a critic who delivered a damning star-rated judgment the first time around. Or is it? The production was Ryan Calais Cameron’s For Black Boys Who Have Considered Suicide When the Hue Gets Too Heavy, which is currently at the Royal Court. I reviewed it in October 2021, when it was first mounted at the New Diorama theatre, and I was unequivocally disappointed. All the more so because I was sure I was going to like it, having been blown away by Cameron’s previous drama, Typical, streamed during lockdown. That play drew on the last day in the life of Christopher Alder, and I was so moved by its story, so exhilarated by its language, that it took me several cups of tea to calm down afterwards. For Black Boys … is an ensemble piece about masculinity – the ways in which young Black British men can be reduced on a daily basis and the effects of this othering. I read the script before watching it and saw its power on the page. But in its original incarnation, it looked to me like a play in need of serious development, as I wrote in my review. Does my change of mind, on second viewing, render me a flibbertigibbet whose critical judgment changes with the wind? In my defence, the Royal Court itself said Cameron’s play had been considerably developed since last autumn and what I saw last week looked like a different show in many respects. While the cast remains the same, Cameron now co-directs the production with Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu (its original director). The lighting is astounding. So is the choreography. Lines are spoken with poise and power. The entire thing is well-paced, sharply comic, full of pain and beauty. Dramaturgically it is remarkable to see how far a show can come in its development. This is ultimate proof that a two-star show has the potential to be a five-star hit if it is given the time and resources. Brilliant young playwrights should be allowed to fail too, as the writer Samuel Bailey recently pointed out to me (he is also a fan of Cameron’s work). In this instance, Cameron has not failed better but blown the roof off. Still, a part of me wonders why some theatres invite in the critics when a show is clearly still working itself into being, especially one by an emerging playwright for whom a review might be defining. By contrast, I have been asked to some opening nights on the proviso that I don’t review the show, either because it is still developing, as in the case of the Young Vic’s excellent experiment AI, or because of its urgent subject matter, such as the Royal Court’s Maryland, which dealt with violence against women, in the aftermath of the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa, and felt as much like a piece of activism as theatre. That is something theatres could do more often to protect young writers. But to return to the incriminated critic and my apologia: if a critic changes their mind, do they discredit themselves? No, because theatre reviewing is by its nature only ever an overnight response. A quick and dirty critical tradition, it is a very different proposition to book reviewing, for instance, where critics are given days, if not weeks, to formulate their views. Theatre reviewing is a more gut reaction, less penetrating because of its narrow deadline. Some of the best plays defy easy reductions of their meanings and there are many shows whose themes I have not managed to fully unpick in the allotted 12 hours or so after coming out of the theatre. What frustrates me the most are my memories of plays that rise up, refusing to be forgotten, for shows which might have been imperfect but should have been allotted the full five stars: Pass Over, Wise Children, Notes from the Field, Shedding a Skin. Imperfection, I have realised, is no bar to brilliance. Of course star ratings can swing the other way too: I disliked Jez Butterworth’s Jerusalem when I saw it in 2009; the casual racism and misogynistic bile spilling out of the mouths of the characters at the start alienated me and I did not remain open to the magic of the play’s other two acts which I only recognised in its current revival. The play still riles me for the same reasons – as well as a sense that it glories in insularity and sentimentalises a certain kind of Britishness – but I can better appreciate its craft and performance the second time around. Second viewings are intimidating because they put our initial judgments to the test. Will we like the play, film or book as much or as little as we did or were we “wrong” the first time around? Neil Gaiman recently said he finds it hard to read Enid Blyton to his children which is “weird because I remember just how much I loved Blyton”. Whatever he adored then, he said, is no longer there now. For many decades, I considered Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights my favourite novel, based on a first and only reading at the age of 15. My reluctance to re-read it over subsequent decades was out of fear I may have got it wrong as a teenager, and that I couldn’t trust the judgment of that younger self. But when I did pick it up again, in my 40s, I loved it for many of the same reasons – its outsider spirit, dark romance and wildness – as well as some new ones. It is a reminder, for me at least, that what we liked the first time around is usually what we will like the second and third time, and that the first response is a valid one, even under pressure of a deadline. But Gaiman is proof that not everyone is the same and Cameron shows us that some work has a magnificent capacity to transform, so the critic’s opinion must follow.

5/3/2022,"Residents in several neighbourhoods in northern Rome have imposed a nightly “curfew” after a spate of attacks by wild boar, which for years have roamed the Italian capital. In the most recent encounter, a woman said a boar “was on top of my head” after she was pushed to the ground during an attack on Sunday night. The incident prompted exasperated residents of Balduina and six other districts to impose an 8.30pm curfew. “On the [social media] chats between people in the district, and especially in group chats between people who have dogs, it is advised not to go out after 8.30pm,” Gianluca Sabino, a Balduina resident, told La Repubblica newspaper. “Because at night, if somebody falls over or is hurt and nobody is around to help, then they could remain on the ground for who knows how long.” Franco Quaranta, the president of a residents’ activist group in Aurelio, described the curfew as an act of “self-protection” by citizens because the authorities had failed to take effective measures. “This time the victim was an adult – but what if it happens to a child? With [the boars’] teeth, even just a bite to the leg is enough to jeopardise someone’s life,” he said. Giovanni Mantovani, who runs a similar organisation in Monte Mario, said: “These animals are getting closer and closer to people, and it’s not just at night – they are walking the streets at all hours of the day.” The latest victim was Marta Santangelo, a psychotherapist, who was attacked by a boar beside a bin while walking her dog. “It was just before 11pm … I was carrying a bag of rubbish and by the bin I noticed boar cubs. The mother was fixating on me. I understood that maybe she was scared and so picked up my dog and ran for cover.” This article includes content hosted on theguardian..

But as she tried to flee, Santangelo said she was attacked by the mother boar and fell to the ground. “She was on my head … I screamed and my dog defended me. There were seven piglets close by but they didn’t attack.” Santangelo was picked up by a motorist and taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries to her face and knee. In response to the attack, Rome authorities announced anti-boar measures, including fencing-off areas of natural park where the animals enter the city, and regularly collecting rubbish, particularly bins in areas close to the animals’ main entrance points. Massimo Vetturi, the director of the wild animals unit at the animal rights organisation LAV, said boar attacked humans only if they felt there was a threat to their offspring or source of food. “These are the two critical elements that can unleash an attack, from any wild animal, not just boar,” he said. “But if a boar is close to an overflowing bin and a human approaches, it will act in a way to remove the threat to its essential food source. The real problem in Rome is that there has been no management of the problem.”",News/World news,Rome residents impose curfew after spate of wild boar attacks,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/rome-residents-curfew-wild-boar-attacks
5/3/2022,"Legal challenges to the policy of deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda could be a reason why the plan has not yet, as intended, started to deter unofficial Channel crossings, Downing Street has said. After a period without significant numbers of crossings amid bad weather, several hundred of people made the journey in recent days, bringing the total to more than 7,000 so far this year. It is the first time this has happened since the passing of the nationalities and borders bill, which set out the policy framework. Asked if Boris Johnson was disappointed the plan had not as yet deterred such crossings, the prime minister’s official spokesperson said that a series of legal challenges to the plan could be part of the reason. Asked when it would be possible to know if the policy was working, he said: “I don’t think there’s a fixed date. Obviously, there are a number of variables we need to deal with, not least some of the legal challenges which have been talked about.” Questioned on whether he believed would-be asylum seekers in France were reading about the legal cases and thus deciding to risk the crossing, he said: “I’m not seeking to prescribe motivation to individuals. I’m simply setting out some of the challenges that this policy has, that we expected from the start. And that’s what we’re seeing.” Under the plan, people who arrive in the UK via unofficial routes, such as on small boats crossing the Channel, could be deported to Rwanda. Their asylum claims would then be assessed with a view to remaining in the African country, with no prospect of living in the UK. In one pre-action letter sent to the Home Office, which is likely to lead to a judicial review claim, the solicitors Leigh Day stated that the charity Freedom from Torture “has serious concerns about the lawfulness of the policy”. It has requested “disclosure of information regarding the policy”, including documents outlining it, risk assessments and the memorandum of understanding signed by the UK and Rwandan governments. When the policy was announced, the stated plan was for the first deportation flights to leave by the end of May. Asked about the timetable, Johnson’s spokesperson said this had slipped. He said: “We still aim to have the first flights leave in a matter of months, but because of some of those challenges it’s hard to put an exact time on it.” The plan was, he said, “to move ahead with this as soon as possible”, but the government was “not unexpectedly seeing some of these legal challenges, and in a free and democratic society we need to engage with those in the normal way. But we are still planning to move ahead with the flights at the earliest opportunity.”",News/UK news,"Legal cases may explain why Rwanda plan is not working, suggests No 10",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/03/legal-cases-may-explain-why-rwanda-plan-is-not-working-suggests-no-10
5/3/2022,"An American girl born this week will have fewer rights than an American girl born in 1973. This is the likely import of the leaked US supreme court draft opinion on abortion rights – and cause for a huge thank-you-very-much to all those guys who suggested that women marching on Washington in January 2017 were “overreacting” to the election of Donald Trump. Please make sure to tell women again when they are being overemotional – even as they sit and watch one of Trump’s justice picks scream and sob his way through his own confirmation hearings. In the meantime, resign yourself to yet another “quirk” of the looking-glass world Trump has created. Of course – OF COURSE – women’s access to abortion would end up being restricted or removed by the deliberate decisions of a man widely imagined to have personally helped to keep the Manhattan abortion sector afloat for decades. I’m kidding, of course! We have absolutely no idea whether abortion services have or haven’t ever been accessed by anyone connected with a draft-avoider who described avoiding STDs in the 80s as “my personal Vietnam”. “That’s an interesting question,” Trump replied to the New York Times when asked, during the 2016 campaign, if he’d ever been involved with a woman who had undergone a termination during their relationship. “What’s your next question?” It must be nice for reproductive rights to be an “interesting question” you have absolutely no interest in answering. As ever, it feels as the levers of power are pulled by those with no skin in the game at the expense of those with an entire uterus in it. Once again, then, a huge bravo to all the extremely rational guys whose “conscience” simply declined to permit them to vote for Hillary Clinton, on the basis that she and Trump were basically “the same”. Women now facing same-old same-old prospects like forced birth and wildly increased medical risks can only thank you and your consciences for doing the hard intellectual yards so they don’t have to. When news of the supreme court draft opinion broke last night, Clinton stated: “This decision is a direct assault on the dignity, rights, & lives of women, not to mention decades of settled law. It will kill and subjugate women even as a vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal. What an utter disgrace.” We’ve yet to hear Trump’s response – very, very samey, I imagine – so let’s use as placeholder his 2011 statement on the subject: “I am pro-life, and pro-life people will find out that I will be very loyal to them, just as I am loyal to other people. I would be appointing judges that feel the way I feel.” Can’t believe he ended up appointing pro-life judges. If only there’d been some clue his daffy media cheerleaders could have latched on to. For those whose interest in reproductive rights is not cerebral but personal and physical – that is, women – there’s a mirthless laugh to be had at some of the reaction to the leak. A lot of people are infinitely more horrified by the supreme court’s information security lapse than they are by the information itself. Please take time to appreciate the angry ranting of rightwing pundits who cannot believe the justices’ right to make private decisions has been appallingly violated, and that the fricking LEAK is “the gravest, most unforgivable sin”. Their court, their choice, OK? Out there in the real world beyond, we know from experience abortions will still happen, whether they are outlawed or not – by some accounts, pretty much the same number of abortions. But illegal abortions will mean that many more women will die from the procedure, which is a funny way of being “pro-life”. But there we are. And of course, should this seismic ruling come to pass, it will only be the start of it, with a number of other rights now under threat again. Marriage rights, contraception, racial freedom – you’d need to be a gullible fool or highly paid star news commentator to think assaults on these aren’t all on the table again. During her confirmation hearings, Amy Coney Barrett wouldn’t even say if she thought IVF treatment was constitutional, which gives you a sense of how deeply backward things could be starting to get. Yet, in some ways, it’s the things that actually were said during the confirmation hearings that illustrate the rot most clearly, with Trump’s new justices saying a lot of stuff that now turns out to have meant about as much as one of his promises. We’re looking at a court where justices are no longer particularly different from politicians – both will say any old shit to get elected or confirmed. In the infrequently lucid moments that peppered his truly deranged performance during his confirmation hearings, Brett Kavanaugh suggested Roe v Wade was settled law, that has been affirmed down the decades by “precedent on precedent”. And now look. I wonder what else in his confirmation hearings he might not have been being entirely candid about. For her part, Coney Barrett assured senators her own personal beliefs were absolutely irrelevant, and in no way likely to lead to the undoing of laws, joking: “It’s not the law of Amy. It’s the law of the American people.” It’s looking quite like the law of Amy today, all things considered. As the highly predictable majority opinion on Roe v Wade makes landfall, then, spare a thought for supposedly pro-choice Republican senator Susan Collins, who held the deciding vote on Kavanaugh, and who was apparently absolutely satisfied after two long private meetings with him back in 2018 that Roe was safe in his hands. “I’m not naive,” she explained. Susan: it seems like you’re sensationally, historically, implausibly naive. So here we are again. Today, there is a sense that even restating the arguments feels like something pro-choice women have been doing every day of every decade since they apparently won the argument. We can all understand the political imperative to talk of Roe v Wade as “settled law”, but the honest assessment from most pro-choice American women you care to talk to is that it has never felt truly settled. Women’s rights and autonomies should be their inheritance; instead, they’re just another rented thing they could be evicted from or priced out of at any moment. Far from being “liberated”, American women are in an abusive relationship with partisan lawmakers in which no sense of security is even close to permanent, and nothing is given that cannot be taken away at any point. Abortion rights have never been allowed to feel like a life goal achieved. Instead, defending them has remained a hugely consuming way of life for a huge number of women. What a vast, intensely limiting drain on their energy and human potential, which is presumably the attraction for those who seek to keep them down. You can be “pro-life”, or pro-living – but you can’t be both.

5/3/2022,"Amid a global economic downturn and worsening inflation in America, critics had described the theme for this year’s Met Gala – Gilded Glamour and White Tie – as “out of touch”. Though one might argue it was incredibly apt; poverty was rife in late-19th century New York, even while elites on the Upper East Side continued to hold “patriarch balls”, in order to create “a circle of elite New Yorkers at the top of the city’s social hierarchy”, as Sven Beckert wrote in his 2003 book The Monied Metropolis. It was Mark Twain who coined the term The Gilded Age in his 1873 work The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today. Twain’s novel was a satire of the greed and corruption that pervaded a time when some Americans successfully pursued the American dream to become very rich very quickly, while others lived in poverty. The title was a nod to the thin gold gilding that Twain said made the era seem more golden than it was. The Met Gala theme presented an opportunity for guests to emulate Twain’s commentary, or bring it up to date for today, yet the opportunity was almost unanimously bypassed. Riz Ahmed was the one attendee to notably acknowledge the wealth disparities of the Gilded Age era, telling the press that his outfit was “a love letter to those blue collar workers, those immigrant workers” who kept the country running during the period. Kim Kardashian paid a sort of fitting tribute, wearing the dress Marilyn Monroe wore when she sang “happy birthday Mr President” to John F Kennedy Jr, which was auctioned in 2016 for $4.8m. It’s a dress so expensive, none of the previous owners could wear it and even Kardashian had to remove it once she got to the top of the stairs and get into a replica, one might even say gilded, version. But that was sort of it. There were a few other nods to inequality, mostly from politicians themselves. Hillary Clinton made her first appearance at the Met Gala in two decades, wearing a Joseph Altuzarra gown with the names of 60 historic women sewn subtly into the fabric, including Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks. A relatively pared-down look when compared to Congresswoman Carolyn B Maloney’s bold “equal rights for women” dress in 2021. Meanwhile New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, wore a black tuxedo designed by the Brooklyn-based artist Laolu Senbanjo and embroidered with “end gun violence”. The outfit sparked widespread criticism online given the mayor’s emphasis on increasing policing in the city: according to the NYPD, in March 2022 New York City reported 115 shootings in comparison to 99 shootings reported in March 2021. Just met @NYCMayor at the Met Gala after party !! 😍 He’s having a great first Monday of May but really hated hearing about my thoughts on his destruction of New York city’s homeless encampments… but at least I wished him well on ending gun violence now! 😍 Yet the greatest tribute to the age seemed to be a relative silence from those at the top of New York society as living costs spiral and hard-fought-for human rights are taken away. As celebrities lined up to be photographed, a leaked decision from the supreme court suggested that Roe v Wade would be overturned within weeks, the justices who overturned the landmark abortion ruling more effective in taking America back to a bygone era than anyone showing up in haute couture. Phones were banned at the event so attendees may not have received the supreme court news, but it was more surprising that Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill and the widespread rollback of trans rights in states across America didn’t provoke any response. In 2018, Lena Waithe wore a Carolina Herrera rainbow cape to signal support for LGBTQ+ rights. Last year Schitt’s Creek star Dan Levy wore a Loewe outfit featuring an illustration by artist and Aids activist David Wojnarowicz of two men kissing as a statement for queer love, while footballer Megan Rapinoe carried a placard that read “In Gay We Trust”. This year, the topic was seemingly avoided. The question of whether the Met Gala is the stage for such political statements divides critics. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s “Tax the Rich” dress sparked a debate over whether the red carpet of a glitzy and elite event seemed to contradict her socialist message. AOC responded, telling Vogue: “We can’t just play along, but we need to break the fourth wall and challenge some of the institutions.”​​ But this year, most attendees chose to do neither, avoiding a full embrace of the theme, or an interesting subversion of it. They showed up in designer dresses that looked lovely and uneventful. Even the Met’s own head of costume has said; “I think the power of fashion is that it can reflect the zeitgeist”. So what does last night’s Gala tell us about the time we’re living? Ironically, by saying nothing as the world burns around them, the guests gave a very clear sense that we’re still living in a gilded age.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"By saying nothing as the world burns, the Met Gala shows we’re still living in a gilded age",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/03/met-gala-saying-nothing-world-burns-fashion-gilded-age
5/3/2022,"Ben Stokes will prioritise reigniting a winning mindset after replacing Joe Root as England’s Test captain, with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both scheduled for immediate returns as the team seeks to end a dispiriting run of one win in 17 Test matches. “I want to win games of cricket for England and the best way to do that before a ball has been bowled is to play your best XI,” Stokes said. “Stuart Broad and James Anderson should always be considered for selection because they are the two best bowlers England have. They are two of the greats of the game in my opinion. “At the end of the day, the most important thing for me is winning. I want to be a part of a team that has that real mentality and isn’t going to take a backward step. And the most important people to deliver that message to is the guys in the changing room.” His own first steps as captain will be taken with the assistance of Root, who will remain in the team as a specialist batter. “Joe can help take the added pressures that come with the captaincy off my shoulders,” Stokes said. “I’m going to be using him going forward, especially in my first few months because of how long he did the role for and how good he was doing it. I’ll be learning from Joe about things to keep on top of and also things that he maybe thought he could have done better as well. “It’s naive and stupid to think that now because I’m captain my way is the only way and no one else has a voice or an input. I feel that’s one thing that a leader needs to do – always make sure that the other people around them feel valued and have a voice. It’s one thing I did against West Indies at Southampton [in his one previous match as captain, in July 2020]. I’ll be using that and not just thinking I can do everything.” Stokes also dispelled concerns about his own mental fortitude, insisting that the four-month break from cricket he took last summer ended with him stronger than ever. “I’ve read what’s been said about me taking a break and then taking this role on,” he said. “There’s always a negative feeling around it, but I took my break, I spoke to a bunch of people and I will continue to do that. I see it as a positive that I’m in this role having gone through what I went through last summer and even before that. “I’ve got a huge amount of experience in what the game and what life can throw at you. So I don’t see any of this as a negative whatsoever – I just see it as a huge positive that I’ve got experience of a lot of different scenarios.”",Sport/Sport,‘The best England have’: Stokes paves way for Anderson and Broad Test recalls,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/england-ben-stokes-jimmy-anderson-stuart-broad-test-recalls-cricket
5/3/2022,"Fifa’s independent ethics committee has opened formal proceedings against Patrick Assoumou Eyi, Serge Mombo and two other coaches as part of its investigation into allegations of sexual abuse in Gabon. The former national Under-17 coach Eyi – known as “Capello” – is awaiting sentencing in Gabon after admitting charges of raping, grooming and exploiting young players after allegations first made in the Guardian last year. He was provisionally suspended by the Gabonese Football Federation (Fegafoot) in December and banned from all football-related activities there – a sanction that has now been extended worldwide according to a statement from Fifa on Tuesday. Mombo, who was re-elected as president of La Ligue de l’Estuaire, Gabon’s senior football league, in June 2021, Tout Puissant Akwembé FC’s Orphee Mickala and Triphel Mabicka from Libreville’s Moussavou FC have also been provisionally suspended “from taking part in any football activity (administrative, sports or any other) at both national and international level for a period of 90 days”, the statement said. It added: “These sanctions have been imposed in connection with ongoing criminal investigations concerning the above-mentioned Gabonese football officials, who were identified as having allegedly been involved in acts of systematic sexual abuse against minor players, as reported by local authorities and published in certain media outlets.” Mombo has been accused of sexually abusing young players and demanding sex as a condition of their securing places in national teams. He has denied the claims. Last week Pierre-Alain Mounguengui, the president of Fegafoot, was placed in pre-trial detention at the central prison in Libreville after being arrested in connection with the sexual absue investigation. It is understood that Mounguengui could face up to three years in prison if found guilty of charges that relate to not reporting alleged sexual abuse by a number coaches to the authorities. There is no suggestion Mounguengui has been accused of sexual abuse himself.",Sport/Football,Fifa opens proceedings against four coaches in Gabon sexual abuse inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/fifa-opens-proceedings-against-four-coaches-in-gabon-sexual-abuse-inquiry
5/3/2022,"We are back in the bizarre rococo world – or actually now worlds – of Doctor Strange, Marvel’s mindbending surgeon-turned-superhero who is played with sonorous conviction by Benedict Cumberbatch. He strides unselfconsciously around in a velveteen outfit accessorised with pointy cloak, jet-black goatee and low hairline of pin-sharp definition – similar to the late James Lipton, presenter of TV’s Inside the Actors Studio. Sam Raimi takes over directing duties from the first film’s Scott Derrickson and brings to it essentially the same lite-scary/action aesthetic. As ever, there is a pert tai chi discipline to the little circular sparkly shapes and mystical cosmic portholes that Dr Strange creates with swivelling hand-movements, and he flies through the air in the accepted style, not facing down flat with one fist out like Superman, but upright, right leg elegantly bent at the knee, arms extended backwards. Now Strange has to get his formidable head around the multiverse, a universe of infinite alternative possibilities – and this idea, which other movies have treated with tiresome stoner-seriousness, is handled with cheerful humour and boisterously surreal melodrama. Poor Dr Strange is nursing a broken heart; he is still poignantly carrying a torch for Dr Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), whose wedding to someone else he is attending as a silently lovelorn guest. But there is a ruckus outside: a huge single-eye octopus thingy (very like one of the creatures that appeared in Pixar’s Monsters, Inc) is crashing around in the streets trying to kill a teen called America Chavez (likably played by Xochitl Gomez). Dr Strange realises that he has seen America in a dream – or was it an experience of alt-reality somewhere else in the multiverse? America has the ability to “dreamwalk” – to enter into other parallel universes – and it is an ability she can’t control and which has enraged this demon; Strange realises it is his destiny to protect her. But he makes the fateful decision to enlist the help of ex-Avenger Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who is haunted with her own lonely visions of an alternative existence in which she has two children, and she longs for motherhood above everything else. The result is a freaky adventure, which brings Dr Strange face-to-face with how his own life and death might have been viewed by the superhero community in another life, and by what conspiratorial means the Avengers might be promoting their interests in a post-Thanos world. Familiar supporting characters recur: Benedict Wong is back, entertainingly playing Sorcerer Supreme, and Chiwetel Ejiofor is Strange’s old enemy Mordo. The Ancient One (played in the first film by Tilda Swinton and the subject of a brief culture-war casting row) is absent. Strange has to tackle two separate MacGuffins of equal importance and silliness: the “dark hold”, a corrupting power that enables the user to dreamwalk, and the protective force that is the Book of the Vishanti (the opposite of the dark hold). But the movie’s most entertaining scenes do not rely on these polar opposites, but on Strange and America whizzing through various multiverse realities, including one made entirely of poster paints. There is a funny scene in which they arrive in a version of New York where everything is decorated with plants and flowers (inspired by the High Line, perhaps), where you “go” on a red signal and where fast food is served in little balls. Oddly, despite the fact that lonely Wanda is vouchsafed agonising visions of a life with two adorable young sons, Dr Strange doesn’t get to see what it would look like living in marital bliss with Christine; the movie is, I think, missing a trick here. The multiverse madness is treated with genial high-energy panache, though I have to say that this infinite profusion of realities does not actually feel all that different in practice from the shapeshifting, retconning world of all the other Avengers films. And infinite realities tend to reduce the dramatic impact of any one single reality, and reduces what there is at stake in a given situation. Nonetheless, it’s handled with lightness and fun. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is released on 5 May in Australia and the UK, and on 6 May in the US.

5/3/2022,"Around a conference room table, young Taliban fighters quietly listen to an instructor teaching them how to behave with civilians. Awkwardly armed with notebooks and pens, most of the 25 fighters turned policemen have never been in a classroom before. They have spent most of their young lives as combatants in rural areas, and under their ample traditional outfits, their wrist-sized ankles betray how undernourished they are. “What is the problem with bringing weapons inside a hospital?” trainer Raouf asks. “People will be scared,” a young Taliban member answers. “It will have a bad effect on sick people,” another says. This two-day class on international humanitarian law (IHL), organised by Geneva Call, a humanitarian organisation, takes place in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan. “Did you ever bring your gun inside the hospital?” Raouf asks. All the fighters laugh. “Yes,” they say, “of course!” The rules of IHL can seem obvious: you cannot punish someone you arrest before they go to court; boys under 18 are children and should not fight; or “if someone is not fighting against you, you should not fight them”. But, Raouf says, these students “have no knowledge of all these things, they were in the mountains with only guns”.Since October, Raouf has trained 250 men in Kandahar. “If we continue, I am sure they will change. I have seen a lot of changes already.”After class, the fighters say they will modify some behaviours. “I will not enter hospitals with weapons any more,” says Barakatullah, 28. “It was also new for me to hear that we have to respect the human dignity of prisoners.” During the course, Barakatullah had stood up to speak about the torture he’d endured at Bagram jail, where he spent eight years. But the young man, with his long black beard and soft eyes, seems more weary than angry. After losing all his family except his mother in a US airstrike, all he wishes for is “a normal life”. “If I can find another job, I would leave the police. I can be a shopkeeper or work for an NGO.” According to Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute, it is important to keep engaging with the Taliban. “Even small changes to their behaviour could save lives,” she says. In the classroom, all students wear a turban or a small traditional hat. Some regularly raise their hands to answer. Others fidget with their prayer beads at the back, struggling to sit still. Fighters readily agree with preventing gender violence, but some topics call for more tact, like the use of improvised explosive devices (IED), suicide bombers or any act that may hurt civilians. Taliban soldiers, since their return to power, have often killed civilians because their vehicles didn’t stop at checkpoints.“The Taliban have transitioned from a fighting force to a government almost overnight – with almost no preparation, training or understanding of things like human rights norms,” says Jackson. “There are horrific problems with torture and beating in Taliban detention. And the Taliban isn’t doing much to address that, so it’s really up to others to try whatever they can to prevent more suffering.” Kefayatullah, 22, one of those on the course, now works in a jail. “I learned yesterday that we should behave humanely with prisoners,” he says. “When I went back to the prison where I work, a person called saying that the mother of a prisoner wanted to talk to her son. Before, we were not allowing this. But because of the training, I gave my mobile to the prisoner to speak to his mother.” About 60% of the students cannot read, some have only attended religious classes in rural madrasas. “I’d like to restart my education and learn English. After class yesterday, I told my friends we should ask for a teacher to come to the police headquarters,” says Kefayatullah. During the break, the fighters stay seated, laugh and take pictures of each other. It is an image far removed from the one they often project in propaganda videos. According to Faryaneh Fadaei, Geneva Call’s director for Afghanistan, the key to the training’s success is to adapt the material to cultural sensitivities, with each rule linked to Islamic references “Because it is contextualised, developed with community leaders and religious scholars, it is accepted,” says Fadaei. “Usually after the training, the participants ask for more training and booklets to give to their friends.” Geneva Call trains between 200 and 400 people a month across Afghanistan, half of them members of armed forces. Maiwandi, 21, is in the Taliban’s elite special forces. Seated at the back in his military jacket, he struggles to concentrate. Maiwandi joined the Taliban at 12. At 19, faced with brutal US raids in his village, he enrolled as a suicide bomber. “This war took the best years of my life, my childhood and my education,” he says. “Now when I see people who are educated, who went to university, I feel bad and wish I was them.” Like Barakatullah or Kefayatullah, Maiwandi represents the importance of Geneva Call’s training for young Taliban members who have only known violence. After the course, Maiwandi says he would love to study more in future but adds that, if asked by his leadership, he would do what he’d signed up for, as a suicide bomber. Still, perhaps, he hopes “there will be no more war”.

5/3/2022,"An average job description these days reads something like this. Duties: Everything from editing short films to creating pivot tables in Excel to wowing clients with interpretative dance! Hours: Every single hour in the day. Qualifications: 15 years in this field, plus a PhD. Compensation: Haha, why would we tell you that? Nah, you’re going to have to waste your time filling in a ton of paperwork and going to a bunch of interviews before we’ll let you in on that little secret. For now, all we can say is that it’s “competitive”. But not so “competitive” that we’re keen to advertise it. As anyone who has ever looked for a job knows, companies can be maddeningly cryptic about their compensation packages; it’s pretty rare to see a salary range in job postings. But that’s starting to change. There is a growing body of evidence that salary transparency is a powerful tool in closing the gender and racial pay gap, and there’s increasing pressure around the world for employers to start being more open about what they pay people. The EU, for example, is currently mulling a groundbreaking proposal that would mean large employers would have to provide salary ranges on job ads and workers would have the right to request pay data broken down by gender and job level. Across the Atlantic, there’s a similar fight for pay transparency. Last year, New York City passed a major new law that would require companies with more than four employees to list the minimum and maximum pay the employer “in good faith believes” it will pay. That law was supposed to come into effect this month but, at the very last moment, it got postponed until November. Why the delay? Well, you’ll be glad to know that it’s because corporations just want everything to be fair and right. They have all our best interests at heart. In one of the most stunning examples of disingenuous corporate nonsense I have ever seen (and I’ve seen a lot of corporate nonsense) a coalition of NYC business groups complained to the city council that salary transparency requirements would hurt diversity efforts. According to the letter these jokers drafted: “In the context of achieving diversity goals, the posted maximum may be significantly higher than the historical salary ranges, creating dissatisfaction in the workforce.” These people have the gall to argue that companies are falling over themselves trying to give “diverse hires” massive pay packets and salary transparency laws would hinder these valiant efforts because all the non-diverse people would get upset. This, I can’t stress enough, is utter BS. You just need to look at the gender pay gap to see that it’s BS. To reiterate, a lot of research shows that the gender gap dramatically shrinks when employers adopt transparent pay practices. Weaponising diversity to try to undermine an initiative that would almost certainly help non-white, non-male candidates is vile. I’m not saying that pay transparency is entirely without its problems, mind you. There are pros and cons to it, like everything else in life. While transparency is good, it’s always possible to have a little too much of a good thing. In Norway, for example, you can easily look up tax data and see what your neighbours or friends are earning and how much they have paid in tax. People were so fond of doing this that, at one point, the practice got dubbed financial or tax porn. There was reportedly even an app that let people create leaderboards with the highest and lowest earners among their Facebook friends. Nevertheless, I would rather deal with too much information than the current information asymmetry that exists between companies and candidates. There are far worse problems to have than “tax porn”.
