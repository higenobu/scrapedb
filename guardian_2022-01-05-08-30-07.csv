1/5/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has prompted a furore after saying that his government’s vaccination strategy is to “piss off” people who have not had coronavirus jabs by continuing to make making daily life more and more difficult for them. “I am not about pissing off the French people,” the president said in an interview with readers of Le Parisien daily on Tuesday. “But as for the non-vaccinated, I really want to piss them off. And we will continue to do this, to the end. This is the strategy.”  Macron’s remarks came as the French parliament debated new legislation that, if passed, will mean only the fully vaccinated – and no longer those with a negative Covid test – will qualify for the country’s health pass from next month. The pass, introduced this summer, is required in France for access to indoor public places such as cafes, restaurants, cinemas, museums, concert venues and sports centres, as well as to board long-distance trains and planes. “In a democracy, the worst enemies are lies and stupidity,” Macron said. “We are putting pressure on the unvaccinated by limiting, as much as possible, their access to activities in social life.” France has vaccinated almost 90% of its population who are eligible, Macron said, and it was “only a very small minority who are resisting. How do we reduce that minority? We reduce it – sorry for the expression – by pissing them off even more.” The president, who said he wanted to run for a second term in presidential elections in April but would not make his decision public until “the health situation allows”, added that he was “not going to jail [the unvaccinated], or forcibly vaccinate them.” So, he said, “we have to tell them: from 15 January, you will no longer be able to go to the restaurant. You will no longer be able to go for a coffee, you will no longer be able to go to the theatre. You will no longer be able to go to the cinema.” Macron added: “When my freedoms threaten those of others, I become someone irresponsible. Someone irresponsible is not a citizen.” The president’s political opponents accused the president – who in the early stages of his term faced accusations of arrogance, tactlessness and being out of touch from parts of the French population – of excessive language. “No health emergency justifies such words,” said Bruno Retailleau, head of the right-wing Republicans in the Senate. “Emmanuel Macron says he has learned to love the French, but it seems he especially likes to despise them.” Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, said a president “should not say such things”, adding: “He is turning the unvaccinated into second-class citizens.” Others also criticised the proposed law. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of the radical left France Insoumise party, called Macron’s language “appalling”, adding: “It’s clear the vaccine pass is a collective punishment against individual liberties.” Analysts said that while the language was crude and could prompt an extreme, possibly violent reaction from anti-vaxxers, the president’s remarks appeared to reflect a careful political calculation. Polls show a large majority of French voters are growing increasingly frustrated with the pandemic and back the vaccine pass as an effective means to end it, they said – and of those who opposed it, very few are likely to cast their ballot for Macron.",News/World news,Macron declares his Covid strategy is to ‘piss off’ the unvaccinated,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/macron-declares-his-covid-strategy-is-to-piss-off-the-unvaccinated
1/5/2022,"At least 66 people have arrived on the Kent coast aboard two boats, completing the first crossings of the Channel this year. Tuesday’s latest arrivals come after more than 28,300 people crossed the Dover Strait on small vessels in 2021, three times the number for 2020.  Last year’s record number, an increase of about 20,000 on 2020, came despite the UK government promising millions of pounds to French authorities to tackle the issue. Border Force and French boats were active in the Channel on Tuesday, as attempts to cross the dangerous waters renewed. Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive at Refugee Action, claimed the UK government’s failure to provide safe routes for refugees will only lead to more deaths. He said: “People will continue to cross the Channel in flimsy boats, and smugglers will continue to profit, unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum here. “[In November] we saw the deadly result of their strategy of keeping people out rather than keeping people safe, when at least 27 people died near our coast. “And yet the government wants to legalise this dangerous and callous policy in its anti-refugee bill, which will only lead to more people drowning. It must wake up and scrap this bill now.” At least 28,395 people reached the UK on small boats in 2021, according to analysis by the Press Association. The busiest month for arrivals was November, when at least 6,869 people reached the UK. On 24 November, an inflatable dinghy capsized in the Channel, causing the deaths of 27 people, including a seven-year-old boy and a pregnant woman. Despite collecting its own data on small boat crossings, the Home Office refuses to release annual figures, which are instead compiled daily by journalists. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said: “Seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel.” He said the government is “reforming” its approach by “making the tough decisions to end the overt exploitation of our laws and UK taxpayers”.",News/World news,At least 66 people arrive in Kent after first Channel boat crossings of 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/at-least-66-people-arrive-in-kent-after-first-channel-boat-crossings-of-2022
1/5/2022,"Shelves are empty in supermarkets once again as staff shortages due to illness or isolation combine with ongoing supply chain difficulties. Australia hit the grim milestone of more than 500,000 Covid cases since the pandemic began on Tuesday. Daily cases in the states and territories continue to rise, forcing tens of thousands into quarantine and even more close contacts into isolation.  Woolworths apologised for the lack of some products as distribution centres – particularly in Sydney – suffered from Covid absenteeism. A spokesperson said they were working to replenish stores “as quickly as possible” as case numbers increase. “The pandemic has delivered many challenges over the past two years and will continue to do so as we move into this next phase,” the spokesperson said. “We’re currently experiencing delays with some of our stock deliveries to stores due to Covid-related impacts on our supply chain operations.” Coles also apologised and promised shelves would be restocked as soon as possible. “We are … seeing an increased number of team members being required to isolate due to household exposure to Covid while they wait for test results,” a spokesperson said. “We are continuing to monitor team member availability across our business.” Coles also said supply issues included a lack of shipping pallets and transport capacity. A global timber shortage has contributed to a lack of pallets to move goods around. The challenge has been compounded by Covid-related factory closures overseas, as well as increasing local freight costs and a looming shortage of urea, a critical component of diesel fuel. “We have been working with our suppliers and other stakeholders to address a number of supply chain issues including availability of shipping pallets and transport capacity, to ensure we can continue to provide our customers with the food and drinks they need,” the Coles spokesperson said. An Aldi spokesperson said Covid was putting additional pressure on its supply chain but that it was doing its best to minimise any disruption. Shoppers reported shortages of fresh fruit and vegetables, meat, and other products including toilet paper. The issues facing those products are different from the shortage of rapid antigen tests, which stem from a lack of supply altogether.",News/Business,Australian supermarkets grapple with Covid-based staff shortages,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/australian-supermarkets-grapple-with-covid-based-staff-shortages
1/5/2022,"Hospitals in Greater Manchester have paused non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments due to the rising impact of Covid on patients and staff. A statement by Greater Manchester Combined Authority said the temporary measure, affecting 17 hospitals from Tuesday, will not apply to cancer and urgent care, including cardiac surgery, vascular surgery and transplantation.  About 15% of staff across the region are off sick or isolating with Covid, while in some hospitals more than one in five patients have the virus. Diagnostic services, including endoscopy, and the majority of outpatient services will continue “wherever possible”. The statement reads: “Staff have worked tirelessly to try to maintain services and deliver the highest quality of healthcare to local people. “But Covid admissions are rising sharply (from 126 on 19 December to 359 on 2 January), as are inpatient diagnoses (193 to 738 for the same period), and in some hospitals more than one in five patients have Covid (though this is not translating into critical care pressure at present). “However, the main reason is the high and rising level of staff absence, with around 15% off, either ill with Covid or isolating. “There are also outbreaks in an increasing number of care homes, which is affecting how people are discharged from hospital. “The bed modelling suggests these challenges may get worse, not better, in the next week or two.” The hospitals affected include Royal Bolton hospital, Trafford general hospital, Wythenshawe hospital and Macclesfield district general hospital. Patients who are not contacted should assume their treatment is continuing as planned, the statement added. Fiona Noden, chief executive of Bolton NHS foundation trust, co-chair of Greater Manchester hospital gold command and lead for elective care in the region, said: “This has been a very difficult decision and not one that we have taken lightly, but we’ve done it so we can keep people safe, can maintain the very best infection control measures, can make sure we deploy staff to where they’re needed most and can keep looking after people who need urgent and emergency care, including cancer treatment.”",News/World news,Non-urgent surgery and appointments paused across Greater Manchester,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/04/non-urgent-surgery-and-appointments-paused-across-greater-manchester
1/5/2022,"The US House of Representatives panel investigating the deadly attack on the US Capitol in January last year is seeking cooperation from Fox News host Sean Hannity in relation to its inquiry. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chair of the committee, and vice-chair Liz Cheney have requested that Hannity answer questions in relation to communications between Hannity and Donald Trump, as well as the former president’s chief of staff Mark Meadows, and others in the days leading up to the attack, the day itself and in the aftermath.  “The select committee is seeking information from Sean Hannity about information relevant to the committee’s investigation into the violent attack of January 6th and its causes,” Thompson and Cheney said in a letter made public on Tuesday. In the letter to Hannity, they wrote: “The Select Committee now has information in its possession, as outlined in part below, indicating that you had advance knowledge regarding President Trump’s and his legal team’s planning for January 6th. “It also appears that you were expressing concerns and providing advice to the President and certain White House staff regarding that planning. You also had relevant communications while the riot was underway, and in the days thereafter. These communications make you a fact witness in our investigation.” The House select committee investigating the 6 January insurrection last month revealed that Hannity and other Fox News hosts had messaged Meadows during the attack. Hannity has been a major supporter of Trump on his Fox show, as well as an adviser to the former president. “Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol?” Hannity texted Meadows during the attack, records made public last month show.

1/5/2022,"The decision to grant Novak Djokovic an exemption from Covid-19 vaccination requirements to play in the Australian Open in Melbourne has been labelled “appalling”, with some players expressing surprise at the late decision. On Tuesday night, the defending Australian Open champion posted on Instagram that he was coming to Melbourne to participate in the tennis tournament with an “exemption permission”.  All Australian Open participants must either be fully vaccinated or apply for and secure a medical exemption in order to enter Victoria without undertaking the mandatory 14-day quarantine. Tennis Australia said tennis players seeking an exemption went through a two-stage process, with their application first considered by a panel of experts in Tennis Australia, and then an assessment from the Victorian government. Craig Tiley, CEO of Tennis Australia, said the exemption granted to Djokovic is the same medical exemption anyone can get under the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) guidelines. “If there are several reasons why they are unable to be vaccinated, Atagi have set out very clear guidelines that have to be followed in order for you to be added to the Australian immunisation register and if you are added to that register, you are then exempt from a vaccination and can come into Australia,” he told Nine’s Today Show. “For tennis players, it was a process that was above and beyond what anyone coming to Australia would have experienced. Simply because we had an extra panel … which through a blind review assessed any application and then granted exemptions if it was appropriate.” Tiley said it was up to Djokovic to decide whether to disclose the reason the exemption was granted. The Atagi guidelines state exemptions can be given for those with acute medical conditions, including undergoing major surgery, those who have had Covid-19 in the past six months or have had a serious adverse event attributed to a previous Covid vaccine dose. Former Australian Medical Association vice president Stephen Parnis said the decision to give an exemption was appalling. “I don’t care how good a tennis player he is. If he’s refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn’t be allowed in,” Parnis tweeted. “If this exemption is true, it sends an appalling message to millions seeking to reduce #COVID19Aus risk to themselves & others. #Vaccination shows respect, Novak.” Australian tennis players James Duckworth and Alex de Minaur expressed surprise at the decision when asked at the ATP tournament in Sydney. “Look, I don’t know the criteria for exemptions. Yeah. Apparently it’s an independent panel. He must have fit the criteria somehow,” Duckworth said. “That’s very politically correct of you,” de Minaur replied. “I just think it’s very interesting. That’s all I’m going to say.” Tiley said 26 people associated with the Australian Open applied for a medical exemption to come to the tournament, but only a handful were granted. Deputy Victorian Liberal leader David Southwick said it was a “disgrace”. “What a disgrace! We have had 6 lockdowns – schools and small businesses closed, funerals and weddings told not to go ahead, families separated for months on end and now a tennis star gets an exemption,” he tweeted. “A kick in the guts to every Victorian.” The decision also drew an angry reaction on social media, with many predicting a hostile welcome for the nine-time Australian Open champion when he takes the court. Whoever knocks Djokovic out of the #AusOpen may never need to buy a beer In Australia ever again. I reckon the crowd reaction to this is going to be very unpleasant indeed. And they will have a heck of a time explaining the exemption grounds beyond him being Novak Djokovic. https://t.co/IEdok8Sf6M Former AFL great Kevin Bartlett said on Twitter that the public had been “taken for fools”. Russian tennis star Natalia Vikhlyantseva announced in December she would skip the Australian Open because the Sputnik vaccine she has received is not recognised in Australia. Just last month, Victoria’s deputy premier, James Merlino, said exemptions on medical grounds should not be viewed as a “loophole for privileged tennis players” and everyone at the Open is expected to be vaccinated.",Sport/Sport,‘Appalling message’: outrage over Novak Djokovic’s medical exemption to play Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/appalling-message-outrage-over-novak-djokovics-medical-exemption-to-play-australian-open
1/5/2022,"Star centre-forward sparks unrest with unauthorised interview over frustration. It is the banner headline that stalks Chelsea into their Carabao Cup semi-final first leg against Tottenham at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. But it is also the one that has cast long shadows at Spurs since May. For Romelu Lukaku’s comments to Sky Italia, broadcast last Thursday, see those of Harry Kane to Gary Neville on The Overlap podcast; the ones in which he said he was approaching a crossroads and made clear he wanted a new challenge away from Spurs.  For Antonio Conte, the Spurs manager – previously of Chelsea, where he won one Premier League and one FA Cup in two seasons coloured by increasing levels of friction – diplomacy has been the watchword. Conte loves Lukaku, with whom he worked productively at Internazionale – the pair won Serie A last season – and he was never going to give his thoughts on the player saying he was unhappy at Chelsea and questioning the system of the manager, Thomas Tuchel. Conte’s take on Kane is more balanced, saying that the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, made a “great choice” to hold him to his contract in the face of interest from Manchester City. “In this way, you are showing you want to continue to build something important around one of the best players in your team,” Conte said. But he also expressed his understanding of Kane’s situation, a measure of solidarity. Like Kane, Conte came through the ranks at his hometown club, playing for Lecce for six and a bit seasons. He then moved to Juventus at 22 and stayed for the remainder of his playing days, winning 14 trophies across 13 seasons, including five league titles and one Champions League. Kane has yet to win any team honours during his one-club career. “I understand Harry’s situation,” Conte said. “When you finish your career, you can see your appearances and the teams you made them for but, at the same time, it’s right to see what you have won. This is important, especially for the top, top players. Sometimes it happens that important players finish with a couple of titles and other players who are medium or medium-low finish with many titles.” Conte’s trophy haul as a manager stands at nine, including four Serie A titles – the first three with Juventus – and he makes no bones about why Levy signed him. If Chelsea had the star manager in Tuchel and then added the big‑name striker in Lukaku, it was the other way round at Spurs but the ends are the same. “For Tottenham to bring me here, I think that he [Levy] wanted to send a signal outside and maybe also to our players,” Conte said. “Now we see what happens. Because to take the coach that is used to win, then you have to do.” A little message, perhaps, as to the need for Levy to back him in the transfer market? What Conte knows is that he requires time because Spurs are not at the level they were under Mauricio Pochettino, who had established them in the top four. “For sure, there is an important gap with other teams,” Conte said. “I see many, many teams that are more ready now to win titles. We have to build a situation where we can be competitive and try to win.” Conte was more than just an interested onlooker for the summer saga involving Kane, having been approached to take charge at Tottenham in early June. There is no way Conte would have said yes if he had suspected Kane were leaving, although it should be stressed that Levy never had any intention of allowing the player to go. Conte’s proposed switch back then broke down quickly and for other reasons and Kane would eventually announce on 25 August that he was staying. It has been a tough season in general for him but there have been more encouraging signs since Conte completed his move to Spurs at the second attempt, replacing Nuno Espírito Santo at the start of November. “In the summer I followed the situation about Harry and I saw what happened and what could happen,” Conte said. “But we have to live in the present and that says Harry is a player at Tottenham. First of all we are talking about a really good person, a really good man. I am totally satisfied with his commitment and the relationship that we have created within the team. I have found a player that is totally involved in this project now.” Conte’s Stamford Bridge return will stir good and bad memories. His title win in 2016-17 was little short of extraordinary, given the club had finished 10th the previous time out, but fifth in his second season – and the failure to secure Champions League football – was a blot. Then there were the draining disagreements with the hierarchy over transfer policy, the strained relations with a number of players in the second season and the protracted legal battle over his payoff, which he would win. “We won the league with a team that I think wasn’t the best in the league,” Conte said. “We reached the final in the FA Cup and then won it in the second season. We did a fantastic job but sometimes it’s not enough. When it happens that the club sends you away, you can be disappointed and frustrated but you have to show great respect for the decision.”",Sport/Football,Conte gives Levy a nudge as Lukaku storm stirs up Kane question at Spurs | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/04/conte-gives-levy-a-nudge-as-lukaku-storm-stirs-up-kane-question-at-spurs
1/5/2022,"Kieran Trippier is set to join Newcastle United after a fee, reportedly an initial £12m with add-ons, was agreed with Atlético Madrid. The England right-back has also agreed personal terms after further discussions between the club and the player’s representatives. The Premier League club are now organising Trippier’s medical before he is officially unveiled as a Newcastle player.  Trippier will become Newcastle’s first signing since the club were taken over by a Saudi-backed consortium in October. Negotiations for the 31-year-old have been ongoing since December, with Atlético agreeing to sell when it became clear that Trippier wanted to leave and return to England. The former Tottenham full-back played under the Newcastle manager, Eddie Howe, at Burnley and also played for Barnsley after developing as a youth player at Manchester City. Trippier made 67 appearances in two-and-a-half years at Atlético and won the Spanish title with Atlético last season, earning a place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad for Euro 2020. Newcastle are hoping to add at least three more January signings in a bid to avoid relegation this season, with Burnley centre-back James Tarkowski a target. Howe is also keen to add a central midfielder and a forward, with Callum Wilson facing a long spell out with a torn calf muscle. In other news, Ainsley Maitland-Niles is on the verge of joining José Mourinho’s Roma on loan until the end of the season, with no purchase option agreed. Arsenal will receive €1m (£830,000) in loan fees – €500,000 up front with another €500,000 in bonuses – with Roma also paying the midfielder’s wages during his loan spell. Maitland-Niles asked to leave Arsenal on social media at the end of the summer transfer window but stayed at the Emirates, making only two Premier League starts so far this season.
