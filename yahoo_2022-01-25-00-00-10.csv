1/25/2022,"There's no such thing as a perfect relationship. Whether you've been together 10 months or 10 years, differences of opinion, life stressors, and even petty squabbles will rear their ugly heads. However, there are habits you can develop to avoid these issues as much as possible—and ones you'll want to avoid at all costs to prevent them in the first place. Ready to do a relationship audit? We recommend starting with your nighttime routine. Read on to discover the evening actions some couples skip that sabotage their relationship before they even wake up. RELATED: 32 Percent of People Do This Behind Their Partner's Back, New Study Finds. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults should get at least seven hours of sleep per night. Anything less, and you might see an impact on your relationship. One 2013 study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science found that participants reported more conflict with their partners on days following a poor night's sleep. ""If you have ever seen a two-year-old who skipped a nap, you can see a version of how we all react to sleep deprivation in terms of our emotions,"" Jennifer L. Martin, PhD, a clinical psychologist and behavioral sleep medicine specialist at UCLA, told Time. ""Small problems seem bigger. Our reactions are amplified."" RELATED: If You and Your Spouse Do This Together, You're 3.5 Times More Likely to Divorce. Increased squabbling isn't the only side effect of poor sleep. The habit can also cause increased feelings of hostility toward your partner. For a second 2013 study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, researchers asked couples to rate how they slept the previous night and videotape themselves discussing a source of conflict. Those who had slept poorly reported more negative feelings toward their S.O. After watching the videos, researchers noted the poor sleepers also showed decreased empathy, conflict resolution skills, and an ability to gauge a partner's emotions. Sometimes, the tell-tale signs of a poor night's sleep are written all over your face. Your under-eye bags seem bigger, your skin looks more inflamed, and your eyes feel red and scratchy. Unfortunately, other people—including your partner—may notice this too. A 2017 study published in Royal Society Publishing found that strangers rated sleep-deprived people as less healthy and less attractive than those who had received a good night's sleep. They also added that they would be less inclined to socialize with the people who looked tired. Obviously, that's not the type of energy you want to bring into your relationship—which is why decent shuteye should be a priority.

Now that you know the nighttime habit that can hinder your partnership, here's one that can help it: cuddling. John Gottman, PhD, a psychologist specializing in marital stability and founder of the Gottman Institute, considers cuddling one of the top 10 habits of couples who have a great sex life. ""Partners who cuddle tend to feel very connected and bonded, especially as cuddling provides a sense of being loved and wanted,"" Carla Marie Manly, PhD, a clinical psychologist, told Well+Good. ""When long-term partners make it a practice to cuddle, their physical and emotional connection tends to be very strong."" So, there you have it. In order to create a strong, healthy relationship, you'll want to adjust your nighttime routine to include seven-plus hours of sleep and lots of snuggles. We have a feeling you'll happily oblige.

1/25/2022,"There are plenty of things you can do on a daily basis to care for your heart health. You may decide to exercise a bit more, try regulating your stress levels, get better sleep, or change up your diet to include more heart-healthy foods. These steps are all valuable, especially because there isn't a one-step solution for caring for your heart health. And if you're someone who is taking these brave steps toward better health, you may also want to try avoiding certain foods and drinks that can negatively impact your journey to a happy heart. For example, according to Trista Best, MPH, RD, LD at Balance One Supplements, energy drinks are some of the worst drinks you can have for your heart. ""Of all the beverages that are potentially detrimental to heart health, energy drinks are at the top of the list,"" says Best, ""and this is because while caffeine can be heart-healthy when consumed in moderation, these beverages can get up to 300 milligrams of caffeine in just one serving."" For one, too much caffeine can exacerbate heart palpitations and symptoms of anxiety, such as a racing heart. If you're someone who is already prone to a racing heart, drinking energy drinks can lead to uncomfortable palpitations. Cleveland Clinic notes that ""while they aren't usually dangerous, they can be alarming."" Excess caffeine can also have more harmful side effects as well. ""It can, unfortunately, place an individual in atrial fibrillation, result in high blood pressure, and even lead to heart attack and stroke in some cases,"" says Best. The increase in blood pressure with too much caffeine can be small, but if you're someone who already has high blood pressure or other heart problems, this can have a negative impact on your heart health. Drinking too much caffeine from an energy drink can also have a diuretic effect on your body, which means that you have to urinate more than usual. Best warns that this combined with the fact that people sometimes drink these instead of water, you may become dehydrated without realizing it. And unfortunately, ""the heart of a dehydrated individual must work harder due to less blood circulating through the body,"" says Best. If you're someone who already struggles with high blood pressure or other heart complications, you may want to avoid energy drinks or consuming too much caffeine. If you're still wanting a boost of energy during your day, you can check out our list of The Best Energy Drinks of 2021 in order to choose one that has lower levels of caffeine.

1/25/2022,"Even if you've never heard of a company called Plaid, they may owe you part of a multi-million dollar lawsuit settlement, Fast Company has reported. Plaid, which connects consumer bank accounts to services like Venmo, Robinhood, Coinbase and other apps, was accused of collecting excessive financial data from consumers. While denying any wrongdoing, it agreed to pay $58 million to all consumers with a linked bank account to any of its approximately 5,000 client apps. The lawsuit accused Plaid of collecting ""more financial data than was needed from users."" It also claimed that the company obtained users' bank login information via its own ""Plaid Link"" interface, ""which had the look and feel of the user’s own bank account login screen,"" according to the settlement website. On top of the $58 million payout, the company was forced to change some of its business practices.  Millions of people use apps linked to Plaid, so any payout might be pretty slim. Still, if you're a US resident who had a bank account connected to the app between January 1st, 2013 and November 19th, 2021, you may qualify to receive a claim. For more, see the settlement site's FAQ.  You may have already received an email about the lawsuit, or you can check the settlement's search section to see if you've used an app that qualifies. In any case, you have until April 28th, 2022 to submit your claim.",Business/Engadget,"Plaid must pay $58 million to users of Venmo, Robinhood and other apps",https://news.yahoo.com/plaid-must-pay-58-million-to-users-of-venmo-robinhood-and-other-apps-085908511.html
