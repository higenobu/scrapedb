2/10/2022,"Tasmania’s education minister, Sarah Courtney, has announced she is resigning from politics amid criticism for taking a French holiday as stressed parents prepared to send their children back to school during the pandemic. Courtney’s holiday went for several weeks and overlapped with the return to school and uncertainty over Covid restrictions and concerns, drawing criticism from Labor and the Greens.  Courtney, who caught Covid while overseas and had previously held the health portfolio, announced on Thursday she was going. “I am resigning as both minister and member for Bass,” she said. “I have given my heart and soul to this role for eight years and have taken every step to ensure it is my first priority. “However, I believe the time has come for me to move on.” Courtney added that she was not resigning over the criticisms surrounding her holiday, but as a result of a “range of different factors”. “The decision was the culmination and confluence of a range of different factors. I’ve been reflecting on my time. The past two years in particular has been especially gruelling; rewarding, but very gruelling and exhausting,” she said. “When I was on leave, it gave me the opportunity to properly consider what future is personally right for me and my family. “It has not been a quick nor an easy decision.” Courtney contracted Covid while on holiday, forcing her to isolate in France days out from the school year beginning. She only returned to the state this week. She also referenced a recent family tragedy, saying a funeral was to be held tomorrow for her grandmother who had died with Covid.

2/10/2022,"An image hangs before a classroom of children. Stitched from primary colours, the mural depicts animals, two-by-two, leaving a wooden structure beneath the arc of a rainbow. It is a mural of the Biblical flood narrative, when judgment threatened creation but the holy few found safety within the ark. It is one of my earliest memories of school. I have remembered this image recently, as my own son starts school. Growing up attending a Christian school, I came to see the ark as a metaphor for what religious environments can offer. Each school day, children lined up before wooden classrooms, one girl alongside one boy, and entered an environment where we felt included, and protected from the harm outside. I felt safe.  The question of safety has never been more relevant for religious schools as Citipointe Christian College made headlines for condemning homosexuality and suggesting that transgender teens would only be recognised by their “biological sex” in school contracts. The contracts were consequently withdrawn as the principal stood aside, insisting that the school “would never discriminate against any student on the basis of their sexuality or gender identity.” The chaos unfolded a week before the federal government’s religious discrimination bill returned to the parliament. While a religious school was a safe environment for me, they may not always be for everyone. Research demonstrates that a religious upbringing is healthy for the development of young people, unless the young people are LGBTQIA+, in which case it can be a risk factor for suicidal ideation. Given the controversial legislation has now passed the lower house with amendments, this raises a question I asked myself many times; can I send my son to a school that might be unsafe? Religious schools already have exemptions from the Sex Discrimination Act that allows them to discriminate. I have heard stories from a number of different schools. I know one devout teacher who was fired from a religious school for being gay. I know another who lost employment, not because of their orientation, but because they were affirming of queer communities. I know of another teacher who was asked repeatedly to sign a contract with anti-gay statements of belief, despite the fact that they had queer children. The religious discrimination bill will provide further allowances for religious schools to discriminate like this. While last minute amendments will protect queer students from expulsion, that may also now guarantee that LGBTQIA+ children simply remain in non-affirming school environments that can refer to their characteristics as “immoral” and “offensive”. Condemning and denouncing people’s orientation might still be protected under the legislation’s statements of belief clause, and research has shown that LGBTQIA+ young people exposed to a non-affirming religious message are considerably more likely to have thoughts of self-harm and suicide. Queer teenagers are five times more likely to have attempted suicide in their lifetimes and suicide is already the single biggest killer of young people in Australia. For queer young people in non-affirming religious schools, the government’s legislation will increase this risk. If some religious schools are harmful for the vulnerable, a suicide risk for children, how can our law empower that? For parents choosing schools for their children, how can we empower this? My partner and I sat in the office of a Christian school, different to the one I knew, our son playing with wooden toys in the corner. We had been considering the options for our son’s education and I asked the school representative if queer kids and parents would be affirmed or condemned in their school. I asked if transgender teens would have their gender identity accepted or rejected. I asked if their teachers had their employment made dependent on a non-affirming practice and punitive theology. The school representative smiled politely; we will adhere to our beliefs. I didn’t ask the question that was really on my mind; what if my own son was queer in this school? I looked over at my son in the corner and noticed the toys he was playing with; small wooden animals and the structure of an ark. My son lines up outside his classroom on his sixth day of school. I have just dropped him off at the local state school. It has a policy of respect and diversity regarding sexuality and gender and, as he enters, I know he feels safe. The Biblical flood story is a parable that begins with judgment, but ends in a promise of safety. I know many who have worked in religious schools for decades caring for children. I know there are religious schools that are inclusive and crucial for special needs young people. I know many families make the best choices they can. Like the mural from my memory, however, I know there are many leaving the ark behind, seeking the safety promised by the rainbow outside. If the religious discrimination legislation can’t promise safety, then it should be abandoned. The fight to amend the legislation now moves to the Senate and it is time for the major parties to reject it, and to start discussing a comprehensive Human Rights Act that offers safety to all teachers and students. Our laws must protect us all equally, and no true religion discriminates. Some religious schools have strived to be an ark for the holy few. It is time we remember the rainbow instead.
