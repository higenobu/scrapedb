1/3/2022,"Queensland’s chief health officer has said “all of us are going to be exposed” to Covid-19 in the coming weeks, as concerns mount about increasing case numbers in the state’s remote Indigenous communities. Outbreaks of the Omicron variant have now taken hold in Cherbourg and Palm Island, which both have relatively low vaccination rates compared with the wider population.  In Cherbourg, about 250km north-west of Brisbane, there were 90 confirmed cases on Monday, mainly among younger people. Two are in hospital and one is in intensive care. The vaccination rate in Cherbourg is below 60%.

Only 44% of people on Palm Island have received two doses of a Covid vaccine and health teams will go door to door later this week in an attempt to lift the rate. Queensland reported 4,249 new Covid cases in the 24 hours to 7pm on Sunday. The state also reported a suspected Covid death, the first of the new outbreak and only the eighth in Queensland since the onset of the pandemic. The chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said the man in his late 30s died suddenly in his Gold Coast home overnight. The state coroner is investigating the circumstances. Gerrard said the rapid spread of the Omicron variant was likely to continue and peak at “very large numbers” in late January or early February. Of more than 20,000 active cases in Queensland, only 10 people were in intensive care on Monday and only one of those required a ventilator. “We are expecting in the next few weeks very substantial numbers of people are going to be infected. I think we just have to assume that all of us are going to be exposed in the next few weeks,” Gerrard said. “The Omicron strain is so different. The modelling is very difficult to interpret. All I can say is that we can expect very large numbers of cases and in the majority of cases, the vast majority of cases, the symptoms will be mild. So clearly the vaccine is working.” Gerrard said the outbreak on Palm Island was “not surprising”. “It’s going to spread there as it has elsewhere,” he said. The Palm Island mayor, Mislam Sam, told the ABC the mood on the island was tense. “I’ve been out checking on everyone … getting out there and just allaying some fears that might be growing in the community,” he said. “We’ve got a high population with serious underlying health issues, so no doubt it’s going to be stressing and depressing for most of my community. “We always forecast that one case could turn to 100 overnight because of how closely connected our community is and the level of overcrowding in houses.” Asked what the government was doing to help vulnerable people in overcrowded homes in Indigenous communities, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said those people should get vaccinated. “What we’re doing is telling people to go and get vaccinated. We have … given every Queenslander in this state the opportunity to get vaccinated,” she said. “Unfortunately, there has been some negative social media posts going around that have had a negative impact [on vaccination rates] in our Indigenous communities. “I’m now urging people in those Indigenous communities to ignore those social media posts and immediately go and get your vaccination.” Palaszczuk announced the state had secured 18m rapid antigen tests that would be supplied free to some people, including identified close contacts, at public testing centres.",News/Australia news,"‘All of us are going to be exposed’ to Omicron, Queensland chief health officer warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/all-of-us-are-going-to-be-exposed-to-omicron-queensland-chief-health-officer-warns
1/3/2022,"A British DJ who triggered New Zealand’s first Omicron scare after breaking home isolation rules will not be prosecuted for the time being, authorities say. “The Ministry of Health does not plan to refer this case to the police at this stage,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that it “needs to balance the deterrence effect from any potential prosecution with enabling an environment that does not discourage future cases from assisting with the public health response to Covid-19”.  Robert Etheridge, also known as DJ Dimension, arrived in New Zealand on 16 December and spent seven days in one of the country’s managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) facilities, where he returned three negative Covid test results, Stuff reported. After leaving MIQ he was required to spend three days in home isolation but did not wait to receive a negative day-nine test – as also required – before entering the community. According to the ministry, he visited a series of venues in Auckland over two days including nightclubs, a shopping precinct and restaurants before receiving a positive test result on 27 December and being returned to MIQ. Etheridge, who had been due to play at the Rhythm and Alps festival near Wanaka last week, apologised to “those who I have inadvertently put at risk as a result of my misunderstandings”. “I realise the gravity of the situation and I am deeply regretful to those who have been impacted.” In an earlier statement he said: “After completing my 10-day isolation, and of the understanding that I had completed my quarantine, I entered the community. To my shock and enormous concern, I unexpectedly received a positive test on day 12, two days after my isolation period had ended.” His case triggered outrage in New Zealand, which has frequently been praised for its pandemic response and which only recently lifted lockdown restrictions on Auckland, its largest city, after a Delta outbreak. Despite identifying dozens of close contacts, the ministry said on Monday that none had so far tested positive for the virus. Covid cases are currently trending downwards in New Zealand, with just 27 new community cases announced on Monday and 24 at the border.",News/World news,British DJ escapes prosecution after sparking New Zealand’s first Omicron scare,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/british-dj-escapes-prosecution-after-sparking-new-zealands-first-omicron-scare
