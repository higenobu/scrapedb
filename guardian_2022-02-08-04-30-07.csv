2/8/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has warned against expecting “miracles” in his talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow aimed at fending off a Russian attack on Ukraine. The French president had been upbeat about the chances of finding a compromise over European security that would persuade Putin not to order an invasion but, on arrival in Moscow on Monday, Macron sought to play down expectations.  “We can prevent some things in the short term,” he said in Moscow, but added: “I don’t think there are short-term victories. “I don’t believe in spontaneous miracles. There is lots of tensions, nervousness,” Macron added. Before the high-stakes meeting, ​Moscow had​ also​ sought to temper expectations.​​“The situation is too complex to expect decisive breakthroughs in the course of one meeting​,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.​ ​“​In recent days there has been nothing new on the topic of security guarantees for Russia, our western interlocutors prefer not to mention this topic.​” Macron’s meeting with Putin was part of a frenetic day of diplomacy under the shadow of a possible new war in Europe. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz was meeting Joe Biden at the White House and the country’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Kyiv, assuring the Ukrainian government of support. Meanwhile, the US and the EU held talks in Washington on how to keep energy supplies flowing to Europe if Russian turned off the flow of natural gas. Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, led the European delegation to Washington to discuss emergency energy supplies to the continent if the pipeline running through Ukraine was severed. “We are living by understanding the most dangerous moment for the security in Europe after the end of the cold war,” Borrell said, giving a new estimate of the Russian military buildup. “Nobody masses 140,000 heavily armed soldiers on the border of a country, at the same time [as questioning] the independence to this country in a way that certainly represents a strong threat,” Borrell said, adding that the Russian troops were not there “to have tea”. He said that European gas prices were already six to 10 times higher than a year ago, adding urgency to the need to diversify energy sources. “When Russia halted gas supplies over a dispute with Ukraine in 2009, people died from the cold. And when energy supplies fail, economies falter,” the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. “We’re determined to prevent that from happening and to mitigate the impact on energy supplies and prices should Russia choose to cut natural gas supplies to Europe more than it already has.” The US and EU are trying to secure short notice deliveries of liquified natural gas and agreements to pool reserves in the face of limits on the supply for the east. In their White House meeting, Biden and Scholz were expected to discuss the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which has been built but not yet opened. While the US has been adamant it would not open if Russia carries out an attack, the German government has been less clear, with Scholz appealing for “strategic ambiguity”. Washington, meanwhile, has been opaque on whether it would seek to stop Nord Stream 2 from functioning even if Putin withdrew his troops. “If we are in the happy situation where there is not a Russian invasion and we are able to move along the diplomatic path, we will continue to engage in conversations with Germany and our European partners about this issue more broadly,” a senior US administration official said before the summit meeting.",News/World news,Macron warns don’t expect ‘miracles’ in talks with Putin over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/macron-warns-dont-expect-miracles-in-talks-with-putin-over-ukraine
2/8/2022,"The NHS has some catching up to do. With 6 million people in England currently on waiting lists, and another 1.5 million in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the mismatch between demand and supply in the health system is one of the most serious problems facing the country. This means it is also one of the biggest challenges for ministers, who know that NHS delays, and the problems including deaths that these cause, will be a huge issue – perhaps the single biggest issue – in the next general election. So it is no wonder that the government is trying to force NHS England’s bosses to fix the problem quickly. Publication of a recovery plan for elective (non-emergency) hospital treatment has already been delayed once. Over the weekend it emerged that a sticking point in negotiations is the deadline that will be imposed for reducing waiting times. Waits of more than two years will have been dealt with by the end of March. But ministers’ demand that waits of more than one year should also be eliminated by March 2024 has met with resistance. That is because the length of time that a person has been waiting is not an indication of their level of need. And if people who have been waiting for a long time for non-urgent treatment are prioritised, then those who are more ill but have been slower to come forward will suffer.  The extent of the delays is nothing short of a scandal. Being told that you may have cancer is highly distressing; the two-week maximum waiting time for patients in these circumstances to see an oncologist exists for a reason. For half-a-million people in England to have waited longer than this, as new research suggests that they have done over the past year, is a sign of a brewing crisis. So are lengthy queues for operations such as hip replacements, which have left thousands of people who ought to have been fitted with new joints trapped in pain and disability. But the NHS is right to push back against unrealistic commitments. Political expediency must not be allowed to trump clinical judgments. And ministers must be prevented from passing the buck, and blame for departmental mistakes, to the NHS. The pandemic has dramatically worsened conditions on the ground, putting unprecedented pressure on primary care and hospitals. But the problems of under-resourcing and lack of long-term planning predate Covid. A health and social care workforce strategy was promised in 2019, as an adjunct to a long-term plan that placed staffing front and centre. But the work done in this area by Dido Harding at NHS Improvement was feeble, and the plan is yet to arrive. An amendment to the health and care bill proposed by Jeremy Hunt, who chairs the health select committee, would have increased transparency by requiring regular updates on vacancies and training places – but the government voted it down in November. Labour should maximise pressure on this point and others, both in the House of Lords and when the bill returns to the Commons. The truth is that Tory resistance to forward planning, as well as insufficient spending, lies at the heart of the NHS’s difficulties. With 100,000 job vacancies, and worrying reports about burnout among staff, Sajid Javid and his colleagues should be listening carefully to health bosses. Instead, they combine a high-handed approach to NHS management with over-enthusiasm for big business – as was illustrated by Mr Javid’s recent decision to force through a deal with the private sector despite warnings about costs. Overall, the conduct of the government suggests that the problems of most interest to it are not those facing the NHS. They are the problems facing ministers and their party.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on repairing the NHS: ministers are the problem | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-repairing-the-nhs-ministers-are-the-problem
2/8/2022,"In the 1992 sci-fi dystopia Snow Crash, the author Neal Stephenson imagined a bleak 21st century where the collapse of the global economy had seen governments fall and their power replaced by a few giant businesses. The book is notable for prescience, anticipating the adoption of what was then seen as outlandish technologies like the wireless internet, cryptocurrencies and smartphones, as well as the rise of the gig economy. But it is the book’s prophetic vision of “the metaverse” that has revived interest in the work. That is because Stephenson described the online virtual reality experience that almost every tech giant today wishes to commercially exploit. Last October, Microsoft announced that users of its Teams online meetings app would be able to turn themselves into avatars – the term Stephenson popularised in Snow Crash – to encourage users into virtual interaction. Days later Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder, rebranded his company as Meta, with a focus on the potential for virtual worlds.  Mr Zuckerberg wants to convince the world that he has found new ways to make money – a quest that has become more urgent since last week it was revealed that the company’s user base may not just have plateaued but is starting to decline. This is in part because many Apple iPhone owners choose to opt out of being tracked by applications like Facebook and younger people prefer to spend time on the Chinese-owned social media network TikTok. Facebook users’ engagement provides the personal data used to target advertising. Mr Zuckerberg’s Meta rebrand is meant to signal that he will improve his firm’s targeting and measurement techniques – and extract more revenue from its users. However, the metaverse may not be the future. The corporate version of social media has been blamed, with some justification, for rotting democracy from within. Because Facebook, Twitter and YouTube loom so large in the public imagination, there exists a “blind spot”, suggests computer scientist Ethan Zuckerman, for alternative models. Yet they are here. Tim Berners-Lee, the web’s inventor, wants to wrest power back from big tech and put people in control of their personal data. Other decentralised platforms – such as Mastodon – make it possible to create online communities with different rules. Progressive Twitter users in India switched in 2019 to mstdn.social after a supporter was suspended. However, the biggest decentralised social network is Gab, which serves de-platformed rightwing extremists. There are also social media platforms built around cryptocurrency/blockchain capitalism, which currently has a prohibitively large carbon footprint. Contributors to such sites are typically rewarded with tokens, theoretically enabling high-quality content to be rewarded. However, this model has its downsides: notably that voting power is proportional to currency holdings. When Steemit, one of the original crypto-sites, was bought out, its new owner used his market power to move it his own blockchain system – precipitating a walkout by users. Mr Zuckerman’s wish is for “lots more social networks” that are explicitly governed by the communities who are working with them and offer tools that give more control over what is seen and how it is seen. He thinks that a period of fertile creativity may produce a new, more cooperative form of social media. One hopes he is right.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on social media’s metaverse: it may remain science fiction | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/07/the-guardian-view-on-social-medias-metaverse-it-may-remain-science-fiction
2/8/2022,"One detail within the hike in energy bills hasn’t received enough attention. While the surge in wholesale gas prices is, by a wide margin, the biggest driver, let’s not overlook the contribution from the cost of clearing up the mess of 29 corporate failures in the sector. Those costs also fall on customers. The infuriating element is charges for lost credit balances – in other words, money taken from customers via direct debit that should have been in place when a supplier failed. In practice, sums have been missing in many instances. Some companies, it seems, have played fast and loose with their working capital arrangements.  Customers of the failed companies do not lose a penny when they are transferred to a new supplier via Ofgem’s “supplier of last resort” mechanism, it should be said. Instead, the missing balances are replaced, as it were, via charges on everybody’s bills. In effect, we all pay for the missing millions. How much are we talking about? So far, not much: only £2.45 per customer (or about £54m in aggregate) was included within the £68 “supplier of last resort levy” that formed part of last week’s near-£700 hike in the price cap. The bulk of the levy covered new suppliers’ weightier costs of buying energy for customers who arrived unexpectedly. But the full extent of the missing balances is still to emerge as numbers are reconciled with administrators’ reports and so on. By the end of the process, we could be talking about serious sums. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, estimated last October that almost £400m of customer credit had gone. But that was at a point when only 15 rivals had failed. The figure, almost certainly, will be higher now. If these were banks collapsing without customers’ deposits, argued O’Shea, it would be “a national scandal”. Spot on. It’s not as if Ofgem was unaware of the danger. In March last year – so a few months before gas prices surged – the regulator announced it was “concerned that some suppliers may use customers’ surplus credit balances to fund otherwise unsustainable business practices”. That concern was well-founded: the predictable car crash happened. MPs on the business and energy select committee could usefully try to force more transparency when Ofgem chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, is one of their witnesses on Tuesday. A few questions: what’s a fair estimate of the missing balances? Is there any hope of recovering any? Why did Ofgem not insist on hard ring-fencing rules years ago? And why will it take until spring to design proper protections? Whatever you do, don’t appoint an insider as your next chief executive, advised Elliott Advisors. Taylor Wimpey has ignored the instruction from the supposedly fearsome New York activist hedge fund. Jennie Daly, currently operations director, will succeed long-serving Pete Redfern, becoming the first woman to lead a major UK housebuilder. In the circumstances, Elliott’s reaction was almost gentle. It said it expects to see Taylor Wimpey “take the necessary steps to deliver improved value for shareholders”, which could be said of almost any company at any time. It now sees the appointment of new non-executive directors as “critical to this process”. Elliott’s restraint is sensible. Boards propose chief executives and there’s no mileage in disputing the principle, especially when you’re merely a “top five” shareholder and decline to say how much you actually control. Besides, Daly, despite her low profile, may turn out to have ideas that Elliott likes. The demand that it had absolutely had to be outsider was always odd if Elliott had nobody particular in mind. Certainly one name touted by others, Dave Jenkinson, was a non-starter. As deputy to £75m boss Jeff Fairburn at Persimmon, he collected £40m a few years ago from the same wildly over-the-top incentive scheme. Taylor Wimpey, underperformer or not, didn’t need that cure. Alan Cook’s position as chairman of LV= has been untenable for a while. The moment came last December when he failed to get sufficient backing from members of the mutual insurer for a takeover by private equity firm Bain Capital. A boardroom clear-out, which swept away half the board on Monday, was inevitable. The survivor is chief executive Mark Hartigan, presumably because somebody has to run the shop while talks take place with fellow mutual Royal London on an alternative deal. If the new negotiations don’t work out, however, incoming chair Seamus Creedon would be well-advised to rethink his loyalty to Hartigan – the Bain fiasco was as much his as it was Cook’s.",News/Business,Who pays for lost credit balances at failed energy companies?

2/8/2022,"Ralf Rangnick does not believe Manchester United require an overhaul in the summer window to compete for the title next season despite being 19 points behind Manchester City with 16 games left to play of this campaign. United’s position means it will realistically be a decade at least since they were last league champions. And with the team knocked out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough on Friday, which follows being eliminated from the Carabao Cup, their trophy drought is set to stretch to six years unless an unlikely Champions League triumph is achieved.  Given all of this Rangnick was asked if the squad required major surgery to challenge for a 21st title next season. “I don’t think so. Overall, the development of the team and its performances the last couple of weeks have improved,” the 63-year-old said. “There are two points of criticism that we have to face regarding the Middlesbrough defeat. One: we wasted too many clear-cut chances – we had 22 shots inside the box, 10 were massive opportunities, and we should easily have been 3-0 up at half-time. It should have been 6-1 or 6-2 by the end. “And the other one is 10 seconds before we conceded, it was a perfect counter-pressing situation inside their half, we took time away from them but not the ball and eight seconds later we were outnumbered in our box. Those are the two things I fault the team with. But we invested a week into the gameplan and many of the things we worked on were shown against Middlesbrough.” The interim manager will include Jesse Lingard and Edinson Cavani in United’s squad for the trip to Burnley on Tuesday after they were granted extra time off and missed the Middlesbrough defeat. Cavani was excused because of jet lag after playing for Uruguay while Rangnick stated Lingard had asked not to be considered in order to clear his head after not being allowed a loan move in January. Lingard, though, subsequently claimed on Twitter that it was the club who wanted him to take the break. Asked if the striker and midfielder will travel to Turf Moor, Rangnick said: “They’re both available and will be part of the squad. Both are top professionals and have been training well. With regard to Jesse, I have a very good relationship with him, he knows I would have been willing to let him go [on loan] at least until the issue with Mason [Greenwood] came up. He [Lingard] mentioned some personal issues [why he wanted a break]. There are no problems whatsoever between myself and Jesse and vice versa.”",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick says Manchester United can compete for league title next season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/07/ralf-rangnick-says-manchester-united-can-compete-for-league-title-next-season
2/8/2022,"Protesters against Covid vaccine mandates for truckers have defied government calls for them to end an 11-day occupation of Canada’s capital, a day after the city’s mayor declared a state of emergency and promised to “get the city back”. Ottawa police have described the protest as a “siege” on the city, where hundreds of trucks and cars have blockaded the downtown areas. On Sunday, Mayor Jim Watson warned that officials were “losing this battle”, and a civil class-action lawsuit was filed against protesters over the incessant horn blasting and disruption to daily life.  But on Monday morning a 10am deadline – which asked protesters to leave of their own volition or face damages of nearly C$10m (US$7.9m) – came and went with no sign that an end to the protest was at hand. Dozens of big-rig trucks, RVs and pickups remained parked in front of Parliament Hill and nearby streets, and protesters showed no signs of leaving. Ron, a highway rescue worker from a small community in rural British Columbia, was taking shelter at a disused bus stop. (Services have been suspended because buses are unable to reach the city centre.) “I came here for my grandbabies,” he said, arguing that Canadians had been robbed of making medical choices. “I don’t want them live under the thumb of the government.” Canada has one of the world’s highest rates of vaccination against Covid-19, (some 85% of the country’s truckers are vaccinated) and public health measures have been broadly supported. But Ron teared up describing an elderly neighbour who died two days after being vaccinated. A doctor said she had died of a rapid onset of cancer, but Ron said that he didn’t believe him. The “freedom convoy” began in the final week of January as a demonstration against vaccine mandates but has morphed into protest against broader public health measures – and as a rallying point for conspiracy theorists and opponents of the government of Justin Trudeau. Swastikas, Confederate flags and QAnon symbols have all been seen at the protests. Hundreds of signs hung from the front gates of parliament, accusing the government of stripping away Canada’s freedoms and demanding that people “wake up”. With temperatures hovering below freezing, protesters warmed up around small fires. One homemade sign on a protester’s car appeared to equate the vaccine mandate with the Nazi persecution of the Jews. A red-haired man who did not give his name said he had travelled from Alberta – more than 3,000km away – to join the protest. He said that staying on might “financially break” him, but argued that a “slippery slope” of worse outcomes would await if vaccines mandates were allowed to remain in force. “They’re calling us xenophobes but how could xenophobes be uniting the world?” he said. The protests have drawn considerable support from US groups opposing Covid-19 restrictions and prominent Republican figures including Ted Cruz, Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump, who has called Trudeau, a “far-left lunatic” who had “destroyed Canada with insane Covid mandates”. Gerald Butts, a former senior adviser to Trudeau, tweeted: “For some senior American politicians, patriotism means renting a mob to put a G7 capital under siege.” Many small businesses in the downtown core of the city remained shuttered on Monday, with owners preferring to shut down than risk altercations with the protesters – who often refuse to wear masks inside. Anger was growing among local residents at the failure of the police and city officials to disperse the protest, amid reports that truckers and their supporters had harassed or threatened locals. Alexa Reedman, who was out walking her dog not far from the protest, had no patience with the protesters. “They should just leave. Now.” She described an atmosphere of constant stress over the past week. “You just don’t feel comfortable – you don’t feel 100% safe any more. It was initially called a protest, but when people use the word ‘occupation’ that really resonates – it does feel like an occupation. You just can’t live normally,” she said. After residents of a nearby apartment block argued with truckers on Sunday night over the constant barrage of airhorns, two protesters allegedly started a fire in the building’s lobby and taped the doors shut. Ottawa police said on Monday that its arson unit was investigating. But the convoy has also won supporters: thousands of people came to the protest site on Saturday. The convoy has also gained millions of dollars in crowdfunding support, currently being gathered by a Christian crowdfunding site called GiveSendGo, after the original GoFundMe which amassed more than $10m was cancelled. Last week, Ottawa police said the crowdfunding had attracted “significant” support from the US. In the few days since the new crowdfunding page was launched, supporters have sent in nearly $5m. On Monday, GiveSendGo tweeted “money for what you’re passionate about. We won’t stop you like others will!” Directly in front of parliament, the driver of a semi-tractor parked in the road was sounding his horn and revving his engine, sending out plumes of black exhaust. Emblazoned on the side of the vehicle was the slogan: “God-given IMMUNITY works best.” An elderly man in a face mask walked past, holding a sign saying: “Truckers go home.”",News/World news,Ottawa protesters defy deadline to end occupation of capital,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/ottawa-protesters-defy-deadline-end-occupation-capital
2/8/2022,"A tourist from Arizona won $229,000 on a Las Vegas slot machine but walked away unaware of his windfall, due to an error in the machine. It took nearly three weeks for gaming board agents to track him down and enrich him.  On 8 January, Robert Taylor hit a jackpot on a slot machine at the Treasure Island Hotel & Casino on the Vegas strip. But the “slot machine experienced a malfunction that prevented Mr Taylor and casino personnel from realizing that a progressive jackpot had been won”, the Nevada Gaming Control Board said. “By the time an extensive review of the slot machine and the communications technology was completed, confirming the jackpot had been won, Mr Taylor had returned home to Arizona.” The casino struggled to identify its lucky patron. The gaming board launched an extensive investigation that included a review of hours of surveillance footage across numerous properties; witness interviews; a study of electronic purchase records; and analysis of ride-share data obtained by the Nevada Transportation Authority. Eventually, the investigation was able to identify Taylor as the lucky casino patron. He was notified on 28 January, nearly three weeks after his win. “The Nevada Gaming Control Board is charged with the strict regulation of the gaming industry, the protection of the gaming public, and ensuring that the industry benefits the state of Nevada,” said James Taylor, chief of enforcement for the board. “I commend the agents of the enforcement division … for ensuring that the public trust in the gaming industry remains strong by spending countless hours over two weeks to ensure that a patron is awarded winnings owed to him. “I’d also like to thank the Nevada Transportation Authority for their assistance in confirming the identity of the patron. This has been a great example of government working together for the benefit of the public.” Robert Taylor will return to Las Vegas to collect his $229,368.52 jackpot, according to gaming officials. The Nevada gambling industry has recovered since the start of the pandemic. In a report released last month, the state gaming board revealed that casinos “won” – or earned – a record $13.4bn in 2021, compared to $12bn in 2019. “This represents an all-time record for gaming win, beating the previous record set during calendar 2007 which totaled $12.8bn,” board analyst Michael Lawton said. He attributed the success to vaccine rollouts which have reduced capacity limits in casinos, as well as strong gambling demand due to “healthy consumer savings as a result of stimulus payments and the sustained rebound of leisure travel”.",News/US news,"Las Vegas casino tracks down tourist who won $229,000 without knowing",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/las-vegas-tourist-jackpot-winner-slot-machine
2/8/2022,"Keir Starmer has had to be bundled into a police car after protesters surrounded him near parliament and shouted at him that he “protected paedophiles”. In an incident that could reignite anger over Boris Johnson’s comments that the Labour leader failed to prosecute the child abuser Jimmy Savile, Starmer was rescued by police after an encounter with anti-vaccination protesters.  One witness said a protester carried a hangman’s noose prop which another protester had joked was for Starmer. The Labour leader did not respond the the protesters and was surrounded by police, along with the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy. There were shouts of “traitor” at Starmer and “Jimmy Savile” – who Johnson said Starmer had failed to prosecute when he was director of public prosecutions. Starmer did not take the decision but had apologised for institutional failings after Savile’s persistent sexual abuse was revealed. MPs have criticised Johnson for failing to apologise for the jibe in the House of Commons last week. The comment was criticised by three former chief whips and Munira Mirza, one of Johnson’s closest aides, who headed the No 10 policy unit, quit last week having urged Johnson to retract. Cabinet ministers have also expressed unease at the comments, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who said during a national press conference: “I wouldn’t have said it.” The former chief whip Julian Smith, who had called on Johnson to apologise, tweeted: “What happened to Keir Starmer tonight outside parliament is appalling. It is really important for our democracy & for his security that the false Savile slurs made against him are withdrawn in full.” The Labour MP Chris Bryant tweeted that Johnson’s comments were directly responsible for circulating links between Starmer and Savile, which had originally appeared on far right websites. “This is appalling. People were shouting all sorts at Keir, including ‘Jimmy Savile’. This is what happens when a prime minister descends into the gutter and recycles lies from hard-right conspiracy theorists. Political poison has an effect. Johnson has no moral compass,” he wrote. The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also blamed Johnson for amplifying false claims. “This is what happens when fake news is amplified and given credibility by people who should know better. Solidarity with Keir Starmer and David Lammy. Thank you to the Met officers for their swift intervention.” A spokesperson for the Met police said: “A man who had been surrounded by a group of protesters near to New Scotland Yard, was taken away from the scene by a police car. “A man and a woman were arrested at the scene for assault of an emergency worker after a traffic cone was thrown at a police officer.
