2/9/2022,"Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) quietly shut down the only plant making usable batches of its COVID-19 vaccine, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the decision. The NYT report said the halt is temporary, with the Leiden plant expected to start making the vaccine again after a few months. The paper added that it was unclear whether the pause has impacted vaccine supplies yet, thanks to stockpiles. According to the report, the facility in the Dutch city of Leiden has instead been making an experimental but potentially more profitable vaccine to protect against an unrelated virus. Last month, the Company forecasted as much as .5 billion in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine in 2022. J&J reported sales of $2.39 billion for the COVID shot in 2021, missing its target of $2.5 billion. With the Leiden plant temporarily unavailable, it could reduce the supply of the J&J vaccine by a few hundred million doses, the NYT report said, citing one of the people familiar with the decision. Price Action: JNJ shares are up 0.11% at $171.25 during the market session on the last check Tuesday.
