3/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- As equity markets sink around the world, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. strategists say a perfect storm looks to be gathering.

This is a potential “game-changer,” eroding their conviction on the prospects of risk assets, they wrote. Earnings delivery is “paramount” at a time when liquidity is being sucked out by central banks across the world, the Citi strategists said. “Removing this support could leave some indices floating on air.” A ferocious rally in developed market stocks came to an abrupt end at the start of this year amid concerns that record inflation readings will cause central banks to aggressively tighten policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another spike in commodity prices, adding to fears that economies are heading to a stagflationary shock. Several major benchmark gauges across Europe have dropped more than 20% from their recent highs, while the S&P 500 is hovering around a 10% correction. With gas and oil prices soaring, Citi and Morgan Stanley strategists say “demand destruction” may now be unavoidable. Optimists Wavering “Any relief should be sold,” said Wilson. “We recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal and searching for companies with superior operational efficiency and earnings stability.” While the Morgan Stanley strategist has consistently been one of Wall Street’s most outspoken bears, even optimists are now wavering.

3/8/2022,"Stocks may be well off their highs amid rising concerns on the Russia-Ukraine war, but now doesn't mark a great buying opportunity, warns UBS strategist Stuart Kaiser. ""We are definitely not buyers of the dip at this point. For perspective, we were worried about the first half of this year before the Russia-Ukraine conflict even started just based on the Fed and the growth in inflation dynamics. The geopolitical stuff just reinforces that,"" Kaiser said on Yahoo Finance Live. Markets would seem to agree with Kaiser's hot take. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite declined on Monday, but came off session lows from pre-market trading. Traders piled into safe haven assets, notably gold as prices briefly jumped above $2,000 per ounce for the first time since September 2020. Investors took their cues from spikes in the energy complex on worries the West will ban Russian oil exports. Brent crude oil prices surged to nearly $140 a barrel on Sunday evening, but have since settled to below $130 a barrel. Meanwhile, gas prices have risen to an all-time high. Shares of ExxonMobil, Chevron, Occidental, Transocean and other oil names had some of the most active ticker pages on Yahoo Finance through midday Monday. To be sure, Kaiser isn't alone on the Street in practicing extreme caution on risk-taking. ""Sell any relief rallies from oversold conditions,"" said Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson.

3/8/2022,"A financial research company has raised eyebrows by saying there is a 10pc chance of civilisation being destroyed in a nuclear apocalypse – while urging clients to keep buying shares regardless. BCA Research, a Canadian business, told clients to “stay bullish” on stocks and “largely ignore existential risk” as their investments will become “irrelevant” if the Ukraine crisis leads to nuclear armageddon.

It put the chance of a civilisation-destroying nuclear war in the next 12 months at an “uncomfortably high” one-in-10, as tensions between Russia and the West escalate.

Peter Berezin, chief global strategist at BCA, wrote: “Despite the risk of nuclear war, it makes sense to stay constructive on stocks over the next 12 months.

“If an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] is heading your way, the size and composition of your portfolio becomes irrelevant. Thus, from a purely financial perspective, you should largely ignore existential risk.”

He concluded: “The risk of Armageddon has risen dramatically. Stay bullish on stocks over a 12-month horizon.”

The Kremlin has put Russia’s nuclear forces – the largest in the world – on “high alert” and has argued that Nato’s onslaught of financial sanctions are “akin to an act of war”.

Global stock markets tumbled last week as Vladimir Putin doubles down on the invasion of Ukraine.

The FTSE 100 suffered its worst week since March 2020, when the pandemic first struck with the rout wiping more than £130bn off the UK’s blue-chip shares. Mr Berezin said: “If Putin concludes that he has no future, the risk is that he will decide that no one else should have a future either.”

BCA warned that markets could experience a “freak-out moment” over the next few weeks even if World War III is ultimately avoided.

Defence secretary Ben Wallace has played down the threat of nuclear war, saying Mr Putin is touting his arsenal in a “battle of rhetoric”.

Mr Wallace said last week: “This is predominantly about Putin putting it on the table just to remind people, remind the world, that he has a deterrent.""

3/8/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Some holders of a $1.3 billion Gazprom PJSC bond due Monday said they were fully repaid in dollars, two days after Russian President Vladimir Putin gave issuers the option of paying back foreign-currency debt in rubles. Most Read from Bloomberg China Warns U.S. Against Forming Pacific NATO and Backing Taiwan Stakes Rise as Putin Says His War in Ukraine Will Continue Ukraine Update: Russian Official Threatens Europe Gas Pipeline Ukraine Update: U.S. May Go Alone on Russia Oil Ban; Crude Soars Oil Ends at Decade High as Specter of Russia Ban Rattles Market Bondholders said they received cash to pay off the bonds Monday, according to people with knowledge of the payments, who declined to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The company began the process of repaying them last week, before Putin’s decree, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. A spokesperson for the company didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The bond paid Monday was among those snapped up at distressed prices last week as Wall Street investors eyed buying opportunities amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. loaded up on Russian corporate bonds as hedge funds also scouted targets, Bloomberg reported. Although Gazprom last week was already in the process of servicing the dollar debt maturity and a coupon payment on another bond, there was growing concern that a Saturday decree from Putin allowing borrowers to repay their debt in rubles would disrupt the payment. It underscores just how uncertain investors have been since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prompted the U.S. and its allies to slap multiple sanctions on Moscow, and Moscow’s numerous capital controls introduced within the past two weeks. Adding to the confusion, Russia has also said creditors in countries that haven’t imposed sanctions may be able to receive the payment in foreign currency, provided companies get special permission. The countries deemed “unfriendly” include the U.S., the U.K., Japan and European Union members. Bloomberg spoke to bondholders based in the EU. It’s possible, however, that Gazprom’s payment process was too far along to be impacted by Putin’s recent directives. The payment was meant to be transferred to bondholders by the settlement bank on March 4, a day before Putin’s decree. While the bonds are Gazprom’s, they were issued by Gaz Capital SA, a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Luxembourg. Creditors of a Russian telecommunications company, Yandex NV, said they, too, had received a payment due Thursday on a $1.25 billion bond due 2025. The company is now in talks with bondholders to determine how to handle the potential early redemption of its bonds. The Russian oil and gas producer Rosneft told investors it had begun the repayment process Mar. 3 for a $2 billion bond that matured on Sunday, according to IFR, and that the payment would come through on March 9, after public holidays in Russia the two days before.

3/8/2022,"Mortgage rates hit reverse going into March, ending a string of weekly increases through mid-February. In the week ending 24th February, 30-year fixed rates slid by 13 basis points to 3.76%. 30-year fixed rates had slipped by 3 basis points in the week prior. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 74 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 118 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. Economic data from the U.S took a back seat as demand for the safe havens saw a slide in U.S Treasury yields, which weighed on mortgage rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine weighed heavily on riskier assets in the week. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of 3rd March, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates slid by 13 basis points to 3.76% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 3.02%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates fell by 13 basis points to 3.01% in the week. Rates were up by 67 basis points from 2.34% a year ago. The average fee rose from 0.7 points to 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates declined by 7 basis points to 2.91%. Rates were up by 18 basis points from 2.73% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Geopolitical tensions led to a fall in U.S Treasury yields as investors moved to the safety of bonds. Falling yields led to a decline in mortgage rates. While inflationary pressures remain, the impact of the war in Ukraine has caused market uncertainty. Rates are expected to stay low in the short term but will likely resume the upward trend in the coming months. For the week ending 25th February, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.05% to 4.15%. Points decreased from 0.48 to 0.44 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.09% to 4.15%. Points rose from 0.56 to 0.74 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 3.84% to 3.88%. Points fell from 0.45 to 0.40 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, slipped by 0.7% in the week ending 25th February. The Index tumbled by 13.1% in the previous week. The Refinance Index increased by 1% and was 56% lower than the same week a year ago. In the week prior, the Index had fallen 16%. The refinance share of mortgage activity fell from 50.1% to 49.9%. In the previous week, the share decreased from 52.8 to 50.1%. According to the MBA, Mortgage rates reached multi-year highs, weighing on application activity. As a result of rising rates, the refinance share of applications fell below 50%. Purchase activity remained weak, but the average loan size increased again. The MBA will continue to assess the potential impact on mortgage demand from the sharp drop in interest rates this week due to the invasion of Ukraine. It’s a quiet first half of the week, with stats limited to U.S JOLT’s job openings. Market sentiment towards Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and news updates will remain the key driver. A further escalation of military strikes on Ukraine and responses by NATO, the United Nations, and Western governments would drive demand for bonds and weigh on mortgage rates.
