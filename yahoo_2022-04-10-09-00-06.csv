4/10/2022,"By Dogyun Kim, Daewoung Kim and Hyonhee Shin SEOUL (Reuters) - Plunging prices for Russian crab have South Koreans flocking to seafood markets and restaurants but some consumers are questioning whether to boycott the imports on concerns the purchases indirectly support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The dinner-plate sized king crabs from Russia, along with slightly smaller snow crabs and lobsters, were once a pricey delicacy in South Korea, though they have become more popular at supermarkets and online retailers in recent years. But prices have nearly halved since late February as the United States, European Union and other nations banned Russian seafood imports over the Ukraine invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", and China's lockdown on major cities over coronavirus outbreaks has further boosted shipments to South Korea. Data from the Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market, one of South Korea's largest seafood markets, showed live Russian snow crabs prices fell to 23,000 won ($18.80) per kg (2.2 pounds) at the end of March from 50,000 won ($40.80) in mid-February, before rising slightly this week. The supply more than doubled during that period. The market does not track king crab prices, but Kim Mi-kyeong, who has been running a fish store at Noryangjin for 10 years, said she sold them at 85,000 won ($69.40) per kg, down from 110,000 won ($89.80) two months ago. ""We didn't have enough supplies back then, but a lot more volume has come in from Russia for the last two months. Prices are lower now, so twice as many people are coming,"" she said. Choi Myung-sook, 54, said she could not miss out on getting her favourite king crabs cheaply. ""I hope more Russian seafood will be brought in so that prices will go down even further,"" she said. But others say the government should join global efforts to ban Russian seafood, and that consumers should refrain from buying it. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is set to give a virtual speech to the South Korean parliament on Monday, has urged the international community to ditch Russian exports. South Korea has curbed Russian coal imports and joined other economic and financial sanctions, but did not restrict food. ""We should not buy those crabs,"" said Jung Mi-jung, 40, who said she was visiting the market for other items. ""That's not even a necessity, and Russia waged an unjustifiable war against Ukraine. We should join the boycott.""

4/10/2022,"A horrific incident shocked the Edgewater neighborhood of Miami Sunday and five days later cops are still sorting out what happened. What is known: Courtney Clenney, 25, fatally stabbed her boyfriend, Christian Obumseli, in the shoulder during a fight at their apartment at the El Paraiso. Shaky cellphone video posted by TMZ and taken from a nearby building shows Clenney, wearing only a bra and underwear soaked with blood. Her hands are cuffed behind her back and she is speaking to police. The Michigan native, who was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation, has yet to be charged while police and prosecutors probe the case. “The preliminary investigation determined that both Mr. Obumseli and the female had been involved in a physical altercation,” Miami police said in a statement. What is also known about the recent Texas transplant is that she is a popular model for adult subscription service OnlyFans, known to fans as Courtney Tailor. “Proud Texan! Full-time fitness model and foodie living with my two dogs, Jesse and Ranger,” reads her bio. “I just moved to Miami so I need your positive vibes! Scary BIG change for this ‘lil Texas girl.” Clenney also has a large presence on Instagram with the handle of Courtney Tailor, with two million followers. A brief post shows her active as of Monday, a day after the shocking episode. The most recent snap on her Insta page shows the model roughly a week ago in a pink sundress, contemplating a manicure. “My face thinking about a fresh set of talons… what color should I get?” said the caption. What is to become of her? Clenney’s attorney Frank Prieto said his client is a victim of domestic violence and acted out of fear for her life. “As Courtney struggles with the pain of being a survivor of domestic violence and the aftermath of the events that evening, we ask that the community and Christian’s family allow the police and the state to conduct their independent investigation of the events,” he said. “This is a tragedy for all involved but it was not criminal conduct; Courtney was defending herself and the investigation will reveal exactly that.”",U.S./Miami Herald,Who is Courtney Clenney?
