3/13/2022,"A Ukrainian company that manufacturers medieval armor for sport is now using its materials to produce ""caltrops"" — or ""sharp, six-inch spikes that date back to ancient wars"" — in service of the war effort against Russia, The Washington Post reports. Art of Steel in western Ukraine used to make items like ""silver chain mail, helmets, and other armor for reenactments and show,"" but has instead in the past two weeks produced hundreds of caltrops, which are being chained together and ""placed at checkpoints around Rivne, a city about 210 miles west of Kyiv,"" writes the Post. The intent is for the devices, also called ""hedgehogs,"" to stop or slow Russian vehicles should they try to enter the city, since the metal can pierce tires. ""Ukrainians [are] united in this war,"" an Art of Steel official told the Post. ""Absolutely everyone is trying to help in the fighting places and in the rear. Therefore, any materials are somehow used."" ""With proper use,"" the caltrops ""will help stop [a] column of vehicles or at least delay them for a while,"" the official added. The Art of Steel hedgehogs are just one example of homegrown weaponry Ukrainians are using to defend themselves from Russian aggression. Some volunteers, for example, have begun packing bottles with the materials needed to make Molotov cocktails. The spiky weapons are now at every checkpoint in Rivne, Art of Steel said, per the Post. The company is also making plates for body armor.

3/13/2022,"MSNBC propped up—and then scrubbed—former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul’s false suggestion on Friday that Adolf Hitler did not order the deaths of “ethnic Germans” during the Holocaust while he condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine. McFaul offered his take on The Rachel Maddow Show Friday night, saying he heard a Ukrainian commentator and a Russian journalist say that Hitler did not kill “ethnic Germans” compared to Putin’s attacks against Russian-speaking Ukrainian citizens. McFaul expressed his agreement with the false sentiment, despite people throughout Europe—including in Germany—suffering violent deaths during the Holocaust. MSNBC later tweeted out McFaul’s statement without attribution Friday night, instead linking to a clip of his comments. “One difference between Putin and Hitler is that Hitler didn’t kill ethnic Germans, German-speaking people,” the tweet, which has since been deleted, read. “Putin slaughters the very people he said he has come to liberate.” McFaul was promptly bashed on Twitter for believing the statement was permissible in the first place. He initially apologized for the remarks Saturday morning, attributing the ignorance of history, after a career in international diplomacy, to a long day of television appearances. “I slipped late last night and violated an unwritten taboo—never compare Hitler with anyone,” he tweeted. “I agree. He was incomparably evil. I won’t do it again.” After multiple hours of arguing with critics on Twitter about his comments, he later admitted he did not know Hitler killed Germans from many different ethnic backgrounds and doubled down on never comparing things to Hitler again. “I made a mistake. I apologize. I will never make comparisons to Hitler again,” he wrote. “Without historical analogizing, I will keep my analysis and comments focused on the present evil—Putin.” The Rachel Maddow Show also apologized for the tweet, acknowledging Hitler’s slaughter of Germans and saying “the historical record is clear.” “We tweeted out part of an inaccurate statement made last night by former Ambassador Michael McFaul without attribution, and we regret doing so,” it tweeted. “We have since removed the tweet.” MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
