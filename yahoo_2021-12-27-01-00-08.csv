TITUSVILLE — By the time he had run roughly 60 grueling miles through the Enchanted Forest Sanctuary, Earl Blewett became delirious in the darkness — he had struck his head twice and rolled his ankle during the Ancient Oaks 100-Mile Endurance Run. Blewett's memories are hazy: He erroneously thought he had finished the ultramarathon that night of Dec. 18, driven his car back to his hotel room, and laid down in bed. But when the Oklahoma college professor groggily woke up the next day, he discovered he had actually fallen asleep somewhere in the dense woods — ""the bed was just this big pile of sticks."" Injured, dehydrated and possibly concussed, Blewett had no clue he was the subject of an extensive search-and-rescue campaign across the 470-acre wilderness preserve. Titusville police officers and firefighters, the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, volunteers and dogs searched the forest Sunday until nightfall for the missing 57-year-old runner, to no avail. Then Monday morning, Blewett was spotted by a security guard behind Knight's Armament Co., off the south side of State Road 405 near the Enchanted Forest Sanctuary. Blewett was in a state of delirium, Titusville Police Sgt. Timothy Werring said during a press conference that afternoon. Earl Blewett found alive: Missing runner found alive after disappearing during Titusville 100-mile endurance run Infrastructure upgrade: Ceremony kicks off $126 million NASA Causeway replacement project on State Road 405 “A snake could have been bad, had I gotten bitten. Or, if I was confused and fell in the canal. It could have gone real badly,"" Blewett said during a phone interview from his hospital room at Parrish Medical Center. ""I’m glad it ended as well as it did. It was not how I had planned to spend my pre-Christmas."" Blewett was still at the hospital on Christmas Day. He said he spent the week recovering from kidney damages, a severely sprained ankle with cellulitis, and minor injuries. Bloody cuts laced his forehead and nose. “I hit my head a couple of times pretty hard. That’s what led to all this, I think — you can only concuss yourself so much,"" Blewett said. ""And I didn't realize it was as bad as it was. I was running really well. I was very, very happy with how I was running,"" he said. “I fell and did a really good face plant. (And) then I walked into a sign. That really hurt. So I think the head trauma was probably cumulative, and tied in with the trauma from the sprained ankle. ""I laid down and basically slept all Sunday and missed the whole day. So that's not normal by any measure. Not even in my world,"" he said. Blewett said Saturday his kidneys were improving and family members had flown to the Space Coast to visit him. He said he hopes doctors discharge him from the hospital as soon as Monday. Blewett, who lives in Tulsa, Okla., is a professor of microbiology at Oklahoma State University. He ran his first ultramarathon in 1993, and he has completed about 80 throughout his running career. In October, Blewett finished in 45th place out of 58 finishers in the Mines of Spain 100-Mile Endurance Run near Dubuque, Iowa. Participants completed five laps of a 20-mile loop along the Mississippi River Valley. Blewett finished that 100-mile ultramarathon in 30 hours, 32 minutes and 33 seconds. Back in 1995, Belwett said he suffered a head injury and concussion during an Ironman Canada triathlon, and he developed hypernatremia. Marked by a high concentration of sodium in the bloodstream, this electrolyte imbalance can cause muscle weakness, confusion, lethargy and unconsciousness. Titusville's Ancient Oaks 100-Mile Endurance Run is an invitation-only ultramarathon. The race started at 7 a.m. Dec. 18, and runners attempted to finish 29 loops of a 3.46-mile trail course — totaling 100.34 miles — in the Enchanted Forest Nature Sanctuary within 32 hours. Brevard County's Environmentally Endangered Lands program established the sanctuary, which contains oak scrub, mesic and hydric hammock, wet prairie and pine flatwood habitats, creeks and the Addison Canal. Blewett said he rolled his ankle about Lap 14 or thereabouts, but he continued to run. He was last seen on the trail course about 9:30 p.m. that Saturday. “I was running on Lap 18. And somewhere in there, I thought I finished the race and I drove my car to my hotel room. Except that I didn't go to a hotel room, and I didn't drive the car,"" Blewett recalled. “I went in and laid down on a bed. And when I woke up, the bed was just this big pile of sticks. And I was in the bush. My ankle had swollen so much I couldn't walk,"" he said. ""I just I figured I had a concussion, and I just laid down and woke up Sunday night."" Werring said Sunday's search effort within Enchanted Forest Sanctuary included grid searches, K-9s, ATVs and Brevard sheriff's mounted patrols. Race volunteers also searched the running loop, trails that were not used during the race, and areas outside the park. Race director Mike Melton said it was ""astounding"" that Blewett emerged from the Titusville forest two days after turning up missing. ""I don't know that we'll ever know the timeline of where Earl was, when he left the park, when he crossed the road, when he fell and hit his head, how many times he fell, when he damaged his ankle, if he damaged it further later on, and so on,"" Melton said. In the 23-year history of the Ancient Oaks 100-Mile Endurance Run, Melton said Blewett's disappearance was only the second incident that required emergency-services personnel. In the other incident, a runner from the Naples area became dehydrated three or four years ago. “I’d just like to thank all the people who went out looking for me. I’m sorry I disrupted their weekend. I’ve never had anything happen like this before,"" Blewett said. “I had to promise my wife I’ll buy a (satellite-tracking) spot locator and wear it. I was running a 3½-mile loop in a park. I really, really didn't expect to get lost."" Rick Neale is the South Brevard Watchdog Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY (for more of his stories, click here.)

12/27/2021,"Californians will ring in the new year with the unfurling of a groundbreaking law that will change how they dispose of their organic waste, particularly leftover food and kitchen scraps. Senate Bill 1383 requires all residents and businesses to separate such “green” waste from other trash, but the program will be rolled out gradually for homes and businesses in the coming months, with the actual startup date varying, depending on the location of your home or business. Fines can be levied for failing to separate organic refuse from other trash. But those charges aren’t scheduled to begin until 2024. CalRecycle, the state agency overseeing the change, has lots of information about the new requirements on its website. Others offering composting solutions include LA Compost — which gives instructions on home composting and also offers community hubs where organic material can be dropped — and CompostableLA, which provides a home pickup service in some neighborhoods, for a fee. Residents and businesspeople should check with their local governments, and with waste haulers, to find out the specific rules for their communities. Here are some frequently asked questions about the new requirements, with answers from Los Angeles County Public Works and the Los Angeles City Bureau of Sanitation. Isn’t garbage just garbage? Why are California lawmakers requiring us to separate organic waste from the rest of our trash? Scientists have found that organic waste dumped into traditional landfills decomposes and creates methane, a super-pollutant with as much as 80 times the Earth-warming potency of carbon dioxide. To slow the advance of global warming, the state wants to redirect the material to composting centers or anaerobic digestion facilities, where it can help sink carbon back into the Earth or capture natural gas to — for instance — power trash trucks. When do I need to begin separating my kitchen waste from other trash? The opening date for organics diversion varies, depending on where you live. San Francisco, Berkeley, Costa Mesa and other communities have been recycling kitchen waste via curbside green bins for years. Those bins also accommodate yard trimmings. Los Angeles County Public Works officials say homes in unincorporated communities will get notices over the first half of 2022 telling them when, and how, to segregate their food waste. Some businesses in L.A. County already have voluntary recycling of food waste, a program that will become mandatory over the course of the new year. In the city of Los Angeles, the Bureau of Sanitation plans to present a plan early next year to expand food waste recycling from 18,000 homes now in a pilot program to the remaining 730,000 customers. That curbside program should begin by next summer. In the meantime, residents can throw kitchen waste in their regular trash bins, to be hauled to the landfill. They also have the option of composting in their yards, though the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the shutdown of city composting workshops (and the discounted composting bins that went with them). In March, the Bureau of Sanitation plans to work with a nonprofit to collect food scraps at 25 neighborhood farmers markets and composting centers. Those locations will be announced later. What if I live in an apartment building or condo complex? In unincorporated communities in L.A. County, the rules for multifamily housing are still being finalized. It’s expected that at least some waste haulers will continue to allow food waste to be mixed with other trash, to be separated later at processing facilities so it can be recycled. In the city of Los Angeles, multifamily units handled by service providers under the recycLA program are now encouraged to recycle food scraps. Residents need to contact their service provider to subscribe to the program. Can’t climate-warming gases also be curtailed by simply reducing food waste? Yes. Keith Lilley, deputy director of Los Angeles County Public Works, urges residents and businesses to “shop purposefully, store food mindfully, preserve food and learn how to manage excess food.” Are there alternatives to having the kitchen and yard waste trucked away? Yes. Food scraps can be composted at home or taken to friends or family who compost or to a community compost location. L.A. County offers free webinars at smartgardening.com to teach residents how to practice backyard and worm composting on their own. Discounted compost bins are sold via the webinars. What about food that’s still edible? Where should it go? SB 1383 proposes increasing by 25% the amount of edible food that supermarkets and other large outlets preserve. (It does not require residents or small businesses to recycle edible food.) The surplus goes to food banks. Businesses can learn more about donations by visiting FoodDropLA.com. Once my local waste hauler gives the green light, will fruits and vegetables be the only appropriate food waste for the green bin? No. L.A. County says “all possible parts of food will be acceptable,” including cooked meat, bones, fish, soups and small amounts of grease. Properly licensed anaerobic digesters will be able to break it all down, while also killing pathogens. City sanitation officials agree that — once their curbside pickups begin — all food waste will be acceptable. In L.A., some residents have already been putting food scraps in their existing green bins intended for yard waste, even though the Bureau of Sanitation says that's a no-no and that the kitchen waste will be landfilled. Once the city rolls out its program, it's expected both food and yard waste will be permitted in the green bins. What if I run a restaurant and have a lot of grease? That should go to a cooking oil and grease recycler. L.A. County lists those here. Where should I store my kitchen waste and how do I make sure it doesn’t stink? Local governments and waste haulers recommend gathering the scraps in kitchen pails, which both L.A. city and county plan to distribute. Frequent emptying (and cleaning) of the pails should limit odors. Some users say lining them with paper towels also soaks up liquid that can raise a stink. The city of Los Angeles suggests two other odor-reducing techniques: layering food waste with yard trimmings or freezing food scraps in a reusable container prior to collection day. Can I be penalized if I dump my waste in the wrong place? Yes. Beginning in 2024, state law will allow fines for those who contaminate their organic waste. A first offense could cost you $50 to $100, with third and subsequent offenses costing up to $500. L.A. city sanitation officials said their “ambassadors” will notify those not in compliance and impose penalties only as a last resort. What happens to the kitchen scraps that go down the garbage disposal in my sink? Wastewater plants in L.A. County have the ability to harvest biogas from sewage sludge and food waste. The gas can be burned for electricity or turned into vehicle fuel. But the bureaucrats who handle your refuse don’t want too much waste in the drain because of limited sewer capacity. They say it’s more efficient to have the food waste composted or hauled away. The city of L.A. recommends putting only smaller fruit and vegetable scraps in the disposal. Where will all this extra food waste go? Most will go to large composting centers or to plants that will convert it into natural gas. Los Angeles County alone has projected that about 1.9 million tons of food waste a year will be diverted. It could take a dozen anaerobic digestion plants to process all of that, at a projected cost of $840 million. Who’s going to pay for all this? You are. A survey by the League of California Cities found that most local governments expect refuse collection rates to increase less than 20%, with 1 in 5 cities saying they expect charges to go up more. Costa Mesa, an early adopter of curbside green recycling, estimates that over nine years, monthly rates will have risen a total of $6.10, to $24.10 a month, by 2023-24.

12/27/2021,"A father and two sons died in a house fire Saturday, likely due to a dry Christmas tree or electrical issues. Two family dogs also died in the fire. The mother and eldest son survived with minor burn wounds. A GoFundMe has quickly surpassed its $20,000 goal, raising nearly $400,000 to support the family. A father and two sons in Pennsylvania died on Christmas Day after their house caught on fire. ""The area of origin was a Christmas tree, so we're not sure if it's because of electric or a dried up old Christmas tree,"" Fire Marshal Doug Wilhelm in Quakertown, Pennsylvania told CNN. The family had been sleeping when the fire broke out, Wilhelm said. Police and firefighters struggled to enter the home when they first arrived at the scene because the fire quickly spread and obstructed the entrance. ""It was too dangerous to get inside on the front side of the building with the fire,"" Wilhelm told CNN. ""The front door and front window were blocked, fire was advancing to the entire home at that point. It was very difficult for firefighters to make a safe entry. It took a while."" When they were finally able to find a way in, firefighters found three dead bodies. Eric King, 41, and his two school-aged sons died on the second floor, Wilhelm told CNN. Two family dogs also died, according to Wilhelm. The two sons, one a fifth-grader and the other a third-grader, attended Richland Elementary School in the Quakertown Community School District. ""It is with unbearable sorrow that we share with you this Christmas morning the tragic news that the King family, in a house fire early today, lost their father and two Richland Elementary School students,"" the Quakertown Community School District said in a Facebook post Saturday. The mother and the family's third and oldest child, Brady, survived with minor burn injuries. A GoFundMe started in the wake of the tragedy has surpassed its $20,000 goal, nearly reaching $400,000 as of Sunday morning. The entire home had been destroyed by the fire, the GoFundMe says. King and his wife, Kristin, were high school sweethearts, and all three boys were active in the community and at school. The parents ""were always smiling and full of positive spirits, you just couldn't help but to love them,"" the crowdfunding account says. ""The three boys, Eric and Kristin were all a huge part of the Quakertown Youth Baseball Association and spent their days and nights at the baseball fields.""

12/27/2021,"Airbus has only sold 15 of its A330-800neo aircraft, the next-generation variant of the popular A330-200. Uganda Airlines, Air Greenland, Kuwait Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia are the only four airlines to purchase the aircraft. One expert says that airlines don't want to pay for a smaller plane compared to the larger A330-900neo since the two have comparable per-seat costs. Airbus doesn't usually have a problem selling airplanes. As of October 2021, more than 20,000 orders have been placed for Airbus aircraft. The European aircraft manufacturers’ wide-body planes, specifically, can be found flying all over the world and are the backbone of numerous global airlines. Source: Airbus But one aircraft just hasn't resonated with customers, the A330-800neo. Only 15 aircraft have been sold as of October 2021 since the A330neo program launched in 2014 to counter the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Source: Airbus Airbus designed the aircraft to be a more efficient version of the A330-200 as part of an upgrade for the popular A330 family of aircraft. The A330-200, a commercial success, earned 662 orders over its life and 598 of the 647 aircraft that were delivered to customers are still flying. Source: Airbus Powering the A330neo family is the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 that Airbus says helps reduce fuel consumption and emissions by ""25% compared to its previous-generation aircraft."" Also aiding in its efficiency are new wings with composite winglets. Source: Airbus As a newer variant with more efficient engines, the A330-800neo had a good chance of riding on the success of its predecessor. But only four airlines have placed orders for the A330-800neo including Kuwait Airways, Uganda Airlines, Air Greenland, and Gaurda Indonesia, making the aircraft among Airbus' worst-selling aircraft in its history. Insider got a look at the A330-800neo at the Dubai Airshow 2021 when Airbus and Uganda Airlines teamed up to show off the jet. Here's what it's like onboard. The average Airbus A330-800neo can seat between 220 and 260 passengers in a three-class configuration, according to Airbus. Source: Airbus The total number of seats in Uganda Airlines' configuration is 258 seats across economy class, premium economy class, and business class cabins. In business class, a total of 20 seats are offered in a 1-2-1 configuration. Each seat offers direct aisle access and fully lie-flat capabilities that are ideal for long-haul flights. Seats along the edges of the cabin are the most private and ideal for solo travelers. Center-aisle seats are alternatively ideal for couples traveling together or travelers with companions. But for those seated in one of the paired ""honeymoon"" seats, as they're known, a partition helps maintain privacy. Other center-aisle seats are positioned along the aisle for a greater degree of privacy without the need for a partition. The staggered configuration of the business class cabin means that some of the seats along the sides of the cabin are closer to the window while others are on the aisle. True window seats offer additional privacy as they're situated away from the aisle, and also have the benefit of unobstructed window views. Airlines can increase the capacity of the business class cabin by expanding it past the second boarding door or install paired seats instead of individual seats. But the industry is moving away from paired seats as travelers want privacy and aisle access. And for airlines that want to maximize space with a three-cabin aircraft, keeping business class in between the first two boarding doors is typically the preferred option. Each seat offers standard business class seat amenities including a seat-back entertainment screen, personal reading lamp, adjustable headrest, and bounds of storage space. Behind business class, Uganda Airlines opted for a premium economy class consisting of 28 recliner seats. Seats are configured in a 2-3-2 configuration with greater amounts of pitch and width at each. Each seat features a seat-back entertainment screen as well as USB charging ports, water bottle holders, footrests, coat hooks, and a tethered entertainment remote. A solid tray table is also stored in the armrest, with a small drink counter in between seats. Premium economy is a hybrid product offering some of the glamour of a business class seat with a price just slightly above an economy class seat. The remaining 210 seats are the domain of economy class across two sections. Standard for the A330 family, seats are arranged in a 2-4-2 configuration. Seats along the cabin wall are ideal for couples and solo travelers as there are no middle seats. Travelers with a preference for window seats can also benefit from the side seats as there are fewer seats to climb over when trying to access the aisle. Center aisle seats are ideal for groups traveling together with as many as four travelers able to share a row. Economy class seats feature standard amenities such as a seat-back entertainment system, USB charging port, and adjustable headrest. In another standard for the A330 family, the curvature of the fuselage reduces the last few rows to three seats in the center aisle section. All A330neo aircraft come standard with the ""Airspace by Airbus"" cabin that includes mood lighting illuminating the cabin and greater overhead bin space for carry-on baggage. As far as where the aircraft will fly, there are not many places the A330-800neo can't go with a top range of 8,150 nautical miles. Uganda Airlines can fly all the way to the US West Coast and the east coast of Australia from Entebbe, Uganda. Source: Airbus Dubai is the furthest destination the aircraft flies to from Entebbe. And one limiting factor in the aircraft's range, though, is the lack of a crew rest area in Uganda Airlines' configuration. Rather than a dedicated space for flight attendants, seats in both the economy class and business class cabins have been dedicated for crew rest. Crew rest seats can be identified in both cabins by a curtain surrounding the seat. But such a capable aircraft begs the question: why aren't more airlines adding the A330-800neo to their fleets? ""It's a fairly simple story: the Dash 200 was always at a bit of a disadvantage because it's a shrink [of the A330-300,]"" Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, told Insider. And the same applies to the A330-800neo. ""All shrinks are a bit heavier on a per-seat basis because they're carrying around the same structures and systems and engines as the bigger planes but with fewer seats,"" Aboulafia said. Airlines might not want to pay similar operating costs for a plane with fewer seats, even if it means spending less to acquire the smaller model. The A330-900neo offers around 30 additional seats in a three-class configuration, in a cabin around 17 feet longer than the A330-800neo. That 17 feet can house a lot more business class seats to earn the airline additional premium revenue. The A330-800neo also has no shortage of competition, whether it be from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner or even smaller aircraft in the Airbus lineup. Narrow-body aircraft, including the A321neoLR, offer range capabilities that allow them to fly upwards of nine hours. Uganda Airlines' Airbus A330-800neo flight from Entebbe, Uganda to Dubai could very easily be operated by a smaller Airbus A321neoLR with only a slightly smaller passenger load. And the airlines that want the extended range capabilities of the A330neo compared to a narrow-body are finding it more cost advantageous to buy up the A330-900neo. Azul Brazilian Airlines, for example, chose the A330-900neo over the A330-800neo despite only having the A330-200 in its wide-body fleet prior to the purchase. Delta Air Lines and TAP Air Portugal, two other A330-200 operators, have also opted to only purchase the A330-900neo. Airbus still has time to sell the A330-800neo before writing the program off completely, according to Aboulafia. The A330-900neo has a sizeable backlog that will keep production on the aircraft family open for years to come. No further orders were announced for the A330-800neo were announced at the Dubai Airshow while Air Lease Corporation did place an order for four A330neos at the show. But potential airline customers did get to take a look at the aircraft and it's possible some will reexamine the A330-800neo now after seeing it up close.

12/27/2021,"FRANKFURT/PRAGUE, Dec 26 (Reuters) - The Yamal-Europe pipeline that usually delivers Russian gas to Western Europe was sending the fuel back to Poland for a sixth straight day on Sunday, according to data from German network operator Gascade. Data showed that flows at the Mallnow metering point on the German-Polish border were going east into Poland at an hourly volume of nearly 1.2 million kilowatt hours (kWh/h) on Sunday and were expected to stay at these levels during the day. Gascade is owned by WIGA, a joint venture of Gazprom and oil and gas company Wintershall DEA. Wintershall DEA is co-owned by German chemicals group BASF and Russia's LetterOne. Russia this week said the flow reversal was not a political move, though it coincides with rising tensions between Moscow and the West over Ukraine and has pushed gas prices to record highs. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said that Germany was reselling Russian gas to Poland and Ukraine rather than relieving an overheated market, putting blame for the reversal, and rocketing prices, on German gas importers. Data from Slovak pipeline operator Eustream showed capacity nominations for Sunday's Russian gas flows from Ukraine to Slovakia via the Velke Kapusany border point were at 739,826 megawatt hours (MWh), slightly down from Saturday's 747,031 MWh and below levels in recent weeks.

12/27/2021,"The Texas attorney general’s office has put its weight behind a landowner’s case against the companies developing a controversial Dallas-Houston bullet train, arguing they can’t force people to sell parcels needed for the high-speed rail project. Weighing in on the matter at the invitation of the Texas Supreme Court, the attorney general’s office offered the latest twist in the nearly decade-long fight over a 240-mile line that would connect Dallas and Houston. While the project has picked up support from leaders of urban areas, it’s encountered hard resistance from residents of the rural counties on its proposed path. One of those residents, Leon County landowner James Miles, sued Texas Central after the private company sought permission to survey his 600-acre property in 2015 as part of its efforts to examine the land for the project. Miles asked the courts to declare that the company did not have the right to enter his property because it does not have the eminent domain authority granted to railroad companies. He won at a trial court, but the legal dispute reached the Texas Supreme Court after a state appellate court in Corpus Christi sided with Texas Central and a related company. In a legal brief filed with the Texas Supreme Court on Friday, deputies for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued the high court should reverse that appellate decision and rule in Miles’ favor because the companies fall short of the Texas Constitution’s definition of a rail company. “The [companies] may only make preliminary examinations and surveys of private landowners’ properties for the purpose of constructing and operating a bullet train if they are either railroad companies or interurban electric railway companies,” the state wrote in its brief. “In the State’s view, the [companies] are neither.” That leaves them with “no authority to enter, examine, survey or condemn Miles’ land,” the state wrote. The state’s legal brief turns largely on the meaning of a portion of the state Transportation Code that gives private entities the ability to exercise eminent domain if they are “operating a railroad.” Reading at times as a semantic study in how to interpret tenses and grammar in state statute, the state said the companies could not be classified in that way because they “currently own no trains and have constructed no tracks or train depots.” “The rules of grammar confirm that the Respondents are not railroad companies,” the AG’s office argued. In the litigation, the companies have contended they meet that definition under the Transportation Code because they have performed the preliminary activities needed to construct a railroad, creating a reasonable probability that they would operate a railroad in the future. The state also disagreed with the companies on this point, saying they could not show a likelihood of procuring sufficient financing to complete the project. Texas Central representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously promised to fund the project — at a cost around $20 billion — with the support of private investors and without public funds. Company executives have previously said they would prefer not to use eminent domain “at all” and would rather work out amicable sales agreements for the thousands of parcels needed to construct the project across 10 counties. The company has also vowed to minimize how much the line will impact the land around it. The high-speed rail project has been mired by setbacks and controversy for the better part of a decade. In both courthouses and at the Capitol, opponents have zeroed in on Texas Central’s claim that state law gives it the right to use eminent domain and force unwilling owners to sell their land. The push for the Dallas-Houston bullet train has been built on its promise of establishing a line on which trains could run at speeds of up to 205 mph to cut a trip that would normally take four hours by car down to 90 minutes. But securing the land along its proposed route has proven a challenge. In 2020, Texas Central said it had secured more than 600 parcels covering just about 40% of the lots — not the land — it needs for the project. Given fierce opposition to the project in rural areas, eminent domain is seen as likely to become a necessity at some point. In Leon County, one proposal would bisect Miles’ 600 acres with a 100-foot right-of-way, according to the legal filings. On Monday, opponents of the rail described the attorney general’s brief as a “strong show of support for Texas private property rights.” “The brief filed by the [attorney general’s office] is clear that the past activities, corporate structure and financial state of the project coupled with the very high level of uncertainty that the project would ever even be built does not meet a threshold that would support Texas Central’s claim that it has eminent domain authority,” the group Texans Against High-Speed Rail said in a press release.

12/27/2021,"OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — In her dreams, Eveline Zagre believes her two sets of twins share premonitions and make demands of her -- buy a chicken, beg for money. “Their spirits will enter your dreams and let you know what they want and then you have to get it for them,” she said. Despite the burden of following their dream directives, Zagre considers herself doubly blessed. The 30-year-old mother of five is raising 3-year-old twin girls and 13-year-old twin boys in Burkina Faso – one of the West African countries where twins are revered for having special powers, like healing the sick, warding off danger, bringing financial prosperity and predicting the future. The majority-Muslim country, with its strong cultural embrace of the supernatural, regards twins as the children of spirits, and the mothers of twins as specially picked to bear them. This deeply rooted perception stems from the days people could not scientifically explain how twins were conceived. In other parts of West Africa, twins are seen as a curse. “People were afraid of twins because they couldn’t explain ... why these children were born two instead of one,” said Honorine Sawadogo, a sociologist at the government-run National Center for Scientific and Technological Research in Burkina Faso. Parents of twins would turn to witch doctors who came up with rules they believed they must follow in order to keep their children and themselves safe, said Sawadogo, who did her doctoral research on the mothers of twins. These beliefs and practices persist today despite the established scientific explanation for how twins come into the world. Zagre and her husband, Ousmane Nikiema, visited a witch doctor after giving birth to both sets of twins. For their boys, the parents were given no directives. But a witch doctor told them their girls, Victorine and Victoria Nikiema, needed to beg for money on the side of the road or risk being killed by a family member’s spirit. ""If (the witch doctor) sees a spirit in the compound, you’ll have to take the children to beg in order to prevent the curse,"" said Nikiema, who lives with his family in Burkina Faso's capital city, Ouagadougou. “(The spirit) might not kill them, but he’ll do something to them. He can make them insane or something similar, or he can paralyze them.” Throughout Ouagadougou, mothers and their identically dressed twins can be seen sitting on mats alongside roads and begging. They are driven by dream requests and witch doctor instructions, mothers told The Associated Press. As they beg, visitors offer gifts, like chickens, honey cake and seashells, in exchange for blessings. “I bless people when they come and give us things, I say may God heal you if someone comes and is sick,” said Marcelline Tapsoba, the mother of 2-year-old twins. As they sat on the ground in their usual spot in the city's outskirts, Tapsoba and her children were surrounded by other mothers and their twins who also were begging and offering blessings. Tapsoba said those who receive her blessings often return weeks later to thank her for their newfound romantic or financial success. Similar scenes play out in Ghana. “If you give birth to the twins in Ghana, you have to follow the twins’ rules,” said Kasim Amadu, a businessman. It is thought that wronged and unhappy twins can lead to personal harm for the parents and others, he said. Most cultures in West Africa cherish twins, and soothsayers believe they can enhance their communication with the spirit world through them, said Philip Peek, a professor emeritus at Drew University in New Jersey whose research includes folklore and African religion. Peek, who is the editor of the book, “Twins in African and Diaspora Cultures: Double Trouble, Twice Blessed,” said there is a longstanding global belief that twins have a heightened ability to communicate because of the bond they form in the womb, which allows them to connect to higher powers. “They communicate intuitively and the ability is certainly recognized in secular terms, not just spiritual,” Peek said. Not every West African community embraces them. Twins are considered evil in some neighborhoods surrounding Nigeria’s capital of Abuja, said Stevens Olusola Ajayi, a Christian missionary who has rescued 19 sets of twins out of fear they would be killed. Ajayi, who has been doing this work since 1996, brings the children to live with his family and community. This year he returned six children to their parents; it is the first time he has been able to arrange such family reunions. Even in countries where they are viewed favorably, twins can be at risk of being exploited for financial gain. Some mothers borrow children from neighbors and pass them off as twins to make more money from begging, said Sawadogo, the sociologist. It is not easy being the parent of twins. In Ouagadougou, Fati Yougma, 27, said her twin girls beat her in her dreams if she doesn’t obey their demands. Despite that, Yougma is honored to be their mother. ___ AP journalist Chinedu Asadu in Lagos, Nigeria, contributed to this report. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through The Conversation U.S. The AP is solely responsible for this content.",World/Associated Press,Twins a mixed blessing for some West African parents,https://news.yahoo.com/twins-mixed-blessing-west-african-142843381.html
