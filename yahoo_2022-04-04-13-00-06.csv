4/4/2022,"When mom-of-three Patricia Feldman decided on helping fund her son's engineering degree at Purdue University, she didn’t expect him to graduate owing nearly $100,000 to a loan servicer in addition to several federal student loans. “It sounds worse than a payday loan,” Feldman told Yahoo Finance. ""It sounds almost illegal."" Income-share agreements, known as ISAs, are an alternative type of student loan financing where a borrower receives a loan, then pays a percentage of their income after graduation. The terms of an ISA depends on various factors, such as their major topic of study and projected future earnings. Purdue’s Back a Boiler program, launched in 2016, offers ISAs to students seeking alternatives to traditional federal and private student loans. Feldman's son took out a $10,373 ISA for the 2018-19 academic year, and a $29,491 ISA for the 2019-2020 year, according to documentation seen by Yahoo Finance. That $39,864 loan ballooned to $99,660.50 as of January 2022. ""This is more than double the original lend,"" Feldman stated in a January 18 letter that was addressed to Purdue President Mitch Daniels, and seen by Yahoo Finance. ""In what world is this equitable for my son?"" Since the ISA stated that the borrower would not have to pay if they did not find a job, or earned income that did not exceed $40,000, Feldman added: ""Should I encourage him to stay home, run out the clock on the agreement (104 months) and owe nothing? He wouldn’t do that because he is a fine young man, with a great education and a good job. All due to Purdue."" When asked about Feldman's case, a Purdue spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that ""Purdue takes seriously its commitment to make sure Back a Boiler participants are fully aware of their repayment obligations in advance of entering into any agreement. Our website, as well as our contracts, clearly spell out those terms. And each Back a Boiler participant must successfully complete a quiz prior to entering into an ISA to ensure their awareness of those obligations."" ISA companies previously claimed their product is neither a ""loan"" nor a ""credit,"" but instead a ""contingent debt"" since a student doesn't have to pay the ISA until they find a job. The federal government recently categorized ISAs as ""private education loans."" Feldman initially thought the ISAs were a great alternative to traditional loans since they were tied to a borrower’s income and marketed as a fresh new way to pay for college. She now thinks what she helped her son sign up for was far worse than a federally-backed student loan. ""I write to you with a sickening stomach because I arranged and encouraged this loan,"" her letter to Daniels stated. ""I made a terrible mistake, but in continuing to market and entice unsuspecting students and parents, you are to blame. I will be fighting this for a very long time as my son attempts to pay back an alarming amount of money."" Feldman said after her son made two $900 monthly payments on his nearly $100,000 in debt, she tried to pay the entire sum off on behalf of her son — but the terms of the ISA didn’t allow for a lump sum payment. So now her son has $900 monthly payments while juggling his first job out of college. “It's been just this horrendous deal that I've gotten him into,” Feldman said. Feldman and her son’s negative experience is becoming more commonplace, according to student loan advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center (SPBC), which is working with Feldman and pushing for increased federal oversight of ISAs. Aside from categorizing ISAs as private student loan debt, the federal government reminds higher education institutions ""of their obligations when recommending, promoting, or endorsing private education loans.” In August 2021, California became the first state to move toward regulating ISAs. ""Colleges that market private student loans must follow the Department’s rules regarding preferred lender arrangements and private student loans, including disclosing key terms and establishing a code of conduct,"" an Education Department (ED) spokesperson told Yahoo Finance. ""These rules relate to loans not offered by the federal government, including ISAs that meet the definition of a private education loan."" On Thursday, SBPC sent a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona requesting the federal agency to investigate how Purdue is structuring and marketing its ISAs. “We write today to highlight troubling ongoing practices by a Title IV school that appear to violate provisions of the Higher Education Act ('HEA') and otherwise to jeopardize the school’s Program Participation Agreement ('PPA') with the Department,” the advocacy group wrote, adding that Purdue seemed to be masking its relationship with private student lenders through its Back a Boiler program. Purdue, which is governed by the Higher Education Act since it draws on federal funding as a Title IV school, “is generally prohibited from co-branding private loan products with student lenders and is bound by substantial restrictions and disclosure obligations around so-called 'preferred lender arrangements' ('PLAs') between colleges and creditors,” the SBPC letter stated. “All available evidence indicates that Purdue has brazenly ignored these limits and responsibilities as part of a scheme to drive its students to take on risky, high-rate private student loans,” the letter added. ""Purdue’s ongoing lawlessness in the face of these clearly articulated expectations requires the Department to put this statement into action."" Some students who have taken out ISAs at other educational institutions have ended up suing the same lender that Purdue works with, Vemo Education, Yahoo Finance previously reported. Advocates have previously sounded the alarm over the growing number of ISA providers that presented themselves as an alternative to traditional student loans, arguing that many of the products offered skirt consumer protection laws and engage in deceptive practices. ""Our findings are just the latest in a long line of serious concerns surrounding the back-room deal Mitch Daniels cut with the student loan industry and his friends on Wall Street to push high-cost loans onto Purdue students,"" Ben Kaufman, who heads research and investigations at the SBPC, told Yahoo Finance. ""It boggles the mind why Mitch Daniels is so resistant to just following the law, but it's clear that the Department of Education must step in. Too many students have already been harmed by Mitch's predatory pet project in private student lending."" The ED spokesperson added that over the next year, the agency ""plans to work with other federal partners to provide additional information to colleges on how to further improve the accuracy and consistency of requirements related to preferred lender arrangements"" in an effort to provide more transparency to parents and students who may have been approached by schools offering ISAs. Thanks to the student loan payment pause, which is currently set to end after May 1, Feldman said she wasn’t yet making monthly payments for her son’s federally-backed student loans. “I'm fully prepared to do that,"" Feldman said. ""That's part of what I have to do. I don't like it. But that's what we're gonna do.” Student loan payments and interest accrual on federally-held debt have been suspended since March 2020, meaning that nearly 37 million borrowers have not had to make loan payments during that time and their amount due has not increased. There is also a debate over cancellation: President Joe Biden backed the forgiveness of $10,000 in student loan debt on the campaign trail in 2020. During his administration, prominent Democrats have repeatedly urged a seemingly skeptical President Biden to enact broad-based cancellation of up to $50,000 via executive action (as opposed to legislation passed by Congress). The impatience over a decision by the White House reached a point where even a major student loan refinancing company has joined the chorus of voices calling for student loan forgiveness. (ISAs would not be part of the cancellation.) In any case, Feldman and her husband have been working to obtain more information about ISAs and publicize the issue. Feldman also said she began sending weekly emails to Purdue’s Daniels. “I emailed him every Monday for months,"" she said. ""And it was the same letter, just repetitive."" She added a lawyer from Daniels’ office reached out to her in late February to understand her situation, but the correspondence has been quiet recently. “For me, Mitch Daniels will never have another restful night,” Feldman said. “If I don't hear [from him], I will email every day, I will flood his email. And I don't know what it will do. But it's something I can do.” — Aarthi is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. She can be reached at aarthi@yahoofinance.com. Follow her on Twitter @aarthiswami.

4/4/2022,"One hundred and fifty-five years ago, on March 30, 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward and Russian envoy Baron Edouard de Stoeckl signed the Treaty of Cession. With a stroke of a pen, Tsar Alexander II had ceded Alaska, his country’s last remaining foothold in North America, to the United States for US.2 million. That sum, amounting to just 8 million in today’s dollars, brought to an end Russia’s 125-year odyssey in Alaska and its expansion across the treacherous Bering Sea, which at one point extended the Russian Empire as far south as Fort Ross, California, 90 miles from San Francisco Bay. Today Alaska is one of the richest U.S. states thanks to its abundance of natural resources, such as petroleum, gold and fish, as well as its vast expanse of pristine wilderness and strategic location as a window on Russia and gateway to the Arctic. So what prompted Russia to withdraw from its American beachhead? And how did it come to possess it in the first place? As a descendant of Inupiaq Eskimos, I have been living and studying this history all my life. In a way, there are two histories of how Alaska came to be American – and two perspectives. One concerns how the Russians took “possession” of Alaska and eventually ceded it to the U.S. The other is from the perspective of my people, who have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, and for whom the anniversary of the cession brings mixed emotions, including immense loss but also optimism. The lust for new lands that brought Russia to Alaska and eventually California began in the 16th century, when the country was a fraction of its current size. That began to change in 1581, when Russia overran a Siberian territory known as the Khanate of Sibir, which was controlled by a grandson of Genghis Khan. This key victory opened up Siberia, and within 60 years the Russians were at the Pacific. The Russian advance across Siberia was fueled in part by the lucrative fur trade, a desire to expand the Russian Orthodox Christian faith to the “heathen” populations in the east and the addition of new taxpayers and resources to the empire. In the early 18th century, Peter the Great – who created Russia’s first Navy – wanted to know how far the Asian landmass extended to the east. The Siberian city of Okhotsk became the staging point for two explorations he ordered. And in 1741, Vitus Bering successfully crossed the strait that bears his name and sighted Mt. Saint Elias, near what is now the village of Yakutat, Alaska. Although Bering’s second Kamchatka Expedition brought disaster for him personally when adverse weather on the return journey led to a shipwreck on one of the westernmost Aleutian Islands and his eventual death from scurvy in December 1741, it was an incredible success for Russia. The surviving crew fixed the ship, stocked it full of hundreds of the sea otters, foxes and fur seals that were abundant there and returned to Siberia, impressing Russian fur hunters with their valuable cargo. This prompted something akin to the Klondike gold rush 150 years later. But maintaining these settlements wasn’t easy. Russians in Alaska – who numbered no more than 800 at their peak – faced the reality of being half a globe away from St. Petersburg, then the capital of the empire, making communications a key problem. Also, Alaska was too far north to allow for significant agriculture and therefore unfavorable as a place to send large numbers of settlers. So they began exploring lands farther south, at first looking only for people to trade with so they could import the foods that wouldn’t grow in Alaska’s harsh climate. They sent ships to what is now California, established trade relations with the Spaniards there and eventually set up their own settlement at Fort Ross in 1812. Thirty years later, however, the entity set up to handle Russia’s American explorations failed and sold what remained. Not long after, the Russians began to seriously question whether they could continue their Alaskan colony as well. For starters, the colony was no longer profitable after the sea otter population was decimated. Then there was the fact that Alaska was difficult to defend and Russia was short on cash due to the costs of the war in Crimea. So clearly the Russians were ready to sell, but what motivated the Americans to want to buy? In the 1840s, the United States had expanded its interests to Oregon, annexed Texas, fought a war with Mexico and acquired California. Afterward, Secretary of State Seward wrote in March 1848: “Our population is destined to roll resistless waves to the ice barriers of the north, and to encounter oriental civilization on the shores of the Pacific.” Almost 20 years after expressing his thoughts about expansion into the Arctic, Seward accomplished his goal. In Alaska, the Americans foresaw a potential for gold, fur and fisheries, as well as more trade with China and Japan. The Americans worried that England might try to establish a presence in the territory, and the acquisition of Alaska – it was believed – would help the U.S. become a Pacific power. And overall the government was in an expansionist mode backed by the then-popular idea of “manifest destiny.” So a deal with incalculable geopolitical consequences was struck, and the Americans seemed to get quite a bargain for their .2 million. Just in terms of wealth, the U.S. gained about 370 million acres of mostly pristine wilderness – almost a third the size of the European Union – including 220 million acres of what are now federal parks and wildlife refuges. Hundreds of billions of dollars in whale oil, fur, copper, gold, timber, fish, platinum, zinc, lead and petroleum have been produced in Alaska over the years – allowing the state to do without a sales or income tax and give every resident an annual stipend. Alaska still likely has billions of barrels of oil reserves. The state is also a key part of the United States defense system, with military bases located in Anchorage and Fairbanks, and it is the country’s only connection to the Arctic, which ensures it has a seat at the table as melting glaciers allow the exploration of the region’s significant resources. But there’s an alternate version of this history. When Bering finally located Alaska in 1741, Alaska was home to about 100,000 people, including Inuit, Athabascan, Yupik, Unangan and Tlingit. There were 17,000 alone on the Aleutian Islands. Despite the relatively small number of Russians who at any one time lived at one of their settlements – mostly on the Aleutians Islands, Kodiak, Kenai Peninsula and Sitka – they ruled over the native populations in their areas with an iron hand, taking children of the leaders as hostages, destroying kayaks and other hunting equipment to control the men and showing extreme force when necessary. The Russians brought with them weaponry such as firearms, swords, cannons and gunpowder, which helped them secure a foothold in Alaska along the southern coast. They used firepower, spies and secured forts to maintain security, and selected Christianized local leaders to carry out their wishes. However, they also met resistance, such as from the Tlingits, who were capable warriors, ensuring their hold on territory was tenuous. By the time of the cession, only 50,000 indigenous people were estimated to be left, as well as 483 Russians and 1,421 Creoles (descendants of Russian men and indigenous women). On the Aleutian Islands alone, the Russians enslaved or killed thousands of Aleuts. Their population plummeted to 1,500 in the first 50 years of Russian occupation due to a combination of warfare, disease and enslavement. When the Americans took over, the United States was still engaged in its Indian Wars, so they looked at Alaska and its indigenous inhabitants as potential adversaries. Alaska was made a military district by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant with Gen. Jefferson C. Davis selected as the new commander. For their part, Alaska Natives claimed that they still had title to the territory as its original inhabitants and having not lost the land in war or ceded it to any country – including the U.S., which technically didn’t buy it from the Russians but bought the right to negotiate with the indigenous populations. Still, Natives were denied U.S. citizenship until 1924, when the Indian Citizenship Act was passed. During that time, Alaska Natives had no rights as citizens and could not vote, own property or file for mining claims. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, in conjunction with missionary societies, in the 1860s began a campaign to eradicate indigenous languages, religion, art, music, dance, ceremonies and lifestyles. It was only in 1936 that the Indian Reorganization Act authorized tribal governments to form, and only nine years later overt discrimination was outlawed by Alaska’s Anti-Discrimination Act of 1945. The law banned signs such as “No Natives Need Apply” and “No Dogs or Natives Allowed,” which were common at the time. Eventually, however, the situation improved markedly for Natives. Alaska finally became a state in 1959, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the Alaska Statehood Act, allotting it 104 million acres of the territory. And in an unprecedented nod to the rights of Alaska’s indigenous populations, the act contained a clause emphasizing that citizens of the new state were declining any right to land subject to Native title – which by itself was a very thorny topic because they claimed the entire territory. A result of this clause was that in 1971 President Richard Nixon ceded 44 million acres of federal land, along with How deep is the ocean? https://theconversation.com/how-deep-is-the-ocean-121168 Sun, 03 Apr 2022 17:33:46 +0000 tag:theconversation.com,2011:article/121168 In some places, the ocean is almost 7 miles deep. Scientists exploring the ocean floor have found strange sea creatures, bizarre geologic formations and records of Earth's history. Suzanne OConnell, Harold T. Stearns Professor of Earth Science, Wesleyan University Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com. How deep is the ocean? Explorers started making navigation charts showing how wide the ocean was more than 500 years ago. But it’s much harder to calculate how deep it is. If you wanted to measure the depth of a pool or lake, you could tie a weight to a string, lower it to the bottom, then pull it up and measure the wet part of the string. In the ocean you would need a rope thousands of feet long. In 1872 the HMS Challenger, a British Navy ship, set sail to learn about the ocean, including its depth. It carried 181 miles (291 kilometers) of rope. During their four-year voyage, the Challenger crew collected samples of rocks, mud and animals from many different areas of the ocean. They also found one of the deepest zones, in the western Pacific, the Mariana Trench which stretches for 1,580 miles (2,540 kilometers). Today scientists know that on average the ocean is 2.3 miles (3.7 kilometers) deep, but many parts are much shallower or deeper. To measure depth they use sonar, which stands for Sound Navigation And Ranging. A ship sends out pulses of sound energy and measures depth based on how quickly the sound travels back. The deepest parts of the ocean are trenches – long, narrow depressions, like a trench in the ground, but much bigger. The HMS Challenger sampled one of these zones at the southern end of the Mariana Trench, which might be the deepest point in the ocean. Known as the Challenger Deep, it is 35,768 to 36,037 feet deep – almost 7 miles (11 kilometers). Ocean scientists like me study the sea floor because it helps us understand how Earth functions. For example, our planet’s outer layer is made of tectonic plates – huge moving slabs of rock and sediment. The Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount chain, a line of peaks on the ocean floor, was created when a tectonic plate moved over a spot where hot rock welled up from deep inside the Earth. When two tectonic plates move away from each other underwater, new material rises up into Earth’s crust. This process, which creates new ocean floor, is called seafloor spreading. Sometimes super-hot fluids from inside the Earth shoot up through cracks in the ocean floor called hydrothermal vents. Amazing fish, shellfish, tube worms and other life forms live in these zones. Between the creation and destruction of ocean plates, sediments collect on the sea floor and provide an archive of Earth’s history, the evolution of climate and life that is available nowhere else.

4/4/2022,"After spreading across Asia and Europe, the BA.2 subvariant of the novel coronavirus is now dominant in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Right now, U.S. COVID cases are at a six-month low. But what happens next in the U.S. and nearby countries is hard to predict. Looking to Europe for hints isn’t enormously helpful because, on that continent, BA.2 has behaved … unpredictably. Indeed, unpredictability might be exactly what Americans—and everyone else—should expect as the pandemic enters its 28th month. A patchwork of public-health rules, varying vaccination rates and differing amounts of natural immunity from past infections mean that no two countries are the same. But even those differences don’t fully explain BA.2’s uneven impact. The COVID Variant That Could Define Your Summer “The bottom line is that it is not predictable what BA.2 will do,” John Swartzberg, a professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California-Berkeley’s School of Public Health, told The Daily Beast. Amid this confusion, at least one thing remains true, however. As volatile as BA.2 is when it comes to countries and populations, you can still protect yourself by getting vaccinated. Usually, there’s a pattern with new COVID lineages. An uptick in positive tests from clinics, hospitals and wastewater samples correlates with a proportional increase in symptomatic infections. But when it comes to BA.2, “something different seems to be occurring,” Peter Hotez, an expert in vaccine development at Baylor College, told The Daily Beast. “BA.2 is going up everywhere in terms of percentage of virus isolated” in tests, Hotez explained, “yet this translates into many different scenarios in terms of rise in cases.” BA.2 is a highly mutated cousin of the previously-dominant BA.1 subvariant of Omicron, the latest major variant—“lineage” is the scientific term–of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Changes to the spike protein, which helps the virus to grab onto and infect our cells, make BA.1 and BA.2 extremely transmissible. BA.1, which first appeared last fall and quickly drove record infections across much of the world, was the most contagious respiratory virus many virologists had ever seen—until BA.2 showed up a few weeks after its older cousin. BA.2 could be as much as 80 percent more transmissible than BA.1, Swartzberg said. A health worker takes a swab sample from a man to be tested for COVID-19 at a testing site along a street in Beijing on March 15, 2022. That’s why BA.2 eventually has outcompeted BA.1 and become the dominant sublineage in a steadily growing number of countries. It happened first in China, which for more than two years managed to avoid major COVID outbreaks through a combination of travel restrictions, business closures, careful contact-tracing and strict quarantine rules. BA.2 blew right through China’s so-called “zero-COVID” strategy, causing cases to spike in Hong Kong then neighboring Shenzen then Shanghai. Authorities locked down each city in turn but still failed to stop the sublineage’s march across the country. How COVID Crept Into This ‘Zero Policy’ Country Europe was next. Health officials in the Americas watched nervously as BA.2 became dominant in one European country after another. After all, Europe tends to catch a particular coronavirus lineage or sublineage a month or six weeks before the U.S. and its neighbors do. But BA.2 hasn’t sent clear signals. The first confusing datapoint actually wasn’t in Europe—it was in Africa. Weirdly, BA.2 was a virtual no-show in South Africa. That country logged a big surge in BA.1 cases in December, and then … nothing. A steady decline in cases even as BA.2 was ravaging other big, rich countries. Some European countries likewise have escaped significant harm from BA.2. Others are reeling. The United Kingdom and France caught BA.1 big-time in December and January. Both countries reported record numbers of cases that, owing to the vaccines, fortunately didn’t lead to record hospitalizations and deaths. Austria, by contrast, muddled through BA.1 before taking a huge hit from BA.2. The U.K. reported a weekly average of 183,000 new daily cases in early January. Three weeks later, France counted a staggering weekly average of 354,000 daily new cases. The U.K.’s worst day for BA.1 deaths was Feb. 2, when authorities reported 535 COVID fatalities. On France’s worst day of BA.1, Feb. 8, 691 people died of COVID. Comparing the two countries is natural. Not only are they neighbors, they also have roughly the same number of people–around 67 million. Both have managed to fully vaccinate around three-quarters of their populations. Both have wound down all major domestic COVID restrictions. It makes sense that BA.2 would affect France and the U.K. similarly. And there, at least, the sublineage made some sense. The BA.2 wave that rolled across the U.K. and France starting in February has been relatively minor compared to the BA.1 wave—in both countries. France’s daily new BA.2 cases seem to be leveling off at a weekly average of 126,000 infections. The U.K.’s weekly average of daily new cases peaked at 125,000 on March 21. Deaths tend to lag cases by a few weeks, so it’s not clear how fatal BA.2 will be in either country, but so far the worst daily death toll is much lower than it was for BA.1. Now consider Austria. With just 8.9 million people, it’s smaller than the U.K. and France. But it’s equally well-vaccinated—and even came close to having a nationwide vaccine-mandate before canceling the planned mandate back in early March, days before it was due to take effect. Austria, like most countries in Europe, has ended domestic restrictions on businesses and travel. But unlike the U.K. and France, Austria caught BA.2 worse than BA.1. Daily new case rates from BA.1 swelled to a weekly average of 34,000 and stayed there for a month and a half. Then BA.2 arrived in early March and, without much respite from BA.1, added another 10,000 daily new cases on top of the existing weekly average. Aside from a tiny dip in mid-March, the daily death rate has been going up and up on a weekly basis since January in Austria. BA.2 is claiming 40 lives a day, day after day on average. It’s difficult to determine which policies make the difference—assuming differences in public-health strategy matter at all against a virus as contagious as BA.2. Yes, Austria almost had a vaccine mandate, but it didn’t actually take force. And it’s very hard to say what the proposed mandate’s impact was, or would have been. “Even if no additional people got vaccinated after a mandate was introduced, this doesn't mean it didn't ‘work,’ as the purpose of the mandate may have been to simply ensure that the only people you encounter when out at a restaurant or concert are vaccinated,” Maxwell Smith, a bioethicist at Western University in Ontario, told The Daily Beast. A screen shows the number of new COVID-19 infections nationwide at a subway station on March 17, 2022, in Seoul, South Korea. “In that case, the vaccination mandate ‘working’ would mean reducing levels of transmission of the virus in the settings to which it applied,” Smith added. “Or, in the case of preserving critical infrastructure, it would mean something like fewer cases of severe illness or hospitalizations among those to whom the mandate applied.” There are lots of ways Austria’s vaccine-mandate might have improved outcomes for millions of Austrians at risk of catching COVID. But that didn’t stop Austria as a whole from suffering worse from BA.2 than other nearby countries. “There are many factors that may have led to the case numbers we're seeing both in Austria and its neighboring countries, so I can't say with any certainty that this can be chalked up to their vaccine policies or vaccine politics alone,” Smith said. COVID Wave That Hits Children Hardest Is Headed to the U.S. Experts are at a loss to explain what other factors might be at work. If nearby countries have vaccinated roughly the same percentage of their populations and have also reopened their borders, businesses and schools—thus allowing for a certain level of natural immunity from past infection—then they should be equally prepared for a new viral lineage. Clearly, they’re not. “I don’t see a consistent thread between countries,” Swartzberg said. There are serious implications for the rest of the world as it braces for BA.2. Even strong vaccine uptake and lingering natural immunity might not spare you a big bump in infections. By the same token, BA.2 might just bypass a country for reasons no one fully understands, like it did with South Africa. But the experiences of whole countries aren’t the experiences of individuals. Yes, BA.2 might have unpredictable effects on populations. But the science is clear on how people can reduce their personal risk. Favor well-ventilated indoor spaces. Wear an N95 mask when local case rates are high. Most importantly, get vaccinated and boosted. Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/4/2022,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Top leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints addressed COVID-19, the church's support of non-discrimination laws, war in Ukraine and legacies of racism at the faith's first in-person conference since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The nearly 17 million-member faith, which is widely known as the Mormon church, is hosting about 13,000 people at its 21,000-seat Salt Lake City conference center over two sessions on Saturday. Though its signature conference regularly reached full capacity pre-pandemic, for two years, it has been held mostly remotely, with the majority of viewers watching livestreams from afar. President Russell Nelson, the Latter-day Saints' 97-year-old prophet, on Saturday told listeners gathered at the church's Utah headquarters and those tuning in remotely that the troubles afflicting the world reaffirmed the need for faith and devotion. “Contention violates everything the Savior stood for and taught,” he said. He and other leaders mostly eschewed political issues, focused their remarks on spiritual matters and stressed unity and faith amid worldwide struggles. However, when high-ranking officials addressed current events and politics, they centered their remarks on denouncing polarization. They urged members of the faith to put their energy toward solution-oriented work rather than heated debates or criticism focused on the past. The forward-looking perspective echoes prior remarks from church leaders, who have disavowed racism and expressed regret for past church positions, while stopping short of formally apologizing and avoiding opening up debate about church doctrines being reversed. Church leader Neil L. Andersen implored members of the faith to focus on healing divisions, rather than dwelling on historical injustices or other divisive matters. Andersen encouraged tolerance and acceptance, highlighting the church's support for non-discrimination legislation in Arizona designed to protect LGBTQ individuals. ""We genuinely love and care for all our neighbors, whether or not they believe as we do,"" Andersen, a member of a top governing church panel called the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, said. The church has backed anti-discrimination laws in Arizona and Utah and over the past decade softened its stances toward LGBTQ members of the faith and their families. However, it remains opposed to same-sex marriage on theological grounds. Unlike prior conferences, most church leaders did not explicitly address the nationwide reckoning over racial injustice. Andersen encouraged listeners to summon “the inner strength to cool, calm, and quench the fiery darts aimed toward the truths we love.” As an example of such a dart, he referenced a Salt Lake Tribune  opinion piece that connected contemporary racism in Utah to historical examples of prejudice, including the church’s ban on Black members serving in the priesthood that was lifted nearly half a century ago. Andersen urged listeners to avoid “shrinking before those who disparage us"" and share the faith in ways “void of anger or malice.” Church officials announced a series of personnel changes Saturday, including the addition of Tracy Y. Browning to a leadership role. When she takes her post in August, she’ll become the first Black woman to serve on an all-women leadership panel focused on families and children. Women cannot serve in the priesthood or top leadership positions in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, though some have pushed to expand women's roles in leadership. “Demanding revelation from God is both arrogant and unproductive. Instead, we wait on the Lord and his timetable to reveal his truths through the means that he has established,” high-ranking church official Dale G. Renlund told a women's-only session Saturday evening. Jeffrey R. Holland, another high-ranking church official, geared remarks toward young people struggling amid the pandemic, shedding light on the risk of suicide and urging kids to seek help and counsel. His remarks come after the number of emergency department visits for suspected suicide attempts spiked during the first year of the pandemic and parallel concerns raised last month by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Latter-day Saint himself, about transgender youth and suicide. “Watch for signs of depression, despair, or anything hinting of self-harm. Offer your help. Listen. Make some kind of intervention as appropriate,” Holland told conference-goers. Though high-ranking officials generally focus on spirituality at the church’s signature twice-yearly conference, they have in the past announced major shifts including the lifting of a ban on baptisms for children of same-sex couples. While disagreement exists among members of the faith, throughout the pandemic, Nelson and other high-ranking church officials have repeatedly encouraged vaccinations and adherence to public health guidelines like masks. For a period of time, they closed temples, suspended in-person services and sent missionaries back home. Church leaders on Saturday commended missionaries for adapting to the challenges presented by COVID-19, which for many included pivoting to remote service, and acknowledged it had not been easy. They encouraged young men eligible to serve missions, but who may not have done so yet because of the pandemic, to prepare. “I know it has not been easy,” said high-ranking church official M. Russell Ballard. __ This story has been corrected to show that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints plans to host about 13,000 members of the faith at its twice-yearly conference over two sessions on Saturday, not 10,000 people.",U.S./Associated Press,Mormons lower temperature on hot-button issues at conference,https://news.yahoo.com/mormons-convene-person-signature-conference-160422262.html
4/4/2022,"(Reuters) - Two blasts were heard in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine on Sunday, two witnesses told Reuters, days after Russian authorities accused Ukrainian forces of striking a fuel depot there. The cause of the blasts was not immediately clear. One witness said the blasts were so powerful that they rattled the windows of her home in Belgorod. The blasts come days after Russia's defence ministry said two Ukrainian helicopters struck a fuel depot in the city, some 35 km (22 miles) from the border with Ukraine, after entering Russia at extremely low altitude in the early hours of Friday. The Kremlin said the incident could undermine peace efforts, while a top Ukrainian security official denied responsibility. A local official from the region around Belgorod said there had been a blast in the village of Tomarovka on Sunday but that no one had been hurt and no property damaged. ""There was a bang, debris fell onto the ground,"" Oleg Medvedev, head of the Yakovlevsky city district outside Belgorod, wrote on the Telegram messenger application. He did not elaborate on the nature of the debris nor on the cause of the blast. It was unclear if the blast described by Medvedev was one of the blasts heard by the witnesses.

4/4/2022,"Natives probably know the primary thing to do when they see those pretty blue and purple bubbles that look like partially deflated balloons on the beach. Don’t pick them up! Spring on South Florida beaches is not just for spring breakers and swimmers. Spring is also often about the return of Portuguese man o’ war. These sea creatures are best viewed from afar because they have tentacles — and even when the creatures lie immobile on the beach, they’ve enough juice to sting. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Ocean Rescue has sent a warning about “this unwelcomed visitor” as strong winds and currents brought man-o-war to South Florida beaches. Beachgoers have noticed the man o’ war in Miami-Dade and Broward, including the Crandon Beach, South Beach and Hollywood shorelines. The Portuguese man o’ war is often called a jellyfish, but is actually a species of siphonophore, a group of animals that are closely related to jellyfish, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Why the name? The Portugues man o’ war resembles 18th-century Portuguese warships under full sail, according to NOAA. They are propelled by the wind and sea currents. The man o’ war, which likes warmer waters in the tropics, has a balloon-like float and its colors can vary. The float can be blue, violet or pink and looms up to six inches above the waterline or shoreline once washed up on the beach. Under the floating bubble — a gas-filled bladder — you’ll find long strands of tentacles and polyps that can grow to an average of 30 feet and may extend by as much as 100 feet, NOAA says. Those tentacles are what you especially don’t want to come into contact with because they contain stinging nematocysts — “microscopic capsules loaded with coiled, barbed tubes that deliver venom capable of paralyzing and killing small fish and crustaceans,” NOAA says. Our body mass is larger than that of a small fish so the man o’ war sting is rarely deadly to people. That said, the sting, which will cause red welts and sometimes fever and nausea, can cause an allergic reaction in some people and in rare cases, heart failure, MDFR Ocean Rescue warns. Even when the man o’ war washes up on the sand and bakes on the beach for weeks, those long blue tentacles contain venom. Here are some tips from American Oceans: ▪ Get the tentacles off your skin. But be careful how you do that. Don’t pluck them off with your bare hands lest you get stung there, too. Instead, wash them off with salt water and not fresh water because fresh could cause the sting to become more intense, according to oceanic experts. You can also use an object, like a stick or utensil, to get the tentacles off and away from you. ▪ Ice the stung area. This will reduce swelling and pain, which generally should subside after 30 minutes or so. ▪ Get medical attention if you are feeling lightheaded, dizzy or having trouble breathing. ▪ Listen to the lifeguards. If they tell you to get out of the water, do so. If you see flags posted on the shore warning of man o’ war, keep alert. Let a lifeguard know if you see them around. Sometimes they look like a blue plastic bag floating on a wave or discarded on the sand. They aren’t goodie bags left behind by a spring breaker.",U.S./Miami Herald,Man o’ war are on South Florida beaches.

4/4/2022,"LONDON (AP) — The prevalence of COVID-19 in the U.K. has reached record levels, with about 1 in 13 people estimated to be infected with the virus in the past week, according to the latest figures from Britain's official statistics agency. Some 4.9 million people were estimated to have the coronavirus in the week ending March 26, up from 4.3 million recorded in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. The latest surge is driven by the more transmissible omicron variant BA.2, which is the dominant variant across the U.K. Hospitalizations and death rates are again rising, although the number of people dying with COVID-19 is still relatively low compared with earlier this year. Nonetheless, the latest estimates suggest that the steep climb in new infections since late February, when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson scrapped all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England, has continued well into March. The figures came on the same day the government ended free rapid COVID-19 tests for most people in England, under Johnson's “living with COVID” plan. People who do not have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus now need to pay for tests to find out if they are infected. “The government's ‘living with COVID’ strategy of removing any mitigations, isolation, free testing and a considerable slice of our surveillance amounts to nothing more than ignoring this virus going forwards,” said Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds' medical school. “Such unchecked prevalence endangers the protection afforded by our vaccines,” he said. “Our vaccines are excellent, but they are not silver bullets and ought not to be left to bear the brunt of COVID in isolation.” More than 67% of people 12 years old and above in the U.K. have been vaccinated and had their booster or a third dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Beginning Saturday, parents can also book a low-dose vaccine for children between 5 to 12 years old in England. James Naismith, a biology professor at the University of Oxford, said he believed that except for those who are completely shielded or not susceptible to the virus, most people in the country would likely be infected with the BA.2 variant by the summer. “This is literally living with the virus by being infected with it,"" he said. ___ Follow all AP stories on the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic.",World/Associated Press,UK hits record COVID-19 levels; nearly 5 million infected,https://news.yahoo.com/covid-uk-record-levels-almost-110942989.html
