2/28/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a televised statement on Sunday that he was ordering Russia's nuclear deterrent forces on alert, as he continues his unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Driving the news: Speaking alongside his defense minister and military chief of staff, Putin said recent sanctions and ""aggressive statements"" from NATO countries had led him to put the nuclear deterrent forces in a “special regime of combat duty."" Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. This is the second time Putin has alluded to Russia's nuclear arsenal while effectively warning the West to back off. In a statement at the onset of the invasion, Putin said anyone who tried to ""hinder us"" would face ""such consequences that you have never encountered in your history."" Fear of a standoff between nuclear powers is a large part of the reason the U.S. and its NATO allies have been so adamant that they will not send troops to Ukraine. The latest: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that a Ukrainian delegation would meet with a Russian delegation for peace talks ""without preconditions"" on the border between Ukraine and Belarus. State of play: U.S. and Ukrainian officials say Russia's invasion is not going to plan due to stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance. The Kremlin and state media continue to tell Russians that no ""war"" or ""invasion"" is taking place, but instead states there's a limited defensive operation in eastern Ukraine. The large protests in Moscow and St. Petersburg, despite the threat of mass arrests, indicate that many Russians aren't buying it. What to watch: Having already threatened any independent publications that report on Russian casualties or aggression with censorship, the government is preparing to crack down harder on its citizens. The Kremlin today announced that ""the provision of any assistance to a foreign state"" during the ""military operation"" would be considered treason, carrying a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.

2/28/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) -British Airways (BA) said it would cancel all short-haul flights from London's Heathrow airport until midday on Saturday as it deals with an IT failure. The airline has said the problem, which came to light on Friday and affected its website, app, and airport operations, was not caused by a cyber attack but was a hardware issue. BA has been caught up in tit-for-tat bans by Russia and Britain that have stopped their respective national carriers from using each other's airspace. ""We are extremely sorry that due to the continuing technical issues we are facing we have regrettably had to cancel all short-haul flights from Heathrow today until midday,"" the airline said in a statement. ""Our long-haul services at Heathrow and all flights at Gatwick and London City Airport are due to operate as planned, but customers may experience some delays. Our website ba.com is working and customers can check-in online and at the airport,"" the airline said. It advised passengers to check on its website for the latest information before travelling to the airport as more disruption was expected. BA, owned by IAG, was hit by a major computer system failure in 2017 that stranded 75,000 passengers over a holiday weekend, sparking a public relations disaster and pledges from the carrier that it would do better in future. The company said customers would be offered a full refund for cancelled services or could rebook at a later date for free. ""We know we have let our customers down and we will do everything we can to make this up to them – but for now our focus is on getting as many customers and flights away as we can.""
