5/14/2022,"At the start, the concept behind the new dating show Let’s Make a Love Scene (Channel 4) sounds complicated, though it does eventually reveal itself to be a lot of faff around one simple question: out of three options, who does one person fancy the most? The host, Ellie Taylor, who does a lot of the comedic heavy lifting, explains that this is a dating show that “does it like the movies”. It tries to find out whether you can “test sexual chemistry by faking it”, which doesn’t make much sense when you think it through. “It happens in the movies, so why not in real life?” Taylor asks, a question that, thankfully, nobody has thought to apply to Jurassic Park. Ultimately, this is sexy cosplay on a Dinner Date platter. In this week’s first episode, a leading man has to reenact three steamy scenes from the movies with three leading ladies, and at the end of all that snogging and grinding, he picks his favourite woman for a proper date. Apparently, the leading ladies are film buffs who have definitely chosen the movies all by themselves because they like them so much, and are absolutely not just given a film containing a sex scene by the producers. They then have to perform in their own versions of those sex scenes. This week, that’s key moments from 9½ Weeks, Mr & Mrs Smith and Out of Sight, with the lucky lead, 22-year-old Lailand, who plays rugby and clearly knows how to flirt. Asking two strangers to simulate sex for the cameras without first establishing boundaries and comfort levels would not be very 2022, so naturally there is an acting coach and an intimacy consultant on hand, who mostly stand around trying to get the fledgling couple to pretend they are acting, and not just being given a free pass to kiss each other while playing dress-up. (This show is, surely, a nightmare for anyone in a relationship with an actor.) “What are they thinking and feeling?” says the acting coach, in an attempt to get Lailand to inhabit his character in 9½ Weeks. He considers this carefully. “He’d probably have a boner,” he says. Inside the Actors Studio, indeed. Instead of simply showing us the recreations of the sex scenes, though, they show us all the work that went into them. It’s not so much that little is left to the imagination, it’s that the imagination is ditched completely: film sets are, generally, very dull places with more waiting around than this summer’s airport queues. Now, whenever you see Out of Sight, don’t think of J.Lo confidently and slowly stripping off in front of George Clooney. Instead, think of a self-confessed cougar from Wales and a young man amused by his enormous boxers on a shonky set. There is a camera crew shouting things like, “Shove it in!” (minds out of the gutter, this is still mainstream television) and “Let’s have a little bucket on standby?” Taylor is deadpan when necessary, the programme has enough self-awareness to recognise its own trashiness, and there are moments when the absurdity is amusing (“The eggs and the jelly bit aside, that’s quite steamy”). But clearly nobody on this show is looking for love. I do love the potential for romance on a dating show – this lot are all just looking for a bit of telly time. The problem is that once you get past the gimmick, this is just the familiar format of three dates followed by a winner, and I don’t think I’ve seen a single dating show like it where it hasn’t been obvious who will be chosen from the second they meet. It’s just that here, they have to do slightly more than cook each other dinner. As I said, it looks like a faff.",Arts/Television & radio,"Let’s Make a Love Scene review – silly, sexy cosplay inspired by Swayze and Clooney",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/13/lets-make-a-love-scene-review-silly-sexy-cosplay-inspired-by-swayze-and-clooney
5/14/2022,"The Queen and Barbie are both icons, so the combination was sure to be hot property – now a special platinum jubilee doll has sold out and become the subject of fierce bidding on eBay. John Lewis said its stock of the £95 doll sold out in three seconds, and most eBay sellers are now hoping to sell the sought-after collectible for at least double that. The toy is the latest product of a lucrative royal memorabilia industry that spans everything from fine china to teddy bears, tea towels to fridge magnets, and cranks into action around big royal events like jubilees and weddings. In recent years, Barbie, who has also had a long reign and is now in her early 60s, has sought to prove she is more than a fashion plate, with a side hustle in inspiring women such as Florence Nightingale, Helen Keller and Maya Angelou. The doll’s face has been sculpted to look like the Queen’s, and Barbie’s famous blond hair has been replaced with a severe grey coiffure topped with a tiara based on the one she wore on her wedding day. The outfit is also a nod to the look favoured by the Queen in royal portraits – an ivory gown with a blue riband pinned with miniature medallions inspired by the royal family orders. The effect is completed by a “premium” box that depicts the doll set against a background of a throne and red carpet inspired by the throne room at Buckingham Palace. Mattel, which manufactures Barbie dolls, confirmed that the limited-edition doll had sold out in the UK, but hinted that more could be released before next month’s celebrations.",News/UK news,Platinum jubilee Queen Barbie sells out in three seconds,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/platinum-jubilee-queen-barbie-doll-sells-out-three-seconds
5/14/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said that he understands why Pep Guardiola believes the entire country wants Liverpool to win the title but Chelsea’s manager does not mind if his side are “the bad guys” in Saturday’s FA Cup final. Asked about Guardiola’s claim that “people want Liverpool to win more than us”, Tuchel was quick to side with Manchester City’s manager. “I’m not a Liverpool fan,” he said. “I can understand why he has that feeling. In general I would say it is hard to really argue with it. I did not say I agree 100% but I can see. There is a huge sympathy for Liverpool in the country.” Tuchel was in an entertaining mood before Chelsea attempt to avoid defeat in the Cup final for the third consecutive year. He spoke admiringly of Jürgen Klopp’s oratorical skills, affectionately referring to his fellow German as “Kloppo”, as he considered why people are more sympathetic towards Liverpool. “Kloppo is the master of being the underdog,” he said. “He can talk you into being the underdog against Villarreal and against Benfica, and it’s a miracle how they even draw against them. He does it all the time. That’s part of it, where the sympathy comes. “There’s nothing to be jealous of; Kloppo is a fantastic guy, funny guy, one of the best coaches in the world and that’s what he does. When he trained Dortmund, the whole country loved Dortmund. Now he trains Liverpool and you have the feeling the whole country loves Liverpool. “It’s a big credit to him and this is what you deal with if you play a team against him. But it’s always the fun part and so if we are the bad guys tomorrow, then no problem. We take that role. We don’t want to have the sympathy of the country tomorrow – we want to have the trophy.” Tuchel, who hopes N’Golo Kanté and Mateo Kovacic will be fit to start in midfield, admitted that Liverpool’s history wins them support. “It is also because of Jürgen, but in general what this club stands for and how they run the business, and how the fans push their team. If you fight against it, like Pep for many, many years, I can understand that it feels sometimes like this.” It was put to Tuchel, whose side were unfortunate to lose the Carabao Cup final to Liverpool on penalties, that he can match Klopp’s charisma. “Just be self-confident and do your thing,” he said. “I was even the guy after him at Dortmund. But I have nothing but biggest respect for what he’s doing. He is like one with the supporters and the club. He is the charismatic leader of this huge club. My players have to step up against it and I have to step up against it. We cannot be bullied. It is not possible.” Tuchel, who had lunch on Thursday with the prospective new owner Todd Boehly, said victory for Chelsea would make up for their failure to challenge City and Liverpool in the league. Chelsea, who have won the European Super Cup and the Club World Cup, know they can derail Liverpool’s quadruple bid. Tuchel expects a tight game and he will tell his side to target Liverpool’s high defensive line. “They allow chances,” he said. “We proved it – we had big chances in the Carabao Cup final. But it’s their approach. They are the team who put strikers of other teams into offside by far the most. They only play this high line because they always have pressure on the ball. It’s very hard to exploit these spaces because you need perfect timing. But you can find solutions if you have a perfect day.” Tuchel hinted that Romelu Lukaku, who has three goals in his last two games, could start. But he admitted he could have done without the distraction of Lukaku’s agent, Federico Pastorello, saying he plans to hold talks with Chelsea’s new owners over the striker’s future. Pastorello admitted “there was a problem” earlier this season but he dismissed suggestions of the Belgian joining Internazionale or Milan this summer. Lukaku distanced himself from his agent’s comments. “Never ever will I let someone speak for me,” he said on Instagram. “I kept my mouth shut and focused on helping the team the best way as possible. So if someone out there trying to say something about me and the club… not in my name.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel doesn’t mind if Chelsea are ‘the bad guys’ in FA Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/thomas-tuchel-doesnt-mind-chelsea-bad-guys-fa-cup-final-liverpool-jurgen-klopp
5/14/2022,"Frank Lampard has said Dominic Calvert-Lewin remains “absolutely focused” on ensuring Everton’s Premier League survival despite links with a summer move. Arsenal and Newcastle are reportedly interested in the England international, who has suffered an injury-plagued season but is fit for the final three matches. Everton are likely to have to sell to raise funds for Lampard this summer even in the event of staying in the Premier League, having recorded huge financial losses over the past three years. But the manager insists Calvert-Lewin had not had his head turned or indicated he wishes to leave. “He has not said anything to me like that,” the manager said. “He trains well and we speak a lot, and he’s said nothing like that. I’m not silly, this is football and he’s a player that would be wanted by clubs because of the level of player he is. There are not many strikers out there. They cost a lot of money. I am not worried about him at all and I wouldn’t be worried about playing him in these games. He is absolutely focused on the job. He’s been a big player for Everton and Everton have been a big club for him in his career.” Calvert-Lewin has started only 12 Premier League games this season but, with safety in Everton’s hands before home games against Brentford and Crystal Palace, Lampard is hopeful the forward can still have an impact. “He has three years left on his contract, and I want to take this club forward,” he said. “Players like Dominic help that. I know he hasn’t been playing at the minute because he’s been getting fit but now he’s fit so hopefully he’ll contribute in these last few games for starters.” Lampard plans to hold talks with several players, including Fabian Delph, about their futures but only once Everton’s position is resolved. He said: “With some players the message will be quite clear – see you on 1 July or whenever the start of pre-season is – and with others you would probably have conversations about how they see it, how they think the season went, what does the future look like for whatever reason, such as contractually. “Delphy is a good example of that. It has been parked because of the situation we are in. Let’s get clarity of where we are going to finish and then those conversations can happen pretty quickly.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard insists Dominic Calvert-Lewin remains focused at Everton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/frank-lampard-insists-dominic-calvert-lewin-remains-focused-at-everton
