2/6/2022,"Travellers have been warned to check their half-term holiday plans to make sure they meet Covid vaccination rules when travelling to EU destinations as a growing number of countries impose new restrictions. France joined Spain and Denmark last week in requiring anyone who completed their vaccination jabs more than 270 days ago to have a booster to enter the country – or be considered unvaccinated. Austria requires boosters after 180 days.  It means that any of the 18 million people in the UK who had their second dose before mid-May in 2021 would need to have been boosted if they travel to those countries on Saturday, 12 February. Yet only 65% of over-12s have had a booster so far. People travelling to Italy, Croatia and Switzerland, as well as New York or California, will not face the same border checks but may find it harder to go to restaurants, museums and other indoor venues if they have not been boosted. Tourism leaders urged ministers to negotiate with European countries to prevent chaotic scenes at airports as the travel industry begins to revive. “It is too late now for regulations to change [before half term],” said Chris Rowles, the chair of Aito, which represents specialist travel companies. “Travellers, especially with children under 18, will have to be careful and well aware of individual countries’ regulations to ensure they can travel without problems.” The EU had been trying to develop a common approach between the 27 member states, he said, but they had taken different approaches. “What our government must do is negotiate with the EU to ensure that we are included in any joint EU regulations to make travel more seamless across Europe,” Rowles said, adding that the rules should be agreed for all four nations in the UK. Craig Burton, managing director of Ski Solutions, said most skiers had been aware of the issues, but the different restrictions had made things “really complicated”, particularly for families with children under 12, most of whom cannot be vaccinated in the UK, but face vaccine requirements in some countries. “We have heard of some people getting caught out by the passport validity rules, when they’re dusting down their passport for the first time in a couple of years,” Burton said. EU rules require travellers from third countries such as the UK to have a passport issued within the last 10 years – some British passports include extra months if they were renewed early. Rules within countries sounded “scary”, Burton added, “but it’s manageable”. “I was in Italy last week. They have the ‘super green pass’ [to prove vaccination status]. You download the QR code from your NHS app and save it as a screensaver, show it at the ski lifts and away you go.” Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy the PC Agency, said: “Overall, it’s clear that we’re in a no-man’s-land phase coming out of the pandemic. It’s causing a lot of confusion because people are having to do calculations about when they’ve had the vaccine, and, if they’ve got children, whether they’ve had enough vaccines. “We’re seeing a jigsaw puzzle of restrictions emerging, and customers will choose somewhere that’s easier to go. This is a key booking period for the summer holidays, and France is going to lose out enormously.” Tom Jenkins, the chief executive of ETOA, the trade association for tour operators in European destinations, said most travellers would not be surprised to have to navigate complex restrictions. “What people probably aren’t prepared for is the scrutiny that British passport holders are going to be subjected to once they arrive in Europe,” he said. “This has been a phenomenon at the margins of most travellers’ awareness. Now they’re going to find themselves in the midst of it. We’re used to seeing non-EU travellers standing in a queue to get into Paris or Italy. Now British nationals will be part of that queue.” Since the UK formally left the EU on 1 January 2021, British travellers have faced passport checks. With traveller numbers depressed by the pandemic, that has not made much difference to the experience of many people so far. But as the volume of British tourists increases, they will test the capacity of officials in some destinations to process non-EU travellers. The appetite for foreign holidays appears to be returning.

2/6/2022,"Athrowaway moment in Monica Ali’s new novel introduces us to a minor character, an unpublished young black author who, when he talks of struggling to sell his manuscript – a futuristic thriller about an eco-terrorist attack on a billionaire’s post-apocalyptic bolthole in New Zealand – finds himself told to try something “closer to home”; drop the sci-fi, in other words, and write about being black in Britain today.You sense Ali speaks of what she knows; born in Dhaka and raised in England, she has arguably spent her whole career to date wriggling in the jaws of publishing’s authenticity fetish. Brick Lane, her bestselling 2003 debut about a Bangladeshi teenager’s arranged marriage in east London, earned her a reputation as a vital voice of multicultural Britain – which meant no one quite knew what to make of her next book, Alentejo Blue, tales of village life in rural Portugal. She fared better with In the Kitchen, about migrant labour in London; less so – putting it mildly - with the counterfactual shenanigans of Untold Story, in which Princess Diana, fearing assassination, fakes her own death and relocates to the US after cosmetic surgery in Brazil.The pattern – one novel a market-pleaser, the next a curious left turn – continues with Ali’s latest book, which is set in London in the wake of the Brexit vote and centres on Yasmin, a trainee doctor who is the daughter of Bengali immigrants. She’s about to marry her colleague, Joe, who lives with his subtly domineering mother, Harriet, a feminist academic still famous for posing nude in her 70s heyday.The setup starts off as giggly meet-the-parents comedy, with early laughs coming at the expense of the malapropisms and wonky grammar of Yasmin’s head-wobbling mother, Anisah, who mistakes a Howard Hodgkin painting on Harriet’s wall for a long-cherished childhood artwork by Joe. For his part, Joe faces embarrassment of his own when his mother’s self-congratulatory liberalism all but corners his fiancee into planning a Muslim wedding against her will.  As Ali pokes fun at the unwitting ironies of one-size-fits-all feminism, the easy gags soon give way to the drama of a busy plot rife with secrets and lies. Yasmin gets a shock when a nurse on her ward lifts the lid on Joe’s double life, foreshadowed in segments told from his therapist’s point of view. An even more seismic upset follows the revelation that her parents’ cross-class marriage was a murkier affair than let on by the family lore of an unarranged love match.We stick chiefly to Yasmin’s perspective, her self-image slowly unravelling once she begins to grasp the nature of the shadow cast by her increasingly hard-drinking father, also a doctor. Private turmoil is amplified by ever-present workplace aggro, as Ali portrays a hard-pressed NHS prey to dodgy contractors and hidebound hierarchies, with a whistleblower subplot involving overmedicated geriatrics. There’s also lashings of sex, thanks to Yasmin’s suave older superior, an outlet for tit-for-tat infidelity; more lurid turns involve Joe’s relationship with his mother, whose readiness to walk in on him in the shower (among other liberties) further brings into relief Yasmin’s body-conscious inhibitions, before paving the way for a gnarly Oedipal storyline.If the novel’s mickey-taking of Harriet as a superannuated pin-up of second-wave feminism feels especially pointed, it may be relevant that Germaine Greer once wrote sharply on the row over Brick Lane, suggesting non-Asian readers trusted its portrayal of British Bangladeshis simply because Ali had a Bangladeshi father, a fact that counted for less “in the eyes of British Bangladeshis”... some of whom “did not recognise themselves”. Either way, Harriet’s story, like everyone’s here, is ultimately about sympathy, not score-settling. Even Ali’s broadest strokes – as when Anisah falls for a lesbian performance artist – butter us up for a sucker-punch climax in which a variety of buried sorrows come to light. We all, the novel seems to say, have our cross to bear, even overweening mums and dads, and (as Yasmin ends up thinking) “life is not simple”: a last-page banality brought to life by dint of the accumulated backstory generously granted to each member of the book’s two families. A topically freighted tale of premarital tension told with easy-reading propulsion, Love Marriage has the air of a surefire hit, and at the very least deserves to underwrite whatever curveball Ali has up her sleeve for next time: roll on the eco-thriller.

2/6/2022,"This time last year, Sarah (not her real name) was a regular donor to the food bank drop-off point outside her local Sainsbury’s. But in March 2021 she had to stop. Despite working full-time and being on universal credit, the mother of two has for the past few months had to rely on food banks. “I have gone from being an average working-class citizen to somebody who’s in poverty,” said the 44-year-old Londoner. She is one of a growing number of former donors who, food aid workers report, are now turning to food banks themselves as the soaring cost of living expands the demographic of people struggling to afford food.  “It’s so distressing to see the numbers of people coming who have never been in this position before,” said Sabine Goodwin of Independent Food Aid Network. “We’re seeing people who hadn’t even had to contemplate using a food bank, who might have been donating to a food bank this time last year. And it’s happening in every part of the country.” A Food Standards Agency survey published last month found that between April and June last year, 15% of people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were food insecure (which means they were facing either reduced quality, variety or desirability of diet, or disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake) and 4% reported visiting a food bank in the past 12 months. But the numbers are believed to have grown considerably. Research by poverty charity Turn2us found that four in 10 of those on universal credit – about 2.5 million people – would be unable to afford food after the axing in October of the £20 uplift. Sarah’s journey to poverty started when the breakdown of her 20-year relationship led to her moving out of her family home in March. But the soaring cost of food and fuel combined with rent, her share of childcare costs, and October’s universal credit cut, meant she was soon struggling to make ends meet. Now she thinks of going to the dentist as an unaffordable luxury, cannot afford after-school clubs for her teenage children and avoids turning the heating on. Without access to a food bank, she said, “my options would be just bread and butter, really. I would be going hungry”. When she first visited the food bank in June, she was ashamed. “I felt like ‘should I really be here? Am I in need enough?’ It was a really bad feeling. But luckily the team there were amazing and put me at ease very quickly.” Even with food banks, she still struggles to get enough to eat. “You really have to be mindful what you buy because you can’t get everything from the food bank.” Sarah, who now also volunteers at a food bank, said there should be more walk-in hubs offering food along with advice on the “too complicated” benefits system. As well as looming energy price rises, Sarah also faces moving flat and paying more rent. “I don’t know what I’m going to do,” she sighs. “It’s so mega expensive.” Demand for food banks had been growing since the start of the pandemic, but in recent months, numbers have grown exponentially. Charlotte White, manager of Earlsfield food bank in south-west London, said those relying on them have increased from 25-30 people a week to well over 100 households. “We’re terrified by what we’re seeing,” she said. “In the past two months it has gone crazy, in terms of the volume we’re seeing, but also the complexity of the problems and issues people are coming in with.” Former food bank donors, volunteers and support workers are turning to them, as are growing numbers of families and, for the first time, people with mortgages. “People will say, ‘I used to give to food banks and now I need you.’ We have also had some of our volunteers saying, ‘Could I take a bag today? Is that OK?’.” As many as 50% of the people Earlsfield helps are in work. “The guests we’ve seen for a long time are suffering more than ever, and we have this whole load of new guests needing us for the first time.” Paul O’Brien of social justice charity Micah Liverpool has seen the use of its food bank grow steadily since the universal credit cut. He predicts another influx of new registrations from April, when fuel prices rise. He wants more action from the government. “There are only so many food banks,” he said. “The pressure on the third sector is just too great.” Broke Not Broken, which runs a food bank in Perth and Kinross, has doubled its opening hours to meet demand and is helping more working people – including families with two working parents. “Before Covid, the reason most people used us was benefit sanctions. That’s not the case now,” said Annie McCormack, the charity’s chair. “Now pretty much every referral is here because of low incomes, or because they’re waiting to be moved on to universal credit, which takes a minimum of five weeks.” She worries how her small charity will survive. “We need to think seriously about how we continue. It’s a challenging question because we need more and more volunteers to be able to deliver parcels. Last April, we thought we could see the light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel is never-ending now.”",News/Society,‘We’re terrified at what we’re seeing’: food banks tell of soaring demand,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/food-bank-donor-to-to-user-soaring-demand-for-aid
2/6/2022,"Made up in equal parts of emotional pop bangers and riveting electronic anomie, Mitski’s hotly anticipated fifth album does not disappoint. This Japanese American indie artist’s strides towards the mainstream are laced with resonant themes; disembodied hands, cleanliness and “the dark” recur as images. The hooks are sharp. A series of tunes skew hard towards sleek, oversaturated 80s pop. In addition to the maximalist cris de coeur The Only Heartbreaker and Love Me More – both previously released – Mitski packs in bouncy romps such as Should’ve Been Me, outlining the pitfalls of a relationship with deceptive orchestral cheer. The dulcet Americana of Heat Lightning could sit easily alongside the notionally more commercial work of Lana Del Rey.  And yet the mesmerising album opener – Valentine, Texas – and its devastating midpoint – Everyone – cast Mitski as an altogether more frightening artist, a fierce being with “wet teeth”, one who ill-advisedly invites in “the dark” to take “whatever it wants”. “But it didn’t want me/ Yet,” she notes, a phrase pregnant with unresolved tension and dissonant musicality. This is an album that wrestles with the sisyphean slog of remaining engaged – with love, with work, with life.

2/6/2022,"Iscored a two in Wordle the other day. God. The rush, as the five squares in the second line blinked green, one by one, touched on the sublime. I felt like Mary Magdalen in the Caravaggio painting, lost in ecstasy. Oh mama. Up until this point, I had considered that those who found the solution in two guesses were simply lucky. Consistent threes and fours – this was a surer marker of Wordle prowess. Once I had scored a two myself, however, I began to doubt this hypothesis. Surely, only the most elite players could manage such a feat. Surely, I was now part of this pantheon.  How did I do it, I hear ye mortals enquire? How did I reach ROBOT in two? Why, a combination of stellar start word (RATES), impeccable logic and a poetic appreciation of the Wordle lexicon, which appears to offer an oblique commentary on 21st life (TROLL… PROXY… PRICK…). No doubt this has helped the internet word puzzle to become, as one Twitter wag put it, “The sourdough starter of Omicron”, spreading at the same speed as its companion variant. According to the (non-affiliated) account @WordleStats, the number of people sharing their Wordle scores was roughly doubling each week in January: from 137,586 on 12 January to 280,622 on 19 January. This is just the people who are sharing their scores; there are perhaps millions more, Wordling in private. Not since the Sudoku-mania of the mid-00s, or perhaps even the first crossword craze of the 1910s, has a novel puzzle so captured the zeitgeist. The Wordle origin story is already part of the nano-mythology of the internet – it was designed by the British programmer, Josh Wardle, as a present for his girlfriend, Palak Shah, who was a fan of the New York Times’s Spelling Bee game. The beauty lies in its simplicity. You have to guess a five-letter word. You have six guesses. It would be addictive were the entire English-speaking world not rationed to a single hit per day. “One puzzle a day with exactly one solution. There is something almost religious about it, no?” wrote the American author Brandon Taylor in an essay on his Substack newsletter. “There is something peculiarly Calvinist about Wordle, or perhaps Wordle illuminates something particularly Calvinist about digital scarcity.” I logged on to Twitter to proselytise my miracle score – only to be confronted by a guy who had got it in one. A total fluke, obviously. What is it about these silly games that compels us so? Why do I experience a little rush of joy, each day, when I remember there’s still the Wordle to do? Alan Connor, author of Two Girls, One on Each Knee, a history of the crossword, notes that the pandemic has provided the perfect conditions for an upsurge of interest in word games of all kinds. “It’s no surprise that those who have had more time alone should see the appeal in losing themselves in a puzzle for a spell, but it also works for those who’ve been run off their feet: a puzzle is, at least, something you can feel you’ve finished.” Connor sees Wordle as a “charming gateway” to the world of “moving letters around for the sheer pleasure of it”, but it is far from the only distraction we have turned to. The crossword setters and puzzle compilers he knows report that they’ve never had so much interest. Publications from the Sun to the Telegraph to the New Yorker have upped their puzzle content in recent months – and this was from a position of strength. On the 100th anniversary of the crossword in 2013, Connor commissioned a YouGov survey on the popularity of the crossword and found that three in 10 British adults attempted a crossword each week and more than one in five made their decision to buy a newspaper based on the particular crossword culture of the publication. The solution to the clue that forms the title of his book is PATELLA, by the way. Like so many word puzzles, Wordle is really a numbers game masquerading as a letters game, according to mathematician Alex Bellos, Guardian puzzle compiler and author of the Language Lover’s Puzzle Book. “You’ll find that the people who are really brilliant at word games are mathematical. It’s quite often maths graduates who win the international Scrabble competitions and set cryptic crosswords.” The crucial strategy is that of “exhaustion”, he says – which is maybe why I’m so good at it. No, not that sort of exhaustion: “You have a finite number of solutions and you have to exhaustively look at every permutation and combination. It’s a natural instinct for mathematicians. You also have to be drawn to the non-human, a bit like a robot, working through letters in every different position.” Yet really successful puzzle games seem to share certain irresistible human elements, too – competition, status-seeking and superstition. Everyone Bellos knows has now arrived at a favourite first word, he says. “They are probably quite protective of them, too. They’re almost like lucky charms.” The author Laura Shepherd-Robinson tells me she used to have RATIO as her starter word. “Then I made the mistake of telling my husband,” she says. “He would work backwards from that knowledge when he saw my little yellow and green score on Twitter. So I’ve had to mix it up now. He is insufferable if he gets it in two or three.” My own feeling is that word games – like chord sequences, like chess, like translating a Russian sonnet into English while retaining the same metrical form – lie in the sweetspot between maths and art, logic and creativity, left brain and right. It’s the same metaphysical zone in which you would find Jorge Luis Borges’s Library of Babel, containing books with every possible permutation of 25 characters arranged over 410 pages of 40 lines each. Somewhere, amid the apparent randomness of the seemingly indefinite but not quite infinite library, there must exist a book containing the key to the universe. And also, its refutation. Word games are “about breaking meaning down to its atomic units,” says Adrienne Raphel, author of Thinking Inside the Box, a history of word puzzles. “When they are put together the letters make sense – but pull them apart and they have a different kind of elemental power. It taps into the primal instinct that we have where we see letters and we have to play with them.” Letter blocks are, of course, one of the first toys we give to toddlers. When Raphel first encountered Wordle, she was struck by the grid’s similarity to the Roman “magic square”, one of the earliest and most enduring of word games. A magic square is a grid of letters where the words read the same across as they do down. In English, magic squares of up to nine letters across have been constructed. A 10x10 is seen as the holy grail. But the most famous example is the SATOR 5x5 square, a palindrome, which reads: SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS (roughly: “farmer Arepo works with a wheel”). It is one of the most common forms of Roman graffiti, turning up everywhere from Pompeii to Syria to Cirencester but its meaning is unknown. It may have been a charm for warding off evil spirits, or a way for early Christians to signal their presence to one another. “In Roman times, people delighted in the idea of remixing the same letters and getting new words,” Raphel says. “It must have seemed magical.” She detects similar properties in the game Boggle, in which the player must find the words snaking through a 4x4 grid of random letters. “It’s the magic feeling of creating a chaos of symbol, from which patterns emerge. People think of it as this junior cousin to Scrabble – I actually think Scrabble is inferior.” Maya Angelou would have been with her – the great poet was a Boggle nut and held regular tournaments in her Harlem home. But as a recovering Scrabble addict (I developed a seriously bad online habit in the mid-00s) I would maintain that Scrabble has its own life lessons to impart. A rookie player will often fixate on the word they can nearly make with their tiles, or moan about the constraints of the board. “Can’t make a thing with these darned letters!” they will cry. But the darned letters are the point. You must operate on the board in front of you with the constraints that you have. As in life. There is, of course, great art to creating a puzzle – just as there is a science to creating a perfect rhyme. “A good clue can give you all the pleasures of being duped that a mystery story can,” said Stephen Sondheim, who compiled cryptic crosswords. “It has surface innocence, surprise, the revelation of a concealed meaning, and the catharsis of solution.” Vladimir Nabokov composed chess problems and saw them in much the same way. “Chess problems demand from the composer the same virtues that characterise all worthwhile art: originality, invention, conciseness, harmony, complexity and splendid insincerity.” He additionally published the first known crosswords in Russian, admiring “their geometric, closed structure… reminiscent of chess”. One could begin to think that word games were the stuff of life itself. Or, perhaps, the inverse, an enormous waste of life. There’s something rather disturbing about the relish with which the husband in Brief Encounter attacks his Times crossword while poor Celia Johnson pines away. Connor points out that there was once a moral panic about the crossword – “coming here from America and wasting workers’ time” – before it became seen as a respectable, intellectual pastime. But in the 21st century – and this would be a very 21st century way of seeing things – we are more apt to see these things as means of “optimising” ourselves to ever-greater efficiency. Shepherd-Robinson canvasses her online group of writers (all Wordle nuts) and finds them split on the matter. Some see Wordle as just another form of procrastination. She, and many others, however, see it as a “warm-up exercise” for the day’s intellectual labours. “Wordle uses the same part of my brain that I’m using when I’m really wrestling with a plot,” she says. Essentially, it’s a logic problem, isn’t it? You are narrowing the path to the right answer. That’s exactly how I approach a book.” Even if it is a form of timewasting, though, it’s a relatively safe one, given that you have to wait 24 hours for each new puzzle. This is entirely deliberate. Wardle had worked in Silicon Valley, where software designers typically try to capture as much of your attention as they possibly can: by making the game endless, by sending you constant push notifications, by encouraging you to collect “gems” or build your “streak” (see: Duolingo, Simply Piano, the ghastly official Scrabble app, etc). “Philosophically, I enjoy doing the opposite of all those things… which I think has bizarrely had this effect where the game feels really human and just enjoyable,” he told Slate. This is what the author Brandon Taylor was driving at in his essay on Wordle. The internet once promised to be a space of boundless freedom, where we could each be fully ourselves. Social media has, however, brought about something like the opposite. As soon as anyone shares something interesting or funny or clever or cool, others imitate it and soon everyone is tweeting the same memes, idioms and ideas. Everyone is always “optimising” whether they realise it or not. As such, Taylor resists any temptation to share his first word, his score or his strategy. “I don’t want to be a replicant. I don’t want to be a cyborg. I don’t want to be just like everyone else, playing the same words and solving the puzzle in the same way.” He wants to do it in his own dumb way. Which seems pretty smart to me. And in short bursts, a word game can offer a respite from the endless imperatives of ambition, competition, optimisation. “When language is so often weaponised and over-scrutinised, it can be hugely curative to turn words into nothing more than pieces in a game,” says Connor. Bellos sees such games as the mental equivalent of isolating a muscle in the gym. “It’s pure concentration,” he says. “And when you do enter this cocoon of concentration, you forget about everything else in the world. You’re focused on this one small, elegant, aesthetically pleasing thing. For a few minutes, it’s a beautiful world.” He stops himself. “God, I sound pretentious.”",Arts/Games,Spell bound: the enduring appeal of word puzzles,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/06/spell-bound-the-enduring-appeal-of-word-puzzles
2/6/2022,"This week I’ve been to Istanbul, New York, Guangzhou, Turin, Bangkok and the Arctic, among other places. And that was just by Thursday. I want to say ‘sadly this was via a box of chocolates’, but I’m actually not sad at all, because they were absolutely terrific. Fifth Dimension chocolates marry super luxe handmade chocolates with tastes from around the world.  Every day I sat down and read my menu which told me about the ingredients and their global inspiration. Biepu, for example, is from when the makers (Albert and Russell) travelled to Taiwan and made Hakka tea using sesame seeds and peanuts – thus both ingredients appear in the chocolate. (Biepu was a favourite. I sighed after eating it.) Siem Reap (Cambodian curry) is white chocolate with lemongrass, galangal, coconut and chilli. Hong Kong is milk chocolate with a soy sauce caramel. You get the idea. It may sound sad, but every day I looked forward to my little chocolate (I had a box of 12 – some days I did travel to more than one place, truth be told). January was a particularly anhedonic month for me, as it nearly always is. I usually try to go away in January, but travel isn’t easy at the moment is it? I found myself often looking up the city/town the chocolate was named after and finding out a bit more about its ingredients. Prices start at £22.60 for a box of 12.

2/6/2022,"Facebook was much in the news last week, although you may not realise that because it has been renamed Meta in the hope the bad vibes associated with its maiden name would gradually fade from public memory. (Google tried the same stunt with Alphabet and that hasn’t worked either.) For a change, though, Facebook’s latest moment at the top of the news agenda had nothing to do with scandals and everything to do with its financial results, which were so unexpectedly bad that the shares dropped 25% at one point, taking $240bn (£177bn) off its market value, which in turn led to a 2% drop in the Nasdaq index.  Given that Facebook has hitherto been a licence to print money, so much so that at one stage (in 2019), when it was fined $5bn by the Federal Trade Commission, its shares actually went up as Wall Street registered that the ostensibly massive fine was actually the equivalent of a fleabite on an elephant. But this time was different. Why? Three factors stood out from reports of Mark Zuckerberg’s conference call with stock market analysts: the impact of TikTok; Apple’s move to require iPhone users to consent to being tracked by advertisers; and the revelation that the hitherto unstoppable growth in the number of Facebook users has stalled. Zuckerberg’s newfound obsession with TikTok must have puzzled many observers. After all, TikTok is not a social network. It’s a service that hosts short-form user videos, from genres such as pranks, stunts, tricks, jokes, dance and entertainment. It is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is understood by nobody over the age of 40 and has taken the world by storm. As a form of Chinese cultural imperialism, it makes Xi Jinping’s belt-and-road initiative look amateurish. So why is it keeping Zuckerberg awake at night? The answer is that TikTok caters brilliantly to a demographic group – so-called young adults – that Facebook, with its ageing demographics (parents and grandparents), doesn’t seem to serve well any more. This explains its zeal to re-energise Reels (its ludicrous attempt to mimic the short-video genre) and to reprioritise young adults in its other offerings. But the real problem for Facebook is that TikTok is monopolising its users’ attention, which is where the money for surveillance capitalism comes from. As Ben Thompson, the veteran tech analyst, puts it: “The problem for Meta is that its business isn’t based on surfacing content from your friends; it’s based on engagement and serving ads, which means any service that occupies your time and attention – and TikTok occupies a lot of it – is a fundamental threat.” The second source of woe for Facebook is the impact of Apple’s “app-tracking transparency” (ATT) feature, introduced last year with version 14.5 of its iOS mobile operating system. This required iPhone users to give explicit consent for user-level and device ID-based monitoring by apps. Not surprisingly, users declined in droves. And the impact for Facebook has now become clear – in the form of $10bn in lost advertising revenue. That’s 8.5% of the company’s 2021 revenues, but, more significantly, a quarter of its overall profit for the year. It’s easy to see why results like these might lead investors to reconsider their stock portfolios. But Facebook has had wobbles before and recovered. As a company, it has vast resources of cash and talent. Given time, it might be able to find a way of luring young adults away from TikTok and of navigating round Apple’s ATT. But for anyone who takes a longer-term view of these difficulties, the big story is that the company’s user base may have stopped growing. The figures revealed last week show that the number of daily active users fell by 500,000 and that the numbers of monthly active users seems to have levelled off at 2.91 billion. If this is the beginning of a trend, it’s really significant. Why? Basically it’s all about network effects. Way back in 1990, Bob Metcalfe, the co-inventor of Ethernet, formulated a “law” that says the value of a communications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system. This law has driven every networking system on the planet and harnessing it has always been the goal of company founders. The trick was to attract users quickly (by not charging for services) and to get to the point where user numbers are big enough to make it very difficult to break into the market. Facebook reached that point long ago and if you want a measure of its power at the moment, try working out what the square of 2.91bn is. The reason the network effect is so powerful is that as long as the number of users is increasing, the company is riding a virtuous circle. The more users it has, the greater the incentive for new users to sign up. From the beginning, driving growth in the number of users has been Zuckerberg’s overriding obsession. It’s why he has always turned a tin ear to the voices of caution when the company ran into scandals and charges of causing societal damage. But network effects work both ways. If user numbers start to decline, then the virtuous circle suddenly turns vicious, leading to a downward spiral. Maybe this is what TikTok is already doing to Facebook’s Instagram, for example. Zuckerberg is smart enough to know his position as master of the current universe may be transitory. Sic transit gloria and all that. Which may explain why he plans to be master of the coming metaverse.

2/6/2022,"After chatting on WhatsApp about the latest series of Ozark, Paula Leonard’s* daughter broached a difficult topic: she needed two bills paid, as she was locked out of her online bank account after getting a new phone. Leonard immediately moved to help her US-based daughter as she has done in the past.  “There was this chit-chat and a lot of use of the word mum,” she says. “I think that was so clever because you have a Pavlovian response to ‘mum’ from your children. That gets you.” Over the next hour she arranged two bank transfers to the same account – one for £1,523 and another for £1,345. It was when there was a request for a third sum of £1,276, and a claim that bailiffs were threatening action, that Leonard, 75, realised there may be a problem. “While I was texting her, I emailed her and got a message back to say ‘That isn’t me mum, it must be a scam.’” It was then that she phoned the bank. Leonard is a victim of the latest form of fraud to balloon online, in which people are contacted by fraudsters claiming to be members of their family, who say they have lost their mobile and also access to online banking to pay bills. Lloyds Bank says the number of cases reported by customers soared by the end of last year, with victims losing an average of £1,950 each. When Leonard tried to ring the number during the scam, there was a crackling line, then a text message arrived saying “I think my mic is broken”. When she did not respond to the final demand, the criminals continued with “Mum?” and “Is it done?”. Then Leonard received texts from another number, with a photograph of a woman, saying: “I’m really sorry that my son Joshua has done this to you, and I’ll do what I can to get the money back.” She regarded this as an attempt by the fraudsters to reopen communication. Impersonating family members is a new tactic by criminals to undermine people’s mental safeguards against being defrauded, says Jake Moore, a cyber-security advisor at internet security firm ESET. “These scammers are well aware that if you can add the psychological element into a scam, they work far better than the previously used phishing emails thrown out as a net, where maybe they would see 3% to 4% of a return,” he says. “When you are being called mum or dad, that is what many people would have in their phonebook. Preying on the heartstrings by saying they have lost their phone – it fits in with what is very likely.” Moore says that it is easy for criminals to obtain a database of names, phone numbers and dates of birth through the dark web and social media channels. Charlie Shakeshaft, founder of Individual Protection Solutions, which aims to warn against scams, says fraudsters trade information on potential victims, including so-called “sucker lists” of people who have fallen for these crimes before. From there, the criminals can identify age groups of people who may have children of university age and who, for example, might ask for money. Typically, the conversation on WhatsApp, or via text message, is started by an automated bot, and then forwarded to a human who can communicate with the victim if they engage, says Moore. “Some can take weeks because they believe that, if they can really dupe those people, it might be worth it,” he says. This method is particularly sinister, says Shakeshaft. “People’s natural instinct is to worry about their child and to prey on that, in order to steal money from a victim, is pure evil.” Leonard says that the loss of almost £3,000 hurts financially, but is also infuriating for someone who considers herself self-sufficient and aware of threats. “It has hit my confidence and my pride,” she adds. She says that her banking app has a warning when transferring money to be aware of scams, but she continued with the payment as the request for cash was similar to what her daughter had asked for in the past. Nationwide, where she holds her account, told Cash that it would be giving a full refund “given the individual circumstances of the case”. It says that since there were warnings on the app, the building society had fulfilled its obligations under the contingent reimbursement model (CRM), a code of practice designed to give victims fairer and more consistent redress. “When making a decision to refund, we take into account a range of factors, including whether it was reasonable to believe the situation the member found themselves in. “In this case, her daughter lives abroad and is in the process of moving back home. Her daughter has previously received money from her mother. Therefore, a request like this was not unusual.” WhatsApp says that the company launched a campaign last year entitled “Stop. Think. Call”, encouraging people to pause and consider whether unusual, or urgent, requests for money, appear strange and to call a person before transferring any funds. “We have designed WhatsApp to protect people from unwanted contact, which is why, whenever you get a message from someone who isn’t in your contacts, we ask if you want to block or report them. We then review reports for abuse, and if we find an account has breached our terms of service, we will ban it,” it says. “We use a combination of techniques to enforce our policies and prevent abuse, including machine learning techniques to tackle fake accounts and fraudulent activity, and we assist law enforcement with their investigations in response to valid legal requests.” The company advises people who receive a suspicious message to ask for a voice note to verify that someone really is who they say they are. Lloyds warns people to be wary of any number that is not already in their contacts, and to try the original stored number of the person who is apparently making contact. HSBC, Britain’s largest bank, has also highlighted the growing number of victims of the fraud. “WhatsApp is typically the platform we are seeing this happen on, more often than not,” says the bank. The Lending Standards Board (LSB), which oversees the CRM, says organisations have to work together. “Other sectors need to come together with financial services providers and understand where the danger spots lie within the customer journey, so that each organisation can take responsibility for intervention at the right point,” said chief executive Emma Lovell. * Name has been changed",Lifestyle/Money,"Please, Mum!

2/6/2022,"Like a serially unfaithful husband pleading with his much-betrayed wife for one last chance – a speech he’s had plenty of practice at – Boris Johnson is telling anyone prepared to listen that he can change. Don’t kick me out of the house, so he begs Tory MPs with their fingers on the trigger of a confidence vote, I will prove to you that I can be a different man. He did the same after the release of Sue Gray’s heavily circumscribed, and yet still highly damning, preliminary report about the orgy of lockdown-busting booze-ups at Number 10. Unable to quarrel with her conclusion that there were “failures of leadership and judgment”, the prime minister told the Commons: “I get it and I will fix it.” No, he doesn’t. No, he won’t. Even if this sly old leopard sincerely wanted to change his spots, he is incapable of it. The Conservative MPs who are invited to meetings with him hear faux-earnest pledges that he will pay more attention to their views in future and assemble a more professional team at Number 10. Only the hopelessly credulous will believe this.  He is 57. People of that vintage rarely change. When they do, it is only because they possess the exceptionally high level of personal discipline required for someone to transform their essential nature at a mature age. One of the things we know about Mr Johnson is that he doesn’t do discipline. His recklessness, his deceitfulness, his entitled attitude that rules never apply to him and his unwillingness to face the consequences of his own actions are why this scandal happened. It’s because he can’t change and refused to even try to change when he moved into Number 10 that his premiership is self-imperilled. One of the notable things about his personality is how very little it has altered over the years. The twentysomething tyro journalist who was sacked from the Times for confecting a quote and mendaciously attributing it to his historian godfather is completely recognisable as the man of many years later who issued a stream of false denials about partying in Downing Street. He won’t change. It is much more likely that he will stay the same, but even more so. If he somehow survives this scandal and clings on as prime minister, he will almost certainly become an even worse iteration of himself. Witness his desperate attempt to smear Sir Keir Starmer with the false claim that, in his previous role as director of public prosecutions, the Labour leader was personally responsible for the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile. It was grotesque at every level, this Trumpian attempt to associate the leader of the opposition with Britain’s most rapacious paedophile. It was a lie and so demonstrably untrue that even the cautious BBC labelled it “false”. Not only was it shameful, it was also extremely stupid, because the net result was not to strengthen Mr Johnson’s grip on the premiership, but to make it more precarious. Quite a lot of Conservative MPs, including ones as yet undecided about what to do about him, recoiled in disgust. It so appalled the head of his policy unit that she tried to persuade him to issue a full retraction and apology. When he refused, Munira Mirza resigned. Hers was much the most significant of the cascade of departures from Number 10 over recent days. While the other advisers had only been members of his inner circle for a relatively short time before they were spat out, Ms Mirza was one of the Johnson long marchers. She was with him at City Hall and has been at his side for 14 years. He once said that she was one of the five women he most admires, a list that also included Boudicca and his grandmother. I shudder to think what Ms Mirza has seen during her many years aboard the Johnson rollercoaster. Anyone who has been with him that long must have a lead-lined stomach. She was even prepared to defend him when he likened women wearing burqas to “bank robbers” and “letter boxes”. For her, the “scurrilous accusation” about the Labour leader was something so sick-making that she couldn’t take any more. In an excoriating resignation letter, she lambasted him for “an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse”. She was surely writing more in vain hope than serious expectation when she told him that it was “not too late” for him to say sorry “for a grave error of judgment”. Ms Mirza knows him better than almost anyone else and she knows he cannot change. It is essential to remember this whenever you hear Mr Johnson suggest that he can relaunch his premiership by building a refreshed regime at Number 10. After the mass exodus of his most senior aides, received wisdom at Westminster is that he will struggle to attract quality people to fill the vacancies. Would you sign up to work for a prime minister who might very well not be there in three months – or even three weeks? Would you want to put your career in the hands of an infamously capricious boss and the feverish calculations of Tory MPs debating whether or not to try to evict him? In a ruse to try to make himself sound serious about doing things differently, Mr Johnson says he want to create an Office of the Prime Minister, an institution all his predecessors managed to do without. A new brass plate won’t remove the fundamental source of the dysfunctionality in Downing Street because he is the fundamental source. From the lethal mishandling of many aspects of the pandemic to Wallpapergate and much else besides, all the scandals and follies that have been spawned in Number 10 during his time there have one common denominator: him. Whitehall understands this. Senior civil servants who have been tipped as potential permanent secretaries for the new Office of the Prime Minister have told colleagues that they have absolutely no interest in working in proximity to the lord of misrule at Number 10. It was announced last night that Steve Barclay will move from the Cabinet Office to become the new chief of staff and Guto Harri, an adviser to Mr Johnson when he was mayor of London, is the new director of communications. They may have persuaded themselves that they have what it takes to make him a better prime minister. All one can say to them is that many others have deluded themselves that they could change Mr Johnson – wives, girlfriends, editors, party leaders, civil servants, colleagues, staffers. Their invariable fate has been miserable failure. Remember the parable of Allegra Stratton. A successful journalist and then a well-regarded aide to the chancellor, she was lured on to team Johnson with the ego-seducing promise of a significant, influential and glamorous role as his chief spokeswoman. He told her she would find him an eager audience for her advice. The job offer then dematerialised when the prime minister changed his mind and she was shunted into a lesser function for a while before quitting in tears when she was exposed joking about a Christmas party she did not even attend. Consider the moral of Dominic Cummings. Thinking himself both more clever and more ruthless than Mr Johnson, he thought he had the guile, the ideas and the energy to control the prime minister and rule in his name from behind the throne. He ended up being ejected from Number 10 carrying a box of his belongings. Ponder on the fate of Dan Rosenfield. He became chief of staff at Number 10 in January 2021 when the prime minister was blaming his previous bunch of aides for the anarchy in the building. Mr Rosenfield arrived with glowing commendations from people who had worked with him. He was a superb operator, they said, with a record of getting things done both at the Treasury and in business. Tory MPs and cabinet ministers were assured that Dan was the man to fix Downing Street. Instead, he has become yet another figure who strayed into the chaos field generated by Mr Johnson and was then consumed by it. Barely more than a year after he took up the post, Mr Rosenfield has tendered his resignation. He, Mr Cummings and Ms Stratton are very different characters. All made the terrible mistake of thinking they were strong enough to cure Mr Johnson of his weaknesses. On Friday, the prime minister gave a talk to his remaining staff in which he quoted a character from The Lion King: “Change is good.” There’s only one change to the personnel at Number 10 that would do some real good.

2/6/2022,"Boris Johnson’s book, Shakespeare: The Riddle of Genius, is now so late it’s embarrassing to mention it. But in the meantime, Shakespeare himself seems to have taken up residence as Whitehall’s writer-in-chief. As so often in times of political upheaval, it’s to Shakespeare’s grasp of motive and policy, and human quirks and struggles, that we turn. Johnson’s current travails, like arguments around the English civil war, the battle for women’s suffrage, and Bush’s response to 9/11, are revealingly reframed by Shakespearean parallels. The PM has recently compared himself to Othello, nominating Dominic Cummings as his Iago. It’s an allusion that cannot turn out well – even in a Lulu Lytle bedchamber. Cummings himself has suggested Johnson is a shambolic Prospero, avoiding his political duties including chairing the Cobra committee, sequestering himself instead with his books. Perhaps Prospero was, indeed, exiled to his magical island after 54 letters of no confidence in his dukedom.  Elsewhere, it’s Macbeth that provides the script for a misogynistic story in which the leader’s strong-minded wife pulls the strings. Carrie has some work to do on her ambition, though: Shakespeare’s heroine at least has the king and national domination in her sights, rather than some overweening spads and international pet rescue. As No 10 empties, Johnson, a man who seems more at home in the convivial oblivion of sociability – the world of comedy, as well as of parties – wears the aspect of isolation and abandonment. He is a Macbeth holed up in his castle, a Coriolanus deserted by his allies. A politician who likened himself to Brutus during his own long leadership campaign has, like Caesar’s assassin, now seen fortune’s wheel spin away from him. The PM’s Friday “pep talk” to his remaining staff drew not on Shakespeare directly, but on a Hamlet spin-off, Disney’s The Lion King. Quoting Rafiki, a version of the play’s good-natured but ineffectual buddy Horatio, Johnson observed “change is good, and change is necessary, even when it’s tough”. It’s not quite the swan of Avon. Many more apposite quotations present themselves. Perhaps, from The Tempest, “Canst thou bring me to the party?”, or the reassurance in Titus Andronicus that “the ambush of our friends be strong”. Or even, in response to Sue Gray’s report, “Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?” (Twelfth Night). There’s plenty more Shakespearean advice for any political leader on the ropes, from Henry V’s war with France diverting attention from domestic woes, to Richard III flanked by Catholic bishops and holding a Bible in a performance of piety (surely we must be due a christening?). Johnson is certainly no Othello: that soldier of firm principle, dignity and fatal uxoriousness is a distant comparison. Nothing would get Othello on to a zip wire, and his take on “watermelon smiles” would be worth hearing. An indulgent Shakespearean analogy might rather cast Johnson as Falstaff, the cheerful, carnal and pragmatic companion to the young Prince Hal in the two parts of Henry IV. Falstaff might well – if he could be bothered – have written two columns advocating opposite views. He might well have refused to divulge the number of his children. He would certainly cadge off wealthier friends. Johnson’s repetition at a press conference of the myth that The Merry Wives of Windsor was commissioned by a Queen Elizabeth in love with Falstaff doesn’t augur well for his book’s accuracy, but does tell us something about his identification with this degenerate. In Windsor, Falstaff tries to present himself as a ladies’ man. The wives are immune to his perjured romance, and instead of getting his end away, he is thrown out in a basket of soiled laundry. Comparisons between the braggart PM and Falstaff are commonplace. But few trace that character arc as Shakespeare himself does. Over the course of his Falstaffiad, Shakespeare makes clear that beneath the buffoon lies something disturbingly venal. His bonhomie is only skin deep. Turning his relationships into transactions – a loan here, a kickback there – he is loyal only to himself. Falstaff’s ultimate degradation is his casual willingness to send his men “poor and bare” into battle, in the second part of Henry IV. His bleak dismissal of them as “food for powder. They’ll fill a pit as well as better” echoes the equivalent: “Let the bodies pile high.” Shakespeare reveals Falstaff to be a dangerous, narcissistic populist. Let’s hope Johnson is researching that for his book.

2/6/2022,"In Mission, Texas, on the border between the US and Mexico, sits the National Butterfly Center. A 100-acre nature preserve once exclusively dedicated to the conservation of plants and wildlife, it has now been thrust into the national spotlight and become a focal point of divisions over the country’s immigration policy. This week, the butterfly center was forced to close its doors indefinitely amid ongoing threats from far-right conspiracists and QAnon followers who falsely claim it is a haven for human-trafficking and illegal migration.  “They’re not conspiracies, they’re just outright lies,” Marianna Treviño-Wright, the executive director of the National Butterfly Center, told the Guardian. “I think that’s a very important point that needs to be made. As long as they’re called ‘conspiracies’, then it seems like there’s some plausibility.” The North American Butterfly Association (NABA), which runs the center, decided to close it down indefinitely on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, after being warned to “be armed at all times or out of town” during a We Stand America rally in support of a border wall. The butterfly center first attracted the attention of the far right in 2017. Treviño-Wright and the NABA made headlines for suing the organizations behind the construction of a section of Donald Trump’s border wall after they sought to build straight through the butterfly preserve. Those groups included We Build the Wall, led by Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon and founder Brian Kolfage, which is now facing corruption and fraud charges. Conspiracy theories about the butterfly center snowballed after Kolfage posted a series of tweets, claiming it was run by “left wing thugs with a sham butterfly agenda” and asserting without evidence that “rampant sex trade” was taking place on the property. Treviño-Wright said an increase in online and in-person harassment soon followed. A court date for the case about the section of border wall on the center’s property has not been set yet. Treviño-Wright said since the lawsuit she has faced personal threats and on one occasion, assault, by the extremist Virginia Republican congressional candidate Kimberly Lowe who visited the butterfly center last month and demanded to see “‘illegals crossing on rafts”. In an audio recording of the visit, Lowe is heard claiming baselessly that Treviño-Wright was “OK with children being sex-trafficked, raped and murdered”. “It’s utterly ridiculous that instead of Democrats and a pizza joint, it’s immigrants and a butterfly center,” Treviño-Wright said, comparing the situation to the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy that took off in 2016 in an attempt to paint the then presidential candidate Hilary Clinton as a proponent of human trafficking. The butterfly center’s closure this week did not come as a surprise to Treviño-Wright. “This has been escalating. Not just the attacks on us, but the agenda in the political landscape. I think it makes sense for the [NABA] board to pump the brakes. If this madness is going to continue until the midterms or, God forbid, beyond that, we need to have personnel and a plan in place to protect ourselves as best as possible to be prepared for this horrible situation.” Treviño-Wright said the construction of sections of the border wall, and the subsequent vitriol that came from QAnon followers and Trump supporters, had a profound effect on the butterfly center and its staff. “When you’re targeted by laws that are designed to be destructive, it’s very difficult to continue operations as normal. So it’s been disruptive. It’s been destructive. And it’s made it very difficult for us to focus on our mission, which is environmental conservation and education.” Choking back tears, Treviño-Wright explained the events of recent years had put a strain on her mental health and personal relationships. “It really has made me a misanthrope. I used to believe much better of people, but now I’m afraid to even go to the grocery store because I can’t trust that the person with the cart next to me doesn’t believe” the lies, Treviño-Wright said. On her accidental venture into political activism, Treviño-Wright called herself: “Utterly reluctant, unwilling, and anxious-to-not-be-here-or-be-doing-this-any-more.” The butterfly center is now sharing strategies for dealing with confrontational conspiracists with the Children’s Museum of Denver, which was forcibly shut down after anti-maskers frequently directed their anger towards staff. Treviño-Wright said she didn’t know if her center would reopen, but “certainly hope[s] it does. “It’s a magical place and it’s a place I’ve poured the last 10 years of my life into developing and defending. I hope there’s a wonderful future in store for the National Butterfly Center, but as long as these people get away with these things, I’m not sure of anything. Not just for anything but for our entire country. “It’s just unbelievable that somehow things have reached this point in American history that a nature center stands at the crossroads of whether our country slides full-on into authoritarianism or our democratic republic survives.”",News/US news,‘I’m afraid’: Texas butterfly sanctuary forced to close after far-right threats,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/texas-butterfly-sanctuary-far-right-threats
