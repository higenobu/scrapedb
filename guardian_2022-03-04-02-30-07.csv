3/4/2022,"Some day there will be PhD theses written on the strange anomie of films shot during the pandemic, written so everything basically happens in one house using just a handful of actors. There have already been scads of low-budget horror films in this mode which have trickled out over the last few months, and some are quite interesting and inventive. This one, not so much. A good-looking young couple, Brad (Taye Diggs) and Jess (Jessica Uberuaga), have just bought a house somewhere in the hills above California’s San Fernando Valley. Seen often via drone footage, it is an oddly constructed abode that looks like a cross between geodesic dome and an egg incubator. Meanwhile, the camera spends a lot of time roaming the building’s corridors and empty rooms, like we’re watching an estate agent’s VR tour. That sort of fits given Brad and Jess are small-time developers who buy places like this in order to flip them for profit. In a way, this is a throwback to a whole cycle of films from a few years back in which upwardly mobile young people are punished by supernatural forces for their property greed. Presumably we are meant to feel that the characters here get what they deserve for this sin of acquisition. Their wrongdoing is compounded when they start using a book of incantations they find in a spare room that generates gold coins and creepy, pentacular arrangements of bric-a-brac, as if the house is haunted by a satanic fan of Joseph Beuys. Michael Madsen is also on hand as a previous owner who alludes ominously to his father’s fascination with the occult. Clearly, this will not go well. Eventually things get mildly scary and all those white walls, neutral furniture and plain beige flooring are smothered with lashings of blood. The dialogue is wooden, the performances stilted and it’s all just a bit too pro forma – until a truly upsetting flashback involving the younger Brad’s pet dog. Then the film turns a corner from dreary to repugnant.  The Incarnation is released on 7 March on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,The Incarnation review – property-greed horror in haunted-house location,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/the-incarnation-review-taye-diggs
3/4/2022,"Even seasoned professionals were horrified when they read the Ofsted report in which a brand new children’s home in Bolton shut down in January. Inspectors had discovered one child had been living in such “squalid” conditions that flies were hatching in his bedroom, which the boy had not left for four months. The obvious questions followed: how did the private provider, Achieve Care Homes Ltd, receive its licence from Ofsted in August 2021, only to have it taken away in January 2022? What due diligence was done on the owners to ensure they were fit and proper people to take care of some of society’s most vulnerable children? As the Guardian began investigating Achieve Care Homes, particularly its main director, the former pub landlord Robert McGuinness, 34, it became clear at least one red flag had been missed which could have questioned his suitability to run a company caring for vulnerable children. In September 2020, Ofsted inspected an independent school he was trying to open in Bolton and found it unsuitable on many fronts. The school, Stanley House, never officially opened, but is instead run to this day as an “alternative provision” (AP), along with a sister “training centre” in nearby Bury. Neither are registered with Ofsted and nor do they have to be, as they only provide part-time education for children in years 9 to 11 (aged 14 to 16) who have been excluded from mainstream education. This is something Ofsted is lobbying government to change. “We would like to see the current system urgently reviewed. We believe that all AP settings should be registered, regardless of how many hours they are open or how many children attend,” said a spokesperson. Currently, Ofsted only inspects individual buildings – children’s homes and schools –rather than private providers. This can make it difficult to join the dots when the same people open new premises using different companies. Between January 2014 and March 2022, McGuinness was a director of seven companies, all with similar names. All of his child-focused businesses cater for the most marginalised young people in society – those who have been taken away from their parents and into care or those excluded from mainstream education. Though these children are the most difficult to look after, they also offer a big money-making opportunity. Some private children’s home providers now charge £12,000 a week to care for children with the most complex needs. These, as in the Bolton home, may be children who need extremely close supervision by highly trained staff. Bernie Brown, director of children’s services for Bolton Council, wants a total rethink of the way children’s social care and educational settings are regulated. She said a key flaw, in her eyes, is that “Ofsted regulates buildings, not the providers. There’s no regulation of the providers”. She wants to know why Ofsted effectively stopped McGuinness from opening his private school in Bolton, and yet approved a children’s home by another of his companies within a year. On Tuesday, planning officers at Bolton council approved an application from Achieve Care Homes to turn a block of flats into eight studios for care leavers aged 16-18, plus a warden. There was no opportunity for Brown or any councillors to object: the building was not changing use and so was a “permitted development” to be given automatic approval. Achieve will not have to register with Ofsted, as the residents will all be at least 16 and not receiving care (thus not meeting the legal definition of a children’s home). The government recently announced a crackdown on unregulated provision, but Ofsted will only start inspecting them in 2023. An Ofsted spokesperson said: “We do everything that we can within the legislation and the resources that we have to ensure the suitability of a provider to register a children’s home. However, that legislation is focused on the roles of the registered manager and the person who supervises them. There are limits on the checks that we can apply to the business owners. And company structures can be very opaque and complex. For example, home managers undergo criminal record (DBS) checks – but business owners are not eligible for these checks. “For several years now we have consistently said that the Care Standards Act is not fit for purpose. There are many areas that need reform in order to respond to the needs of children and the reality of the world today. It is simply not good enough that the ownership of children’s homes has such limited oversight.” A lawyer for the Achieve Training Centre Community Interest Company said: “There is no reason why our client’s care division should be affected by our client’s education division, being different divisions of our client’s business.”",News/Society,How did Bolton children’s home receive Ofsted licence to close months later?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/how-did-bolton-childrens-home-receive-ofsted-licence-to-close-months-later
3/4/2022,"Nesrine Malik’s otherwise excellent analysis pays too little attention to the motivation behind Michael Gove’s demonisation of local engagement in school leadership (Muslims still bear the stigma of the ‘Trojan horse’ scandal. Maybe that’s what was intended, 28 February). Twenty years ago, I was working with a number of ethnic minority communities around England, supporting them in setting up supplementary schools to compensate for the often poor public schooling available to them after 18 years of Conservative government. In a Birmingham suburb with a significant majority of people of Bangladeshi origin, the local primary school had not a single Muslim governor. When asked, the headteacher claimed that “these parents are not interested in education – they don’t even come to parents’ evenings”. “When do you hold your parents’ meetings?” we asked. “In the evenings, of course.” We pointed out that the main occupation of many Bangladeshi men was in catering, and that many women would not leave their homes unescorted at night. We promised to demonstrate our point and packed the school hall for a social gathering, food and music included. By the end of the night, we had three new school governors. The seeds had been sown of a school that could understand and serve the needs of its community. Gove’s favouring of unaccountable academy chains, many sponsored by hedge fund investors and businessmen, is the real threat to the system of local community schools, answerable to the people who send their children to them – and pay for them.Nigel GannLichfield, Staffordshire  I write as someone who was a long-time governor at Golden Hillock school, renamed after the Trojan horse scandal. We now live in a different world from when the Sunday Times brought a Birmingham schools matter to public notice in 2014 with all the hype that followed, but there remains a degree of negative perception among parts of our population concerning Muslims and Islam. The Dreyfus affair in France, like Trojan horse, was based on a bogus letter. It appealed to strong antipathy among sections of society towards Jewish people. The racism was insufficiently addressed, and many years later Pierre Laval’s Vichy regime handed over French Jews to the Nazis. Can Ukraine remind us that the dignity, freedom and security of all British people is precious to us all and needs defending? Lessons such as inclusion and the impartial application of the rule of law that defends difference can be part of the lessons learned for the common good. It must be our highest aim.John RayHook, East Riding of Yorkshire  Nesrine Malik has missed the point about the Trojan horse concern in Birmingham. The issue was whether local authority schools could provide a wide education and give pupils a basic understanding of a multicultural society. We now have academies that can be set up by any religious organisation or individual. Those of us who had hope that a public education service would provide for a thoughtful society with a wide range of cultural communities have now lost it. We now have a publicly funded education system with schools that do not have to follow the national curriculum.

3/4/2022,"The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is hoping to show through public hearings in April how it believes Donald Trump came to violate federal laws in his efforts to overturn the 2020 US election results, the panel has indicated in court documents. The hearings are set to be a major and historical political event in America as the panel seeks to publicly show the extent of its investigations so far into the shocking events that saw a pro-Trump mob invade the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden by Congress. The panel alleged in a court filing on Wednesday that Trump and his associates obstructed Congress and conspired to defraud the United States on 6 January, arguing it meant the former Trump lawyer John Eastman could not shield thousands of emails from the inquiry. But the public hearings – which are likely to come late next month, the chair of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, told the Guardian – will address just how Trump came to interfere with the joint session of Congress through rhetoric he knew to be false or unlawful. “The president’s rhetoric persuaded thousands of Americans to travel to Washington for January 6, some of whom marched on the Capitol, breached security, and took other illegal actions. The select committee’s hearings will address those issues in detail,” the filing said. The panel also said in its court submission that the public hearings would address how Trump appeared to lay the groundwork for his rhetoric inciting the Capitol attack by promoting claims of election fraud in the 2020 election that he had been told were without merit. “Despite being repeatedly told his allegations of campaign fraud were false, the President continued to feature those same false allegations in ads seen by millions,” the filing said. “The select committee will address these issues in detail in hearings this year.” The select committee indicated the public hearings would serve as the opportunity to cast a light on Trump’s secret efforts to overturn the election, from his attempts to pressure the then vice-president, Mike Pence, to return him to office, to abuse of the justice department. “We want to paint a picture as clear as possible as to what occurred,” Thompson told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. “The public needs to know what to think. We just have to show clearly what happened on January 6.” Thompson said that the select committee has witnesses who have volunteered to testify before the panel in public hearings, though he did not specify whether they included former Trump administration officials or Capitol attack rioters who had been charged. The clues as to what the panel will address in the much-anticipated public hearings, which will precede an interim report of its findings, came in a filing in which the select committee said for the first time they believed Trump had engaged in criminal activity. The Guardian first broke the news earlier this year that the select committee was investigating whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy that connected the “political elements” of his scheme to return himself to office with the violence perpetrated by far-right militias. The fact that the panel said it had evidence of criminality does not mean House investigators will ultimately refer Trump to the justice department for prosecution. But its inclusion in the brief suggested the panel thinks it has sufficient materials to convince a judge.",News/US news,US Capitol attack committee plans April hearings to show how Trump broke law,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/us-capitol-attack-april-hearings-trump-broke-law
3/4/2022,"Boris Johnson has awarded a knighthood to Gavin Williamson, who was sacked as defence secretary for allegedly leaking secure information before presiding over a series of exams debacles as education secretary. The announcement was made by No 10 in a brief statement, which also said that Susan Williams, a Home Office minister in the Lords, has been made a member of the Privy Council. Despite his record in government, a knighthood for Williamson had been predicted by some, in part because of his loyalty to the prime minister. Williamson ran Johnson’s successful 2019 campaign to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader. Williamson, the MP for South Staffordshire since 2010, had served as chief whip under May, giving him significant insider knowledge of the operations of the parliamentary party. May promoted him to defence secretary in November 2017, where one of his most memorable moments in the job was suggesting Russia should “go away and shut up”. Just over a year later, May sacked Williamson, saying she had seen “compelling” evidence that he leaked information from a meeting of the national security council about the involvement of the Chinese telecoms firm Huawei in the UK’s 5G network. Williamson conceded he had talked to the media, but denied discussing the meeting. He was rewarded for his loyalty to Johnson by being made education secretary only two months later, but was derided by unions and opposition parties as the worst occupant of the role in recent memory. The nadir came when he oversaw the organisation of a new way to grade A-level students who had been denied exams during Covid in 2020. The eventual system, a mix of computer algorithm and teacher assessments, created obviously unfair marks, which Williamson initially defended, only to make a U-turn 48 hours later. He was sacked from the job amid a cabinet reshuffle in September, returning to the backbenches.",News/Politics,Gavin Williamson awarded knighthood by Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/03/gavin-williamson-awarded-knighthood-by-boris-johnson
3/4/2022,"Your article (Ministers’ loan plans could stop poorer students in England going to university, 22 February) notes that the plan requires grade 5 in GCSE maths and English to access a student loan, and poor children do worse at GCSE exams. The reforms would also prevent the 5%-6% of students with dyslexia who are likely to fail to achieve grade 5 in English, and the 5%-6% of dyscalculics who may not even achieve a pass grade in maths, from accessing student loans. It is well known that dyslexics can succeed at university, including Nobel prize-winning scientists such as Carol Greider and politicians such as Michael Heseltine. Successful dyscalculics are harder to identify, since the condition is not as widely recognised, but we have formally tested many who have done well at university, usually in arts subjects. The Equality Act (2010) states that individuals with disabilities are entitled to receive “reasonable adjustments” to support their difficulties. Will reasonable adjustments be made for these students so that they too can access student loans? And will provision be made for the appropriate diagnostic assessment?Prof Brian ButterworthUCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience  The government’s expected response to the Augar review of higher education gives me real concern about accessibility. Its proposal to set minimum entry requirements for students to be eligible for higher education loans will undoubtedly result in people from disadvantaged backgrounds being unable to progress to university and on to higher-level courses. It would be a travesty to go back to the elitist days when only the very wealthy could afford to go to university. Our society and economy needs a mix of higher-level skills, delivered by people from a diverse range of backgrounds. This is even more fundamental as we tackle the post-Covid, post-Brexit economic recovery – with skills being a central pillar of this. Widening participation is key to filling industry skills needs and supporting social mobility.

3/4/2022,"Roman Abramovich’s plan to use the sale of Chelsea to donate funds to victims of the war in Ukraine is not solely intended for Ukrainians, raising the prospect of money going to Russian soldiers or to their families. Abramovich confirmed on Wednesday that he wants to sell Chelsea and the Russian oligarch said that all net proceeds – understood to be the money from any sale minus legal fees – would be used “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”. The phrasing left open the possibility of the money not being entirely reserved for Ukrainians hurt, bereaved or otherwise affected by the Russian invasion of their country. The Guardian sought to clarify that statement by asking sources close to the process whether there is a chance that the charitable fund could be used to help Russian soldiers hurt in the war or to the families of Russian soldiers. A key figure explained that the fund is intended for all victims of the war and will not be connected to origin. Further details were not offered, with Abramovich’s team working with charitable groups to work out how best to proceed. It remains to be seen how much money from any sale of Chelsea will go into the fund. It is unclear how the net proceeds will be deducted from any transaction. Neither Chelsea nor Abramovich’s spokesperson responded to a question about the process regarding the net proceeds. Abramovich is said to want close to £4bn for Chelsea and has said that he will not call in the £1.5bn of loans he has given the club since buying them in 2003. Financial experts have predicted that interested parties are unlikely to want to pay more than £2bn. The situation at Chelsea has moved at dramatic speed. Abramovich has been under growing scrutiny since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and he has bowed to growing political pressure to call time on his ownership. The 55-year-old’s announcement that the club is for sale came after the latest call in parliament for him to face sanctions from the UK government.

3/4/2022,"Paul Nicholls is odds-on to win the British trainers’ title for the 13th time this season and the reigning champion paraded several interesting contenders for the Cheltenham Festival here on Thursday, but the extent to which British yards are currently struggling to match their Irish counterparts was also underlined a few minutes later, as Nicholls suggested that he will have “between 12 and 14 runners” during the four-day meeting later this month. Even 14 runners would represent Nicholls’s smallest Festival team since the fourth day was added in 2005, and he currently has just two entries– Bravemansgame and Stage Star – quoted at single-figure odds. Willie Mullins, by contrast, saddled at least a dozen runners on every day of the 2021 Festival, including 18 on the final afternoon alone, and will expect to return with similar number this year. Mullins also has eight likely favourites over the four afternoons, including Galopin Des Champs, who could run in either the Turners Novice Chase or the Brown Advisory Novice Chase and would be the most significant opponent for Nicholls’s Bravemansgame in the latter contest. “He’s a fantastic-looking horse and he’s done everything right,” Nicholls said of Bravemansgame on Thursday. “We got put in our place by Bob Olinger [in the Ballymore Novice Hurdle] last year [but] he’s improved enormously for a summer and I think he’s going to be even better next year when he’s stronger. “He’s four-from-four this year and he’s now rated 164, which is a high mark for a novice. He’s got class and he jumps and next year he’ll be a serious contender for the King George and Gold Cup. “No one knows what will turn up and run, but you can only beat what you’re up against. [Galopin Des Champs] has won his two impressively, he jumps and gallops, but until they meet, you’re never going to know. If he turns up, you’d be nervous, but we’re going into it with a really nice horse.” Nicholls will look instead towards the big meetings at Aintree and Ayr for some of his better horses, including Clan Des Obeaux and Hitman, who both landed Grade One races at Aintree last season. “There’s some nice horses to run [at the Festival] and that’s what you want,” he said. “We haven’t got the numbers, and never will have, that Willie and Gordon [Elliott] have got, but Bravemansgame and Stage Star [in the Ballymore Novice Hurdle], it’s really exciting to have horses like those to run, and for the future.” Overall, Nicholls feels that Ireland’s team is “not going to be far off” its record-breaking total of 23 wins from the Festival’s 28 races in 2021. “Things won’t change in a year or anything like that, they’ve got a huge squad and it could be 20 or 25, it is what it is, really,” he said. “We’ve got to do our best and the Irish will have huge numbers of runners, a lot more than we’re going to have this year, I’d say.

This is an unhelpful framing of the issue. Science and technology are tools that can be used for both good and bad ends. How we choose to use them is a matter for all of society, not just for scientists. Let’s remember that it was climate science that revealed to us (nearly 40 years ago) that our desire for plentiful energy and transportation based on fossil fuels would lead to catastrophe. And that it is low-carbon technologies that now offer us a pathway out of our climate predicament. More recently, it was biomedical science and technology that rendered Covid-19 less lethal for most of us, and allowed us to re-engage with friends and family.

3/4/2022,"As Russian forces invading Ukraine confront stronger and more effective resistance than the Kremlin probably anticipated, the big question is: what comes next. The Russian military has a history of meeting such resistance with serious violations of the laws of war, including deliberately targeting civilians and subjecting them to indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Between 2015 and 2016, Russian and Syrian bombing largely devastated opposition-held parts of eastern Aleppo, the country’s largest city by population. With the residents suffering under a punishing siege as well as indiscriminate attacks with cluster munitions and barrel bombs, incendiary weapons, and high explosive bombs, opposition forces ultimately surrendered. Russian forces repeated the same tactics later on, in Eastern Ghouta and Idlib, with equally devastating results. They deliberately bombed hospitals, markets, schools and apartment buildings, in some cases repeatedly. The aim was to make life so difficult for civilians that they would leave, isolating opposition forces and making it easier for Syrian ground troops to move in. Yet in Aleppo and Idlib, Russian forces operated mainly from the sky. With Russian ground forces engaged in Ukraine, perhaps the closest analogy to today’s situation was the second war in Chechnya between 1999 and 2000, when Russian forces utterly devastated the capital, Grozny, with an overwhelming display of indiscriminate firepower. In 2003, the United Nations reportedly called Grozny “the most destroyed city on Earth”. Russian forces also perpetrated several massacres, tortured and forcibly disappeared thousands, and engaged in other grave abuses in “mop-up” operations. Already there are signs that Russian forces in Ukraine are moving in a similarly indiscriminate direction, but these are early days. Russian forces in the east have used cluster munitions, which endanger civilians not only in their initial use, but also in the substantial unexploded ordnance that they leave behind. Although neither Russia nor Ukraine has joined the treaty banning cluster munitions, these attacks violate the prohibition of indiscriminate warfare, a longstanding part of customary international law codified in the Geneva conventions and their protocols, which both governments have ratified. In addition, firing ballistic missiles and rocket artillery, Russian forces are using explosive weapons with wide-area effects that are utterly inappropriate in populated areas. And they may be moving to encircle, and impose a siege, on the capital, Kyiv, and the second largest city, Kharkiv. Although sieges are a lawful tactic, they can set the stage for other serious abuse of civilians in the besieged area. So what can be done to stop a worsening spiral of indiscriminate warfare that would endanger countless Ukrainian civilians? Much has been made of how the many social media postings of attacks could serve as a deterrent by documenting and publicising any war crimes. But the attacks in Syria were also dutifully documented by video and disseminated on social media without sufficient effect. In the case of Idlib, international pressure did work to stop the targeted bombing of civilian structures. Military pressure from Turkish drone attacks on Syrian forces, diplomatic pressure from the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and the then German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and repeated denunciations from UN security council members succeeded in halting the Russian attacks in March 2020. They have, largely, not resumed. But the political stakes are higher in Ukraine, where Putin’s legacy is now at stake. And far more intense pressure has already been put on the Kremlin. The prospect of international prosecution for war crimes remains a potential moderating factor. Because Syria never joined the international criminal court (ICC), the court has not had jurisdiction over serious crimes committed there. The UN general assembly did establish a Geneva-based body to collect and preserve evidence of serious crimes. It has contributed to national prosecutions of Syrian officials, particularly in Germany, under the concept of universal jurisdiction. But even though Human Rights Watch traced command responsibility for the war crimes in Idlib all the way to Putin, no Russian official has been charged. It is not too late to start. More to the point, the ICC has jurisdiction over serious crimes committed in Ukraine under declarations filed by the Ukrainian government. Already the ICC prosecutor has announced an investigation, and 39 court members are backing him. The international community should now ensure that this investigation, and the court’s broader work, are fully resourced. Ultimately, the most powerful deterrent of atrocities by the Russian military may be the Russian people. Tens of thousands of Russians have taken to the streets in protest, despite a great likelihood of arrest. More than a million people have signed an anti-war petition, and various prominent people – artists, musicians, academics, writers – have signed open letters against the war. Emergency discussions on Ukraine at the UN general assembly and the UN human rights council are in the process of yielding global condemnation and the creation of a special mechanism to monitor, report on, and gather evidence of war crimes in Ukraine. These UN bodies should establish a similar mechanism for repression in Russia as well. By the same token, as the world’s governments impose targeted sanctions on people with complicity in the war and repression, they should avoid as much as possible harming ordinary Russians.

3/4/2022,"“I would like to address the speculation in media over the past few days in relation to my ownership of Chelsea FC. As I have stated before, I have always taken decisions with the Club’s best interest at heart. In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the Club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the Club, the fans, the employees, as well as the Club’s sponsors and partners.” Abramovich ushered in an unprecedented era of Chelsea success and changed the face of English football after buying the club in 2003. But after 19 years everything has come to an astonishingly speedy halt. There will be raised eyebrows at the notion that Abramovich has always taken decisions in the best interests of Chelsea. If that is the case why did he hastily announce an ill-conceived plan to transfer the stewardship and care of the Chelsea to trustees of the club’s charitable foundation less than 24 hours before the men’s team faced Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final last weekend? And why did confirmation that Abramovich wants to sell the club come 69 minutes before Chelsea faced Luton in the FA Cup on Wednesday night? Less than a month ago Abramovich was on the pitch at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, celebrating with the head coach, Thomas Tuchel, after seeing Chelsea become club world champions for the first time. Now he has bowed to political pressure to call time on his ownership of Chelsea. Abramovich says that he loves the club, but Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has made it all but impossible for him to stay in English football. Then again if the Russian oligarch is sanctioned by the UK government it is highly unlikely that he would be able to sell Chelsea. He would not be able to fund the club and the financial consequences could be dire. In that context a swift parting of the ways is in Chelsea’s best interests. “The sale of the Club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. This has never been about business nor money for me, but about pure passion for the game and Club.” Chelsea have spent heavily on brilliant players, recruited top managers and won every major honour available under Abramovich, who does have a strong affinity with the club and did not come into football to make money. He has yearned for Chelsea to be as entertaining as possible on the pitch, moved them to an excellent new training ground, built one of the best academies in the world and has invested in the women’s team. There has also been a focus on community initiatives and charitable causes, such as the club’s efforts to tackle antisemitism. Taken at face value, Abramovich’s decision to write off the £1.5bn of loans he has given Chelsea will increase his standing with supporters. However it is unclear what would happen if Chelsea were sold for less than £1.5bn. Critics of Abramovich will also dispute the idea that this has always been about passion for football. There have been calls in parliament for Abramovich to be sanctioned after the invasion of Ukraine and although he vehemently disputes allegations that he has links to Vladimir Putin and the Russian state or has done anything to merit being sanctioned, the political temperature has forced his hand. There has been little sign of Abramovich trying to cling on to control of the club. The Labour MP Chris Bryant has said that he fears that Abramovich’s decision to sell is an attempt to avoid sanctions. “Moreover, I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine. This includes providing critical funds towards the urgent and immediate needs of victims, as well as supporting the long-term work of recovery.” Abramovich has won praise from many Chelsea fans for this pledge. However there is no clarity over what the net proceeds will be once legal costs are factored into the sale. This element remains light on detail: what factors will detract from the net proceeds? How much will be left? And who will benefit from the proceeds? It is notable that Abramovich, who has not condemned Russia’s actions, said that the money would go to “all victims of the war”. The Guardian has established that it is not simply meant for Ukrainians. Your country of origin will not matter, raising the possibility of money going to Russian soldiers who are hurt in their war, to their families or to bereaved families. “Please know that this has been an incredibly difficult decision to make, and it pains me to part with the Club in this manner.” There is no doubt that Abramovich means this. As recently as last weekend Chelsea were maintaining that they were not for sale. Sources said that nothing about Chelsea’s leadership would change once Abramovich had transferred day-to-day running to the foundation’s trustees; he was still the owner. Political realities, though, have very quickly led to a different outcome. “However, I do believe this is in the best interest of the Club. I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person. It has been a privilege of a lifetime to be part of Chelsea FC and I am proud of all our joint achievements. Chelsea Football Club and its supporters will always be in my heart.” Abramovich, who holds Russian, Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, no longer resides in the UK and last attended a Chelsea home game in November. He would be gratefully received if he ever attended a game as a guest, but it is unlikely to be easy if sanctions are imposed on him.",Sport/Football,Abramovich’s Chelsea sale statement: his words under the microscope,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/roman-abramovich-chelsea-sale-statement-words-under-the-microscope
3/4/2022,"New figures showing the true cost of rebuilding houses built with defective blocks that “crumble like Weetabix” could end the “torture” for thousands of homeowners hit by the Mica building scandal in Ireland, campaigners have said. They have given a cautious welcome to a government commissioned report which they say more accurately reflects rebuilding costs. If adopted, as expected, by the government, it would significantly increase the €2.2bn (£1.8bn) compensation scheme unveiled last December. The housing minister ordered the independent report after his initial offer was heavily criticised because of the shortfall it would leave homeowners. “All we did was ask them to come up with a fair number,” said campaigner Paddy Diver, who claimed that behind closed doors, Ireland’s housing minister, Darragh O’Brien, had accepted the old scheme would be abandoned. “It’s not brilliant, the figures are right, but they are definitely workable for families,” said Diver. “The minister seems to be doing the right thing for the people here despite opposition from inside government. He is getting a lot of heat, but we just hope is a man of his word and accepts the new figures. He has said he would so we expect that,” said Diver. The initial scheme offered a sliding scale of compensation with €145 a sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft (93 sq metres) but a lower amount for anything above that. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland (SCSI) have now submitted straight rebuild costs after looking at eight types of homes hit by the scandal. It concluded costs would range from €150,000 for a two-bedroom estate house to €421,000 for a five-bedroom two-story rural home. But it warned in its report submitted to the government on Thursday that the SCSI costs did not include storage, septic tanks, boundary walls and fences or any outbuildings. An estimated 7,500 homes, mostly in Donegal and Mayo, have been identified in the mica scandal, which has seen walls inside and out of new build homes crumble to the touch. Last year Angela Ruddy, acting deputy principal of a school in Cardonagh on the Inishowen peninsula in Donegal, told the Guardian she was “absolutely disgusted” with the scheme unveiled in December, which she said would leave her with a bill €79,000.",News/World news,Irish homeowners hit by mica building scandal welcome report,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/irish-homeowners-hit-by-mica-building-scandal-welcome-report
3/4/2022,"The Scottish government has introduced long-awaited legislation to simplify how an individual changes their legal gender, which proposes dropping the need for medical and psychiatric reports, reducing the waiting time from two years to three months and allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to apply for the first time. Shona Robison, the social justice secretary, said the reforms were significant not only for transgender people but “in saying who we are as a nation”, as she made a Holyrood statement on Thursday afternoon to launch the bill. It is unusual for a statement to be made introducing legislation in the chamber, reflecting the tensions surrounding the plans, which have been fiercely contested within the governing Scottish National party and across the parliament. The gender recognition reform (Scotland) bill, first mooted in 2016, will introduce new criteria for applicants who wish to obtain a gender recognition certificate. Proponents of the reforms – whereby a trans person makes a statutory declaration confirming the sex in which they have been living for at least three months and their intention to do so for the rest of their life – hope they will streamline a process that transgender people find intrusive and distressing. Critics argue that the simplification – known as self-identification – will fundamentally alter who can access women-only services and complain that critical women’s groups have not been adequately consulted in the drafting of planned changes. Robison told MSPs that she was seeking to allay some of those concerns. “[The bill] does not introduce new rights or remove rights. It does not change public policy or prevent single-sex services being offered where appropriate. It does not change rules or conventions in place, and in place for years under the current system, for example access to toilets and changing rooms.” She said moving to certification based on personal declaration rather than medical diagnosis would bring Scotland into line with well‑established systems in Norway, Denmark and Ireland, and recent reforms in Switzerland and New Zealand. “The process will remain serious and substantial. Making a false application will be an offence with penalties of up to two years’ imprisonment or an unlimited fine,” Robison said. During notably moderate exchanges, members from across the chamber emphasised their desire for constructive and respectful debate as the bill is scrutinised. But Robison was challenged by a number of MSPs from all parties, in particular about the implications for access to women-only services. The SNP’s Ruth Maguire asked how the government would “ensure that single-sex spaces and services for the purposes of upholding identity and privacy, for example hospital wards, therapy groups, refuges and accommodation, are available to women and girls who need them and aren’t diminished?” Robison pointed out that trans people did not require a gender recognition certificate to access services that align with their gender, and that public bodies “have been managing these issues for many years”.",News/UK news,Scottish government introduces gender recognition reforms,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/scottish-government-introduces-gender-recognition-reforms
3/4/2022,"Ikea has temporarily closed all stores and factories across Russia in a move affecting 15,000 workers, becoming the latest in a swathe of western firms to halt operations in the country since it invaded Ukraine. The Swedish flatpack furniture company has mothballed its 17 outlets across Russia but said it would keep its Mega shopping centres open to allow access to essential retailers, such as food shops and pharmacies. Production at three manufacturing sites in Russia will be paused, and all imports and exports in and out of the country and its ally Belarus will be halted. Brand owner Inter Ikea and store owner Ingka Group said they had “secured employment and income stability” for the workers directly impacted by the decisions, including its 416 co-workers in Ukraine, where its one store and online operations have been suspended since the start of the invasion on 24 February. It was one of several firms announcing the suspension of activities in Russia on Thursday. M&S said it has suspended shipments to its Turkish franchisee’s business in Russia, which has 48 stores and 1,200 employees. The British retailer said: “We are building on our existing support for Unicef’s UK’s Ukraine appeal with a £1.5m package to support the UN Refugee Agency and Unicef to help children and families in need.” It also said it was sending £0.5m of coats and thermals to Ukraine, where it ceased operations at 10 stores a week ago. Volkswagen Group announced it had stopped production of vehicles in Russia until further notice, a decision affecting the Russian production sites in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod. Vehicle exports to Russia have also been stopped with immediate effect, it said. Diageo, which makes Smirnoff vodka and Guinness, said it had paused exports to Russia and Ukraine, while the Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company announced it had halted production at its factory in Kyiv and evacuated its employees. The London-listed company is one of the main bottlers for Coca-Cola worldwide and generated a fifth of its sales and operating profit from Russia and Ukraine last year. Online booking firm Expedia said it had stopped selling travel in and out of Russia, making it one of the first travel companies to announce such a move. Ikea has had a presence in Russia since 2000 and is understood to be one of its largest western employers. It made retail sales of €1.6bn (£1.3 bn) in Russia in the last financial year, which accounts for 4% of total retail sales. A spokesperson said: “The war has a huge human impact already. It is also resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions. For all of these reasons, the company groups have decided to temporarily pause Ikea operations in Russia.” Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began last week, there has been an exodus of western companies from Russia. They include some big names in fashion. On Wednesday, the British online retailers Boohoo and Asos announced they had suspended sales in the country, as did the Swedish clothing giant H&M. Boohoo said it halted sales immediately after the invasion began and has closed its Russian trading websites. The company said: “Sales made by the group into Russia are not material, totalling less than 0.1% of group revenues.” A spokesperson for Asos said it had “decided that it is neither practical nor right to continue to trade in Russia”. The country accounted for 4% of the group’s sales and contributed about £20m to profits last year. H&M currently has more than 150 stores in Russia, its 2020 annual report says, which will all be shuttered. Its shops in Ukraine have already been closed temporarily due to safety concerns. The Spanish fashion retailer Mango announced a temporary closure of its 120 shops in Russia and its online sales site there. Burberry said it had ceased shipments to the country, effectively shutting down its online operation there. The British luxury fashion brand has three stores in Russia, one of which is run by a franchisee and one in Moscow’s Red Square, and these currently remain open but they are not receiving new deliveries. Nike has said it is preventing Russian customers from buying online and Adidas has suspended its partnership with the Russian Football Union. Other brands to have taken action include Apple which is pausing sales and Meta, the owner of Facebook, which said it had stopped recommending content from Russian state media to all users of Facebook, with Instagram set to follow. Carmaker Ford said it had suspended its commercial van joint venture in Russia “until further notice”. And in the past few days, General Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Renault have all halted sales and operations in Russia. The Walt Disney Company, Sony and Warner Bros have said they are pausing their release of films in Russia while Netflix also announced it has no plans to distribute news, sport and entertainment channels from Russian state media.",News/Business,Ikea closes all stores and factories in Russia amid exodus of western firms,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/03/ikea-closes-all-stores-and-factories-in-russia-amid-exodus-of-western-firms

3/4/2022,"Alexei Trubetskoy knew he had to get out the moment he woke up and looked at his phone on the morning of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. “I got up, checked the news in disbelief and realized I had to leave as soon as I can,” he said. Trubetskoy, who runs an English language school in Moscow, bought a ticket to Sri Lanka on the same day. “It was clear to me that the horrible invasion will change Russia forever.” A growing number of Russians have decided to leave their country following Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, fearing the economic and political consequences the move will have. “I hope to return to the country I love, but it is completely unclear what will happen next. My future is taken away from me, the country won’t be the same,” Trubetskoy said. Russia has already seen a major crackdown on those opposing the invasion. More than 7,500 people have so far been detained at anti-war protests across the country, according to the independent monitoring site OVD-Info. A number of the country’s independent news outlets have also been forced to shut down. But those who leave are also fearful of the economic uncertainties that the country now faces: the Russian rouble and financial markets crashed this week after the West implemented crippling sanctions, and Moscow has also seen a mass exodus of western companies, including Ikea, Apple and Nike. Google analytics showed that the word “emigration” saw a spike in searches over the last week while countless Telegram channels have been set up in which worried Russians are discussing ways to leave the country. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said it was expected that the country would see an exodus of its “quality working force” who will sense there is “no future” for them in Russia. “This exodus will mean the degradation of the nation. The country doesn’t have a very large pool of talented people. Without them, Russia can’t develop itself,” Kolesnikov said The exodus has been fuelled by rumours that authorities could declare martial law as soon as Friday, when the federation council, Russia’s upper house of parliament, is due to hold a unscheduled meeting. Such a move would be unprecedented in modern Russian history and could involve mass mobilization of the male population as well as the closure of borders, according to an official document describing the law. “I got my family together after a friend at the ‘top’ called me about this martial law thing. We booked the first plane available on Tuesday and flew to a random country I have never been before,” said Anton, a senior manager at a major Russian oil and gas firm. “I am not planning to fight in this war that wasn’t my decision to begin with.” Tatyana Stanovaya, a prominent Russian political analyst and founder of R.Politik, on Wednesday evening tweeted that introducing a martial law could be a “logical scenario”. “The proclamation of martial law will allow the authorities to introduce military censorship, to increase the secrecy of the state’s activities and the actions of local bodies.” The last time the federation council called an unscheduled meeting was February 22, when the body approved Vladimir Putin’s request to use military force outside the country, two days before the invasion of Ukraine. The federation council said it will officially meet to discuss a package of anti-crisis measures in response to western sanctions. In a briefing with reporters on Thursday, the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, dismissed speculation about the introduction of martial law. A senior source working at one of the three major airports in Moscow also said he believed it was “unlikely” that the borders would close. “We haven’t been informed about anything. I think it is unlikely. At the same time we are in a war, so let’s see,” the source said. But as speculation mounted, a feverish mood was felt in Moscow on Thursday. Those seeking to leave faced a severe lack of available flights after western countries closed their airspace to Russian airlines. Moscow has also closed its airspace to much of the west in response. Flights to Yerevan, Istanbul and Belgrade were completely sold out for the coming days while a one-way ticket to Dubai was priced at over £3,000 ($4,006) – compared with £250 ($334) in ordinary times – according to the flight aggregator Skyscanner. Train tickets from St Petersburg to Helsinki were also sold out on Thursday and Friday. Some men who left earlier this week said they were extensively questioned at the Russian border. Andrei, a Moscow-based cinema director, said he was held at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport before boarding a flight to Baku. His luggage was searched, and an official went through his private chats on different messaging apps. “He took my phone and spent a good hour scrolling through everything. Luckily, I deleted all chats discussing my opposition to the war on Telegram and Signal,” Andrei said. “I was asked if I ‘truly’ loved my country and if I was against the war. He asked me why I wanted to ‘flee’ and why I was reading independent outlets like Meduza. “It was one of the scariest moments in my life,” said Andrei, who eventually was allowed to board his flight. Amid growing uncertainty, the head of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, urged her fellow Russians to stay calm. “We will definitely pull through this…Friends, let’s remember, a lot is dependent on us, we need to leave behind any disputes and just help our colleagues,” Nabiullina said in a rare public statement aired on Russian state television. Russia earlier this week also introduced new laws to stimulate the country’s IT sector. Many Russians working in tech will likely be eyeing to leave the country given that their skills will be valued abroad. But despite efforts by officials to convey a sense of stability, some at the very top of the Russian government have themselves evacuated their loved ones. “Our whole family flew to a country south of Russia earlier this week. We were advised to leave as soon as possible,” said the daughter of a top Russian official who has met Putin on multiple occasions. “We will weather the storm here.”",News/World news,‘My future is taken away from me’: Russians flee to escape consequences of Moscow’s war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/people-leaving-russia-ukraine-war
3/4/2022,"Australian officials prepared talking points to help the government respond to sensitive questions about Tony Abbott’s trip to Taiwan, dismissing any suggestion the former prime minister’s visit represented a policy shift. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia reveal the Australian government was drafting its responses to potential media questions at least a week and a half before news broke of the former prime minister’s travel to Taiwan. Abbott’s visit in October triggered a diplomatic protest from Beijing, after he raised fears that the Chinese government “could lash out disastrously very soon” amid increasing military pressure against the democratically governed island, which he also referred to as a country. Abbott told an international forum in Taipei the US and Australia could not stand idly by in the event of a military conflict over Taiwan, which China regards as its breakaway province that will one day be “reunited” with the mainland. At the time, the Chinese embassy in Canberra attacked Abbott personally as a “failed and pitiful politician” who had engaged in a “despicable and insane performance in Taiwan”. The Australian government has always maintained Abbott visited Taiwan in a private capacity, not as its representative. The documents obtained under FoI do not contradict that position, but they show the travel did not come as a surprise to the government, and officials clearly anticipated the diplomatic sensitivities. If the government was asked whether Australia had changed its policy regarding Taiwan, the planned response was: “No, this is a private visit that has no bearing on our policy settings. “Australia remains committed to our one-China policy. The Australian government does not take a position on Taiwan’s future status – that is a matter for the parties involved.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under Australia’s one-China policy, it does not recognise Taiwan as a country in the international system but pursues cooperation with the island in areas such as trade, culture and education. While Australia recognises the government of the People’s Republic of China as China’s sole legal government, Australia merely acknowledges the PRC’s position that Taiwan is its province. An assistant director in Dfat’s Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan Section sent an email to multiple Australian officials with the “media talking points” attached, 11 days before Abbott arrived in Taipei. While some of the names are redacted, the recipients included the representative at the Australian Office in Taipei, Jenny Bloomfield, and Australia’s ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher. A senior official at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was also included. The email on Friday 24 September also mentioned the office of the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the office of the trade minister, Dan Tehan. “For colleagues in [those offices], we note Mr Abbott’s visit is taking place in a quarantine bubble and so we will not be providing the support that we normally would for a former prime minister’s visit,” the email said. If asked “Why is Mr Abbott visiting Taiwan”, the approved response was to say he “has been invited to Taipei to deliver the keynote address at the annual Yushan Forum in Taipei, as a former prime minister”. The talking points included a line, “if required”, to make clear that Abbott “is not attending the forum in his role as Australia’s special trade envoy for India”. The document shows officials anticipated a potential question: “Given the sensitivities over Taiwan, won’t Mr Abbott’s visit cause damage to bilateral relations with China? / Has China raised objections about the visit?” The suggested response was: “Mr Abbott’s visit to Taiwan is in a private capacity. Australia maintains close and positive trade, economic and cultural ties with Taiwan, consistent with our one-China policy. “Unofficial visits and engagements between the people of our two economies help maintain and build these important economic and people-to-people links.” The talking points repeated the longstanding Australian government position that Taiwan’s future should be resolved peacefully without “the use or threat of force or coercion”. The partly-redacted documents also indicate Abbott was given a list of contacts, including the mobile number of Bloomfield from the Australian office in Taipei. Bloomfield was in attendance when Abbott met Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, during the visit. Abbott’s office confirmed to Guardian Australia that it had notified the Australian Office in Taipei of the planned travel prior to his departure, saying it was “a standard courtesy we extend to Australian posts overseas whenever Mr Abbott travels”. “In response the Office sent us a document detailing helpful information pertaining to such things as weather, electricity outlets, Taiwanese business hours, and emergency medical numbers,” a spokesperson for Abbott said. “It did not include any policy information, and was the extent to which Mr Abbott received any briefing from Dfat.” The spokesperson said Abbott had updated his entry on the Australian government’s foreign influence transparency register to include his attendance at the Yushan forum, but “the update is waiting to be published”. The talking points noted that another former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had “attended the Yushan Forum in 2020”. But in that case, Turnbull addressed the event by video link. Around the time of Abbott’s trip, both sides of Australian politics raised concerns about an increase in incursions by China’s military aircraft into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone. But the defence minister, Peter Dutton, attracted controversy a month after Abbott’s trip when the minister said it would be “inconceivable” that Australia would not join US-backed military action in the event Beijing sought to seize Taiwan. Comment was also sought from Dfat.",News/Australia news,"Government prepared for backlash before Tony Abbott’s Taiwan trip made public, FoI documents reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/government-prepared-for-backlash-before-tony-abbotts-taiwan-trip-made-public-foi-documents-reveal
3/4/2022,"After definitive series wins over India and England this summer – and a total of 29 wins from their last 30 ODIs – Australia head into the Women’s World Cup as overwhelming favourites. It’s a familiar position for this team, who have dominated world cricket for many years. But this particular tournament brings more pressure than usual, and Australia are desperate to regain the trophy after failing to make the final last time out in 2017. It does not take a wild imagination to envisage Meg Lanning hoisting the trophy in Christchurch on 3 April, but a loss to India in the third ODI of the series in September and a comprehensive defeat at the hands of New Zealand in a warm up match this week have exposed some rare weaknesses. The inability to take wickets – which was heavily exposed in the 2017 semi-final loss to India – was again a concern against the Black Ferns. Australia failed to defend a strong total of 321, taking only one wicket as Sophie Devine (161 not out) and Amelia Kerr (92 not out) chased down the total with ease and more than six overs to spare. Rival teams will have been taking notes on the way the Ferns were able to evade the bowling of the No 1-ranked ODI team. A World Cup is a different beast to a regular series; the tiniest slip up can spell the end of a team’s chances, as Australia know all too well after a shock defeat to India in the first round of the 2020 T20 World Cup brought them close to exiting the tournament at the semi-final stage. An almost miraculous break in the weather allowed that match to be played and Australia progressed to the final, which they won, but it was a close-run thing. The format of this tournament allows a little more leeway for those slip ups. Rather than being divided into two pools, the eight teams will all each play each other once, with the top four progressing to the semis. It meams there will be plenty of opportunities to make up for any early loss, though the Australians will be keen to avoid meeting hosts New Zealand at the semi-final stage. But the cloud that looms largest over the entire tournament is Covid-19. Already all-rounder Ash Gardner has tested positive and is required to isolate for 10 daysand she will miss the matches against England and Pakistan. All is being done to keep the players as safe as possible, but there remains the prospect that a swathe of positive tests could derail the Australians’ campaign. The depth of the Matthew Mott’s squad is enviable, but the loss of any one of the likes of Beth Mooney, Tahlia McGrath or Meg Lanning for a must-win game could see the trophy quickly fall from their grasp for another four years, even if the ICC has prepared for the eventuality of a Covid-impacted tournament. “If it becomes necessary, we would allow a team to field nine players as an exception for this environment and if they had female substitutes from within their management team, we would enable two substitutes to play, non-batting, non-bowling, but to enable a game to take place,” said ICC head of events Chris Tetley. It is an exception that would have been unthinkable in pre-pandemic times – a circumstance reserved for suburban park cricket and captains who spend their Fridays furiously texting everyone they know who has ever picked up a cricket bat to try to secure numbers for the next day’s game. For a national team to take the field with only nine players – in a World Cup no less – would have seemed as unlikely as international cricket being played in empty stadiums. However, the world has changed and the sight of media managers and physiotherapists fielding at long on and extra cover may not even be a novelty by the end of this tournament. As the first major tournament for women’s cricket since the pandemic took hold, there are more uncertainties than the teams are accustomed to.

3/4/2022,"Barrie Kosky has been repulsing, entertaining and thrilling audiences since he first appeared on the Australian live theatre scene with his distinctly European-infused Gilgul Theatre in the early 1990s. Characterised early on as the cliched enfant terrible, the Melbourne director’s work has matured over the years, but has never shied from pushing artistic boundaries and breaking rigid operatic rules. In doing so, Kosky has established a formidable reputation in Europe as the guy you get in to resurrect the stale corpses of the opera repertoire. As the Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed put it: “He has an unerring antenna for finding hidden pockets of silliness and tenderness, of humour and pathos, in works that have been performed to death.” The Golden Cockerel, performed in France in 2021 On 4 March Kosky’s production of Rimsky-Korsakov’s the Golden Cockerel – which premiered in France last year – opens at Adelaide festival, marking artistic directors Neil Armfield and Rachel Healy’s third Kosky opera, following the Magic Flute in 2017 and Saul in 2019. Here, Kosky discusses those productions, and others that have enthralled/appalled audiences and critics over the past decade. 2012’s the Magic Flute was a collaboration between Kosky, animator Paul Barritt and Suzanne Andrade, co-founder of British theatre company 1927. It marked Kosky’s debut as artistic director of the Komische Oper Berlin Kosky describes Mozart’s Magic Flute as a hybrid beast, and a minefield for directors. He also admits it’s one of his least favourite operas, and resisted calls by Komische Oper Berlin to mount a new production of the work for several years. But when he came across the work of animator Paul Barritt and the British theatre company 1927 at a Hanover festival, the director realised that a collaboration could deliver a Magic Flute free of all the usual operatic cliches. Kosky’s Magic Flute has played in more than 30 cities. Most of them loved it. Chicago did not The production marked Kosky’s debut as Intendant (artistic director) of the Komische Oper Berlin, and although he has staged a number of productions with them since, this work has proved one of his most popular. It has played in more than 30 cities, including Adelaide and Perth in 2019, and continues to tour; it has just finished a season in Houston, and will open in Montreal in a few months. Warsaw loves it so much that Opera Narodowa stages the Kosky production every year. “It’s success was an extraordinary shock and delight, but it came as a complete surprise to us,” he says. “People were just gobsmacked – a German audience being gobsmacked. They’ve seen hundreds of productions of the Magic Flute, they’re bored by the Magic Flute, so to get this very savvy opera audience to see the piece in a new way and not be bored by it …” While praised as highly original and visually stunning around the world, the fusion of live performance and animation – in which the Queen of the Night is portrayed as a giant predatory knife-hurling spider – appalled critics in Illinois last November, with the Chicago Tribune describing the Lyric Opera production as “visually chaotic” and “Monty Pythonesque”. The headline in the Chicago Classical Review? “Mozart for Dummies: Lyric Opera chops up, dumbs down Magic Flute in animated travesty”. In Kosky’s hands, Handel’s Saul became ‘a visually sumptuous full-scale choreographed opera’ Kosky took Handel’s three-hour biblical oratorio and turned it into a visually sumptuous full-scale choreographed opera for his Glyndebourne debut in 2015. “We wanted to liberate the story from a staid, static presentation,” says Kosky, who collaborated with Vienna-based designer Katrin Lea Tag. “The story itself – everything from the triumphant return of David with the head of Goliath, to absolute apocalyptic desolation of war, and the beheading of a mad king – the story lends to quite a broad spectrum of ideas and images. Saul was praised as ‘one of Glyndebourne’s finest shows of recent years’ “So we created a phantasmagoric world which was part 18th century, part contemporary. I wanted it to be sumptuous, we wanted to saturate the stage with a sumptuousness of silk and wigs.” The over-the-top production style was a gamble for Kosky, making his debut at the annual Sussex country house opera festival that has been running for almost a century. ‘The story lends to quite a broad spectrum of ideas and images,’ says Kosky. Christopher Purves pictured here playing Saul at Glyndebourne Opera House in 2015 The Guardian praised Saul as “theatrically and musically, one of Glyndebourne’s finest shows of recent years”. The Telegraph described it as “utterly enthralling”. “Three hours of sheer and utter nonsense,” is how Kosky describes his 2016 revival of Oscar Straus’s 1924 operetta, the Pearls of Cleopatra, for Komische Oper Berlin. “It’s the story of Cleopatra, but in our production she speaks with a Berlin accent and is anything but the Elizabeth Taylor cliche.” ‘I am deeply proud of her in this’: Dagmar Manzel in the Pearls of Cleopatra The director credits much of the production’s success to regular collaborator and stage designer Rufus Didwiszus, costume designer Victoria Behr, and the German actress who portrayed Cleopatra, Dagmar Manzel, a Kosky muse. “I am deeply proud of her in this, an all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza of sheer and utter nonsense,” he says. Kosky describes the Pearls of Cleopatra as ‘three hours of sheer and utter nonsense’ “It’s part Carry On film, part pantomime, part Las Vegas show and it requires the audience to just leave their thinking caps in the dressing room and sit back and watch three hours of nonsense. “And I think there’s a place for that in theatre. I don’t want to do that every night, and I certainly don’t do that in every production, but there is certainly a place for three hours where you can laugh and enjoy the outrageousness.” “So peculiar, it feels like a hallucination” was how the Financial Times described Kosky’s 2017 production of Modest Mussorgsky’s Der Jahrmarkt von Sorotschinzi (the Fair at Sorochyntsi), with reviewer Shirley Apthorp concluding the production delivered “musical beauty and dramatic incoherence”. Apthorp clearly felt ambivalent about Kosky’s Orwellian pigs on stilts and scatological acts against turkey carcasses; there were a significant number of vacated seats following interval at the Berlin premiere, she noted. ‘It feels like a hallucination’: The Fair at Sorochyntsi premiered in Berlin in 2017 Kosky describes the production as a labour of love, both for the music of Mussorgsky, whose alcoholism ensured he never finished the opera in his short lifetime, and the writings of 19th century Russian absurdist and grotesque novelist Nikolai Gogol, upon which the libretto is based. “There’s a wonderful combination of folklore, magic and a sort of eroticism at the heart of his stories,” he says. “Only in Gogol do you find this mixture of naivety and complexity – it’s a fairy story and a story of simple village life mixed in with magic and sex and melancholy. It’s a mixture I find very intoxicating on stage.” Kosky’s fascination with Gogol continued with the Covent Garden production of Dmitri Shostakovich’s the Nose, an absurdist Kafkaesque tale about a self-important civil servant who wakes up one day missing a body part. The 2016 English production, described by Opera Today as “virtuosic vaudeville”, debuted at the Sydney Opera House in 2018, with Australian audiences bemused by a series of unforgettable scenes: a bevy of bearded showgirls bearing aloft the protagonist, Platon Kuzmitch Kovalev, in nothing but his white Y-fronts, for instance; and a chorus line of giant tap-dancing proboscises. In Sydney, Kosky installed two plants in the audience who at one point jump up and holler, “This isn’t the Rooty Hill RSL, it’s the Sydney Opera House!”, before walking out in mock outrage. The Guardian critic Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore noted some real members of the audience followed suit, in a production she described as wild, grotesque and frenzied. ‘It demands strong visuals,’ says Kosky of the Nose, performed here at the Royal Opera House “Watching it I knew I was meant to be impressed,” she wrote. “But I couldn’t help but feel that this was Mr Bean done-up in the excessive costumes of The Capitol in The Hunger Games.” Kosky pondered long and hard about how to convince a live audience that a singer’s nose had vacated its owner’s face before going awol in the community. The solution: provide the entire cast with “normal” giant fake noses, thereby reducing the hapless Kovalev into a position of nose envy in the early scenes, before losing it to a clown’s nose after the appendage has absconded. That’s when the nightmarish circus begins. The Nose also played the Sydney Opera House in 2018 “Shostakovich wrote this opera when he was only 21, and the music, it’s like vaudeville on acid. It demands strong visuals.” The Salzburg festival production of the Jacques Offenbach operetta was Kosky’s last musical venture before Europe went into extended Covid-19 hibernation. It featured the stage designs of Rufus Didwiszus, who has collaborated on many of Kosky’s works, including the Golden Cockerel, which makes its Australian debut at Adelaide festival on Friday. Referring to the controversial decision to deck out Offenbach’s famous can-can dancers with Swarovski-studded penises and vaginas (fast forward to four minutes and 30 seconds to see them in action), Kosky says the remarkably seductive operetta simply demanded it. The LA Times called Kosky’s production of Orpheus ‘as deep as it is hilariously shallow’ “Swarovski was a major sponsor of the festival ... and there were hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Swarovski crystals on the stage. We were all very happy.” The LA Times’ Swed enjoyed it too: “The production is a dismaying, yet magnificent, overthrowing of the Offenbach typically presented as an innocuously charming wit who gave the world the light entertainment of operetta. Hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of Swarovski crystals were involved in the set of Orpheus in the Underworld “It’s a phenomenal show – as deep as it is hilariously shallow, brilliantly conceived and produced and performed.” In a follow-up piece, he wrote that the Australian director “dominated the European opera scene like no one else in memory”, building a reputation for delivering the sort of opera which – love it or hate it (or, not uncommonly, both) – people could not stop talking about.",Arts/Culture,"Crystal vaginas, giant noses and ‘vaudeville on acid’: Barrie Kosky on his most outrageous shows",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/04/crystal-vaginas-giant-noses-and-vaudeville-on-acid-barrie-kosky-on-his-most-outrageous-shows
3/4/2022,"Telecommunications issues are hampering flood rescues and recovery efforts in the New South Wales Northern Rivers region, with Ballina Shire Council mayor, Sharon Cadwallader, saying internet outages and patchy reception were the biggest issue for locals. Mobile internet coverage is almost nonexistent across large swathes of the Northern Rivers and phone reception is intermittent. Credit card payments are also unable to be processed, with most businesses only accepting cash. Some have been offering free food as a result, a welcome gesture in towns where supermarkets and shops have bare shelves due to cut off supply routes. In Mullumbimby, a queue stretched out of the Commonwealth Bank branch on Thursday morning as it opened for the first time since flooding earlier in the week. Tellers were manually recording customers bank account information and limiting cash withdrawals to $500. Communication issues have meant some families were unable to stay in contact with relatives who had evacuated, access news about road closures or contact insurance companies. Cadwallader has called on Telstra to set up a mobile phone tower in the region, saying the internet outage is shutting families off from friends and loved ones when they most need to talk. “We need a Telstra tower now, a mobile Telstra tower,” she said. “We’re starting to get pockets of power restored, but that [the mobile tower] is the most essential thing, because it’s hampering rescue efforts. And from a community perspective, kids that are holed up, they can’t play internet games, they can’t talk to their friends, their mums and dads can’t talk to their friends.” Tanya Phillips in Kingscliff said she hadn’t had phone service since Monday and internet since Tuesday. “We were really in a communication black hole,” Phillips said after having had to leave home to work in Tweed Heads where she has finally been able to get a signal. “It has been difficult. There’s been family worrying about us,” she said. Phillips said many people were calling the evacuation centre at Kingscliff to find out news, to check “if dad made it or if mum is there”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Telstra said most of its sites in Ballina were “still providing some mobile coverage”. It said it was otherwise making progress in restoring mobile and landline services across south-east Queensland and northern NSW. “We know this a difficult time and we are working to get everything back up and running as quickly as possible and as soon as it is safe to do so,” a spokesperson said. “We have technicians on the ground in areas we can access and we have more ready to go as soon as other areas open up.” “Many areas are however still inaccessible due to flood waters or are without power, including Ballina.” The spokesperson said temporary mobile facilities still required power and access to an area before they could be deployed. Acting chief executive of the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, Andrew Williams, said the group’s main concern is that communications outages, particularly mobile, could prohibit people making emergency calls when flood waters encroach. Williams said the mobile tower’s battery back up can only last for a certain period of time and if operators can’t get in to resupply generators with fuel, nothing can be done until flood waters recede. Williams believes telecommunications need to be listed as an essential service so that priority can be given to ensure telecommunications be restored as a matter of urgency, backup battery times increased, and priority access to fuel for emergency generators. The Regional Telecommunications Independent Review occurs every three years. The 2021 Regional Telecommunications Review report released on 14 February this year emphasised the effects of several natural disasters across the country and that “access to reliable telecommunications services has never before been more important to regional, rural and remote Australians.” The report noted that in the 2019-20 bushfires, the 2021 eastern Australia floods and Cyclone Seroja, and during the Covid-19 pandemic “regional Australians relied on mobile, landline and broadband networks for real-time information, access to emergency services, contact with loved ones, and resources to support post-disaster recovery”. For Phillips, who is the main administrator and editor of the community facebook group Kingscliff Happenings (Coojingburra), the lack of connection has made it difficult for her to provide the essential service messages to the community. “Things change so fast. We need to be putting things up on the site in real time because old news can be dangerous.” In order to post this week, Phillips said she would gather information from police at the evacuation centre, then borrow a phone with an Optus simcard to text another moderator on the other side of the river who still had internet. “Everybody was relying on whoever had an Optus phone. Optus seemed to be the only one working. If we could have flipped over and used Optus or Vodafone, services aren’t great but it would have been better,” Phillips said. Mark Gregory, a professor in telecommunications at RMIT said the current disaster was a perfect example of why the government needs to adopt the recommendation in the regional telecommunications review that they explore domestic roaming in emergency situations. “If an Optus tower fails, people in that area can use a Vodafone or Telstra tower so customers can still get access to the network, to call for help or be able to contact family and friends,” Gregory said. He said the government hasn’t yet responded to the report but that the recent flooding “provides strong grounds for the government to accept that recommendation and act on it.”",News/Australia news,‘Black hole’: telecommunications outage hampering flood rescues and recovery in northern NSW,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/black-hole-telecommunications-outage-hampering-flood-rescues-and-recovery-in-northern-nsw
3/4/2022,"The Morrison government should expand its $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover natural disasters – including catastrophic floods and bushfires – in other parts of the country, according to the scheme’s principal architect. The veteran Liberal MP Warren Entsch campaigned for the scheme for more than a decade before Scott Morrison ultimately agreed to implement a reinsurance pool for northern Australia, backed by a $10bn government guarantee, which aims to protect more than 500,000 properties. Entsch told Guardian Australia once the new arrangements were properly bedded down, the scheme should be expanded to other parts of the country given persistent extreme weather – like the current catastrophic flooding in Queensland and New South Wales – had rendered assets in other parts of the country uninsurable. Asked whether recent disasters, including the current floods, had made the case to apply the government guarantee more broadly, Entsch replied: “Of course ... If there is any incentive to get this started, what we’ve experienced in the past week makes it a no-brainer.” Legislation giving effect to the current proposal, which covers cyclones and related flood damage, has already passed the House of Representatives and is expected to clear the Senate during budget week in late March. The scheme is supposed to be operational by July. The reinsurance pool for cyclones and related flood damage will cover residential, strata and small business property insurance policies in northern Australia. Entsch, who holds the north Queensland electorate of Leichhardt, pursued the proposal because of constituent pressure. Insurance premiums in northern Queensland skyrocketed as cyclones and subsequent inundations became more frequent. The veteran Liberal says he has already made the case internally “on numerous occasions” that the scheme needs to be extended nationally to cover fires and floods. He said when he first started lobbying for the scheme back under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, he envisaged “some kind of catastrophe insurance, which would have covered a whole spectrum of events”. But he said he met implacable resistance, first under Labor, and then from his own colleagues. He said treasurers, including Joe Hockey, had argued there needed to be clear evidence of market failure to justify any government intervention. Entsch said the current scheme, once legislated, would be subject to a three-year review. He said he had lobbied Treasury ministers for an additional review at 12 months because “I’m not 100% sure we covered everything”. He said the expedited review created the opportunity to fix gaps or oversights, which then allowed for a proof of concept that could be applied to other disasters around the country. “What this does for us is create an opportunity of a scheme that’s going to work,” Entsch said. “I suspect the value of it is going to be significantly higher than the $10bn we have set aside, but I think it’s something we can start to apply more broadly, once we’ve got it right, to include floods, fires and other natural catastrophes.” Entsch said governments and planning authorities needed to remain focused on mitigation efforts, including not building on floodplains. But he said expanding the reinsurance pool was inevitable. “This is my baby and I want to make sure that it works.” The veteran Queensland Liberal appealed to colleagues across political parties to “put your political hats in the bottom drawer”. He said collaboration, rather than partisan point-scoring, would ultimately ensure the government extended the scheme. “Let’s work together and identify the flaws – and I expect there will be, this scheme is the first of its kind – and let’s fix them,” he said. “I will give an absolute commitment that I will use all of the skills and nous I’ve developed in dealing with insurance companies – which I still don’t trust. I will be more than happy to continue to lead the charge, once we’ve got it right, to expand the reinsurance pool to cover other natural disasters in other parts of the country. That’s a fair offer.” The cyclone reinsurance pool for northern Australia, backed by a $10bn government guarantee, ensures insurers won’t lose money if they offer insurance products in the ares covered. The commonwealth is effectively insuring the insurance companies against any huge losses if they offer disaster cover. The government expects the pool will reduce premiums by more than $1.5bn over 10 years. However, a report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recommended direct subsidies as a tool for bringing down premiums rather than the reinsurance pool the Coalition ultimately adopted. The commission in late 2020 found reinsurance pools supported the insurance industry rather than improved affordability. The Insurance Council of Australia backed the ACCC’s findings at the time but now supports the reinsurance pool.",News/Australia news,Liberal MP wants Coalition to expand $10bn scheme supporting insurers to cover all natural disasters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/liberal-mp-wants-coalition-to-expand-10bn-scheme-supporting-insurers-to-cover-all-natural-disasters
3/4/2022,"On my mental bookshelf, Robert Lukins’s debut novella, 2018’s The Everlasting Sunday, sits alongside volumes like Wallace Stegner’s Crossing to Safety, and Richard Yates’s The Easter Parade: novels of lavish melancholy and human grace. Thomas Savage’s The Power of the Dog is on that shelf, as is John Knowles’s A Separate Peace, and an obligatory copy of John Williams’s Stoner. Quiet classics. When The Everlasting Sunday arrived – a tale of outcast boys and a formative 1960s winter – it felt like the book had slipped through some fissure in the space-time continuum, less a new release than a rediscovery. Lukins’s new novel, Loveland, tears the fabric of time open for itself: the past reaches forward; the present reaches back. Reckonings collide. Stripped back to the barest of bare bones, Loveland has the kind of plot that Nicholas Sparks might filch: a thirtysomething woman, May, mired in a cruel marriage, inherits a house from her American grandmother, Casey – a property no one knew existed. May flees the cloying Brisbane heat for corn-fed Nebraska and the lake town of Loveland, once the site of an extravagant hotel and amusement park. A boarded-up boathouse is waiting for her, and the chance – perhaps – to start again. As May brings the house back to life, her grandmother’s story unfurls: a newlywed, far from home, caught up in a lakeside tragedy. It’s easy to imagine the gentle genre-romance version: benevolent water, sparkling light, a symbolic flock of waterbirds. Some obliging, soft souled, deft-handed handyman. And Casey’s sepia-toned memories of the view from the top of the ferris wheel. Twin tales of waterside sorrow and healing. But that’s not the novel Robert Lukins has written – his title is not a dainty promise, but a dark irony. In Lukins’s version of Loveland, the lake is contaminated, the boathouse is rotting, and May’s obliging handyman is a lock-picking teenage nihilist. The neighbours are years deep into a class-action lawsuit to salvage the value of their smelt-poisoned land; the town is prepping for a “mass casualty training session” at the local elementary school; and every time May’s phone pings it’s a new threat from her husband. In this septic pocket of the American midwest – this “vicious middleness” – Lukins gives us echoing tales of coercive control and erosion. Alone at the lake house in the late 1950s, Casey is learning her husband’s “rules”: his cast-iron marital expectations and lurking furies (“The word prisoner was never used, but it was how she came to understand herself”). Meanwhile, her granddaughter is realising that she has spent her marriage – her entire adulthood – in a state of isolated (and isolating) vigilance: anticipating, mollifying, deflecting, defusing, apologising. “There had been no severing incident,” Lukins writes. “It had all just been a creep. A slow, noiseless decay.” Decades apart, the two women seize on the same language of breathlessness: “the never-ending struggle for air”. Their unvoiced terrors burn up the oxygen. Lukins offers no excuses for the men, because there are no excuses. Nor does he try to nut out “why women stay”, because it’s not an unfathomable mystery – far from it. Loveland is a novel about how women stay: how they stay upright and functional and alive, and the price they pay for that perseverance – the hefty levies of silence and shame. These are inheritable costs, Lukins shows. “This was their lot,” May thinks to herself. “To work and go silent and eventually still … this was the chain and May was simply the next.” Like Lukins’s first novel, Loveland is a book of internal landscapes set loose. In The Everlasting Sunday, it was a world of frost – all brittle and numbed. A class full of snowed-in teenagers, waiting for their lives to thaw. In Loveland, it’s all fester, blight and ruin. The lake is “infected green and the smell of a wound”; sunset turns the sky livid, like “the back of a poisonous frog”. Ticks lurk in the bushes and burrow into scalps. Calves are gutted; books drowned. It sounds heavy-handed, and much of it is, but it’s also the wild, red imagery of rapture. And rather a novel of figurative violence than one of gratuitous infliction. As May finds her way around the local landmarks of rural Nebraska, she encounters tales of wronged lovers and grieving wives, of murders and massacres, of enough tears to fill riverbeds and waterfalls. A sun shower, she is told, “is the devil and his wife fighting” – a tormented, weeping sky. How might we imagine different stories for our children, Loveland asks, when women’s suffering is our folkloric bedrock, and inked into our maps? It’s a dignified question from a writer who so palpably cares about dignity; a writer who understands that it is not necessary to hurt women to prove how women are hurt.

3/4/2022,"The cows are found washed up on beaches, and in Lismore, they’re cutting holes in the roof to desperately clamour above the rising waters. In Sydney the rain won’t stop, while Perth baked in its hottest summer ever. Throughout the disorder comes the refrain: “When are we going to go back to having a normal summer?” In the summers we long for (sometimes nostalgically misremembered as bright and always perfect, warmly lit, always comfortable) the weather is hot (but not too hot) and life is lived outside. It is the season that we earn, sometimes live for, the reward for hard winters or wet springs, or just a tough year. They are our long, lovely golden days. In our distress about these lost summers, there is a sadness about what we’re missing, but also a fear about what has replaced them. Biblical rain (roads transformed into rivers, waterways brown, dirty and dangerous), the 2019 smoke haze that transformed the sky, causing asthma, anxiety and neonatal damage, the bushfires that killed or displaced 3 billion animals, new fast-moving Covid variants that isolated thousands over Christmas, the 2020 and 2021 snap lockdowns. Of course we want our normal summers back! The vast gap between our memory of perfect summers and the reality we are living through is so vast as to cause a sort of cognitive break. There are cows on the beaches. In order to live through this, we must think of it as a weird blip in the natural order. The alternative when contemplating these disordered summers is to let terrifying apocalyptic thinking slip in. If we are no longer living in a world that we recognise, that no longer provides the certainties that gave our lives a reassuring rhythm, the effect is destabilising. We feel untethered from the Earth itself and its psychologically satisfying seasonal rhythms. If for everything there is a season, what are these destructive summers for? Some ancient and superstitious instinct says they are the Earth itself retaliating after so much abuse, or a portent of a disordered world that is so far out of balance that it must initiate a cycle of creative destruction in order to restore homeostasis. In ancient Greece, Stoic philosophers believed the Earth would be periodically destroyed by fire (Ekpyrosis) in a ritual cleansing before starting again. Stoics usually believed this event occurred when civilisation was at its very height of sophistication and complexity (like ours is now). In an echo of the modern environmental movement, Stoics believed that when the intact and perfect balance of nature called Gaia was interfered with, then collapse was inevitable. Roman Stoic, playwright and political adviser Seneca believed Ekpyrosis would take the form of a flood. James Romm, in his excellent biography of Seneca, wrote of Seneca’s unease as Rome expanded beyond its territorial boundaries, “As in the biblical tale of the Tower of Babel, the very complexity of civilisation seemed to carry the seeds of its own destruction … Where once a single ship had disturbed the natural order, Rome had now filled the seas with traffic, scrambling the races and dissolving global boundaries. In Seneca’s view … the ceaseless advance of the empire would turn the cosmos itself into an enemy. When everyone could go everywhere, when no boundary remained intact, total collapse might not be far off.” This fear is an ancient impulse but now that it seems to be actually occurring, we are in deep denial. Signs of collapse are everywhere, but in our minds we think of this as an aberration – that next summer we’ll return to normal. The nostalgia for summers past is a trap. If we desperately wish to get back to the past, if we think it’s even possible to return, then we are deluded. The new reality is, in Donald Rumsfeld’s words, a known known. It’s been coming at us for some time, hundreds of thousands of reports predicting this disorder. The latest this week came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which said along with more extreme weather events, there was “very high confidence” that some natural systems had already experienced irreversible change. But for those of us in this age of collapse, trapped in a mental construct of what summer should look and feel like (not like this!), we are surprised and appalled when the predictions become reality. A denial of reality is baked into the rhetoric. This week the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, described the Lismore floods as a “one-in-1,000-year event”, as if it was a freak occurrence, a matter of timing, unlikely to happen again for another 1,000 years. There is a macabre comfort in this, that we will not live through this again – that is, until we realise these one-in-1000-year events keep happening, they keep piling up before our very eyes, daring us to wake up from our dreams and longings of normalcy. What more will it take? To look the climate crisis in the face, to see it for what it is, to stop believing this is a temporary aberration and that we will go back to those long, succulent, perfect summers, is to take the first steps in addressing the climate problem. Because there is a problem. The problem is both climate change itself but also our mindset: that the last few years are abnormal, that one day, hopefully soon, we will return to “normal” – and that golden seasonal rhythm we knew in the past will return unbroken. In an excellent long read in the New York Times on the deadly California fires, Elizabeth Weil tackled the magical and nostalgic thinking we have around the seasons. She writes the “climate crisis has caused us to get lost in time and space; we need to dig ourselves out of nostalgia and face the world as it exists. We’re living through a discontinuity. This is Steffen’s [Alex Steffen, a climate futurist] core point. ‘Discontinuity is a moment where the experience and expertise you’ve built up over time cease to work,’ he said. ‘It is extremely stressful, emotionally, to go through a process of understanding the world as we thought it was, is no longer there … There’s real grief and loss. There’s the shock that comes with recognizing that you are unprepared for what has already happened.’” In trying to return to a set point of normal, to get things back to the way they were before the summer bushfires, before the pandemic, before the floods, is preventing us from adapting and preventing ourselves from trying to solve the crisis of the world we are living in now. The past is gone. Those summers that we hold in our minds as a set point, a true north, are over. That time has finished, faded into myth and memory. This is how it is now – and we have to wake up.",Opinion/Opinion,"We cling to our memory of the perfect summer – before flood, fire and plague.

The Liberal senator Eric Abetz first raised the issue in August, describing what he said appeared to be “a desperate attempt at spamming for membership”, after he received an email falsely claiming he had applied to join the UAP. The Liberal senator Eric Abetz first raised the issue in August after he received an email falsely claiming he had applied to join UAP, saying it appeared to be “a desperate attempt at spamming for membership”. The UAP leader, MP Craig Kelly, said the email was the result of pranksters submitting other people’s details to the party, and claimed that a “couple of hundred” false applications had been weeded out by its checking process. But Guardian Australia has spoken to two recipients who received identical emails confirming UAP applications had been submitted in their name, which they say did not make it clear that they would be counted as a UAP member unless they objected. Both said their contact details were not publicly available. One is not even on the Australian electoral roll and is therefore not eligible to be a UAP member according to its constitution. Taylor Rundell, a Labor member in Grayndler, received his first email at 2.35am on Thursday stating his membership application “has been successfully submitted and is currently being processed”. “You will soon receive another email from us confirming your membership details,” it said. “If you have any questions or queries regarding your membership please email us at membership@unitedaustraliaparty.org.au.” When Rundell did not reply, he received a further email at 10.53am welcoming him to the party, thanking him for his “support for our party” and providing a membership number. “I’ve never filled out any forms on the UAP website,” Rundell told Guardian Australia. “My personal email address is not published anywhere … Although I do get a fair bit of general spam email. “I was worried [by the claim I am a member]. I have very strong Labor values … I wouldn’t want to end up on the list as one of Craig Kelly or Clive Palmer’s people. I have no interest in their politics at all.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Grant Turner, a resident of Casey in Victoria, also got the membership emails. Turner is a New Zealand citizen who has lived in Australia since he was two years old – but is not on the electoral roll as he is not an Australian citizen. “How they came to get my email I don’t know – it was really gobsmacking to me … I thought it was extremely odd,” Turner said. “There is not a chance in hell I’ve every corresponded with them or looked into being a member … it’s totally against my politics, and it’s definitely misleading to say I’m a member. It’s just rubbish.” In November the UAP claimed that it had 80,000 members – which would make it Australia’s largest political party – a claim repeated in Daily Telegraph and Saturday Paper reports.

Kelly defended the practice of opt-out membership, arguing it would be “unreasonable” to make people confirm their application again and “unwarranted, to catch a handful of bad actors”. “Not everyone responds to every email.” Kelly said the party does not use commercial lists of contact details to spam potential members or other automated processes. Asked who could have signed Rundell up at 2.30am, Kelly said he “wouldn’t be surprised” if rival political party operatives worked “that late in the morning”. The UAP also controversially claims former prime ministers Joseph Lyons, Robert Menzies and William Hughes as its own despite the trio having no link to the modern iteration of the UAP, which was registered in 2018.",News/Australia news,"Doubts raised about UAP’s 80,000 membership amid complaints over unsolicited emails",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/doubts-raised-about-uaps-80000-membership-amid-complaints-over-unsolicited-emails
3/4/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, made headlines earlier this week when he described the record-breaking rain that swamped the north of the state before moving south to Sydney as a “one-in-1,000-year event”. The mayor of Ballina shire council, Sharon Cadwallader, told the ABC that town was expecting a one-in-500-year flood before it was inundated on Wednesday. To the layperson, these descriptions might be interpreted as suggesting floods would only occur once in a millennium, or half a millennium. But this isn’t the case, and scientists say such phrases risk misleading the public about the likelihood of disasters of this magnitude being repeated. According to the premier’s office, it was drawn from a 2014 Lismore Floodplain Risk Management Plan that included data on the expected “average recurrence interval” for floods of different degrees of severity. There is no direct mention of a one-in-1,000-year flood level in the report, but it does set out the expected frequency of various flood peaks, as measured against a gauge at the city’s rowing club. The highest is 16 metres above sea level, which is the “probable maximum flood” level for a notional one-in-100,000-year flood. A one-in-500-year flood is set at 13.4 metres; a one-in-100 year flood at 12.4 metres; a one-in-10 year flood at 10.9 metres. What is known as “danger height” – the level at which local landholders are alerted – was set at less than half that – just 5.2 metres above sea level. This week’s flood in Lismore reached 14.4 metres, placing it somewhere in the vast gulf between the once-in-500-year and once-in-100,000 year markers – hence, the back-of-the-envelope description of it as a one-in-1,000-year event. Yes, but not what you might think. Describing a flood as a once-in-a-millennium event actually has a specific meaning. But it’s not, as many people might assume, that the planet won’t see another one until some time around the year 3000. When employed in a technical report, it means there is a 0.1% chance of a flood of that severity happening in a given location in any given year. (For a one-in-100-year flood it’s a 1% chance, for a 1-in-10 year flood it’s a 10% chance, and so on.) Dr Tom Mortlock, an adjunct fellow at Macquarie University and senior catastrophe analyst with reinsurance broker Aon, says when translated to lay use, describing the current flood as a one-in-1,000-year event is misleading. “It implies we would be waiting another 1,000 years before we see another flood of this magnitude again,” he said. “The fact we’ve had a one-in-1,000-year flood a year after we’re supposed to have had a one-in-100-year flood [in Sydney last March] basically refutes that straight away.” Mortlock says the chance of a catastrophic flood occurring somewhere in NSW, across all the areas at risk of flood in any given year, is much greater than 0.1%. It is higher still when there is a La Niña weather pattern. A La Niña pushes warm surface water towards Asia and the seas north of Australia, which in turn leads to increased rainfall across northern and eastern Australia. Mortlock says La Niña has “loaded the dice in favour of flooding over the past two years”. He says one issue with saying a flood on this scale only occurs once in a millennium is the suggestion that it was not foreseeable, and that there is no need to plan for the next catastrophic storm when in reality it could come much, much sooner. As we have seen this week, failing to properly plan can have terrible consequences for people’s lives and livelihoods. Some people had rebuilt homes and businesses after previous floods, believing it was unlikely that a similar catastrophe would strike them in the near future. They were hit again, to devastating effect. A key question is: would a more realistic expression of the probability of a flood reoccurring have helped limit the impact? Yes. No flood can be blamed directly on the climate crisis, but it also loads the dice. The scientific rule of thumb is that 1C of heating allows the atmosphere to hold about 7% more moisture. The planet has already warmed more than 1C since pre-industrial times due to increased atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. It increases the risk. Dr Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, agrees with Mortlock: saying a flood is a one-in-1,000-year event is “definitely a misleading statistic”, he says, particularly when applied to several different places at once. “People don’t understand that it doesn’t mean an event happens every 1,000 years, and in a changing climate the probability of these events will change as well.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A key issue here is that the likelihood of an event recurring changes retrospectively as more data is collected. Put another way, it can be seen in hindsight that the chance of an extreme event like a flood happening was greater than previously understood. An example of this is the flood in Queensland’s Lockyer Valley in 2011. A flood of that scale was initially deemed to have a one-in-2,000 chance of happening in any given year. After another flood came along two years later, and with five more years of data, that was recalculated to a one-in-90 chance – a substantial upgrade in likelihood. King also gives the example of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has been described as a 1-in-100 year event based purely on there having been only one other global pandemic in recent history – the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. He says this misunderstands an important thing about recurrence statistics – that as you add more data, “you change them a lot”.",News/Australia news,"Are eastern Australia’s catastrophic floods really a one-in-1,000 year event?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/are-eastern-australias-catastrophic-floods-really-a-one-in-1000-year-event
3/4/2022,"Aharsh sun shines down across the still partially flooded Lismore, spreading the smell of mud and sewage through the humid air, as Mark Bailey holds an album of vintage East German stamps that is dripping brown. “Everything in there’s fucked,” he says, as he hurls it onto a pile of ruined goods and furniture he had been amassing at the front of his store, just like many other shop owners along Molesworth Street in the centre of town. While each pile looks a similar shade of brown, the muddied faces of Queen Elizabeth, Karl Marx, Michael Jordan and gold prospector Edward Hargraves on loose stamps, faded banknotes and sports cards are visible up close. Bailey believes the collectibles in his pile are worth about $5m, at least they were, before flood waters rose above the ceiling of The Penny Man – the shop he manages as a partner – earlier this week. Now, he will throw everything out, save for some antique items he believes he can salvage. The shop was uninsurable, given its position near the riverbank in flood-prone Lismore, and had only been open since December. When the evacuation orders were issued on Sunday night he did not have enough time to organise a truck to save the valuables in his shop. He says he felt sick waiting days for the waters to recede, knowing he would be returning to millions in damage. “I’m not mad at anyone in particular, every shop has a different story along here,” he says. “We won’t be reopening here, and I would be surprised if half of the street ever does.” He is yet to lodge a business activity statement for the business, and is worried he won’t qualify for the government support grants he already knows “won’t scratch the surface” of the true cost of what he has lost in the floods. As the nation’s attention largely turned from the news reports of Lismore’s residents returning to their ruined homes to the heavy rain and flood warnings in Sydney on Thursday, the mammoth cleanup task continued at homes and shops across the northern river. Next door to The Penny Man, opposite the local MP Kevin Hogan’s electorate office, is the Mega Choice discount variety store. Its pile of ruined stock is a rainbow of children’s toys, costumes, greeting cards and cleaning supplies – it still looks brown. While the store’s owners have been stuck in Ballina, locals have begun helping bring the aisles of products out onto the street. Underneath a sign next to the checkouts that reads “The store with more”, are bare shelves, with ruined goods strewn across the floor. Few businesses have been able to reopen, contributing to the food access issues that have been driven by severed supply routes and seen empty supermarket shelves in neighbouring towns. Free meals are provided at a church and by Sikh volunteers who drove into town. While the waters have receded, some parts of town are still inaccessible. As emergency services continue to survey the damage, everyone is dreading the discovery of more bodies. On Wednesday, police revealed how search teams in south Lismore earlier had heard a faint call for help from inside a home where water had reached the eaves. After a constable dove through an open window, they discovered a 93-year-old woman floating on a mattress, with “no more than 20cm of room between the roof and the water level”. She was pulled from the home on a boogie board and then onto a rescue boat. However, many of the stories of local rescue operations, and the most up to date death toll, are taking days to spread, due to the lack of internet or patchy mobile coverage. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For the most part, locals are still focused on cleaning up their homes. In the streets of Lismore that are now accessible, the piles of ruined possessions continue to grow. After lunchtime on Thursday, Orion Street sounded a bit like a tip. At one house a man emptied a large storage container full of muddied toys on a pile on his frontage. Next door, a woman hurled broken furniture and books from the second floor of her elevated Queenslander-style house. At a neighbouring house, broken timber chairs were balanced on a refrigerator door, which still had family photo magnets stuck on it. The task of cleaning up the town and others in the northern rivers will take many months and probably far longer than the floods of 2017, the most recent disaster milestone in the region’s collective memory. It was then that Lismore’s levee was breached for the first time, however these last few days have set a new, terrifying benchmark.

3/4/2022,"I’m awful at spending time alone. Most of my time is spent with my partner and small friendship group, however when I do spend time alone I always find myself wishing there was someone else there with me and feeling lonely. How can I combat this? I’d really like to feel comfortable in my own company, especially considering my social circle is quite small. Eleanor says: People can get oddly moralistic about sending time alone, like there’s a set amount that’s Good For You. Too little and people assume you’re running from yourself (Schopenhauer: man can be himself only when he is alone); too much and you look like a solipsistic ass who thinks their own company is superior to everyone else’s. In fact the “correct” amount of solitude is probably like the correct amount of work or sex: barring some radical extremes, it’s whatever makes you feel proud and content. So if you try to change this and find you can’t, don’t worry too much – there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with wishing for company just as there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with longing for pastures when you’re in the city, or music when there’s silence. Each of us needs a different amount of these things to make our minds feel fed and still. You asked how you could start to combat this. I think the metaphor you used of spending time “in your own company” is illuminating. Solitude really does feel like company when it’s going well – your inner voice starts to feel like a dialogue, you learn things about yourself just like learning to read a friend. But we’d never expect to enjoy anyone else’s company just by turning up and sitting in silence, and often, that’s exactly how we expect to enjoy our own. The partner goes out or the regular routines are off for the night and we sit still in a big boring absence, wondering when it’ll start to feel like Walden. Instead, try to build your relationship with yourself as you would with anyone else. Give yourself fun things to do together. Decide on a start time for a commitment like a class or a meal and chat afterwards about how it was. Do something abjectly silly to see if you can make yourself laugh – anything that mirrors how you’d build a relationship with a friend. Having activities for your personality to bounce off will make solitude feel more like being in your own company and less like just being alone. It helps to keep hands occupied and screens off (but background audio can help the mind wander). One of the joys of this approach is you get to see sides of yourself you normally wouldn’t. When we’re with other people all the time, we only experience the parts of ourselves that emerge with those people – the traits forged by our particular dynamic. It can be fun to do things alone that bring out other parts of you – if you’re always responsible, do something silly; if you’re always high-energy, try to be still. You might find you hate being those ways, but it’s useful to play with the possibility that you can. Finally, try to treat this like any other skill: start small, don’t be defeated when it doesn’t happen all at once, and write down why you want to be better at it so you can revisit those reasons when your motivation starts to flag. Try not to think of solitude as just time spent with yourself. Try to think of it as something liberating: a chance to be what you aren’t around other people, and a chance to do whatever you’d like.

3/4/2022,"On Wednesday’s Late Night, Seth Meyers recapped Republican antics over Joe Biden’s State of the Union speech on Tuesday evening, starting with a notable no-show: Marco Rubio. The senator from Florida skipped the national address because he refused to take the required Covid test, claiming he “didn’t have time”. “I’m sorry, what? You don’t have time to get your nose swabbed for 10 seconds?” Meyers remarked. “Now there’s two possibilities here. One, Marco Rubio is a bozo pandering to a base that somehow thinks a 10-second nose swab is an act of tyranny. Or two, he’s been taking the wrong test. In which case, I empathize with this poor man. “Look, it sucks for normal people who have to wait in long lines for Covid tests,” Meyers added, “but Rubio is a senator. It would literally take him 30 seconds.” “This was a joint address to Congress where the president praised brave Ukrainians for resisting Russian aggression and laid out his plan to deter Putin, among many other things, and Rubio just skipped it because he didn’t want to get his nose swabbed,” he continued. “I mean, sorry man, but you don’t get to say ‘no thanks’ when you have an important work meeting.” Meyers also mocked the performative disruptions of the GOP congresswomen and known conspiracy theorists Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene. The two women first turned their backs on Biden’s cabinet when they entered the room, and shouted “build the wall!” during Biden’s speech. Boebert and Greene’s actions “might make you angry”, said Meyers, “but if I’ve learned any one thing from watching Real Housewives, it’s that two white ladies this erratic will eventually turn on one another. “All these people want is attention and they’re willing to do anything to get it, including yelling at the president during an address to the nation,” he added of Boebert and Greene. “And look, I don’t care that much about decorum,” he concluded. “I do care about not being annoying, and these two are some of the most annoying people I’ve ever seen on the national stage. I mean, they’re like a non-stop national hangnail.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on the “fierce Ukrainian resistance” to the Russian invasion, which has led some Russian troops to abandon their arms and tanks. Ukrainian authorities have gone as far as to say that citizens don’t need to declare captured Russian tanks and military equipment for tax purposes. “Well, that is great news, because we’ve all been there,” joked Colbert. “You come across an abandoned Russian T-72 BT tank and your first thought is ‘how is this going to impact my taxable income?’” Colbert also showed a clip of a Ukrainian grandmother who explained how she learned to make molotov cocktails by looking on Google. “Ugh, Googling molotov cocktails is always such a pain,” Colbert deadpanned. “Because first you have to scroll through a whole blogpost — ‘as a busy mom, it can be tough to find an explosives recipe that works for the whole family. By the time I get Kayleigh and Braxton home from soccer practice, I just want a 30-minute way to vanquish the armies of darkness. Thank goodness for my Cosori air fryer.’” To get around internet censorship in Russia, people have been posting Google reviews for restaurants in Moscow and St Petersburg with information on the war in Ukraine, such as “Your president started a war against Ukraine. Your government is lying to you!” and “This is a no win situation for all.” “That last one is actually the slogan of the Moscow Taco Bell,” Colbert quipped. The State of the Union left us with so many questions: Did Chuck Schumer rehearse that standing ovation? Did Pelosi take all of Biden’s pills? And who is HIM? pic.twitter.com/p0v5GiUSyR And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah lightly mocked some of Biden’s gaffes during the State of the Union address. “Biden being Biden, there were a bunch of moments in the speech that were just a little bit weirder than they had to be,” Noah explained, such as when, while trying to praise the administration’s vaccination efforts, Biden said he’d “ordered more pills than anyone in the world has”. “OK, I guess the party is at Joe Biden’s house tonight!” said Noah. Biden also tried to praise the people of Ukraine, but ended up saying: “Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but it will never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people.” “Technically true,” Noah noted. “It is technically true that Putin can do whatever he wants in Ukraine – nothing will make the Iranians back down. “At times, this speech was like a birthday card from a four-year-old,” he summarized. “A lot of the words didn’t make sense, but you got what it was trying to say.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers on Boebert and Greene: ‘Like a non-stop national hangnail’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/03/seth-meyers-boebert-greene-stephen-colbert-trevor-noah
3/4/2022,"Members of the public are paying for Airbnb rentals in Ukraine to help get money directly to residents who are facing extreme financial hardship because of the Russian invasion. The home rental platform has already moved to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, but members of the public have come up with a novel way to financially help those who either intend to remain – or are trapped – in the country owing to the conflict. One couple, who have made a booking for the 3-10 March in Kyiv, turned to Twitter to publicise the initiative. “Hello Maria, my wife and I have just booked your apartment for one week, but of course we will not be visiting,” said one person in a post to the owner of the property that showed confirmation of the stay. “This is just so you can receive some money.” HOW TO HELP - just booked a Kiev AirBnb for 1 week, simply as a means of getting money directly into the hands of Kiev residents. It's really cheap and can make a small difference right now. Please share this idea #Ukraine #Russia #StopWarInUkraine #StopPutinNOW #UkraineRussiaWar pic.twitter.com/7yQDLYRkph Another Twitter user said they had also booked a week’s stay, and encouraged others to share the idea. A third called on Airbnb to drop its fees, which typically range from 3% to 15%, so the Ukrainian hosts receive all the proceeds. An Airbnb spokeswoman confirmed they would be waiving fees in the country. “We appreciate the generosity of our community during this moment of crisis,” she said. “Airbnb is also waiving all guest and host fees on all bookings in Ukraine at this time.” Airbnb, which last year took bookings for 300m nights across 4 million hosts globally worth $46.8bn (£35bn), lists more than 300 properties for rental across Ukraine. Brian Chesky, its chief executive and co-founder, said the company would review whether to continue its operations in Russia as a result of Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine. “We don’t have a large business in Russia,” he told CNN. “It is not one of our major markets. [But] we are absolutely revisiting our relationship [about whether] to do business in Russia.” On Monday, Airbnb pledged to offer free housing to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees. The spokeswoman said the company had received an “overwhelming response” to its initiative to provide housing for refugees, with more than 260,000 visitors so far to its dedicated webpage, where it is possible sign up to be host or donate. Chesky said that in the last decade the company had provided housing free-of-charge to 54,000 refugees globally in conjunction with its hosts, most recently in relation to last year’s humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. “In a global humanitarian crisis like this I think everyone should ask the question: how can we help,” he said. “The way Airbnb can help is we provide housing for millions of people every night all over the world. If you want to take in a refugee family we are going to work with resettlement partners.” Chesky said he and his co-founders would also be contributing their own money to the cause. The 40-year-old was awarded stock worth $120m after Airbnb’s flotation in 2020, with its ultimate value dependent on the performance of the business over the next decade. Chesky, who has pledged to donate the net proceeds from his equity award to “community, philanthropic and charitable causes”, and has given $100m in stock to a $1.7bn endowment fund set up to help Airbnb hosts, earned total compensation of $421,000 in 2019.",News/Technology,Ukraine Airbnbs being booked in effort to get money to residents,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/03/ukraine-airbnbs-booked-in-effort-to-get-money-to-residents-pay-not-stay
3/4/2022,"Sixty years after he painted it, you can still catch the reek of cheap oil paint and linseed oil coming off Leon Kossoff’s 1962 Willesden Junction, Early Morning. With its glutinous and heaving sea of wrinkled paint, Kossoff’s city is the colour of sludge under a filthy sky, the view slewing away, a tower block lurching on the horizon. All that’s needed is the tang of the soot that caked the buildings, the smells of tobacco smoke, wet newsprint, coal gas and sulphurous yellow smog to bring us back to postwar Britain, a period that didn’t seem to end till some time in the 1970s, if it ever entirely did. Angry young men, armchair existentialists and young male sculptors in hefty jumpers, demobbed dreamers and conscientious objectors, artists arriving from the colonies or who had escaped the Holocaust and the ruins of Europe, made the British art world of the postwar period much more cosmopolitan, and, incrementally, less class-bound, than it had been previously. But we keep being dragged back. One of William Turnbull’s low reliefs, called Playgound, shows stele-like forms on a low slab. Maybe they’re figures. Giacometti’s influence is obvious. Further reliefs, viewed from above, are dotted with buildings or ruins. Turnbull had been an RAF pilot and it is difficult not to think of reconnaissance flights and bomb damage. They’re juxtaposed here with Bert Hardy’s photographs of mothers and children sitting around and playing on a vast, inner city bombsite in Edgbaston, Birmingham, in the early 1950s. The sun is shining and it’s probably better to be outside than in the 19th-century industrial slum where they live. Roger Mayne’s photographs of children in a bombed-out building in Bermondsey, looking out through the empty spaces where the windows once were, continue the theme. Shirley Baker’s photographs of working-class women in Manchester during the mid-60s slum clearances, and Eva Frankfurther’s paintings of exhausted mothers, female workers and West Indian waitresses have an awful tenderness. Postwar Modern: New Art in Britain at the Barbican takes us from 1945 to 1965, and it’s worth saying from the start that the task is impossible. It’s OK on paper – and in the exhibition’s excellent catalogue – but the confines of the Barbican’s gallery don’t provide room for the show to fully realise itself. Nevertheless this is a fascinating show, and is likely, for those that didn’t live through the period, to be filled with surprises. I grew up with all this stuff, and still found it compelling. Near the start, John Latham’s 1961 Full Stop – a black circle, spray-painted on to a white canvas, appears both as an end-point and a beginning. Pffftt, it goes, swimming on the canvas like a black hole, swallowing everything. It makes Lynn Chadwick’s angular welded The Fisheater, with an Alexander Calder-ish mobile hanging from it, and made for the 1951 Festival of Britain, look both whimsical and utterly old-fashioned in its aching attempt to be modern. A lot of British art of the period plays catch-up, from Elisabeth Frink’s dalliance with French sculptor Germaine Richier to Alan Davie’s Jackson Pollock-influenced paintings, and Gillian Ayres’s attempts to paint on the scale and with the looseness of Helen Frankenthaler. Ayres invariably wearies me. Patrick Heron’s Rothko-like stacks of banded colour, in a painting from 1957, look much more suave and with it, in a knowing sort of way. But that’s also Heron’s weakness, one that he shares with the abstracted tabletop still-lifes of William Scott, with their furtive sexual subject matter, and the protestant austerity of his pots and pans. Postwar Modern goes on to take us from the geometry of fear (lots of ferocious claws and damaged bodies) to the kitchen sink. John Bratby painted his wife Jean, naked at the breakfast table, crowded out by the Corn Flakes and Shredded Wheat packages, the cruets and bowls. Hard to know how to read her expression. Does Bratby know that he has captured a look both of cowed fear and dislike on her face? He probably didn’t care. Bratby was a domestic tyrant. A far better painter, Jean Cooke records her own unhappiness, and a black eye, on her own canvases. As an antidote, it is a relief to find Sylvia Sleigh’s terrific portraits of her lover, the young critic Lawrence Alloway. In 1949, Sleigh paints her future husband cross-dressed as a renaissance bride, and as a more modern spouse in a patterned dress, holding a petunia. Both costumes were sewn for him, or for his alter ego Hetty Remington, by Sleigh. The show’s catalogue is full of such human details. Sleigh went on to paint other male subjects in female guises. Lucian Freud’s portrait of his soon-to-be-estranged wife Caroline Blackwood, who he had eloped to Paris with in 1954, has Freud hovering by the bed. The Imperial Hotel in Henley-on-Thames was the unlikely setting for Francis Bacon’s trysts with his ex fighter-pilot lover Peter Lacy, and where Bacon painted a series of portraits of a lone man in a suit at a darkened bar in 1954. The setting is theatrically dim and somehow menacing, and a more modern, sleek interior than the Imperial, with its mock-tudor exterior, probably provided. Nearby, David Hockney goes to New York in 1961, where a painted sign reads QUEENS UPTOWN, and he paints himself as a little lipsticked devil. In 1959, Alloway wrote of the “anti-modernism which is never far from the surface of the London art world”, calling British critics and journalists “contentedly fogbound”. He moved to the US with Sleigh, the same year as Hockney’s first visit, where Sleigh went on to become a leading figure in the feminist art movement. Through the 1950s, Alloway had also been a key member of the Independent group, which included brutalist architects Alison and Peter Smithson, architectural theorist Reyner Banham, Turnbull, Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton, John McHale and his Hungarian wife Magda Cordell, whose large-scale paintings are one of the great surprises of this show, as are those of Polish-born Franciszka Themerson. Themerson’s paintings are delicate, violent and funny. In one, a man wears a dinky ball and chain and his insides are all a mess. Cordell’s big paintings are like exuberant, oozy disembowelments and eviscerations, in gorgeous colours. Eduardo Paolozzi’s colossal figures stand about, with their boxy heads and embossed forms, part human, part cyborg. With time, visions of the future remind us as much of the period they spring from as the future they predict. This can make such objects and images ridiculous or tragic. Paolozzi’s figures look to me like ruins. The Smithsons’ futuristic House of the Future, constructed for the Daily Mail’s 1956 Ideal Home Exhibition at Olympia, with its moulded plastic bucket chairs and other aerodynamic, soft-edged furniture and fittings, might almost be a pastiche of itself, both futuristic and retro, knowing and innocent. The Smithsons even had live models in there, acting all modern. The calm, clean lines and rational constructivism of Mary and Kenneth Martin, Anthony Hill and Victor Pasmore might also be taken as an escape from all the messiness elsewhere, but I have always found this whole strand of British art too earnest and goody-goody to care for, a bit too cultish and superior for its own good. It is also worth remembering how unhealthily cliquish and factionalised and generationally divided the British art scene was, and continued to be, well into the 1980s, much more so than it seems to me to be now. But at least it seemed to be about ideas, was argumentative and spirited. Some of that seems to have been lost.
