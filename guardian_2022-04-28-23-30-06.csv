4/28/2022,"Some of Britain’s biggest sea ports are considering legal action against the government to recover the costs of building border control posts they fear will never be used, after confirmation that post-Brexit import checks will be delayed for a fourth time. Controls on food and animal products would not be introduced until at least 2023, said Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, in a written statement published on Thursday. His announcement provoked fury from the owners of ports who said they had wasted millions of pounds to hurriedly install border infrastructure. The British Ports Association (BPA), a lobby group for the industry, said it was concerned the expensively built border posts may never be used. The lobby group said its members would ask for permission to bulldoze the new buildings if the government confirmed this was the case. An industry source said some port companies would seek to recover costs such as construction, as well as the money spent recruiting staff to start in July. Checks on meat were due to start on 1 July and on dairy on 1 September, with all remaining foods including fish and composite foods to be subject to checks from 1 November. Rees-Mogg told MPs the government would target the end of 2023 for a new controls regime – three years after the Brexit transition period ended. He said the move could save British businesses “up to £1bn in annual costs”. The new checks – which are required because of the UK’s departure from the EU’s single market – had been planned to begin in July, but the government has argued that high energy costs, exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, meant it would be wrong to impose them now. Some industry sources had expressed concerns the import of food products such cheese and Parma ham from the EU could have been severely disrupted if government computer systems could not cope. Richard Ballantyne, the BPA’s chief executive, said the latest delay was “quite an amazing development”. “Many UK port operators have built border control posts in preparation for post-Brexit checks and all were due to be ready,” he said. “This announcement is a major policy change, meaning the facilities will effectively become white elephants, wasting millions of pounds of public and private funding, not to mention the huge effort there has been to get things ready in time.” The checks that will be delayed include requirements for sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks and health certification on EU imports, a requirement for safety and security declarations on EU imports, and prohibitions and restrictions on the import of chilled meats from the EU.",News/Politics,UK sea ports to press for compensation after Rees-Mogg delays Brexit controls,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/uk-sea-ports-consider-legal-action-delay-brexit-controls-jacob-rees-mogg
4/28/2022,"An aggressive draft campaign by the Russian-backed separatists who control parts of eastern Ukraine has emptied the area’s streets of military-age men, with many in hiding to avoid being sent to the frontline. In a sign of how desperate pro-Russia authorities are to bolster the ranks of fighters, in late March they announced that the upper age limit of the draft had been raised from 55 to 65 in Donetsk, local media reported. And on Saturday authorities announced a mobilisation in the region of Kherson, which was largely captured by Russia after the war began. Men who do not want to become cannon fodder in a war they do not support, against a country – Ukraine – that most of them still consider their own, are spending their days in hiding. Locals joke that they now live in a town of Amazons, run by women. Husbands, sons and brothers live in basements or locked indoors. They cannot stay in their own homes because registration is by address. Instead they stay at the homes of friends or relatives where no military-age men are listed as residents. Some come out at night, when the patrols rounding up unwilling recruits pause or are less frequent. “When I walk my dog at 11pm I could see the silhouettes of men smoking behind the curtains, with a window open,” said one resident reached by phone, who like most in Donetsk did not want to be quoted by name. By day their jobs have been taken over by wives, sisters or female friends, or have simply gone unfilled. It is almost impossible to get a car repaired because most of the city’s mechanics are men who would be covered by the draft, locals said. “It usually takes 45 minute to fix a problem with my tyres, and I just grab a coffee nearby,” said one woman. “But last time I was asked to drop my car and leave it over the weekend so that they could bring a guy to fix it at night.” Electronics shops in the market that used to be staffed by men are now run by female relatives, who put the usual owners on the line to handle any questions. “You discuss all the technical details with him and then she will just give you what you wanted and take your money,” said one man who escaped the draft because of a medical condition and a foreign passport. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, the so-called separatist region backed and recognised by Russia, announced its draft on 19 February, a few days before the invasion of the rest of Ukraine. Exemptions have to be signed off by senior government officials, who themselves are one of the few groups to be spared the draft. The order went out extremely early to try to prevent the men affected from fleeing, and those caught included some visitors from the Ukrainian-controlled part of the country. “My son went back to our home village to check on his grandmother two days before the draft was announced. Now he is stuck in the DNR and I am very worried,” said one man in western Ukraine, trying to gather money to fund an escape. “He is in hiding, and hasn’t left the house for two months now. There are ways to smuggle him out, but only to Russia and it is very expensive and risky.” In interviews with residents of the region, the Guardian heard of only two men granted leave to stay in their jobs. One was an anaesthesiologist, allowed to stay at his post when other doctors were ordered to join the military because he was one of just two experts left in the city. The other was a driver trained in using complicated construction equipment. Bribes work but the cost of draft-dodging is $800, an exorbitant amount for most people in an already poor area with an economy now crippled by the war. Men pushing the top end of the draft age group have grown beards in an attempt to look older, although the raising of the upper limit to 65 means grey hair alone offers little protection. In a further sign of desperation, city authorities have twice tried to lure men out of hiding by claiming the draft was finishing. Documents purporting to be government leaks about a new policy were shared on Telegram channels, but then men who came out of hiding because of them were seized and drafted. Locals now say they will not believe any more news of the draft being cancelled. “Two times the authorities have tried to fool us by posting info that draft is over. So the next morning men started going out and they were all taken,” said another resident. “Now everyone learned the lesson so if they will announce that draft is over no one will believe them.”",News/World news,Donetsk separatists’ desperate draft campaign empties streets of men,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/donetsk-separatists-desperate-draft-campaign-empties-streets-of-men-ukraine
4/28/2022,"NatWest executives are bracing for a potential shareholder rebellion at their annual general meeting on Thursday over a new pay policy that could net its chief executive, Alison Rose, as much as £5.2m a year. The bank’s new pay policy – which will be put to a shareholder vote on Thursday afternoon – would see Rose’s potential bonus payouts increase by 25%, and result in a 43% rise for finance chief, Katie Murray, by 2023. Rose was paid nearly £3.6m in 2021. It will mark the first executive pay overhaul since the bank returned to majority private control last month, when the UK government stake fell below 50% to 48.1%. NatWest – formerly Royal Bank of Scotland Group – was nationalised through a £46bn bailout at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Influential shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis is recommending that shareholders vote against the pay plan, amid concerns over the increase in potential executive pay, as well as the decision to replace long-term incentive plan (LTIP) with a scheme with fewer performance metrics that could make it easier to secure payouts. “We are concerned by the increase in overall incentive opportunity and the introduction of an RSP (Restricted Share Plan) absent a compelling strategic rationale for this type of award structure,” Glass Lewis said in its report. The new restricted share plan will allow Rose to earn as much as 150% of her £1.1m salary, while the new bonus plan will give the banking boss a chance to again double her base pay. Together, the changes will allow Rose to earn 25% more in bonuses than under the current policy, and raise Rose’s potential pay prospects by 19%. It means the NatWest chief executive could earn as much as £5.2m by the time the policy is fully implemented in 2023. NatWest has defended its proposals, saying that while it was aware the policy could court controversy, the changes would bring executive pay closer to levels offered by rival UK banks. “We recognise that the move to a more normal construct which involves an increase to total compensation represents a material change and intend to make the transition to the new policy over two years,” NatWest said in its annual report. Shareholders will cast their votes on Thursday afternoon at the NatWest AGM, which is being held at its Gogarburn campus in Edinburgh.",News/Business,NatWest faces rebellion over executive pay overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/natwest-faces-rebellion-over-executive-pay-overhaul
4/28/2022,"Fifty years down the line, what does Roxy Music mean to you? Jungtheforeman A lot. Roxy Music were the first 10 years of my career, so it’s a huge part of my life. Some of my best work was done on those albums and I was lucky to be part of such a unique group. Andy Mackay had a classical background, Brian Eno electronic music, Phil Manzanera a guitarist with Latin American roots, Paul Thompson a great drummer, and Graham Simpson [bass] was a jazz aficionado. They all brought something special and there was a great sense of camaraderie – you get very close to people, making music – and lots of laughs. The early period, especially, was very exciting, but we were always rushing to finish songs or albums and we crammed a lot into 10 years. Antony Price, who was from Yorkshire, helped me with the album covers and designed some very interesting clothes for us, very ahead of his time. I’ve recently been working on my book of lyrics, and the Roxy songs brought back great memories. I’m looking forward to touring with the band later in the year. Which Roxy album are you most proud of? Are there any that you feel maybe haven’t aged so well? PugwashCanary The first album was interesting and obviously pointed to several different directions, but For Your Pleasure was a big album for me. We’d been on the road and were much more experienced and integrated. We recorded in Air Studios with engineers in lab coats, high above Oxford Street, with people running around below. It felt like the centre of everything. The album just felt more mature: darker, with better singing. Today my other favourite is Avalon, 10 years later: very different, a real mood album, very atmospheric. Maybe the Manifesto album isn’t as strong as the others. Obviously it’s got Dance Away but there are tracks – Trash, My Little Girl, Cry Cry Cry – that I wouldn’t listen to now. Are there any Roxy Music songs that you feel were underappreciated and deserve another listen? DecafAmericano Sometimes less obvious songs get overshadowed. I thought the opening, title track of Manifesto – with Alan Spenner playing great bass – was very strong. I’d done [1978 solo album] The Bride Stripped Bare with American musicians and was disappointed with how it was received. Punk had happened and I felt out of step, so I wanted to come back more in tune with what was happening. Sentimental Fool [from Siren, 1975] and The Bogus Man [For Your Pleasure, 1973] are also out-on-a-limb tracks that never got played on the radio, but are great if people have the time to listen. I first saw Roxy Music at Reading town hall in 1972. I made my dad park round the corner because I didn’t want to be seen getting a lift home, particularly not in a Hillman Avenger. Anyway, I came out of that doughty old venue thinking that I had seen the future. That weekend, I dyed my fringe bright green with cake colourant and ordered a pair of cherry-red geisha-style block heels from the classified section of the NME. Overnight, I went from a slightly underage hippy to a startling overornamented sulker. What or who had a similar effect on you? dinahdrew My road to Damascus experience was in 1967 when I hitchhiked from Newcastle to London to see the Stax/Volt Revue. I didn’t have any money but somebody might give you a lift for 50 miles, then 20 … It was a pilgrimage and a very powerful experience, seeing incredible musicians, one after another: Eddie Floyd, Steve Cropper. Really powerful singing, and it was very visual. Sam and Dave came on in canary yellow suits. Otis Redding strode across the stage in a bright red suit, grabbing the audience from the first note. It was like all these great records coming to life in front of you. I’d sung for a couple of years in college [in local band the Gas Board] and had sort of [laughs] retired by then to concentrate on my art studies, but that show changed my life. I thought: “This is something I wish I could do.” The whistling solo on Jealous Guy has to be one of the best examples in recorded music. Did you have to practise for long? BarryAverage As far as I remember it was pretty spontaneous, but I must’ve done a lot of whistling on my paper round in Washington [Tyne and Wear] when I was a young lad. I had a round before school in the morning and another in the evening, and on Saturday, after working in a tailor’s shop, I’d deliver the football special. Depending on whether the household you were delivering to were Newcastle or Sunderland supporters you’d deliver a black paper or a pink one. I had the best round: the heaviest bag, but it paid the most money. Thirty shillings a week. As a fellow exiled north-easterner, how much do you think the NE shaped who you were and now are? orso I’m proud of my northern background, and growing up in the north-east gave me a good grounding. As a family we were poor but everyone worked hard, got on with life and had a good time. Washington at that time was a pit village surrounded by farmland. My dad was a very quiet country guy who started life as a farm worker, ploughing fields with horses. He later looked after the pit ponies at the local colliery. My mother was from the town, and full of life. I learned a lot from both of them, especially that strong work ethic. After graduating from art school in Newcastle I moved to London to do what I had to do. I love my trips back north. A sense of humour is important up there and it’s something I have in common with Roxy’s [drummer] Paul Thompson, a fellow geordie. What’s your favourite pub in Newcastle? Graemel In my student days I went to the pubs in the Bigg Market, the Lord Chancellor and the Royal Court. That had fairy lights over the bar and a great jukebox. Those pubs were rough – you had to watch yourself and you wouldn’t find many students there – but then we’d walk home to where we lived in Jesmond. I used to go there with the historian Jeremy Catto, who was teaching in Durham. He was one of my great mentors. Very intelligent – medieval history, not my field – but great fun. You studied art under my great uncle Richard Hamilton. Do you have any standout memories of your time with him? xFallenAngelx Richard was an important influence when I was a student. He was such a cool and charismatic figure. I remember being quite in awe of him at tutorials, as he paced the room, cigar in hand, intense and eloquent. He was the most intellectual of artists and it was inspiring to be around him in the mid 6os, when he was doing such great work. His enthusiasm for American pop culture had a big impact on me at an impressionable age, and his well-known collage Just What Is It That Makes Today’s Homes So Different, So Appealing? led to my own interest in making collages of sound. What is the best use of your music in other media? It’s surely Bill Murray in Lost in Translation? catchy-titled I’d have to agree. It’s a pivotal moment in the film when Bill Murray sings More Than This and reveals his vulnerable side. You turned down the option to record Don’t You (Forget About Me) for the 1985 film The Breakfast Club. Simple Minds’ subsequent version sold more than 1m copies in the UK and went to No 1 in the US. Why didn’t you record the song? McScootikins It was just bad timing. We were finishing off [the solo album] Boys and Girls, which was way behind schedule, and we didn’t want the distraction. The songwriter Keith Forsey sent me a demo of the song and it sounded like a hit to me. Simple Minds did a great version of it. You’ve recorded a vast repertoire of cover versions during your career. Do you have a favourite and have you ever received feedback from the original writer/performer(s)? fairdes If pressed I’d have to say A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall. It was my first cover and I like the energy of it. The one time I remember getting feedback was when two songwriters in Nashville wrote to thank me for my rendition of their little-known song River of Salt, on my first solo album, These Foolish Things. In my record collection I had a 45 of Ketty Lester’s Love Letters and River of Salt was the B-side. I released my version of Love Letters just a month ago. Are there any covers of your own songs that you particularly like? Catupatree Grace Jones’s version of Love Is the Drug is very cool. She worked with Sly and Robbie at Compass Point Studios in Nassau, where we recorded some of Avalon. It grooves much better than our version. Can you explain how Mother of Pearl came about? DecafAmericano In 1973, while I was working on the songs for the Roxy Music album Stranded, I went off to Greece to do some writing. Roxy’s press agent, Simon Puxley, came with me. Simon was an inspirational character and a great sounding board for my songs; I respected his opinions. He wrote those great sleevenotes for the first album. I’d taken a bass guitar, a keyboard and a cassette recorder, and I wrote Mother of Pearl while I was out there. It’s one of my favourites. What is your writing process is like? Grant_Thunder I usually write music at the piano, but lyrics can be jotted down anywhere. There’s no particular formula for songwriting. I’m not a fast writer and sometimes they take a long time to complete. Some of my favourite songs are the simpler ones, like Chance Meeting [from 1976]. My nephew is studying music composition at the Royal Academy of Music. What would be the best advice you could give him to promote his talent and career? LawyerJo Get a good manager. What, artistically, don’t you like about yourself? Floraison Procrastination. The woman saying “You don’t ask. You don’t ask why” at the end of For Your Pleasure is none other than Judi Dench. Was that a sample of her voice or was she booked for the recording session? HugoBarrett It was something Brian Eno sampled from the radio. It worked so well in the track. Do you still smoke Dunhill cigarettes, and if not, when did you stop? Bobbio39 I stopped about 20 years ago. I used to smoke a lot of Dunhills and before that St Moritz, and before that Gitanes, Lucky Strike, Camel and, further back, Woodbines. You could buy them in packets of five. How did you come up with strange intro to the wonderful Remake/Remodel – a brave and fascinating way to launch the first track on your crucial first album? CoimbraSportinguista It seemed like a good idea to start our first album with a party scene, a kind of celebration. We used sound effects tapes and added our own voices to the party to make it more real. Avalon marked a sea change in your sound: from that album on, you’ve fairly consistently taken a sleek, precision-tooled production approach. There have been stabs, though (for instance, on Frantic and Dylanesque), at a return to rawer, more spontaneous recording. Do you ever regret the loss of the more eclectic style of the Roxy era? Or do you look back on those records as a journey towards the sound you were after and finally caught? Mazzini I’ve been lucky to work in a band and as a solo artist. When you’re working in a group situation you sometimes have certain limitations that can make for a rougher, more direct sound. With Roxy we had the best of both worlds, a great range of sounds to play with and we enjoyed experimenting with them. When you’re working as a solo artist you sometimes have too many possibilities and then there’s a danger of overproducing. Nobody wants to make the same record each time, so you try out different things and some work better than others. It’s a musical journey that can take you to unexpected places. There’s always somewhere else to go.  Lyrics by Bryan Ferry is published on 5 May by Chatto & Windus. Tracks from the digital EP Love Letters are out now or released in May.

4/28/2022,"First performed in 1821, Weber’s Der Freischütz was a milestone in the development of opera in the 19th century, a score whose evocation of the archetypal forest of the Romantic imagination and its world of magic and superstition would influence generations of composers in Germany and beyond. But what we now know of the work, and what we usually see in the opera house, are not quite what Weber and his librettist, Johann Friedrich Kind, initially envisaged. In the original text, the overture is followed by a scene between Agathe and the mysterious Hermit, in which she tells him of her fiance Max and is given a bunch of consecrated flowers that will protect her. Dramatically it’s a significant scene, and gives much more sense to the Hermit’s sudden appearance at the end of the opera, which usually seems a bit contrived; the work begins and ends with him. But to Kind’s dismay, Weber’s wife prevailed upon the composer to drop the encounter altogether, and to replace another number later in the opera with a spoken monologue. Weber later regretted his decision, and made sure that what he called the “prologue” was restored to printed versions of the libretto. Some stage productions of Freischütz now remedy the omission by including the scene as spoken dialogue, but for this recording René Jacobs, never a conductor to do things by halves, has gone one step further. In creating what he calls his Hörspiel (radio play) version of the opera, he sets Kind’s missing text to music from elsewhere in the score, including the overture, and brings in a drinking song by Schubert as a replacement for the later missing aria. The musical copying and pasting works well enough, and Jacobs’ performance is never short on energy and atmosphere, with the period instruments of the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra, especially the natural horns, adding a nice edge of menace to the sound world. As that rare thing nowadays, a studio-made opera recording, Jacobs creates a very plausible piece of audio drama, though there’s sometimes the feeling that the soloists have been chosen as much for their ability to deliver the speech as for their singing; the dialogues certainly sound more natural, less arch, than they often do in Singspiel performances, but the musical performances – led by Maximilian Schmitt as Max, Polina Pasztircsák as Agathe, Yannick Debus as Kilian, and Christian Immler in the larger-than-usual role of the Hermit – do sometimes seem a little bland, when compared with other versions on disc. In a significant way, though, Jacob’s recording is really sui generis.",Arts/Music,Weber: Der Freischütz review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/28/weber-der-freischutz-review-rene-jacobs-freiburg-baroque-orchestra
4/28/2022,"Two years on from the first national lockdown, it’s fair to say that our working lives have been upended. What for years was deemed impossible has proved perfectly workable. Now, employees expect to mix virtual and in-person work and to spend roughly half their time in the office each week, according to recent analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), published by Virgin Media O2 Business. New ways of working – a mix of office-based, remote and flexible hours – could boost the UK’s GDP by 6.5% by 2040, the report reveals. Digital progress has undoubtedly been turbocharged by the pandemic, but hasty improvisations must now make way for longer-term arrangements. Employers are busy fathoming how to keep staff engaged and customers happy. So how can employers make hybrid work better? Remember the person behind the role – and have faithEmployers now have a greater understanding of their staff, and their goals, caring responsibilities, hobbies and struggles, as the last two years have revealed the individuals behind their roles. Building on those human relationships is now more crucial than ever. “Hybrid and blended working must be based on a culture of trust and empowerment, where managers allow staff to work in a way that is best for them,” says Prof Emma Parry of the Cranfield School of Management. “Presenteeism and employee surveillance have no place in a modern business,” said Prof Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University and previously the UK Treasury, on the Harvard Business Review podcast. “Judging by results rather than keystrokes is a smarter way to manage.” Don’t lose sight of true flexibilityDebate around hybrid working has been dominated by “where” rather than “when”, says Gemma Dale, HR expert and lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University Business School. Genuinely flexible hybrid working (including part-time working, job sharing and compressed hours) has the potential to bring nearly 4 million people “locked out” from work, such as parents, carers and disabled people, into the workforce. Enabling part-time workers to work more hours could add £48.3bn to the UK economy each year, according to the CEBR research. The study showed that, of the UK’s 8.6 million part-time workers, more than two-fifths (43%) would increase their hours if they could work remotely, and this could enable part-time workers to earn £3,600 a year of extra income. “Autonomy is great for motivation, for wellbeing – for employees saying what life they want,” says Dale. “The optimal benefits of hybrid will come when we can truly embrace asynchronous work.” While some jobs can’t be done from home, businesses can get creative around job shares, allowing staff to set their own rosters. “Employers need to consider how they plan work to ensure equity within the team and how to maintain communication and working relationships so productivity does not suffer,” says Parry. Find your office ‘why’Just as we ebb and flow during working hours, so does our desire to work from home or onsite – and employers must build in this flexibility. According to the most recent figures from the ONS, 85% of people say they want a hybrid approach to home and office working – but 32% of businesses are still unsure who will work where. “Some firms say they want a sense of team cohesion … a feeling that you are part of something,” says Bruce Daisley, host of acclaimed podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat, on The New Everyday podcast from Virgin Media Business. Some companies have decided they want “a moment where everyone is together”. Employees must also leave the office at the end of the day knowing why they went in – and they want more than gimmicks. No one wants to travel into their physical workplace simply to join online meetings all day. Managers could consult their teams directly to ask what they want from the office; could it be a learning or social activity that they’re after? “You need to think about how to pull employees in and make this feel like it has value. You need some open conversations,” says Dale. Listening to employees’ needs was identified by the recent Work After Lockdown (pdf) report as a key factor in successfully adopting hybrid working. “It’s crucial that employees feel heard,” says Jo Bertram, managing director at Virgin Media O2 Business. “It’s not only the right thing to do – it’s also good business sense. An engaged employee is far more likely to create a better customer experience than one who doesn’t feel listened to.” Managers must step up – and leave no one behindAfter a hybrid work meeting, says Bloom, it’s the remote attendees who miss out. “As soon as the meeting ends, the folks in the office close their laptops, walk out of the cubicle and talk to each other, probably go grab a coffee,” he told a Harvard Business Review podcast. And this creates an “in-group, out-group” hierarchy. “Mixed mode is really problematic,” he says. His research pre-pandemic found that promotion rates of those working at home were half those of staff who were in the office every day. “That’s an enormous effect … you could find a situation 10 years from now that people with young kids, particularly women, people with disabilities, people living farther away [who prefer to work from home] fall behind.” There are gains to be had for employees and employers alike – remote working allows employees to be more productive by two hours a day. But managing a hybrid team is harder than when everyone is working remotely. “Having managers who are capable of inspiring and motivating their teams from afar is going to be the differentiating skill,” says Daisley. Managers now need to become more organised and intentional in communicating, and bring a human touch online. Responsibility to ensure employees aren’t sidelined lies firmly with leaders. “[Managers] have got to make sure they have the right communication channels, the right policies in place, the right training,” says Holly Branson, head of vision at Virgin, in The New Everyday podcast. “They’ve absolutely got to make sure that we have equal opportunities for everyone.” Technology matters – and will matter even moreWe now know the importance of having the right kit and privacy at home, and employers must ensure staff have adequate connectivity and secure access to technology for the job. Companies must also reassess and adapt their physical and digital locations to allow staff to work better together, according to The Human Connection, a new report from Virgin Media O2 Business. Office layout, lighting and even furniture all matter, alongside technological advancements and insights. Businesses can use technology (location intelligence) to analyse how people use space and objects, while hybrid conferencing technology can draw in remote and physically present employees to collaborate better. Tech-savvy organisations have outperformed their peers during the pandemic. Businesses that embraced the likes of artificial intelligence, cloud and mobile technologies during the pandemic saw a six percentage point increase of average growth in revenue compared with their competitors. For larger businesses, the pandemic accelerated digital adoption by four years, and these changes are becoming permanent, says the CEBR report. “What we call ‘new ways of working’ are really much more than that,” says Bertram. “It might mean more time spent with families, the ability to attend your child’s musical concert, the chance to unearth an old or new passion, or perhaps getting in shape. “For businesses, there’s now an opportunity up for grabs. Employees expect more from where and how they work, so that they can have the best experience, and be empowered to do the best work. To meet these new expectations, we understand that our customers now expect more from us as a digital partner. We’re doing service differently so they can achieve more with their employees, and in turn for their customers.” It’s time to expect moreTo find out about how your organisation can thrive in this new era of employee expectations, read the Human Connection report from Virgin Media O2 Business",Connected thinking,Five things every employer should know about making hybrid really work,https://www.theguardian.com/connected-thinking/2022/apr/28/five-things-every-employer-should-know-about-making-hybrid-really-work
4/28/2022,"Hello, and Happy Thursday, I’ve been closely following the criminal case against Pamela Moses, who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote, for the last few months. But on Monday I met her in person for the first time. We were meeting just days after prosecutors announced they were dropping criminal charges against her, cancelling a scheduled court appearance where she was set to find out if they would retry her case. Even so, Moses insisted that she take me to visit the hulking criminal courthouse in downtown Memphis, a building simply known by its address, 201 Poplar. We went through security and walked downstairs into one of the courthouse’s main waiting areas, where electronic screens on the wall showed defendant names and where they stood on court dockets for the day. It was mostly empty, but on a normal day, Moses said, it’s crowded with Black people waiting to get their cases heard. She walked past a line of people waiting at a clerk’s office and asked a teller if a judge she knew was still around – he wasn’t. We took the elevator up to the seventh floor, which houses the courtroom where Moses’ case took place. When the doors opened, a sheriff’s deputy beamed, gave her a hug, and congratulated her on beating the case. “This man tried to kill me the first time he met me,” Moses said, laughing. She would later tell me he was one of the officers who took her into custody when the bail in her voting case was abruptly revoked in December. Now, she said, they were cool with each other. Back downstairs we ran into Kenneth Brashier, a lawyer Moses has known for a long time. He was beaming too and congratulated her. “Usually you have a cigar when you take a victory lap,” he told her. Moses said she’d take a victory lap once she changed Tennessee’s law around felon disenfranchisement. It was raining, so Moses and I spent the rest of the day driving around Memphis in her car. Waiting to pick up her son Taj from school, we talked about the case of Crystal Mason, the Texas woman appealing a five-year prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot while ineligible in 2016. Moses was stunned to learn Mason’s vote wasn’t even counted. She walked me through several of the criminal and other legal cases she’s been involved in, rattling off an encyclopedic knowledge of judges, lawyers, and other county officials. She’s outspoken and embraces her reputation as a bit of a troublemaker. “I’m like Rocky Balboa,” she said at one point with a laugh. When I asked her what would come next for her now that the voting case was over, she didn’t miss a beat. “I’m working on getting a man of out of prison who’s been there for 25 years,” she said. In her yard, she still has a sign up from her long shot 2019 mayoral campaign. It was that effort that prompted election officials to start investigating her voting eligibility. Earlier that morning, Moses had held a press conference at the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine motel, where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. It was the first time Moses had spoken about her case since the charges were dropped. Taj, 13, a tech whiz, helped set up two iPhones to stream the press conference. “I am so lucky to be here with my mom because I am blessed. Other children are not as fortunate as me to have their parents released and have their charges dropped,” he said. Moses said Tennessee should get rid of the form that people with felonies have to fill out if they want to vote, the document at the center of her case. Tennessee has one of the most confusing and harshest felon disenfranchisement policies in the country – more than 450,000 people, including more than 20% of the Black voting age population, can’t vote because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project. She told me she saw her case as an effort to intimidate Black voters. “When it comes to Black people in the south, whatever we do, if it’s wrong, you’ve got to pay for it,” she said. “If there was a white person and I got treated the way I did, I would be just as upset, but you don’t see white people getting treated like that.” Moses also rebuked Amy Weirich, the district attorney who prosecuted the case. Weirich put out a statement on Friday suggesting Moses bore responsibility for her long sentence because she did not take a plea deal. Moses said the statement showed how the prosecutor was determined to get a conviction: “It showed who she is: arrogant, wants to be right. I think it just sounded like she wanted to win.” A Weirich spokesman declined an interview request. Moses urged people to vote in the Democratic primary for district attorney, which is going on right now (two of the candidates, Linda Harris and Janika White, watched from the audience). Afterwards, during a lunch at a barbecue restaurant across the street, Moses encouraged other Tennessee voters to talk to Harris. At the press conference that morning, she mentioned that she had considered committing suicide while she was in jail last year. Later she told me it was connected to the shock of being abruptly taken into custody. “Going to jail is not a bad thing for somebody who’s been before. It’s a bad thing when you’re not expecting it,” she said. Snacking on a steady stream of Jolly Ranchers from her front cupholder as we drove around that afternoon, she pointed out what she sees as deep inequalities in Memphis. Near Graceland, we drove by what looked like a busy voting precinct. People vote there, she said, because there’s money and tourism. Further down the road, Moses pointed out the neighborhood had changed: many of the buildings were abandoned, a consequence, she said, of white flight. “There’s so many things wrong in Memphis,” Moses said. “How dare you waste our tax dollars, waste our time, waste our manpower, how dare you do that? That’s what most people can agree on.” Florida Republicans approved a congressional map that severely blunts Black political power in the state. There is already a legal challenge to the plan. The Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, approved a new law that creates a statewide office to investigate election crimes and imposes other new restrictions. New York’s highest court struck down the state’s congressional map, saying it was too severely distorted to benefit Democrats.",News/US news,My day with Pamela Moses after her charges were dropped | The fight to vote,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/28/pamela-moses-charges-dropped-fight-to-vote-newsletter
4/28/2022,"Getting online transformed Bernard Whitbay’s life. Suffering from poor health, the 72-year-old from Salford spent most of the last 18 months in isolation at home. Without basic IT skills, he couldn’t shop online or even make video calls to his grandchildren and became increasingly depressed. Then a friend put him in touch with Tech and Tea, a local digital skills project for the over-60s that taught him the basics. From not knowing how to send an email, Whitbay has gone on to become a tech coach to others in his local community. Whether it’s ordering a prescription, renewing a passport, or attending a job interview, so many aspects of day-to-day life can now be carried out online – but not by everyone. Despite the rapid pace of digital adoption during the pandemic, which has boosted the take-up of online services, the UK’s digital divide still prevents many people from accessing them. Ten million people in the UK lack the most basic digital skills, such as logging on to wifi or using email, and 1.5m households have no internet access, according to social charity the Good Things Foundation in its Building a Digital Nation report. People who are digitally excluded find it hard to participate in society and often suffer from increased loneliness and social isolation. “Digital inclusion is about people having equitable access to the internet, the skills to use it, and an understanding of the potential it has for their lives,” says Helen Milner, group chief executive at the Good Things Foundation. “The barriers include a lack of affordable access, digital devices that you can connect to the internet, and the very basic digital skills to use the internet. They also need to understand the relevance of the internet to their lives – many see it as simply people posting pictures of themselves on social media.” Initiatives such as the National Databank are tackling digital exclusion. Launched last July by Virgin Media O2 and the Good Things Foundation, it provides free mobile data to those who need it. Milner says: “Data poverty isn’t binary. You may have access some of the time, but not all of the time. You might be in and out of work and can only afford enough data to last half the month. With more mobile providers now on board, the National Databank is making 500,000 sim cards available, and that will support a lot of people affected by data poverty.” Community groups and local initiatives across the UK are also making an impact, with schemes that invite people, businesses and other organisations to donate old laptops and other electronic devices to be refurbished and distributed to locals in need. Free basic skills programmes are available to help people with no online experience to take their first steps into the digital world at their local library or community centre. Digital exclusion is largely a hyper-local problem – affecting lots of very small geographical communities – that requires a collaborative solution on a much larger scale. Challenges around connectivity, accessibility, affordability, skills, and motivation are being tackled through a series of public and private sector programmes and community initiatives in places such as Greater Manchester, where a pan-sector Digital Inclusion Taskforce was set up to tackle the digital divide. In 2020, a partnership between Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) and Virgin Media Business set out to deliver fibre optic connectivity to public sector sites throughout the city region. The £23.8m Local Full Fibre Networks (LFFN) programme connected more than 1,600 public sites. This has enabled local people to use the free connectivity in community spaces to access online services such as banking and GP appointments, take advantage of opportunities to develop digital skills, and learn how to use the internet safely. It has also given younger people more places to get online and complete their school work. The programme brought forward some of GMCA’s year-on-year investment in networks, technology and connectivity, and combined with the government funding that it had secured, created a bigger pot to deliver a greater reach and scale, for example, in the area of jobs and digital skills. “The number of IT jobs advertised in the region over the past 12 months increased by about 165%. With the digital connections we are making, people can see a route to these opportunities,” says Phil Swan, digital director of the GMCA. “Wherever people are based in Greater Manchester or any part of the north, they can see the growth of the region’s digital economy, they recognise the potential for new jobs, and thanks to new ways of working flexibly and remotely, people can more easily take advantage of them across the whole city region.” This collaboration between large public sector bodies, individual local authorities, private companies, charities, and countless hyper-local community organisations has created a blueprint for bringing connectivity to communities where digital exclusion has been deeply entrenched and had a profound impact on people’s lives. The LFFN programme also incorporates a number of social value initiatives, including the connection of 15 homeless shelters to the network. The move supports mayor Andy Burnham’s ambitions to tackle homelessness in Greater Manchester and provides a digital lifeline to some of society’s most digitally excluded individuals. Being online has become a necessity – people can’t take part in society if they are digitally excluded. But it isn’t just a bolt-on. It has to be mainstream in the day-to-day delivery of services, and accessible for everyone. A study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research and Virgin Media O2 Business found that remote working could open the door for almost 4 million people to enter the workforce, including 1.5 million disabled people, 1.2 million parents and 500,000 carers. Equipping more people with the tools and skills to get online will, in enabling them to be more connected and better informed, open up the whole country to the benefits of genuine digital inclusion. “Digital transformation has the power to go well beyond technology,” says Martin McFadyen, head of public sector at Virgin Media O2 Business. “In many cases, it can change people’s lives – bringing them the skills and support they need to thrive. But we won’t be able to achieve our full digital potential until everyone in the UK is able to get online. We are rightly in a new era of expectations, where it’s no longer enough to just ‘do business’, we need to do good.” It’s time to expect moreFind out how Virgin Media O2 Business is raising the bar on creating lasting social value with the public sector",Connected thinking,Tackling the digital divide: removing the barriers to online access for all,https://www.theguardian.com/connected-thinking/2022/apr/28/tackling-the-digital-divide-removing-the-barriers-to-online-access-for-all
4/28/2022,"While the Covid pandemic pushed the UK’s health and social care sectors to the brink, it became the catalyst for transformation of these areas on an unprecedented scale. Digital adoption may have been a knee-jerk response to the urgent need to free up capacity in acute hospitals and reduce the risk of infection transmission in NHS settings, but it has transformed patient care, supported staff in working remotely, and kept vital services running. As a result of Covid forcing through innovations in treatments and patient care, the pandemic has helped the healthcare sector make up lost ground, accelerating the rate of digital transformation in health and social care by up to five years, according to a recent study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) and Virgin Media O2 Business. Now, as the NHS strives to return to something like normality, the challenge will be maintaining the momentum of this digital revolution in a sector dogged by long-running battles with legacy technology. Historically, new digital projects have always been difficult to implement within the NHS, impeded by concerns over interoperability and security and budgetary constraints. “It normally takes a huge amount of time to get a new digital healthcare project off the ground,” explains Graham Walsh, chief clinical information officer at the Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS hospital trust and a practising knee surgeon. “With Covid, we had no choice. We were working remotely, we couldn’t see patients face to face, so we had to find solutions very quickly. And because of that, patients also adapted and adopted and saw the benefits really quickly.” Digital transformation has also facilitated the virtual management of patient care through remote monitoring. For example, Walsh’s patients can go home on day one following knee replacement surgery with a wearable sensor that monitors their range of motion, guides them through exercises, and logs their progress, enabling them to be self-directed in their rehabilitation. He says: “As a result, the physios no longer have to see every surgical patient; they just see the patients they need to see, which frees up clinical resources and hospital beds, and allows us to treat more patients.” Remote monitoring is also being used to improve patient care for long-term conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, using smartphone-based technology. At Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS foundation trust, where cardiologists are piloting digital devices to monitor their patients at home, the proportion of virtual work being done, including consultations and monitoring, has risen from 10% a year ago to more than 50%. Technology has helped ease some of the staffing pressures that threatened to overwhelm patient services during the pandemic. Many conditions that don’t require surgery can be managed with information and exercises facilitated by digital technology, removing clinical staff from the process. Digital solutions also improved work-from-home capabilities for staff, and provided the whole workforce, both frontline and back office, with greater flexibility during the most critical times of the pandemic. For Mike Smith, director of large enterprise and public sector at Virgin Media O2 Business, it goes beyond technology and connectivity – it’s about better patient care. “That could mean the difference between someone receiving the correct diagnosis in time, or health workers being able to access the information they need to save a life,” he says. A lasting legacy of the pandemic has been its impact on patient waiting times for elective and non-acute procedures and treatments. “The anger these patients feel isn’t so much about a long wait, but the not knowing,” says Walsh. “We’ve used technology to create a database that prioritises them according to their clinical needs, and also keeps them informed.” However, if the NHS, and health and social care organisations, are to build on what has been achieved in the past two years, there will need to be a more structured approach to shaping digital transformation around an even greater focus on how better patient outcomes can be maintained and improved. Felix Peckitt, a senior business consultant in BearingPoint’s healthcare practice, says: “Patients interact with healthcare systems at different touchpoints throughout their journey; calling their GP to get an appointment, attending A&E, picking up a prescription; activities that use different digital tools, which may not always talk to each other. “Patients also interact with many different hospitals and providers to get help; why should their systems not interact too? Connected systems can also help reveal patients who have got lost in the cracks, pinballing from service to service, without getting the support they need. Understanding this helps ensure that the digital transformation is patient-centred.” Unusable systems are being mothballed, while interoperability between digital healthcare systems has improved, building the foundations for technology to connect people’s homes to hospitals. This opens the door to more sophisticated technologies and analysis powered by advances in artificial intelligence and the computational capability of the cloud. For a better connected and more unified health sector, investment must be prioritised in digitising routine and high-volume processes that are high-impact and predictable, says Peckitt. “This frees up clinical professionals’ time to do what they do best, spending more time with patients and doing value-adding work.” While the NHS had seen rapid digitalisation recently, this hasn’t always been the case in partner organisations critical to patient care. There is a need for an integrated patient pathway, to ensure that key partners, such as care homes and palliative care providers, are part of the same digital journey. But innovation in healthcare across the UK is not always an even playing field, and organisations adopt digital technology at different rates. Creating greater uniformity will require greater investment in connectivity, collaboration, and technologies that enable equitable productivity and effectiveness for staff, and even better outcomes for patients across all areas of health and social care. It’s time to expect moreHow can health organisations benefit from a new era of better patient outcomes?

4/28/2022,"Energy companies in Germany and Hungary have confirmed they intend to comply with Vladimir Putin’s demand that buyers of Russian gas pay for contracts in roubles. But the EU has warned there is a risk the companies would be in breach of sanctions prohibiting transactions with Russia’s central bank. The stakes are high, because the Kremlin has already switched off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Putin said buyers from “unfriendly” countries must start paying for their gas in roubles. Usually, the vast majority of buyers would pay in euros or dollars. Their bill from Russia’s state energy group Gazprom would be deemed settled once the payment went through. Under decree 172, which he issued in March, buyers have to take part in a new payment system that requires the opening of two accounts at Gazprombank. Money would be paid into one account in euros and dollars before being converted by the bank into roubles and paid to Gazprom from the second account. Only at that point would the buyer be deemed to have fulfilled its legal obligation to pay for the gas. Hungary has said it is happy with the plan and, according to reports, two of Europe’s biggest gas companies, Germany’s Uniper and Austria’s OMV, are also reportedly preparing for rouble payments, while Italy’s Eni is said to be considering it. Until this week, it was unclear whether Putin would make good on his threat to cut off buyers who refuse his demand. But on Wednesday, Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Bulgargaz (Bulgaria) and PGNiG (Poland) after they declined to pay in roubles. This is where it gets thorny. European leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have said they would not do Putin’s bidding. The EU’s preliminary analysis, which was issued earlier this month, found that to do so would be a breach of sanctions imposed on the Kremlin. This is because the currency conversion process at the heart of it involves the Russian central bank, which is under sanctions. “As the conversion process may take an undefined amount of time, during which time the foreign currency is entirely in the hands of the Russian authorities including the central bank, it may even be considered as a loan granted by EU companies,” the commission said. On Thursday, EU officials confirmed that any company agreeing to open a rouble account in Russia and pay for gas that way would be in breach of sanctions. Possibly. According to further guidance issued by the EU last week, the Kremlin’s decree does not stop gas importers asking Gazprom to agree the purchase is legally complete once the first payment, in euros or dollars, has been deposited at Gazprombank. Any conversion into roubles would take place thereafter, meaning the buyer would not technically have breached sanctions. Another option, the guidance says, is for buyers to make a public declaration that they consider the purchase complete once their dollar or euro payment is made. The only obstacle to this, according to the guidance, is the need for “confirmation from the Russian side” that all of this complies with decree 172. In other words, Gazprom – or effectively the Kremlin – has to be on board. Gazprom and Gazprombank are not subject to EU sanctions, so buyers are permitted to negotiate such labyrinthine proposals without breaching sanctions. This apparent legal loophole significantly clouds the picture over the true nature of compliance with Putin’s demand. For instance, responding to reports that OMV was preparing to make rouble payments, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, insisted this was not the case. Putin’s “weaponisation” of Russian gas exports is part of a strategy designed to shore up the economy that was announced shortly after the war began. The decision by the west to impose sanctions prompted a sharp fall in the value of the rouble and increased the threat of hyperinflation. In response, Russia imposed strict capital controls under which exporting companies were forced to convert their foreign currency earnings into roubles. Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, said the capital controls had made the rouble a one-way bet for currency traders, helping to explain why it had recovered to its pre-invasion levels against the dollar. Peach said this week’s action against Poland and Bulgaria would not have a major economic impact on Russia. “European importers will continue to pay Gazprom bank in euros, which it will then convert into roubles. It doesn’t make a big difference,” he said. “Politically, Putin is trying to show Russia is standing up to sanctions and is able to apply a bit of pressure.” There are two possible explanations for this. The first is that payments in euros or dollars would add to Russia’s foreign currency reserves, which have been frozen since the start of the war. Payment in roubles for Russia’s gas supports the economy at a time when it is facing a deep recession. The second reason is that Russia has gradually been moving away from settlement in dollars and euros since it annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has been seeking to increase payments in roubles and yuans for its energy, and the war in Ukraine has accelerated that trend.",News/World news,Why are EU energy firms agreeing to pay for Russia’s gas in roubles?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/why-are-eu-energy-firms-agreeing-to-pay-for-russias-gas-in-roubles
4/28/2022,"Moldova is facing “a very dangerous new moment”, the country’s deputy prime minister has said, as he warned that unnamed forces were seeking to stoke tensions after a series of explosions in the breakaway region of Transnistria this week. In a briefing with journalists, Nicu Popescu said his government had seen “a dangerous deterioration of the situation” in recent days, after grenade attacks on the “ministry of security” in the breakaway region of Transnistria on Monday. The attacks with rocket-propelled grenades represented “a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region,”, he said, adding that Moldova’s institutions had been put on high alert in response. Fears are growing that Moldova and Transnistria could be drawn into the Ukraine conflict. The predominantly Russian-speaking region of Transnistria in eastern Moldova has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992 after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels. Last week a senior Russian commander said gaining control over southern Ukraine would help Russia link up with Transnistria, which shares a 453km border with Ukraine. Then on Monday came a series of mysterious explosions targeting Transnistria’s “state security ministry”, a radio tower and military unit. “Our analysis so far shows that there are tensions between different forces within the region interested in destabilising the situation and that makes the Transnistrian region vulnerable and creates risks for the Republic of Moldova,” said Popescu, who added that a majority of Moldovans, including those in Transnistria, wanted to stay out of the war. Moldova’s government, which does not control Transnistria, was working through several hypotheses about the cause of the attacks, he said, adding that it could be a provocation or “the result of some tensions of some forces inside this region”. He added: “We cannot point exactly the finger or put the blame, but what we see is that indeed there are some forces inside the region that work towards the destabilisation of the situation inside this region.” According to Popescu, who is also Moldova’s foreign minister, Transnistrian authorities announced last week they were stopping all men of fighting age from leaving the region, which he described as a sign that “we are not yet out of the potential danger zone”. Moldova had received public and private assurances from Moscow “that Russia continues to recognise the territorial integrity of Moldova”, he said, adding that “given the situation in the region, we remain very alert”. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on Thursday that recent incidents in Transnistria were an attempt to drag it into the conflict in Ukraine. Transnistrian authorities have blamed Ukraine for the attacks, while Kyiv has pointed the finger at Russia, saying Moscow is seeking to destablise the region. One senior EU diplomat said the incidents were “clearly prepared by Russia themselves”, a view that was based on their analysis of the situation, rather than intelligence sources. “We don’t see that there will be an active conflict”, the diplomat said, “but you never know because they [Russia] have done crazy things”. One of Europe’s poorest countries, Moldova is grappling with a large influx of refugees and the economic fallout of the war that has stopped nearly 15% of its exports. About 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have arrived in Moldova, equivalent to 3.5% of the population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry. While the number has stabilised and even decreased recently, the former Soviet country is still adapting to the new arrivals, with Ukrainian refugees now accounting for one in 10 of the child population in Moldova. The war is also having “major negative economic impacts”, Popescu said as up to 14% of Moldova’s exports, which had gone to Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, had “virtually stopped”. Inflation had shot up to 22% and the price of Moldova’s imports had gone up, as the nearby Ukrainian port of Odesa – the cheapest way to transport many goods – was no longer available. Moldova is seeking economic support from the EU, as well as eventual membership of the bloc. The government in Chișinău filed a membership application in March soon after Ukraine launched its bid to join the EU, and is busy answering hundreds of questions from Brussels about its readiness to join. Last week, Moldova’s government announced it had submitted to Brussels an initial questionnaire answering 369 questions; it is now working through a second document covering 2,000 other queries on the country’s compatibility with EU law. “We are a country with a European history, a European identity, a European language – and our Romanian language is already an official language of the EU, so that makes things much easier,” Popescu said, adding that Moldova had proven it was adept at changing governments through democratic means. But even EU member states sympathetic to Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia’s membership bids say these countries are unlikely to join anytime soon.",News/World news,Moldova facing ‘dangerous moment’ amid fears it could be drawn into Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/moldova-facing-very-dangerous-moment-amid-fears-it-could-be-drawn-into-ukraine-war
4/28/2022,"Poor decisions at the top seep down through all levels of a club. It is no coincidence that Everton’s men’s and women’s teams are suffering from a confused strategy and underwhelming performances. The two teams sit third from bottom in their respective divisions after high spending, poor recruitment and managerial changes – the women are on their third manager of the season. Rafa Benítez was brought in before the start of the season to manage the men’s side but after not having the desired impact was replaced after six and a half months by Frank Lampard. The two managers have very different styles, leaving questions to be asked of the long-term strategy. The Spaniard likes his teams to be disciplined and defensively rigid, whereas at Derby and Chelsea Lampard was known for an attacking philosophy where his teams tried to outscore the opposition. At Everton Lampard has needed to adapt to the players available to him – we’ve seen them against Manchester City and Liverpool operate in a style not previously witnessed but needs must at the business end of the season. Benítez and Lampard have been hamstrung by past mistakes. Everton have spent more than £500m on players since Farhad Moshiri bought the club in 2016 but that level of expenditure is over. Last summer Demarai Gray was purchased for £1.5m and all Benítez’s other signings were free transfers. Previous recruitment saw £25m and £29m spent on Yannick Bolasie and Moise Kean respectively, without long-term success. Everton were in a position in January where they could not get the players they needed because they had bought wrongly previously. All Everton need do is look over the road to Anfield, where they have spent less but targeted the right people who have made an impact. If you do not get your strategy right, it will eventually come back to haunt you. Everton’s men are bottom of the away form table, securing six points all season on the road. I do not know if it’s a tactical thing – whether they set up very differently and it has not worked – or whether they have such a good crowd at Goodison that it inspires the players and they cannot get to the level when not at home. There will be a lot of factors but that is not good enough and it is relegation form. Norwich have a better record, which says it all. You cannot rely on your home form to get 40 points. There could also be a psychological barrier: players will read those stats and will feel better at Goodison and it will filter through the squad. On the women’s side Everton invested heavily in the summer with the intention of challenging for a top-three Women’s Super League finish. The reality is they are seeing out the final games of the season with an interim manager. Willie Kirk was sacked five matches into the campaign after two wins and three losses. Those defeats came against Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, arguably the best teams in the league. I do not know what they expected of Kirk in those fixtures. Kirk’s replacement, Jean-Luc Vasseur, offered a different style, having managed Lyon, where he was used to working with galácticos of the women’s game and won a Champions League. The Frenchman lasted 10 games at Everton. He tried to put his ideas into a squad that was not of the same standard as Lyon’s, so his methods did not work and nor were they given time to. It raises more questions about strategy when a manager is sacked after such a short time. Changing manager regularly is unsettling and creates instability. The women’s team are safe but they will just want to get to the summer and await Brian Sørensen taking the reins. If players are going to the Euros they will look forward to a break and hope to hit the ground running on their return. The men will be fighting hard to stay up, desperately hoping results go their way, so they can refresh and rebuild under Lampard. What happens on the men’s side has an impact on the women, and vice versa. When I was at Arsenal the men’s team were really happy for us when we did well and there was banter if we had done better than they had in certain seasons. It was the same at Chelsea; when the men were winning we were really proud and if we were winning they were really proud. David Luiz put on a massive celebratory meal for us at his restaurant because he was really happy for us after we won the double in 2018 and invited us all down. I felt massively part of the club – it was not the men’s and women’s teams, it was Arsenal, it was Chelsea – and I was really proud of it. If things are not going well, it can have a negative result on both. If Everton’s men go down it could affect the finances of both sides, which should be of great concern if the women feel the impact. As the errors of the past bite Everton, they will need a clear strategy for the summer. The short-term goal is to ensure the men stay in the Premier League but the planning for the long term needs to be less muddled, otherwise Everton risk repeating their mistakes.",Sport/Football,Everton’s confused strategy has infected both their men’s and women’s teams | Karen Carney,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/everton-confused-strategy-has-infected-mens-and-womens-teams
4/28/2022,"The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year, contracting by -0.4% in the first quarter, or -1.4% on an annualized basis, its weakest quarter since the early days of the pandemic. Economic growth slowed markedly at the start of the year. In the last three months of 2021 US gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of the economy – grew by 1.7% or 6.9% on an annualized basis. The Commerce Department said the slowdown was caused by a rise in imports and a drop in private inventory investment, exports, federal government spending, and state and local government spending. Consumer spending, the largest component of the US economy, grew 0.7% in the first quarter – a 2.7% annual rate – despite the impact of the Omicron wave of the coronavirus. The latest report was worse than economists had expected and was compiled as the war in Ukraine triggered oil price rises that are still working their way through the economy and before China imposed new coronavirus lockdowns that may worsen supply chain issues. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, called the drop “unexpectedly severe”. But he said it was unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as it attempts to tackle rising inflation. The Fed raised rates in March as inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.9%. It meets next week and is expected to raise rates once again. Fed chair Jerome Powell has suggested the central bank may raise rates by 0.5 percentage points, twice March’s rise. “The unexpectedly severe 1.4% annualised decline in first-quarter GDP growth probably won’t stop the Fed from hiking interest rates by 50 basis points next week, since officials will chalk it up to the temporary impact of Omicron and point to the strength of underlying demand,” Ashworth wrote in a note to investors. The surprise drop in growth comes as other sectors of the US economy remain strong. Employers have added an average of 600,000 new jobs a month over the last six months and the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in March, close to its pre-pandemic low.",News/Business,US economy saw ‘unexpectedly severe’ drop in first three months of year ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/us-economy-saw-unexpectedly-severe-drop-first-quarter
4/28/2022,"The government has acknowledged that processing problems within the Home Office have led to delays between the approval of visas for Ukrainian refugees and emailed notification that the visas have been granted – preventing many vulnerable people from swiftly making their way to safety. Politicians from all parties highlighted a variety of serious problems with the Homes for Ukraine visa scheme during an urgent question in the Commons on the Home Office’s handling of the refugee crisis. Latest figures show that just one in five of those issued visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme had arrived in the UK. MPs suggested that the relatively small number of people travelling was the consequence of visas not being issued to family units simultaneously, with approval of children’s visas often taking several weeks longer. About 86,000 visas have been issued to people fleeing Ukraine under the government’s two Ukraine refugee schemes (the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme) but just 27,100 have travelled to the UK. Of the51,300 visas issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, only 11,000 have actually arrived in the UK. The Home Office minister Kevin Foster dismissed as nonsense reports that there was a deliberate Home Office policy to withhold children’s visas. “I am aware of the claims that have been made, the false claims I have to say, that there is a deliberate move to withhold individual visas. Those are absolute nonsense,” he told the Commons. But he admitted there were bureaucratic issues which meant refugees were not immediately receiving emails informing them that the visas had been granted. “We have been aware of an issue with the way the current system is working, in terms of the decision being made and then needing to be dispatched,” he said. It has been clear for a number of weeks that there are serious delays between visas being approved and refugees receiving emails telling them they have permission to travel. This is understood to be the result of a workflow backlog between two separate teams of civil servants, with one group responsible for visa decisions and another group, based elsewhere, in charge of communicating those decisions. Foster said there was a separate team working on “ensuring dispatch”, but said the government was working on creating “a fully online”, automated system next month, which would “resolve that particular issue”. The shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock said there was widespread frustration at the speed with which refugee casework was being processed, adding: “For too many, the hotline has gone stone cold.” Numerous MPs said delays in issuing visas were causing refugees to run out of money, exposing them to homelessness and a variety of other dangers while they waited for the UK government to grant their visas. Stuart McDonald, the Scottish National party’s Home Office spokesperson, said the government had erected “a massive wall of bureaucracy and red tape” which was “causing totally avoidable misery for Ukrainians fleeing war”, and called for the visa regime to be scrapped. Fellow SNP MP Deirdre Brock highlighted the case of Yulia, a primary school teacher from Kharkiv who has been waiting more than a month for her two-year-old daughter’s visa to be granted. She was told earlier this week that the visa had been granted, and travel documents would be issued in a couple of days. “But the child’s mother had been phoned by mistake as it was, in fact, someone else’s visa that had been granted, and it would take around another two weeks for the right visa to come through. These folks are, in effect, homeless,” she said. “Each day the message that they are welcome in the UK fades a little more.” Andrew Saunders, who has offered to sponsor Yulia and her daughter, Diana, said: “From start to finish it has been a staggeringly incompetent and inappropriate process – it was meant to take three to five days but we are more than a month in and we still await the visa for the two-year-old.” Yulia, who asked for her surname not to be printed, said she was puzzled by the need to conduct protracted checks before issuing a visa to a two-year-old. After a month in Germany, she said, she was running out of money, and her daughter was increasingly unsettled. “I am feeling really upset and frustrated. We have already stayed in four places and we have to move again this weekend so I’m looking for a fifth place to stay. I feel powerless.” A government spokesperson said: “We are processing thousands of visas a day – this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we’ll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.”",News/Politics,UK government admits to processing delays for Ukraine visas,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/government-admits-bureaucratic-issues-causing-homes-for-ukraine-visa-delays
4/28/2022,"Before this week, 56 MPs – including two shadow cabinet ministers – had reportedly been referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), a parliamentary watchdog established more than three years ago. The profile of the ICGS has been heightened after news that a Conservative MP, who allegedly watched pornography on his phone in the House of Commons, has been reported to it. The scheme was set up as an independent process with cross-party backing as a result of the #MeToo movement and after figures including Sir Michael Fallon and Charlie Elphicke faced allegations relating to sleaze and sexual misconduct. Its function is also to process official HR complaints. It consists of a number of codes, including parliament’s sexual misconduct policy, and had its scope expanded in 2019 to cover historic cases. An extension of her remit has allowed Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards (PCS), to oversee investigations and make findings in cases against MPs under the ICGS. The ICGS applies to everyone working on, or visiting, the parliamentary estate. Complaints to a helpline are assessed by an external independent investigator. If the complaint meets the criteria under the scheme, an external independent investigator will carry out a full investigation. Complaints against MPs or MPs’ staff are investigated by external independent investigators. Complaints against members of the House of Lords, or Lords members’ staff, are investigated by the independent House of Lords commissioner for standards. An independent expert panel (IEP), which does not include MPs, decides appeals and determines sanctions in complaints against MPs of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct under the ICGS. The ICGS says it has investigated more than 100 cases concerning bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct since July 2018. Most investigations are not made public, though seven cases involving accusations against MPs, which were considered by an IEP, have been made public. Three of the cases involving the behaviour of John Bercow, the former Speaker of the House of Commons, were part of an IEP report in March which upheld 21 out of 35 complaints against him by former staff and colleagues. The original idea was that the ICGS would cover normal HR matters, including sexual harassment and bullying, leaving the PCS to cover behaviour relating to the role of MPs, such as lobbying. However, critics have suggested there has been some crossover. One MP told Conservative Home that the PCS has started picking up cases theoretically covered by the ICGS, thereby “gold-plating” its punishments rather than policing a different class of behaviour. An 18-month review into the scheme by the HR director Alison Stanley found “much progress” had been made, but raised concerns about equal access for diverse groups and processes that had become “over complex”. She said there was “a perception among some that it is a stressful, isolating and very lengthy process”. Jo Willows, the ICGS director, said last month that 28 of Stanley’s 33 recommendations had been implemented.",News/Politics,What is role of parliamentary watchdog ICGS set up in response to #MeToo?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/what-is-role-parliamentary-watchdog-icgs-set-up-in-response-metoo
