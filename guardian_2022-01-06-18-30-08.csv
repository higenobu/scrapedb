1/6/2022,"US troops in Okinawa prefecture have been ordered to wear masks off base amid criticism that military authorities failed to tackle a fresh Covid-19 outbreak among service personnel that has taken hold among the local civilian population in Japan. Okinawa is at the centre of the country’s latest outbreak, with cases surging in recent days from 51 on Saturday to at least 980 on Thursday – a record daily caseload for the southern island.  Those figures omit infections among American troops but include those among Japanese citizens who work at US bases. The mask requirement came after the foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, called for US personnel to be confined to their bases in a telephone call with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Hayashi “strongly requested the strengthening of measures to prevent an expansion in infections”, according to Japan’s foreign ministry, adding that he had asked Blinken to consider restricting outings by US troops “to ease worries among local residents”. The chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said he was “gravely concerned” about outbreaks at American military facilities. Japan’s government is poised to announce new Covid-19 measures in Okinawa in the coming days after a request on Thursday from its governor. “If we all work together, we hope cases will come down,” Denny Tamaki told reporters on Thursday. Tamaki said this week he was “furious” at US military authorities over the “alarming rise” in cases – including those involving the Omicron variant – on Okinawa, host to more than half of the 47,000 American soldiers based in Japan. The expected quasi-state of emergency in Okinawa could include shorter opening hours for bars and restaurants. Tamaki has promised financial aid for businesses that comply with the restrictions. The measures would be the first in Japan since late September, when restrictions were lifted after a dramatic fall in new Covid-19 infections. Officials in Hiroshima prefecture said they would also request a quasi-state of emergency. The mask requirement for US military personnel – in a country where most people voluntarily wear face coverings – will reportedly apply to other US bases in Japan, home to more than 100,000 service members, dependents and contractors. Late last year, Japan banned all overseas arrivals apart from Japanese citizens and returning foreign residents in an attempt to prevent the spread of Omicron. But US soldiers are able to enter the country and move about freely under a bilateral security agreement. US Forces in Japan (USFJ) has reported a total of 1,784 cases among personnel and their families, with about a third of them in Okinawa. The Iwakuni marine corps base in south-western Japan has reported 529 cases. USFJ said personnel must test negative for Covid-19 before leaving their base, adding that masks must also be worn on base until a negative test result is confirmed. Until recently, the US military did not adhere to Japan’s policy of testing incoming travellers for the virus on arrival and requiring them to quarantine for two weeks. The USFJ said it “now requires no less than three negative Covid-19 tests upon travelling to Japan” including one within 24 hours of arrival. “The mitigation measures we have instituted throughout USFJ are intended to protect our force’s readiness, the wellbeing of our families, and the health of Japan’s citizens,” it said. “We recognise we all have a part to play in keeping our communities safe.” Japan’s infection rate remains comparatively low, with just over 2,600 cases reported on Wednesday. But the numbers are rising, and Wednesday marked the first time that cases had exceeded 2,000 for more than three months.

1/6/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open journey started in comfort, and excitement. A photo showed the tennis star with a huge grin on his face, bags packed, as he boarded his Emirates flight from Dubai.  “Let’s go 2022!” he posted to Instagram. But it ended with him trapped in an immigration hotel infamous for detaining refugees, caught in the middle of a diplomatic stoush between Serbia and Australia and a fight over his deportation playing out in the federal court. The news that the world No 1, who refuses to reveal his vaccine status, was en route to Australia enraged many. Melbourne was one of the most locked down cities in the world, and the Covid vaccine is mandated in the majority of its workplaces. Many residents questioned why Tennis Australia and the Victorian government were allowing an unvaccinated sports star to play. There are 1000s of people - fully vaccinated - who haven’t been able to get to see family members and loved ones in Australia because of travel restrictions still in place. But someone who refuses the vaccine is granted an exemption. Odd messaging. #Djokovic https://t.co/t3Gx1hOpXb Such a slap in the face to the Australian people to allow #Djokovic a vaccine exemption after what so many people endured here over the past two years. Australians weren’t even allowed to come home from overseas but apparently if you’re rich and famous, the rules don’t apply Anyone else hope the unvaccinated #Djokovic is put straight on an aircraft back home? I share the disgust of many Australians at his selfish arrogance and covid recklessness, assuming he has no genuine clinical reason for refusing the jab. #DjokovicOut This is spitting in the face of everyone who’s been dealing with separated families, border closures, snap lockdowns. At a time when testing is cooked, RATs are nowhere to be found and the feds are doing nothing to help. #Novak #Djokovic is not welcome. Fuck off. #AusOpen But after touching down in Melbourne about 11.30pm local time, Djokovic never made it through arrivals. Australian Border Force officials stopped him after it emerged that his team had applied for a visa that does not allow medical exemptions. In a statement, the ABF confirmed Djokovic did not meet the entry requirements and his visa was cancelled. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia,” the statement said. As Djokovic waited alone in an airport room, the arrivals lounge filled up with media and a small number of fans. One stood in the middle of the arrival gate, waving a Serbian flag. Slobodan Bendjo and Krstomir Dusanovic had been waiting at Melbourne airport since midnight, ready to welcome the tennis star. Armed with an accordion and a Serbian flag, the pair were walking around the airport playing music. “We are here to await the champion,” Dusanovic said. They were not deterred by the fact the tennis star was being told to leave Australia, they said. These two have become big hits in the arrivals lounge. pic.twitter.com/Jjd7l3jkYW And I’ve got one young #djokovic fan here who came out to the airport to show his support after his visa got cancelled.Andrew Mitrovic made a Free Noel sign.“I’m very disappointed.” pic.twitter.com/hvYzhNtQdg “We’ve still here to welcome him,” Bendjo said. “He’s just here somewhere behind these walls – he’s not far away from us. “We always, when he comes here, welcome him with music. It’s a traditional thing you do. We think it’s important we continue with the tradition.” A young fan, Andrew Mitrovic wandered in with his mum. He held a makeshift sign that said “free Nole”. They had brought tickets to see Djokovic play and were devastated he hadn’t been allowed in. About 10am, he was moved to the Park hotel in Carlton, an infamous immigration detention hotel. It houses 36 refugees – some of whom have been detained for nine years. The windows in the hotel can’t be opened – they have been sealed shut and there was recently a Covid outbreak among the detainees. An unusual crew of Djokovic supporters, refugee advocates and anti-vaxxers gathered outside the hotel. The hotel where #Djokovic has been sent is also holding asylum seekers who’ve been detained for more than 8 years by #Australia @AzimiMoz spent more than 15 months locked up there & in another Melbourne hotel with limited access to fresh air👇🏼 https://t.co/u1UtHBNP2q Husband and wife Ziggy and Billy Misovic came down to show their support for the tennis star. Waving a flag from Djokovic’s home town, Belgrade, they yelled “free Novak”. “We came to support the number one,” Billy said. “It’s ridiculous, he’s got an exemption, why not let him in?” Asked about his vaccination status, Ziggy said: “It’s a private matter. Do I ask if you have Aids? It’s private.” Billy said they understood the frustration of Victorians but that Djokovic had been “humiliated”. “My father passed away two years ago. He was in Serbia. The borders were closed, I understand [the frustration],” she said. Refugee Advocate Jenny Leah said she came every day to show her support and had never seen this many members of the media. “There are dozens of media here today, we are here every day – we get a lot of support from passing motorists, tram drivers, but never any media,” she said. “To us, it says something about the priorities of the media, and public.” The refugees are not allowed on the roof for fresh air and have recently reported finding maggots and mould in their food. Some of them have recently been released on bridging visas but the future of those left inside is unknown. Leah said Djokovic would receive very different treatment: “He’ll get to leave.” As the afternoon wore on, a slow stream of Djokovic’s supporters from Australia’s Serbian community came out to show their solidarity. They played Serbian music, danced and one zoomed around on a scooter yelling. Djokovic supporters are now dancing outside the Park Hotel. pic.twitter.com/lfsR40DeFC Hectic scenes outside the hotel where Djokovic supporters are addressing the media scrum - with refugee advocates behind them. pic.twitter.com/pLjGHQt5xv I absolutely adore Djokovic as a player but I disregard his stand on nota taking vaccine. His single step can demotivate a lot of his fans to not take vaccine. Great decision by australia.#Djokovic Sandra Milisic, draped in a Serbian flag, said Djokovic deserved “respect”. “If this was an issue to begin with, they should have knocked him back beforehand. He deserves the respect, considering he has given support to Australia during the bushfires,” she said. During a lull in festivities from Djokovic supporters, refugee advocates climbed on top of the roof and, with huge banners, chanted “free the refugees”. A refugee in the window above them holds up nine fingers, for the number of years he has been detained. One Djokovic supporter cut through the crowd to say: “I feel so ignorant. I came here for him, and find out they’ve been locked up for nine years. It’s so wrong.”",Sport/Sport,‘We await the champion’: how Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open trip went from elation to detention,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/06/we-await-the-champion-how-novak-djokovics-australian-open-trip-went-from-elation-to-detention

1/6/2022,"François Truffaut’s sublime autobiographical debut is now rereleased, a portrait of the artist as an unhappy child. He deserved every prize going simply for those heartstopping images of the children’s faces as they watch a Punch and Judy show. This is its first release in the UK since 2009, but maybe 62 years is now enough perspective to see fully how the grim scenes of home life and school life, which would have been accepted as contemporary realism in 1959 and for years afterwards, now look like historical documents. The title itself, from faire les quatre cent coups, means to hand out punishment, raise hell, sow wild oats – but this is an ironic upending. Truffaut’s alter ego, Antoine Doinel, is receiving the blows. They rain down on him. Cruelty and humiliation and desperation – and defiance – are this kid’s destiny.  Jean-Pierre Léaud played the 12-year-old lead in this and the five successive Doinel films, a role which was to define his entire life. Like Truffaut, Doinel is a truant, a delinquent, a kid from an unhappy home and a thief: he steals money, a bottle of milk, a typewriter and, most importantly of all, a piece of writing. For a class assignment, he plagiarises, or at any rate paraphrases, a passage from Balzac’s Quest of the Absolute from 1834, about the death of the alchemist Balthazar Claes, repurposing it for the supposed death of his own grandfather. Doinel even has a candlelit shrine to Balzac in the cramped family apartment, which almost burns the place down. But Doinel has a tyrannical and narrow-minded schoolteacher (veteran player Guy Decomble, resembling Maigret with his coat and pipe) who is nicknamed petite feuille – little leaf – and is a petty little pedant. Instead of applauding Doinel’s good taste and even conceding that this semi-larceny shows audacity and imagination, this man is simply satisfied with his own cleverness at spotting the borrowing and punishes the boy. It is the ultimate mortification. Doinel knows that his mother, the brassy Gilberte (Claire Maurier), is unfaithful to his jokey, affectionate stepfather Julien (Albert Rémy); he has seen her kissing a man in the street and knows that gifts of money may be involved. So when he pretends that his mother is dead as a bizarre excuse to explain one truancy – a grotesque lie for which Julien comes to school with his still living mother and slaps Doinel’s face in front of his class – it is clearly an act of matricidal wish-fulfilment of some sort. Doinel bunks off school, roaming all around town and of course going to the movies. But despite what is perpetually written about The 400 Blows, movies are not overwhelmingly important to Doinel. They do not “save” him the way they really did save the young cinephile Truffaut, whose friendship and mentorship with critic and intellectual André Bazin meant that he was spared dire punishment for desertion during national service. Doinel spends more of his time ranging far afield outside the cinema: in real life, in the streets of Paris. But there is one in-joke: his parents take him to the movies to see Jacques Rivette’s Paris Belongs to Us (which was not actually released until 1961, two years after The 400 Blows).Maybe Doinel is Truffaut’s alternative-reality version of himself: a self without the redemption of cinema, his abortive Balzac homage standing for the loss of art. With Gilberte’s shrugging permission, Doinel is sent to juvenile detention, put in police custody with grownup criminals and ladies of the night and then the psychological “observation unit” out in the country near the coast. That brings us to the final, almost apocalyptic scene on the beach, where Doinel has ended up after running away from reform school. We know that he has never seen the sea. So how does he feel on seeing it now the first time? Does it look like freedom to him? Or another blank wall? When Truffaut freeze-frames on Doinel’s face at the very end, it shows him looking careworn and haggard for the first time: the freeze-frame has captured the moment at which the boy has become a man. This is the 401st blow – aimed at us.  The 400 Blows is released on 7 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The 400 Blows review – François Truffaut’s coming-of-age masterwork,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/06/the-400-blows-review-francois-truffaut
1/6/2022,"Each page of Sara Freeman’s debut novel holds a slim paragraph, two at most. And if there are two paragraphs on one page, then these are divided by the symbol of a crescent moon, so that at no point is any section of text close to touching another. At all moments, the writing in Tides has to contend with an expanse of vacant space. The experience of reading such a novel is like travelling through a series of expertly designed studio flats. You marvel at every interior you come to: a whole unto itself, not a foot wrong in the design. But then you turn the page and enter yet another four walls, the last beginning to fade from your mind. Only at the end are you able to conceive of all these paragraphs at once, imagine a whole tower block of crafted text. Prior to the novel’s start, Mara, the main character, underwent the tragedy of a stillbirth. After that, she could no longer endure any of the relationships that bordered that terrible experience – not with her husband, nor her brother, his wife and their new baby, who lived on the floor below her apartment, “their joy so firmly lodged beneath her grief”. And so she boards a bus that will take her far away, to an American seaside town: 2,353 inhabitants, a few shops, hostels, then the bay and the water beyond that. For much of the novel, she drifts from place to place, staying at various hostels, spending nights passed out blind drunk on the beach or with strange men – before she finds more permanent residence in the disused attic of a wine shop, where she has got herself a temporary job.  Freeman’s chosen form, then, acts as a visual manifestation of her protagonist’s state: her refusal of proximity, her abnegation of all those people and places that had previously been contiguous to her life. Now, nothing can touch her, nothing must last. All the places she ends up in feel as interstitial as the paragraphs themselves, the attic “a square of dispossessed land” from which, after each night, “she sets to work on erasing the signs of her own presence”. This mirroring of structure and plot is smart. It can be very effective. But it also feels too artificial, too neat, to the extent that it draws attention away from the plot and towards its own ingenuity. It is an example of American literary critic and poet Yvor Winters’s “fallacy of imitative form”, his attack on modernist poetry wherein the “form succumbs to the raw material of the poem”, weakening both the poem’s ability to convey its meaning and the form itself. Freeman has suggested that Tides started as an exploration of intense sibling relationships and the way these come to seem abnormal if they continue into adulthood. As children, Mara and her younger brother Paul were inseparable (character names, as well as events occurring before the time of the novel, are drip-fed to the reader, Mara’s life a landscape under fog gradually burning away until the past is at last a clear day). Paul’s first word was “Mara”. Hers was “mine”. She carried him everywhere she went. As such, Mara has found it hard to accept Paul’s marriage, the way “every bit of life has been collectivised, their knowing too. Two skulls pressed together: two wills collapsed.” The subtle violence of the imagery perfectly expresses her abject horror at seeing her brother wrenched from her and becoming conjoined with another. Throughout Tides, there is play between singular and plural pronouns – Mara’s fear of becoming a “we” once more, and her equivalent terror at remaining an “I”. The slow revelation of the depth to which Paul and Mara were previously enmeshed is the strongest, most disturbing aspect of the book, and what makes it live in spite of its fragmented form. Freeman hammers her paragraphs down into perfected, indivisible units, without any bulk or extraneous matter. When it works, her images are light as gas. Naturally, there is an abundance of water-related imagery. After several months in the town, Mara realises no one has come to save her. “The fact solidifies beneath her, a layer of black ice under every thought.” And then, as she begins to come back to herself, in part because of a relationship with someone new, “there is summer right beneath, a current of it under a thin layer of ice”. This lover describes to her the inner workings of the tides, their “rush and release of water”, but she knows what she will remember from the conversation is not the tides’ mechanism, but “the tendon in his neck straining as he talks, the clavicle lifting like a lock”. Each image is eloquently expressed, but when it becomes the only thought on a page, without other images to jostle against, it loses its vitality. In a 2010 interview, Don DeLillo described how he limits himself to one paragraph per page when drafting his novels. It allows him to see more clearly the shape of the words. But in their final form, those paragraphs are brought back into colloquy with one another. As with stanza breaks, readers intuitively make something of these divisions; they do not require the separation of a whole page to understand the rupture that might have occurred in time, in thought, in feeling. In Tides, the splitting of paragraphs between pages does not become more than a formal pretension, one that slows down and makes less coherent an otherwise very strange and poignant novel.

1/6/2022,"Last year the player empowerment movement that has swept across sports finally arrived in the huddle. Quarterbacks throughout the NFL started to flex their power. Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson, Matthew Stafford, and Deshaun Watson all suggested (or demanded) trades; all four were stars at the peak of their powers. It will be much the same this summer. Rodgers, Wilson and Watson will be joined in trade discussions by Kirk Cousins and Matt Ryan, and the domino effect of any moves will be felt around the league.  Some decisions have already been reported. The Giants are intent on riding the Joe Judge-Daniel Jones partnership over the waterfall. The Dolphins have been the most active team in pursuit of Watson. If that plan comes to nothing, they will continue to build around Tua Tagovailoa. The Falcons should stick with Ryan, rather than jumping into a rebuild of their own. That leaves seven (obvious) quarterback-needy teams heading into the offseason: The Broncos, Browns, Saints, Panthers, Steelers, Lions, and Saints. So, let’s play pin the trade on the quarterback – a quick note that these are fun trades we think should happen rather than ones we think will happen. Aaron Rodgers to the Denver Broncos Who knows what Aaron Rodgers will do? He could stay with the Packers. He could walk away from the game altogether. Most likely: He pushes through a trade away from Green Bay. Let’s take a step back to understand exactly how bonkers that is. Rodgers is on his way to winning back-to-back MVPs. He’s playing the best all-around football of his career, balancing his tap-dancing style with Matt LaFleur’s carefully choreographed system. And yet, there’s a chance that he may not play the sport next season. And there’s an even stronger chance that if he does play, it will not be in Green Bay. And this is because the Packers front office drafted Jordan Love in 2020 without consulting their Hall of Famer and refused to allow further roster input (this despite the Packers front office putting together an excellent roster and coaching staff around Rodgers). It has a whiff of Yoko sitting on the amp about it. The Broncos have the kind of supporting cast that could convince Rodgers to ditch the Packers, particularly if Green Bay fall short in the playoffs again. Plus, the Broncos are likely to have a head coach opening, which would allow Rodgers to handpick his own man in Colorado. Denver also have the assets to further upgrade their roster. They hold five picks in the first three rounds and have bundles of cap room. Could Denver swing a double deal to pinch Davante Adams, the game’s top receiver, away from Green Bay, too? It’s plausible. Russell Wilson to the Cleveland Browns The Russell Wilson-Pete Carroll dynamic has reached breaking point. One of them will leave this offseason. Maybe both. There remains a scenario in which the Seahawks pick Wilson over Carroll, only for the quarterback to say he wants out regardless. If Wilson opts to push for a trade, there’s no better fit than the Browns. Cleveland can mimic the style of offense that brought Wilson success early in his career, while releasing enough of the handbrake to allow Russ to – yes – cook. Add to that, the Browns are loaded. Injuries and Covid issues have sapped the roster throughout this season, but there is star-level talent at every single position throughout the roster and they have as much depth as any team in the league, all under contract heading into next season. Russell Wilson 2.0 – he of his last 25 starts – has developed into a similar kind of player to Baker Mayfield: he’s risk-averse and lacks the dynamism of his early years. But he’s also ruthlessly efficient, someone who can run the same style of run-centric offense but can do so at a higher level and with more out-of-structure upside. If it’s all about winning, Wilson to the Browns makes the most sense for both sides. The Rams’ deal to send two first-round draft picks, a third round pick, and Jared Goff to the Lions in exchange for Matthew Stafford will likely send the benchmark for any future quarterback deals with potential MVP candidates. The Browns could look to recoup some value by moving Baker Mayfield elsewhere, or including him in the deal with Seattle to chip some draft picks off the overall price. And speaking of Mayfield … Baker Mayfield to the New Orleans Saints There exists a world in which the Browns and Mayfield find a compromise. We’ve yet to see a young quarterback play out a lame-duck fifth-year on his rookie-scale deal since the NFL moved to its new contract system. Mayfield could be the first. Injuries comprised Mayfield’s prove-it year, and there’s little to no chance Cleveland opt to give him a long-term extension. Yet if the Browns are able to snag an upgrade, Mayfield will be out. In that scenario, it will be fascinating to see what his market looks like. His impressive 2020 season is fresh enough in the memory that somebody will talk themselves into trading for Mayfield, perhaps with a long-term, affordable contract tied to the deal. The Saints make sense. Sean Payton has squeezed all the juice out of the Saints’ talent-laden roster this season. One of the league’s best rosters has been hamstrung by brutal quarterback play. Mayfield may not be the long-term answer, but he would represent an upgrade over Taysom Hill and Jameis Winston at this stage in their careers. Kirk Cousins to the Carolina Panthers Cousins will account for (avert your eyes) $45m on the Vikings’ books next season. Forty-five! With just one year left on his free-agent deal, there’s little wiggle room for the Vikings to manipulate the cap number, unless, of course, they commit to the kind of long-term deal that would cause two-thirds of Minnesota to faint. This year represented the final ride of the Mike Zimmer-Kirk Cousins axis. With the duo failing to make the playoffs, the Vikings are staring down a hard reset. If Minnesota can trade Cousins early in the offseason, they will reduce his gaudy cap hit to $10m. Enter the Panthers. Carolina owner David Tepper is infamously impatient. Carolina took swings at all of the big available quarterbacks last offseason. They made a move for Stafford before the Rams blew their offer out of the water. They enquired about Wilson before he chose to return to Seattle. They were the front runner on a Watson deal before sexual assault allegations took him off the market. Not to be deterred, Carolina dealt for Sam Darnold. Oops. That was a bust. Now, they’re back on the merry-go-round, ready and willing to spend whatever draft capital it takes to land a high-level starter. Rodgers and Wilson will be at the top of the list. Beyond those two, Cousins seems like the top choice. Cousins playing on a one-year deal to prove if he can be anything more than Kirk Cousins would make sense for all parties. Teddy Bridgewater to the Pittsburgh Steelers It has been a vintage Bridgewater year. Little to get excited about; little to panic about. His lack of playmaking chops means that he can never be the kind of quarterback that elevates a good roster into a great one. Still: teams will be queuing up for Bridgewater’s brand of don’t-get-me-fired ball, most likely one that will also be dipping into the draft for a young quarterback prospect. The Steelers fit the bill. Pittsburgh will be looking for a long-term replacement for Ben Roethlisberger in the draft. But they also have the defense to win now, provided they can find a quarterback who can squeeze something out of the team’s ho-hum offense. The Steelers will aim big. It’s possible that the allure of Mike Tomlin, a settled infrastructure, and a top-tier defense could be enough for Rodgers or Wilson to try to force their way to Pittsburgh. But the AFC North is a blood bath, and the Steelers’ offensive pieces — as presently constructed, pre-free agency and the draft — don’t exactly inspire a burning in the football loins.
