2/23/2022,"Wales have been warned to expect a fast and furious welcome from England at Twickenham on Saturday in a game the home team are billing as a knockout eliminator. With Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes back, Eddie Jones’s side are determined to up the tempo and improve their chances of claiming this year’s Six Nations title. According to Jones’s assistant Martin Gleeson, the former Great Britain rugby league international who is now England’s attack coach, there is a realisation among the players that, as at a World Cup, they must now win their final three games to hoist the trophy.  “It’s a massive game for us,” Gleeson said. “It’s the first time crowds have been back for a Six Nations game for a couple of years and we’re treating it like a quarter-final. If we don’t get the result on Saturday, we’re out.” Gleeson will be urging his side to take the game to Wales from the outset, having rated their training session on Tuesday as the best he has seen since he took the job last August. “We want to take it to them as quickly and early in the game as possible,” he said. “We don’t want to be playing in our shell. We want to play the brand of rugby we want straight from the kick-off. We need to have some line speed in defence and hit hard. When we’ve got the ball there’s a few opportunities we can see. We want to play with intent and go after teams.” This go-faster mission statement would appear perfectly suited to a player like Tuilagi, set to feature for the first time since damaging a hamstring against South Africa in the autumn. The statistician Russ Petty has even dug into the archives and found that England have not lost at Twickenham with Tuilagi in their matchday squad since November 2012. “Manu can just take the ball, make metres and get us quick ruck ball by himself. Not everyone can do that,” Gleeson said. “That’s why Manu is the player he is. He’s a guy who can add another dimension to your attack. You don’t always have to create overlaps or gaps in defences; he can punch holes on his own. His acceleration and the power with that is phenomenal. He’ll be good to have in the mix.” The winds of change, though, continue to blow, with two experienced Joes – Marchant and Launchbury – released from the squad last night. In recent days, too, two members of England’s matchday squad from their 2019 Rugby World Cup semi-final win over New Zealand have signalled their retirements, with George Kruis set to join Mark Wilson in stepping away from the game at the age of 32. Both Kruis and Wilson were popular squad men and highly valuable players, with 68 caps for England between them. The former is quitting to devote more time to his burgeoning business career while injury has finally caught up with the latter but, in their different ways, both underline the fierce dedication and sacrifice required to stay at the top of the professional game. It also shows just how swiftly the picture can change from a team-building perspective. There had been talk of Kruis returning to the Premiership with a view to chasing a place in next year’s World Cup in France. Instead Jones and his assistants will have to hope their forward options remain deep enough for it not to matter unduly if they lose any more big men between now and the autumn of 2023. Equally important, though, is to bed in some lasting combinations in key areas rather than simply adding random individuals to the mix here and there. Ben Youngs is set to become England’s most capped player in history this weekend but will be 34 by the time next year’s World Cup kicks off. England’s other two scrum-halves, Harry Randall and Raffi Quirke, have barely started their Test careers and no team in history has won the Webb Ellis Cup with a relative rookie in the No 9 jersey. Tuilagi and Henry Slade, however, are already a proven midfield double act and, with Owen Farrell still sidelined by injury, the big centre has been seeking to establish a good understanding with Marcus Smith. The pair roomed together during England’s training camp in Jersey and Tuilagi has been trying to put the squad’s younger players at ease. “You don’t want them to feel pressure,” the 30-year-old said. “We were just relaxing with nice tea and a couple of biscuits, nice shortbread. That’s the important thing … to connect and get to know each other.”",Sport/Sport,England warn Wales to expect furious welcome with Tuilagi and Lawes back,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/22/england-warn-wales-to-expect-furious-welcome-with-tuilagi-and-lawes-back
2/23/2022,"The footballer Troy Deeney is launching an impassioned plea for more widespread teaching of black, Asian and minority ethnic experiences by schools in England, to help combat racism and give children “a balanced and inclusive understanding” of Britain. In an open letter to the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, Deeney said he had been frustrated by the lack of progress on tackling racism in the two years since the killing of George Floyd in the US, saying that “an eerie quiet” had ended public debate.  The Birmingham City striker said he was still receiving “vile racist abuse on social media and, at times, in public,” and with three children in the education system he felt an urgent need for schools to include black, Asian and minority ethnic experiences in their curriculum. “I have seen more and more how important it is for my children to be able to see themselves represented in what they are being taught, and learn about the contribution and background of people who look like them,” Deeney said. “The importance of education at an early age to inform identity and combat racist beliefs and stereotypes cannot be understated.” Deeney’s letter follows the success of Marcus Rashford, the England and Manchester United forward, in changing government policy. In 2020 and 2021, Rashford’s public interventions and a groundswell of support led to the government reversing its decision not to provide food for children eligible for free school meals during the school holidays in the midst of the Covid pandemic. Deeney, who signed for Birmingham City this season after playing almost 400 games for Watford, is launching an online petition. He has commissioned research by the polling company YouGov into teachers’ attitudes to rebut claims that the national curriculum in England already contains ample black and minority ethnic representation. The survey of 1,000 secondary and primary school teachers, carried out this month, found that only 12% felt empowered to teach “optional” black-related topics such as colonialism, migration and identity ahead of competing optional topics, while 75% said they were not aware that resources to teach cultural diversity across the curriculum were available. It found that 54% of teachers believed the school system or national curriculum has a racial bias, rising to 93% among minority ethnic teachers. “My only experience of black history or black culture was through the food or music I experienced at home, whilst at school I felt detached. Not only was I not taught about positive role models who looked like me, I was even told by one teacher that I’d be dead by the time I was 25,” Deeney said. He was excluded from school at the age of 15 and left without any qualifications. Later, as a professional footballer, he studied and passed GCSEs in English, maths and science. “As my mum always says to me, you can’t understand where you’re going if you don’t understand where you’ve come from. Whether it’s too late for my generation, we need to lay a pathway for longer-lasting change for our kids as I believe the current system is failing children from ethnic minorities,” Deeney said. In response, a Department for Education spokesperson said the current curriculum offers pupils the opportunity to study significant figures from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and the contributions they have made to the nation. “Schools play a crucial role in helping young people understand the world around them and their place within it. We continue to be informed by the work of committed individuals and groups when it comes to supporting the teaching of black and minority ethnic history,” the spokesperson said.",News/Education,Troy Deeney calls for more diversity in English schools’ curriculum,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/22/troy-deeney-calls-for-more-diversity-in-english-schools-curriculum
2/23/2022,"For Thomas Tuchel, the hope will be that Romelu Lukaku has a better understanding of how Chelsea aspire to play after the striker spent 90 minutes watching from the bench. This was a flexible and smart performance from the European champions, who functioned perfectly well without their £97.5m signing, and on this evidence Lukaku could be forgiven for wondering if his new diminished role is here to stay. After all there is little reason for Tuchel to bring the Belgian back when Chelsea meet Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday. There could well be another humiliation on the way after this comfortable win over Lille. Chelsea were far more effective with the excellent Kai Havertz up front and they have a firm grip on this last-16 tie after Christian Pulisic gave them a 2-0 lead to take to Lille next month.  After making great play of wanting to protect Lukaku, it was telling that Tuchel decided that the best way to do so was by keeping him out of the limelight altogether. “A look of tiredness” was how the coach explained his decision to bench Chelsea’s record signing, but nobody was buying that. As ever, the evidence was on the pitch. After all Lukaku had mustered a grand total of seven touches against Crystal Palace, the fewest registered by any Premier League player over 90 minutes since Opta began keeping track in 2003. Numbers of such anonymity made it simple for Tuchel, who seemed to be on to something by picking a front three that looked pacy and tricky on paper. It was a controversial call, though, and one that Tuchel needed to come off. Chelsea have stumbled of late; their title challenge unravelling, injuries to key players taking their toll. It feels as if the next drama is always waiting to erupt and although there was a nice moment before kick-off, the injured trio of Ben Chilwell, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Reece James parading the club’s latest trophy around the pitch, the applause was accompanied by an awareness that this season is not going to be defined by Club World Cup glory. Ultimately this was more important and it looked like Chelsea knew it during the early stages. Pulisic took the game to Lille with some driving runs and the opening goal should have arrived inside four minutes, Havertz somehow turning César Azpilicueta’s cross over from close range. Would Lukaku have put it away? Probably. The point, though, is that Chelsea are far more mobile with Havertz leading the line. The Germany forward’s graceful movement was causing problems for Sven Botman and Jose Fonte, Lille’s centre-backs, and he quickly put his early miss behind him, shifting inside from the right before drawing a wonderful sprawling save from Léo Jardim after seven minutes. Eleventh in Ligue 1, Lille soon cracked. Hakim Ziyech lifted in a corner from the left and Havertz made it look easy in the middle, rising unmarked to send a bouncing header beyond Jardim. Tuchel had his vindication. For a while, with N’Golo Kanté and Mateo Kovacic controlling midfield, it was one-way traffic. Marcos Alonso went close with a volley. Pulisic kept running. Havertz was gliding around. Slowly, though, Lille came into the contest. Tuchel soon grew irritable on the touchline, roaring when Ziyech wasted a chance to shoot. The manager was seeing too many mistakes from Chelsea and Lille were growing in confidence. Jonathan Bamba and Jonathan David were looking dangerous and Chelsea, who survived a few skirmishes in their area, were relieved to escape when Antonio Rüdiger almost sliced Renato Sanches’s cross past Édouard Mendy. There was more hope for Lille after the break. Azpilicueta was working hard to contain Bamba and Chelsea were starting to retreat. Too many counterattacks were fizzling out and the worries for Tuchel increased when Kovacic made way for Ruben Loftus-Cheek before hobbling down the tunnel with an injury that could keep him out against Liverpool at Wembley. Chelsea’s early zest had all but disappeared by that stage. Alonso had a volley blocked by Zeki Celik and Havertz fired over, but the game had become increasingly bitty and Tuchel was forced into another adjustment when Ziyech went down with an ankle problem just before the hour. That, though, allowed Tuchel to regain control. He chose to bring on Saúl Ñíguez instead of another attacker and more bodies in the middle meant that there was a chance to release Kanté, who accepted his new role with relish, dousing Lille’s fight with the run that led to Chelsea’s second goal. The surge came out of nowhere. Suddenly, after an aimless Lille attack broke down, Kanté was tearing through the middle and carrying Chelsea up the pitch. Nobody could keep up with him and there was quality to go with the athleticism, the midfielder’s weighted pass sending Pulisic through to score with a lovely dink. It was a deserved goal for Pulisic. Chelsea were able to relax. The introduction of Hatem Ben Arfa was not enough for Lille, although at least he got on the pitch. With Timo Werner sent on before him, the same could not be said of Lukaku.",Sport/Football,Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic give Chelsea healthy advantage over Lille,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/chelsea-lille-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report
2/23/2022,"Students from disadvantaged backgrounds in England could be blocked from going to university unless they get strong GCSE or A-level grades, under proposals to be announced by the government this week. On Thursday the government is to publish its long-awaited response to the Augar review of higher education funding, and the Guardian has learned that a key part of the response will be the launch of a consultation on minimum entry requirements for students to be eligible for government-backed loans for tuition and maintenance.  University leaders warn that setting minimum entry requirements too high, such as requiring a grade 5 in GCSE maths and English, would effectively end the hopes of many school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds and others who could not be able to afford the £9,250 annual undergraduate tuition fee or living expenses without student loans. A key determinant will be whether a GCSE grade 4 or 5 is determined to be the minimum entry standard. About 71% of pupils in England achieve a grade 4 in GCSE English and maths, falling to 52% amoung disadvantaged households. Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “After nearly three years of inaction, this meagre response shows the government does not share the ambitions of young people and their families for their futures and the future of our country. “Instead of looking to widen access to university education, or supporting the success of our universities, the government is slamming the door on opportunity.” The announcement comes as record numbers of school leavers apply for undergraduate places. The Department for Education has been battling with the Treasury over the cost of financing for nearly three years since the Augar review was published under the then prime minister Theresa May. A further consultation will be announced on the future of foundation year courses taught at universities. Those are offered to students who don’t meet an institution’s academic requirements and remain a key point of access for many, especially mature students. However, the Augar review recommended that foundation years be restricted to further education colleges. Other headline measures to be announced include the freezing of the tuition fee at £9,250 for another two years, until the end of the current parliament. That will result in an effective cut in university incomes from teaching undergraduates, with the value of the tuition fee already considerably eroded by inflation. In real terms its value by 2024 is likely to be much less than £7,000, depending on the rate of inflation. The government will also announce a similar freeze on the threshold earnings for student loan repayments, hitting recent graduates who will find themselves having to make higher repayments as their wages rise more quickly above the threshold. Earlier this year the DfE announced that the repayment threshold – the amount at which graduates in England pay off their student loans – would be frozen at £27,295, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates would cost graduates earning £30,000 an extra £113 a year each. The IFS also calculated that the move would save the Treasury around £600m a year in higher repayments than it would have received if the threshold had been indexed to inflation as originally intended. However, the proposals to be unveiled on Thursday are expected to include some good news on capping the interest charged on student loans, although that will have no immediate effect on the level of repayments. The consultation is the government’s long delayed response to the Augar review of post-18 education and funding in England, which was announced by former prime minister Teresa May in February 2018 after Labour’s buoyant performance in the 2017 general election, thanks in part to its pledge to scrap student tuition fees. The review was launched at a time of mounting concern about the cost – and value – of higher education, after annual tuition fees rose to £9,250 and maintenance grants were scrapped, sending individual student debt spiralling to almost £50,000. When it finally reported on 30 May 2019, it included 53 recommendations on the future for the sector, including a reduction of tuition fees to £7,500, an extension of student loan repayments from 30 to 40 years and the reintroduction of maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged students. However, as time has gone on and the political climate has changed, many of Augar’s recommendations have looked increasingly unlikely. With outstanding student loans reaching £140bn last year the Treasury’s priority has been to reduce the cost of student loans to itself rather than ease the burden on students. Higher education staff and management are currently locked in a bitter industrial dispute over pensions, pay and working conditions. On Tuesday evening a key negotiating committee of the University Superannuation Scheme, which administers the pension fund for many university staff, rejected funding proposals by the University and College Union in favour of those put forward by the employers. Jo Grady, the UCU chair, warned that the decision would lead to further industrial action. “University vice-chancellors have today chosen to steal tens of thousands from the retirement income of staff. This is a deplorable attack which our members won’t take lying down,” Grady said.",News/Education,Fears that minimum grades for student loans in England could narrow access ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/22/fears-that-minimum-grades-for-student-loans-in-england-could-narrow-access
