2/11/2022,"At one of Italy’s darkest moments in the pandemic, the government introduced a list of draconian rules to halt the outbreak of Covid, including which sports Italians would be allowed to practise. Among the activities the authorities considered safe were a few Italians barely knew. One was padel, a fast-paced racket sport popular in Spain, similar to tennis but with a dash of squash thrown in.  For Italians, it was love at first smash. According to data from the Padel National Observatory, since early 2020, the number of padel courts in Italy has increased fivefold, up to almost 5,000. Padel schools and clubs have tripled, with the game likely to become the most practised sport after football in Italy. “No sport in Italy has ever had such success in such a short time,” says Salvatore Palumbo, 35, the Sicilian under-18 former tennis champion and soon to become a padel instructor. “Italians had to deal with one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. Playing sports was the only relief and a reason to leave the house.” Sports such as football and basketball were effectively banned for months because they were considered contact sports and therefore risky, while gyms and swimming pools were shut down. “At this point, there were few options left, such as tennis and padel,” said Palumbo. “But if the former requires lengthy technical preparation, the latter is much easier to learn and lots of fun. Success was immediate.” Padel was invented in 1969 by a Mexican businessman, Enrique Corcuera, who wanted to build a tennis court at his holiday home in Acapulco. Not having enough space on his property, he decided to make a smaller court and to use the walls that delimited the area as an integral part of the game. Padel is almost always played in doubles. The courts, about 25% smaller than tennis courts, are surrounded almost entirely by walls, part glass and part metal mesh. Unlike tennis, the ball remains playable if, after being hit on the ground, it then hits the walls. By the time Italy began to ease Covid restrictions, padel had taken hold. But, faced with hundreds of thousands of people eager to play, the few hundred courts around Italy were overwhelmed. “At one point, demand far exceeded supply,” says Edoardo Scarlata, 38, a lawyer from Palermo. “In Sicily, there were already dozens of padel players, but [later in] the pandemic, they became thousands. So last year, with a group of friends, we decided we had to seize this opportunity and invest in this sport.” Scarlata is now one of the owners of Padel City, a club with more than seven padel courts in a residential neighbourhood near the centre of Palermo. Today, Palermo has about 100 padel courts – there are only 90 in the United Kingdom. Many of these have supplanted five-a-side football pitches. Padel in Italy is officially recognised as a discipline of tennis and is governed by the Italian Tennis Federation (FIT) which, given the incredible growth of this sport, broadcasts padel matches every day of the year on its TV channel, Super Tennis. “The growth of padel in Italy follows in some way the growth of tennis in the country,” says FIT’s president, Angelo Binaghi. “And it is a blessing the tennis federation is its governing body, otherwise the risk was that padel courts would replace tennis ones, and one sport risking damaging the other.” Matteo De Simone, 44, a padel player and the club manager of Padel City, says the secret of the sport’s strength is that “it is a suitable sport for everyone, of all ages, and this has contributed to making padel not only a sport but a real movement in Italy. Among the players who attend our courts, there are children aged six up to men aged 80. And above all, there are many women.” At the professional level, Italian women outcompete men, said Carlo Ferrara, 50, the founder of the Mr Padel Paddle website and owner of the My Padel F84 club in Rome. “There are no Italians in the top 100 rankings of men in the world, while there are seven Italian women in the female rankings.” Chiara Pappacena, 27, who is 61st in the World Padel Tour ranking, said Italian women have long faced discrimination in the sport. “This is finally changing. I am very proud to see very young girls and women over 60 on the padel courts today.” Padel continues to grow in other European countries, such as Sweden, where its popularity has not gone unnoticed by the online dating site Tinder, which created its very first padel court as a meet-up location on a rooftop in Stockholm. The sport is most popular, however, in Spain, where padel courts have long been a common sight. Nacho Perulero, a spokesperson for the Spanish Pádel Federation, estimates the sport is now played by about 5 million people in Spain. Here, too, the pandemic has served only to fuel an “exponential growth” in padel playing, said Perulero. “It is practically impossible to reserve a court in any big Spanish city these days.” Thick, smooth and perforated paddles that resemble beach tennis rackets are used for padel, which is overwhelmingly played in doubles. The courts are surrounded almost entirely by walls, part glass and part metal mesh. The scoring is the same as in tennis, butthe ball can be played off the walls. When serving, the ball must bounce once on the floor and hit at waist level. Players can reach over the net with an arm or racket when hitting a ball but if the ball hits the net – or the wall or fencing before it hits the floor – it is a foul. After the ball hits the floor, it may hit the wall or fencing once or more before it is played back. Out-of-court plays are authorised, leading to some dramatic flourishes.",News/World news,‘No sport has had such success in so short a time’: padel takes off in Italy ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/padel-italy-takes-off-no-sport-such-success-so-short-time

2/11/2022,"Icried the night Michael K Williams joined the over 100,000 Americans who died of an overdose in 2021. When I heard that Williams, the actor best known for his role as Omar, the queer, gun-toting rogue in The Wire, had suffered an accidental overdose in his apartment, I felt a deep sense of dread. The knowledge that another Black man not too dissimilar from myself had passed before his time mingled in my mind with my bitter memory of the moment when I learned that my best friend, Joseph Rodriguez, had overdosed at the age of 19. I am grateful, I suppose, that by the time Joe had died, in 2009, the public narrative around drug users had begun to evolve. Young suburban white kids had started dying, and the country quickly shifted to protect its most prized possessions. Teens were sent to rehab, and drug dealers, like those who allegedly sold Williams his final dose, were rounded up and blamed for what is clearly a broader societal issue.  Last week four men in Brooklyn were charged with having sold fentanyl-laced heroin to Williams and others. This hollow act is part of the problem. The US has long chosen mass incarceration as the solution to substance abuse. Arresting people didn’t prevent Williams’ overdose, and arresting more now won’t prevent future ones. And given Williams’ stance on the war on drugs, it is doubtful he would have endorsed this action.There are many solutions that could have helped keep Williams alive. While it is unlikely that the US will rid itself of many of the underlying drivers of drug addiction – such as violence, systemic racism and the inequalities of capitalism – anytime soon, the country, and the federal government in particular, has long ignored policy reforms that could help address the worst of our current addiction epidemic. The most important reform, decriminalization, has gained steam in some places, like Oregon, but remains far away as a federal reform. Williams was a one-of-a-kind man and artist, but not unique in his struggles with drugs: according to the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 14.5% of Americans – roughly 40.3 million people – had a substance use disorder in 2020. A couple hundred of those people die of an overdose every day. This is a long-term trend that continues to explode over time; while over 100,000 Americans died of an overdose last year, the number was roughly 17,000 in 2000. As someone who has been involved with drug policy reform since 2010, roughly a year after my friend died, it is difficult to maintain hope as the bodies pile up, especially as solution after solution is ignored by the federal government. There are an embarrassingly large number of policies that could be backed by the federal government and implemented nationwide to save lives and nudge addicted people towards healing. Rather than concentrating power in the police through criminalization, most of these policies involve treating drug users like human beings worthy of love and care. One of the simplest ways to save lives is to make drug testing kits easily available for drug users. Williams was reportedly poisoned by fentanyl, a synthetic opioid mixed into cocaine and heroin as a means for illicit manufacturers to increase profits. Drug testing kits, like fentanyl test trips, let consumers ensure that they know what they’re putting into their bodies. While these strips are available for free in some places, such as New York City, they are still illegal in many states because they’re considered drug paraphernalia. Another potentially life-saving intervention? Supervised consumption sites. These are locations where people can consume drugs safely, with the support of medical staff that can ensure the purity of what is being used while being on call to intervene in the event of accidental overdoses. These locations can also connect people with treatment services and safer alternative drugs. If this all feels unfamiliar, think of bars as a crude version of these sites: bartenders administer doses to clients and can cut them off if they are too intoxicated. If anyone drinks too much, bartenders can call an ambulance and have them hospitalized. Creating robust supervised consumption sites could save lives, and destigmatizing those sites could save even more. All of these interventions would be made more effective and possible if the federal government took the important leap to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of all drugs. Total decriminalization may seem extreme, but there is evidence that it could save lives, reduce drug use, and prevent more unnecessary incarceration and harassment of those who use drugs, particularly Black Americans. Living in New York City, Williams did have access to some harm reduction resources but, like many drug users, may have felt too much stigma to seek help.Portugal decriminalized all drugs, in small amounts, in 2001. The country has also radically expanded its capacity to treat substance use disorders. According to the US-based Drug Policy Alliance, overdose deaths in Portugal decreased by more than 80% after decriminalization. By contrast, in 2017, “there were more than 72,000 overdose deaths in the US. If the US overdose death rate were on par with Portugal’s, there would have been fewer than 800 overdose deaths that year.” By 2008, three-quarters of those suffering from substance use disorder in Portugal were in treatment. The deaths of Michael K Williams and Joseph Rodriguez were perfectly preventable if we’d wanted them to live. Addiction is inevitable in our present society. Capitalism is a system that necessarily involves the commodification of human beings and the reduction of the individual into a tiny cog that exists to work and create profit. This dehumanization, exacerbated by racism, is probably why there are strong relationships between poverty and addiction, and why Black men are now the people most likely to overdose and die.The reality is that there will be many more deaths like Williams’. I expect to lose more friends; it would be naive to think that I won’t. In recent years both Democrats and Republicans have slowly shifted closer to the kind of drug reforms that could save lives. But for some of the people I love it is too little, too late and, without a comprehensive federal plan that includes decriminalization, we may as well brace ourselves for more tearful phone calls and funerals.

2/11/2022,"The fact that Love Is Blind was Netflix’s breakout dating show took me by surprise. I thought the real hit would be the trashier Too Hot To Handle, which forbade its contestants from having sex then did everything it could to encourage them to do just that. Instead, it was the series that attempted to prove a seemingly heartwarming theory. It argued that if the digital age of dating apps is superficial and looks-based, perhaps we should allowe two people to fall in love with one another, without either seeing what the other looked like. Now it is back for a second season, returning in exactly the same clothes it was wearing last night. The focus is soft and the music is soaring. Every time something emotional happens, the background music swoops in at top volume, and sings the couples’ feelings, like a toddler trying to articulate itself. “I’m afraid!” goes the music, as someone reveals their vulnerabilities. “I feel it all!” it pounds, as someone tries to work out who it is they prefer, while glugging from a golden goblet. This is a series that is very pleased with its own work, its theory apparently “proven” by the first season, which provided two couples (Lauren and Cameron and Amber and Matthew) with what appear to be genuine happily-ever-after marriages. It is, insists host Nick Lachey, “a proven approach for finding love.”  Well, it is, and also, it isn’t. It is a proved approach to making undeniably gripping television, but it is as cooked-up and massaged as any other reality show. We meet 14 men and women, all claiming to be exasperated by the superficiality of modern dating, all ready to propose to someone they have never laid eyes upon. But first, the “pod” stage, which is speed dating behind frosted glass, with the couples taking more notes than Gogglebox’s Jenny watching an episode of Line of Duty. We don’t see these annotations, which is a shame. One contestant proudly writes the name of another at the very front of his book, which suggests his understanding of true love peaked at primary school. The topics go deep, quickly. The couples talk about tough childhoods, relationship histories, racial stereotypes and assumptions based on class. The men talk about being macho, or not being macho enough; the women have a thinly veiled loathing of their own bodies, and worry that they are too old. It is depressing. But it does seem more brutally frank than most dating shows, if not in what they are actually saying to each other, then in how they are talking about themselves. It soon becomes apparent who the “stars” of this series will be, and what their “storylines” are. Many of the contestants fail to meet their match, and simply fade into the background, and the ones who last tend to be the biggest, loudest, most complex characters. If you ever wondered whether your partner believing in evolution (or not) would be a romantic dealbreaker, then allow this show to put that to the test. Insecurities run rife, as people attempt to put their preconceived notions about what constitutes physical attractiveness to one side. For all of its crowing about finding proof that physical attractiveness is irrelevant, though, it often proves the opposite. It shows that all people are judgmental, to some degree, and it naughtily nudges viewers to feel the same. The most enlightening moments in these early episodes are when the couples finally come face-to-face, running towards each other, or not, from behind Blind Date-style screens. (“I think you’re a beautiful person, inside and out,” says one contestant to another, just before the reveal, which is, surely, jumping the gun.) I strongly believe that you can tell in an instant whether they fancy each other or not, no matter how much they claim to be attracted to “energy”. A holiday in Cancún, Mexico, follows the pods and marriage proposals, so that the new couples can get to know each other better before walking down the aisle. See if you can spot the fearful looks off into the distance the participants have when they think nobody is looking at them. It is all so excruciatingly, unbearably intimate. You see arguments, rows, deeply personal discussions, betrayals, regrets. Entire relationships form and collapse at a staggering rate. The programme-makers throw spanner after spanner into the works. The spectacle is undeniable. It is hard to look away. Netflix is staggering the release of this into a semi-binge, dropping the first five episodes in one instalment, followed by the next four a week later, and the finale a week after that. I will be there until the bitter end. But am I proud of myself for it? I’m not so sure.",Arts/Television & radio,Love Is Blind review – the return of the dating show you can’t take your eyes off,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/11/love-is-blind-review-netflix-the-return-of-the-dating-show-you-cant-take-your-eyes-off
2/11/2022,"In January 1788, a fleet of British ships under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip anchored in a bay known as Warrane to the people living there. What happened next is the familiar story of Australia’s founding. Less widely known is that 11 blood-sucking vampires were also brought ashore by the “First Fleet” that day. Once loose, they became addicted to the blood of Indigenous Australians and set about massacring the population, thereby weakening their resistance to the British invaders. Or at least, that’s according to Shanika and Tyson, the vampire-killing “bloodhunters” at the centre of a new eight-part Australian series, Firebite. And who are we to argue?  Nothing less than history, and who gets to decide it, is at stake in the new wave of colonial-confronting horror being made by First Nations film-makers from all over the world. Firebite originated in the brain of Warwick Thornton, a Kaytetye man from Australia’s Northern Territory and an internationally feted film-maker since 2009, when his debut feature, Samson and Delilah, won the Caméra d’Or (best first feature prize) at Cannes. “Y’know, we’ve made a lot of really worthy films,” says Thornton wryly, referring to himself and his Firebite co-creator, Brendan Fletcher. Fletcher is a white Australian film-maker who has long worked with Indigenous communities in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, including on his 2011 Sundance hit, Mad Bastards. “But with this, we just wanted to kick in the doors and turn the amps up for our mob, so that our kids can see us killing vampires.” Firebite absolutely lives up to that description, thanks to a raucous punk soundtrack and the rebellious energy of its two leads. Rob Collins, a well-established heart-throb with roots in the Tiwi Islands, plays Tyson, and relative newcomer Shantae Barnes-Cowan (an Adnyamathanha woman from South Australia) plays his adoptive daughter, Shanika. One of the white supporting characters is played by Australian actor Yael Stone, best known as Morello from Orange Is the New Black, who says she’s glad to be involved in a show that is correcting the “fantastical, polite version” of history she was taught at school. “Even if someone says: ‘That’s all bullshit,’ maybe they’ll then do some of their own research and find out: ‘Oh, actually, turns out there’s all these local massacre sites here, where I live,’” Stone says. “Because it really doesn’t take much to scratch the surface in Australia.” Like Stone and many other Australians, Thornton was well into adulthood before he learned details about the brutality of the British colonists. One lodged firmly in his imagination: the existence of 11 vials of smallpox on the First Fleet, which many historians now believe amounts to an act of biological warfare against the original inhabitants. “A lot of the history books don’t write anything about vials of smallpox, or Indigenous people,” says Thornton. “They called the place terra nullius, which is a land of no people – but we were here. So every time we make a film, even if we’re just trying to have some rock’n’roll fun, it’s always going to be a bit deeper, darker and slightly shocking.” The vampires-as-smallpox metaphor might be an elaboration on the historical record, but it would allow Thornton and Fletcher to get at the true horror of the past: “If you really wanted to talk about the Gadigal [the Indigenous population the colonisers first encountered] being wiped out by smallpox, it would be almost unwatchable,” he says. “So a vampire story is just a great device that allows us to, ironically, tell the truth, in terms of its essence.” Firebite is one of several films and TV series in recent years to use popular genres to add clarity, unheard perspectives and, not least, lots of gore to the official, sanitised version of colonial history. Reservation Dogs, an Oklahoma-set, Indigenous show on Disney+, has won a slew of awards for its Seminole creator Sterlin Harjo, by melding native spiritual traditions – such as “Deer Lady” or a bad-omen owl – with irreverent comedy. That show’s star, Devery Jacobs, also appears in Blood Quantum (2019), an Indigenous – and ingenious – Canadian zombie movie from Mi’kmaq writer-director Jeff Barnaby, in which the Red Crow reservation becomes a sanctuary from the infected hordes of white-people zombies. Back in Australia, Bjorn Stewart, a Kuku-Yalanji/Wemba Wemba man, is developing his short Killer Native into another zombie feature, about a modern-day British couple terrorised by the reanimated corpses of the smallpox-ravaged dead. While all these examples are recent, the Barbican in London is screening Tracey Moffatt’s 1993 film Bedevil, as part of their season Homeland: Films by Australian First Nations directors. This trio of ghost stories made Moffatt the first Australian Indigenous woman to direct a feature. Nearly 30 years later another Indigenous woman, Leah Purcell, has also chosen to make her feature debut in the genre space. The Drover’s Wife: The Legend of Molly Johnson, another film in the Homeland programme, is an outback western that reimagines Henry Lawson’s 1892 short story as a tale of resistance and resilience. Purcell herself stars as the eponymous, rifle-toting drover’s wife, alongside Firebite’s Rob Collins as a fugitive Indigenous man, loosely based on Purcell’s own great-grandfather. “If you pick a popular genre, then you know you’re going to get an audience,” says Purcell of her decision to tell her story as a western. This sounds like a bait-and-switch move, but all genre thrills will be delivered as advertised: “First and foremost, I want to go out there and entertain people. Secondly, I will always, as an Indigenous woman, put [across] my family’s plight through those stories.” For Indigenous film-makers, horror can be a means to reclaim stolen creative territory and otherwise get your own back. “In every Indigenous community, so much of our traditional storytelling is based in this sort of world,” says Thornton. “Not vampires, but in monsters and demons and morals.” Vampires, specifically, have no Australian roots and are best thought of as “just another kind of nasty animal that was sent here”, as much an invasive species as the European rabbit. Perhaps that’s why the traditional vampire-killing kit of holy water and a crucifix is useless here. Firebite’s fanged undead can only be slain by exposure to the scorching desert sun or a boomerang to the heart. Vampire stories are endlessly adaptable and enduringly popular, but maybe, says Collins, it’s the changing perspectives that really matter. “I think Australia’s been swept up in what feels like a global urge to see diversity on screen. And there’s this feeling – I don’t know how accurate this is – that Indigenous stories are becoming really attractive to people abroad.” Someone who agrees, and has the sales charts to prove it, is Emile Sherman, Firebite’s executive producer and the co-founder of UK-Australian production company See-Saw Films. See-Saw has never previously worked with an Indigenous director or an Indigenous-led cast, though it’s had huge successes with prestigious, socially minded dramas such as The King’s Speech (2011) and Lion (2016), both of which won numerous awards. But “now is the moment”, says Sherman, thanks to “a combination of interest in uncovering voices that haven’t been heard before, together with a genre-engine, together with the economic model of the S-Vods [streaming and video-on-demand] services”. Previously, low-budget Indigenous horror such as Blood Quantum or Rodrick Pocowatchit’s zombie comedy The Dead Can’t Dance (2010) would only have been seen by small festival audiences. Now they are available to appreciative genre fans globally on Shudder and Amazon Prime Video, respectively. Meanwhile, deals such as the one See-Saw did with AMC+, the new streaming wing of the American network behind Breaking Bad, secured Firebite a budget that can really – as Thornton would put it – “kick in the doors and turn the amps up”. So while it’s probably still true that history is written by the victors, media technology is helping to shift the narrative power balance. In Captain Arthur Phillip’s day it would have taken at least a year for any message about successfully subdued “natives” to get back to Britain. Now, thanks to the universal language of zombie gore, Indigenous people can get their side across at the speed of superfast broadband. Firebite is coming soon to UK television. The Barbican’s Homeland: Films by Australian First Nations directors runs to 23 February.

2/11/2022,"Fifa has confirmed its ethics committee is in the early stages of an investigation into multiple allegations of sexual abuse around the world that are understood to include incidents tied to the Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team and its former coach Hubert Busby Jr. Busby was suspended from his role as head coach of the Jamaica women’s national team late last year after the Guardian reported allegations by a former player that Busby attempted to solicit sex from her while she was being recruited to join the Whitecaps in 2010. Busby has denied the allegations but the Jamaica Football Federation requested Fifa investigate his time in charge of the Whitecaps women’s program.  “We can confirm that Fifa’s independent Ethics Committee is currently gathering information from different parties concerning historic abuse allegations that have been made, which will be analyzed in accordance with the scope and competence of the Fifa Code of Ethics,” football’s governing body wrote in a statement to the Guardian. It is understood the broad nature of the statement – while also avoiding specifics – means there are multiple cases of sexual abuse under review. “The size and scale of an investigation is on a case-by-case basis and there is no set timeframe,” a Fifa spokesman said. In the United States, investigations into allegations of sexual abuse by coaches and the failure of organizations to adequately address such claims have been recently announced by US Soccer as well as the National Women’s Soccer League. Canada Soccer and Major League Soccer have also launched separate investigations into allegations of abuse within Canada’s national women’s youth teams and the Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team. Abuse of players and the failure of organizations to substantially address allegations is a global issue. Allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct by administrators, coaches, and even teammates, have been recently reported in the UK, Australia, Afghanistan, Haiti, Barbados, Gabon, and Venezuela. While Fifa can issue a ban from football related activity for 10 years if an individual is found guilty of sexual abuse by its ethics committee, it is simultaneously restricted by its own guidelines that state cases cannot be prosecuted more than 10 years after they occurred. According to American attorney John Manly, who won a $500m settlement case as lead counsel for victims of infamous US Olympic women’s gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, Fifa’s rules demonstrate that sports organizations cannot investigate allegations within their own sport, especially regarding time limits on sexual abuse cases. “If you talk to any knowledgeable law enforcement officer they will tell you the late reporting of sexual abuse cases is common and usual,” said Manly, who now represents several former Vancouver Whitecaps women’s team players. “What you have is a by-law that is designed to fail. Everybody knows that if you report during your playing years, your career is over. “USA Gymnastics not only had Larry Nassar but tremendous problems with abusive coaches and a statute of limitations that was a year. They only had to investigate if the victim or the victim’s parents signed a statement under oath in writing. Nobody does that. It’s not how it works. This is not a matter of ignorance. If this was 1965 we could say ‘OK, maybe you are ignorant’. It’s 2022. They know damn well how this works and it is a system designed to give you public relations cover but a policy to fail the athlete as well.” The Vancouver Whitecaps case is a standout as Busby was the second coach who players reported for inappropriate behavior. After abuse allegations from players in 2009, coach Bob Birarda, who was simultaneously head coach of Canada’s U-20 women’s team, left his roles with the Whitecaps and national team by “mutual agreement” but returned to coaching teenage girls in the Vancouver area within months. Birada was last year arrested in Vancouver charged with six counts of sexual exploitation, two counts of sexual assault, and one count of child luring over a 20-year period between 1988 and 2008. The charges against Birarda are understood to involve at least four female players. This month he pled guilty to one count of sexual exploitation and three counts of sexual assault and is awaiting sentencing. Adding to the complexity of any Fifa investigation into Canada Soccer and the Vancouver Whitecaps is that the deputy chair of the Fifa ethics committee investigative chamber is Bruno De Vita, an attorney whose resume boasts his role defending sports and religious organizations from sexual abuse claims. De Vita is a Canadian who grew up in the strong soccer community of East Vancouver, alongside Concacaf president and Fifa vice-president Victor Montagliani, as well as Whitecaps executives (and brothers) Bob and Dan Lenarduzzi. Fifa could not confirm if De Vita would recuse himself from any investigation into events in Canada. “This underlines the complications of organizations investigating themselves,” says Kim Shore, a former board member of Gymnastics Canada currently involved in an independent taskforce into the culture of sports organization governance. “There are so many complex relationships, so many vested interests, and people invested in their own rise. “It is also not up to Fifa to say when a victim finds their voice. Many victims are just finding their voice now, especially if you are talking about someone growing from being a child into an adult. It’s not up to the sports organization to decide that someone should have come forward sooner.” Manly also questions the use of the term “independent” when referring to organizations investigating misconduct. Vancouver attorney Anne Chopra was hired in 2008 by Canada Soccer and the Vancouver Whitecaps to investigate the allegations against Birarda and his subsequent hire and exit. However, Chopra signed a non-disclosure agreement, and the report disappeared. No copy of Chopra’s investigation exists today. Montagliani, a Canada Soccer board member at the time, has said he and his fellow board members “followed the appropriate steps… with this very serious matter.” After recent media interest in how Canada Soccer handled the 2008 allegations against Birarda, the organization commissioned a new investigation into the events by McLaren Global Sports Solutions, a Canadian firm that has also investigated doping, bribes, and corruption in a variety of sports. One report from MGSS is due to be completed in April, focussing on the events of 2008 and the subsequent investigation undertaken by Chopra. A second report from MGSS, due in July will review Canada Soccer’s current policies and programs. “Attorneys that investigate their clients rarely find them guilty,” Manly said of the multiple investigations into sexual abuse in soccer now underway. “These investigations are always designed to protect the institution and designed to give them public relations cover to get the media and the public to believe they are actually doing something.” MLS, which is investigating the Vancouver Whitecaps allegations, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. A spokesperson for Canada Soccer said in an email that MGSS “has complete independence of Canada Soccer and has a demonstrated history of independence. Canada Soccer is paying for the transparent third-party independent review but this does not constitute an attorney-client relationship. MGSS is not our attorney or legal counsel but an independent group that Canada Soccer has engaged to conduct this review with the autonomy to proceed with the investigation as they deem necessary.” Canada Soccer officials who were aware of the 2008 allegations against Birarda have subsequently risen to powerful global positions within soccer. Montagliani is now president of Concacaf and a Fifa vice-president. A Concacaf spokesperson has said Montagliani’s 2008 role as director of national teams was fiduciary oversight. Peter Montopoli, Canada Soccer general-secretary at the time of the allegations against Birarda and the Chopra report, was responsible for the day-to-day running of the organization. Last year Montopoli was appointed chief operating officer of the Fifa World Cup 2026 for Canada. Manly maintains that national sports organizations and clubs hold all the power when it comes to athletes reporting abuse and that the experience of female athletes under multiple coaches at Vancouver Whitecaps is a perfect example of how difficult it is for allegations to be treated appropriately. “The situation [for the Whitecaps players] is common,” Manly said. “No matter what country you are in there is only one way [to the Olympics or the World Cup] and that is through the federation. There is also only one professional soccer league for women. If you make a claim while you are playing then how is that going to affect your career? Not great. There needs to be a methodology for women to be confident that when they report it is not going to be used against them. “No woman – or man – should have to subject herself to sexual favors to play. They should be able to play and participate in a sport whether as an amateur or professional based on their ability. We believe this is a much larger problem not only in soccer but in other sports. And it has been going on for a long time. I believe these women [who have come forward] have opened the Pandora’s Box.” ",Sport/Sport,Lawyer in Nassar case questions validity of investigations into sexual abuse in soccer,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/11/lawyer-in-nassar-case-questions-validity-of-investigations-into-sexual-abuse-in-soccer
2/11/2022,"Cattle from a small south-east Michigan farm that sold beef to schools and at farmers’ markets in the state have been found to contain dangerous levels of PFAS, so-called “forever chemicals” that can pose a serious risk to human health. The news comes after consumer groups in 2019 warned that using PFAS-laden sewage sludge as fertilizer would contaminate dairy, beef, crops and other food products. However, at the time a Michigan agricultural regulator publicly assured the state’s dairy farmers her agency wouldn’t test milk for the toxic chemicals as they didn’t want to inflict economic pain on the $15bn industry, she said.  Now just over two years later, consumer groups say their fears may have come true. Michigan discovered the contamination because it tests sewage sludge for PFAS more than any other state, but officials have downplayed the incident as “isolated” and for now won’t conduct further testing on livestock, dairy or crops. “It’s not enough – we need a lot more monitoring of our agriculture to make sure we’re keeping toxic chemicals out of our food supply,” said Christy McGillivray, executive director of Sierra Club of Michigan. Sludge isn’t the only route PFAS takes into the nation’s food. It’s also found in pesticides, rain, packaging and water used on crops, and testing is increasingly finding the chemicals in vegetables, seafood, meat, dairy and processed foods. Consumer groups say regulators are failing to keep the dangerous compounds out of food, a problem highlighted by the Michigan contamination. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of over 9,000 compounds that are used to make products heat, water and stain resistant. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down, and they are so effective that they are used in thousands of products across dozens of industries. The chemicals are also linked to a range of serious health problems like cancer, liver disease, kidney issues, high cholesterol, birth defects and decreased immunity. Still, the US Department of Agriculture has largely been absent from the PFAS discussion while the US Food And Drug Administration hasn’t yet established health limits for food. The agency only conducts limited annual testing and recently adjusted its methodology so it will only catch what consumer groups say are extremely high contamination levels, and ignore relatively low to moderate levels that can still pose a health risk. In 2019, the FDA initially found 182 food samples to be contaminated with PFAS, but, after changing its methodology part way through the study, that figure dropped to 78, drawing accusations that it was intentionally covering up contamination. “Imagine using a radar gun to detect speeding in cars, but then manipulating the radar so that it only detects speeding in cars going over 100mph,” wrote Brian Ronholm, a former deputy under secretary of food safety at the US Department of Agriculture, in Consumer Reports after the FDA announced the change. Meanwhile, the FDA allows short-chain PFAS to be used in food packaging despite a growing body of evidence that the chemicals bioaccumulate, leach into food and are toxic at very low levels. Though health limits for PFAS in water have been dropping in recent years, the FDA seems to be allowing relatively high levels in food, and the agency “hasn’t really explained why they don’t have any concerns”, said Maricel Maffini, an independent food safety scientist who has petitioned the FDA to restrict PFAS in food packaging. “There’s a health risk in water at very, very small levels of exposure, so why would food be different?” she asked. “The FDA could be doing a lot more.” Meanwhile, sewage sludge is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which allows the substance to be spread even as it investigates potential health risks. Wastewater treatment plants clean sewer system water, and sludge is the process’s semi-solid byproduct. It’s expensive to dispose of, and about 60% of it is now lightly treated and sold or given away as “biosolid” fertilizer because it’s high in plant nutrients. Consumer groups note sludge can also contain any of 90,000 manmade chemicals discharged into sewers, and the Sierra Club has characterized it as “the most pollutant-rich manmade substance on Earth”. In a scathing 2018 report the EPA office of inspector general wrote that the EPA couldn’t properly regulate biosolids because “it lacked the data or risk assessment tools needed to make a determination on the safety of 352 pollutants” that the office found in sludge samples. PFAS is the chemical in sludge getting the most attention, and Michigan’s biosolid program, run by the department of environment, Great Lakes and energy (EGLE), requires wastewater treatment plants to monitor for one type of PFAS. The agency has also identified dozens of PFAS polluters and required them to stop discharging the chemicals, and prohibits highly contaminated sludge from being spread. But questions remain about whether that’s enough to keep PFAS out of the food supply. Instead of implementing a wide-scale program to test livestock, crops and dairy for the chemicals, state agencies identified 13 farm fields considered most at risk for high levels of PFAS contamination, then checked nearby soil, surface water and groundwater for the compounds. State officials say the beef incident is isolated because the farm received some of the state’s most contaminated sludge, and because of its allegedly unique farming practices – the cows were fed on contaminated crops grown on the farm. But consumer groups say the limited testing process leaves huge blind spots, and is guided by arbitrary health risk standards. All biosolids contain PFAS, and EGLE considers sludge with less than 150 parts per billion (ppb) of PFAS to be safe to spread on farmland. But no one knows if sludge with less than 150 ppb of PFAS is safe to use. A spokesperson said the agency is waiting on the EPA to develop health risk standards, and called EGLE’s biosolids program “a good interim step”. Moreover, state regulators only have the authority to regulate PFAS in sludge, but thousands more types of PFAS exist, evidence suggests the entire chemical class poses health risks, and PFAS levels in sludge are likely much higher when other compounds are included. The state also relies on industry to self report and must get farmers’ permission to test cows. Already some farmers with high levels of the chemical in soil and water around their fields won’t let EGLE test cows. McGillivray said Sierra Club Michigan is calling on the state to prohibit the use of biosolids as a fertilizer, establish health risk standards, compensate farmers who are impacted, and hold chemical companies and polluters accountable. Ultimately, the incident is more evidence that PFAS need to be banned, she added. “The companies that make them have not had to show that they are safe, and instead the public has to show that harm has been caused, and that leads to rolling public health crises like this one with PFAS,” McGillivray said.",News/Environment,Michigan beef found to contain dangerous levels of ‘forever chemicals’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/michigan-beef-dangerous-levels-forever-chemicals
2/11/2022,"To date, more than 48 million people in the UK (that’s 84% of over 12s) have now received their first and second Covid-19 vaccination doses, with more than 37 million receiving their “booster” or third dose too. The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency shows shortly after getting a booster, you are 85% less likely to end up in hospital than if you are unvaccinated. According to the Office for National Statistics, more than nine in 10 adults in the UK currently have coronavirus antibodies, either due to a past Covid infection or thanks to receiving the vaccine. But some still remain hesitant to receive their vaccination, citing reasons such as fear of potential side-effects and concerns over the speed of the vaccine’s creation, as well as practical barriers such as physical and mental health conditions making appointments difficult. Merchandising administrator and dancer, Camila Lopez-Pulido, 26, from London, fell into the vaccine hesitant camp, initially unsure about taking up the vaccine. “There were a number of reasons I was hesitant about getting vaccinated, but I think primarily it was the uncertainty of the whole situation,” she says. “To create a vaccine in such a short amount of time and to know so little about it – that was worrying to me. I was unsure, thinking: ‘How do I know this isn’t going to affect me in a year, or five years’ time?’ I felt we didn’t know enough about the vaccines and that worried me if I’m honest.”  Uncertainty over the right thing to do meant Lopez-Pulido held off booking her vaccination appointment. “I’d been receiving NHS text messages asking me to book my vaccine since July 2021, but I kept putting it off,” she says. The situation proved stressful, made worse by conflicting views within her friendship group, a situation many others will be familiar with. “There was definitely a split where some friends believed one thing and others believed differently. It was really difficult,” she says. “I think it’s hard to have an open conversation around vaccines without people assuming you think the virus ‘doesn’t exist’ or you’re disregarding the severity of the situation, which I’m absolutely not. I suppose I was just curious because I figured there’s no going back once you’ve had it.” It wasn’t until September [2021], ahead of a holiday to Greece, that she booked her first vaccine appointment. “I figured I’d eventually have to do it and there was no point putting it off any longer,” she says. “I also reasoned that I’m an occasional drinker and social smoker and I’ve had plenty of other vaccinations before, including when pregnant. If I’m honest, I didn’t do my research back then or really know what was being done to my body at that point, so why was I assuming the worst now, why not take the vaccine? It seemed silly,” she says. An awareness for those around her also played a part in her decision. “I’m pretty convinced that before I got vaccinated, I had already contracted Covid-19 so I’m very lucky to be healthy. My family and I weren’t affected by the pandemic health wise like many other families have been, thankfully. So while I felt relieved to be getting vaccinated, it wasn’t necessarily in terms of my own health – more in terms of people like my mother, because she’s older so could have underlying health issues.” Much to Lopez-Pulido’s relief, the vaccination itself was simple, without side-effects or complications. “The vaccine didn’t affect me in terms of my health – so far, everything has been pretty normal and I haven’t felt any different or experienced symptoms really. Even straight after the injection, I had a sore arm and that was it. I didn’t get a bad cold or a temperature at all, so I guess that was my biggest relief.” There was another major benefit too, she says. “I have two children: Kiara, aged seven, and Jacob, who is four years old, and I’d planned to take them to Disneyland Paris pretty much their entire lives. When we went as a family in November, the fact I was vaccinated made it so much easier. It was very much like ‘take out your NHS passes and your vaccination certificates’ everywhere we went. I was so incredibly relieved, thinking: ‘Gosh, imagine if I wasn’t vaccinated – we wouldn’t be able to have done this.’ I definitely felt much more at ease knowing I could live my life again, really.” My son Max was born in July 2021 and throughout my pregnancy, I was pretty anxious and uncertain over whether or not to get vaccinated. Months of deliberation meant I waited until May [2021], two months before Max was born via C-section, to have my first dose. I was able to squeeze in the second dose a few weeks before giving birth, getting my booster in December after he was born. Throughout my pregnancy, I felt conflicted about the vaccination because it felt like there was a lack of information available about the vaccine’s safety during pregnancy. I was also aware that being pregnant and having an autoimmune condition could make me more susceptible to serious illness or other complications if I were to contract Covid-19. It meant I spent a lot of time researching studies, as well as speaking to my hospital consultant, midwife and GP, asking for advice around what to do. Unfortunately, I found nobody wanted to give specific recommendations. As a first-time mum, you’re especially nervous, which meant all the uncertainty around the vaccine definitely added to the fear and paranoia. There were so many horror stories that it was difficult to know what to believe, or what to choose. My partner was supportive and said he was behind me, whatever I chose to do. I think the turning point for me came after speaking to my GP, who was seven months pregnant herself. She explained that she’d gotten the vaccine because she was seeing patients regularly and felt it was the best decision, so that really reassured me. Because Max was due to be born by C-section, I also knew that could make me more prone to infection, so that was another reason to get the vaccine. Looking back, I’m really relieved I got vaccinated when I did. I’ve since heard of friends of friends who contracted Covid-19 while having their baby in hospital and it sounds incredibly stressful being isolated at such a vulnerable time. I knew getting the virus would add another huge layer of stress, whereas I actually felt quite relaxed going into hospital to have Max, without the worry of contracting it or potentially passing it on to someone else. Even the thought of having a cold when pregnant or with a newborn was awful – the reality of catching Covid-19 would have been really hideous. I think, ultimately, the risk of catching the virus while pregnant – and being in intensive care or having a premature labour – outweighed any potential vaccine consequences that might realistically never have even come to light. I suppose it was measuring up the theoretical consequences with a genuine, real risk. Thankfully, Max was born with no complications either – and I’m pleased to say, very happy and healthy indeed. Pregnant women who get symptomatic Covid-19 infection are up to three times more likely to give birth to their baby prematurely. More than 96% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms between May and October 2021 were unvaccinated. Around one in five women who are hospitalised with the virus need to deliver preterm to help them recover. Get your booster in England now by visiting nhs.uk/covidvaccination.

2/11/2022,"That the props department had to source a giant birthday cake, a pink flamingo inflatable swimming ring and several luminous green hula hoops for this production should tell you everything you need to know about the reverence in which the source material is held. Director Anthony Lau, using a celebrated 1992 adaptation by Helen Edmundson, shows almost no respect for the milieu of Tolstoy’s epic masterpiece, and in thumbing his nose at the weighty reputation of the Russian’s magnum opus activates the story to create a production that is thrilling and utterly compelling.  It is all built around an absorbing performance from Adelle Leoncé as the eponymous heroine. She goes through the wringer over the course of the three-hour piece, leaving everything on the stage. Around her, Lau makes some seriously bold choices. The costumes and staging are Baz Luhrmann-esque; indeed one scene that descends from Russian aristocratic ball to all-out disco could slip into any of the films in the Australian director’s red curtain trilogy. Edmundson’s smartly economical storytelling has Anna and Konstantin Levin, played here by the highly watchable Dougie McMeekin, asking each other “‘where are you now?”. Standing on an empty stage Anna can tell him “I’m on a train heading for Moscow” or “I’m in an Italian town in an old, shabby palazzo” and so she is and with her we go. Lau takes Edmundson’s economy and adds buckets full of irreverence. A day at the races becomes seriously racy as Anna gives into her animal urges with lover Count Vrosnky in a highly erotic seduction scene. A visit to Princess Betsy and one of her infamous parties is a hilariously postmodern, shot-drinking, bacchanalian affair. Leoncé’s Anna is a woman apart in several ways, the acting around her all nods and winks and slightly outside the action while she is entirely immersed in it. The angels of death who occasionally stalk the stage, looking like steampunk slaughtermen, lend an air of menace to a production that sees design and direction in perfect symbiosis. This is a spectacle in every sense. The purists? Let them eat giant birthday cake.

2/11/2022,"The stability of the Indo-Pacific will also be in danger if Russia is allowed to threaten Ukraine with impunity, the US secretary of state has warned during a visit to Australia. Antony Blinken said on Friday there were “very troubling signs of Russian escalation”, adding: “We’re in a window when an invasion could begin at any time – and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics.”  He said the US would continue to draw down its embassy in Kyiv and reiterated calls for any American citizens who remain in Ukraine to leave immediately, following Joe Biden’s comment that “things could go crazy quickly”. After joining with his Australian, Indian and Japanese counterparts for a meeting of the Quad in Melbourne, Blinken made the case that allowing Russia to further invade Ukraine would have far wider consequences and could embolden other countries, such as China, to pursue military aggression. Russia, he said, was challenging the principles that “one country can’t simply change the borders of another by force” or “dictate to another its choices, its policies, with whom it will associate”. “If we allow those principles to be challenged with impunity, even if it’s half the world away in Europe, that will have an impact here as well – others are watching,” Blinken told reporters. “Others are looking to all of us to see how we respond. So that’s why it’s so important that we have this solidarity: that we do everything possible, through diplomacy, to try to avert a conflict and prevent aggression – but equally, to be resolute if Russia renews its aggression.” Russia has accused the west of ignoring its requests for security guarantees, including an assurance that Ukraine never join Nato. Blinken was in Melbourne for a meeting with foreign ministers of the Quad, an increasingly active diplomatic grouping that is viewed warily by China, which sees it as an effort to contain its influence. The meeting comes a week after China’s Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin of Russia signed a joint statement calling on the west to “abandon the ideologised approaches of the cold war”, as the two leaders showcased their warming relationship in Beijing at the start of the Winter Olympics. This so-called “no limits” agreement was one of the developments discussed at Friday’s meeting of the Quad foreign ministers. The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said Russia and China’s agreement was “concerning because it doesn’t represent a global order that squares with those ambitions for freedom and openness and sovereignty and the protection of territorial integrity”. Speaking at a joint news conference with her Quad counterparts, Payne said rules and norms were “under pressure, in particular from authoritarian regimes”. “Australia, in our actions, works to support a world order that favours freedom – where rules, not power and coercion, resolve disputes,” she said. Payne reiterated Australia’s “strong support for Ukraine sovereignty and territorial integrity” and signalled Australia was ready to join an international sanctions package targeted at Russia. Australia, she said, would “continue to support our allies and partners to deter this sort of aggression and to raise the costs of this kind of behaviour”. Japan’s foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said his country would continue to collaborate with the international community and “take appropriate responses”. Friday’s meeting was productive, said India’s minister of external affairs, Dr S. Jaishankar. He said the Quad had a positive agenda, including on vaccine distribution. He said the Quad stood “for something, not against somebody”. The joint statement issued by the Quad foreign ministers did not directly name China, but stressed “the importance of adherence to international law” to meet “challenges to the maritime rules-based order, including in the South and East China Seas” – where China is engaged in territorial disputes. Clearly alluding to China, the statement also said the Quad countries “oppose coercive economic policies and practices that run counter to this system and will work collectively to foster global economic resilience against such actions”. The Quad would support neighbours in the Indo-Pacific region to “build resilience and counter disinformation”, it said. It would also assist countries in the region “to address the growing threat of ransomware, by strengthening capacity building to ensure resilient cyber security and to counter cybercrime”. A year after the military coup in Myanmar, the foreign ministers said they were “gravely” concerned about the crisis in the south-east Asian country. They called for “an end to violence, the release of all those arbitrarily detained, including foreigners, and unhindered humanitarian access”. The group also condemned North Korea for its “destabilising ballistic missile launches in violation of UN Security Council resolutions”. Earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, met with the visiting foreign ministers and said he appreciated their support as Australia weathered “coercion and pressure” from China. “We live in a very fragile, fragmented and contested world, and that is no more accentuated than here in our Indo-Pacific,” Morrison told the earlier meeting. Blinken said a confrontation with China was not inevitable, but “we share concerns that in recent years China has been acting more aggressively, a whole lot more aggressively in the region, and, indeed, potentially beyond”.",News/World news,"Russian aggression towards Ukraine could jeopardise Indo-Pacific stability, says US after Quad meeting",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/russian-aggression-towards-ukraine-could-jeopardise-indo-pacific-stability-says-us-after-quad-meeting
