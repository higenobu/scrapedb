1/11/2022,"The Australian Border Force is investigating whether Novak Djokovic incorrectly declared he had not travelled and would not do so for two weeks before his flight to Australia, in the latest twist in the tennis star’s visa cancellation saga. Questions have been raised about the declaration completed by an agent for Djokovic, with social media posts seemingly showing he was in Belgrade on Christmas Day before flying to Australia from Spain on 4 January.  On Tuesday the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, received a call from his Serbian counterpart, Ana Brnabić, in which he sought to manage the diplomatic fallout of the overturned visa cancellation by insisting Australia’s border policies were non-discriminatory. Despite a win in court restoring his visa on Monday, Djokovic’s fate will now be determined by Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, due to his personal power to again cancel the visa and deport the world’s No 1 male tennis star. Any decision to recancel the visa would likely be met by a fresh legal challenge from Djokovic, and a request for an injunction to stay out of immigration detention so that he could play in the Australian Open, where he is chasing a male record 21st grand slam singles title. In order to recancel the visa, Hawke would have to be satisfied of a ground for cancellation, such as a threat to public safety, and that cancellation is in the public interest. That could bring fresh scrutiny to Djokovic’s pre-travel declaration and his public appearances in the days after his positive Covid test result of 16 December. In his Australian traveller declaration, filed on 1 January, Djokovic declared “no” when asked: “Have you travelled or will you travel in the 14 days prior to your flight to Australia?”. The declaration is accompanied with a warning that giving false or misleading information is a “serious offence”, also punishable by civil penalties. In documents filed to the federal circuit court, Djokovic said that on 1 January he authorised his agent to submit this declaration, before travelling to Melbourne from Spain via Dubai on 4 January. In his interview with border force officials on 6 January Djokovic confirmed the declaration was completed by his agent, “based on” his Tennis Australia-approved medical exemption, but was not asked in the interview about travel in the fortnight before arrival. A Twitter post by a Portuguese tennis reporter, Jose Morgado, appears to show on Djokovic was in Belgrade at Christmas, posing with the handball star Petar Djordjic.

The travel declaration comes on top of reported anomalies on the official website showing Djokovic’s positive covid test, which was the basis for his claimed medical exemption from vaccination. Der Spiegel reported that the QR code linked to Djokovic’s Covid-19 test on 16 December, published in court documents on Monday, at times appeared to return a negative result. According to Der Spiegel, accessing Djokovic’s test result via QR code on Monday evening Australia time revealed a negative test result, before a subsequent attempt showed a positive result. The website returned only positive results when accessed by the Guardian on Tuesday. The New York Times reporter Ben Rothenberg similarly reported getting contradictory results from the same QR code. If Djokovic did travel before his flight it could arm the Australian government with fresh material to cancel his visa, on which no decision has yet been taken. A spokesman for Morrison said he had a “constructive call with prime minister Brnabić this morning on Novak Djokovic”. “The PM explained our non-discriminatory border policy and its role in protecting Australia during the Covid-19 pandemic. “They both agreed to stay in contact on the issue, and to further strengthening the bilateral relationship.” Views within the Australian government are mixed on whether it should enforce a zero tolerance approach on the requirement to be vaccinated and reject Djokovic’s exemption based on his recent Covid test result. While some Liberal MPs stress Djokovic’s good faith belief he had complied with requirements and the importance of his participation in the Australian Open, others believe procedural unfairness in the first decision to cancel his visa changes nothing in substance about the supposed risk to public health. Last week Morrison vacillated on the question, at first deferring to the Victorian state government about whether Djokovic should be allowed in without quarantine, before backflipping to declare “rules are rules” and the vaccination requirement must be enforced. In a statement on Tuesday the ATP tour said it although it fully respected Australia’s “stringent immigration policies” it was “clear Novak Djokovic believed he had been granted a necessary medical exemption in order to comply with entry regulations”. “The series of events leading to Monday’s court hearing have been damaging on all fronts, including for Novak’s well-being and preparation for the Australian Open.” Djokovic’s agent and lawyers have been contacted for comment.",Sport/Sport,Australian Border Force investigating whether Novak Djokovic made false travel claim,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/11/australian-border-force-investigating-whether-novak-djokovic-made-false-travel-claim
1/11/2022,"Over the past few weeks, holiday festivities have prised open the Covid floodgates. The Christmas season brought parties, festivals, family reunions with enthusiastic hugs, dinners, dancing and energetic karaoke sessions – an antidote to months of relentless doomscrolling and prolonged lockdowns – but Covid cases have now inevitably skyrocketed. Things have changed; we’re not in the same situation we were two years ago – 91% of the Australian population have had two jabs and nearly 3.9bn people have been fully vaccinated across the world.  We know, definitively, that vaccination drastically reduces the risk of getting really sick or dying from Covid and we have effective, evidence based treatments for the virus. Whilst breakthrough infections in vaccinated people can cause severe illness, it’s incredibly unlikely. Fewer than 0.5% of people with Covid in Australia are admitted to hospital and Covid-related mortality is very, very low. Though you still don’t want Covid if you can avoid it, chances are you’ll be OK if you can’t. Still, many Australians are having difficulty coming to terms recognising that avoiding Covid is no longer a feasible long-term option. It’s hard to get your head around the psychological U-turn from Covid zero to Covid everywhere when we’ve been told to stay home for two years to avoid the killer virus at all costs. Covid has been demonised in Australia for so long, compounded by the prolonged premise of “Covid zero”, a concept that was hopelessly naive at best and a dangerous political fallacy at worst. Much has already been said of the tidal wave of Covid-related mental distress that has been flooding through our emergency departments over the past few months. Now we have the addition of new infection-related health anxieties looming large, exacerbated by difficulties accessing reliable guidance or timely tests. The vast majority of people don’t need to be in the ED and are safe to convalesce at home, sufficed with paracetamol and ibuprofen, plenty of fluids and a Netflix subscription, but reassurance is challenging after months of fear-mongering rhetoric. It also goes against every gut instinct as healthcare professionals to advise people to think twice about coming to the ED if they’re sick or worried, but we know when to worry about Covid now. The pressures of this virulent outbreak on the health system and the need to preserve our critical care capacity have proved to be an additional insult to years of injurious underfunding and insufficient resources. The recent implementation of at-home rapid antigen testing is a welcome, albeit late, development. RATs work by identifying Covid antigens, the foreign structures containing the virus that trigger the body’s immune response. If Covid antigens are present on a RAT swab, the liquid solution helps them stick to a specific chemical on the paper strip and generate a positive result. Viral loads peak around five to seven days after infection, which correlates with when you’re most likely to have symptoms and so when your RAT is most likely to be reliable. However, if you don’t have an especially high viral load or enough antigens, a RAT will be negative even if you are in the early stages of infection. The levels of detectable antigen also change over time so yesterday’s negative RAT doesn’t explain away today’s nasty headache or tomorrow’s annoying cough. Though a positive RAT reliably tells us everything we need to know, a negative RAT rules out nothing. Conversely, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests essentially copy-and-paste genetic material from your swab until there’s enough material to look for the specific sequence of the Covid-19 virus. When a PCR test identifies the presence of Covid, it’s almost certainly accurate and so it’s better at detecting early or asymptomatic Covid. A single PCR test requires significant manpower, however, and costs at least $100 – 10 times more than a RAT. Whilst the sensitivity of PCRs are invaluable if you require hospital care, it is galling to think of how the cost of millions of PCRs could have been better spent in this pandemic if we’d had enough RATs sooner. Millions of dollars could have been redirected to better supporting and protecting our frontline healthcare workers, towards lockdown related psychological support for young people or on longer term solutions to tackling endemic poverty. I worked through the first two waves of the pandemic in an inner city London hospital hit ferociously hard by Covid in 2020. Our circumstances were in no way unique in the NHS; our oxygen pressures ran precariously low, we were forced to invent ICU spaces in the most creative of corners and we ran relentless rounds of futile resuscitation every night. The youngest person to die in our hospital was in her late 20s, the same age as me, with no underlying medical conditions. I think about her occasionally when I’m prescribing a young homeless lady sotrovimab or showing an elderly gentleman how to book his booster, because it’s difficult to convey how lucky we are in Australia even in our current state of crisis. Less than two years ago we had no viable treatment options on the horizon, confirming Covid infection took a couple of days and we didn’t even know if vaccination was a true possibility. Now, in 2022, it might feel like the cloud of doom overhead will linger forever but things are changing – we’re vaccinated, population immunity is rising. We need to keep protecting our vulnerable communities and emergency resources and keep testing, keep our space and keep our masks on just a little while longer.
