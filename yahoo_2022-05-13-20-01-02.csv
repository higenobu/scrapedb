5/13/2022,"Dividend Aristocrats are great places to be when the market waters get really rough. While they still get knocked down during bear markets, their dividends tend to offer a glimmer of certainty amid turbulent times. The payouts of Dividend Aristocrats have held up during past crashes, crises, and everything in between. With growing fear that we'll fall into a bear market and recession, insisting on quality may prove a wise decision. In this piece, we used TipRanks' Comparison Tool to evaluate three of the most enticing Dividend Aristocrats that have outpaced the broader S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. Chevron (CVX) Chevron is a big oil company that Warren Buffett has been loading up lately. Following the Oracle of Omaha's latest helping, Chevron is now a top-four holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. Year-to-date, shares of Chevron are up over 40%, much higher than the S&P 500, which is down around 18%. With the stock fluctuating at around $165 per share, the stock could be at risk of a pullback if the broader markets are able to find their footing. In any case, the reality of higher oil prices seems to be sinking in for many. With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, $100 per barrel of oil may be here to stay. If that's the case, Chevron will be rich with cash flow over the next 18 months. Though it's hard to chase a stock that's already taken off, it's worth noting that the valuation is still incredibly cheap. The stock trades at just 15.12 times trailing earnings, with a 3.5% dividend yield. It's not a mystery why Buffett likes the big oil firm. Energy stocks are one of the few places to hide from broader volatility, and Chevron is arguably one of the best of the bunch. With a healthy balance sheet and top-tier production growth, Chevron appears to be one of the Dividend Aristocrats that can keep powering higher, even in the face of a recession. Overall, CVX holds a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus view, based on 15 Buys, 8 Holds and 1 Sell. The stock’s $171.58 average price target indicates room for only 4% upside from the current share price of $164.71. (See CVX stock forecast on TipRanks) International Business Machines (IBM) IBM is an old-time technology company that's also held its own relatively well amid the market correction. Shares of IBM are up 2% year-to-date. While IBM's innovative capabilities may be subject to scrutiny, there's no denying the value and dividend yield—currently at 5.1%—to be had in the name. It's been years since Berkshire Hathaway has thrown in the towel on IBM. Though the low valuation metrics and high yield were present, the stock had continued to be a perennial underachiever - and it continues to be to this day. Shares are still down from their 2013 highs, even when adjusting for dividends. It's been around nine years, and the stock has still yet to recover. Moving ahead, there are reasons for optimism. The company's margin-dampening Kyndryl business has been spun off, and it could pave the way for margin expansion. Although IBM's latest first-quarter results beat by two pennies, management's guidance was quite encouraging. Still, it will be difficult for the firm to sustain a rally if an economic recession is approaching. Looking to Wall Street, analysts are bullish, with the average IBM price target of $152.11 implying 14.45% upside from today's levels. (See IBM stock forecast on TipRanks) Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson is another Dividend Aristocrat that's actually up ~5% year-to-date. The healthcare behemoth recently came off a modest earnings beat ($2.67 versus the $2.56 consensus) despite ongoing supply chain challenges. The Oncology segment saw 15% sales growth, led by Darzalex and Erleada. Looking ahead, the company expects Pharmaceutical revenues to be around $60 billion by 2025. The ambitious target is realistic and would fuel further dividend increases for investors, regardless of where the economy heads next. With minimal exposure to Ukraine and Russia, Johnson & Johnson has been minimally impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war. As a healthcare play, the company is also a great defensive for recessionary times. At writing, the stock trades at 23.8 times trailing earnings and around 5 times sales. With a mere 0.72 beta, JNJ stock is yet another Dividend Aristocrat that should continue outperforming the averages amid a downturn. The 2.55% dividend yield is modest, but it is incredibly safe and subject to growth over the years as the company looks to meet its 2025 top-line targets with or without a recession. Turning to the analyst community, opinions are split almost evenly. 6 Buys and 5 Holds add up to a Moderate Buy consensus rating. At $193.36, the average price target implies ~9% upside potential. (See JNJ stock forecast on TipRanks) Conclusion Dividend Aristocrats may very well be one of the best places to outpace the S&P 500 in a pretty ugly 2022. So far, they've fared well. Solid fundamentals should pave the way for more of the same. Currently, IBM stock has the highest implied upside potential at ~14%, while Chevron has the lowest at ~4%.

5/13/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter Inc. is facing more scrutiny in Washington following a report that the US Securities and Exchange Commission is probing whether he broke rules last month when disclosing a large stake in the social media platform. Most Read from Bloomberg Nike Escalates StockX Feud, Says Site Is Selling Fake Shoes Don’t Bother Paying Off Student Loan Debt Right Now, Advisers Say Crypto Billionaires’ Vast Fortunes Are Destroyed in Weeks Kim Orders Lockdown After North Korea Reports First Covid Case Ukraine Latest: Germany Can Withstand Gas Halt; US Eyes Drones The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that the SEC is investigating Musk’s submission of a form that investors must file when they accumulate more than 5% of a company. The Federal Trade Commission is also reviewing the bid by the world’s richest person to take Twitter private. Musk disclosed on April 4 that he acquired more than 9% in the company, a week later than regulations allow and by using a filing typically reserved for passive investors. He has since embarked on a highly-public takeover bid. An SEC spokesman declined to comment on the Journal report. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Inquiries by the SEC don’t always lead to the regulator taking action. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has been pressing to tighten rules for how investors must disclose they’ve taken a major stake in a company. He’s called for more transparency, and earlier this year proposed cutting the maximum time that an investor has to reveal they’d taken a significant position. Over the years the SEC has repeatedly sparred with the Tesla Inc. chief executive officer and was already investigating whether he and his brother violated insider trading rules when selling shares in the electric automaker late last year -- something Musk has denied. He’s also fighting the regulator in court over fallout from his infamous tweet that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. Musk, who reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for roughly $44 billion late last month, has said the San Francisco-based company has restricted user speech and wants to push it toward a more free-speech approach.

5/13/2022,"By Nivedita Balu (Reuters) -Elon Musk put his $44-billion deal for Twitter Inc ""temporarily on hold"" on Friday while he awaits data on the proportion of its fake accounts, sending the shares in the social media platform plunging. Twitter shares fell 17.7% to $37.10 in premarket trading, their lowest level since Musk disclosed his stake in the company in early April and subsequently made a ""best and final"" offer to take it private for $54.20 per share. Meanwhile, Tesla shares, against which Musk has secured $6.25 billion in funding for the acquisition, were up about 5%. ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,"" Musk told his more than 92 million Twitter followers on Friday. In his latest tweet, Musk referred to a Reuters story from May 2 that said Twitter had estimated that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users during the first quarter, when it recorded 229 million users who were served advertising. ""This 5% metric has been out for some time. He clearly would have already seen it... So it may well be more part of the strategy to lower the price,"" Susannah Streeter, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's going to be highly frustrating for many in the company given that a number of senior executives have already been laid off,"" she said. The implied probability of the deal closing at the agreed price fell below 50% for the first time on Tuesday, when Twitter shares dropped below $46.75. [nL5N2X20IT Musk, the world's richest man and a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist, had said that one of his priorities would be to remove ""spam bots"" from the platform. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk's representatives or his company Tesla Inc were not immediately available for a comment. Musk has been critical of Twitter's moderation policy. He has said he wants Twitter's algorithm to prioritize tweets to be public and was against too much power on the service to corporations that advertise. Earlier this week, he said he would reverse Twitter's ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump when he buys the social media platform, signaling his intention to cut moderation of the site. The social media company had said it faced several risks until the deal with Musk is closed, including whether advertisers would continue to spend on Twitter amid ""potential uncertainty regarding future plans and strategy."" Musk will have to pay a termination fee of $1 billion if he walks away from the deal.

5/13/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Money is leaving every asset class and the exodus is deepening as investors rush out of names like Apple Inc., according to Bank of America Corp. strategists. Most Read from Bloomberg Sony PlayStation Staff Fume Over CEO’s Abortion Comments Ukraine Latest: US Senator Delays Aid Vote; Russia Eyes Border More Than $200 Billion Wiped Off Cryptocurrency Market in a Day Crypto Billionaires’ Vast Fortunes Are Destroyed in Weeks Terraform Again Halts Blockchain Behind UST Stablecoin, Luna Equities, bonds, cash and gold all saw outflows in the week ended May 11, strategists led by Michael Hartnett wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. At $1.1 billion, technology stocks suffered their biggest withdrawals so far this year, second only to financials, which lost $2.6 billion. “The definition of true capitulation is investors selling what they love,” Hartnett said, citing Apple, big tech, the dollar and private equity. The meltdown in cryptocurrencies and speculative tech now rivals the internet bubble crash and the global financial crisis, he said. Apple, which was among the top stocks that led Wall Street’s main indexes to new highs after the pandemic-driven crash in 2020, is now trading in a bear market, falling nearly 10% this week alone. It’s a sudden turnaround for the company from even six weeks ago, when shares were close to a record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index is also poised for a sixth straight weekly drop, its longest such run since November 2012, as investors worry that hawkish central banks coinciding with high inflation would spark an economic slowdown. The benchmark S&P 500 is also flirting with bear market territory -- defined as a 20% drop from a record high -- and although BofA strategists said they expect a bounce in the short term, they still see room for stocks to fall further. “Fear and loathing suggest stocks are prone to an imminent bear market rally, but we do not think ultimate lows have been reached,” Hartnett wrote. The risk-off mood continued to hit all asset classes in the week. Outflows from equities were $6.2 billion, with a small inflow to US stocks outweighed by money exiting Europe and emerging markets. A total of $11.4 billion left bonds, while $19.7 billion exited cash and $1.8 billion departed gold. Outflows from funds buying investment-grade, junk-rated or emerging market debt hit $19.3 billion, marking the biggest exodus since April 2020. High-grade funds led outflows with $11.6 billion in pulled assets. On the other hand, safe Treasury bonds recorded their biggest inflow since March 2020.

5/13/2022,"There’s really no use denying the headwinds that are pushing the markets around these days. Persistently high inflation, slowing GDP growth, and a jobs market that, while expanding in absolute terms, is still down from pre-pandemic levels are feeding fears that we’re facing a round of ‘70’s-style stagflation. And these have combined with geopolitical factors – the Russia-Ukraine war, the resumption of severe lockdown policies in China – to ratchet up worries about recession in the near term. At the same time, there are reasons for hope. Oppenheimer’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus points those out, starting with the 1Q22 earnings release season. Stoltzfus reminds us that, as of last week, 87% of the S&P-listed firms have releases their Q1 data, and that 77% of them have surprised to the upside. Overall, earnings are up nearly 8% year-over-year, and revenues are up 14.2%. Looking ahead, Stoltzfus paints a picture for investors willing to look at the bright side of life. He writes of the path forward, “Over the course of this quarter we’d expect economic data and corporate news to persist in providing enough positive offsets to negative news as efforts by the Federal Reserve, the business community and the consumer to navigate the challenges at hand succeed in climbing the current proverbial wall of worry.” Navigating the challenges ahead is the chief task for every investor, from the smallest retail trader to the largest hedge fund manager. And to give a head start on that task, Oppenheimer’s equity analysts have picked out two stocks that may have bottomed out after losing heavily in the first part of the year. We’ve taken the details on both from the TipRanks database, and we’ll present it now, with commentary from some of Oppenheimer’s best stock pros. RingCentral (RNG) We’re starting with RingCentral, a communications-as-a-service software company specializing in bringing business communications solutions to the modern office. The company’s products include phone lines and extensions, video calling, screen sharing, and call forwarding, all offered through the cloud and compatible with Google Docs, Outlook, and Salesforce. RingCentral’s computerized telecom can accessed through desktop systems and mobile devices. As can be imagined, RingCentral’s business saw gains during the corona crisis. With work-from-home expanding, business communications were at a premium – and that’s reflected in RingCentral’s top line, which has grown sequentially every quarter for over two years now. In the most recent quarter reported, 1Q22, the company’s financial results beat the high-end guidance on all key metrics. Revenue was up 33% year-over-year to reach $468 million, driven by a 35% y/y increase in subscription revenue, which made up $440 million of the total. The company’s annualized recurring revenue came to $1.9 billion, also up 35% y/y. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS grew from 27 cents in the year-ago quarter to 39 cents in the current period. The company finished Q1 with $302 million in cash and liquid assets available, up 11.5% from the $267 million on hand at the end of 1Q21. Despite the solid earnings report, RNG shares are down 75% over the past year. Even though RingCentral has a sound business model, the company is facing increased competition from major market names like Microsoft and Cisco, and from niche competitors like Zoom. In addition, RingCentral has seen some churn in upper management recently, and earlier this week announced a new CFO, Sonalee Parekh, and a new President and COO, Mo Katibeh. Even with these pressures on the company, Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Timothy Horan writes of RNG: “The most important takeaways for the quarter is that its high quality service and features are enabling stable pricing/ARPU across the board, it is growing Teams uses very well at 500% YOY, it has 500K partner seats, and this growth is accelerating, while the company emphasizes a renewed focus on profitability.” At the bottom line, Horan says, “RingCentral should be a beneficiary of our very optimistic outlook on the overall cloud communications sector, which we predict (in a 50-page white paper) will grow fourfold to $100B within six years... The company has the highest quality service in the industry with the best go to market strategy as it has many of the incumbent PBX providers and telcos as partners.” Based on all of the above, Horan upgraded RNG from Perform (i.e. Neutral) to Outperform (i.e. Buy) and introduced a price target of $100. This would reflect gains of ~45% should the stock ultimately reach this target. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) If there’s one certainty in the markets, it’s that tech firms like RingCentral will get plenty of attention from the analysts. RNG shares have 24 recent reviews, breaking down 22 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds to back the Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $68.49 and its $142.57 average price target implies ~100% upside from that level. (See RNG stock forecast on TipRanks) SVB Financial Group (SIVB) And now we’ll turn to the California-based Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB Financial Group. This is a commercial bank focused on high-tech venture capital, and has provided funding for over 30,000 startups in the last 40 years. As of the end of 1Q22, SVB boasts $397 billion in total client funds, $220 billion in bank assets, and $69 billion in total loans. In April, SVB released its 1Q22 results, and beat the forecasts on both revenues and earnings. The top line, at $1.61 billion, came in 12% above estimates, and was up 14% year-over-year. At the bottom line, the diluted EPS of $7.92, while down from $10.03 in the year-ago quarter, beat the forecast of $5.60 by an impressive 41%. Even though this bank has been reporting strong profits and beating the analyst forecasts, the shares are down 38% from the peak they hit in November of last year. It’s important to note that SVB has a high exposure to the tech sector, and that high tech stocks generally have come under heavy pressure over the past 6 months. Despite the banks current share price weakness, Chris Kotowski, another of Oppenheimer’s 5-star analysts, believes ""investors should take advantage of this weakness."" and he upgrades SIVB from Perform (i.e. Neutral) to Outperform (i.e. Buy). Kotowski also sets a $702 price target on this stock, suggesting a 50% upside potential. (To watch Kotowski’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Kotowski writes: “Following recently announced 1Q22 results, we raised our 2023 EPS estimate from $38.94 to $46.75. In addition to the strong underlying growth, SIVB is very asset sensitive and should benefit significantly from rising rates as its business model generates a lot of demand deposits. Depending on what timeframe one looks at, SIVB has historically traded between a 90% and 117% relative P/E to the market, and our price target is based on a 90% relative P/E.” Silicon Valley denizens can usually count on plenty of attention from the Street, and this bank is no exception. There are 19 recent analyst reviews here, including 16 to Buy and 3 to Hold for a Strong Buy consensus view. The average price target of $721.76 is slightly more bullish than the Oppenheimer view, and implies ~54% upside from the current share price of $469.03.
