Unprecedented sanctions against Russia's banks over its invasion of Ukraine are taking a toll on its citizens overseas, who have been left scrambling to find cash or turn to crypto transactions to get by. ""This has created a huge problem for us. We have been left completely stripped of our finances - its like they have been completely frozen and we cannot use them at all over here,” said Ivanov, 27, adding that he might have to look for a job in Indonesia. The Russian embassy in the capital Jakarta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bali is a popular holiday destination with Russian tourists, who flocked to the island by the tens of thousands before the pandemic and were among the first to return when borders partially reopened last year. About 1,150 Russians entered Indonesia in January 2022, according to data from the statistics bureau. Rifki Saldi Yanto, the manager of a local cafe, said he had noticed a decline in Russian customers in recent days and many now pay with cash instead of credit card. Meanwhile more than 7,000 Russians were stranded in Thailand, another popular beach destination because of flight cancellations, a rouble currency in free-fall and payment issues.

3/10/2022,"Russia has warned it will respond to what it describes as Nato's ""provocative"" deployment of soldiers and military hardware near its border. Nato has been gathering troops in a number of its member states in recent weeks after Vladimir Putin began amassing his own soldiers on the Ukrainian border before launching a full-scale invasion two weeks ago. Nato members have so far rejected Ukrainian pleas to establish a no-fly zone over its skies, making it clear that any such move could provoke direct engagement with Russian military jets that could in turn spark a wider war. Troops are currently based in the eastern European countries of Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Moscow has frequently accused Nato of provocation, despite repeated assurances that the alliance is a defensive one and poses no threat to Russians. On Wednesday, the Russian foreign ministry stoked tensions further. ""The build-up of NATO forces on the “eastern flank” is openly provocative,"" it said. ""The containment of Russia has obviously become the alliance's main mission again. ""We will respond to the confrontation policy pursued by #NATO towards our country."" Ukraine has stated as recently as last month that joining Nato to bolster its security is a key ambition. Putin is said to be angered by such a move and Russia has stated that Ukraine must ""enshrine its neutrality"" before any ceasefire can be brokered.

In response, President Volodymyr Zelensky appeared to suggest he would no longer seek membership, telling ABC News on Monday: ""I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that ... NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine."" He added he did not want to be president of a ""country which is begging for something on its knees."" Ukraine has also appealed to Nato to supply fighter jets to help with their efforts in holding off Russian forces. On Tuesday, Poland said it was ready to deploy all its MIG-29 jets to Rammstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the United States However, the Pentagon dismissed the proposed solution as ""untenable"" saying the prospect of the jets' departing from a US and Nato base in Germany ""to fly into airspace that is contested with Russia over Ukraine raises serious concerns for the entire Nato alliance"". Putin's actions have now driven 2 million people out of Ukraine and into neighbouring countries as refugees, the UN said on Tuesday. It is is the largest humanitarian crisis since World War Two. US intelligence authorities warned on Tuesday that Putin could decide to leave Ukraine if his efforts to take over are continually stalled, but warned he could double down on the violence before deciding to. “We assess Putin feels aggrieved the West does not give him proper deference and perceives this as a war he cannot afford to lose.

3/10/2022,"(Reuters) - China has refused to supply Russian airlines with aircraft parts, an official at Russia's aviation authority was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying on Thursday, after Boeing and Airbus halted supply of components. Russia's aviation sector is being squeezed by Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, with Russia's foreign ministry warning this week that the safety of Russian passenger flights was under threat. Agencies including Interfax quoted Valery Kudinov, a Rosaviatsia official responsible for maintaining airplane airworthiness, as saying that Russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including Turkey and India after a failed attempt to obtain them from China. He also said Russian companies were registering their planes, many of which had been registered abroad, in Russia after the U.S. and European Union sanctions on aviation and that he expects some others to be returned to leasing companies. Separately, a draft law published on Thursday showed the Russian government plans to order domestic airlines to pay for leased aircraft in roubles and could bar them from returning planes to foreign companies if leases are cancelled.

3/10/2022,"Two former intensive care nurses at Mount Carmel Health testified Wednesday that in 2017 they each administered large doses of fentanyl to the same patient about 20 minutes apart at the direction of former doctor William Husel. The second nurse testified in the murder trial of former doctor William Husel that he was unaware that his colleague had earlier given the same dosage of 1,000 micrograms to the patient. Both dosages were prescribed by Husel, who was the attending physician at the time for Ryan Hayes, 39, an overdose patient who was considered comatose during his two-day admittance to the hospital. Tyler Springer testified that on April 3, 2017, he had no idea that 20 minutes earlier, his nurse colleague Troy Rudman had administered the same dosage to Hayes. Mount Carmel deaths: Former Mount Carmel executive says Husel was only doctor ordering high fentanyl doses Springer testified that he recalled the Hayes case as memorable, without reviewing medical records, because ""it was the highest amount of medication that I had (ever) given."" Springer also testified that he recorded Hayes' pain as '0' on a 1-10 scale for several hours leading up to the fentanyl dosage. During the removal of Hayes' breathing tube at about 11:15 p.m., Springer said he had changed the pain score to '10,' anticipating that removing the breathing tube would be uncomfortable. ""I anticipated that he had pain. I noticed that he was turning blue,"" he said. Previous doctors have testified that fentanyl, if used at all, would be administered in smaller dosages over a period of time for pain relief only — and not in one intravenous dosage as Husel had prescribed, in this case twice. On cross-examination, Diane Menashe, one of Husel's defense attorneys, asked if Springer noted that Springer injected the fentanyl in a single dosage prior to logging the highest possible pain score. She asked Springer if he would ever assign a patient a pain score if he didn't believe it was warranted. Springer agreed that he would only do so if warranted. William Husel drug dosages: Husel colleague at Mount Carmel ICU says she never overrode drug doses in end-of-life care Menashe asked both nurses if they like Husel, and if he was responsive to change and easy to work with. Both replied yes. ""Is it fair to say that he was approachable? Accessible? Willing to take the time to take questions and to answer them?"" Rudman replied yes to each. Rudman had worked with Husel on more than 50 palliative exhubations, where patients breathing tubes are removed, and that in each case he was there in his role as a rapid response nurse. ""Any time I was called it was for some emergency,"" Rudman said. He testified that he frequently overrode the monitoring and dispensing machines, bypassing oversight by pharmacists, because of the emergency status and at Husel's direction. Menashe asked both nurses if they recognized whether different doctors have different techniques. Both agreed. Both nurses were among a dozen or so employees eventually fired by Mount Carmel in the wake of the Husel scandal, which a hospital investigation determined involved the deaths of more than 30 patients. The two nurses are still licensed but now working in different fields. Husel was initially charged with 25 counts of murder by then-Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien. But Gary Tyack, a Democrat elected in 2020 to replace Republican O'Brien, directed the withdrawal before trial of 11 counts, leaving the current 14 counts the former doctor is now facing at trial. Testimony indicated Hayes had arrived at Mount Carmel in full cardiac arrest after being found in a bathtub. His son drove from North Carolina that day and, en route, agreed to the removal of his father's breathing tube. In afternoon testimony, Stephanie LeChard, another former night shift nurse at the hospital, recalled giving an 80-year-old patient a 1,000-microgram dose of fentanyl and being told by colleagues that it was appropriate. ""Dr. Husel told me to draw it up in a different room,"" LeChard said ... ""just for the comfort of the family."" Asked what Husel meant by that, defense attorneys objected, stating that LeChard's answer would be speculation. LeChard testified that the patient was ""gurgling loudly, grimacing in pain and had a tear running down her cheek,"" and discussed the agony her family was going through. Shortly after administering the dosage, she said, ""The patient looked more comfortable... a little more relaxed."" The patient, Sandra Castle, died shortly after being given the single, intravenous dose. dnarciso@dispatch.com @DeanNarciso This article originally appeared on The Columbus Dispatch: Former nurses: William Husel ordered 2 large fentanyl doses",Health/The Columbus Dispatch,Nurses say they gave fentanyl doses to same patient 20 minutes apart at Husel's direction,https://news.yahoo.com/nurses-gave-fentanyl-doses-same-210809218.html
3/10/2022,"The crew of the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov's superyacht was fired on Monday, reports said. The company that staffed the boat said sanctions meant crew wages couldn't be paid, Forbes reported. Usmanov's estimated worth is $18.4 billion, and his yacht is valued at $600 million to $735 million. The crew of the Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov's 512-foot superyacht was fired after Western sanctions prevented wages from being paid to the vessel's staff, multiple outlets reported. Sarnia Yachts, a yacht-management company in the UK that provided the crew for the $600 million vessel, Dilbar, said in an email to staff on Monday that ""normal operation of the yacht has ceased,"" and that its crew had to be dismissed ""as a result of the sanctions imposed,"" Forbes reported. The West has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia, with the aim of crippling its economy and cutting off its military's funding, in an attempt to pressure President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine. The West has imposed sanctions not only on Russian banks but also on Russian elites and oligarchs, and they include the seizure of assets such as private jets and superyachts. The European Union, UK, US, and Switzerland have all sanctioned Usmanov, freezing his assets and, in some cases, barring him from entering their territory. The EU said Usmanov ""actively supported"" the Russian government's policies of the destabilization of Ukraine. Usmanov is worth an estimated $18.4 billion, the UK government said. He is the founder of USM Holdings, which has interests in metals, mining, and telecoms. His largest holding is in the Russian steel giant Metalloinvest. The European Union said he had ""particularly close ties"" to the Kremlin, calling him one of ""Putin's favorite oligarchs."" The US has declared Dilbar ""blocked property,"" which prohibits US staff from working on the vessel and bans the payment for its docking fees in US dollars. Sarnia said in Monday's email to staff that the sanctions meant that some of the companies supporting Dilbar's crew were ""unable to continue their normal lines of business,"" Forbes reported. Sarnia added that it was unable to continue paying salaries to the ship's crew, and that their final wages would instead be paid by the boat's owner, Forbes said. ""We have tried all avenues to find a solution to keep the team in place, and protect our positions, but have reached the end of the road of possibilities,"" Tim Armstrong, the yacht's captain, wrote in a message to the crew, Bloomberg reported. The US Treasury said Dilbar's estimated value was between $600 million and $735 million, and that it cost an estimated $60 million per year to run. Its builder, Lürssen, says it's the ""largest motor yacht in the world by gross tonnage."" The vessel is equipped with two helicopter pads and has its own 82-foot swimming pool. Forbes reported that the ship usually had 96 crew members on board, while Bloomberg put the figure at 80. Sarnia said in the email to the crew that a small number of staff from Lürssen, which owns the Hamburg shipyard where Dilbar has been docked for a refitting since October, would instead look after the ""safety and security"" of the ship, Forbes reported. Forbes also reported that Dilbar had been seized by German authorities on March 2, but it issued a correction the following day that said the ship hadn't been impounded. Hamburg's Ministry for Economy and Innovation told Bloomberg that Dilbar wouldn't be able to leave the port until it received an export waiver from Germany's federal customs agency. Lürssen declined to comment. Sarnia Yachts and Hamburg's Ministry for Economy and Innovation did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

3/10/2022,"Half measures are for the half-hearted. If President Biden and other democratic leaders around the world are really going to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his brutal invasion of Ukraine, then it’s time to apply the muscle needed to clip his power permanently and smash his ability to wreak destruction wherever he chooses. The way to corral Putin is with robust energy sanctions that will raise prices even more and cause genuine hardship for millions outside of Russia—but pay off in the end. That should be combined with resolute but careful military support, including covert aid. Biden and the leaders of allied nations in Europe, Asia and elsewhere will have to explain coming sacrifices to their people and find ways to rally them if success isn’t quick. Military hawks want the NATO military alliance to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine and confront Russian forces militarily. This is unclever and dangerous and likely to be backfire. Armchair generals should read up on what it takes to establish a no-fly zone over a country the size of Texas. It would be a massive mobilization almost certainly involving losses of NATO aircraft and personnel Russia would be able to target with stand-off weapons. It would also require NATO airstrikes inside Russian territory, to disable air-defense systems that reach into Ukraine. That would give Putin exactly the justification he’s looking for to characterize his demonic jihad as a reaction to NATO aggression. It would also give him the pretext for using tactical nuclear weapons, if he’s willing to go that far. It's easy to understand why Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky continually asks NATO to establish a no-fly zone to limit the Russian bombs and missiles killing civilians and wrecking schools, hospitals, apartment buildings and government offices. But Zelensky must know NATO is not going to do this, since every Western leader commenting on the idea has ruled it out. It’s possible this is a deliberate feint, of sorts: Zelensky keeps asking for an escalation that would undoubtedly trigger Putin, while NATO and other friendly nations keep saying no, while slipping Ukraine other types of military aid that’s a little less escalatory. Know-it-all war commentators should keep in mind there’s always stuff going on behind the scenes during a military conflict. Several nations, including the United States, are rushing defensive weapons into Ukraine, including missiles able to destroy tanks and aircraft. Turkey is sending armed drones that already seem to have helped take out scores of Russian vehicles. This should continue as long as necessary. Ukraine’s own army has so far shown remarkable resolve and more capability than most analysts expected. Build on that for as long as it takes. [Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or send in your thoughts.] Russia, meanwhile, has revealed some major weaknesses that must alarm Putin, if he’s sane. The most startling is a creaky army that can’t get the job done. Battlefield reports should always be viewed skeptically, yet there seem to be numerous instances in which the long Russia army columns heading toward the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and other cities are stuck for lack of fuel, food and spare parts. Some captured Russian conscripts say they thought they were going to training exercises rather than invading a neighboring country. The mark of a professional military isn’t fancy weapons that shine in parades. It’s logistical competence under stress and discipline among troops who know what the mission is. Russia still has massive amounts of firepower in Ukraine and select units of elite troops, and could regroup. But some of its weaknesses are astonishing. Tanks seem reluctant to leave blacktop roads, for instance, as if they fear bogging down in mud. That makes thousands of Russian vehicles in stalled convoys sitting ducks for any weapon that can get to them. Russia could shut down digital and communication networks in Ukraine, but it hasn’t, possibly because it needs them for its own battlefield communications. Vulnerabilities seem to be everywhere. Putin supposedly rebuilt this force from the tattered remnants of the Soviet Union’s Red Army, financing it with billions in revenue every year from oil and gas sales to the rest of the world. Yet everybody knows Russia is a kleptocracy with officials and businessmen at every level, from Putin on down, siphoning off as much national wealth as they can get for themselves. This story is incomplete, but it now seems corruption and graft have left Putin with a hollow army. Put to the test, it’s turning out to be a flabby spear for Putin to attack his neighbors with. This is the army Putin built with his nation participating fully in the world’s oil and gas markets. So imagine how feeble it would become if Putin lost access to that money, in a sustained way that left him nowhere to turn, not even to his fellow dictators in China. This is where the United States and Europe are heading, and they should inflict maximum financial pain on Putin now that he has shown these glaring vulnerabilities. On March 8, Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil and natural gas, with the apparent blessing of Congress. The United States doesn’t buy much Russian energy, and this won’t hurt Putin much. But Biden has set the tone for other nations that need Russian energy a lot more to pass their own bans or at least cut back on Russian energy purchases. On the same day, the United Kingdom said it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, and the European Union said it planned to cut purchases of Russian gas by two-thirds in the same time frame. By 2030, the EU said, it planned to completely end its reliance on Russian gas. Europe buys far more Russian energy than the United States does, and losing Europe as a customer would be crushing to Russia. It will also be hard on Europeans, whose energy bills are already way higher than those in America. They will go higher still. While government sanctions are beginning to squeeze Putin’s war financing, so is the market. Many private-sector purchasers of Russian energy now can’t buy it even if they want to, because sanctions on the financial system make purchase transactions difficult or impossible. Until now, Russia’s giant energy firms have been reliable business partners delivering their product almost regardless of what else is going on. But Putin has wrecked that, too. “Russia has proved it’s not a reliable business partner,” Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, said in a March 8 call with clients. “Even if there’s some conclusion to the war, there will be some desire to limit exposure to Russia.” Putin and the oligarchs dependent on him for their wealth will seek every possible way to evade sanctions. They’ll find some holes, for sure. This is where Europe and the United States and other allied nations must now make it a strategic, long-term national-security priority to boycott Russian energy for as long as Putin remains in power. Anybody who ever doubted that Putin is a bully undeterred by diplomacy can now see plainly that he will murder civilians and destroy nations to fulfill his egomaniacal ambition as long as he has the power to do so. His missteps in Ukraine now reveal how to torpedo that power. Let Putin continue to rule Russia. Regime change in Russia should not be a public or secret goal of any Western nation. If Putin’s enemies in the Kremlin want to give assassination a shot, that’s their business. But the clear goal of the United States and the full slate of other nations confronting Russia should be the surrender of Ukraine back to Ukrainians, the diminution of Russian military power and a lock on the ATM that enriches Putin and his minions. Putin can have whatever is left after that.

3/10/2022,"Warning: This article contains links to video that some viewers may find disturbing.

A video that captured what appears to be Chinese health workers bludgeoning a quarantined woman’s pet to death has gone viral in China.

In a Weibo post on March 4, pet owner Yi Zhi Xue Qiu of the city of Huizhou in Guangdong Province accused the health officials of beating her 3-year-old dog Snowball to death. She posted CCTV footage of the incident prove her accusation.

Qiu was reportedly sent to a quarantine facility on March 2 after her boyfriend tested positive for COVID-19.

According to Qiu, she was forced to leave Snowball since she could not bring any pets with her. She was informed that health workers would disinfect her apartment while she was away.



In the video she shared on Weibo, two workers in protective gear can be seen carrying metal rods and approaching a barking, frightened dog, who attempts to back away. It did not take long for the workers to subdue the small animal by beating it several times with their rods. They immediately leave the room after killing Qiu’s dog.

In her post, Qiu also shared screenshots of her conversation with the workers. She had told them about Snowball, letting them know that the dog was not aggressive and would not cause them any harm.

""Snowball is like family to me,” she wrote in Chinese. “Without this CCTV evidence, we might still be deceived that our pet was 'humanely' put down. I was told by anti-epidemic officials that they would just be disinfecting my home, not killing my dog. Who gave them the right to do that? I also applied and pleaded for the dog to just be sent into quarantine with me, but no one gave me that chance.”

Qiu lamented that she and her boyfriend mourned their dog’s untimely death, spending the past days “in endless regrets and pains.”

“We raised a dog together for three years and three months,” she added. “It was already part of our family, but now he died tragically in his own home.""

An official statement from local authorities acknowledged the incident and noted that the health officials have been suspended.

""We have apologized to the dog owner and will counsel and suspend the workers,"" the statement read.

Qiu’s post has sparked anger among social media users, with many calling for justice over Snowball’s death. Chinese tech influencer Naomi Wu was among those who called for the incarceration of the workers.

3/10/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry acknowledged on Wednesday that some conscripts were taking part in the conflict with Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin denied this on various occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in. The ministry said that some of them, serving in supply units, had been taken prisoner by the Ukrainian army since the fighting began on Feb. 24. Citing Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, the RIA news agency said Putin had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts from the operation. Some associations of soldiers' mothers in Russia had raised concerns about a number of conscripts going incommunicado at the start of what Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, suggesting they could have been sent to fight despite a lack of adequate training. The Kremlin and military authorities had denied it until now. Last week, Russia's parliament passed a law imposing a prison term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. ""Unfortunately, we have discovered several facts of the presence of conscripts in units taking part in the special military operation in Ukraine. Practically all such soldiers have been pulled out to Russia,"" the defence ministry said, promising to prevent such situations in the future. One mother of a conscript, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said her 19-year-old son's military unit was sent south to the Russian city of Kursk soon after he started his military service and was then moved to Belgorod, a town closer to the Ukrainian border, for training. She says that judging by the few phone calls she had received, he had not yet been deployed into Ukraine and had not signed a contract to do so.

3/10/2022,"Russian military vehicles and equipment are still moving near the Antonov Airport, where a portion of a large military convoy was photographed Feb. 28, according to satellite images released Tuesday by Maxar Technologies. A senior U.S. defense official said Tuesday the convoy has not advanced beyond the airport in Hostomel, which is about 30 kilometers outside downtown Kyiv. The official noted that assessments show Russian forces are trying to reach Kyiv through other directions. Maxar Technologies has been tracking Russian military movements around Ukraine through satellite images since late last year, recently releasing photos that showed a large military convoy traveling toward the capital city of Kyiv and spanning nearly 40 miles of road. Clouds covered a large section of the area where the convoy was last seen, according to Maxar, but images taken Tuesday show armored vehicles and equipment moving near the Antonov Airport near Hostomel. A portion of the convoy was previously photographed in the same area on Feb. 28. Additional images released Tuesday show craters, which a Maxar spokesman said are from bombs, and a damaged bridge in Irpin, west of Kyiv. Ukrainians have been crossing the Irpin River on an improvised path underneath the bridge, which The Associated Press reported was destroyed by a Russian airstrike, in order to evacuate. Ukrainian officials told the Associated Press that a safe evacuation corridor opened from Irpin on Tuesday, but it is unclear how long it was open or how many people used it. Previous agreements for safe evacuation corridors have failed, with Ukraine claiming Russia violated ceasefire agreements. The Russian military denied firing on convoys. Two million Ukrainian refugees have left the country in the 12 days since the Russian invaded started, according to the UN Refugee Agency, with more than half traveling to Poland. “The refugees who have crossed are safe from the violence, but none were spared huge loss and trauma. Behind the monolithic statistics are 2 million stories of separation, anguish, and loss,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in a statement. U.S. defense officials estimate more than 600 Russian missiles have been fired from Russia or inside Ukraine since Russia invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24.",World/Air Force Times,"Russian military equipment, damaged bridge seen in satellite images",https://news.yahoo.com/russian-military-equipment-damaged-bridge-001320683.html

The skyscraper houses The Trump Organization and his three-story penthouse. Donald Trump has refinanced the $100 million dollar mortgage on his flagship Manhattan skyscraper, Trump Tower, according to New York City records. The lender is Axos Bank in San Diego; the bank CEO, Greg Garrabrants, donated some $50,000 to Republican campaigns since 2012; $9,600 in donations supported Trump, according to federal election records. The refinancing was first reported Wednesday by Forbes which noted the previous $100 million dollar loan on the property had been scheduled to come due in September. Last September, that loan was placed on a debt watch list after Wells Fargo, the loan's master servicer, said occupancy had dipped to 78.9% from 85.9% at the end of 2020. Multiple tenants had at that point fallen behind on rent, including Marc Fisher Footwear, which had manufactured Ivanka Trump's shoe line on the tower's 21st and 22nd floors. The skyscraper houses Trump's three story penthouse and the offices of his real estate company, The Trump Organization.

3/10/2022,"As the war in Ukraine rages on, a defiant Ukrainian General has sent out a stark warning to Russian troops entering the country. Vladimir Putin's soldiers in Mykolaiv, a key staging post for control of the Black Sea, have been met with fierce resistance, putting an early end to Russia’s attempt at advancing. General Dmytro Marchenko, of Ukraine’s Armed Forces, has now told The Times that Ukrainian resistance is not phased by Russian soldiers continuing with their bombardment. He said: “It’s unpleasant to say this but their corpses are food for stray dogs. “We’re not able to retrieve them because of continuing Russian fire in those areas.” Marchenko insisted that Ukrainian troops “won’t shoot any Russian soldiers who give up” but warned: “The rest of them will become dog food.” While troops have been forced to a retreat in Mykolaiv, Vladimir Putin continues his deadly onslaught in other parts of the country – including striking at maternity hospital in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as an “atrocity” and reiterated his call to Western nations to impose a no-fly zone. Watch: Mykolaiv mayor gives update on his besieged city Mayor of Mykolaiv Oleksandr Syenkevych gives an update from his city on the Black Sea coast. On Monday, Russian military forces opened fire on Mykolaiv, according to Ukraine's General Staff. Boris Johnson described the attach as “depraved” and said the UK was considering more support for Ukraine to defend itself against airstrikes. Mariupol deputy mayor Sergei Orlov said this morning that at least three people had been killed in the strike, including a six-year-old child. Around 17 people were reportedly injured in the strike against the hospital, where the vast majority of patients are pregnant women – many of whom were in labour. Defence minister James Heappey accused Russia of committing a war crime by striking the hospital, telling BBC Breakfast this morning: “We ask ourselves the question how did this happen? Was it an indiscriminate use of artillery or missiles into a built-up area, or was a hospital explicitly targeted? “Both are equally despicable, both, as the Ukrainians have pointed out, would amount to a war crime.” Pressed on whether he thinks the attack constitutes a war crime, he replied: “Yes, if you deliberately target a piece of civilian infrastructure like a hospital, yes. “If you use indiscriminate artillery into an urban area without due regard for the reality, you could hit a protected site like a hospital, then that too in my view is.” President Zelenskyy posted footage online showing the damage from what he said was a “direct strike” on the hospital, with windows blown out and debris strewn through the corridors. In a call on Wednesday evening, Johnson joined Zelenskyy in condemning the strike, noting that this, together with reports Russian forces had failed to respect ceasefire agreements, was “yet further evidence that Putin was acting with careless disregard for international humanitarian law”, Downing Street said.",World/Yahoo News UK,Invading Russian troops 'will be dog food' insists defiant Ukrainian general,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-criris-invading-russian-troops-dog-food-dmytro-marchenko-111603411.html
3/10/2022,"On Hannity Wednesday, Fox News National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin appeared where she addressed recent Russian propaganda. Russia has recently claimed that the U.S. is running secret bioweapon labs in Ukraine. “In terms of Ukraine’s biolabs, which have come under scrutiny tonight,” Griffin said, “those are Soviet-era bio-labs that the U.S. has been engaged [with] since 2005 in trying to help Ukraine convert the research facilities safely.” Griffin spoke of the concern among some U.S. officials that Russia is doing this now as a pretext to their own use of these types of weapons as their invasion of Ukraine continues. “White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Moscow’s talk today about these biolabs has led to concern by U.S. intelligence,” Griffin said, “that Russia could use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine to create a false flag operation using them.” Griffin’s reporting on the matter differed greatly from what opinion host Tucker Carlson said on his show an hour earlier. Carlson, who has been accused on multiple occasions of pushing Russian propaganda, used the admission by Under Secretary of State Victoria Nuland that there are biological research labs in Ukraine as a reason to push the same narrative as Russia. “Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe,” Carlson said. “It’s hardly a hotbed of biomedical research. We’re assuming these weren’t pharmaceutical labs. Probably not developing new leukemia drugs. From your answer, Victoria Nuland, we would assume, because you all but said it, there’s a military application of this research. They’re working on bioweapons.” But Griffin said that the knowledge of these labs is neither secret nor new. “It is a long program that has existed, where the Pentagon has partnered with these biolabs,” Griffin said, adding, “The U.S. has been very open about its involvement there with that. But what Russia does is they take that information, distort it, turn it around and turn it into disinformation.” JENNIFER GRIFFIN: In terms of Ukraine's bio labs which have come under scrutiny tonight, those are Soviet-era biolabs that the US has been engaged since 2005 in trying to help Ukraine convert the research facilities safely. KYLIE MAR: Jennifer Griffin, a national security correspondent at Fox News, appeared on ""Hannity"" Wednesday, where she addressed recent Russian propaganda claiming that the US has secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

KYLIE MAR: Griffin's reporting of the Russian claims stood in sharp contrast to what opinion host Tucker Carlson said on his show an hour earlier.

3/10/2022,"Oligarch Leonid Nevzlin publicly renounced his Russian citizenship on Tuesday. The former oil tycoon fled Russia almost 20 years ago, claiming political persecution by Putin. He joins a handful of oligarchs breaking ranks to speak out against the Ukraine war. Leonid Nevzlin, an oligarch and former oil tycoon, renounced his Russian citizenship in a Facebook post on Tuesday. He joins a small but growing group of Russian elites breaking ranks to speak out against the war on Ukraine. ""Russian citizenship has become a stamp of shame which I no longer want to wear. Enough is enough,"" Nevzlin wrote in the post. ""I am against the war. I am against the occupation. I am against the genocide of the Ukrainian people."" ""I cannot afford to be a citizen of a country that kills children of other countries,"" he continued. But Nevzlin's ""removal"" of his citizenship is likely more symbolic than legally binding. Formal renunciation can take anywhere from six to 12 months, according to SRAS. Nevzlin co-founded the Russian oil giant Yukos with fellow oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent nearly a decade in a Russian prison following charges of fraud and tax evasion in 2005. During the Yukos investigation, Nevzlin fled to Israel, claiming he was the victim of political persecution. In 2008, Nevzlin was sentenced to life in prison for murder and financial crimes, charges which he has repeatedly denied. Israel has refused Russia's extradition request. ""I was one of the first to be hit by Putin. He threw my friends in jails, and killed some of them,"" Nevzlin wrote. ""Everything Putin touches dies."" Khodorkovsky, his former business partner, is also an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Last week, he told CNN that Putin's invasion of Ukraine has ""significantly reduced"" his chances of remaining in power. Sanctioned Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman, Oleg Deripaska, Pyotr Aven, and Alexei Mordashov have similarly called for peace in Ukraine. Steel tycoon Vladimir Lisin, who has avoided sanctions thus far, urged Putin to diplomatically end the war in a letter to his employees.

3/10/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday shifted its stance over the bombing of a Ukrainian hospital in the city of Mariupol, with a mix of statements that veered between aggressive denials and a call by the Kremlin to establish clear facts. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy said three people including a child had been killed in the bombing on Wednesday, and rejected Russian assertions there had been no patients there. ""Like always, they lie confidently,"" said Zelenskiy, who has accused Moscow of waging genocide in the war it launched two weeks ago. In the face of worldwide condemnation there were rare signs of inconsistency in the response from Russian officials, who since the start of Moscow's invasion on Feb. 24 have stuck tightly to the same narrative for what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked for comment in the immediate aftermath, told Reuters on Wednesday: ""Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets."" On Thursday he said the Kremlin would look into the incident. ""We will definitely ask our military, because you and I don't have clear information about what happened there,"" Peskov told reporters. ""And the military are very likely to provide some information."" Other Russian officials took a more aggressive line, rejecting the hospital bombing as fake news. ""This is information terrorism,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov attacked what he called ""pathetic shouting about so-called atrocities by the Russian armed forces"". He told reporters after meeting Ukraine's foreign minister in Turkey that the hospital building had for days been under the control of ultra-radical Ukrainian forces who had emptied out the doctors and patients - the version rejected by Zelenskiy as a lie. Moscow says it is conducting a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and the West reject these as false pretexts for an invasion of a democratic country of 44 million people. On Wednesday, the United States denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"".

3/10/2022,"Russian companies and banks are turning to China's currency, the yuan (also known as the renminbi), as the doors to the U.S. dollar-based global financial system slam shut due to sanctions. Why it matters: The sanctions on Russia ""incrementally help internationalize the renminbi,"" James Fok, author of the book ""Financial Cold War: A View of Sino-US Relations from the Financial Markets,"" told Axios. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. ""But that doesn't mean the renminbi is going to suddenly start rivaling the dollar in any meaningful way. In order for it to do so, you have a lot of other pieces that have to fall into place,"" Fok said. What's happening: Russian companies are rushing to Chinese banks to inquire about opening accounts, Reuters reports. FESCO Transportation Group, a Russian logistics company, told customers last week that it would accept payment in yuan. After Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in Russia, some Russian banks are considering switching to UnionPay, China's state-owned card payments system. Zoom out: China's leaders chafe at U.S. financial hegemony and have pursued policies aimed at internationalizing the yuan, such as successfully advocating for its inclusion in the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights basket in 2016, an important international reserve. Yes, but: China's push toward internationalization of the yuan over the past decade has been half-hearted at best, with less than 2% of global payments using yuan. Beijing is reluctant to relinquish control over the currency, and it does not want to bear the potential ill effects of having a globally dominant currency. The government's tight capital controls make it difficult to move assets out of China, which discourages international yuan transactions. State of play: Despite Russian interest, Chinese banks are wary of the risk of U.S. secondary sanctions, meaning the U.S. government's ability to penalize non-U.S. companies that do business with sanctioned entities. What to watch: The sanctions ""will certainly mean that the Russians will end up holding more renminbi,"" Fok said. But for other countries to be willing to conduct more transactions in yuan, the Chinese government would need to relax capital controls and improve rule of law — or a splintering of the global financial system would have to occur to make the yuan seem more appealing in comparison.

3/10/2022,"More than two dozen foreign policy experts have called for the United States and NATO to institute a partial no-fly zone over Ukraine, which would serve as an escalation of the conflict with Russia. In a letter first reported by Politico on Tuesday morning, the 27 officials urged “the Biden administration, together with NATO allies, to impose a limited No-Fly Zone over Ukraine starting with protection for humanitarian corridors that were agreed upon in talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on Thursday.” “NATO leaders should convey to Russian officials that they do not seek direct confrontation with Russian forces, but they must also make clear that they will not countenance Russian attacks on civilian areas,” they added. Among those who signed the letter were William Taylor, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine; Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO; and Alexander Vershbow, former U.S. ambassador to both NATO and Russia. While a partial no-fly zone for humanitarian purposes may sound anodyne, it risks the same conclusion that caused a broader action to be rejected by top officials in the U.S. and Europe when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made the ask in the early days of the invasion: shooting down Russian planes and starting a direct war between the U.S. and a nation with an estimated 6,000 nuclear weapons. The U.S. and its allies have implemented multiple no-fly zones in recent decades over countries with much less powerful militaries, such as Bosnia and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the 1990s, as well as Libya in 2011. “President Biden and NATO Secretary General [Jens] Stoltenberg have stated that neither the United States nor NATO will engage Russian forces on the ground in Ukraine,” continued the letter. “What we seek is the deployment of American and NATO aircraft not in search of confrontation with Russia but to avert and deter Russian bombardment that would result in massive loss of Ukrainian lives.” With hundreds of civilian deaths and a refugee crisis the United Nations is calling the largest since World War II, there has been continued pressure from Ukraine for NATO to intervene. In a New York Times op-ed last week, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak called for a no-fly zone while acknowledging what it would mean. “We are calling on the West to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine,” Yermak wrote. “We recognize that this would be a serious escalation in the war and that it could bring NATO into direct conflict with Russia. But we firmly believe that Russia won’t stop at just Ukraine, which would potentially drag NATO into this conflict anyway.” “Close the sky over Ukraine! Close it for all Russian missiles, Russian combat aircraft, for all these terrorists. Make a humanitarian air zone, without rockets, without air bombs,” Zelensky said Sunday via Twitter. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a Feb. 28 briefing that implementing such a zone would require “deploying U.S. military to enforce, which would be ... potentially a direct conflict, and potentially a war with Russia, which is something we are not planning to be a part of.” She reiterated the position on Thursday. “The reason why that has not been a step the president has been willing to take or we have been interested in taking is because a no-fly zone requires implementation,” Psaki told reporters. “It would require, essentially, the U.S. military shooting down Russian planes and prompting a potential direct war with Russia, the exact step that we want to avoid.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the same on Sunday in an interview with NBC News. “The president’s been very clear about one thing all along as well, which is we’re not going to put the United States in direct conflict with Russia, not have, you know, American planes flying against Russian planes or our soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, because for everything we’re doing for Ukraine, the president also has a responsibility to not get us into a direct conflict, a direct war with Russia, a nuclear power, and risk a war that expands even beyond Ukraine to Europe,” Blinken said on “Meet the Press.” “That’s clearly not our interest. What we’re trying to do is end this war in Ukraine, not start a larger one,” he said. In Congress, two Republican legislators — Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois — have called for a no-fly zone to be implemented, while Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on Sunday that the option should be kept on the table. However, the idea has been nearly unanimously rejected, with Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., saying it would mean “World War III” and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., calling the idea “the U.S. and Russia at war. It’s a bad idea and Congress would never authorize it.” “Military equipment for Ukraine, humanitarian support for Ukraine, crippling sanction on Russia, movement of U.S. troops to the eastern flank of NATO — these are all the right moves,” he continued. “But direct war between the world’s two nuclear powers should be a non-starter.” On Friday, NATO leadership again denied Zelensky’s request. “We are not part of this conflict,” Stoltenberg said at a meeting of the alliance in Brussels. “We have a responsibility as NATO allies to prevent this war from escalating beyond Ukraine, because that would be even more dangerous, more devastating and would cause even more human suffering.” Zelensky criticized the decision in a televised address late that evening, saying, “Today there was a NATO summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe’s freedom to be the No. 1 goal. Today the leadership of the alliance gave the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages, having refused to set up a no-fly zone.”",Politics/Yahoo News,Foreign policy experts call for 'limited no-fly zone' over Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/foreign-policy-experts-call-for-limited-no-fly-zone-over-ukraine-142427349.html

3/10/2022,"(Reuters) - Moscow said on Tuesday that Ukrainian authorities had endorsed only one civilian evacuation route from areas affected by fighting out of 10 that were proposed, including five towards territory controlled by Kyiv, the Interfax news agency reported. The Russian defence ministry said 723 people had been evacuated through the Sumy-Poltava corridor, including 576 Indian nationals, in a first convoy. Ukraine said on Monday that a Russian proposal on humanitarian corridors was ""completely immoral"" after Moscow suggested it would allow people to flee Ukrainian cities towards only Belarus or Russia. Civilians have been trapped by fighting since Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, and officials say food, water and other supplies have been running low in some cities. Mikhail Mizintsev, head of the Russian National Defence Control Centre, said on Tuesday that Moscow had proposed evacuation corridors from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol - ""one from each city to the Russian Federation, as well as one each through the territories controlled by the Kyiv authorities to Poland, Moldova, Romania"". Ukrainian civilians did begin leaving the northeastern city of Sumy and the town of Irpin near Kyiv, heading towards the Ukrainian city of Poltava, but Ukraine said Russian forces had shelled another evacuation route - from the port city of Mariupol. The Russian defence ministry said earlier that Russian forces had introduced a ""silent regime"" along the evacuation corridors from 0700 GMT, Interfax reported.
