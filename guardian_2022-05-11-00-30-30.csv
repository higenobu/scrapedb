5/11/2022,"For Elsie (Woman who rides bus to stay warm is tip of pensioner poverty iceberg, 3 May), insert my friend Mary, aged in her late 80s, living in a retirement flat without care provision. She is widowed. She struggles to manage financially and her mobility is very poor: walking is now difficult and using public transport is all but impossible. She relies heavily on another friend for shopping and general help. A recent added problem is the closure of her local Lloyds bank – the nearest now being a lengthy bus journey away. She has no internet access, nor does she own a mobile phone. She is reliant on her bank, but parking in the area is difficult and Mary could not walk the distance, hence my involvement. I too am old and suffer from osteoporosis and am registered disabled, but I can drive and am able to take Mary directly to the bank, park with my blue badge and all is well. There are many Marys in this country who do not have such friends to enable them to have some quality of life. Perhaps our prime minister and his cabinet cronies should reflect on the definition of “quality of life” and give some help to the Marys and Elsies to ease their difficulties.Jenny LumleyLondon  George Eustice advises Elsie, the 77-year-old woman provided as an example of the cost of living crisis by Susanna Reid, that as well as buying supermarket own-brand products she should “seek some support from the local authority” (Britons should buy value brands to cope with living cost crisis, says minister, 4 May). Would this be one of those same local authorities cut mercilessly by the Tories over the last decade or more? It’s funny how Conservative policy is always to cut back on the state and promote private competition instead, until it dawns on them that the former might just be important. Yes, George, there’s a lot of competition to “keep those prices down”, but that competition is not compassionate, and not there to pick up the pieces when things go awry. That’s the role of the state ... it’s called government.Dr Nick PrattWestcroft, Devon  We are currently undergoing the worst cost of living crisis for more than 30 years and a substantial number of people are suffering because of it. At the same time, energy companies are making massive profits (BP profits double to $6.2bn, fuelling calls for energy windfall tax, 3 May). We are told that energy prices are going up and that the cost of fuel has to rise as a result. This increased revenue seems to be going straight into the pockets of the shareholders of energy companies such as BP and Shell. Apparently there is nothing anyone can do about the cost of living crisis other than help those who are most affected by it. Opposition parties propose that there should be a windfall tax on excessive profits to pay for this. Why can’t energy companies be forced to cut their prices to more affordable levels, which would still leave them plenty?Gordon GlassfordCorby, Northamptonshire  I was most relieved to read our prime minister’s remark, in response to the local election results, that he is going to “get us all through the economic aftershocks in the way we got through Covid”. As a disabled person living on benefits, I am now excitedly waiting for my first vaccination against poverty.Carolyn SuttonGlastonbury, Somerset  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/11/2022,"Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson’s government was “bereft of ideas or purpose” after a Queen’s speech that included bills to overhaul the planning system and rewrite human rights law, but few new measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. Warning that the UK faced a “stagflation crisis” the Labour leader said: “We need a government of the moment, with the ideas that meet the aspirations of the people.” Instead, he said there was a government that was “bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle or a roadmap for delivery”. He added: “Their time has passed.” Starmer was speaking as MPs began debating the government’s plans for the new parliamentary session, set out in a speech delivered earlier by Prince Charles, standing in for his mother. Apparently designed to win back disenchanted Tory voters, the programme includes modest planning changes that are a far cry from the radical overhaul originally envisaged, which had spooked many Conservatives. And there are a series of nods to “culture war issues”, from preventing councils pursuing political boycotts, to ensuring local people are consulted before the names of streets are changed. A new British bill of rights, promised by the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is aimed at curtailing the role of the European court of human rights (ECHR). The speech said the legislation would “ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government, strengthening freedom of speech”. The president of the Law Society, Stephanie Boyce, attacked the planned legislation, however, warning that it would undermine human rights. “If the new bill of rights becomes law, it would make it harder for all of us to protect or enforce our rights. “The proposed changes make the state less accountable. This undermines a crucial element of the rule of law, preventing people from challenging illegitimate uses of power.” The speech Prince Charles delivered began: “My government’s priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families.” But it included few new measures likely to boost the economy in the short term. Instead, the government emphasised measures it had already taken, including the temporary energy bill rebate and the cut to the universal credit taper rate. The prime minister, responding to Starmer, said the government would “continue to use all our ingenuity and passion for as long as it takes” to help families through the cost of living crisis. He dropped a heavy hint that fresh measures might be in store, saying he and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, would be “saying more about this in the days to come”. New bills will include levelling up legislation giving councils the right to sell off empty properties on local high streets and forcing the government to report regularly on whether it is meeting its levelling up “missions”. An energy security bill promises to set up “state-of-the-art business models” in hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage; while an economic crime bill will beef up Companies House, which monitors companies. And the government will legislate to permit gene-editing for crops. The Treasury will introduce a new financial services and markets bill, changing City regulation to “ensure a greater focus on growth and international competitiveness”. Rishi Sunak wants the UK to be a pioneer in new areas such as cryptocurrency, but he is likely to face questions about whether he is pursuing a Singapore-on-Thames style deregulation that could jeopardise financial stability. Two key new bills will revive long-delayed plans first proposed by Theresa May to ban “no fault” section 21 evictions for tenants, though the bill also pledges to strengthen landlords’ rights of possession, introducing new and stronger grounds for repeated incidences of rent arrears and reducing notice periods for antisocial behaviour. There will also be a social housing regulation bill designed to tackle rogue landlords. In a move to reinstate anti-protest measures thrown out by the House of Lords in January, the government will also announce new offences to stop protesters from “locking on” to infrastructure, extend stop and search powers, and make it illegal to obstruct transport projects. The public order bill will be aimed at quashing tactics employed by protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Insulate Britain and Just Stop Oil. Among other new laws will be a Brexit bill designed to make it easier to adapt carried-over EU legislation without consulting parliament – and promised legislation to tackle the widely criticised actions of P&O Ferries to undermine minimum-wage law. The law will give ports the power to refuse access to ferry services that do not pay an equivalent to the national minimum wage to seafarers while in UK waters.",News/Politics,"Queen’s speech shows Boris Johnson is out of ideas, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/boris-johnson-tries-to-woo-tory-voters-with-planning-powers-in-queens-speech
5/11/2022,"When My Chemical Romance announced their reunion tour in early 2020 – the band’s first extended spell on the road in nearly a decade – they promptly sold out three nights this month at Milton Keynes Stadium (30,000 seats) and shifted 228,000 tickets for their North American tour in less than seven hours. It’s not an unusual state of affairs: before their 2013 breakup, the US four-piece frequently headlined arenas and festivals. The difference is that back then, they were unlikely superstars, misfits who inadvertently infiltrated the mainstream – now, they return to a pop cultural landscape they helped to define. Led by vocalist Gerard Way, a talented comic artist who grew up listening to punk, metal and Britpop, they started off scrapping in New Jersey’s early 00s basement-venue hardcore circuit alongside bands such as Thursday. Their music took a darker turn on 2004’s breakthrough, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, an album influenced by the Cure’s gloomiest moments and the gothic-tinged punk fury of Misfits and the Damned. In the wake of that album’s success, My Chemical Romance (MCR) swiftly shifted gear once again. Driven by the UK No 1 hit Welcome to the Black Parade, a multi-part epic in the spirit of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, the band embraced Bowie-calibre shapeshifting, Pink Floyd’s grandeur and glam rock’s sledgehammer riffs on 2006’s The Black Parade. MCR’s final album to date, 2010’s Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was yet another departure, which drew on bratty punk, swaggering 80s rock and new wave’s colourful keyboards. To the shock of many, the group called it quits in 2013. In the years since, Way has been open about how difficult fame was for him to navigate, describing it as “extremely traumatic”, and has stressed the importance of therapy to his wellbeing. “I needed the last seven or eight years to process that experience,” he said last year. MCR also faced unique pressures on top of the toll of visibility: as the world’s highest profile emo band, they were at best frequently misunderstood, even dangerously misconstrued, and became the subject of a moral panic worthy of the days of Mary Whitehouse. Way’s emotionally vulnerable, often raw lyrics made no secret of tough times. “The triumph of the human spirit over darkness was something that was kind of built into the DNA of the band from the beginning,” Way said last year. But parts of the media scapegoated this side of the band as the cause, not a symptom, of a burgeoning youth mental health crisis. In 2008, MCR were linked in the news to 13-year-old Kent girl Hannah Bond, a fan who died by suicide. Coverage of her death zeroed in on her love of emo music; one Mail Online headline screamed “Why no child is safe from the sinister cult of emo”, while another article on the same site called MCR a “suicide cult” band. In his inquest into Bond’s death, the coroner Roger Sykes concluded: “the emo overtones concerning death and associating it with glamour I find very disturbing”. Arguably, the vilification of the genre put fans at risk. In 2007, hard rock and MCR fan Sophie Lancaster was beaten to death by a mob of strangers in Bacup, Lancashire, targeted, police said, because she was dressed in a gothic style. The following year, violence against emo fans spilled over into Mexico, where three teenagers were severely beaten in Queretaro, north of Mexico City. Speaking to NPR, journalist Ioan Grillo attributed the conflict to class differences and homophobia. “When you saw the marches, a lot of people were shouting very clearly the Mexican words or insults people use for gay,” Grillo said. The emo-blaming reaction of the media drew outrage, and spawned protests from fans as well as a firm response from the band. “We have always made it one of our missions through our actions to provide comfort, support, and solace to our fans,” they wrote at the time, while noting they were “anti-violence and anti-suicide”. They said that The Black Parade in particular had “hope and courage” as a message. “Our lyrics are about finding the strength to keep living through pain and hard times. The last song on our album states: ‘I am not afraid to keep on living’ – a sentiment that embodies the band’s position on hardships we all face as human beings.” No wreckers of civilisation, MCR spoke directly to the feelings of depression and alienation experienced by vast numbers of young people. Their endurance in the face of smear campaigns speaks to how urgently they understood their fans. And despite their melodramatic stylings, the band weren’t schlock merchants: they originally emerged as the horrified emotional response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. “This broken city sky / Like butane on my skin,” Way sings in the early song Skylines and Turnstiles. From these origins, MCR made mortality and radical honesty about uncomfortable topics part of their DNA. The first track on Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, Helena, references Gerard and his brother Mikey Way’s late grandmother amid a backdrop of guilt and self-recrimination, while I’m Not Okay (I Promise) is marked by a crumbling facade of bravado: their idea of punk rebellion was to admit that your brave front is actually a mirage. The Black Parade is a concept album about someone dying from cancer, and reminiscing about their life in flashbacks. Although serious, the album has moments of levity – as in Teenagers, a very apt song spoofing the way adults fear adolescents – that speak to the ups and downs of grief. Meanwhile, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys confronts capitalism and oppression. Musically, too, the band were more complex than the “emo” tag suggested: MCR were classicists putting a contemporary spin on influences such as Queen, Alice Cooper, Bowie and Smashing Pumpkins. They also made explicit those acts’ flirtations with gender boundaries. Way drew on the early 80s looks of Duran Duran, the vampiric pallor of the Damned’s Dave Vanian and the androgyny of Placebo’s Brian Molko. He often sported severe black raccoon eyes or myxomatosis-red shadow, a platinum crop conjuring shades of 70s Lou Reed, or a cartoonish shock of tomato-red hair. Around the time of The Black Parade, the band members dressed in black marching band uniforms that were formal and stern, yet camp, too. For Way, these theatrical gestures were a way to expand the limits of his identity. “I have always identified a fair amount with the female gender, and began at a certain point in MCR to express this through my look and performance style,” he said. He namechecked figures such as Freddie Mercury, Bowie, Iggy Pop and T-Rex, adding: “Masculinity to me has always made me feel like it wasn’t right for me.” Flaunting heteronormative stereotypes was yet another thing that made MCR an easy target for harassment. Once again, they used this unenviable position to advocate for those at the sharp end of such prejudice. On a tour supporting his 2014 solo album, Hesitant Alien, Way expressed his support for trans and non-binary people during onstage speeches. “I identify with trans people and women a lot because I was a girl to a lot of people growing up,” he later told Boy Zine. Expressing his femininity through MCR gave him hope, he said. “I want to make sure women and men and everyone in between feel safe and empowered.” In 2015, guitarist Ray Toro dedicated his solo song For the Lost and Brave to Leelah Alcorn, a 15-year-old transgender teen from the US who died by suicide and left behind a wrenching note. “Yet another young life gone because of not being heard, not being understood, and not being unconditionally loved for who they truly were,” Toro wrote on his website. During the band’s absence, their stature and impact grew significantly – not least because popular culture caught up to their ethos of emotional vulnerability and boundary-breaking self-expression. Today, MCR are returning to a world where being emo is so mainstream that rapper Machine Gun Kelly released a song called Emo Girl and collaborated with Bring Me the Horizon, while Grammy-winning sensation Olivia Rodrigo is channelling Paramore and collaborating with Dan Nigro, vocalist-guitarist for 00s indie-emo band As Tall as Lions. All of this may be a passing fad – but the alternative rock realm MCR left behind has expanded in their image: it’s a place where greater honesty, empathy and a willingness to understand mental health difficulties are flourishing, and in which boundaries of gender and genre are dissolving. The late rappers Lil Peep and Juice Wrld continue to have large followings thanks to their deeply vulnerable, personal lyrics. After two years plus of the pandemic, a crop of songwriters known for talking frankly about mental health – such as Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, Lucy Dacus, Soccer Mommy and Japanese Breakfast – have elevated profiles. Today, MCR’s legacy is arguably comparable to that of Nirvana, another group of scrappy underdogs who proudly identified with the outcasts. Both bands drew on underground punk influences for inspiration and spoke to the marginalised; both became cultural forces by accident. Like Kurt Cobain, Way is an outspoken feminist (and fan of riot grrrl). These parallels weren’t lost on him. “I found myself in a position where I was obviously not nearly at the level that Kurt was, but I was speaking to a young generation of people,” he told GQ last year. “It doesn’t mean you have to play the fame game or the red carpet game or anything like that … Nirvana inspired us to reject those things.” Declining celebrity and refusing to back down in the face of mass-media vilification allowed MCR to establish their own powerful stance, which resonated loudly with admirers who also existed outside what was considered marketable and acceptable by the mainstream. Not only has the world got kinder to the “emo teens” of the worid in the years since the band split, but being an outsider has also become highly sought after as a marker of cultural cachet.

5/11/2022,"It’s good that universities oppose limits to education (Universities oppose plan for student cap and loans in England, 9 May). But when it comes to adult education and lifelong learning, the problem is not just limits on loan access – it’s debt itself. The disastrous collapse in part-time education in Britain caused by the coalition government’s tripling of university fees was due to its denial that getting into debt in later life is different from making a life choice of whether to go to university aged 18. For adult learners, it may be a choice between taking a loan to study or having a family holiday that year. Research published in Wonkhe this week confirms support for lifelong learning, but not for forcing adult learners deeper into debt. As the Universities Association for Lifelong Learning said in its response to the government’s consultation, the entitlement should be to lifelong learning, not to getting into debt.

5/11/2022,"The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, has said if Keir Starmer were to resign over an alleged breach of lockdown rules it does not automatically mean the prime minister should do the same. In a statement on Monday, the Labour leader said he would do the “right thing” if he was issued with a fixed-penalty notice in relation to a gathering in Labour offices in Durham in April last year. The move has been viewed as a huge gamble, with Starmer placing his future in the hands of Durham police after it was announced last week officers would reopen an investigation into the event at which he drank beer and ate a takeaway curry. However, Labour sources have said they are confident they can prove it was a work event and that those present were taking a break to eat while working late on preparations for the Hartlepool byelection. The Guardian revealed Labour has compiled time-stamped logs of WhatsApp chats, documents and video edits – which it will provide to Durham police for their investigation. Asked on LBC if Johnson should follow suit if the Labour leader was issued with a penalty and does resign, Malthouse, a longtime ally of Boris Johnson, said: “Not necessarily, no.” He told LBC: “Obviously in any situation where, you know, the rules were moving around, there were misunderstandings or mistakes were made, and apologies are made and they are accepted, then people of all walks of life should be able to keep their jobs. But Keir Starmer has to speak for himself and set his own standards.” Johnson’s spokesperson later echoed this view, saying the prime minister did not see the need to follow Starmer’s example over resignation if found to have breached Covid laws. “The prime minister’s position hasn’t changed,” he said. “Obviously, he came to the house and took responsibility and offered a full, unreserved apology for the mistakes made.” The spokesperson added: “I’m not going to get drawn into what other individuals should do.” Starmer’s critics have suggested he is attempting to put pressure on Durham police as the force would not want to be seen as in effect ending his tenure as Labour leader. Malthouse told Sky News the police force would meet “high standards” regardless of any alleged pressure. “Durham police will operate professionally to the high standards we expect of them irrespective of what the external goings-on are around this case,” he said. “We need to leave them the space and time to do their job.” Ken Macdonald – a former director of public prosecutions like Starmer – has said the suggestion Durham police would be pressured in their investigation was “wide of the mark”. The crossbench peer told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “My experience of working with the police in very sensitive cases under full glare of public and press interest was that, very quickly, you find your focus taking over and, in a sense, a sort of bloody-mindedness creeps in: ‘This is my case and I’ll decide it, thank you very much, without any help from you.’” In his statement on Monday, Starmer said repeatedly no rules had been broken as he sought to contrast his actions with those of Johnson, who has refused to quit after being issued with a fixed-penalty notice by the Metropolitan police over a gathering in No 10 in June 2020 to mark his 56th birthday. But having called for Johnson to go for breaking the law, many at Westminster believe Starmer will have no choice but to fall on his sword if found to have done so himself. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, who was also present at the Durham event, has said she too will stand down if she is issued with a penalty notice.",News/Politics,"PM should not have to copy any Starmer resignation, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/boris-johnson-should-not-have-to-copy-any-keir-starmer-resignation-says-minister
5/11/2022,"The government’s proposed ban on conversion practices intended to change people’s sexuality will in fact only fully cover under-18s, Downing Street has confirmed, saying it had to “strike the right balance” on outlawing the much-condemned practice. In an apparent change of plan which prompted immediate condemnation from equalities groups, No 10 said that adults in England and Wales who consented to sexuality conversion for religious or personal reasons would be allowed to do so. This is expected to be permitted only if “this does not cause serious harm”, officials said, with full details to be set out in the promised conversion therapy bill. The bill has already been watered down – originally it was planned also to outlaw similar practices intended to change someone’s approach to their gender identity. That was dropped, to the consternation of equalities groups and some MPs. The government document outlining the Queen’s speech said the law, targeted at “abhorrent conversion therapy practices”, would “protect under-18s, regardless of circumstance, and over-18s who do not consent and who are coerced or forced to undergo conversion therapy practices”. Asked whether this meant adults could undertake such practices with consent, Boris Johnsons’s official spokesperson said: “That’s the understanding. Obviously, we’ll set out the full details when we publish the bill.” Asked why this was the case when Johnson had described the process as “abhorrent”, the spokesperson said: “Obviously, this is a difficult area. We need to strike the right balance, but I think it’s important to wait for the full details of the bill to be set out.” He added: “It is obviously abhorrent to force this on anyone. But it is a complex area that needs careful management.” Jayne Ozanne, a campaigner and former government adviser on LGBTQ+ issues, tweeted: “Whilst I’m naturally relieved to see that the government are still committed to banning “conversion therapy”, it is of great concern that they are creating so many loopholes and leaving so many people unprotected. “The government’s own research shows that trans people are twice as likely to be offered ‘conversion therapy’ and it is an utter disgrace that they have purposefully omitted them from the ban.” The Ban Conversion Therapy coalition said there were “two giant loopholes” to the law, both in terms of consent, and the lack of provision for transgender issues. The briefing document for the Queen’s speech said the planned law would introduce a criminal offence “banning non-physical conversion therapies to complement existing legislation which protects people from acts which inflict physical harm”, with other safeguards such as potentially removing passports from those at risk of being taken overseas. The law would ensure “parents, clinicians and teachers can continue to have conversations with people seeking support”, the guidance said, adding: “Robust, exploratory and challenging conversations which are part of regulated care do not fall within the scope of the ban.”",News/Society,"Bill banning conversion practices will only fully cover under-18s, No 10 says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/bill-banning-conversion-practices-england-wales-under-18s
5/11/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night TV after a week off with Covid – the host tested positive last Monday and “by Friday the virus took a look around my body and said yuck, we’re getting out of here,” he quipped on Monday evening. “I drank so much bleach my teeth are whiter than a fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago,” he joked. After thanking Mike Birbiglia for helming the show last-minute in his absence, Kimmel turned to yet another former Trump official on a tell-all book tour. Mark Esper, Trump’s former defense secretary, appeared on 60 Minutes this weekend to share what Kimmel called an “almost impossible-to-believe anecdote about Trump’s plan to handle Americans protesting outside the White House after the killing of George Floyd”. Esper said Trump wondered aloud “can’t you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?” and that the president suggested bringing in troops to shoot the protesters. “Well, in fairness, he said the same thing about Eric,” Kimmel deadpanned. In response to Esper’s interview, Trump told 60 Minutes: “This is a complete lie, and 10 witnesses can back it up … Mark Esper was weak and totally ineffective, and because of it, I had to run the military.” “Right, Captain Bone Spurs had to run the military for Mark Esper,” Kimmel laughed. “And we know that’s a lie because unlike everything else he ran, the military didn’t go bankrupt on his watch. “It’s really almost unfathomable that this imbecile was running our country,” he added. On Late Night, Seth Meyers mocked Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former personal lawyer, for backing out of an interview with the House January 6 committee at the last minute because he wanted to record it himself. “Why does he want to record the interview?” Meyers wondered. “Is he worried they’re going cut it together to make it sound bad? That’s what his brain already does to his mouth. “Why do guys like Rudy always have some weird angle? Like thinking they’re some genius chess master calling their bluff by asking to record the meeting,” he continued. “But anytime Rudy has ever been recorded, it’s been bad for him.” Giuliani, for instance, has been recorded calling a senator on the day of the insurrection to overturn the election results, and butt-dialing a reporter while discussing his need for cash. “Rudy records himself saying incriminating things all the time,” Meyers said. “Before he talks to anyone, he should pat himself down to make sure he’s not wearing a wire.” To explain his decision, Giuliani went on Steve Bannon’s podcast and “did not do himself any favors”, according to Meyers. To quote the former mayor of New York and election conspiracy theorist: “You got a bunch of people on that committee that tried to frame the sitting president of the United States, and I’m going to trust them? Do I look like a fool?” “Do you look like a fool …” Meyers laughed. “Well …” he said over a slideshow of pictures of Giuliani looking ridiculous – with hair dye dripping down his face, unzipping his pants in 2020’s Borat Subsequent Moviefilm, or appearing on The Masked Singer. In light of Giuliani’s refusal to participate, the House committee has threatened to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress. “Hey committee, I don’t know how any of this works, but can you stop waiting until people don’t show up before you start considering what their punishment will be?” Meyers said. “Why can’t you just say, before they don’t show up, either be here at the appointed time or you’re going to jail.”",Arts/Culture,Jimmy Kimmel on latest Trump tell-all: ‘Almost unfathomable that this imbecile was running our country’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/10/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump-seth-myers
5/11/2022,"Burgeoning goal god Erling Haaland has agreed a move to Manchester City from Borussia Dortmund. “Everyone in this country supports Liverpool, the media and everyone,” sobbed Pep Guardiola at the weekend. He was, of course, incorrect. What everyone, in fact, supports is beef between football managers. The vast majority have only a passing interest in the success or otherwise of the best teams in the country – the general sentiment being that if your team can’t win something then it’s better if no one does – but when it comes to minor spats between coaches … well, inject it into our veins. Disappointingly, Jürgen Klopp refused to bite on Guardiola’s tirade, providing an infuriatingly sensible and understanding answer when prompted on the topic. “Imagine how the situation would be if we were not that close,” he sighed. “Then the interviews would be boring. You have to make sure there is some excitement and there is an exciting battle for who stays in the league and an exciting battle for who qualifies for [Big Cup]. But imagine if we were not closer.

And he’s a Liverpool legend to boot! What a way to end? “The way the fixtures have fallen we can have a say in the title race – that is how it is,” he yawned. “We will try to win all of the games that are in front of us.” Ah. Well, OK. But have you played out in your head the deliciously thrilling/heart-wrenching/beef-creating scenario of possibly derailing Liverpool’s bid for the title? “Not really, no.” Gah! “Preparation is always about Aston Villa and preparing my team in the best way we can,” he added, doubling down on this irritating outbreak of reasonableness. “Whoever I represent, I’ll go into the game wanting to win.” Hmph.

5/11/2022,"Museums still tend to celebrate the Mr Bigs in society: their stately homes and vanity portraits, their inventions and ideas. But on the banks of the River Irwell, opposite Manchester’s high court, sits a curvaceous modern building dedicated to the often ordinary men and women who have fought for Britain’s rights and freedoms. Cloaked in the same weathered steel as the Angel of the North, the People’s History Museum transmits the same warm welcome as Antony Gormley’s winged monolith, but with an excellent gift shop and lovely cafe selling mostly vegan and vegetarian fare. Its aim is to inspire the next generation of “active citizens” via its 60,000-strong collection, which includes the world’s oldest trade union banner, a pike used in self-defence by a protester at the Peterloo massacre in 1819, and a board game used as a propaganda tool for the suffragettes. More recent acquisitions include Andy Burnham’s navy workers’ jacket, which spawned a mini industry in think-pieces after he wore it to berate the government over the Covid tiering system in 2020; an empty can of BrewDog Barnard Castle Eye Test beer, which marked Dominic Cummings’ infamous lockdown dash to the north-east; and a knitted Black Lives Matter bannerette. One of just two national museums based in Manchester (the other is – of course – dedicated to football), the PHM also calls itself “Britain’s national museum of democracy”. It transports visitors from the 1700s to the present and beyond, exploring not just the freedoms we enjoy today but also the many causes that still need fighting for. It is one of five institutions in the running for the £100,000 Art Fund museum of the year prize, alongside the Museum of Making (Derby); the Horniman Museum and Gardens (London); The Story Museum (Oxford); and Tŷ Pawb (Wrexham), a museum in a north Wales market with makers, traders and galleries all under one roof. Burnham’s jacket, donated by the mayor of Greater Manchester at the museum’s behest, is not yet on show. But current visitors can admire another famous coat, worn by Labour leader Michael Foot at the Cenotaph for the 1981 Remembrance Sunday service. Derided by the rightwing press as a “donkey jacket” more suitable for a building site than a site of national mourning, the dark brown tweedy number was in fact bought by Foot’s wife from Harrods especially for the occasion. But the press – then, as now, largely owned by wealthy supporters of the Conservative party – portrayed it as deliberate disrespect for the nation’s war dead from the pacifist Foot. Visitors are invited to conclude that Donald Trump did not invent the concept of “fake news”. Also in the collection is the red anorak worn in Coronation Street by the UK’s first transgender soap character, Hayley Cropper, played by Julie Hesmondhalgh from 1998 to 2014. The coat came to PHM as part of the 2017 exhibition Never Going Underground: The Fight for LGBT+ Rights, which marked the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of homosexual acts in England and Wales. But the jewel of PHM’s collection is undoubtedly the political banners, which include that oldest surviving trade union banner, made to support the Tin Plate Workers Society in 1821. The PHM began life in 1975 as the National Museum of Labour History, showcasing a collection of historical campaign materials about the rights of working people, hoarded by the Trade Union Labour and Co-operative History Society. Opened by then prime minister Harold Wilson in Limehouse Town Hall in London, the collection’s showpiece was Thomas Paine’s tiny writing desk. Still on display at the PHM today, it’s where the political activist wrote Rights of Man (1791), arguing that all men over the age of 21 should receive the vote. A funding crisis prompted a move north in 1988, when the museum was rescued by Greater Manchester councils and the Trades Union Congress (TUC). As home to both the suffragette movement and the Peterloo massacre, Manchester seemed a fitting new HQ for a collection celebrating the political struggles of working-class people. It got its new name in 2002, ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, as it began to focus more on cultural diversity and inclusion. The museum’s archives are a treasure trove for fans of political minutiae. As well as housing the archives of both the Labour party and the Communist party of Great Britain, there is a comprehensive library of election leaflets, and all sorts of intriguing box files. A researcher from Taiwan recently spent a week there researching scouting in China; another was only interested in Indian women coal miners in the 1920s and 1930s. Though the museum charts the history of all the main political parties and has held at least one exhibition dedicated to the Conservative party, it is inextricably linked with the Labour movement. That has not always been helpful when applying to Conservative governments for funding: in 2014 it faced a grant cut of up to £200,000. Many people thought the move was politically motivated. Len McCluskey, then general secretary of Unite the Union, called it “a blatant attempt by the Tory party to rewrite history in its own image, to stop future generations from learning what their great-grandfathers sacrificed in the name of their country”. The museum does not shy away from criticising the government. Last month it issued a statement saying it was “deeply saddened” to hear that the government was continuing with its plans to pass the nationality and borders bill through parliament, which it said “threatens refugees and stands as a barrier to those fleeing war and persecution”. In September, Katy Ashton, the PHM’s director since 2010, criticised the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which could see protests deemed to be too noisy or causing “serious annoyance” shut down. “Most worrying to a democratic society,” she wrote, “is the potential for arrest that it makes possible, which is likely to silence those in the community that are already marginalised, or those who already struggle to have their voices heard.” In their citation for the museum of the year shortlist, the judges seem to approve. “In the context of national conversations about migration, People’s History Museum has shifted from a museum about campaigning to a museum that campaigns,” they write. The judges also admired how the museum co-creates its programmes in partnership with communities. Last year, its More in Common project explored the life and legacy of Jo Cox MP, working with a wide variety of people living in Manchester. And the museum continues to explore the theme of migration with those who have experienced it first-hand. “Of course I’m biased,” says Ashton, “but I think there’s something really special and emotive about the type of work that we do and so much that is relevant and has resonance. The museum of the year nomination feels like a testimony to the work that the team do. And it feels like it’s the right time for us to say, actually, museums don’t have to shy away from difficult issues and complicated subjects.”",Arts/Culture,From Michael Foot’s ‘donkey jacket’ to Barnard Castle beer … inside the People’s History Museum,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/10/inside-peoples-history-museum-manchester
5/11/2022,"Peloton’s share price crashed 20% in early trading after the exercise bike maker missed revenue targets, cut sales guidance and reported a bigger quarterly loss than anticipated, and its boss described turning the company around as “emotionally draining”. Peloton, whose market value has fallen by more than 80% over the last year, reported revenues of $964m (£780m), down from $1.26bn in the same quarter last year, as the pandemic-enforced trend for home workouts that fuelled a surge in sales of its hi-tech, internet-connected exercise bikes peters out. The company, which missed analyst revenue estimates by about $6m in its fiscal third quarter to the end of March, reported a loss of $757m. “Turnarounds are hard work,” the chief executive, Barry McCarthy, who took over from the co-founder John Foley in February, said in a letter to shareholders. “It’s intellectually challenging, emotionally draining, physically exhausting, and all-consuming. It’s a full-contact sport.” In January, Peloton said in a message to its 3,200 staff that it needed to “evaluate” its workforce, subsequently cutting thousands of jobs, and indicated it needed to implement production curbs because of a slump in demand. “The balance sheet challenge has been managing inventory,” said McCarthy, a former chief financial officer at Spotify and Netflix. “We have too much for the current run rate of the business, and that inventory has consumed an enormous amount of cash, more than we expected, which has caused us to rethink our capital structure. Fortunately the obsolescence risk on this is negligible, and we believe the inventory will sell eventually. So this is primarily a cashflow timing issue, not a structural issue.” Peloton said it expected to report revenues of $675m to $700m in its fourth quarter, well below analysts’ average estimate of $820.9m. The company said this was due to “softer demand” compared with its previous guidance, and recent hardware price reductions. Peloton said the number of members grew 5% quarter-on-quarter to 7 million, with the number of workouts during the quarter growing by almost a third to 184.3m. The company, which is implementing a price increase to its monthly subscription fee from 1 June, said it had only experienced a “modest” customer churn rate so far this year. It said it had signed a deal with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to borrow $750m in five-year term debt. Peloton has said it is not seeking a sale, but reports suggested the company may look to sell a stake of as much as 20% of the business to an outside investor to accelerate its turnaround strategy.",News/Business,Peloton shares plunge 20% as losses widen and sales guidance cut,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/peloton-share-price-losses-sales-cut
5/11/2022,"Manchester City have confirmed a deal to sign Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund this summer. The striker’s buyout clause, understood to be about €60m (£51.5m), has been met and the Norway international will earn a salary of about £350,000 a week, plus bonuses. Haaland passed a medical this week and the deal ends Pep Guardiola’s search for a long-term successor to City’s record goalscorer, Sergio Agüero. Haaland, who will be 22 in July, has scored 85 goals in 88 appearances for Dortmund, whom he joined from RB Salzburg in January 2020. City said: “Manchester City can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle with Borussia Dortmund for the transfer of striker Erling Haaland to the club on 1st July 2022. The transfer remains subject to the club finalising terms with the player.” Guardiola had earlier cautioned against the idea that Haaland will solve all City’s goalscoring needs. “The new players always help to try to be a stronger team but a good defender will not solve our defensive problems, one striker will not solve scoring problems that maybe we have,” the manager said. “Not me, the club has to have a vision for the future.

5/11/2022,"Alist of pronouns for each cast and creative member in this production arrives before opening night. It tells us that Taylor McClaine, the actor playing the show’s titular character, uses they/them, which feels apt for an adaptation of a story about gender fluidity from 1928. Orlando reminds us that the idea of multiple selves is not a modern invention. Virginia Woolf’s hero who turns into a heroine during the story is also a time traveller. Woolf’s thrilling fantasy of liberation from time and gender constraints begins in the Elizabethan age and ends in the 20th century, Orlando voyaging through it rakishly, having affairs and heartbreaks along the way. McClaine turns out to be perfect casting: arch, fresh-faced and puckish with a flame of red hair. This is a dinky version of the story that ekes out every last delicious drop of wit from Woolf’s text, as well as the voluptuous beauty of her language. It is an incredibly faithful adaptation by Sarah Ruhl, a feat in itself given the production lasts only 90 minutes. Stella Powell-Jones’s intelligent direction gives the show a self-conscious sense of story-building. The book’s biographical voice is turned into joint narration between the five cast members, who double up in roles and include Tigger Blaize, Skye Hallam, Rosalind Lailey and Stanton Wright. Each is as sharp and mischievous as the next. Initially it has the spirit of a parlour game but who can begrudge that when it is so smartly and slickly done? The drama becomes better as it loses the slightly starchy archness and builds on its joyful humour, which is sometimes delightfully physical. Ceci Calf’s set design creates an almost childlike spirit of make-believe; there is a miniature version of a stage on the set, naively painted, with curtains swinging open and sound effects made by the cast at times (Roly Botha’s sound design on the whole is excellent). Ali Hunter’s lighting design showers it with yet more magic and Emily Stuart’s costume design is profound. Orlando appears in Elizabethan ruff and knee-breeches at the start but then puts on period frocks and trousers. Despite their playfulness, the onstage costume changes underline not only the passing of time but also how feminine or masculine dress defines us. As Orlando says, it is the clothes that wear us and not the other way around. Femininity and masculinity themselves are, in this world, as slippery, unfixed and multiple as the clothes that are slipped on and off. “Who am I?” Orlando says towards the end, and then realises, ecstatically, that there is no single “I”. Orlando is at Jermyn Street theatre, London, until 28 May.",Arts/Stage,Orlando review – make a date for Virginia Woolf’s puckish time traveller,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/10/orlando-review-virginia-woolf
5/11/2022,"France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a phone call with Orbán in an effort to break the deadlock over the latest round of EU sanctions, the sixth since the eve of the invasion. There were “contacts at all levels to ensure we have a global deal on this sixth package”, a spokesperson at the Élysée Palace said after the call. Clément Beaune, a Macron ally and France’s Europe minister, said he thought “we could strike a deal this week”. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen said there had been progress after making a last-minute dash to Budapest to discuss the plans with Orbán on Monday night. The European Commission president described the discussion as “helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security”. “We made progress, but further work is needed,” she added, promising to hold a video conference with other countries in the region to boost cooperation on oil infrastructure. EU diplomats insist all 27 member states are united behind the idea of a ban on Russian oil, with sources close to the talks describing the delay as technical rather than political. However, the EU had hoped to announce the oil embargo and a new set of sanctions on influential Russians before last weekend, following Von der Leyen’s presentation of the plans at the European parliament last Wednesday. About a quarter of the EU’s oil comes from Russia, but some countries use far more. Slovakia and Hungary, landlocked countries that are nearly 100%-dependent on Russian oil, have been offered a delay in imposing the oil embargo until the end of 2024, to enable them to overhaul their refineries. The Czech Republic has been offered a delay until June 2024, while the full ban would come into force for the rest of the EU by the end of this year. Orbán said last week that “in its present form” the proposal was “tantamount to dropping a nuclear bomb on the Hungarian economy”. The Hungarian foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, repeated the phrase before Monday’s talks with Von der Leyen, according to Orbán’s international spokesperson, Zoltán Kovács. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Százhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can only take Russian oil. Hungarian officials say they could get oil from Croatia, but this would require their southern neighbour to boost its capacity. A European Commission spokesperson said on Tuesday that Von der Leyen had been invited by Orbán to discuss “issues related to European energy security and supply” and had gone to Budapest “to listen and to search for solutions jointly”. The discussion did not go into timelines on phasing out Russian oil in Hungary, the spokesperson said, but focused on oil transportation infrastructure. Orbán has also threatened to block attempts to sanction Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, who has described the attack on Ukraine as a “religious cleansing operation”. Speaking on Hungarian radio last week, Orbán said the Orthodox community in Hungary had written to him protesting about the cleric’s inclusion on a draft list that would mean a travel ban and asset freezes in the EU. Orbán said he opposed imposing sanctions on church leaders “because that would affect the religious freedom of communities in Hungary, which is sacrosanct”.",News/World news,Hopes for EU ban on Russian oil despite Hungary comparing plan to ‘nuclear bomb’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/hopes-raised-for-eu-oil-ban-on-russia-despite-hungary-comparing-plan-to-nuclear-bomb
5/11/2022,"A Queen’s speech without a queen; two future kings and a queen consort in waiting; the state opening of parliament was the most public and formal manifestation yet of “Operation Transition”, which has been quietly going on inside Buckingham Palace for several years. For the first time in two centuries, an heir to the throne read aloud the words compiled by the government at this most ceremonial of spectacles. The crucial difference between George IV, standing in for his mentally incapacitated father George III , and Prince Charles, seated not on the sovereign’s throne but on the consort’s throne once used by his father Prince Philip, is that the latter is not a formal regent. Charles, in Admiral of the Fleet uniform rather than the robes of state, the imperial state crown representative of sovereign placed on a table in front of where the Queen’s throne would have been, was there as a counsellor of state. Flanked by the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke of Cambridge, he was instructed by his mother through Letters Patent, to perform this role and for this day only. The Queen, meanwhile, was understood to be watching on TV from Windsor Castle. But we do not, according to the constitutional expert Prof Vernon Bogdanor, have a “de facto regency”. “A regency requires three out of five dignitaries, the Prince of Wales, the lord chancellor, the Speaker of the Commons, the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls, to certify that the Queen is permanently – permanently – incapable of carrying out her duties. That judgment would no doubt be made on doctor’s advice. There is no evidence that this is the case,” said Bogdanor, professor of government at King’s College, London and author of The Monarchy and the Constitution. “The criterion is objective. The Queen cannot simply say: ‘I cannot carry out my duties.’ A voluntary decision she could in theory take is abdication.” But this, he said, was unlikely given her pledge to the nation in 1947. Said by Buckingham Palace to experience “episodic mobility issues”, the Queen has cancelled many engagements over several months. With such uncertainty surrounding her physical capabilities, decisions are now being made on a day-to-day basis. The Letters Patent, issued under section 6(1) of the Regency Act 1937, are a useful instrument in such circumstances, allowing her to entrust counsellors of state to deputise as and when. “The counsellors of state, unlike the regent, have no decision-making powers; in particular they cannot act on any matter on which the sovereign has the right to question government policy or to make suggestions about it. This is symbolised by the fact they can never act singly,” said Bogdanor. There are currently four: Charles, William, Harry and Andrew. The latter two are clearly problematic at present. And there are certain core constitutional functions that, unless there is a regency, cannot be delegated; such as giving royal assent to legislation, appointing a prime minister, the weekly meeting with the PM and appointing and dismissing governor generals. The presence of William, attending his first state opening also as a counsellor of state, and Camilla, will be seen as by Buckingham Palace as demonstrating the crown is in safe hands as the Queen progressively withdraws from public life. “She is very much in charge. Charles is deputising for her as he has done before,” said royal historian and author Robert Lacey. “We are very far from regency. That implies a surrender of authority, which just isn’t in her nature. She was born and grew up at the knee of the founder of the house of Windsor. She saw this system being created and she understood it instinctively when she called George V ‘Grandpa England’”. William’s presence was “significant”, Lacey said, in demonstrating continuity. The Sussexes’ decision to decamp to the US had resulted in Charles and William becoming closer than ever, he said. The Covid pandemic, too, may have made this transition easier. The Queen, who once said she has to be seen to be believed, may be spending most of her time at Windsor Castle, but has mastered the video technology to ensure she is still seen carrying out virtual engagements. “So two possible disasters, the split between the brothers and the pandemic, actually work to the advantage of the new system in the future, bringing Charles and William together more as a team and giving the Queen a way to be seen that didn’t exist before,” Lacey added. On the two previous occasions the Queen has missed state openings,in 1959 and 1963 due to pregnancy, the lord chancellor had read the government-drafted speech, as was the case when Queen Victoria did not attend. If that had been the case today, it would have meant Dominic Raab performing the duty. But the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 altered the role of lord chancellor, downgrading it from a position incorporating the role of Lord Speaker. “The current lord chancellor is in the Commons. An alternative might have been the Lord Speaker of the Lords, Lord McFall. But the Prince of Wales gives the right degree of symbolism and pageantry to the occasion in my view,” said Bogdanor. “Today was a constitutional innovation. But any solution would have been a constitutional innovation.”",News/Politics,Queen remains ‘very much in charge’ even as Charles makes speech,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/queen-remains-very-much-in-charge-even-as-charles-makes-speech
5/11/2022,"Fur Clemt, meaning “very hungry” in Wigan dialect, is a much-loved community supermarket which sells unsold or overproduced food at a heavily discounted price to local people struggling with their household budgets. Since December, its owner, Shirley Southworth, has observed a shift: “We’ve seen membership soar and become more varied … It’s not just people on benefits, it’s those who are just about managing, people trying to keep their head above water.” What’s changed is the cost of living crisis, which has resulted in household spending rising most for those on the lowest incomes, who have the smallest margins and are unable to cut down on luxuries. This is not just the 20% of households living in poverty in Pemberton, where Fur Clemt is based, but also many families who are better-off.For Southworth, the volunteer-run organisation is about local people taking control. “It’s about doing something for yourself and not having it done by you … Wigan is a Labour-run council and they’re really supportive, but I’m not sure with central government there’s much connection between what’s going on on the ground and what they perceive.”Her scepticism is reflected in new polling of 2,164 people, which showed that just 14% trusted the government to solve the cost of living crisis, according to New Local, a thinktank that represents councils and advocates for community-run services. More than two-thirds (68%) argued that more power should be given to local communities to tackle the issue themselves, and nearly four-fifths (79%) said Westminster and Whitehall were making decisions “about people and places they know little about”. This may help explain Conservative losses in the local elections, which have been interpreted as punishment from voters dissatisfied with the prime minister’s perceived failure to tackle the impact of soaring inflation – expected to reach 10% this year – and the biggest annual decline in living standards since records began in 1956. Fur Clemt is one of a growing number of community-led organisations which, exasperated with a lack of government support to tackle the cost of living crisis, are taking matters into their own hands. Other organisations include the Ambition Lawrence Weston charity, based in a deprived housing estate in Bristol, which raised £4m to build the tallest wind turbine in England. The revenue it generates will be spent on community projects, while the energy it produces will alleviate fuel poverty for local families.These projects especially benefit people who would not have expected to need extra support prior to the cost of living crisis, such as working families. Fur Clemt’s model removed the stigma associated with food banks, said Southworth, by marketing itself as an environmental project aimed at reducing food waste and allowing people to buy the food they wanted.“One lady comes in twice a week and said she took her children to Legoland on the savings she had made, and she wouldn’t have been able to afford to do that otherwise. It gives families the opportunity to make savings. It might be to buy electricity or gas, but it might also be to treat the kids to something,” she added. Southworth works with Wigan council and community groups to reach the most vulnerable, including domestic violence survivors and homeless people. She also runs cooking classes on how to use the food in stock, and is negotiating fuel vouchers with an energy company to offset soaring gas and electricity costs. To enable more organisations to emulate Fur Clemt, New Local is calling for the government to introduce a community power act, which would devolve power to councils and local people to give them a greater say over public spaces, services and local investment. The thinktank says this differs from David Cameron’s much-derided “big society” because the state would adequately resource communities and voluntary organisations, for instance by giving them 25% of the levelling up budget, which at present prioritises large-scale infrastructure projects. The New Local chief executive, Adam Lent, said: “Rather than struggle for half-baked, top-down solutions, the government should trust and resource communities to tackle the issues that are affecting them directly at a local level. That would really be giving back control.” A government spokesperson said this was under way through London-style devolution deals, which aimed to put “power into the hands of those who know their communities best” by 2030. He added that the government was boosting councils with extra funding, while changes to universal credit and direct support for bills would help working families. For projects such as Fur Clemt, extra funding could not come soon enough, Southworth said. “Funding always helps because we can pass that on in various ways to the community. Our costs are rising as well. We have to collect our food, and the van and fuel costs are going up. It’s an expensive project to run and it’s getting more expensive, especially with the price of gas and electricity going up.”",News/Society,Taking back control: the local projects stepping up in the cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/taking-back-control-the-local-projects-stepping-up-in-the-cost-of-living-crisis
5/11/2022,"There’s a sweet moment in this mostly music documentary about rock star Nick Cave, in which he talks about having always defined himself in the past as a musician or a performer, but now he thinks of himself increasingly as a father or a husband. He even jokes that recently he took the government’s advice to retrain during the pandemic and became a ceramicist, specialising in mock-Meissen figurines showing the devil at various stages of a melancholy life, several of which enigmatically involved sailors. As the soliloquy says, one man in his time plays many parts, and in Cave’s case one of those roles could be described as semi-professional documentary subject, as there have already been quite a few films about him – most notably Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard’s inventive 2014 portrait 20,000 Days on Earth. Just two years later, The Assassination of Jesse James director Andrew Dominik made another film about Cave, One More Time With Feeling, observing him at an incredibly painful time soon after the death of one of his sons, a tragedy barely mentioned but deeply felt both in that latter film and in this, a sort-of sequel, made before the death of another son, Jethro Lazenby. At that point, Cave seemed to have healed at least a little, finding comfort not just in music and making, but also in listening to others’ pain. We see him reading messages left by fans, posts where they share their own losses and challenges, and he responds with encouragement and warmth, like the priest in a virtual church dedicated to himself, but with a strong pastoral element all the same. Elsewhere the film engages with Cave and Warren Ellis’ creative bond, one that’s produced some sublime work but also self-indulgent noodling (of which there’s a little too much here). Indeed, some might wish the spotlight was on Ellis more, a fascinating character who may be the more musically gifted of the pair, but not as capable of holding the spotlight like Cave – who has his suits, rumbly baritone and carefully coiffed too-black hair. Nevertheless, there is much to enjoy, not least for fans of Marianne Faithfull, here on delightfully cranky form when called upon to contribute vocals for a performance.

5/11/2022,"Krishnan Guru-Murthy, 52, has worked on a variety of news programmes, from Newsround to Newsnight. He is currently the lead presenter of Channel 4 News, having taken over from Jon Snow in 2021, and also presents the documentary series Unreported World for the channel. What was the best thing you did on screen last year?The thing that stands out was going to America to cover the buildup to the George Floyd trial, and the protests that were going on. There was a sense that the pandemic had stifled progress on dealing with racism, and there was this buildup of emotion that spilt out on to the streets in the days before the verdict, with some people releasing pent-up feelings they had had for their whole lives. It was a striking period of time. What would you be doing if you weren’t a presenter?I had a place at medical school. My father was a doctor and I spent my childhood thinking I was going to be one, too. But looking back, I think if I had gone into medicine, I would’ve ended up quitting and maybe becoming a lawyer. Which TV show made you want to be on TVI never intended to get into my line of work, but I did grow up watching the likes of Robin Day on Question Time and Brian Walden on Weekend World, and thinking that it was amazing to be able to do in-depth political interviews and hold people to account. Have you ever been mistaken for anybody else?I’ve spent my lifetime being mistaken for other people, because a lot of people struggle to compute the idea that there’s more than one brown-faced person on the telly. Throughout my news career I’ve been mistaken for George Alagiah or Martin Bashir. What show had you gripped during the last year?Succession. It’s high drama, it’s comedic, it’s absurd, it’s dark – there’s so much in it. And there are constant reminders of its links to reality – you can’t ever get away from the fact that you’re thinking about the Murdochs. When was the last time the TV made you cry?The honest answer is probably when Mrs Mangel left Neighbours, which was about 30 years ago. What makes you angry?Three-quarters of what’s on my programme every day makes me angry. Who is the most famous person in your phone contacts?I’ve got a lot of politicians. I can tell you the one that impresses my kids the most, though: YouTuber KSI. We did a long interview for Channel 4 News last year – he’s a really interesting, thoughtful guy.

5/11/2022,"Ports and unions have cast doubt on the viability of legislation announced in the Queens Speech to ensure P&O and other ferry operators pay seafarers the minimum wage. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said that the new bill, introduced in response to P&O Ferries’ sacking of 800 crew, showed that the government would “stop at nothing” to ensure fair pay. However, the British Ports Association (BPA) said it was “unclear” that the legislation would work and said they could not enforce it, while the TUC dismissed the plans as unworkable. The Department for Transport said tens of thousands of seafarers would have to be paid the equivalent of the UK national minimum wage, currently £9.50 an hour, under provisions in the planned Harbours (Seafarers’ Remuneration) bill. The legislation will ban ferries that flout the pay rules from docking at UK ports. Talks are continuing with EU countries including France, Germany and Ireland to ensure routes between the countries become “minimum wage corridors”, guaranteeing minimum pay to seafarers operating them. Shapps said: “We will stop at nothing to make sure seafarers in UK ports are being paid fairly. P&O Ferries’ disgraceful actions do not represent the principles of our world-leading maritime sector, and changing the law on seafarer pay protection is a clear signal to everyone that we will not tolerate economic abuse of workers. “We will protect all seafarers regularly sailing in and out of UK ports and ensure they are not priced out of a job. Ferry operators which regularly call at UK ports will face consequences if they do not pay their workers fairly.” The government said it would consult closely with the ports and maritime sector on the scope of the new laws and enforcement measures over the next four weeks. Other vessels beyond ferries could be included. Cruise operators are known to pay far less than minimum wage to seafarers operating on ships out of Southampton. Possible enforcement measures include surcharges, suspension of port access and fines. The BPA said it was concerned by government expectations that ports should police shipping. The BPA chief executive, Richard Ballantyne, said: “The creation of new rules for ports to regulate ships in such a way is unprecedented. Enforcing the minimum wage is not an area where ports have a core competency. This should be a job for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency or HM Revenue and Customs. “It remains unclear whether the bill will achieve the government’s aims of improving longstanding issues for seafarers. Our initial assessment is that it might not be compatible with the UK’s obligations under international treaties or the current principles which governs our independent ports sector.” The TUC hit out at the government for dropping a promised employment bill that would have given greater rights and protection to all workers, including those at sea. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “This proposal is feeble and likely unworkable. “The government has done nothing to tackle the most flagrant labour abuse in years by P&O. Only stronger employment legislation that boosts worker protections and stops companies firing on the spot will prevent another P&O-type scandal.” Most of the 786 seafarers sacked by P&O Ferries in March were earning far more than the minimum wage, meaning the ferry operator would save millions in wages even after complying with new laws. The P&O Ferries chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, when appearing before MPs, said wage bills would also be slashed as new contracts would no longer cover seafarers’ rest periods between sailings and only “pay people when they work”.",News/Business,Ports and unions criticise Shapps’ plan for law on seafarers’ minimum wage,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/grant-shapps-law-seafarers-minimum-wage-queens-speech
5/11/2022,"Environmental campaign groups have hit out at the “draconian” protest crackdown bill announced in the Queen’s speech. The new law appears to be targeted at groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil and Insulate Britain who have used disruptive methods to draw attention to the climate crisis. Announcing the bill, Priti Patel said: “As the Queen’s speech outlined, the public order bill backs the police to prevent antisocial protests from disrupting people’s lives.” The home secretary hailed the “new criminal offences for ‘locking on’ and interfering with national infrastructure, and serious disruption prevention orders for reoffenders”. The new criminalisation of “locking on” is aimed at protesters who handcuff or glue themselves to infrastructure, a favourite tactic of green protest groups. Insulate Britain demonstrators made headlines last year after glueing themselves to major roads, and Extinction Rebellion members have previously handcuffed and glued themselves to trains, causing disruption. People who go equipped to lock themselves or others to buildings, roads or printing presses will also be committing an offence under the new bill. Extinction Rebellion members have previously targeted printing presses, delaying deliveries of national newspapers including the Telegraph, the Times and the Sun. Many have pointed out that progressive gains such as women’s right to vote, legalisation of trade unions and the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships are among laws that would probably not have happened without the type of protest the government is due to make illegal. Protester Gemma Rogers, 49, an NHS worker, founded the local campaign group Steve Baker Watch. She and other members are campaigning to ask their MP to leave the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a climate contrarian thinktank. She told the Guardian: “The proposed new powers in the bill, similar to those recently rejected by the House of Lords, are unnecessary and undemocratic. The reason the environmental movement is making a fuss is that there is a massive issue we are not addressing. It’s just crazy to lock up those raising the alarm.” James Miller, a co-founder of the green protest group Writers Rebel, added: “The draconian new public order bill will not stop us from protesting because the climate crisis isn’t going away – it’s only getting worse. “Our government has chosen to favour the short-term profit of their backers in the fossil fuel industry and rightwing media over the long-term interests of the people. Obviously, these policies are going to be unpopular because they’re reckless, harmful and wrong and that’s why the government is criminalising our right to protest.” Greenpeace said the government had the wrong priorities, and that it should not be criminalising those who were highlighting the climate crisis. Megan Randles, Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, said: “The right to protest is one of the safety valves of our democracy. It allows ordinary people to protect their health, families and homes from harm when all other safeguards have failed. The government’s attempt to criminalise peaceful dissent is a threat to everyone’s right to stand up for what they believe in. Time and again, it’s activism that has dragged a reluctant UK government into confronting vital issues, whether it’s the climate crisis or women’s rights. “Ministers who are so keen to talk about freedoms at every turn should rethink this attack on one of the most fundamental freedoms we have.” A spokesperson for Insulate Britain said: “Whilst the government continues the process of criminalising ordinary people, the criminals in charge of our government are in the process of destroying this country. Granting 41 new oil and gas licences is an act of war upon the poor of the global south and the people here in the UK. The new laws will change nothing. How many will be locked up until we realise there’s a problem society needs to address?” Protesters hope that there is enough opposition in parliament that the bill will not make it through, or at least will be watered down. Already, some MPs have spoken against it. The Green MP Caroline Lucas vowed to work with other parties to defeat the legislation. This is not a public order bill – it’s a public oppression bill. Will be working cross party again to defeat. Our right to peaceful protest should be protected, not attacked. Shame on Government for bringing back these dangerous proposals #QueensSpeech https://t.co/w4asVeSpFd The SNP MP Peter Grant added: “Q – What do votes for women, the abolition of slavery, legalisation of trade unions and the decriminalisation of same sex relationships have in common? A – None of them would have happened if people hadn’t protested in a way that the Tories want to make illegal.” The Labour MP Jon Trickett said: “The Tories are planning to further restrict the right to protest with a new public order bill. Rather than tackling injustice, they suppress dissent.”",News/Environment,‘Criminalising our right to protest’: green groups’ anger over public order bill,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/criminalising-our-right-to-protest-green-groups-anger-over-public-order-bill-queens-speech

5/11/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. At least 100 civilians remain in the Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor has said. Ukrainian officials have said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building that was destroyed weeks ago in the north-east of the country. The bodies were found in a five-storey building that collapsed in March in Izium. Russia’s underestimation of Ukrainian resistance and its “best-case scenario” planning have led to “demonstrable operational failings, preventing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from announcing significant military success in Ukraine” at the 9 May Victory Day parade, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said.

5/11/2022,"The first thing one notices about Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is that this episode is as tonally different to standard Marvel fare as a nightmarish fever dream is from waking reality. Almost alone among the studio’s directors, Sam Raimi has been allowed to put his unique stamp on the saga – it feels at least as close to the film-maker’s earlier horror efforts Evil Dead II and Drag Me to Hell as it does to films such as Spider-Man: No Way Home and the Avengers movies. Why is Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch suddenly the villain? Who is America Chavez and why is Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange a zombie version of himself? Let’s do a deep dive into the new film to find out. It has been quite the journey for Olsen’s character, from minor eastern European supervillain to fully paid-up member of the Avengers, to all-American housewife and now back to baddie in Multiverse of Madness. Despite having apparently found some kind of peace at the tail end of Disney+’s Wandavision, when she finally worked out it wasn’t cool to trap an entire town in her own heavily-stylised and rapidly shifting version of reality, Wanda now seems to have cracked again after coming into her full powers and chancing upon an evil book of dark magic known as the Darkhold. Her only mission is to reunite herself with the twin sons she discovered during Wandavision, Wiccan and Speed, having worked out that numerous alternative realities exist in which she and they live contented lives together. And yes, it’s a pity this ties into the sexist “mad mom” narrative that sees mothers as over-emotional creatures who make bad decisions because they love their children. Fortunately Olsen makes a wickedly evil protagonist, and one we know from the events of Wandavision is now powered-up to the extent that even Strange can’t take her down. How did you feel about her transition to supervillain? At the centre of Wanda’s focus is teenager America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who has the power to jump between universes but initially cannot control it. This soon brings her into contact with the Strange we know and love from the main Marvel timeline (now known as Earth-616), when he and Wong are called upon to battle a giant one-eyed, multi-tentacled demon that we eventually discover was sent by Wanda to trap Chavez. At this point, if you’re wondering why the Scarlet Witch sent such an enormous blunt instrument against someone who we assume needs to be alive to wield her powers – well, that’s just one of the many plotholes in Multiverse of Madness. We should also mention that Chavez is at least the third instrument we’ve now come across for the introduction of the Multiverse, after Strange’s spell gone wrong in Spider-Man: No Way Home and Wanda’s antics in Wandavision. Or maybe it was there all along? Either way, Multiverse of Madness is not the most consistent of Marvel films (perhaps because Raimi found out halfway through writing it that he was expected to follow on from the events of Wandavision), and sometimes it feels as if it belongs in its very own universe. Those who were unaware of Raimi’s penchant for fast-cutting, unusual camera angles and regular reanimation of corpses might have found themselves a little confused by the action – let us know if you found yourself in this category. On the other hand, if you’re a fan of Evil Dead II, did you feel like all your Halloweens had come at once? In an attempt to flee as Maximoff launches an assault on the mystical retreat of Kamar-Taj, America accidentally transports herself and Strange to a new universe in which technology is to the fore and the United States government appears to be run by the Green party. Here, they are captured by a fresh version of the sorcerer’s old enemy Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and brought before the Illuminati (Hayley Atwell’s Captain Carter, John Krasinski’s Reed Richards, Patrick Stewart’s Professor X, Lashana Lynch’s Captain Marvel and Anson Mount’s Black Bolt.) None of them last very long here, as they are swiftly sliced and diced by an all-powerful Wanda, but the castings could have a lasting effect on the main Marvel Cinematic Universe (Earth-616). This is the first major sign we’ve seen of mutants (from the X-Men movies) and the Fantastic Four appearing in the MCU, even though we already knew that Disney’s purchase of 20th Century Fox made it possible for Marvel to start incorporating characters it sold the big screen rights to back in the late 90s. Krasinski’s appearance could easily just be stunt-casting – there has been a high-profile fan campaign for the American actor and his real-life wife Emily Blunt to appear as Richards and Sue Storm in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot. Of the others, Patrick Stewart will be 82 in July, but you wouldn’t put it past him turning up again now he’s due to retire from Star Trek, following the upcoming third season of Picard. The Illuminati? This is an organisation that’s featured regularly in the comics, but with Tony Stark’s Iron Man dead in the main Marvel universe, it seems unlikely it will be turning up anytime soon in Earth-616. Perhaps the most long-lasting outcome of this encounter is that the Illuminati inform Strange that every version of himself in every universe ultimately becomes a force for evil. Turns out that episode of What If? was on the money after all. Can you see this revelation coming back to bite our hero in future? After being exiled to a ruined universe in which matter has turned upon itself, Earth-616 Strange meets a nefarious version of himself who has become corrupted by his own reality’s Darkhold, and sports a hideous third eye. He defeats his evil doppelganger, but in the movie’s final scene we see him bend over in agony as his own forehead pops out a horrifying extra peeper. This, presumably, is the result of having used the Darkhold to inhabit the dead version of himself we saw in the film’s opening scenes and rescue Chavez from Wanda, who had been casting a spell to finally steal those inter-dimensional powers. Fortunately, a mid-credits scene shows that Strange has become swiftly accustomed to having triple sight – in the comics the Sorcerer Supreme is often able to use the extra eye without any creepy after-effects, even if it’s pretty grim to look at, and it seems to be the same Eye of Agamotto that our Strange wears around his neck (and once housed the Time Stone). Where does Multiverse of Madness leave Strange? He’s certainly still the MCU’s central defender against the forces of evil in the absence of Stark, particularly now that alternate realities have become such a big part of the movie saga. That mid-credits scene, in which Charlize Theron’s Clea appears and opens a portal to another universe, suggests that we’re moving into a new era in which the latter could be his love interest, rather than Rachel McAdams’ Christine Palmer. In the comics, Clea eventually becomes Strange’s wife, so how do you think this will set up the events of Doctor Strange 3?",Arts/Film,"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: tonal shifts, misogyny and new superheroes – discuss with spoilers",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/10/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-tonal-shifts-misogyny-and-new-superheroes-discuss-with-spoilers
5/11/2022,"Ukrainian and Russian military officials have claimed advances in the battles for the south and east, dominated by a 300-mile-long frontline, as in many places the conflict turns into a long-range shelling war between the two sides. Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa has come under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles, leaving at least one person dead. The governor of Luhansk reported “very serious battles” in the frontline areas of Bilogorivka and Rubizhne. In the town of Bogodukhov, north-west of Kharkiv, four people were killed and several homes were destroyed in Russian attacks on Monday, local media quoted Kharkiv officials as saying. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to finish off the city’s last-ditch defenders and complete the capture of the strategically vital port. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. It was thought that all remaining civilians were evacuated on Saturday, but on Tuesday an aide to the mayor said at least 100 were still to leave. Video published by a Russia-backed separatist group on 4 May appears to show an attack on the plant. It is unclear when it was filmed: Footage published on 3 May showed smoke raising from the steelworks: Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/11/2022,"A trade union has enforced a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to stop a female former employee repeating allegations of sexual harassment against the union’s general secretary. The Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) was granted an injunction on Sunday night to prevent a former organiser, Claire Laycock, from breaching a confidentiality clause in a compromise agreement signed in November. Laycock, who worked for the TSSA for several years as an organiser in Yorkshire, had claimed that she was harassed by the union’s general secretary, Manuel Cortes, in a pub after a Christmas party in 2018. Cortes vehemently denies harassment and has apologised for any hurt caused by his behaviour. The union, which represents white-collar workers in the transport industry, said it had conducted an inquiry into the claims, which were not upheld. The use of NDAs in cases where sexual harassment has been alleged has been heavily criticised since the #MeToo movement. Confidentiality clauses are often written in to the settlement of employment cases, but campaigners argue that their use by companies and organisations has become endemic and say they can be misused to suppress details of wrongdoing including sexual harassment, discrimination and racism. The TSSA sought an injunction on Sunday night after Laycock repeated allegations of sexual harassment against Cortes and bullying claims against senior staff members in a video uploaded to Reel News, a website run by a collective in London. She claimed that Cortes had put his arm around her shoulder and asked her to kiss him at a Christmas party. She claimed that later that same evening, he asked her to “go outside” with him. According to Laycock, at a subsequent informal meeting attended by union reps Cortes apologised, saying he could not remember all his actions on that night and that he had been drinking. The TSSA said it had investigated Laycock’s allegations twice and her claims were not upheld. On Sunday, the union sought an injunction against Laycock, Reel News and a named publisher of the material. Mr Justice Fordham, presiding, said in his judgment: “The claimant’s application contends that this, on the face of it, is a case of an egregious breach by the third defendant [Laycock] of the non-disclosure agreement, known as a ‘COT3’, dated 15 November 2021.” The judge ruled in favour of a two-day interim injunction imposed just on Laycock. No injunction was imposed on Reel News or its publisher. The union will again seek an extension of the injunction on Tuesday in the high court. It has also emerged that a report on sexism in the union was conducted in June by a GMB branch that represents some TSSA staff. The GMB branch report recommended an in-depth independent inquiry into sexual harassment and management of sexual harassment complaints. Staff at the TSSA said the report’s recommendations had not been acted upon. The TSSA said only 18 out of 48 staff members responded to the GMB survey, that some of the questions were not specific to the TSSA, and that the union had commissioned an independent report by an academic examining the culture and practices of the union. A spokesperson for the union said the TSSA has not, does not and will not seek to silence wrongdoing. “Upon leaving employment with TSSA, Ms Laycock signed an Acas-negotiated agreement which ensured that she was always fully entitled to make valid disclosures of all and any information. “What it did not permit, was for her to repeat allegations which were always strenuously denied, and after a thorough investigation were not upheld. Following further consideration on appeal in the union that position was confirmed. “The obligations in the Acas-negotiated agreement were mutual – ie applying to both TSSA and Ms Laycock, and TSSA has tried to respect that. “Acas-negotiated agreements when there is a dispute are an important and valid tool for workers and employers to use. It is important they are respected. TSSA is utterly opposed to sexism and harassment in all its forms,” she said. Regarding their own inquiry into the culture of the TSSA, the spokesperson said an independent report was being carried out by a third party “to look at whether our policies, practices and culture provide a safe space for all our members and staff”.",News/Politics,Union enforces NDA to stop woman repeating sexual harassment allegation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/union-enforces-nda-to-stop-woman-repeating-sexual-harassment-allegation
5/11/2022,"More than 3.2m households in the UK got a pet during the pandemic. For three-quarters of these new pet owners, a new animal has been a boost to their mental health in difficult times. But there is more to having a pet than having a furry companion to cuddle on the sofa, as the 5% of new owners who had returned their pet by March 2021 found out. Just like millions of Brits, I have also been toying with the idea of getting a pet – a cat, to be specific. It turns out, there are many things I hadn’t considered, not least of all how important it is to feed your cat food that is specifically tailored to their stage of life. Clare Hemmings, a qualified former veterinary nurse and scientific communications manager at Royal Canin – who has owned 19 cats over the years, and is fascinated by the power of nutrition – says: “If you change their diet, you could make a difference to the overall health and wellbeing of the animal.” Royal Canin has developed a nutrition range tailored to meet the needs of healthy cats of all sizes, breeds, lifestyles and tastes. These are further grouped by stage of life, an important factor that owners must take into consideration when choosing their cat’s food, says Hemmings. Kittens (six weeks to 12 months)Kittens need to eat very different food to fully grown cats and it’s vital for them to eat right in order to grow into healthy adults. “Kittens must have a specific omega-3 fatty acid called DHA, which is really important for brain function,” says Hemmings. “Their immune system is immature, the digestion is immature, and they’ve got a lot of growing to do – they can go from a few grams to three or four kilos [in their first year of their life]. So they need very specific levels of protein, calcium and phosphorus and, importantly, these must be in the correct ratio.” While eating right is important for kittens, it’s vital not to overfeed them. “Their bodies aren’t equipped to decide how much they need,” says Hemmings. “So if you ever feed them lots of raw meat, for example, or extra bone meal for strong bones, or extra cheese, or milk, or whatever, you can end up giving them too much calcium, and that can unbalance their calcium and phosphorus ratio, which may lead to deformities.” The first weeks and months are also about forming healthy food habits that will last into adulthood. “One of the problems in kittenhood is that we feed them in a way that we want to eat, which can override their hunger signals. So, you know, we’ll feed them two or three times a day and we give them a big pile of food or a whole pouch at a time. They don’t want to eat that much. “Our studies have shown that cats would rather eat 14 to 20 tiny meals a day. The ideal is to feed a little portion of wet food in the morning, then leave dry food down for the day for them to nibble on. If you want to give them another portion of wet food later on, great. If you just want to feed them dry, great. “They need to know food is always available to them. If they haven’t had that experience when they’re young, they get to adulthood and overeat because they don’t know when they will get their next meal.” Adults (one to seven years old)While kittens need nutrition for rapid growth, when a cat reaches adulthood the priority switches to a maintenance diet tailored to its breed. Take sphynxes, for example. “They have a much higher energy requirement than other cats,” says Hemmings. “So they have to have more calories, but they have to be fed in an energy-dense format because sphynxes have short guts. They also have a genetic predisposition to a specific heart condition, so we include elevated or higher levels of taurine to help support heart health.” While there is a huge range of variables to consider when it comes to cat food, surprisingly, taste isn’t one of them. “Cats aren’t interested in flavours; they only have 500 tastebuds compared with a human’s 9,000. But they’ve got a really good sense of smell.” This fact is lost on many cat owners, who project human ideas about what makes food great on to their pets, sometimes with devastating results. “Ingredients are just a vehicle for bringing nutrients,” says Hemmings. “Like a delivery van brings a package, I don’t care who brings the package as long as they arrive on time and with the right things. But people follow trends on the internet, which can cause health issues.” Feline veganism is one such problem that Hemmings warns cat owners against. “People make their pets follow human trends of cutting down on meat, but you just can’t have a vegetarian or vegan cat. Often people say: ‘Oh, my cat’s really healthy’ on some vegetarian diet, and the cat is actually going out and finding meat elsewhere. But if they’re unable to do this, at some point it can lead to very serious health challenges.” Maturity and beyond (seven years and older)“When cats age, their bodily functions begin to slow down,” says Hemmings. “They start to lose their sense of taste and smell.” To keep older cats interested in their food, Royal Canin’s formulations focus on texture, while also packing in antioxidants that provide support through the ageing process. This is particularly important for cats older than 12. “They need specific nutrients to address the effects of ageing, like dental care and old joints,” says Hemmings. As important as it is to continue closely watching your cat’s nutrition as it ages, the foundations of a mature cat’s health are laid in the preceding years, and maintaining a healthy weight throughout a cat’s life is one surefire way to improve its older years. “We know from our studies that if you have obese cats, it can reduce the life expectancy by 1.9 years,” says Hemmings. “And that’s really significant when they only live to maybe 14.” You don’t need to be a mind reader or body language expert to know what your cat needs to eat – at every stage of life, they require food tailored to them.

5/11/2022,"Hayley Miranda, a 28-year-old contemporary dance producer, had never considered herself a cat person. “In fact,” she says, “I’ve always hated cats. But then I went to Greece last summer with my boyfriend and while there we found this four-week-old kitten, stray and alone. It ended up staying with us in our Airbnb for a few days until we found a shelter.” They returned to the UK, but Miranda had fallen in love with the kitten and wanted to adopt it. “A week before the kitten was due to come here, the woman at the shelter told us it was going to cost £1,000 to bring it here,” Miranda says. “We had to decide against it, which was really depressing, because we had fallen in love with this kitten.” Tato and Tina Her heart set on adopting, Miranda looked into rehoming kittens in the UK. “I found two at this shelter at Abbey Wood … we drove there, met these two cats, fell in love with them and then a week later brought them back home. It was such a whirlwind. That’s how we ended up with Tina and Tato. Everybody has these ideas that rescue animals are going to be terrible, but my two cats are the friendliest cats.” Miranda Larbi, 32, is another kitten adopter. Larbi grew up with cats; her parents adopted several rescues over the years. So when a friend told her that her cat was expecting kittens, Larbi asked about adopting one. On New Year’s Eve, she picked up Lemi. Miranda Larbi with Lemi Bonding with an adopted or rescue kitten is crucial. Having had cats when she was younger, Larbi says that she has always felt how you treat a cat early on can affect its temperament. “My thing is that me and my cats need to reach an understanding: you’re here as my emotional sucker and I’m here to be your emotional sucker,” she says. “So I’m going to pick you up all the time … and in return I would like you to purr and be present in my life.” Larbi and her partner make sure to shower Lemi with love and attention, “although, obviously, you have to leave it alone when it’s eating or cleaning itself”, she says. “But the more tactile and intimate you are with a kitten, the more relaxed and sociable it’s going to be.” One way that you can get on your new kitten’s good side is by giving them healthy, nutritious food. This is especially important for rescue cats that may not have had access to their ideal diet at a shelter, says Clare Hemmings, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin. “The first thing to do when you bring them home is to not change their food straight away. Once you’ve let them settle in, then you can start giving them something that is really going to support their digestion,” Hemmings says. “With a brand like Royal Canin, we know that our food is high quality and very digestible. It’s specifically designed to support ideal, healthy growth once they’re in their new home. Often, if they’ve come from a poor start in life, they haven’t got very strong immunity or may have a fragile digestive tract, and all of that could make them feel bad. It will make them more susceptible to illnesses, but they may also have a stomach ache a lot of the time. They are unlikely to feel confident if they have to stay near their litter tray.” Cats can often eat up to 20 small meals a day, so feeding your kitten little and often is preferable. “They can then monitor and regulate themselves,” Hemmings says. “They’re less likely to get overweight when they’re older and they don’t feel that stress of wondering where their next meal is coming from if they can access food at all times.” It’s important not to disturb your kitten while it’s eating. You also don’t need to give your cats treats in order to get them on side, either. “Treats are a human thing,” Clare says. “You can actually just use a few kibbles from their daily diet as treats. You can enrich their environments by using things like activity feeders or by scatter feeding, where if you have dry food you can just scatter it so that cats can use their natural hunting instinct to find it. It’s about environmental enrichment, really, and food can play a part in that.” For Miranda, food has been a key part of bonding with Tato and Tina. “We noticed a difference when we started feeding them the right food. They wanted to spend more time with us, so I think they appreciated us feeding them food that they liked.” Larbi agrees: “Knowing that the food we give Lemi is really nutritious ultimately means that we’re going to have a happy cat.” “It’s crazy,” Miranda adds. “My entire kitchen has turned into this cat room. I even went to a pottery class and made their food bowls. I’m a total cat convert.” Learn more about settling your new kitten into its new home at Royal Canin",Feline feeding,How to bond with a rescue kitten – and why healthy food is so important,https://www.theguardian.com/feline-feeding/2022/may/10/how-to-bond-with-a-rescue-kitten-and-why-healthy-food-is-so-important
5/11/2022,"As the first cat was domesticated more than 4,000 years ago, you’d think we’d have them figured out by now. But no. We still expect them to fit in with our modern lives with zero compatibility issues, despite the fact that cats are fundamentally solitary hunters so naturally they behave differently – it’s in their DNA. To hone your animal instincts, animal behaviourist, cat expert and author Anneleen Bru decodes cat behaviour for beginners. “Most people know that flattened ears signal an unhappy cat, but you’ve missed 90% of the conversation by not using other visible body signals, with its whiskers, tail, fur, eyes, purr, paws and toilet habits … Once you know what these are, it can be much easier to have a good relationship with your feline,” she says. What they do: rub around your legsWhat it means: ‘I feel good’“Often a cat will do this if you are preparing their food,” says Bru. “It means: ‘I like this person, I feel safe, I’m happy.’” Cats use pheromones in a very clever way – think of it as leaving scented Post-It notes around their core living space. Rubbing against certain furniture is reinforcing a message that it’s their happy place. What they do: flash their bumWhat it means: ‘I like you’When a cat flashes its derriere to another cat they are being really welcoming. “It’s their way of saying to another cat: ‘Hello, I like you,’” explains Bru. “So, when they do that to us, their humans, it means the same thing.” What they do: purrWhat it usually means: ‘I’m happy and chilled’What it sometimes means: ‘I’m stressed and in pain’“Mostly, purring is pure contentment, but sometimes it can be a sign of stress, anxiety, or illness. Cats don’t show pain, but they exhibit subtle changes in their behaviour instead. In these instances, purring offers relief to an anxious or stressed cat, in effect they are trying to self-soothe.” Tip: If your cat has always purred and stops, see a vet as it could indicate a health issue. Equally, if it doesn’t normally purr, but starts, see your vet. Any sudden behaviour changes could be a sign your cat needs veterinary treatment. What they do: sleep in weird placesWhat it means: ‘I’m keeping myself safe’“As a solitary hunter, cats like to sleep up high so they are safe and aware of their surroundings,” says Bru. “Sleeping up high, or in hidden places, like cardboard boxes or in cupboards or drawers, is in their DNA. It’s how they survive. Let them do it.” What they do: padWhat it means: ‘I’m chilling and really enjoying myself’“This is real self-soothing behaviour that goes back to kittenhood,” says Bru. “It’s the action that kittens do to release the milk at their mother’s teats, often this action can send them into a real trance and cats will do this until their final years. It’s the epitome of a happy cat.” What they do: close their eyes, while sitting close to youWhat it means: ‘I love you’“This is the equivalent of a cat’s kiss,” says Bru. “If you open your eyes wide and close them while looking at your cat, it’s telling them you love them back. It’s cat whispering. Try it.” What they do: flatten their whiskersWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’Whiskers are super-sensitive radar devices for cats as they struggle to focus on anything an arm’s length from their face. Their long, coarse whiskers have highly sensitive nerve endings at the roots – they can determine if prey is close by and what space is around them. What they do: stare at other catsWhat it means: ‘I hate them’“This is the feline equivalent of giving the other the middle finger,” says Bru. “Don’t ever think that two cats staring at each other is going to lead to anything gentle. It won’t.” What they do: drop their tailWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’“A straight up tail, or one held in a question-mark shape, is the sign of a happy cat,” says Bru. “This is the complete opposite.” What they do: flatten their earsWhat it means: ‘Leave me alone’ (sensing a pattern?)The most obvious sign you have an unhappy cat. Combine it with an arched back, bushy coat, flattened ears, erect bushy tail, deep moaning and you have a very, very grumpy cat. What they do: pee in your trainersWhat it means: ‘You need to sort out my litter tray situation’“In the wild, cats will pee and poo in different places,” explains Bru. “A cat is programmed to bury its poo to hide from predators, its pee is less of an issue so it will do that elsewhere. Also, cats prefer to use a litter tray that is high up and hidden so they feel less vulnerable. Look at your litter tray setup and change it accordingly.” What they do: spray urine on vertical areasWhat it means: ‘I’m worried about something in this place’“If not neutered, your cat, male or female, will spray as a sexual marking,” says Bru. “If neutered, this is a stress sign – look at what may have changed in the environment, such as the threat of other (unfamiliar) cats who may be able to enter or stare into the house.” What they do: yawnWhat it means: ‘I’m chilled’Usually a yawn is a relaxed signal of your cat releasing stress and relaxing. This is another chance for you to communicate with them. Yawn back and see what happens. What they do: gently bite you during pettingWhat it means: ‘This is gooood’A gentle nibble means serious appreciation; a harder one may suggest your cat is a little overstimulated, so perhaps give them some space. What they do: bring you dead animalsWhat it means: ‘You’re a terrible hunter’Bringing home a kill is often more common in females than males – some research suggests by bringing home the kill, the cat has adopted you as part of its family and its DNA says it has to feed you and teach you how to hunt. However, it’s also just what they do, cats are hardwired to hunt – some more so than others. Bringing home a kill actually has nothing to do with you, says Bru. “Cats will stalk and kill prey, even when they don’t have the intention of eating it. They will bring it to their core area, because this is where they feel safe.” You don’t need to be a mind reader or body language expert to know what your cat needs to eat – at every stage of life, they require food tailored to them.

5/11/2022,"Last night, Keir Starmer performed as The Gambler in a tiny space with cheap scenery and three journalists. The Labour leader’s promise to resign if Durham police issue him with a fixed penalty notice looked like an off-off-off-Broadway production that can only run to four actors who play all the parts. (No spoilers, but some of the above will return in later scenes as the executioners). As such, it certainly marks a new entry into the annals of hilariously mad-looking press conferences. For me, the only thing missing was Tiger Woods’ mum sitting purse-lipped in the front row, like she was in 2010 when Tiger apologised to the world for his cocktail waitress habit. “Integrity” was the big buzzword on that occasion, as it was with Starmer yesterday, with Woods promising “to start living a life of integrity”. Didn’t win a major again for nine years. So … read into that what you will. Starmer’s soliloquy certainly wasn’t good enough for the Daily Mail, which this morning has wet its collective pants that the Labour leader has had the temerity to answer the one question the Mail would have screamed at him for months if he hadn’t. As their Depend-wearing splash headline has it: “STARMER ACCUSED OF PILING PRESSURE ON POLICE”. I like the idea that you can “pressurise” the police. Can someone let me know how to do this, because I’m yet to receive so much as a callback over a burglary that took place over the Easter weekend. Happy to do an am-dram Tiger if necessary. The main thing to understand is that after months of their unilateral “special operation” on Beergate, this is the Mail’s victory parade. Today’s multi-article offering is the heavy artillery being wheeled through Fleet Street’s Red Square. There’s the classic late 1980s Stephen Glover missile (couple of near misses on the job but still claimed to be serviceable). Later-years weaponry tells its own sadly diminished story, of course. The supposedly state-of-the-art Wootton drone is actually just a Canon DSLR taped inside some bulky casing. But the big question on some lips is: have the game theorists at the Mail made a strategic miscalculation, effectively steering Tory MPs up the escalation ladder towards moving against their boy Johnson? For those of us who feel like this entire mushrooming shitshow is like watching the Cuban missile crisis re-enacted by the cast of Made in Chelsea, the signs are promising/infuriating (delete according to taste). Miscalculation certainly seems to be the judgment of Islington-based newsletter writer Dominic Cummings, who fired off another of his occasionally coherent tweets yesterday afternoon, in which he electronically cackled at the sight of supposed client journalists messing up their forward induction, and ending up accidentally working for the other side. Which is to say: for him. As Dominic had it, everyone in Westminster is “working on the Vote Leave operation to remove” Boris Johnson. Maybe. Either way, one of my very favourite things in politics is Cummings acting like Vote Leave is still a massive thing. He reminds me of Gary King, the Simon Pegg character in The World’s End, insisting to his deeply unwilling ex-friends that they get back together to recreate their epic pub crawl from 23 years earlier. “Fucking hell, Caino! What do you mean you don’t drink any more? That’s like a lion eating hummus!”. In fact, now that Benedict Cumberbatch has had his fun, I’d truly love to see what Pegg would do with the role of “Dominic Cummings”. You just know it would be it incredibly funny, but also elegiac and quietly heartbreaking. As for Starmer, the film that came to mind while watching his press conference was the South Park movie. When Keir was going “It’s about me! It’s about what I believe in politics! It’s a matter of integrity!”, I was reminded of the Canadian guy shouting “This is not aboot diplomacy! This is aboot dignity! This is aboot respect!”, and all the Americans falling about laughing. I mean, the Canadian guy IS actually in the right, but … yeah. A hard watch. I’m actually trying to think how any of this, at all, could now be more excruciating. At least no one has yet suggested David Miliband standing in Wakefield. Against the backdrop of the actually excruciating cost of living crisis, however, the current spectacle is looking increasingly surreal. And, dare I say it, increasingly like an all-male production. Even Angela Rayner’s promise to also resign if she was given an FPN happened offstage, like the death of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. From the snapper of the Beergate photograph (James Delingpole’s boy, as it turns out), to the Mail thrusters, to Cummings, to the weird machismo of Johnson’s reported description of Starmer as out of tune with the “raw instincts” of Brits, I can’t help noticing of late that women characters have sort of melted away/backed away from this increasingly histrionic story. Why is that? Just some mad statistical fluke I guess. Even so, I can’t help feeling that ladies across the nation are otherwise engaged, perhaps answering work emails at midnight while putting on a dark wash, sourcing a schoolchild’s platinum jubilee costume and wondering how on earth they’re going to bridge the gap between last May’s energy bills and this May’s. Thank heavens for the less emotional sex, then, who are out there in Red Square living their victorious lives for the rest of us.

5/11/2022,"The pandemic turned the US into a next-day delivery nation. Amazon, in particular, saw sales surge during the dark days of Covid. In the first three months of 2021, the company watched its total sales tick up by 44%, constituting $8.1bn in profit. Those sales were led by the 200 million subscribers to Amazon’s super-fast delivery service Prime as people demanded everything from desk chairs to bananas delivered the next day. Amazon sold 44% more items during the pandemic, but the cost of fulfilling those orders increased by only 31%. This saving was one of scale – high-order volume allowed Amazon to operate even more efficiently. “It has run its warehouses closer to full capacity, and delivery drivers have made more stops on their routes, with less time driving between customers,” reported the New York Times. During that period of lockdowns, Amazon’s quick delivery became a lifeline for many people. But as we approach a return to a more normal life, many of us are investigating the various habits and proclivities we unconsciously established during Covid. Do we want to go back to the office? Are we satisfied with our current employment situation? And is the endless cycle of cardboard arriving at our doorsteps putting an undue strain on the planet, on our infrastructure, and on the human spirit? Amazon Prime ships about 1.6m packages a day. That operation is buoyed by a worldwide logistics team which rumbles all day and night. Isn’t that a little gluttonous? Or, as M Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, put it in an interview with NPR: “You don’t need a pair of socks to get to you swiftly. It probably makes just as much sense to get it to you efficiently.” For Amazon workers, this means working at an extraordinary pace. Jacob, who joined Amazon two years ago, says he has logged a total of 30,000 miles, and 400 routes. He is frequently saddled with shifts that force him to deliver to “70 separate three-story buildings” with more than 350 packages. “I was logging over 120 flights of stairs on my Fitbit,” he tells the Guardian. “Amazon constantly reminds us they put profits over their workers,” he says. “I ended up having a normal 200-plus stop day on Easter Sunday. Zero mercy shown.” The physical toll bears out in the data. According to a survey of workers in a Long Island Amazon warehouse, 42% reported physical pain in their day-to-day duties – usually in the feet and lower back. (They also noted psychological pressures and a deterioration of their normal sleep schedules.) “I do feel like the workload is unreasonable,” says another driver interviewed by the Guardian, who asked to remain anonymous. “There is no time to break. It is impossible to complete a route, and take your breaks, and be back to the station in time.” In the past eight years there have been hundreds of accidents involving Amazon vehicles, including at least six deaths, which were documented in BuzzFeed News investigation in 2019. But it is difficult to know the exact figures, given the way Amazon outsources its delivery apparatus to a worldwide network of companies. In total, BuzzFeed identified at least 250 outsourced dispatchers who work with Amazon. In many cities Amazon is promising packages in as little as five hours, or tells customers they can order by midnight and receive products the next morning. Would more time to make deliveries lead to a more equitable work environment? Jacob says an earlier cutoff for next-day delivery orders could give Amazon employees more time to breathe, but he also isn’t sure if customers would accept having to wait longer. “The standard has been raised,” he says. There are also questions about how sustainable this relentless pace is within the climate emergency. There are two differing philosophies about the emission impact of next-day delivery. Some argue that by streamlining the flow of products – bundling up all of our assorted consumption needs into parcels on a shared conveyor belt – we are taking the cars off the road that would previously be making routine trips to local strip malls. “The question is always, ‘What are we replacing?’” says Miguel Jaller, a professor at UC Davis and co-director of the Sustainable Freight Research program. “If you’re replacing a two-gallon-per-mile large SUV going every day to a store far away, then we’re benefiting the environment.” Amazon has claimed it will reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 (and has already made some strides in that arena – they remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy). But given the sheer diversity of items available on Amazon and other e-commerce retailers, experts say it becomes more difficult to assert that next-day delivery streamlines the supply chain. The average Prime order might constitute radically different items, which are both guaranteed to make it to your doorstep in 24 hours or less. “It gets harder to consolidate,” Anne Goodchild, a professor of engineering at the University of Washington, told Vox. “I think it’s easy to overlook how much travel we’re adding.” This is complicated further by Amazon’s reliance on contract labor, many of which use trucks that are considerably smaller than the giant 18-wheelers that haul fresh stock to bricks-and-mortar retailers, and generally carry a much heavier carbon footprint given their limited storage space. (In total, those vehicles are responsible for one0quarter of all carbon emissions in the transportation category.) In general, Jaller is unconvinced that the industry’s continued focus on speed above everything lends itself to a carbon-neutral model. “They started pushing one-day delivery and then they started pushing one-hour delivery. The faster you’re providing a service, the less likely you’re able to be [environmentally] efficient,” he says. Jaller does recommend a few remediesincluding a pivot to zero-emission vehicles. But generally speaking, experts believe that the path towards a sustainable, livable, non-exploitative future must begin with a shift in our social priorities. “It’s not a massive chunk of your total environmental impact, but every decision a consumer makes has some impact,” says Austin Whitman, CEO of the non-profit Climate Neutral, when I asked him if he believes next-day delivery can coexist within the ethical posture of any conscious shopper. “Should you put it on your list of the top 10 things to avoid? Absolutely.” Kai Lendwehr, the press officer of the environmental non-profit MyClimate, agrees. He advocates for a reorientation in the relentless parameters of consumption. Instead of searching for a supply-chain apparatus that sustainably satiates our demands, maybe we simply need to be wondering if we truly need the things we’re purchasing in the first place. “It’s about conscious buying,” he says. “Decide what you need, do some research, focus on quality, on things that make you feel suitable for a longer timeframe, and then click the green button. It shouldn’t really matter when the product arrives.”",News/Technology,"Exhausted workers, polluting journeys: how unethical is next-day delivery?",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/next-day-delivery-unethical-amazon-workers-pollution
5/11/2022,"A British man and his Filipina wife say they are facing imprisonment in Belarus and will miss out on starting a family via surrogacy because of UK delays in visa processing. Graeme Batsman, a data security expert from Harrow, and his wife, Maura Mendez Arganda, travelled to Vitebsk oblast, Belarus, in February to arrange a surrogate birth that would cost them £25,000. But they face losing that arrangement and their liberty, in a plight that exposes the human cost of visa processing problems in the UK. As their Belarus travel visa expires this week, they have been warned by local officials that they if they do not leave the country by Friday they will be imprisoned and fined. But they cannot leave because Arganda submitted her passport to the UK as part of a separate attempt to apply for a British visa that appears to be stuck in mounting backlog of cases. If the couple overstay their Belarus visa they face a five-year travel ban to Belarus, so they would miss out on a surrogacy arrangement that has already cost them $18,000 (£14,582) with a further $13,000 to pay when the baby is born. Speaking by phone from Belarus, Batsman said: “I’ve told the Foreign Office that I’m going to be calling them from a jail soon and they haven’t done anything.” He added: “If nothing is done, the UK government will be responsible for imprisoning us, a fine of perhaps €500 each, deportation and a travel ban. No one wants to stay in a jail and it will mean no baby for us.” Their dilemma emerged as evidence grew about the scale of problems caused by visa delays. More than 150 couples have complained to the BBC that they have also been hit by visa processing problems. Many have been waiting more than double the expected time for processing visas, the BBC reported. “It’s an admin issue – but that admin issue has now just stopped life,” Deon Barnard said as he and his wife wait for a spousal visa. Batsman said he had repeatedly called in vain for help from UK officials, ministers, and to a 69p-a-minute visa helpline. “I’ve emailed all sorts of ministers, everyone has been a jobsworth and has just passed us on. I have said to many people by email, or phone call, you will be responsible for endangering a British citizen and his Filipina wife.” Arganda first applied for a six-month visa to the UK in October last year. Despite 40 pages of supporting documents, supplied by Batsman, the application was refused on the basis that she had insufficient means. The couple got married in Odesa in January on a trip to Ukraine, where before the war more than 2,000 babies a year were born through surrogacy. As Russian troops massed on the border, the newlyweds abandoned their search for a surrogate mother in the country. After a failed search for surrogacy in Armenia, they then applied in February for a Belarusian visa with the sponsorship of a surrogacy clinic. Arganda applied for a UK visa again at the start of March, now as Batsman’s wife. The couple were told a decision was made on 7 April but they have received nothing since and her passport has not been returned. The Home Office has been approached for comment about Arganda’s case. It claims general visa delays have been caused by the situation in Ukraine. An official told the BBC: “We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine applications in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, so applications for study, work and family visas have taken longer to process. We are working at pace to ensure these are issued as quickly as possible.”",News/UK news,Couple face Belarus prison and loss of surrogate child amid UK visa delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/couple-belarus-prison-surrogate-child-uk-visa-delays
5/11/2022,"Liz Truss is reportedly preparing draft legislation that would unilaterally scrap key parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, removing the need for checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No bill was announced in the Queen’s speech on Tuesday but the foreign secretary is reported to have asked officials to prepare the draft, which would put the UK in breach of its treaty obligations. As well as scrapping checks, the draft legislation would also take away powers of the European court of justice and remove all requirement for Northern Irish businesses to follow EU regulations. A government source confirmed Truss intended to move unilaterally to prepare to change parts of the protocol but denied the UK government had given up on negotiation. Truss is understood to have formed the view that the UK cannot wait for negotiations to conclude before preparing to act unilaterally, given the election results in Northern Ireland over the weekend. Senior UK sources emphasised that stability in Northern Ireland was at stake with the glacial pace of talks and while the EU has made clear that its mandate is not set to change. Some cabinet ministers, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, were said to be uneasy about the high stakes involved in Truss’s strategy and the possibility of a trade war with the EU as the UK stands on the brink of a potential recession. Cabinet sources suggested Truss’s manoeuvres were part of “leadership feather-fluttering” – hinting they were designed to put her at odds with Sunak in the minds of Conservative backbenchers. Sources close to Gove and Sunak denied they were trying to block Truss’s plans. The draft bill was initially understood to be intended to grant ministers the power in principle to override the treaty – but not necessarily to be used in practice. However, the Times reported on Tuesday that the bill would go further than expected and scrap parts of the protocol. Such a move is expected to provoke legal retaliation by the EU were it to go ahead – including the bloc potentially imposing new tariffs. Truss will argue that the election results in Northern Ireland give the negotiations a fresh sense of urgency because the Democratic Unionist party has said it will boycott any participation in a new government at Stormont until the issue is resolved. Sinn Féin, which won the most seats at Stormont for the first time, said Northern Ireland was becoming “collateral damage” in the dispute. Boris Johnson spoke to Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, on Tuesday morning. No 10 said he underlined the grave situation in Northern Ireland and reiterated warnings about the protocol. “Despite repeated efforts by the UK government over many months to fix the protocol, including those sections related to the movement of goods and governance, the European Commission had not taken the steps necessary to help address the economic and political disruption on the ground,” No 10 said of the call. “The prime minister reiterated that the UK government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found.” A UK government spokesperson said: “Our focus has been, and will continue to be, preserving peace and stability in Northern Ireland. No decisions have yet been taken on the way forward. However, the situation is now very serious. “We have always been clear that action will be taken to protect the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement if solutions cannot be found to fix the protocol.” The Irish deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who reached agreement with Johnson on the protocol in October 2019, suggested the UK was using threats to gain leverage in negotiations. However, he warned the UK could not simply “resile” from the international treaty by unilaterally tearing up the protocol. “If that is their approach, then we have a real problem here,” he told RTÉ. “It’s one thing to engage in a bit of sabre rattling ... but if they were to actually go down that route, it will be very serious.” Labour’s Jenny Chapman, a shadow minister, said the action “risks a trade war during a cost of living crisis”.",News/UK news,Liz Truss ‘preparing to scrap parts of Northern Ireland protocol’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/liz-truss-preparing-to-tear-up-northern-ireland-protocol-reports
5/11/2022,"The Home Office has admitted that lesbian, gay and bisexual refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda – but still plans to fly them 4,000 miles to Kigali. The department’s equality impact assessment for the policy states there are “concerns” over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people in the east African country, and that investigations point to “ill treatment” of this group being “more than one off”. It comes the day after the Home Office said the first group of people would be informed this week of the government’s intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights were expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. In the report released on Monday, the assessment says “there are concerns over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people but we will continue to consider the impact on this group and take into account further evidence over the course of the partnership”. The report notes that homosexuality was decriminalised in 2010, but warns: “At this stage, investigations point to ill treatment being more than one off, but it does not appear to be systemic.” The government’s assessment of Rwanda’s human rights record, states that there are “not substantial grounds” for believing they would be at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European convention of human rights in Rwanda. At the same time, the Foreign Office travel advice for Rwanda states that “individuals can experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities. There are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals.” Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the risk assessment was an unrealistic assessment of a country with a poor human rights record. “The Home Office’s report reads like some serious wishful thinking and they seem to change the facts in order to justify a preordained conclusion. From claiming that refugees are not targeted for exercising their freedom of expression – when Congolese refugees rot in jail for protesting their living conditions – to claiming that LGBT people won’t risk serious harm in Rwanda – when evidence we’ve collected has LGBTI people detained, beaten, insulted and harassed for their sexual identity.” “This report is not grounded in reality. The Rwandan government has an abysmal record when it comes to guaranteeing internationally recognised refugee rights, statues and protocols. It’s difficult to imagine a less genuine assessment of Rwanda’s shocking human rights record,” he said. In another document released on Monday night, the government said it could send notices of intent to those coming to the UK without authorisation that would warn them they could be sent to Rwanda. A draft letter said: “I am writing to inform you about how your protection claim is being managed. We have evidence that before you claimed asylum in the United Kingdom, you were present in or had a connection to [name the safe country or countries]. This may have consequences for whether your claim is admitted to the UK asylum system. “We may also ask Rwanda, another country we consider to be safe, whether it would admit you, under the terms of the migration and economic development partnership between Rwanda and the UK.” Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said letters carrying a threat of Rwanda would prompt many of those waiting for their claims to be processed to disappear and hide from the authorities in the UK. “The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them. “The process it is putting in place lacks compassion and demonstrates an inability to see the face behind the case. It shows how this government simply wants to treat vulnerable people who have fled war and oppression as human cargo to be transported thousands of miles away out of sight and out of mind,” he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “There is no evidence to substantiate these baseless claims. “Illegal migrants, including those who crossed the Channel, may be removed and we have the power to detain people ahead of their removal from the UK. “Only those with inadmissible asylum claims who have made dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys will be relocated and to suggest otherwise is wrong.”",News/UK news,Home Office admits LGBTQI+ refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/home-office-admits-gay-lesbian-refugees-could-be-persecuted-sent-rwanda
5/11/2022,"Uefa will allow two clubs to enter the Champions League from 2024 based on historical performance, it has been agreed, but with the rankings determined by country and not club. The deal, struck at a meeting of Uefa’s executive committee on Tuesday, is a compromise which will also see the number of fixtures in the revamped Champions League reduced to eight matches per club in the ‘league stage’, down from a proposed 10. Under previous plans, two clubs who failed to reach the Champions League by league qualification would have still made the tournament based on their coefficient, a rating determined by performance in Europe over the previous five years. The new approach will also see two places determined by coefficient, but that of the country as a whole, and only over the past year. If the new rules were applied this season, the two extra places would go to clubs from England and the Netherlands. The numbers are based on points obtained by all a country’s clubs in a given season in the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League. In four of the past five seasons – and six of the past 10 – England would have got one of the places. The Conference League has not existed across those periods. A decrease in fixtures is a clearer victory for fan groups and representatives of national league competitions. Under the original plans for reform, there would have been 10 guaranteed matches for each of the 36 clubs in the “Swiss League” system, a total increase of 100 fixtures per season. Under the compromise, the total number of fixtures would increase by 64. Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: “Uefa has clearly shown today that we are fully committed to respecting the fundamental values of sport and to defending the key principle of open competitions, with qualification based on sporting merit, fully in line with the values and solidarity-based European sports model. “Today’s decisions conclude an extensive consultation process during which we listened to the ideas of fans, players, coaches, national associations, clubs and leagues to name but a few, with the aim to find the best solution for the development and success of European football, both domestically and on the international club stage.”",Sport/Football,Champions League: Uefa settles on new coefficient plan for places,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/champions-league-uefa-new-coefficient-plan-for-places-country-success

5/11/2022,"In a dank, disused railway tunnel in West Sussex hangs a brown, furry parcel, the sole known representative of Britain’s rarest mammal. Scientists don’t like to apply emotive adjectives to animals, but if ever there were a lonesome creature, it would be this greater mouse-eared bat. The bat’s reappearance in December for its 20th winter has astounded its guardians, because of the animal’s great age, but also because it was missing, assumed dead, for nearly two years. Since 2002, the bat – the size of a small rabbit, with a wingspan stretching in flight to nearly half a metre – has spent winters clinging to the cool bricks of the tunnel. But it vanished in December 2019 and was missing when members of Sussex Bat Group returned in January and February 2020. Last year, the pandemic prevented a count, so its fate was unknown. “We assumed it had run its course,” says Tony Hutson, a bat expert and retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, who discovered the bat. “But it returned and looked pretty healthy this winter.” Where Britain’s rarest mammal spent the pandemic is just one question among many it poses. Each spring, the bat stirs, flaps slowly down the tunnel and vanishes into green woodlands beyond. It remains unseen until the following winter, when it returns to its hibernation roost. Where did it come from? Why is it here? Why is it alone? And can it be helped? When it was declared extinct in 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis, was the first land mammal to disappear from Britain since the wolf, about 250 years ago. Most bats zigzag through the sky collecting insects, but this species descends earthwards, swooping upon grasshoppers, crickets and dung beetles. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey. There were never many of these bats in Britain. When a colony was discovered in 1957 in the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in Dorset, it caused a sensation. Photos were published in the Times and several animals were prodded out of hibernation to be filmed in TV studios. Disturbing the bats mid‑hibernation probably killed some of them. Others were spirited away by collectors. The species was barely seen again. Hutson is not the original champion of Britain’s greater mouse-eared bats. The first was a tea planter from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) called William Watt Addison Phillips, who retired to Bognor Regis in West Sussex in 1959, shortly after the frenzy in Dorset. While exploring dilapidated tunnels with his grandson, Phillips discovered a small colony of the bats. He proceeded to shoot a couple for donation to the Natural History Museum. When Hutson discovered the bat in 2002, he hoped this young male would lead them to a secret colony. But a media appeal brought no sightings. He scoured chalk mines and disused lime kilns. An attempt to extract DNA from bat hair, to identify the individual’s origins, failed. He considered putting a VHF radio tag on the animal, but feared the imposition could kill it. In 2007, the bat was taken carefully from the wall for a short inspection. It was in good health, but very much alone: its genitals showed it had never been sexually active. In March 2018, I accompanied Hutson into the tunnel to meet Britain’s loneliest bat. It is difficult to bond with anyone who is deeply asleep, head tucked out of sight, but it was a small, tranquil being (and a paler brown than I had imagined). When the Irish playwright Barry McStay read the Guardian article I wrote about the bat, it inspired him to write Vespertilio, a play about Alan, a devoted conservationist guarding a rare bat. The middle-aged bat lover meets a young homeless runaway and the unfolding fiction explores loneliness within the gay community, love, deceit and redemption. The critically acclaimed play opened in London in 2019 in the apposite surroundings of a disused railway tunnel beneath Waterloo station. Later that year, the bat disappeared. Now that it has reappeared, there are calls to solve the riddle of its existence. “When it first turned up, I thought it was a pioneer and there were others around, but now I think it’s just a stray that got over here from the continent somehow and hung on,” says Hutson. The Sussex Bat Group volunteers have done all they can, but Fiona Mathews, a professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, suggests professional conservationists should take action. She is calling on Natural England, the UK government’s adviser for the protection of nature, to investigate whether more greater mouse-eared bats are living undetected in Britain. Genetic identification of bat droppings found in large roof spaces where the species could roost could reveal individuals secreted away – in the roof of a stately home, for instance. “This individual bat is getting quite geriatric now. It’s a fascinating thing, but I keep turning over in my head what could be done. Why aren’t we doing more about this?” says Matthews. In mainland Europe, the species thrives around vineyards, which provide bare ground where it can easily find prey. Perhaps the proliferation of wine-making in Sussex could boost this impossibly uncommon bat in Britain. “Given that we think Britain is going to become more suitable for the species with climate change, why don’t we have a recovery programme for the greater mouse-eared bat?” asks Matthews. “We know this species is losing its range in southern Europe. They will probably need to move north for their survival. They are in northern France, which is not that different and not that far away. Maybe they just need a helping hand across the Channel.” Wild Green Wonders: A Life in Nature by Patrick Barkham is out now (Guardian Faber, £14.99).

5/11/2022,"We know that clingfilm and plastic ziplock bags are environmentally unfriendly, but what are the alternatives? What other storage options are worth investing in?Jane, London N4 “You’ve got to have zero tolerance for everything to do with plastic, whether that’s in the house or what’s coming into the house,” says chef Ollie Hunter, who runs The Wheatsheaf, a sustainable pub in Wiltshire. But when it comes to eco-friendly replacements, it’s worth remembering that new isn’t always better: “I’m a purist,” says Hunter. “Let’s just reuse what we’ve already taken out of the planet.” He suggests getting into “the mindset of a bowl and a plate” – simple, yes, but achievable and affordable. This is also a favoured storage tactic of Anshu Ahuja and Renée Williams, co-founders of DabbaDrop in London, a vegan curry takeaway that delivers by bike in eco-packaging. “If it’s a lemon, for example, just put it [or an onion, red cabbage, tomato … you get the drift] sliced side down on a plate, and voilà! No bag or clingfilm needed.” If you’re storing something “wetter, crumbly, or a mixture” instead, use a deep bowl covered by a plate. “And if you need to wrap lettuce, just use a clean tea towel.” A tea towel can, of course, also be used when proving dough, and a damp one for wrapping things like pastry. Bowl covers (those things that look like shower caps) are another way to avoid clingfilm – just make sure they’re made of linen, Hunter says, because “it’s less water-intensive and easier to grow than cotton, and it does seem to be better, as long as you like the crinkled look”. Hunter is, however, “a big negative” when it comes to those reusable beeswax wraps. “Bees need to be left alone,” he insists. Soy wax versions are another option: “Plants and vegetables create better soil structure, more biodiversity, more oxygen in the planet. Bees aren’t going to be doing that.” Likewise, silicone – be it bags or boxes for the fridge and freezer or baking sheets – is better than plastic, Hunter says, but is “a harder thing to get back to its natural state”. Bamboo and wood are also good choices, as is metal, for fridge and freezer, and for Ahuja and Williams’ beloved dabbas. “They’re made from food-grade stainless steel and can carry lunch or store leftovers in separate compartments.” You can pop them in the fridge or oven, and they’re good for picnics, too – “We don’t use anything else.” Jars, meanwhile, are of course good for storing everything from dressings to grains, and come with the bonus of looking good, too. But, says Jake Leach, head chef at The Harwood Arms, the only Michelin-starred pub in London, use only whatever you have to hand. “There’s always takeaway boxes, butter tubs, bottles … most things can be reused.” Essentially, don’t buy it if you don’t need it. “We need to preserve, conserve and protect,” Hunter says.

5/11/2022,"Sri Lankan troops have conducted a dramatic pre-dawn operation to rescue Mahinda Rajapaksa – who resigned as prime minister on Monday – firing warning shots in the air to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters who had stormed his official residence in Colombo. Five people were killed and nearly 200 wounded on Monday in the worst violence in weeks of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis. Demonstrations continued on Tuesday as hundreds of anti-government protesters defied a nationwide curfew, gathering in the streets of Colombo and shouting slogans outside the office of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is the president’s brother, had reluctantly stepped down in a bid to placate the protesters who have accused the government of mishandling the economy and bankrupting the country, but his resignation did little to calm public anger. Late on Monday night, protesters tried forced their way into Temple Tree, the prime minister’s official residence, and attempted to storm the main two-storey building where Mahinda Rajapaksa was holed up with his family. “After a pre-dawn operation, the former PM and his family were evacuated to safety by the army,” said a security official. “At least 10 petrol bombs were thrown into the compound.” Mahinda Rajapaksa’s removal to an undisclosed location followed a day of violent protests, with the homes of more than 40 pro-Rajapaksa politicians set on fire. Burned out cars and buses littered the streets of Colombo on Tuesday. On Tuesday police kept up a barrage of teargas and fired warning shots in the air to hold back protesters at all three entrances to Temple Trees, where anti-government demonstrations have been taking place for weeks. The president declared a state of emergency over the weekend, giving sweeping powers of arrest to the military, as protests demanding his resignation escalated. Protesters and Sri Lankan religious leaders have blamed Rajapaksa supporters for turning the protests, which had been largely peaceful, into scenes of violence, sparking retaliatory attacks. Pro-Rajapaksa supporters, many bussed in from outside the city and armed with iron rods and sticks, violently attacked an anti-government protest site in Colombo on Monday, leaving almost 200 people injured. In two other separate incidents, politicians from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters, killing three people and injuring at least five. Protesters gathered around the airports and set up checkpoints to make sure that none of the politicians from the ruling party attempted to flee Sri Lanka. Namal Rajapaksa, a son of the resigned prime minister, said the family had no intention of leaving. Gotabaya Rajapaksa urged people to “remain calm and stop violence and acts of revenge against citizens, irrespective of political affiliations”. “All efforts will be made to restore political stability through consensus, within constitutional mandate and to resolve economic crisis,” said the president in a tweet. The UN condemned the violence, with its high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, calling on the authorities to prevent further unrest. “I am deeply troubled by the escalation of violence in Sri Lanka after supporters of the prime minister attacked peaceful protesters in Colombo yesterday, 9 May, and the subsequent mob violence against members of the ruling party,” Bachelet said on Tuesday. Sri Lanka’s deepening economic crisis is the worst since independence in 1948, with its foreign reserves falling to record laws. The government has been unable to afford to import food, fuel and medicines, leading to shortages of essentials, lengthy power cuts and fears of starvation. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka’s powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office, accusing them of financial impropriety and corruption, but Gotabaya Rajapaksa has repeatedly said he will not resign as president. His brother’s resignation appeared to be an attempt to appease protesters, but the scenes in Colombo on Tuesday made it clear that many would not be satisfied until Gotabaya had also stepped down. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has challenged their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from people who had previously supported their brand of nationalist politics, which pandered to the Sinhalese Buddhist majority. With Mahinda Rajapaksa no longer prime minister, Sri Lanka’s government has been dissolved. While the president has declared he intends to form a “unity cabinet” with members of all political parties, the main opposition party stated that it would not help form a government until the president stepped down.",News/World news,Sri Lanka troops rescue ex-PM as houses torched in deadly night of unrest ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/troops-rescue-outgoing-sri-lanka-pm-as-houses-torched-in-deadly-night-of-unrest
5/11/2022,"We heard about the Avatar 2 trailer long before we saw it. Last month, the Hollywood Reporter found itself lumbered with the unenviable task of describing footage of Avatar: The Way of Water that was shown to theatrical exhibitors during CinemaCon. And, judging by the write-up, it was a spectacle of such awe-inspiring immensity that it could only ever realistically be rivalled by the second coming of Christ. Variety wrote breathlessly: “Exhibitors were immersed into different regions across the dazzling world of Pandora through sweeping visuals of the planet’s crystal blue oceans and lakes.” Forbes, meanwhile, was so blown away by the non-stop 3D extravaganza that it claimed Avatar had “won” CinemaCon. The message from anyone who saw the trailer was clear: Avatar is back, and ready to knock your socks off all over again. Well, luckily for us the Avatar 2 trailer went online yesterday, giving us lowly non-exhibitors a chance to have our brains splattered out of the back of our skulls as well. And, upon watching it, there’s a good chance that we all had the same thought at the same time. Wait, are we watching the thing that they watched? Because the trailer that dropped on YouTube really isn’t particularly spectacular. Some Na’vi jump across a tree. A sort of lizardy bird thing flies across some water. Some characters go for a bit of a swim. Sam Worthington’s character looks like he’s doing his best to hold in a fart. And, apart from the soundtrack – which is effectively the sound of Enya passing out from boredom and landing on a synthesiser – that’s about it. Look, Avatar happened a long time ago. And, even though its cultural cachet has long since been eroded by the deathless onslaught of superhero movies, people loved it at the time. They got to go to the cinema and wear a special pair of glasses and be blown away by all the best visuals that 2009 could muster. I saw Avatar at the cinema twice, for example. However, can I remember a single thing about it? Not really. There were blue people, and something called unobtanium, and an angry man ripping off the final act of Aliens as hard as he could, but that’s about it. If James Cameron is serious about making a long-dormant franchise like Avatar a going concern again – and he is, as his endless convoy of planned sequels will attest – then this trailer seems a bit like a misstep. There isn’t a trace of premise here, or character, or any real action to speak of. Instead, we’re given a minute and a half of nice-looking scenery. It’s like being held hostage to look at someone’s holiday photos. Now, there is a chance that my viewing conditions aren’t exactly ideal. Avatar has always been about watching something beautiful on a giant screen, through special glasses that make you feel completely immersed. This is how the CinemaCon attendees got to see the trailer, and perhaps that explains their awestruck reactions. Meanwhile, I watched it on a four-inch YouTube window at my desk on a sunny day while eating an apple. The conditions couldn’t be more mundane, and you suspect that James Cameron would melt like an Indiana Jones baddie if he ever caught anyone sullying his work like that. But this is how nine million people, and counting, have experienced the trailer. Far, far more people have watched it on laptops, or phones, or smartwatches for crying out loud, than in cinemas. And that will also extend to the film itself. For everyone who will pay to see Avatar 2 at the cinema like Cameron intended, scores more will wait for it to turn up for free on Disney+. And if the best thing that the film has going for it is lovely scenery that can only be properly appreciated through 3D glasses, that might be a problem. But it’s still early days. In truth, the Avatar 2 trailer felt less like a trailer and more like a tech demo. We still have months before the film is released. Maybe in the next trailer, stuff could actually happen. Wouldn’t that be novel?",Arts/Film,Avatar 2 trailer: prepare to be swept away by boredom,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/10/avatar-2-trailer-avatar-the-way-of-water-james-cameron-sequel
5/11/2022,"The former England cricketer and coach Graham Thorpe is seriously ill in hospital, according to a statement issued by the Professional Cricketers’ Association at the request of his family, with his prognosis described as “unclear at this stage”. “Graham Thorpe has recently fallen seriously ill and is currently in hospital receiving treatment,” the statement read. “His prognosis is unclear at this stage and we ask for privacy for him and his family at this time. Our thoughts are with Graham and his family.” The 52-year-old, a left-handed batter who became one of the finest English players of his generation, played precisely 100 Tests and 82 one-day internationals during a 12-year international career, before retiring in 2005. He played a further 189 first-class matches for Surrey and in all scored 49 first-class centuries and averaged 45.04. “The thoughts of everyone at the club are with Graham, his wife Amanda, and family at this time,” his former county said in a statement. “He is an icon of the English game, known by millions of cricket fans and forever a favourite son of Surrey CCC.” After the end of his playing career Thorpe moved into coaching, starting in Australia where he worked with the likes of Steve Smith and David Warner at New South Wales, before joining England, initially as a batting coach. He had most recently been assistant coach on last winter’s catastrophic Ashes tour, which ended in a 4-0 defeat.

5/11/2022,"The head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has warned that the civilian death toll in Ukraine may be thousands higher than the official toll of 3,381, with deaths in the port city of Mariupol alone likely to add significantly to the total. “We have been working on estimates, but all I can say for now is that it is thousands higher than the numbers we have currently given to you,” Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, told a press briefing in Geneva, when asked about the total number of deaths and injuries. “The big black hole is really Mariupol, where it has been difficult for us to fully access and to get fully corroborated information,” she said. The warning was delivered as dozens more bodies were discovered in the ruins of a burnt out and collapsed five-storey building in Izium in the Kharkiv region, and as the UN migration agency said 8 million people were internally displaced inside Ukraine by the conflict. “This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!” Oleh Synehubov, the head of Kharkiv’s regional administration, said in a social media message announcing the deaths. As both Ukrainian and Russian military officials claimed advances in the battles for the country’s south and east, dominated by a 300-mile-long frontline, the latest phase of the campaign appeared to have settled for now into a grim back and forth struggle over shell smashed villages and small towns. In the Kharkiv area in particular, the conflict has turned into a long-range shelling war between the two sides. After unexpectedly fierce resistance forced the Kremlin to abandon its effort to storm Kyiv more than a month ago, Moscow’s forces have concentrated on capturing the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial region. Further west, Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles, after Russia marked its biggest patriotic holiday without giving new information about the war. One person was killed and five were wounded, the military said. As part of the barrage, a Russian supersonic bomber fired three hypersonic missiles, according to the Center for Defence Strategies, a Ukrainian thinktank tracking the war. The centre identified the weapons used as Kinzhal – or “Dagger” – hypersonic air-to-surface missiles although there was no independent verification of what missiles were used. The strikes on Odesa come amid warnings from the Ukrainian military’s general staff of an elevated missile threat across the country, including claims Russia has increased the number of naval missile carriers operating in the Black Sea. With the conflict on both sides being defined by intense Russian shelling by artillery and rocket systems, CNN quoted an unnamed defence official on Monday saying the Ukraine military had received 85 of 90 M777 long-range field howitzers promised by the US, along with 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition out of 184,000 promised. The defence official said the US military in Europe completed the training of 310 Ukrainian service personnel in handling howitzers with a further 50 undergoing training. In Mariupol itself, fierce fighting was continuing around the area of the Azovstal steel mill where about 2,000 Ukrainian defenders are still holding out. Despite claims that all civilians who had been sheltering there had been evacuated, it was claimed on Tuesday about 100 were still inside the sprawling plant. One of the Ukrainian fighters holding out at the steel plant said they were still defending the city. Valeri Paditel, who heads the border guards in the Donetsk region, said the fighters were “doing everything to make those who defend the city in the future proud”. While assessments by western defence and intelligence officials, as well as military analysts have focused on the shortcomings of the Russian operation and the heavy losses of men and equipment sustained, there was little evidence of an end in sight for Moscow’s campaign. “Without concrete steps to build a new force, Russia can’t fight a long war, and the clock starts ticking on the failure of their army in Ukraine,” said Phillips P O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews. Russia has about 97 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, largely in the east and the south, a slight increase over last week, according to a senior US. A further 19 BTGs are reported to be just across the Russian border near the city of Belgorod.",News/World news,"Ukraine civilian deaths may be thousands higher than official toll, warns UN",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/ukraine-civilian-deaths-higher-official-toll-un-warns
5/11/2022,"The state opening of parliament is a reminder that much of what passes for a British constitution is actually fancy dress. The doors to the Commons are ritually closed on Black Rod, the royal emissary, as a reminder that monarchs have not been allowed in the chamber since 1642, when King Charles I burst in to demand the arrest of rebellious members. Civil war followed. Fast-forward 380 years and we find another Charles on the golden throne of the House of Lords – sitting in for his elderly mother – dictating parliament’s agenda from a goatskin parchment. The speech is written in Downing Street, where a prime minister in command of a large Commons majority enjoys powers not much diluted down from monarchy. There are two forces determining how Boris Johnson uses that power. Both are informal and temperamental. First, he is afraid to upset ideological sensibilities on the right of his party, where a taste for rebellion is always quick to turn regicidal. Second, he takes no interest in the managerial side of government – the business of getting things done – which he finds boring. As for restraint on abuses of power, the conventional mechanism is conscience. There are invisible lines that a prime minister is expected not to cross as a point of honour, guided by natural deference to democracy. It is well-established now that those qualities are absent in Johnson. Taken in combination, those factors produce a legislative agenda that is not really about governing at all but sending signals, framing debates and skewing the pitch on which the prime minister intends one day to campaign for re-election. The volume of bills being proposed, 38 in all, testifies to a lack of focus and purpose. In the absence of one big plan, there are many little plans to look busy. None of it comes close to getting a grip on the single biggest issue facing most people in the country: the shrivelling of their incomes as prices rise against a backdrop of impending recession. The Johnson flagship policy for the general betterment of life in the UK will be enacted as a “levelling up and regeneration bill”. Its advertised benefits are formidable. A government briefing note promises, among other treats, to “improve productivity, boost economic growth, encourage innovation, create good jobs and enhance educational attainment”. Scroll down to find the method, and it turns out that Shangri-la is reached by way of measures no less drastic than “giving residents more of a say over changing street names and ensuring everyone can continue to benefit from alfresco dining”. There will also be a new duty on the government to set “levelling up missions” and report on whether they have been accomplished. The law to make everything better for everyone will work by placing a statutory obligation on the government to explain how things are getting better. Johnson is reduced to these inanities because the most powerful faction among his MPs will not, as a point of ideological principle, countenance anything that seriously interferes with the accrual of wealth and privilege to those who already have them. Levelling up has hit the same obstacle that derailed David Cameron’s “big society” agenda. That too was conceived as a way to rehabilitate unhappy parts of the country without recourse to any of the explicit financial redistribution that Thatcherite Tories despise as socialism. Johnson, like Cameron before him, has wasted time on delusions of political alchemy, trying to cook up egalitarian ends with libertarian means. The product will always disappoint. The next stage is also predictable. Someone will have to be blamed for the persistence of material discomfort, and the political subject will have to be steered away from the economy. That leaves Johnson committed to a programme of government by campaign gesture and culture war provocation. Downing Street has laws for both. One item, long anticipated on the Tory benches, will be a “bill of rights”, the purpose of which is to assert British national autonomy in matters of human rights law, in much the same spirit that Brexit was imagined as a heroic economic emancipation. In place of legal obligation to principles enshrined in international treaty, enforceable by courts, there will be a restoration of “common sense”, as defined by ministers. In Orwellian fashion, this is cast as a measure to “ensure the constitution is defended”; from what that defence is needed is unclear. The implied enemy is quisling remainer judges, always getting their wigs in a twist over government breaking the rules, and lefty human rights lawyers, one of whom happens to be leader of the Labour party. In the same spirit, there will be a public order bill, banning direct action protests – climate activists chaining themselves to railings, gluing themselves to motorways – that cause a nuisance but hardly threaten to unravel society. Police will be given powers to stop anyone who even looks as if they might be up to anti-government mischief. As with immigration policy, Downing Street is convinced that public opinion on law and order permits strides to the authoritarian right well beyond the boundaries of conventional Westminster consensus. The rule of thumb: if liberals are squealing in distress, double down; press harder. It seems a long time ago that moderate Tory MPs were endorsing Johnson for the leadership in the belief that his true colours were the ones he had displayed to win election as mayor of London. They thought that the cosmopolitan incarnation of “Boris” would re-emerge once Brexit was done. Johnson himself promised them as much in private têtes-à-têtes, although they should have known he was promising the opposite to Eurosceptic headbangers in a room next door. It was clear then that Johnson would say anything to become prime minister and, once that goal was achieved, do anything with the power at his disposal to carry on being prime minister. That is all there is and all there ever was. That is the agenda that Prince Charles declared from his mother’s throne, albeit encrypted in parliamentary pageant. And this is all that will be left once the crowns, robes and rods have been packed safely back in the constitutional dressing-up box: 38 bills adding up to a campaign for the deferral of serious government and the prolongation of rule by Johnson for Johnson’s sake.

5/11/2022,"The chief executive of Stellantis, one of the world’s biggest carmakers, has warned battery shortages could affect the industry as soon as 2025 as the transition towards electric vehicles accelerates. Carlos Tavares, the Stellantis chief executive, said that current plans for battery production may not address the demand from carmakers as they ramp up electric car sales in the coming years, even with significant new investments in European “gigafactory” battery plants and suppliers already at scale in China, South Korea and Japan. The car industry has struggled with persistent shortages of computer chips since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, preventing it from making a full recovery. Despite strong demand in many big markets, shortages of crucial parts have meant the industry has lost out on billions of pounds in sales. Tavares warned that battery supply could be the next bottleneck facing the industry, just as carmakers around the world try to accelerate production of electric vehicles. Stellantis, which owns brands including Peugeot, Vauxhall, Fiat, Chrysler and Jeep after a merger last year, is aiming to sell only battery EVs in Europe by 2030. “I can anticipate that we will have around 2025, 2026, a short supply of batteries, and if there is no short supply of batteries then there will be a significant dependence of the western world vis-a-vis Asia,” he said, speaking on Tuesday at a car industry conference run by the Financial Times. “That’s something that we can easily anticipate. “The speed at which everybody is building manufacturing capacity for batteries is possibly on the edge to be able to support the fast-changing markets in which we are operating.” Stellantis and its predecessor Peugeot under Tavares were among the more cautious large-scale carmakers in embracing electric technology. Tavares has repeatedly warned of problems in the transition away from polluting fossil fuel vehicles. Last year he said the UK government had risked the future of Vauxhall’s factory in Ellesmere Port with a “brutal” ban on sales of pure internal combustion engines after 2030, although Stellantis later decided to invest £100m to upgrade production, to the relief of the UK car industry. Tavares also warned that the shift to electric production could create “geopolitical risks” because of dependence on minerals mined in countries seen as strategic rivals. “We may not like the way that those materials are going to be sourced in a few years,” he said.",News/Business,"Electric car battery shortage looms in 2025, warns Stellantis boss",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/electric-car-battery-shortage-looms-in-2025-warns-stellantis-boss
5/11/2022,"Unprecedented shortages of food and fuel along with record inflation and blackouts have inflicted widespread misery in Sri Lanka’s most painful downturn since independence from Britain in 1948. Anger over the economic crisis and the government’s handling of the situation has led to weeks of unrest and calls for the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, to step down from power. On Monday, his brother, the prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, resigned and parliament was dissolved as political turmoil intensified and the ruling party further lost its grip on power. Since March, demonstrations have spread across the country of 22 million people as people began to feel the bite of the economic crisis and blamed the government for mishandling the economy and overseeing rampant corruption which has pushed Sri Lanka to the brink of bankruptcy. Many initially took to the streets despite emergency laws that made demonstrations illegal and gave the government sweeping powers. Over the weekend, the president reinstated the state of emergency he had repealed a few weeks before. Thousands of people have been protesting on a daily basis, particularly in Colombo, where a vast protest camp was set up outside the office of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, widely known as Gota. Crowds gathered every day calling for him to resign, with “Gota Go Home” the clarion call of the demonstrations. Many of the protests have been peaceful, with Catholic clergy and nuns leading a procession in the capital. However, there was the first death of a protester in April, when police in the small town of Rambukkana, 50 miles outside Colombo, fired on a crowd demonstrating against rising fuel prices. On 9 May, protests in Colombo turned violent when pro-government supporters attacked demonstrators with iron bars and wooden rods and police responded with teargas and water cannon, leaving almost 200 people injured. Two ruling-party MPs were accused of shooting at anti-government protesters in different part of the country. In retaliation, houses and vehicles of several pro-Rajapaksa politicians and the residence of Mahinda Rajapaksa were set on fire. The unrest and dissatisfaction with the government led to Sri Lanka’s entire cabinet apart from the president and, initially, the prime minister, resigning from their posts this week. Rajapaksa sought to form a unity government as public unrest surged over the ruling family’s handling of the economy. His once-powerful coalition is in turmoil after a string of defections, capped by the new finance minister’s resignation just one day after taking office. President Rajapaksa revoked a state of emergency late on 10 May after dozens of lawmakers walked out of the ruling coalition, leaving his government in a minority in parliament. The move was aimed at avoiding a vote on the extraordinary laws in parliament where the government is five short of the 113 seats required for a simple majority. Politically, the possible next steps could include the appointment of a new prime minister to replace the president’s elder brother, Mahinda, or snap parliamentary elections way ahead of a scheduled vote in 2025. Although the government is now in a minority, there has been no clear signal that opposition legislators will attempt a no-confidence motion to topple it immediately. However, opposition parties have already rebuffed the president’s call to join a unity administration led by him and his brother. Nimal Lanza, a former minister who has also abandoned Rajapaksa’s administration, conceded that the ruling party no longer had a mandate to govern. “I beg and appeal to you to take the side of the protesters,” he told parliament, addressing the prime minister, who attended the session but remained silent. A critical lack of foreign currency has left Sri Lanka struggling to service its ballooning $51bn foreign debt, with the pandemic torpedoing vital revenue from tourism and remittances. There have been unprecedented shortages as a result, with no sign of an end to the economic woes. Economists say Sri Lanka’s crisis has been exacerbated by government mismanagement, years of accumulated borrowing and ill-advised tax cuts. The foreign exchange shortage forced the government to announce the closure of three of its diplomatic missions in Norway, Iraq and Australia. Three others, in Nigeria, Germany and Cyprus, were shut in January. A doctors’ body told the government there was an acute shortage of medicines that could collapse the health system. “Failure to assure a continuous and adequate supply of essential medical drugs will lead to collapse of the entire health system,” it told the health ministry in a letter. “This will create a life-threatening situation to our citizens, who are already facing an unprecedented crisis situation,” the Government Medical Officers Association said. During the protests in the capital, more than 60 people have been arrested and many have said they were tortured in police custody. The UN Human Rights Council said it was closely watching the deteriorating situation in Sri Lanka, which is already facing international censure over its human rights record. “The drift towards militarisation and the weakening of institutional checks and balances in Sri Lanka have affected the state’s ability to effectively tackle the economic crisis,” the UNHRC said.",News/World news,Why are people protesting in Sri Lanka?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/why-are-people-protesting-in-sri-lanka
5/11/2022,"The Queen’s speech, which set out the government’s legislative agenda for the next parliamentary year, was a mix of new plans, long-made pledges and a handful of held-over bills. Here is what it set out – and what it all means, politically. What is planned: There are six proposed bills intended to make the UK more competitive or otherwise free and liberal in the wake of Brexit, or tailored to post-Brexit trade deals. The flagship is the Brexit freedoms bill, which allows EU rules to be easily removed. Also planned are the procurement bill, financial services and markets bill, data reform bill, genetic technology (precision breeding) bill and trade (Australia and New Zealand) bill. Why it’s there: In part this is the sheer logistical necessity of changing regulations in the aftermath of Brexit. But the Brexit freedoms bill in particular is intended to remind voters that Boris Johnson got departure from the EU over the line, seen by the Conservatives as a key success. What is planned: There are seven bills arguably aimed, in part or whole, at stirring up the Tory base, creating headlines in friendly papers and annoying opponents. A public order bill will specifically target disruptive environmental protesters; a media bill will allow Channel 4 to be privatised; public bodies will not be allowed to boycott certain countries. Arguably the key bill would replace the Human Rights Act with a UK bill of rights. The higher education (freedom of speech) bill makes a return from the last parliament. The levelling-up bill promises local people “more of a say over changing street names”. Finally, the conversion therapy bill will ban practices aimed at changing sexuality, but not gender identity. Why it’s there: This is all part of a wider No 10-led strategy to focus on such divisive issues in the hope of shoring up support among socially conservative voters. Whether there are enough of these to win another election, if more liberal Britons become alienated, remains to be seen. What is planned: Two things: a bill setting out Downing Street’s energy security policy, and the much-touted bill to put into law the strategy for levelling up. The latter is described in fairly broad terms, with commitments including the pledge for more devolution in England and, perhaps more appealing to some voters, giving local people powers to shape planning decisions. Why it’s there: The planning element is fairly clearly aimed at wooing disillusioned Tory voters, especially in the south of England. Elsewhere, it is more of a question, some might argue, of why there is not more focus on the cost of living, even if in part this is because this is an issue which concerns day-to-day policy rather than legislation. What is planned: In legislative terms, only one thing: creating a UK infrastructure bank to “support regional and local economic growth and deliver net zero”. Why it’s there: As with the cost of living, critics might point to the lack of much else. The 140-page Queen’s speech briefing document has brief mentions of the climate emergency in terms of foreign aid, but that is otherwise it. The only mention of “insulate” is a promise to jail Insulate Britain protesters. What is planned: A higher education bill and a schools bill, setting out loans for post-18 education and a funding settlement for English schools. Why it’s there: Education is a perennial feature of Queen’s speeches. The schools funding settlement has been contentious for some time, and could bring debate. What is planned: Once again, given the housing crisis, it is a case, perhaps, of what is not said. There are planned bills to create a regulator of social housing, and a renters’ reform bill to abolish “no fault” evictions. More significant are the “blue wall”-friendly measures to allow more local input into planning. Why it’s there: There appears no consensus in government about how to build more homes, so improving the lot of renters at least does something. And planning has been a political minefield for many years. What is planned: Yet another permanent fixture of the Queen’s speech. A fair bit of the four bills this time relate to the post-Ukraine invasion world, including a national security bill bringing in “new civil measures to use as a tool of last resort where prosecution of a hostile actor is not possible”. Other bills will seek to better protect victims, and create new security rules over potential terror attacks. Why it’s there: Much of this is legislative tidying up; the flagship crime-based bill is the public order bill, seeking to further restrict protest. Critics will note there is nothing aimed at easing the backlog of cases in the judicial system. What is planned: A mixed bag of more than a dozen bills taking in areas including transport, including a plan for Great British Railways to simplify the privatised rail system and a law specifically aimed at P&O Ferries, mandating minimum employment standards for seafarers. Two bills concern Northern Ireland, and others are even more specific, such as the planned electronic trade documents bill, which puts electronic documents on the same legal basis as their paper equivalents. Why it’s there: It depends on the bill. Some, such as the rail bill, are the hobby horse of a particular minister (in this case Grant Shapps). Others simply adapt legislation for a changing world. A few, such as a bill on modern slavery and people trafficking, have been discussed and delayed for some years.",News/Politics,The Queen’s speech 2022: what was in it and what it means,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/the-queens-speech-2022-what-was-in-it-and-what-it-means
5/11/2022,"Dentists have warned that tens of thousands of children have been left in pain for more than a year, as new figures reveal the number of tooth extractions for children in hospital in England more than halved during the pandemic. The number of extractions performed on decayed teeth in children aged 19 and under decreased from 35,190 in 2019-20 to 14,615 in 2020-21, data from the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities shows. The British Dental Association (BDA) said the fall in procedures, which take place in hospital under general anaesthetic, did not reflect any change in demand. Charlotte Waite, the chair of the BDA’s England community dental services committee, said: “Tooth extractions among children have collapsed, but the level of demand hasn’t gone anywhere. Covid has simply left tens of thousands in pain, potentially waiting years for treatment they desperately need. “Government has yet to offer real clarity on the scale of the backlog, or a credible plan to tackle it.” The figures show that the proportion of extractions as a result of decay are virtually unchanged on levels seen a decade ago. The data also shows that children from the poorest areas are three times more likely to have extractions than those from the most affluent communities. More than 12.5m NHS dental appointments for children had been lost in England since lockdown, the BDA said, while tooth extractions had been the No 1 reason for hospital admissions among young children for a generation. The BDA said full disclosure was required on waiting times for hospital tooth-extraction procedures, adding that “tens of thousands of children will be left in pain, facing difficulties learning, eating and sleeping for over a year”. NHS England has previously said there are significant gaps in official data, owing to wide-ranging coding and reporting issues. An NHS report on hospital dentistry published in February 2021 stated: “We found gaps and anomalies in the collection of data through hospital episode statistics, which limits our understanding of both patient need and the people doing the work, which, in turn, affects our ability to measure outcomes, assure quality and plan the workforce we need.” The BDA joined sector leaders and the learning disability charity Mencap early in the pandemic in pressing the then health secretary, Matt Hancock, to develop an urgent action plan and commission a review into the true scale of extractions under general anaesthetic. No plan had been delivered to date, the BDA said. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “We have provided £50m to fund up to 350,000 extra NHS dental appointments and we are growing the workforce so people can get the care they need. “Dentists prioritised vulnerable groups and urgent care throughout the pandemic while continuing to provide free care to groups such as pregnant women, young people and those on low-income benefits. “We are committed to levelling up dental health across the country and through our Health and Care Act, we will make it simpler to add fluoride to water in more areas.” The Guardian has revealed that many patients in south-west England are being left in dental pain because they are unable to register for NHS care, with some so desperate they are resorting to DIY treatment. The charity Healthwatch in Somerset has reported that it is almost impossible for a new patient to register for an NHS dentist in the county, which is leading to adults and children living in agony, self-treating, or travelling out of the area for help.",News/Society,Hospital tooth extractions for children in England fall by over half in pandemic,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/10/hospital-tooth-extractions-children-england-nhs-dental-operations
