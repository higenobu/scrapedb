4/5/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Germany will temporarily take control of a unit of Gazprom PJSC in the country as it seeks to safeguard security of gas supply.

Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy to Address UN Security Council Tuesday Gazprom Germania GmbH -- owner of energy supplier Wingas GmbH and a gas storage firm -- will come under the trusteeship of the German energy regulator until Sept. 30, Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters in Berlin. That means the Federal Network Agency will assume the role of a shareholder and can take all necessary measures to ensure security of supply, he said. The government won’t ultimately take ownership of the company. Gazprom subsidiaries in Europe are coming under pressure as clients and business partners refuse to do business with them, raising the prospect that some won’t survive. Gazprom Germania’s Astora unit operates Germany’s biggest gas storage facility in the northern town of Rehden in the state of Lower Saxony. The site is considered key to Germany’s energy security. “The federal government is doing what is necessary to ensure security of supply in Germany,” Habeck said in a statement on Monday. “This also means that we do not allow energy infrastructures in Germany to be subject to arbitrary decisions by the Kremlin.” Gazprom said on Friday it no longer owned its German subsidiary, which also has a trading arm in the U.K. and units from Switzerland to Singapore. The Russian gas giant didn’t disclose the new ownership, but regulatory filings showed the transaction involved exiting Gazprom Export Business Services LLC, the owner of Gazprom Germania. In turn, a company called Joint Stock Company Palmary became a shareholder of Gazprom Export Business Services LLC. It isn’t clear who the ultimate beneficial owner of Palmary is: it was registered in October at a Moscow address, and since March 30 its general director was Dmitry Tseplyaev, according to the Russian business register. Habeck said the Russian gas giant exited the German subsidiary without seeking government approval, violating German foreign trade law. It’s unclear what happens after Sept. 30, and what implications that will have for Gazprom Germania’s subsidiaries from the U.K. to Singapore. The German unit also owns a London-based trading arm and Gazprom Energy, a retail provider that the U.K. government plans to nationalize in the event it fails.

4/5/2022,"Hertz (HTZ) is turning up the wattage on its push to have a mostly electric rental car fleet. The company said Monday it will purchase 65,000 electric vehicles from upstart Tesla rival Polestar. Mostly consisting of the sporty Polestar 2 sedan, the purchases will occur over five years. Availability is slated to begin in the spring in Europe and later this year in North America and Australia. “Today’s partnership with Polestar further builds on our ambition to become a leading participant in the modern mobility ecosystem and doing so as an environmentally-forward company. By working with EV industry leaders like Polestar, we can help accelerate the adoption of electrification while providing renters, corporate customers and rideshare partners a premium EV product, exceptional experience and lower carbon footprint,"" Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr said. The Polestar deal comes hot on the heels of one inked late last year with Tesla. Hertz said in October it had ordered 100,000 Tesla Model 3s, expected to be delivered late in 2022. The company is anticipating renting out 50,000 of those cars to Uber to support its network. ""So we are starting a great relationship with Tesla. We are also ready to partner with many other manufacturers to extend our lead in the adoptions of electric vehicles,"" former Hertz interim CEO Mark Fields said on Yahoo Finance Live in November. The EV focus by Hertz will be crucial to keeping investors engaged in its turnaround story under new CEO Scherr, who started on Feb. 28 after spending decades at Goldman Sachs in top executive positions. Hertz returned to public markets in early November following a much publicized bankruptcy, after raising $1.3 billion in IPO. Hertz sold 44.52 million shares at $29 each. It had expected to sell 37.1 million shares in a range of $25 to $29, per its prospectus. The pricing valued Hertz — which exited a high-profile bankruptcy in June — at $13.7 billion. Shares are currently trading around $21, giving it a market cap of more than $9 billion. To be sure, the deal is another win for Polestar, which is in the process of merging with a SPAC dubbed Gores Guggenheim. Polestar is expected to debut on public markets in the second quarter of 2022. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.
