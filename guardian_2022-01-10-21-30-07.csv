1/10/2022,"Higher US inflation could lead to a tougher than expected response from America’s central bank that would send tremors through financial markets and put vulnerable countries at risk, the International Monetary Fund has warned. Adding to growing concerns about the sharp increase in price pressures being registered across the globe, the IMF said emerging market nations should brace themselves for muscular action from the US central bank, the Federal Reserve.  “For most of last year, investors priced in a temporary rise in inflation in the US given the unsteady economic recovery and a slow unravelling of supply bottlenecks,” the Washington-based IMF said in a blogpost. “Now sentiment has shifted. Prices are rising at the fastest pace in almost four decades and the tight labour market has started to feed into wage increases. The new Omicron variant has raised additional concerns of supply-side pressures on inflation. The Federal Reserve referred to inflation developments as a key factor in its decision last month to accelerate the tapering of asset purchases.” With the headline measure of inflation above 6% and at its highest level in almost four decades, financial markets believe the Fed will raise interest rates four times in 2022 and also sell bonds in a process known as quantitative tightening. Higher US borrowing costs would normally lead to a stronger dollar, making it more expensive for emerging market countries that have borrowed heavily in the currency to service their debts. Slower US growth prompted by higher interest rates would also affect exports to the world’s biggest economy. The IMF said it anticipated falling US inflation later in the year, but stressed the possibility that broad-based wage rises or sustained supply bottlenecks could lead to higher prices and fuel expectations for further upward pressure on the cost of living. “Faster Fed rate increases in response could rattle financial markets and tighten financial conditions globally“,” the IMF said. “These developments could come with a slowing of US demand and trade and may lead to capital outflows and currency depreciation in emerging markets.” The prospect of higher US interest rates has led to share prices falling since the start of 2022. Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said: “To be fair the Fed were starting to catch up with reality late last year but Omicron meant that the market was reluctant to read their more hawkish move as entirely realistic, given the risks that the variant presented. “However the holiday season provided more evidence that Omicron was notably milder, especially among the vaccinated, and the result has been that the market has looked through this more than they were willing to before Christmas while at the same time the Fed have become even more hawkish by upping the ante on quantitative tightening. So a perfect storm.”",News/Business,"US interest rate rise could hit vulnerable countries, IMF warns ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/10/us-interest-rate-rise-could-hit-vulnerable-countries-imf-warns
1/10/2022,"In a street market in China, factory recruiters with loudspeakers compete for the attention of job seekers, yelling like they’re selling vegetables: “Seating working available!” “Air conditioning!” Others list restrictions: “No tattoos. No hair dye.” One advertises a salary: $2.99 (£2.21) an hour. Outside the market, inspirational slogans are plastered across billboards extolling the Chinese dream. “Work hard and all your dreams will come true.” When you’re paid $2.99, that’s a lot of hard work.  So begins this brilliant documentary by Chinese-American director Jessica Kingdon, which slyly observes China’s transition from the world’s factory to a massive consumer society. It’s a film in the tradition of Koyaanisqatsi or Nikolaus Geyrhalter’s Our Daily Bread. Shot in more than 50 locations in China, it splits more or less into three sections: factory workers, China’s growing middle class and the filthy-rich elite. There’s no voiceover or obvious narrative, just a stream of vignettes – at times an almost surreal compilation of images strung together. There’s an unforgettable scene in a factory where female staff put the finishing touches to high-end sex dolls; deep in concentration, they meticulously hand-paint pink nipples. It’s sort of hilarious; one woman holds a doll’s legs akimbo as she leans in to trim its bikini line. But then, a colleague picks up a phallic-looking hot iron and burns a hole into the plastic flesh. It’s a disturbing image and made me think of the men who buy these anatomically freakish sex dolls. Then more practical concerns arise: where is this worker’s protective gear? Fake Christmas trees, jeans, squirty dispensers for cosmetics, unicorn tat, Make America Great Again merch (oh, the irony) – we watch the dizzying production line of capitalist excess. Nothing screams futility and waste like plastic mineral water bottles popping out of a factory machine by the hundreds. Through it all composer Dan Deacon’s string-heavy score strikes a cautionary note. There’s a lot of humour in the sections on China’s middle class and super-wealthy. In one semi-excruciating scene pupils at a butler school are instructed in how to take crap from a boss: “No matter how he humiliates you, pretend to be obedient.” Part of the film’s genius is in how the images are put together, sometimes to absurd effect, at other times unnervingly. The system is dehumanising but we see the emotions of the humans inside it. It’s a fascinating film about China that has universal things to say about income inequality and aspiration everywhere: how we’re all sold a dream that’s out of the reach of most.

1/10/2022,"Graham Thorpe, the interim head coach, described England’s dressing room as like a scene from *M*A*S*H* during the dramatic drawn Sydney Test. And at the end, after two old warhorses in Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad cussedly held firm, one of the injured had to be airlifted out of this gruelling Ashes campaign.Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow, so central to the outcome of a bruising battle, have flown with the squad to Hobart hoping to grit their teeth through Friday’s fifth Test with respective side and thumb problems. Mark Wood is nursing bruised toes from the Pat Cummins yorker that floored him. But Jos Buttler’s broken finger - collateral damage from a Wood missile that kept low - was bad enough to end his tour of duty.  Bairstow is technically the spare wicketkeeper but the cracked thumb tip he suffered during the first of two belligerent scores of 113 and 41, rules out retaking the gloves. And though Ollie Pope surpassed expectations as a substitute for Buttler behind the stumps, a frontline replacement was sought by an England side trailing 3-0.Enter Sam Billings, fresh from the Big Bash League and having answered a call-up 90 minutes before his intended flight for the T20 team’s upcoming Caribbean tour. Assurances he could still feature against West Indies - even if the first T20i in Barbados on 22 January comes too soon - were sought by a perennial drinks carrier and now a 10-hour hire car road trip down the east coast, plus isolation at the team hotel, looks set to be rewarded with an unexpected Test debut and becoming England cap No 700.“I am 100% ready if required, and I will give absolutely everything I can,” said Billings. “I have been playing consistent cricket and scoring runs. It doesn’t really matter what format it is, it’s more about rhythm, confidence and mindset. Like any side I go into I will try to make a positive impact on and off the field, in any environment I am put into.“The three guys who came out to bat in Sydney with injuries, that’s incredible courage, and exactly what everyone involved in English cricket is about – playing for each other and that resilience. There’s a lot of inspiration we can take from that as a group, that character and over-my-dead-body attitude.”Billings, 30, makes for interesting case study during English cricket’s current existential crisis. A popular and ever-willing fringe player in the well-stocked white-ball set up – winning 58 ODI and T20 caps from a possible 175 since his debut in 2015 – he is among a generation outside the central contract list who have felt encouraged to pursue globetrotting T20 careers. When picked up by the Indian Premier League in particular, this overlaps with big chunks of the red-ball summer. “It’s a hard one,” said Billings. “I think the contract situation is always a contentious one. As a non-contract [England] player, you have to maximise opportunities because you don’t have that fallback of being picked in the next [national] squad. I’ve only got one career, let’s say five to seven years left of playing cricket. [T20] has been an avenue for me to play cricket. There’s no right or wrong with any of this stuff. It has hampered, I suppose, my chances of playing four-day cricket and ultimately Test cricket.”The 10 first-class matches Billings has played for Kent since a shoulder injury saw him miss out on the 2019 World Cup squad have returned a batting average of 44.48 and three centuries. Along with an orthodox technique, successes against the higher pace of international attacks and solid glovework in all formats, it points to a player who, in a different era, might have stated a greater case than simply being in the same country.His nearest brush with a Test cap came in the summer when he was notably the only IPL returnee to burst out of quarantine and act as reserve wicketkeeper to James Bracey in the 1-0 defeat to New Zealand. Though his career differs to that of Usman Khawaja, his Sydney Thunder teammate, Billings is inspired by the “nothing-to-lose” attitude that saw the Australian seize his chance with sparkling twin centuries at the SCG during what was supposed to be a one-off recall. Billings said: “I thought he spoke fantastically well in terms of having that perspective, having that really open mind to the potential of what’s in front of him, and taking his opportunities. I am in a really good place in my own game. I have made some technical changes over the last few years that I feel have really improved my all-round game regardless of the format, so I’m ready to go if needs be. It doesn’t really matter what format it is, it’s more about rhythm, confidence and mindset.”Billings arrived from the Covid-afflicted BBL but, touch wood, has not thus far contracted the virus himself since the last English summer. He and Saqib Mahmood, another Caribbean-bound white-ball player, bubbled up and requested separate changing rooms to their Thunder teammates in the past fortnight to cut risk of transmission - with at least four cases in the squad to date, it looks a shrewd call.If picked, Billings would be a fifth Test wicketkeeper for England in the space of 12 months - the sixth if you count Pope’s substitute role - and goes against Chris Silverwood’s stated aim of not wanting to hand out debuts in Australia. As the Ashes battlefield has taught England’s head coach, who rejoins the camp after recovering from Covid-19, plans - best laid or otherwise - can go awry.",Sport/Sport,Sam Billings puts in the miles to pitch up for overdue England Test debut,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/sam-billings-puts-in-the-miles-to-pitch-up-for-overdue-england-test-debut-ashes-australia-cricket
1/10/2022,"The last seven years were the world’s hottest on record, with the first analysis of global temperature in 2021 showing it was 1.2C above pre-industrial levels. The assessment of the year, by the European climate agency Copernicus, also found carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached record levels and that the potent greenhouse gas methane surged “very substantially”, also to a new record.  The rise in greenhouse gas concentration means more heat is being trapped than ever before but 2021 ranked as the fifth hottest year on record. This is because a natural and cyclic climate phenomenon called La Niña exerted a cooling influence by bringing cold Pacific waters to the surface. The climate crisis continued unabated with extreme weather striking across the world. Europe suffered its hottest summer on record and broke its maximum temperature record in Sicily with 48.8C, while intense wildfires raged in Italy, Greece and Turkey. Severe floods made up to nine times more likely by global heating also wreaked havoc in Germany and Belgium Extreme heat also caused the “mother of all heatwaves” in the west of the US and Canada. Temperature records were smashed by 5C and scientists calculated the event was made at least 150 times more likely by global heating. In California, the Dixie wildfire was the second largest in history. China’s meteorological agency recently announced that 2021 was the country’s hottest year on record and that its northern region had its wettest year, with extreme weather widespread. Floods in July in Henan province caused hundreds of deaths. Mauro Facchini, the head of Earth observation for the European Commission, said: “The 2021 analysis is a reminder of the continued increase in global temperatures and the urgent necessity to act.” The Copernicus data shows 21 of the 22 hottest years have come since the year 2000. “The [extreme weather] events in 2021 are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society,” said Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus climate service. The average CO2 levels in 2021 reached a new record of 414 parts per million in 2021 – before the Industrial Revolution and large scale burning of fossil fuels the level was 280ppm. The rate of CO2 rise remained the same as it had since 2010, despite Covid-related lockdowns. Methane levels are accelerating with the growth rate in 2021 approximately three times the rate of a decade ago. Methane is emitted through fossil fuel exploitation, cattle and other livestock, and natural wetland processes and scientists are uncertain about the cause of the rapid rises. Vincent-Henri Peuch, at Copernicus, said: “CO2 and methane concentrations are continuing to increase year-on-year and without signs of slowing down. Prof Rowan Sutton, at the University of Reading, UK, said: “At a global level the warming may appear gradual but it is the impact on extreme events in many different parts of the world that is dramatic. We should see the record breaking 2021 events, such as the heatwave in Canada and floods in Germany, as a punch in the face to make politicians and public alike wake up to the urgency of the climate emergency.” Other temperature datasets for 2021 will be published in coming weeks by the UK and Japanese Met Offices and Nasa and Noaa in the US, with similar results expected.",News/Environment,"Climate crisis: last seven years the hottest on record, 2021 data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/climate-crisis-last-seven-years-the-hottest-on-record-2021-data-shows
1/10/2022,"Russian oligarchs’ use of London to launder their fortunes is to come under renewed scrutiny after the Conservative-controlled foreign affairs select committee agreed to re-examine the government’s apparent inability to crack down on the practice. The inquiry will be a concern to the Foreign Office, which has frequently been accused of leaving a gap between its tough anti-Russian rhetoric and failure to control either money laundering or those in the UK that enable the corruption.  The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, says the UK has some of the toughest anti-corruption laws in the world, but even in her short period in office she has been repeatedly challenged to review whether the laws are working effectively or adequately policed. The foreign affairs select committee inquiry will take the form of a follow-up to its previous inquiry, Moscow’s Gold, published in 2018 that found gaps in the government anti-corruption armoury. The 2018 report warned: “Turning a blind eye to London’s role in hiding the proceeds of Kremlin-connected corruption risks signalling that the UK is not serious about confronting the full spectrum of President Putin’s offensive measures”. Since then the prestigious thinktank Chatham House has argued the UK does have a problem with Russian money, claiming the law in this area is so poorly constructed and under-resourced that it amounts to self-regulation. But the government is also accused of dragging its heels on implementing relevant laws including a public register of beneficial owners of overseas entities that buy or sell property. The measure was first announced in 2016, but has been repeatedly delayed. In a sign of the damage to the government’s reputation, the government last month published an update of its anti-corruption strategy that reported the UK and overseas territories topped the financial secrecy index, a government recognised global survey of financial transparency. Confirming the fresh inquiry, Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the committee, said: “We have again to address the issue of the dirty money in the UK,” adding: “We will be looking more at where this money is going. We will be highlighting the overseas territories.” In a reference to the still stalled Nord Stream 2 project taking gas from Russia to Germany, he said: “We will be looking at how energy projects are used to exploit our dependence on petrochemicals and our dependence on energy, and to turn that dependence against us.” The inquiry is likely to start in the spring, Tugendhat said, adding the issue may not be the laws on the statute book, but the way they are policed. Chris Bryant, a senior Labour MP on the committee, claimed the UK had been getting its Russia policy wrong for two decades. He said: “We tempt Russian oligarchs to the United Kingdom with easy visas: we had these golden visas that largely went to extremely wealthy oligarchs who had made their money corruptly in Russia, with no questions asked other than: ‘Do you have enough money?’ We did not even ask: ‘Are you going to invest it in the United Kingdom?’ “We boast about our clever lawyers and accountants who can tidy things up so that assets are protected however they have been obtained. We open up our high-end housing market to Russian billionaires even though we know that the best way to squirrel away a dirty fortune or, indeed, to launder £20m is to buy a property that is worth £10m for £20m. “That is precisely what has affected the London housing market so deleteriously. We even grant – government ministers do this – some Russian individuals anonymity in what is meant to be the public register in Companies House of beneficial ownership of companies.” He said: “We must have a public register of beneficial ownership that should apply to the owners of overseas companies operating or purchasing property in the United Kingdom. That still does not exist; I simply do not understand why.” He added unexplained wealth orders, once championed as the way of seizing corrupt cash of the oligarchs, appear to have failed. Only four such orders have been issued and some rejected on the basis that cash can only be seized if it can be proven the cash was gained illegally in the jurisdiction in which the money was made, a high hurdle in some former Soviet Republics. Bryant also called for a review of why overseas territories were still stalling over implementing public registries of beneficial ownership. He said: “We need to ensure that the overseas territories do not become a soft backyard, where people can hide vast amounts of money corruptly, effectively under the British banner. That is not a patriotic commitment by the overseas territories. The patriotic commitment that the overseas territories should be making to Britain is to put public beneficial ownership registers in place as soon as possible.”",News/Politics,MPs to re-examine UK response to dirty money from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/10/mps-to-re-examine-uk-response-to-dirty-money-from-russia
1/10/2022,"Covid-19 spurred wealthy motorists to buy more Rolls-Royces than ever before because it made them realise life is short, the luxury carmaker has said. As global cases escalated in 2021, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, based in Goodwood, West Sussex, booked the highest annual sales in its 117-year history, selling 5,586 vehicles.  The company’s chief executive, Torsten Müller-Ötvös, said the pandemic had led to customers, whose average age was 43, responding to the reminder of their own mortality by splashing out on luxury cars. “Many people witnessed people in their community dying from Covid and that made them think life can be short and you’d better live now rather than postpone until a later date,” said Müller-Ötvös. “That has helped Rolls-Royce.” He said the carmaker, owned by BMW, had also benefited from the restrictions the pandemic had placed on wealthy consumers’ opportunities to spend their money elsewhere. “It is very much due to Covid that the entire luxury business is booming worldwide,” he said. “People couldn’t travel a lot, they couldn’t invest a lot into luxury services … and there is quite a lot of money accumulated that is spent on luxury goods.” He said sales had risen in every part of the world, an unusual trend, with Greater China and the Americas remaining the two biggest markets, each at 30% of sales. No other manufacturer sold more cars for more than €250,000 (£208,000), he said. The Phantom model was the company’s biggest seller but its Cullinan SUV accounted for 30% of 2021 sales. Its first fully electric car, the Spectre, is due to be delivered in 2023 ahead of a move to stop producing combustion engines and go fully electric by 2030. With the pandemic showing no sign of curbing the spending power of the extremely rich, Rolls-Royce also announced a “coach-built” service that will allow devotees of the marque to design their own car over four years. This will allow them to purchase “something money normally can’t buy but you can get it with us”, Müller-Ötvös said. He added that Brexit had caused unnecessary difficulties for Rolls-Royce because of restrictions on staff movement and the administrative burden of exporting, a problem for a carmaker that sends 90% of its British-made vehicles overseas. “Brexit definitely didn’t make our life in any way easier,” he said. Any impact on the company’s costs will not show up until it reports full accounts later this year. According to the latest accounts filed at Companies House in June, pretax profit for 2020 was £61m, down from £97m in 2019.
