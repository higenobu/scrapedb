4/23/2022,"The home secretary has been accused of misleading parliament after a high court ruling revealed that unpublished parts of a controversial policy to push back migrant dinghies in the Channel said the tactic would not be used against asylum seekers. The pushbacks policy was finalised in autumn 2021, yet in January this year Priti Patel said pushing back migrant boats was “absolutely still policy” when she gave evidence to the Lords justice and home affairs committee. She has been accused of giving that evidence even though she knew about the unpublished clauses in the policy not to use pushbacks against asylum seekers. The former shadow attorney general, Shami Chakrabarti, accused Patel of misleading parliament and called on her to apologise: “This judgment reveals the home secretary connived to mislead refugees, voters and parliament that people expressly seeking asylum could be repelled in UK waters. Priti Patel must apologise and rethink large sections of her borders bill before it returns to the Lords. It is a disgraceful breach of the rule of law.” Details of the unpublished policy came to light during a legal challenge to the pushbacks plan brought by the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), and the NGOs Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom From Torture. The Home Office had applied to the high court for public interest immunity to avoid making the details of the pushbacks policy public. This mechanism is used where sensitive issues such as organised crime, terrorism or national security are involved. But judges said disclosure of the policy did not “give rise to a real risk of serious harm to the public interest”. The government has always said the pushbacks policy would only be used when safe to deploy it. Restrictions on usage of the tactic are outlined in the nationality and borders bill which is due to return to the House of Lords on 26 April. However, since the policy was announced last October ministers have not said publicly that it would not be used against asylum seekers. A key part of the unpublished policy disclosed in the high court judgment is that anyone in a dinghy who indicates they wish to claim asylum in the UK should not be pushed back but instead escorted to UK shores. Almost everyone who uses this method to reach the UK is an asylum seeker according to the Home Office’s own data. The ruling reveals the pushback policy states: “Should a migrant request asylum whilst in UK territorial waters they must be returned to the UK for processing.” According to the high court judgment, a clause in the unpublished policy says “the actual number of migrant vessels successfully intercepted is likely to be extremely low”. It adds that one of the “acceptable outcomes” is that during operational deployments no migrant vessels are assessed as suitable for safe turnaround. Paul O’Connor, the head of bargaining at the PCS, said: “PCS has been pressing the Home Office for transparency in these proceedings. They have gone to considerable lengths to keep certain matters shrouded in secrecy. This judgment has left them nowhere to hide and has exposed their real agenda.” Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: “I’m shocked that this government tried to hide the fact that refugees who request asylum in UK waters have a right to be brought to the UK to process that request.” Toufique Hossain, the director of public law at Duncan Lewis solicitors, who represents PCS and Care4Calais, described the judgment as “deeply concerning”. “In light of the extreme measures that are now being taken and proposed to prevent asylum claims being considered in the UK, there is a greater need than ever for transparency.” In a speech on 14 April about tackling illegal migration, the prime minister said Channel pushbacks were unlikely to be used much although provision for the tactic remained in the immigration bill. “It’s clear that there are extremely limited circumstances when you can safely do this in the English Channel,” Johnson said. A government spokesperson said: “The entire government is united to protect lives, prevent dangerous Channel crossings and break the business model of criminal gangs profiting from these fatal journeys. “It is right to consider all safe and legal options to prevent people making these unnecessary journeys, all of which comply with both domestic and international law.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel accused of misleading parliament over refugee pushbacks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/priti-patel-accused-misleading-parliament-refugee-pushbacks

4/23/2022,"Photographer Josh Edgoose has always tried to capture “moments that feel a bit strange”. Until recently, photography was a hobby, and when lockdown first hit, he was limited to the area surrounding his home in Hounslow, London, for inspiration. “We live under a flight path, so planes go by every 10 minutes or so,” Edgoose says. “This beautiful rainbow appeared and I went out hoping to capture it as one flew over. I knew I had only two or three shots before the rainbow faded. The bird was complete luck. There is even another one peeking out from behind the chimney pot.” As he primarily shoots on a 28mm or 35mm wide-angle lens, he reached for his iPhone 13 to allow him to zoom in. While some have doubted the authenticity of the shot, it all came down to serendipitous timing. The only edits Edgoose made were to add contrast and warm the white balance. “If you throw a brick in the air, it will land on a photographer. But people don’t realise the time and the years of practice and refinement it takes – probably because they don’t see the bad shots!” he says, adding that “there is definitely an element of luck at play, too. It doesn’t happen often, so it’s incredibly satisfying when it works out as well as this.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘The bird was complete luck’: Josh Edgoose’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/23/bird-was-complete-luck-josh-edgoose-best-phone-picture
4/23/2022,"Large online platforms including Facebook, Google and Twitter will have to do more to tackle illegal content or face multibillion euro fines under a new European Union regulatory regime agreed on Saturday. The wide-ranging Digital Services Act (DSA) can fine a company up to 6% of its global turnover for violating the rules – which would be $7bn (£5.9bn) in the case of Facebook’s owner – while repeated breaches could result in a tech firm being banned from doing business in the EU. The new rules, which come into force in 2024, include:  Banning advertising aimed at children or based on sensitive data such as religion, gender, race and political opinions  Allowing EU governments to request removal of illegal content, including material that promotes terrorism, child sexual abuse, hate speech and commercial scams  Forcing social media platforms to allow users to flag illegal content in an “easy and effective way” so that it can be swiftly removed  Online marketplaces like Amazon will need similar systems for suspect products, such as counterfeit sneakers or unsafe toys The DSA has been drawn up against a backdrop of political and regulatory action against online platforms around the world. The UK is introducing the Online Safety Bill, which imposes a duty of care on tech firms to shelter users from harmful content, while in the US, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have filed antitrust actions against Google and Facebook. The agreement in the early hours of Saturday came after more than 16 hours of negotiations between EU member states, the EU’s executive arm and EU parliamentarians. The DSA is the second prong of EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager’s strategy to rein in the US tech giants. Last month, she won backing from the 27-country bloc and EU parliament for landmark rules called the Digital Markets Act that could force Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft to change their core business practices in Europe. “We have a deal on the DSA: the Digital Services Act will make sure that what is illegal offline is also seen and dealt with as illegal online – not as a slogan, as reality,” Vestager said in a tweet. The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said: “With the DSA, the time of big online platforms behaving like they are too big to care is coming to an end.” Other measures in the DSA will require large online platforms and online search engines to take specific measures during a crisis. Theywere triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the related disinformation. The companies could be forced to hand over data related to their algorithms to regulators and researchers. The companies also face a yearly fee of up to 0.05% of worldwide annual revenue to cover the costs of monitoring their compliance. Flora Rebello Arduini, a director at SumOfUs, which campaigns for corporate accountability, said: “This law is a massive victory for people across Europe who have stood up to demand an end to the era of big tech abuses. It also sends a strong signal to leaders everywhere – citizens will not sit back while unregulated and unrestrained tech corporations play havoc with their communities.” In a statement, Google said: “As the law is finalised and implemented, the details will matter. We look forward to working with policymakers to get the remaining technical details right to ensure the law works for everyone.”",News/World news,EU agrees rules to force big tech to rein in illegal content or face huge fines,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/23/eu-agrees-rules-to-force-big-tech-to-rein-in-content-or-face-huge-fines
4/23/2022,"The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, refused to take questions from media on Saturday – despite addressing a campaign rally and touring a boating, camping and fishing store for the cameras on the New South Wales Central Coast. Labor has repeatedly criticised the prime minister for “going missing” on the Solomon Islands security deal with China, with questions raised over when the federal government became aware of the draft security pact. An Australian intelligence agency was aware of the pact days ahead of it being made public in March and played a role in leaking the text on social media, according to Nine newspapers quoting government and security sources. The claim brings into question the foreign minister, Marise Payne, informing Senate estimates she only became aware of the draft agreement after it was leaked. On Saturday, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, would not say when Australia first knew of the pact between Solomon Islands and China, saying instead that “we’ve known that this was always a risk”, and adding that “we’ve known that there were discussions under way”. He also told Weekend Sunrise that the government could do little more to assist Solomon Islands, describing its existing aid as a “full court press”. The deputy Labor leader, Richard Marles, accused the government of failing to build and maintain relationships in the Pacific, saying on Saturday that the deal “definitely raises the increased prospect of Chinese military presence in the Pacific and that makes Australia less safe and that is because Scott Morrison wasn’t doing his job”. The prime minister spruiked a strong economy and low unemployment rate while addressing a campaign rally at Tumbi Umbi in the seat of Dobell – and took a veiled swipe at the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese. “Despite our challenge being 30 times greater than what Labor faced, our employment outcomes were 50% better,” he said, contrasting the global financial crisis and pandemic recovery. “People might forget figures here and there. But if you don’t know what’s happening with unemployment in this country – that’s one of the most fundamental things when you’re seeking to drive economic policy.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The prime minister earlier attended the boating, camping and fishing store after the Coalition pledged $20m for more camping and fishing facilities. The only official press conference of the Coalition campaign for the day was given by the finance minister, Simon Birmingham. In Sydney, the former prime minister John Howard used the Liberal party’s campaign launch for its candidate in the seat of Bennelong, Simon Kennedy, to criticise the wave of high-profile independent candidates running in wealthy Liberal seats, such as Allegra Spender in Wentworth, Kylea Tink in North Sydney and Zoe Daniel in Goldstein. Howard said: “These men and women are all posing as independents. They’re not independents, they’re anti-Liberal groupies. “Their aim is to hurt the Liberal party, not to represent the middle ground of their electorates.” He told the event at Ryde-Eastwood Leagues Club that if the independents supported by Simon Holmes à Court’s Climate 200 group were “genuinely independent” they would also run in safe Labor seats. “They don’t represent disgruntled Liberals. They represent a group in the community that wants to destroy the Liberal government. It’s as simple as that. “That is why they’re running in seats like Wentworth and North Sydney and Mackellar, and Goldstein in Victoria.” Guardian Australia analysis shows Liberal MPs in at-risk “teal” seats are being left with little financial support from the Coalition in the lead-up to the election, at the same time as they are being outspent on advertising by their independent challengers. The Coalition has committed a total of just $92m out of a total of almost $6bn in discretionary spending to the seats of Wentworth, Mackellar, North Sydney, Kooyong, Goldstein, Warringah and Curtin since the beginning of the year.

The former prime minister lost his seat to Labor’s Maxine McKew in the wipeout election of 2007 before John Alexander won it back in 2010. Bennelong was held by Alexander on a 6.9% margin at the 2019 election, where the former tennis star suffered a 2.8% swing against him. The independent MP for Warringah, Zali Steggall, was not impressed with Howard’s words, calling it “appallingly sexist language”. Howard slams ‘anti-Liberal groupies’. Appalling sexist language by John Howard. It explains a lot of the culture of the Liberal party & it’s problem with women. Women in politics shouldn’t be denigrated with this type of language. #enoughisenough #auspol https://t.co/JnBz3dPGR9 At his own campaign launch in Brisbane, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, accused the government of wasting money and rorting the public purse. “We want Australia ... to generate opportunities people can grab and be proud of so they can provide for their loved ones and create great futures,” he said. “The thanks that people get for the sacrifices they’ve made for each other [in the pandemic] can’t be another three years of a rotten government. It can’t be another three years of wages going down while prices are going up.” The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who tested positive to Covid on Thursday, tweeted a photo of himself purportedly working on his campaign launch speech from isolation.
