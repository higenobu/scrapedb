4/12/2022,"On 12 April last year, Carlo Ancelotti was in charge of an Everton team that drew 0-0 with Brighton and he says he would not have given it up for anything – except for the place he finds himself 12 months on. Had it not been Real Madrid who called, the Italian insists he would have stayed at Goodison Park, but it was and now he leads the team that stand 12 points clear at the top of La Liga and seemingly on the cusp of a Champions League semi-final place having beaten Chelsea 3-1 in the quarter-final first leg at Stamford Bridge. At the end of that match, Thomas Tuchel said the tie was over but Ancelotti said they would come to fight to go through and Carlos Casemiro insisted they do not “trust” the Chelsea manager. The midfielder also asked supporters not to whistle Gareth Bale, saying that to do so would be to “whistle Madrid’s history” and urged them to play their part on Tuesday night. Fans turned on Bale on Saturday when he came on for his first appearance at the Santiago Bernabéu since February 2020. “I don’t agree with them whistling a player on my team,” Casemiro said. “The support has to be for everyone. When they whistle a player, they whistle all of us. I didn’t like them whistling the other day: he’s a historic player at this club, he has scored lots of goals, he is important here. When you whistle a player like that, you’re whistling the club’s history. “We have to approach it knowing that it is a hard game even though we played our best 90 minutes [in London]. We can’t trust anything, especially not the words from their coach afterwards, from Tuchel. We have to ask the fans to support us. They are the champions, the holders, they have our total respect. The fans and us have to give everything because it will be a very, very difficult game.” Ancelotti laughed at attempts to make him accept that Madrid were favourites and waved away suggestions that Tuchel might be playing mind games. “Everyone has their own opinion,” he said. “Chelsea will come to fight to try to get through. [Tuchel] knows very well that it is complicated but he’s going to try. That’s the spirit of football and above all of big, strong teams that never give up.” None are bigger than Madrid, which is why Ancelotti is here, his success so far suggesting that although he arrived as a short-term solution, he may yet continue next season. “I felt very good at Everton: we worked very well, the relationship was very good with staff and club, and then the call from Madrid came,” he said. “I can understand that they get angry with me at Everton, but it was really difficult to say no to Madrid. Madrid were the only club I would have left for. To anyone else I could have said no [and] stayed happily at Everton. “I am not thinking about [next season]. My contract is very long but I am not thinking about that. If the club is happy, I’ll continue happily. If the club is not happy, I will be grateful for the time I spent here. I’m confident that the season will end well, then I can continue happily.”",Sport/Football,Ancelotti defends leaving Everton for Madrid as Casemiro urges Bale ‘support’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/carlo-ancelotti-defends-leaving-everton-for-real-madrid-as-carlos-casemiro-urges-gareth-bale-support
4/12/2022,"Javier Aguirre was first into the dressing room and first out again. “Those bastards put the music on full blast, so I had to leave,” the Real Mallorca manager said when he reappeared in the tunnel, and you couldn’t really blame him. Couldn’t really blame them, either. They had waited a long time for this, after all: Mallorca hadn’t even picked up a point since Valentine’s Day, seven consecutive defeats seeing them slip into the relegation zone and the coach who had brought them up depart in tears, sacked in favour of a final throw of the dice, but now at last they had won again. And against the champions too. “Liberation,” defender Pablo Maffeo called it once he had hauled himself back onto his feet at Son Moix, and it showed. That was Saturday afternoon; by the end of a wild weekend, it felt even better, everything falling into place for the first time in weeks. Vedat Muriqi’s penalty had given Mallorca a 1-0 lead over Atlético Madrid with 22 minutes remaining that became 32. The week before they had been beaten in the 82nd minute at Getafe, against Betis it had been the 83rd, and Celta defeated them 4-3 in the 97th so they knew it wasn’t over even deep into 10 minutes of added time, clinging to a lifeline that could be lost. Every tackle and header clear was celebrated. Behind the goal, Jan Oblak confronted the ball boys. Idrissu Baba got hit full in the face. Antonio Raíllo fell too. And if, when asked how his injured player was, Aguirre admitted “faking it”, the tension was real – whistles frantic as the clock ticked towards three digits. Afterwards, Aguirre was asked what it had been like for him, how he had lived it all. “Surprisingly calmly,” he replied. Having taken over as coach from Luis García 20 days before, called in on another rescue mission – “I climbed aboard a boat out on the open sea, defeat, defeat, defeat, watching [the shore] slip away” – he had lost to a single goal in his opening game at Getafe and this was his first game at home. “It was fantastic,” he said. “Those final minutes were a fantastic experience: I looked up and I was delighted, all the people behind the team all game, all the flags, the noise on the crosses, the headers, whistling the referee. I was quite calm: maybe it’s my age. But the bench wasn’t, that’s the truth.” Alongside him, no one was sitting any more as those final seconds played out. Ángel Rodríguez was on his knees. When Take Kubo got the ball and headed up the wing, they all pointed frantically at the corner. When he lost it, they all panicked. But Maffeo came flying in and made the tackle, the whistle went, and they ran onto the pitch while Aguirre turned straight down the tunnel. Maffeo sank to his knees, the poster from Platoon. Kubo did a roly-poly. Dani Rodríguez cried. Stumbling, shoulders rolling, barely able to walk, Jaume Costa guided him like he was helping a drunk pal get home from the pub. Around the ground they sang: “Yes, we can!” And that’s a start. It wasn’t pretty, Palma newspaper Última Hora calling the first half “horrible,” “soporific” and “primitive”, 45 minutes in which the best thing that happened was the whistle that brought them to an end. And yet they also called it “the perfect afternoon.” The front page declared this a “revival”. Inside it said: “Eight weeks later, Mallorca opened their eyes again, breathed again, recovered hope and a pulse; they lived again. They broke out of the glass cell that imprisoned them, smashing it into a thousand pieces.” They had needed a debatable penalty to win it, Oblak ignored advice from the Jackson Five and blamed it on the sunshine, and it wasn’t even the first time Mallorca had beaten Atlético this season, so they know his doesn’t guarantee anything. But this win had pulled them back out of the relegation zone and they had desperately needed it. Aguirre had said the day before they just had to win any way they can, if only to believe that they actually can. Aguirre is “fresh air,” Maffeo said afterwards. Usually, he turns it blue. Listen to his interviews and they’re full of bleeps; listen to him talk, uncensored, and there are cabrones, carambas and chinga madres all over the place. Charismatic and direct, he is honest, fantastically engaging company, seemingly forever cackling like Sid James. There is something very seductive about him, swiftly getting under his players’ skin and everyone else’s too, and this is his kind of challenge. Which is also his problem: his coaching career goes back almost 30 years and has taken him all over the world – although he still regrets not getting the job at Athletic or West Brom – but there is a risk of him being cast only as a man to call when you’re in trouble, a fast fix, which is why this time he insisted on a second year if he saves Mallorca. Thing is, that “if” comes first – and that’s where he comes in. Kicking about at home, keen to work again even at 63 years old, his wife keen for him to work again too, it took Aguirre four minutes to accept the offer. It helped that there are, he thinks, seven or eight teams with whom Mallorca can realistically compete, which brings hope. Survival was not such a monumental task, if they could find the formula. This is not really about style, although it starts with the defence, with what he calls “stopping the bleeding”; it’s more about the mind, convincing them they can compete, confronting reality. “The player has to understand where he is. He can’t keep playing as if there’s no problem: there is,” Aguirre says. “You have to chase every ball as if it was your last; if you don’t, you’re no use for primera.” Beating the champions offered a path, taking them into 17th, on 29 points. Better still, everything else fell their way too on an extraordinary weekend at the bottom, a series of interconnected and often absurd stories of suffering from all over Spain, fate in each other’s hands. On Friday night, Granada (16th, 29 points) went from 2-2 to 4-2 down at Sevilla, conceding goals in the 93rd and 99th minutes. Immediately before Mallorca kicked off against Atlético, the Cádiz coach Sergio González sat with his head in his hands having seen his team (18th, 28 points) lead Real Betis only to concede an equaliser on 79 minutes. Then, with five minutes to go, he saw them give away a “joke” penalty: Rubén Alcaraz swiped, missed the ball entirely and instead kicked Borja Iglesias, giving away a penalty which Iglesias scored. “We didn’t deserve that,” Sergio said, and he wasn’t alone in feeling that way. The next day, Elche (15th, 31 points) led early against Real Sociedad, but lost 2-1. “We didn’t want this, but that’s football,” the manager Francisco said after their fifth defeat in six, safety suddenly no longer secure. Worse was Alavés (20th, 31 points), under their third coach of the season and beaten by an Ante Budimir goal in the 93rd minute at Osasuna. “I have no words,” goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco said afterwards, a broken man suspecting the last chance has gone. “It’s been happening all year: we put our hearts into it, but nothing comes off. It’s very hard to take.” And in a game that had everything, including a referee taking out a player, Levante (19th, 22 points) had three penalties against Barcelona, scored two of them, saw the goal of the season cleared off the line, led 1-0, came back from 2-1 down, and lost to a 92nd-minute Luuk de Jong winner. “We were so close,” said captain José Luis Morales. In the end, the only team in the bottom nine to win was Mallorca, a group of fans still waiting for their coach 90 minutes after full time. They were a bit drunk, Aguirre admitted, but they were convinced and now maybe the players can be too. “They know how to play football, hell, but there was a weight on their shoulders that got bigger and bigger and bigger,” he said. “Today, whoa: it’s a huge weight off. You get out of the relegation zone, release the pressure. Do you know what it’s like to go seven weeks losing, going home and thinking ‘I did everything I could … and I lost again’? Now at last they can have a couple of beers, see their wives and kids, see their friends, enjoy themselves after so long.” Back in the dressing room they had already started, volume turned up as loud as it would go.

4/12/2022,"Russia’s finance minister has said the Kremlin will take legal action if the west tries to force it to default on its sovereign debt as part of sanctions placed on the country after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. In comments hitting back against US, UK and EU-led sanctions, Anton Siluanov told the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper that Russia had taken “all the necessary steps” to pay its international creditors. In response to sweeping financial sanctions imposed on Russian banks since the war in Ukraine began, the Kremlin has said it would pay holders of its dollar-denominated bonds in roubles. However, many investors would view this as a form of default, a situation in which governments are unable to keep up their debt payments. Siluanov suggested Russia could go to court to argue that the terms of its repayments had been met, without saying where such a hearing could happen. “Of course we will sue, because we have taken all the necessary steps to ensure that investors receive their payments,” he said. “We will present in court our bills confirming our efforts to pay both in foreign currency and in roubles. It will not be an easy process. We will have to very actively prove our case, despite all the difficulties,” he added. The credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s said last week that it believed Russia had made debt payments on its US dollar-denominated bonds in roubles when payments were due on 4 April. It had been due to make a payment of $649m (£498m) to holders of two of its sovereign bonds, although it was blocked from doing so by US sanctions preventing Russia from using dollars to service its debts. Investors are not expected to be able to convert those payments into dollars equivalent to the original amounts the Russian government was due to pay. “We think sanctions on Russia are likely to be further increased in the coming weeks, hampering Russia’s willingness and technical abilities to honour the terms and conditions of its obligations to foreign debtholders,” Standard & Poor’s said. Russia has a 30-day grace period to make payments. With government debt worth about $40bn in foreign currency bonds, the country has so far managed to avoid defaulting on its debts. However, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury are designed to force the country to choose between draining remaining dollar reserves or defaulting on its obligations.",News/World news,"Kremlin will take legal action if Russia pushed into default, minister threatens",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/kremlin-will-take-legal-action-if-russia-pushed-into-default-threatens-minister
4/12/2022,"Easter weekend could see the hottest temperatures of the year so far across the UK, with highs of up to 22C in some areas, weather forecasters have said. Warm weather is set to continue throughout the week, with dry conditions expected for most of the country ahead of the bank holiday. Annie Shuttleworth, a Met Office meterologist, said that despite the heat, the north-west of England will also experience some lingering cloud, making eastern areas the best destination for sun-seekers over the weekend. “If people are travelling for sunshine, then further eastern areas are more likely to see that brighter weather,” she said. “I think in the main for the bank holiday weekend, we’ll see temperatures quite widely above average across the UK and hopefully they could be very warm in the south-east in particular. Warmer than average certainly, but nowhere near heatwave criteria. It will definitely be warmer than the week we’ve just had and last week.” The warmest temperature seen so far this year has been 20.8C, meaning that the temperature highs predicted for the south-east over the Easter weekend would set a new record for 2022. Shuttleworth added: “We’ll see temperatures generally come up through the week. [On Monday] we’re seeing highs of 18, then from Thursday onwards temperatures could reach 20, 21, quite possibly 22. “Across southern and eastern areas we’re more likely to see some sunshine and clearer skies in the afternoon.” The warmest weather during the week is expected to be seen across Kent and Surrey, whereas temperatures in regions across the West Country are expected to be slightly lower. The coldest weather in the UK in the upcoming week is expected across the north of England and Scotland. The early part of the week will also see some windy conditions, with a chance that gust of winds could reach up to 60mph. Later in the week, some drizzly rain is expected across the north-west along with cloudy conditions, although this is not expected to cause disruption. The rainy showers are expected to be the heaviest in the west and north-west, with also a chance of some thunder.",News/UK news,Easter weekend could see hottest UK temperatures of the year – Met Office,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/easter-weekend-could-see-hottest-uk-temperatures-of-the-year-met-office
4/12/2022,"I am sick of hearing that wealthy people who use tax-avoidance schemes are “doing nothing wrong”. The only reason they are doing nothing wrong is that other wealthy people – friends, relatives, business associates, old school chums – in the legislature have built loopholes into the tax system for this purpose. We have a collusive system where members of an exclusive clique gain access to the legislature, often while funded by others of the clique, and create legislation that only applies to those outside the clique and creates a lower-tax life for those within it. Other people dodging tax are doing something wrong; the only reason these people are doing nothing wrong is that their tax-reduction schemes come with immunity. To place some people above the laws that govern the rest of society is to create something between a kleptocracy and an oligarchy. Colluding in such a system is doing something wrong.Dr Stephen RileyBruton, Somerset  “X pays the full amount of tax they are legally obliged to pay in the UK” is a meaningless statement, given the modest outlay on lawyers and tax havens required to reduce that tax to a risible amount. “Morally obliged to pay” should be used as an accompanying measure in public discourse.

4/12/2022,"The last Ukrainian soldiers defending Mariupol said they were “running out of ammunition” on Monday and expected to be killed or taken prisoner very soon by Russian forces surrounding the city. Writing on Facebook the 36th brigade said its 47-day defence of Mariupol was coming to a tragic conclusion. “We were bombed from airplanes and shot at by artillery and tanks. We have been doing everything possible and impossible. But any resource has the potential to run out,” it said. Russian troops have been besieging the city on the sea of Azov since the beginning of March. The territory controlled by Ukrainian forces has gradually shrunk to a few central areas. The surviving marines are now holed up in the Azovstal iron and steelworks next to the port. “The enemy gradually pushed us back. They surrounded us with fire, and are now trying to destroy us,” the marines posted. The “mountain of wounded” amounted to nearly half of the brigade, they added, with those “whose limbs are not torn off” continuing to fight. Their infantry soldiers had all been killed. The “shootings battles” against the Russians were now being conducted by artillerymen and anti-aircraft gunners, as well as radio operators, drivers and cooks. Even musicians from the orchestra were fighting, they said. The desperate last bulletin came as Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia had “destroyed” Mariupol. “There are tens of thousands of dead. Even despite this the Russians are not stopping their offensive,” he told South Korea’s parliament. Zelenskiy said it was too soon for Ukraine to declare it had won the battle for Kyiv, given the scale of the suffering of civilians living in Russian-occupied areas on the capital’s garden suburbs. “Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel – if the people of those [towns] were wiped out, then did we win this battle? I’m not sure. We’ve withstood, and we did not give up what is ours. But whether we won, I can’t say,” he told CBS News. The exact number of residents killed in Mariupol is unlikely to be known. Its Ukrainian-controlled council said the Russians had been collecting the bodies of the dead – many of them lying in shattered streets – and incinerating them in a mobile crematorium. After failing to seize Kyiv, Russia has refocused its military efforts on the eastern Donbas region. When Mariupol falls Russian tactical battalions are expected to advance north and to try to link up with other military columns moving south from the city of Iyzum and the Kharkiv region. Western officials said they expected Russia to try to “double or perhaps even treble” its forces in Donbas as it shifts forces from Kyiv and elsewhere in the coming weeks. The first of those forces had begun to redeploy via Belarus, but the whole exercise would take “some considerable time” and it was unclear how many units could be effectively brought back into battle. Ukraine’s defence ministry said a full-scale Kremlin attack is likely. “They have almost finished their preparations. We expect an offensive in the near future,” spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk told the Guardian. Asked if the Russians could encircle Ukraine’s defending eastern army, he replied: “We are not going to let this happen.” Ukraine’s high command faces an urgent tactical dilemma. Several Russian battalions retreated late last month from the Kyiv region to Belarus. Some are now making the long journey via Belgorod on the Russian side of the border, to redeploy into the south-east of Ukraine. Other units have stayed put. If Kyiv moves the bulk of its forces to the Donetsk and Luhansk territories, this would leave the capital exposed to a second surprise Russian attack from Belarus. In their message the marines in Mariupol also say they feel “written off” by their commander in chief. They say repeated promises to relieve the crushing Russian blockade of the city, or to evacuate some of their wounded by helicopter, came to nothing. “There were chances. Due to silliness they were not implemented,” the brigade wrote. Like Mariupol’s trapped civilian population, the soldiers have been living in hellish conditions. “For more than a month, we fought without resupplying our ammunition, without food, without water,” the marines posted, adding that they were forced to drink water from puddles. The message ends: “It’s death for some of us, and captivity for the rest. Do not talk badly about the Marines. For we are FAITHFUL FOREVER!” Russia has claimed it targeted Ukrainian air defence systems in airstrikes overnight which completely destroyed the airport in the eastern city of Dnipro. Another attack wounded five people in the town of Zvonetsky, according to Ukrainian officials. Emergency workers were also combing through an infrastructure facility in Zvonetsky that was attacked on Monday. Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said casualty figures would be given at a later point. Reznichenko earlier said that the Dnipro attack had wounded one person, while rockets had sparked a fire that was eventually put out. A missile had also hit a building in the Pavlohrad district, he added. Separately, the head of the Dnipro region council, Mykola Lukashuk, said five staff members of the state emergency service had been wounded by the strike on the airport. Russia said that it had targeted an S-300 air defence missile system transported to Ukraine by Slovenia last week, a claim denied by Slovenia. Kyiv has repeatedly begged its western allies for long-range air defence systems to help it against the Russian invasion. Dnipro, an industrial city home to 1 million people, has become a vital reception point for Ukrainians from farther east who have been told to evacuate in the face of both Russian advances on the ground and intensifying airstrikes and artillery attacks. There seems little prospect Moscow will stop its Ukraine invasion any time soon. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said negotiation talks with Ukraine would continue, but stressed in an interview with Itar-Tass there will be no pause in hostilities until a final agreement is reached and signed.",News/World news,Last marines defending Mariupol ‘running out of ammunition’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/ukraine-last-marines-defending-mariupol-running-out-of-ammunition
4/12/2022,"Rory McIlroy has been dejected enough times when exiting on to Washington Road via Magnolia Lane that he is entitled to savour a sense of harmony after leaving Augusta National this year. If the latest staging of the Masters ultimately belonged to Scottie Scheffler, it was a tournament dominated by other themes. Fascination regarding Tiger Woods’s every move was clear by the depth of galleries and television ratings. And when those around the 18th green roared for McIlroy’s hole out from a bunker, it was the loudest celebration of day four. That Scheffler four-putted his final hole played a part in that scenario but we had already been served a reminder of the extent to which people want McIlroy to regain his major winning touch. McIlroy’s own display of emotion resonated; he had given himself a chance to win the Green Jacket as his bunker shot rolled in. Augusta National offered evidence of just how spellbindingly good McIlroy in full flow is to watch. It should not serve as criticism of Scheffler – a man in the midst of extraordinary form – to point out he cannot move the needle to anything like the same degree as the Masters runner-up. McIlroy’s 64 on Sunday was his lowest Masters round. It was a score which went way beyond core statistics. McIlroy, who speaks of building up a positive “memory bank” demonstrated he can tame Augusta. He challenged seriously for the first major of the year; cynics may bemoan the belated nature of that but McIlroy was ultimately the only real threat to Scheffler. Moreover, there is now validation to McIlroy’s recent work, including reacquainting with his old coach, Michael Bannon. “It’s no good feeling like your game is in good shape, finishing 30th every week and saying you’re on the right path,” McIlroy said. “Every now and again, it’s nice to have results like this just to reaffirm that what you’re doing are the right things. The only person to beat me in the Masters is the guy that’s currently the best golfer in the world. “I’m on the right track and doing the right things. It was just nice to feel that buzz in a major championship again. It’s been a while since I felt that, I think the last time was trying to make the cut at an Open Championship [at Portrush in 2019]. So this was certainly better than that. I’m excited going forward. I don’t think it just sets me up for next year at the Masters, it sets me up for the rest of the year. I feel like my game has been sort of quietly pretty good without the results to really show for it.” This marks a pretty sharp turnaround. Last year, including at the Masters, McIlroy was clearly caught in a state of technical flux. “I feel good with where my golf swing is,” he said. “I’m not overanalysing it, not looking at the video too much and it feels pretty good. The ball is basically doing what I want it to do more times than not. That’s a good thing.” Collin Morikawa, the Open champion, was among those to laud McIlroy for his fourth round. Morikawa had the best view, as the 32-year-old’s playing partner. “He was phenomenal,” Morikawa said. “I have always admired Rory’s game, it is completely different to mine. I think he drove it 380 yards at the 2nd.” If McIlroy must rue the wait of 51 weeks before an Augusta return, he is correct to be upbeat for the remainder of 2022. The Open Championship at St Andrews, a venue he adores, is on the horizon. He has no competitive experience at Southern Hills, which stages the US PGA Championship next month, but is typically fond of course setup in that major. Generally, if not exclusively, McIlroy has been hampered by slow starts in golf’s biggest four individual events. The last two he won, the USPGA and Open Championships of 2014, saw the Northern Irishman start with rounds of 66. “You try to come out of the blocks too fast, that’s when you can start to make mistakes, especially on golf courses that are as treacherous as Augusta or the places that we play in major championships,” McIlroy said. “It is nice to get off to good starts and be up the leaderboard early because I feel the earlier you get up there, almost the easier it is to stay there in some ways. But at the end of the day, you still have to bide your time and play your way in. I’ve always known that I can do it. I’ve played well enough around Augusta, maybe just haven’t strung four rounds together like this, but I’ve always known that I have the game to win. “I’ll have major championships where I’ll start fast and have chances, like the US Open last year and I’ll have things like this Masters where I’ll get off to a slow start. But there’s always a point in the tournament where you have a chance to make your move. It could be a third round or second round or whatever. At the end of the day we all have to play 72 holes and the 72nd hole is just as important as the first one. You just have to treat it like that.” It just so happens that McIlroy’s most recent 72nd hole delivered the kind of moment which proved he is no ordinary golfer.",Sport/Sport,Rory McIlroy’s magical Masters finish offers reminder of his star quality | Ewan Murray,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/rory-mcilroys-magical-masters-finish-offers-reminder-of-his-star-quality
4/12/2022,"The Queen avoided a dreaded case of lockdown hair during the early days of the pandemic after trusting her personal adviser and dresser with the royal tresses, it has emerged. Many commented on the monarch’s elegant coiffure during her TV addresses from Windsor Castle, where she was shielding, protected in “HMS Bubble”, made up from selected staff. Now, Angela Kelly, the Queen’s senior dresser, has described in an updated chapter to her book how she took on the role of hairdresser as well as her other duties as one of the staff who isolated with the Queen for periods. Her pandemic role included setting and cutting the monarch’s hair. Her revised book, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, first published in 2019, also covers the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral, the first public engagements post-lockdown, and looks ahead to the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations this June. Katya Shipster, the Harper NonFiction publishing director, said of the book: “It tells the story of the royal bubble as well as the lengths Angela and the royal household went to, to ensure the safety of the monarch.” Kelly, given permission by the Queen to write the book, has worked for the monarch for almost 30 years. She rarely gives interviews but she once disclosed: “We are two typical women. We discuss clothes, makeup, jewellery.” Her book reveals some of the behind-the-scenes tricks used for the monarch’s attire.She sews in extra layers of lining to cushion the impact of beading and crystals on the Queen’s back when events require glamorous gowns. Tiny weights are also put into day-wear hemlines in case of windy weather and fabrics that crumple or could develop messy loose strands are avoided. Kelly – who has the same size feet as the Queen – wears in the monarch’s handmade shoes to ensure they are comfortable when first used. The Queen is understood to have used the same London-based hairdresser for 23 years, who visits her at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. But, on occasions in the past, she was not averse to doing her own her hair, especially at Balmoral during her summer holidays.",News/UK news,Queen dodged lockdown hair by forming ‘HMS Bubble’ of selected staff,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/11/queen-dodged-lockdown-hair-by-forming-hms-bubble-of-selected-staff
4/12/2022,"Twitter’s chief executive knows this will not be the end of it. Announcing that Elon Musk will not join the company’s board, Parag Agrawal wrote: “There will be distractions ahead.” Interference is hard to avoid when one of your largest shareholders has more than 80 million followers on your platform and a penchant for impulsive use of the tweet button. Since it emerged last Monday that the world’s wealthiest person controls 9.2% of Twitter, Musk has lived up to his reputation for shoot-first-ask-later tweeting. In a stream of posts, some of which have been deleted, Musk flagged a number of potential changes to the platform. As is often the case with the Tesla chief executive, it was hard to separate visionary business guidance from mischief. Among the removed tweets was a suggestion that Twitter’s premium service should be made ad-free. This broached a commercially heretical path for a business that makes 90% of its annual revenue of $5bn (£3.8bn) from advertising. Musk’s justification for such a move was characteristically blunt: “The power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive.” As per Agrawal’s reference to distractions, just because Musk is no longer joining the Twitter board, it does not mean he will fade into the background. It is not Musk’s style, a point reinforced by his filings with the US financial watchdog related to the investment. He filed disclosure of his shareholding to the US Securities and Exchange Commission last Monday with a schedule 13G, which is for passive investors who are not preparing to shake up the business in question. The next day he refiled it as a schedule 13D, for investors who intend to take an active role. As a board member, Musk’s stake would have been capped at 14.9%, but not any more. He has since refiled the 13D, with an amendment flagging that he may express his views about the company “through social media”. Dan Ives, the managing director of the US investment firm Wedbush Securities, said he believed Twitter’s board and Musk could not reach an agreement over how the billionaire communicates with the public about the company, given that a board seat implies a more measured stance. “This now goes from a Cinderella story with Musk joining the Twitter board and keeping his stake under 14.9% helping move Twitter strategically forward to likely a ‘Game of Thrones’ battle between Musk and Twitter,” said Ives. He added that there was a “high likelihood” that Elon would take a more hostile stance towards Twitter and build his stake further. Twitter is used to activist investors at least, having negotiated a deal with the US investment firm Elliott Management in 2020 that included bringing in a new investor, the private equity firm Silver Lake, with both of them taking boardroom seats. Elliott retains a 1.25% stake in Twitter. It has also emerged that Vanguard, a US asset manager, is now Twitter’s biggest shareholder with a 10.3% stake, ending Musk’s brief reign as the biggest investor, although he remains the largest individual shareholder.The reaction of shareholders to Musk’s stake acquisition, and subsequent appointment to the board, indicated excitement over a potential shake-up, or sale of the $37bn company, as shares rose 17% last week. Twitter’s problems are longstanding and are focused on slow growth in both revenue and subscriber numbers. In its most recent quarterly results, revenue grew more slowly than expected, despite rising 22% to $1.6bn in the last three months of 2021. However, daily active users rose by 25 million over the year to 217 million as the company reiterated its goal of hitting 315 million of such users by the end of next year. One of Musk’s undeleted tweets over the past seven days reflected investors’ concerns over growth. Posting a list of Twitter’s top 10 accounts, which includes his own and is topped by Barack Obama, Musk said most of the accounts tweet rarely and post little content, adding: “Is Twitter dying?” Most of these “top” accounts tweet rarely and post very little content.Is Twitter dying? https://t.co/lj9rRXfDHE The reference to corporate mortality is typical Musk hyperbole, but he was voicing fears over growth that are thrown into stark relief by the march of rivals like TikTok. Mindful of competition and investor impatience, Twitter has been making changes over the past year. As well as exploring ways of making the site less confrontational, it has introduced new features like Twitter Blue, its $2.99-a-month premium service that gives users a 30 second window to edit tweets before they appear online. Blue is available in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Agrawal’s predecessor, Jack Dorsey, has also backed Musk’s call for Twitter users to be able to decide which algorithm they use to curate their experience on the platform, or to build their own. One of Musk’s notions last week was endorsed by the world’s second-wealthiest person, Jeff Bezos. The Amazon founder, responding to a subsequently deleted Musk poll asking whether Twitter should turn its HQ into a homeless shelter, tweeted a link to an article about a shelter on Amazon’s Seattle campus. Responding, Musk tweeted: “Great idea”. For one corporate governance expert, the main issue with Musk joining the Twitter board is time and the electric car company that he presides over. “He is running Tesla. He does not have time for Twitter. His job at Tesla is not an easy one and he is receiving enormous amounts of money to be there,” said Charles Elson, the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Musk is also the CEO of the space rocket company SpaceX. Elson added that Musk, Twitter account at the ready, would remain highly influential outside the boardroom regardless. “Frankly, he has just as much influence where he is.”",News/Technology,Musk unlikely to fade into background by not joining Twitter board,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/11/elon-musk-unlikely-to-fade-into-background-by-not-joining-twitter-board
4/12/2022,"On 11 April 1972 at 12.25pm, between a You and Yours discussion on “What’s new in playground equipment” and a World at One report on Labour party turmoil over the Common Market referendum, BBC Radio 4 launched a comedy game show. The chairman, jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton, was an unusual choice, and he seemed appalled by the format, testily setting the length of one contest at “two minutes, or as long as I can stand it”. Rounds included team members being required to sing Three Blind Mice to the tune of Old Man River; other challenges included improvising rhyming lines. After 30 minutes, the doleful host declared that the first show had come to a “merciful end”. Fifty years on, I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue is still in the same slot. The chair seems equally desperate to be elsewhere, although he is now Jack Dee. And the show is such a broadcasting institution that its half-century edition will be recorded at the Royal Albert Hall. Graeme Garden, who devised the show, is surprised by its longevity. “I sometimes say that Clue went on three years too long,” he says. “But it was the first three.” That Lyttelton did another 43 runs of a show marking five decades on air is due, Garden believes, to a change to its initial, completely improvised, approach which was “a bit too casual”. Producers Paul Mayhew-Archer (1982-86) and Jon Naismith – showrunner since 1991 – are generally credited with making Clue a super-format by introducing tight scripts that were a trampoline for ad-libs. It’s an approach that has captured in the show’s single most celebrated one-liner. On 4 February 2010, during a round of Uxbridge English Dictionary – in which new definitions are given to old words – Stephen Fry offered: “Countryside – to kill Piers Morgan.” Radio 4 broadcasters are discouraged from saying even “the C-word”, in case child listeners ask adults to spell the word out. But, at 12.52 on a Thursday afternoon, a Radio 4 punchline landed the most taboo word in broadcasting – using Clue’s signature trick of blue-chip filth where the rudeness isn’t visible on the script, but is made audible in the delivery. “We’ve always tried to do the show,” says Garden, “as if there were quite a severe BBC censor still in existence and we were obliged to get in the dirty jokes through innuendo rather than saying the words directly. Because then you can say, if you think that’s dirty, that’s your mind – not our words.” Many ingenious puns involve Samantha, the show’s imaginary scorer, to whose private life Lyttelton would allude. After “countryside”, the second most legendary piece of smut is probably a report of Samantha’s visit to a gastropub where “she didn’t fancy the landlord’s sausage but said she’d really like his tongue in cider”. Mayhew-Archer’s view is that “we were able to get away with jokes in Clue that other shows couldn’t because Graeme and Tim [Brooke-Taylor of The Goodies] and the others were revered. But I think there was also a sense that, as Humph was saying this stuff, it couldn’t possibly be as rude as it sounded because he was so respectable.” While the show’s inventive innuendo is one of its great attractions for fans, the jokes are considered too rude or sexist for some. Garden remembers: “We had one complaint about Samantha, which the BBC took incredibly seriously and promised she would be removed from the premises. Which we thought was incredibly unfair, as no one else had ever complained. Also, Samantha was usually the instigator of these alleged events – she was never taken advantage of – and also, finally, she didn’t exist.” The matter was eventually settled by alternating her duties with Sven, an equally libidinous male. Accusations of homophobia resulted from a running gag, straddling two centuries, about Lionel Blair, dancer and host of ITV’s charades-based game show Give Us a Clue. Although Blair was heterosexual, his camp manner and balletic skills seeded a game of radio mime in which the punchlines alluded to gay sex. How did Blair take this weekly misrepresentation of his sexuality? Garden says: “He told Barry Cryer that he loved those jokes; he relished the publicity. But there was a later communication that his wife and family were upset and would the BBC calm us down a bit. So I think the BBC leaned on us. But that was not long before he died [in 2021].” Perhaps encouraging complaints about “schoolboy” humour was the fact that – despite the early inclusion of Jo Kendall – the stand-out panellists were for a long time blokes. Fortunately, this changed over the years, with the introduction of regular female guests including Victoria Wood (who had been identified as a future mainstay before she died at 62). One of the first women to, as the show might put it, hold her own was Jan Ravens. “It was like being at the golf club,” she says. “I was aware, when I started Clue, that it was a case of: ‘We’d better get some women on,’ but there was no sense of making me feel unwelcome or awkward. I think the Clue boys were quite pleased to have fresh people in.” One of the series’ other crucial personnel is Colin Sell – the resident pianist since being recruited as a student in 1975. He is key to the 50-year-old round One Song to the Tune of Another, whose highlights include performances such as Rob Brydon singing the theme from Spider-Man to Bring Him Home from Les Misérables, and the heroic tone-deafness of Jeremy Hardy. “We go through the songs once in rehearsal,” says Sell, “so I can change key and pick up their pace. But one practice still makes it a bit of a wall of death. With Jeremy, the reason he was so bad was that he had never sung in public. After he did a few of the stage tours, he started to sing in tune, which rather spoiled the effect. So I’d rehearse it one key and then, in the recording, put it up a bit higher to throw him.” Across the 50 years, the series has only twice seemed close to ending. In 2005, when Garden and Naismith made plans for the first live tour (partly to supplement the paltry Radio 4 fees), the BBC tried to stop them, claiming copyright – until legal advice said that neither the BBC nor Garden owned the show, which was “not a format, but a series of formats”. During that dispute, the issue of low pay was also raised. Garden recalls a meeting with then BBC director general, Mark Thompson, at which Thompson cried: “Double everyone’s pay!” Fees have remained unchanged since, say insiders. Naismith recalls the regulars saying that they would “carry on until Humph goes” and, after Lyttelton’s death in 2008, the recording of series 51 was cancelled. “But then the BBC got in touch with Jon Naismith,” remembers Sell, “and said emails were flooding in from listeners who needed it back.” Now, with Dee having replaced Lyttleton – owing to a similar audible reluctance to be there in the chair – the only threat to the show might be an increase in censorship, which could lead to Samantha and others being fingered by Radio 4 bosses. For his first 17 years as producer, says Naismith, he “was the only one to hear the show before it went out”. But, in 2008, after Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand broadcast an offensive phone call to the actor Andrew Sachs, the BBC introduced layers of “compliance management”. “Suddenly, we had all these people people listening over the shows,” says Naismith. “I found it very frustrating. Someone in middle management says: ‘I’m not so sure about this line,’ then someone else isn’t sure, either.” During the pandemic lockdowns, Clue was included in an emergency list of shows chosen by the then director general, Tony Hall, to “cheer people up”. After Naismith selected a dozen from the archives, he had “eight notes from management on things that had to be cut, and I’m pleased to say I successfully disputed all but one”. Clue also survived the technical challenge of lockdown recordings on Zoom. Sell, on his living-room piano, “could hear the panellists but, due to the time delay, they were singing half a bar behind. Then I thought, that’s what often happens in the recordings.” One of its new stars, Pippa Evans, remembers “a mad lockdown recording, where Barry Cryer kept taking his headphones off and we couldn’t get his attention. So me and Harry Hill wrote signs saying: ‘Barry!’ and held them up. Eventually we had to call Barry’s son to call Barry’s wife and tell him to put his headphones back on.” Having got through a pandemic, the show may yet survive, in some form, an even greater global catastrophe. “Someone told me,” says Garden, “that the BBC has a vault of programmes to be played in the case of nuclear war and Clue is among them.” So the last thing Britons ever hear may be ingenious innuendo about Piers Morgan or Samantha? “Yes. But we wouldn’t get the repeat fees.” 50 Years Without a Clue is on Radio 4 and BBC Sounds on 16 April at 8pm",Arts/Television & radio,"I’m Sorry, I [Still] Haven’t a Clue … how radio’s smuttiest show has beaten the censors for 50 years",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/11/im-sorry-i-havent-a-clue-how-radio-smuttiest-show-bbc-50-years
4/12/2022,"The Scottish architect planner Sandy Bannerman, who has died aged 94, devoted almost all his long career to the UK’s new towns. His most important role was as chief architect planner to the Craigavon Development Commission, charged with creating a new city in Northern Ireland in the mid-1960s. Great Britain was transformed in the 50s by new housing, schools and even new towns, yet little had changed in Northern Ireland. Terence O’Neill, the moderate unionist prime minister appointed in 1963, saw modern planning as a means of levelling up the disparate community and introducing new industries. With unemployment four times that in Scotland and a faster rising population, already in 1960 the Stormont administration had commissioned a plan for the Belfast region. Robert Matthew, architect of the Royal Festival Hall in London, had worked on a similar plan for Glasgow in 1945, and now was called upon as a consultant to Stormont. He proposed relieving Belfast’s slums and congestion by building a new city 25 miles to the south-west. Based around the towns of Lurgan and Portadown, with lush open spaces and a new motorway, it had a target population of 180,000 – larger than Derry and more than half that of Belfast. Unlike comparable new towns in the north of England and Wales, the area chosen was one of relative growth. What was termed “the rural city” was to be developed to the highest standards by leading planners and landscape architects. The scheme was expensive, and it involved the loss of prime agricultural land. But for O’Neill it represented the future – and a way of keeping out the local Labour party. The planners had to battle with sectarianism and entrenched interests in an area that was predominantly Protestant. Nevertheless, the ambitions to give people decent homes and greater opportunities, based on decent planning, was genuinely meant. The detail of this plan was indebted to Bannerman. Then, in August 1964, the initial master planner, Geoffrey Copcutt, sent an explosive open letter of resignation to the government and regional newspapers, having concluded that the project should be abandoned in favour of developing Belfast, Derry and other existing towns. Traditionalists who also opposed the new city were barely appeased by its controversial naming in January 1965 after Stormont’s first prime minister, Lord (James) Craigavon. As head of the design team, Bannerman kept going, laying out separate routes for pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles – leading Craigavon to be lampooned for its many roundabouts, as later was Milton Keynes. The landscaping, exploiting views across Lough Neagh, included three new lakes and a park around the restored Georgian house of Tannaghmore. Work began on a new neighbourhood, Brownlow, intended to be of similar size to Portadown and Lurgan, a new city centre and standardised factories. Goodyear, the tyre manufacturers, moved in. Then came the Troubles, leading to the collapse of devolved government in 1972 and the winding up of Craigavon Development Commission in 1973, rampant inflation and a decline in the birth rate. Emigration soared. Brownlow had seen the building of 2,500 new homes by 1971, mostly on a Radburn plan (based on a US design that originated in Radburn, New Jersey), with narrow pedestrian alleys that attracted vandalism, and the speed of building caused later problems. Most of this early housing has been demolished. Yet the last 15 years has seen Craigavon’s revival, with new housing and facilities provided by the private sector based on the infrastructure laid out by Bannerman and his team. In 2016 and 2017 it was voted the best place to live in Northern Ireland for its good work-life balance. The Brownlow area now houses around 20,000 people, as was initially intended, and the Goodyear factory (closed in 1983) has been repurposed for new businesses. Bannerman was born in Aberdeen, the son of Elizabeth (nee Strachan) and Alexander Bannerman, and named after his father, a meat salesman. He studied architecture at the city’s Gray’s School of Art and town planning at Glasgow School of Art. He epitomised a generation of architect planners who took ideas from one new town to the next. His first job was in Harlow, Essex, in 1956, producing schemes for the town park and sports facilities under the consultant architect Frederick Gibberd. He shared something of Gibberd’s commitment to architecture, planning and landscaping as an integrated whole, and like him emphasised the last of these. He moved on to East Kilbride and in 1957 to Cumbernauld, before in 1962 he joined Glasgow Corporation. Many of his colleagues there followed him to Craigavon in 1963. A meticulous and inspiring leader, Bannerman became director of the Craigavon Development Commission and, following its winding up in 1973, continued his work as its divisional planning officer under the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland. He was briefly a partner in private practice with WJ Cairns & Partners, from 1977 running its Northern Ireland office with responsibility for the satellite development of Poleglass near Lisburn. But the public sector won out when in 1980 he became chief architect to Glenrothes, one of the few new town development corporations to survive the Thatcher government’s stringent cuts. He retired in 1992 on its eventual closure, and pursued hobbies of fly fishing, gardening and golf. After his first wife, Elizabeth (nee Johnstone), died suddenly, leaving him with two small daughters, Claire and Anne, he moved to Cumbernauld in 1957, where he met and married Maureen Thorburn, with whom he had a son, John. Maureen died in 2017. His children survive him, as do six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.

4/12/2022,"A Manchester United fans group is planning a fresh protest against the club’s owners, the Glazer family, when Ralf Rangnick’s side host Norwich City on Saturday and have promised it will not turn into “another Liverpool”. The 1958 group posted details on social media, with supporters due to meet at the Tollgate hostelry in Stretford at 11am before marching to Old Trafford at 2pm. Those involved asked not to attend the game until 3.17pm – a minute for each year the Glazers have been proprietors. The planned demonstration on Saturday comes after the renewed protests last year towards the American family, which were reignited by United’s membership of the failed European Super League. Liverpool’s visit to United on 2 May was called off after planned peaceful protests spilled into chaotic scenes as fans broke into the stadium and violence ensued. Those organising the event on Saturday said: “This isn’t another Liverpool – we believe this was a one-off unique event. This is the start of constant, relentless, legal and peaceful protests and actions against our owners. We know the challenges ahead of us and we will not waver or detract from these goals. Bring your colours, banners, flags and flares. We need you – we need each other, we need everyone to put aside their differences. Some things are worth fighting for.” Last year supporters also launched a digital campaign to apply pressure on United’s commercial partners, including a threat to boycott. This caused the club to lose a £200m training kit sponsorship deal with the Hut Group after the local-based company pulled out. After the Liverpool protest, Joel Glazer announced a fans share scheme as one of the initiatives to try to assuage supporters. Yet nearly a year later, there is no guarantee that will go ahead. Malcolm Glazer bought United in 2005 and used a leveraged method that loaded a £525m debt on the club, with close to the same amount remaining as of December 2021. When Glazer died in 2014 his six children inherited the club – two of them, Joel and Avram, are co-chairmen.

4/12/2022,"The Fiver is all about self-improvement and finds itself incapable of watching a football match without learning the now traditional “five things”. While we already knew that Manchester City and Liverpool were both quite good at football, Sunday’s ding-dong at least served to reinforce that view, even if Liverpool were uncharacteristically poor in the first half before getting what one assumes was a gegen-rocket up the collective backside from Jürgen Klopp at the break. What we learned from one of the post-match interviews is that (1) Kevin De Bruyne knows Virgil van Dijk, (2) that the Manchester City midfielder sees Virgil a lot, (3) that his and Virgil’s children attend the same school and (4) like to play together which (5) provided the background for their “friendly chat” on the final whistle. These revelations that elite, gifted footballers aren’t actually kept cryogenically frozen in chambers only to be thawed out for training and matches appear to have come as a shock to many viewers, who had no idea that the existence of top athletes can be as mundane, if not more crushingly dull than those lived by the rest of us. Or that both men live in Cheshire, hence the pow-wows on the school run. It also went some way towards explaining why Pep Guardiola went full Basil Fawlty – without a trace of irony or awareness – when Van Dijk clipped De Bruyne to bring him down with a technical foul that could not have been more ‘Fernandinho’ if it had a shaved head, was sporting a big 25 on its back and was dancing the samba through Londrina’s main drag. Despite his anger, Pep was all smiles after the game as he and his opposite number Jürgen Klopp wrapped each other in a warm and tight embrace. With ne’er a flying pizza slice, an angry finger-wagging Irishman or a 22-man stramash involving a variety of fists and boots emerging from a cartoon cloud it has become abundantly clear that the rivalry between Liverpool and Manchester City is sadly lacking in the kind of sneering mutual contempt, childish needle and belligerent rancour that powers all the most entertaining feuds. Following a weekend in which Neil Warnock announced his retirement from management, perhaps one or both clubs could bring him in as an anger-management consultant to help generate some much-needed animosity. “Not fun, it really wasn’t fun.

4/12/2022,"Downing Street has condemned the “guerrilla tactics” of protesters who have blockaded fuel distribution terminals, as reports of shortages at petrol station forecourts spread and figures showed a fall in fuel deliveries. Supporters of the Just Stop Oil campaign have taken action at 11 different fuel terminals in England since the start of the month, blockading and trespassing on sites to stop tankers entering, filling up or leaving to deliver fuel. Petrol retailers say that the protests are not having a serious impact on deliveries. But there have been dozens of local reports of petrol pumps running dry and Priti Patel, the home secretary, said “people across the country [were] seeing their lives brought to a standstill” by disruption caused by the campaign. The protesters have vowed to continue taking action until the government agrees on a ban on all new fossil fuel projects. On Monday afternoon, their 11th day of action, several were entering their 31st hour chained to pipework at Inter Terminal in Grays, Essex, the third largest terminal in the country. “We’re doing this because our government is refusing to act on the climate crisis and we need to have a meaningful statement that we will have no new fossil fuel projects, it’s that simple,” said an activist, who gave his name as Nathan, in a video filmed from above the loading bay at the terminal and published on Twitter. Responding to the protests on Monday, a No 10 spokeswoman said: “We recognise the strength of feeling and the right to protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, but we won’t tolerate guerrilla tactics that obstruct people going about their day-to-day business.” She added: “We fully support the police who are putting significant resource into their response to the demonstrations.” Labour called for injunctions to ban the protests. Labour’s Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, said: “Tory ministers need to get on with their jobs. Motorists were already being hammered by prices at the pump, and now millions can’t even access fuel. This is all happening on the government’s watch. They need to sort it out.” Any injunctions would in fact need to be obtained by the operators of fuel terminals rather than the government. One interim injunction, banning protests around the Kingsbury oil terminal in the Midlands, had a return hearing at the high court on Monday. The decision on the injunction taken out by Valero Energy against persons unknown was reserved – meaning it will come later – according to a spokesman for the corporate lawyers Shoosmiths. Retailers insisted the protests were not having a major impact. Sainsbury’s said it was monitoring the situation, but that all its petrol stations continued to receive deliveries. Morrisons said it supported comments by the British Retail Consortium, whose director of food and sustainability, Andrew Opie, said: “Retailers are adept at dealing with disruption and will do everything they can to ensure their customers can continue to fill up their vehicles as usual.” A spokesman for the UK Petroleum Industry Association played down the effect that protests were having. “Fuels continue to be delivered, meaning stocks are being replenished,” he said. “The ongoing protest activity is affecting some deliveries but disruptions are localised and short-term only. The industry is working hard to ensure fuels are being delivered as quickly as possible.” Local news reports continued to emerge of shortages in various different parts of the country, including Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire and Staffordshire, among other places. The first shortages were reported in Kent and Warwickshire as early as 3 April – just two days after activists began taking action. On Sunday, Fair Fuels UK, which campaigns for cheaper petrol, claimed on Twitter it had “credible intelligence” that one in three pumps were running dry – a claim it quickly reversed after a call from the government. On Monday Tom Hunt, the MP for Ipswich, said he had had to visit six petrol stations before he was able to refuel his car. “The situation in Ipswich seems to be slightly better than in rural Suffolk, which I was driving through this morning,” he was quoted as saying by the Ipswich Star. “This is largely linked to the selfish behaviour of activists linked to Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil who have been holding up fuel supplies and blocking crucial depots in the region.” He added: “The activists in question must not be allowed to do this and to get away with it. I know a number have been arrested but in my view they should immediately be rounded up and severely punished for the immense disruption they are causing.” Data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, covering the first few days of the campaign, showed that deliveries to petrol stations began falling as the protests took hold, while forecourt reserves appear to be dwindling. In the three days after the protests began, average daily deliveries were estimated at 33,766 litres per filling station, down by more than a fifth from 43,243 the week before. The drop-off was even more pronounced in regions served by terminals that were targeted by protesters, with deliveries down 43% in the West Midlands, 44% in London and 48% in the east. Fuel stock levels at forecourts in affected areas tailed off, with the fall particularly acute in London, where the average forecourt was 28% full on 3 April, down from 40% before the protests began. New figures, which will show any impact after 3 April, are due to be published later this week. Just Stop Oil’s coordinators said they had counted 880 arrests by Sunday evening. They said about 400 people had taken part in the campaign so far, and new recruits continued to join. They have vowed to continue their campaign.",News/Environment,No 10 condemns ‘guerrilla tactics’ as Just Stop Oil activists block fuel depots,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/11/no-10-condemns-guerrilla-tactics-of-just-stop-oil-blocking-fuel-deliveries
4/12/2022,"Boris Johnson has joined MPs and others in paying tribute to Sir David Amess, with several stressing the importance of focusing on the Conservative backbencher’s life and work rather than the deeds of his murderer. In a tweeted statement, Johnson called Amess, who was killed last October by Ali Harbi Ali in an Islamist-inspired terrorist attack, “a beloved colleague, public servant and friend who championed the city of Southend in everything he did”, saying his thoughts were with Amess’s family. Ali was convicted at the Old Bailey on Monday of the terrorist assassination of Amess and is due to be sentenced on Wednesday. The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said that after a distressing trial, the verdict “gives an opportunity to reflect on David’s legacy – as a man devoted to his family, to parliament and his Southend West constituency”. Hoyle added: “He was well liked by all and during his almost four decades as an MP he built a reputation for kindness and generosity.” Responding to the verdict, the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, tweeted: “Good. Justice delivered though we will never have Sir David back.” Brendan Cox, the widower of Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered by a far-right terrorist in 2016, said Ali’s actions would achieve nothing. “Like the killing of Jo, all it has achieved politically has been to allow millions of people to learn about David’s decency and the causes he cared about,” Cox sad. “The terrorist will rot in jail and die in ignominy. David’s name will be remembered, especially by the people of Southend who he served. “Terrorists may cite different ideologies. But what unites them is their desire for infamy, their cowardly attacks on the unarmed and the total failure to advance their cause.” The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, added to the tributes, calling Amess “a champion of Southend and of his constituents”. He added: “Threats to our democracy will never prevail.” Priti Patel, the home secretary and a fellow Essex MP, said Amess had been “a kind, compassionate and loyal colleague”. She tweeted: “Today I am thinking of my dear friend Sir David Amess. My thoughts are with him, his family and the people of Southend, a place he devoted his life to serving. He represented the best values of our parliamentary democracy.” Amess, 69, who had four daughters and a son with his widow, Julia, was a long-serving MP and perpetual backbencher, being first elected for Basildon in 1983 and then for Southend West in 1997. He campaigned passionately on a number of issues, including animal rights and endometriosis, and had pushed – over many years – for Southend to be made a city, something that eventually happened at the start of March. The change to Southend’s status, officially marked with a visit by Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, was made swiftly after Amess’s death in tribute to him. While Amess had some fairly robust rightwing views – he was a staunch Eurosceptic and, as a devout Catholic, opposed abortion rights – he was also happy to work with MPs from other parties, a number of whom paid tribute after the verdict. “Thinking this afternoon about the kindness of David Amess, rather than the hatred of his killer, and sending love to his family, friends and loved ones,” tweeted Labour’s Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary.",News/Politics,Prime minister pays tribute to Sir David Amess after killer convicted,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/prime-minister-pays-tribute-to-sir-david-amess-after-killer-convicted
