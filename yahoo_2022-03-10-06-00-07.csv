3/10/2022,"Half measures are for the half-hearted. If President Biden and other democratic leaders around the world are really going to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his brutal invasion of Ukraine, then it’s time to apply the muscle needed to clip his power permanently and smash his ability to wreak destruction wherever he chooses. The way to corral Putin is with robust energy sanctions that will raise prices even more and cause genuine hardship for millions outside of Russia—but pay off in the end. That should be combined with resolute but careful military support, including covert aid. Biden and the leaders of allied nations in Europe, Asia and elsewhere will have to explain coming sacrifices to their people and find ways to rally them if success isn’t quick. Military hawks want the NATO military alliance to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine and confront Russian forces militarily. This is unclever and dangerous and likely to be backfire. Armchair generals should read up on what it takes to establish a no-fly zone over a country the size of Texas. It would be a massive mobilization almost certainly involving losses of NATO aircraft and personnel Russia would be able to target with stand-off weapons. It would also require NATO airstrikes inside Russian territory, to disable air-defense systems that reach into Ukraine. That would give Putin exactly the justification he’s looking for to characterize his demonic jihad as a reaction to NATO aggression. It would also give him the pretext for using tactical nuclear weapons, if he’s willing to go that far. It's easy to understand why Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky continually asks NATO to establish a no-fly zone to limit the Russian bombs and missiles killing civilians and wrecking schools, hospitals, apartment buildings and government offices. But Zelensky must know NATO is not going to do this, since every Western leader commenting on the idea has ruled it out. It’s possible this is a deliberate feint, of sorts: Zelensky keeps asking for an escalation that would undoubtedly trigger Putin, while NATO and other friendly nations keep saying no, while slipping Ukraine other types of military aid that’s a little less escalatory. Know-it-all war commentators should keep in mind there’s always stuff going on behind the scenes during a military conflict. Several nations, including the United States, are rushing defensive weapons into Ukraine, including missiles able to destroy tanks and aircraft. Turkey is sending armed drones that already seem to have helped take out scores of Russian vehicles. This should continue as long as necessary. Ukraine’s own army has so far shown remarkable resolve and more capability than most analysts expected. Build on that for as long as it takes. [Follow Rick Newman on Twitter, sign up for his newsletter or send in your thoughts.] Russia, meanwhile, has revealed some major weaknesses that must alarm Putin, if he’s sane. The most startling is a creaky army that can’t get the job done. Battlefield reports should always be viewed skeptically, yet there seem to be numerous instances in which the long Russia army columns heading toward the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and other cities are stuck for lack of fuel, food and spare parts. Some captured Russian conscripts say they thought they were going to training exercises rather than invading a neighboring country. The mark of a professional military isn’t fancy weapons that shine in parades. It’s logistical competence under stress and discipline among troops who know what the mission is. Russia still has massive amounts of firepower in Ukraine and select units of elite troops, and could regroup. But some of its weaknesses are astonishing. Tanks seem reluctant to leave blacktop roads, for instance, as if they fear bogging down in mud. That makes thousands of Russian vehicles in stalled convoys sitting ducks for any weapon that can get to them. Russia could shut down digital and communication networks in Ukraine, but it hasn’t, possibly because it needs them for its own battlefield communications. Vulnerabilities seem to be everywhere. Putin supposedly rebuilt this force from the tattered remnants of the Soviet Union’s Red Army, financing it with billions in revenue every year from oil and gas sales to the rest of the world. Yet everybody knows Russia is a kleptocracy with officials and businessmen at every level, from Putin on down, siphoning off as much national wealth as they can get for themselves. This story is incomplete, but it now seems corruption and graft have left Putin with a hollow army. Put to the test, it’s turning out to be a flabby spear for Putin to attack his neighbors with. This is the army Putin built with his nation participating fully in the world’s oil and gas markets. So imagine how feeble it would become if Putin lost access to that money, in a sustained way that left him nowhere to turn, not even to his fellow dictators in China. This is where the United States and Europe are heading, and they should inflict maximum financial pain on Putin now that he has shown these glaring vulnerabilities. On March 8, Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil and natural gas, with the apparent blessing of Congress. The United States doesn’t buy much Russian energy, and this won’t hurt Putin much. But Biden has set the tone for other nations that need Russian energy a lot more to pass their own bans or at least cut back on Russian energy purchases. On the same day, the United Kingdom said it would phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022, and the European Union said it planned to cut purchases of Russian gas by two-thirds in the same time frame. By 2030, the EU said, it planned to completely end its reliance on Russian gas. Europe buys far more Russian energy than the United States does, and losing Europe as a customer would be crushing to Russia. It will also be hard on Europeans, whose energy bills are already way higher than those in America. They will go higher still. While government sanctions are beginning to squeeze Putin’s war financing, so is the market. Many private-sector purchasers of Russian energy now can’t buy it even if they want to, because sanctions on the financial system make purchase transactions difficult or impossible. Until now, Russia’s giant energy firms have been reliable business partners delivering their product almost regardless of what else is going on. But Putin has wrecked that, too. “Russia has proved it’s not a reliable business partner,” Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, said in a March 8 call with clients. “Even if there’s some conclusion to the war, there will be some desire to limit exposure to Russia.” Putin and the oligarchs dependent on him for their wealth will seek every possible way to evade sanctions. They’ll find some holes, for sure. This is where Europe and the United States and other allied nations must now make it a strategic, long-term national-security priority to boycott Russian energy for as long as Putin remains in power. Anybody who ever doubted that Putin is a bully undeterred by diplomacy can now see plainly that he will murder civilians and destroy nations to fulfill his egomaniacal ambition as long as he has the power to do so. His missteps in Ukraine now reveal how to torpedo that power. Let Putin continue to rule Russia. Regime change in Russia should not be a public or secret goal of any Western nation. If Putin’s enemies in the Kremlin want to give assassination a shot, that’s their business. But the clear goal of the United States and the full slate of other nations confronting Russia should be the surrender of Ukraine back to Ukrainians, the diminution of Russian military power and a lock on the ATM that enriches Putin and his minions. Putin can have whatever is left after that.

What they're saying: ""It is our belief, as leaders of the Colorado Republican Party, that any Republican candidate who is indicted with felonies by a grand jury and who will be charged by a Republican district attorney should suspend their campaign while they undergo the legal challenges associated with those indictments,"" the statement reads. Why it matters: The criminal charges against Peters, who is favored by supporters of former President Trump, threatens to upend the GOP's chances in a key race and spoil its broader message.

A spokesperson for Lada's parent company AvtoVAZ said the company had planned to halt production until March 11 due to the global chip shortage; he did not comment on the sanctions. It's just the latest disruption for a Russian economy ""beginning to feel the bite of sanctions the West imposed on Moscow"" after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, the Journal reports.

3/10/2022,"Pfizer's CEO said he had a ""heated"" debate with Jared Kushner over COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Albert Bourla said he told Kushner the US would have to wait its turn to get 100 million more doses. He said Kushner disagreed, telling him the US government could ""take measures"" to enforce its will. Pfizer's CEO, Albert Bourla, said in a book excerpt published by Forbes on Monday that he and Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, once had a ""heated"" debate over whether the US should receive additional COVID-19 vaccine doses first. Bourla said he and Kushner, who in the early days of the pandemic was the head of a COVID-19 shadow task force, disagreed over the timeline to supply the additional 100 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine that the Trump administration had ordered. Bourla wrote that the conflict arose because the US was topping up on its original order of 100 million doses, but other countries had already signed contracts with Pfizer to secure their vaccine doses. ""Jared was asking for a very aggressive delivery plan to the U.S. for the additional 100 million doses. He wanted it all in the second quarter of 2021,"" Bourla wrote. ""To do that, we would have had to take supplies from Canada, Japan, and Latin American countries, all of which had placed their orders earlier than the U.S. and were expecting the vaccine in the second quarter."" Bourla said the debate ""became heated"" when he refused. He said he reminded Kushner that he had made it clear to Moncef Slaoui, the chief advisor to the Trump team's vaccine-development program, that Pfizer would not take doses from other countries to give them to the US. However, Kushner ""didn't budge,"" Bourla said. ""In his mind, America was coming first no matter what. In my mind, fairness had to come first,"" Bourla wrote, adding, ""He reminded me that he represented the government, and they could 'take measures' to enforce their will."" Bourla wrote that he responded to Kushner: ""Be my guest, Jared. I prefer to have Japan's prime minister complaining to you about the cancellation of the Olympics rather than to me."" The CEO said the disagreement ended when Pfizer's manufacturing team told him its schedule would allow it to deliver the extra doses to the US without cutting the supply to other countries. ""Jared called me two days later from Mar-a-Lago to thank me for the collaboration, and we closed the loop on a happy note,"" Bourla wrote.

3/10/2022,"(Updates with Blinken quotes, details, background) By Humeyra Pamuk and Daphne Psaledakis WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected every off-ramp offered by the United States to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine and has, on the contrary, stepped up his military campaign, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. ""We've sought to provide possible off-ramps to President Putin. He's the only one who can decide whether or not to take them. So far, every time there's been an opportunity to do just that, he's pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he's been pursuing,"" Blinken said at a joint news conference with his British counterpart Liz Truss. ""He has a clear plan right now to brutalize Ukraine but to what end?"" Blinken said, adding that Ukrainians have shown that they would not accept any ""puppet regime"" that Putin might try to install to replace the elected Ukrainian government. ""If he tries to enforce such a puppet regime by keeping Russian forces in Ukraine, it will be a long, bloody, drawn-out mess,"" Blinken said. Senior U.S. defense officials last month assessed that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is designed to 'decapitate' Ukraine's government. More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin launched the land, sea and air invasion on Feb 24. Moscow calls its action a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbor and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis."" The war has swiftly cast Russia into economic isolation as well as drawing almost universal international condemnation. The United States on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil, while Western companies are rapidly pulling out of the Russian market. Russian forces hold territory stretching along Ukraine's northeast border, the east and the southeast. Fighting has taken place in the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, while Ukraine's second city Kharkiv is under bombardment. Blinken has also slammed Russia for not allowing safe passage to civilians stuck in cities under heavy bombardment. ""The Kremlin's proposals to create humanitarian corridors leading into Russia and Belarus are absurd,"" he said. Russia earlier this week had offered Ukrainians escape routes to Russia and its close ally Belarus, a proposal that a spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said was ""completely immoral.""

3/10/2022,"By Patricia Zengerle, Jonathan Landay and Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of U.S. spy agencies said on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin may intensify the assault on Ukraine despite military setbacks and economic hardships resulting from international sanctions, setting up ""an ugly next few weeks."" They estimated that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops had died and said Russia was feeling the effects of sanctions, but the situation could become much worse for Ukrainians, with food and water supplies in Kyiv possibly running out within two weeks. ""Our analysts assess that Putin is unlikely to be deterred by such setbacks and instead may escalate,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the annual House of Representatives Intelligence Committee hearing on worldwide threats, where she testified with other intelligence agency directors. Haines said Putin's announcement that he was elevating his nuclear forces' readiness was ""extremely unusual"" since the 1960s, but that intelligence analysts had not observed changes in Russia's nuclear posture beyond what was detected during previous international crises. ""We also have not observed force-wide nuclear posture changes that go beyond what we've seen in prior moments of heightened tensions,"" Haines said. William Burns, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, echoed Haines' assessment that Russia is unlikely to back down. ""I think Putin is angry and frustrated right now. He's likely to double down and try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns said. Burns said he and CIA analysts do not see how Putin can accomplish his goal of taking Kyiv and replacing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government with a pro-Moscow or puppet leadership. ""I fail to see how he can produce that kind of an end game and where that leads, I think, is for an ugly next few weeks in which he doubles down ... with scant regard for civilian casualties,"" Burns told the committee. 'DESPERATE' IN KYIV Given reports that Russia is cutting off basic supplies to Kyiv, home to 2.8 million people, Lieutenant General Scott Berrier, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, said the situation in Ukraine's capital could worsen quickly. ""I don't have a specific number of days of supply that the population has. But with supplies being cut off, it will be somewhat desperate in, I would say, 10 days to two weeks,"" Berrier said. Berrier said the United States did not have evidence that Russia had committed war crimes beyond what has appeared on social media. Berrier said that ""the bombing of schools and facilities that are not associated with the Ukrainian military certainly would indicate that he is stepping up right to the line if he hasn't done so already."" Burns said China's leaders are ""unsettled"" by events surrounding the assault on Ukraine, despite refusing to condemn Russia or call the attack an invasion. ""They did not anticipate the significant difficulties the Russians were going to run into. I think they are unsettled by the reputational damage that can come by their close association with President Putin; second by the economic consequences at a moment when they are facing lower annual growth rates than they've experienced for more than three decades,"" Burns added. ""I think they're a little bit unsettled about the impact on the global economy. And third, I think they're a little bit unsettled by the way in which Vladimir Putin has driven Europeans and Americans much closer together,"" Burns said. The United States has done ""intensive intelligence-sharing"" with Ukraine, Burns said. Berrier said his ""low confidence"" assessment was that 2,000 to 4,000 Russian troops have been killed. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbor's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. At the hearing, Democratic and Republican committee members praised the work done by the U.S. intelligence community ahead of the Russian invasion.

3/10/2022,"When Russia put out a long list of “unfriendly countries,” singling out those that have punished it for invading Ukraine, the regime didn’t include any Latin American states. Latin American countries should be ashamed. The list, released on March 7, mentioned the United States, the 27 countries of the European Union, Britain, Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland. I can’t help but wonder whether Latin America’s response to the invasion of Ukraine was so weak that Russia’s autocrat Vladimir Putin considers countries in the region to still be friendly. To be fair, most Latin American countries joined the overwhelming 141 majority vote that condemned Russia’s invasion at a United Nations General Assembly on March 1. Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, El Salvador and Nicaragua abstained, and Venezuela didn’t vote. But the leaders of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina have made wishy-washy statements that seem to contradict their countries’ votes at the United Nations. Worse, virtually all Latin American countries have bucked the democratic world’s massive offensive to impose sanctions on Russia for the worst aggression against a sovereign and democratic European state in recent memory. While the United States, the European Union — and even formerly neutral countries Switzerland and Sweden — not only are imposing economic sanctions, but also sending arms to Ukraine, most Latin American presidents are not even willing to impose symbolic sanctions against the Putin regime. Most, like Mexico, have invoked their countries’ laws that supposedly prohibit them from imposing unilateral sanctions on other countries without a U.N. mandate. But in virtually all cases, that’s a misleading argument. Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador claims that Mexico is a “pacifist” country and will not impose sanctions on any other. Mexican officials say that their country has never imposed unilateral sanctions against any country without a U.N. resolution. But that’s not true. In World War II, Mexico sent one of its elite air force squadrons to fight alongside U.S. and allied forces in the Philippines. In 1968, Mexico unilaterally banned apartheid South Africa from the Mexico City Olympics. In 1975, Mexico denied visas to South African tennis players who were headed to Mexico for a Davis Cup match. “Mexico has imposed unilateral sanctions at other times in the past, based on U.N. General Assembly resolutions,” says Jorge Lomónaco, a former Mexican ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and to the Organization of American States. “It could perfectly well do the same now, based on the March 1 U.N. General Assembly resolution.” It would be unrealistic to demand at this time that Mexico or any other Latin American country send troops or weapons to Ukraine. And, considering Latin America’s post-pandemic economic crisis, countries in the region could be excused for not imposing economic sanctions, even when Russia is a relatively minor trading partner for most of them. In Mexico’s case, it’s the country’s 36th export market. But, at a defining moment in world history, when the future of national sovereignty, democracy and fundamental rights is at stake like never before since World War II, Latin American countries should at least take symbolic steps to make it perfectly clear to Russia whose side they’re on. Symbolic sanctions are no minor issue. Most Russians, who are fed only Putin’s propaganda through state-controlled media, still believe that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “defensive” military operation against a foreign threat. And Putin’s list of “unfriendly” nations leads Russians to believe that most of the world — China and India, and Latin America and African countries — are on Putin’s side. Latin American leaders should send humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees with urgency and suspend all sports events with Russia, following the lead of FIFA World Soccer Federation, the International Tennis Federation and other major sports organizations, which have already done this. And they should vote at the Organization of American States, as a region, to stop all cultural-exchange agreements with Russia. They should announce all of these measures, loud and clear, to send a strong message to the Russian people that Putin has committed an atrocity. It’s time for Latin America to actively side with the world’s biggest democracies — and proudly take their place on Putin’s list of “unfriendly” nations.

3/10/2022,"The Russian ruble sank after the Moscow exchange reopened trading of the fiat currency. The ruble has lost almost 40% of its value so far this year and is sitting at historic lows. The Moscow exchange kept stock trading closed and stopped the trading of foreign currencies. The Russian ruble sank after Moscow's exchange reopened it for trading Wednesday following a pause amid the war in Ukraine. The Moscow exchange closed ruble trading Friday as sanctions from the West — brought on by Putin's forces attacking Ukraine — hit Russia's economy, while offshore trading continued. Since the closure, more moves from the West have targeted Putin's economy, and Russians got their first chance this week to react when the exchange reopened ruble trading Wednesday. According to an early morning report from Bloomberg, the fiat currency sank 11% to 117.7 per dollar. The latest drop means the ruble has fallen nearly 40% so far this year, to historic lows, and is worth less than a penny. Even as Russia's central bank reopened currency trading, it kept the stock exchange closed for a second week and it stopped the sale of foreign currencies, Insider reported previously. Alongside new sanctions from the US targeting Russian oil, major companies like BP, Apple, and McDonald's are ending or suspending business in the country in response to its attack on Ukraine that began last month. Russia's economy has been crumbling in the face of tough sanctions that have targeted its economy and financial system. The sanctions have included freezing hundreds of billions of dollars worth of the central bank's foreign currency assets and blocking Russian banks from the SWIFT payments system.

3/10/2022,"By Steve Holland and Pavel Polityuk WASHINGTON/LVIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - A U.S. ban on imports of Russia's oil ratcheted up punishment for the invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday as McDonald's and Starbucks closed outlets and Moscow promised safe passage for some people to flee. As the number of refugees created by the biggest assault on a European country since World War Two surpassed 2 million, several of the most internationally famous brands added to the Kremlin's global isolation on the 13th day of the incursion. McDonald's, a symbol of capitalism that opened in Russia as the Soviet Union fell, and coffeehouse chain Starbucks will temporarily close stores, while Pepsi will stop selling its soft drink brands and Coca-Cola is halting business in the country. Washington, meanwhile, imposed an immediate ban on imports of Russian energy, sparking a further increase in the oil price, which rose around 4% on Tuesday. Prices have surged more than 30% since Russia's incursion began on Feb. 24. [O/R] Russia - the world's second-largest exporter of crude - has warned the cost will skyrocket further if the West implements bans. Despite the prospect of higher household bills, U.S. President Joe Biden said President Vladimir Putin needed to face consequences for the assault. ""The American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin's war machine,"" he said. The Kremlin describes its actions as a ""special operation"" to disarm Ukraine and unseat leaders it calls neo-Nazis. Ukraine and Western allies call this a baseless pretext for an invasion that has raised fears of wider conflict in Europe and could deal a further hit to the world economy as it tries to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Civilians fled the besieged city of Sumy on Tuesday in the first successful ""humanitarian corridor"" opened since Russia's invasion but Ukraine accused Russian forces of shelling another evacuation route, from Mariupol in the south of the country. Talks between Kyiv and Moscow over safe passage have previously failed, with Ukraine opposing routes out of the country to Russia or its ally Belarus. Moscow is ready to provide humanitarian corridors so people can leave capital Kyiv and four other cities - Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol - on Wednesday, Mikhail Mizintsev, head of Russia's National Defence Control Centre, was quoted as saying by the Tass news agency. ""In order to ensure the safety of civilians and foreign citizens, Russia will observe a regime of silence from 10 am Moscow time (0700 GMT) on March 9 and is ready to provide humanitarian corridors,"" he said. It was unclear if the proposed routes would pass through Russia or Belarus. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy renewed calls on Tuesday for no-fly zones, something the West has rejected for fears of escalating the conflict. The United States turned down a surprise Polish offer to transfer MiG-29 fighter jets to a U.S. base in Germany to help replenish Ukraine's air force. The prospect of flying combat aircraft from NATO territory into the war zone ""raises serious concerns for the entire NATO alliance,"" the Pentagon said. Instead, the West has focussed its pressure on sanctions, mainly on individuals and financial institutions. Up until now, oil and natural gas had been excluded. The United States is not a leading buyer of Russian oil and Europeans, who are far more reliant on it, have been reluctant to follow suit. Britain, however, said it would also phase out the import of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022, while the EU published plans to cut its reliance on Russian gas by two thirds this year. Vyacheslav Volodin, chairman of Russia's State Duma lower house of parliament, said the measures would hurt Europe while helping the United States. ""By promoting sanctions against Russian energy resources, Washington is seeking to occupy the European market,"" he said in an online post. 'APOCALYPTIC' In Mariupol, hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering under bombardment for more than a week. Many tried to leave on Tuesday along a safe corridor but Ukraine's foreign ministry said Russian forces violated a ceasefire and shelled it. Moscow denies targeting civilians. International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Ewan Watson said people in Mariupol were fast running out of electricity, heat, food, and drinking water. ""The situation in Mariupol is apocalyptic,"" he said. Russia opened a separate corridor out of the eastern city of Sumy. Buses left for Poltava further west, only hours after a Russian air strike which regional officials said had hit a residential area and killed 21 people. Reuters could not verify the incident. Russia said 723 people had been evacuated via that corridor, including 576 Indian nationals. Residents were also leaving Irpin, a frontline Kyiv suburb. Elsewhere, Ukrainian troops repulsed efforts by Russian forces to enter the eastern city of Kharkiv on Tuesday and foiled a planned operation by 120 Russian paratroopers near the border, regional governor Oleh Synehubov said. Five people, two of them children, were killed late on Tuesday when Russian planes attacked the town of Malyn, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) northwest of Kyiv, and destroyed seven houses, the state emergency service said in an online post. Reuters was unable to corroborate. The United Nations human rights office said it had verified 1,335 civilian casualties in Ukraine, including 474 killed and 861 injured, since the invasion began on Feb. 24. The real toll is likely higher, it said. A total of 2 million people, mostly women and children, have fled, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. ADVANCE SLOWED Western countries say Russia's initial battle plan for a rapid strike to topple Ukraine's government failed early in the war, and Moscow has adjusted tactics for longer sieges of cities. ""The tempo of the enemy's advance has slowed considerably, and in certain directions where they were advancing it has practically stopped,"" Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych told a briefing on Tuesday. Ukraine's defence ministry said Vitaly Gerasimov, first deputy commander of Russia's 41st army, was killed on Monday, the second Russian major general killed during the invasion. Russia's defence ministry could not be reached for comment. The main Russian assault force heading towards Kyiv has been stuck on a road north of the capital. But to the south, Russia has made more progress along the Black and Azov Sea coasts. Within Russia, the war has led to a severe new crackdown on dissent, with the last remaining independent media largely shut last week and foreign broadcasters banned. Russian police arrested at least 100 protesters against the invasion of Ukraine on Tuesday, the OVD-Info monitoring group said. Police made no comment.
