1/20/2022,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Workers on Wednesday dismantled a towering statue of President Theodore Roosevelt from outside New York City's American Museum of Natural History.    The ""Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt,"" commissioned in 1925 and unveiled to the public in 1940, depicts Roosevelt on a horse, with a Native American man and an African man on foot at his side. It has been criticized by some as a symbol of colonialism and racism.    The New York City Public Design Commission voted last June to remove it, the museum said on its website. Its new destination will be the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in Medora, North Dakota, the New York Times reported.    The museum on its website said it was proud of its long association with the Roosevelt family, adding: ""At the same time, the statue itself communicates a racial hierarchy the Museum and members of the public have long found disturbing.""    Roosevelt, who was president from 1901 to 1909, was known for his exuberant and daring manner. He implemented antitrust and conservationist reforms, though critics said he took an interventionist approach to foreign policy, including projecting U.S. naval power around the world.    (Reporting by Matthew Lewis in Chicago and Reuters Television in New York, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien) ",U.S./Reuters,Teddy Roosevelt statue removed from outside New York museum,https://news.yahoo.com/teddy-roosevelt-statue-removed-outside-182830026.html
1/20/2022,"What are the odds of catching COVID-19 after a night at the movie theater? How about an afternoon at the gym, unmasked? Or an early morning jog in a neighborhood park? It’s well known that certain places and activities carry varying risks of coronavirus exposure, but a new study takes away much of the guesswork, offering clear estimates instead. Researchers behind the paper analyzed outbreaks and superspreader events and studied factors that hinder and aid the virus’ spread, to design a mathematical model that takes many factors into account before giving a percentage risk of infection. The percentage isn’t a perfectly accurate estimate, but it helps answer several complex questions: In what situations am I mostly likely to catch COVID-19? Least likely? And how likely is “likely?” Go into a crowded movie theater with poor ventilation and a mostly unmasked audience, and there’s a 14% chance of being infected, assuming everyone in the room is silent before, during and after the movie, according to the study data. But if there are people talking throughout — potentially launching viral particles into the air as they do — the odds of infection when unmasked jump to 54%. If the crowd is masked, the risk of infection drops to 5.3% without talking and 24% with talking. Given that COVID-19 spreads primarily through airborne particles, masks, ventilation, the number of people in a room or building and time spent in that space all factor heavily in the equation. Also critical is what’s happening around someone. Heavy exercise poses the most risk, followed by shouting and singing, then normal speaking. Least worrisome is the “silent” category. Unsurprisingly, being outdoors, masked and surrounded by silence is the best way to avoid coronavirus, researchers found. And the opposite is true: heavy exercise in a poorly ventilated place packed with maskless people is a nearly surefire way to catch COVID-19 — it’s 99% effective. But in between those two extremes are findings that may surprise some. For example, working out for even a short amount of time in a well-ventilated gym carries a 17% chance of infection if masks aren’t in use. And if it’s poorly ventilated? There’s a 67% chance. In many situations, changing just one single factor can be the difference between being relatively safe or likely infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that along with wearing masks, getting vaccinated and keeping at least six feet apart, improved ventilation — including open windows, ceiling fans and portable air cleaners — can help curb the spread of COVID-19. “With good ventilation, the concentration of virus particles in the air will be lower and they will leave your home faster than with poor ventilation,” the agency says. But researchers concluded that many indoor facilities, businesses, schools, houses of worship — the buildings where we spend our daily lives — are not adequately designed or equipped to handle the pandemic. “We urgently need to improve the safety of the air that we breathe across a range of environments,” researchers wrote in their paper. “Data from COVID-19 outbreaks consistently show that a large fraction of buildings worldwide have very low ventilation rates despite the requirements set in national building standards.” Want a free N95 mask?

1/20/2022,"A teenager in China who was sold at birth was left heartbroken after finally finding his birth parents and then being rejected by them.

Liu Xuezhou, 17, from China’s Hebei Province, posted about the heartbreaking reunion on Douyin on Monday, according toSouth China Morning Post.

 

Liu managed to find his biological parents with the help of local authorities after he was reportedly encouraged to make a post online. After doing a DNA test, police were able to locate the teenager's father, Ding Shuangquan, and his mother, whose name was not revealed.

Local authorities held a reunion for Liu and his father last month, and he then went to Inner Mongolia to meet his mother a week ago. However, neither of them wanted him around.

Liu said his father was worried about taking the teenager into his new family and said his new wife might divorce him. The teenager's birth mother allegedly told him, ""There would be someone else if your adoptive parents didn’t buy you.""

The teenager found out he has four siblings and a half-sibling. He also shared that his parents allegedly “felt they were being forced to support him once their story was made public.”

According to Liu, who is now a second-year college student in the city of Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, his birth parentssold him to a middleman after he was born in 2005. They paid a bride price to his mother’s family with the money they received. The two eventually divorced, and now each has their own family.

Disaster struck when Liu’s adoptive parents were killed during an explosion in their home in Nangong when Liu was 4 years old. His adoptive grandparents eventually took him in, but he reportedly moved around and also lived with other relatives.

Liu, who has had several odd jobs in the past and lived on government subsidy for orphans, will continue receiving the local government’s help even though he is technically no longer an orphan, according to the deputy head of the civil affairs department of Dacun township.

1/20/2022,"The New York Attorney General first subpoenaed the Trump Organization in December 2019. The company produced just three documents from Donald Trump out of more than 5 million it handed over. The attorney general's office wants the former president to sit for a deposition. The Trump Organization gave the New York Attorney General's Office just three documents from former President Donald Trump in response to a subpoena issued more than two years ago, according to a new court filing. New York Attorney General Letitia James first subpoenaed the Trump Organization in December 2019 as part of an investigation into whether the company misrepresented property values to pay little in taxes while receiving favorable loan and insurance rates. Only three of more than 5 million documents the company handed over in the two years since were actually produced by Trump, according to James' office. Trump led the company for decades before his presidential inauguration in January 2017. James's office referenced the documents in a legal memorandum asking a judge to force the former president, Donald Trump Jr., and Ivanka Trump to sit for depositions about the company's finances. Attorneys for the Trump family have asked the judge to quash the subpoenas for depositions, which were issued in December 2021. Two of the three letters from Trump were entered as exhibits on Wednesday morning to support the attorney general's motion, an Insider review of court documents found. One is a letter to Deutsche Bank's CEO dated November 2011, which included a financial statement and in which Trump apparently sought a loan for the Trump National Doral resort in Miami. ""Hope you will be impressed!"" Trump wrote in the letter. The other is a letter dated November 2015 asking Deutsche Bank for copies of financial documents for an audit. The letters were given to James' office on July 22, 2021, several weeks after the Manhattan District Attorney's Office indicted the Trump Organization and CFO Allen Weisselberg, alleging they evaded taxes. The Trump Organization hasn't produced any documents from Trump since then, James' office said in court filings. The district attorney's and James' investigations have been running in tandem. The company and Weisselberg had denied the allegations in the indictment. Attorneys for the Trump Organization have argued in court filings that Trump had little personal involvement in preparing financial documents. But Assistant Attorney General Colleen Faherty wrote in a letter dated July 2021 that the company was deliberately withholding documents that it knew were relevant. Trump rarely uses computers or email, but Faherty wrote that ""file cabinets at the Trump Organization holding Mr. Trump's files"" included ""hard copy documents"" and ""Post-It Notes"" that James' office was seeking. James' office argues in the new court filings that documents and testimony it obtained show there's ample evidence the Trump Organization lied about its property values. Earlier in January, Trump filed a federal lawsuit seeking to halt James' investigation. Representatives for the Trump Organization have denied any wrongdoing and said the investigation is politically motivated.

However, scientists are already trying to pinpoint exactly when the Sun will die. Of course, it isn’t as simple as throwing out a date. After all, we’re working with a massive ball of energy that we’ve still barely managed to scratch the surface of exploring. However, scientists have managed to figure out a few key points about the Sun’s future, including the end of its current life phase.

While the full death of the Sun is still trillions of years away, some scientists believe the current phase of the Sun’s life cycle will end as soon as 5 billion years from now. At that point, the massive star at the center of our Solar System will have eaten through most of its hydrogen core. Effectively, the Sun as we know it will have died. When that happens, the Sun will become a red giant. It will stop creating heat via nuclear fusion. NASA says the core will become unstable and contract around this time. Once the core starts to become unstable, the outer layers of the Sun will expand. That expansion will eventually swallow up Mercury and Venus. Additionally, rough solar winds from the Sun will beat at the Earth, stripping it of the magnetic field that generates its atmosphere. It’s a scary time to think about, especially for any life—human or non-human—that might remain all those years from now. Of course, there’s a slew of other threats from the Sun before that happens. While the idea of the Sun dying is scary, there’s a chance humanity won’t even be around to experience it. According to scientists, the Earth’s oceans will be vaporized by the energy from the Sun a billion years from now. At that time, the Sun’s brightness will also have increased by around 10 percent. There are also other threats of climate change to take into account as well. Ultimately, the future of the Earth is grim, at least scientists say it is. Perhaps that’s why so many people are so focused on space travel and getting us to other planets. Not only would it allow humanity to continue surviving, but it would give us a new home to go to when the Sun eventually dies.

The company, Baseline Team, was founded with former Fresno State cross country runners David Vartanian and Mehdi Brahim and its main focus for now is basketball shorts. “We gave them 25% of the company for a couple of reasons,” Vartanian told Forbes. “One, because of their following, because of who they are and what they represent. And then we also added a board seat,” explaining that move “gives more weight and element to this for them. There are three board seats, and they have one of them.” The Cavinder twins, who signed a deal with Boost Mobile on the first day college student-athletes could profit from their name, image and likeness and have since landed a number of high-profile deals, are believed to be the first to land a seat on a company’s board of directors. “It shifts the mindset from what I call the ‘vending machine transaction,’ of here’s $10,000 to make a post and we get all the upside of it as a company, but good luck with your 10k,” Vartanian told Forbes.. “Maybe you should be asking for stock.

1/20/2022,"Mindgeek CEO and Pornhub co-owner Feras Antoon gave an interview for the first time in more than a decade. Antoon spoke with Vanity Fair about the fire that destroyed his $16 million mansion in April 2021. He said Pornhub does not allow illegal content, and suspects anti-porn critics could have destroyed his house. Pornhub's elusive co-owner, in his first interview in more than a decade, said he suspects anti-porn critics may have incited violence that led to his sprawling $16 million mansion burning to the ground last spring. In 2016, Feras Antoon, the Syrian-Canadian CEO of Pornhub's parent company Mindgeek, purchased two lots of land next to a nature reserve in Montreal for $1.8 million USD, The Daily Mail reported. He spent the subsequent years building his 21-room mansion, complete with a nine-car garage and a 6,000 square foot ballroom, per Vanity Fair. Days after placing the house on the market for $16 million on April 22, 2021, surveillance footage showed two trespassers on his property before the mansion burned to the ground, Feras told Vanity Fair's Adam Gollner. The fire did not cause any injuries and nearby buildings were not damaged. Antoon told Vanity Fair he suspects one of Pornhub's many critics was behind the attack. ""Could the extreme religious groups have incited and encouraged someone to do this? Absolutely,"" he said. ""When you use extremist language and QAnon sentiment toward child trafficking, your words are going to attract and mobilize some of the darkest corners of the internet."" The fire happened shortly after Pornhub released its first transparency report which said the firm identified more than 600,000 pieces of content that potentially violated its terms of service. Earlier, in December 2020, the company had made major changes to the way it moderates content on the platform following a New York Times op-ed written by Nicholas Kristof that alleged the company was hosting videos of nonconsensual sex and sex trafficking victims, including children. The site told Insider in a statement at the time that ""any assertion that we allow CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is irresponsible and flagrantly untrue."" It purged all unverified videos from the site, but not before Visa and Mastercard ended their relationships with Pornhub. ""I can't even count how many comments I saw from people saying to burn the company or my house down,"" Antoon said. ""For a while, it was easy to dismiss the tweets as just people on the internet talking. Then my house burned down."" Sex workers have said some changes the company made in 2020 came at their expense. Verified entertainers could no longer get paid through two of the country's largest credit card companies after Visa and Mastercard cut ties with Pornhub, Vice's Samantha Cole reported. ""Any suggestion that we allow or encourage illegal content is completely untrue and defies rational reason, from both a moral and business standpoint,"" Antoon told Vanity Fair. Online platforms like Pornhub and OnlyFans were vital for sex workers during the pandemic, when strip clubs shut down. OnlyFans faced backlash last year after booting (and later un-booting) adult entertainers from the platform. Got a tip?

1/20/2022,"An Ohio man unwittingly became a hot topic on social media this week, after his wife mentioned he walks a chicken on a leash around the neighborhood. Melissa May, of Verona, Ohio, posted the admission on the Appalachian Americans Facebook group (with 352,000 members), and included a photo of her husband, Shawn May, out with his rooster. The bird has been named Carl Francis and he follows her husband everywhere, she said. “Please tell me we are not the only ones with a rooster this friendly,” May wrote in the Jan. 18 post. “About 5 months ago, someone dumped a rooster off at our house. I have no idea why but they did. My husband is a carpenter and is always working in the garage. ... This rooster followed him in and hasn’t left since. ... The rooster now has a harness on and my husband takes him on walks on a leash. He also likes to be held.” Her post racked up 11,000 reactions and 1,200 comments in less than a day, including a lot of people who said they, too, have beloved chickens. One woman said her daughter actually made clothes for her chickens, another let the chicken sleep in the house at night (in a bird cage), and one family admitted to taking their chicken for car rides. “If he hears you, he will run to try to get to the car door or stand in front so you can’t leave!” one person wrote on Facebook. Melissa May says she has been taken off guard by the response. “I’m glad that our homeless chicken and my crazy husband can bring this much delight to everyone,” she told McClatchy News. “We decided he (the rooster) was put here for a reason and he was going to stay no matter what. The first night, he started eating my husband’s dinner right off his plate. ... I thought it was funny at first.” She’s the one who found the harness for Carl Francis, at her husband’s request. It did not strike her as strange after four years of marriage, she said. “Today, he decided to put one of our dog’s sweaters on the rooster to see if he likes it. Now, I have to get a sweater for the rooster, one that isn’t for a girl dog,” she said. “Nothing my husband does surprises me anymore.” Tiny ‘diva hen’ wins fans after video shows it taking on horse in New Hampshire barn Rare parrot-like bird thought to have died in 2019 mysteriously reappears in Hawaii Large birds are dropping from heat stroke in Arizona as temperatures near 120 degrees",U.S./Lexington Herald-Leader,Man seen walking rooster on a leash in Ohio becomes overnight social media celebrity,https://news.yahoo.com/man-seen-walking-rooster-leash-182928201.html
1/20/2022,"Parents in the US are at a breaking point, with school closures and lack of reliable child care. In Italy, parents have tons of support from family members. In Latin America, parents value socialization and are encouraged to meet with friends. Navigating a worldwide pandemic has been stressful for parents across the globe, but parents in the United States are operating in perpetual crisis mode. In fact, according to a 2021 survey of parents in 42 countries, parental burnout ranked highest among Americans. We spoke with international parents to describe the overall vibe in their countries, and why they're coping better overall than their American peers. The Italian government requires everyone to mask up, vaccination is required to attend work or University, said Candice Criscione, an expat who lives with her family just outside of Florence. Italians also have an excellent support system when it comes to raising children. ""Here, you see grandparents picking up children after school, and families trade-off with child care. If you need help, you won't have trouble finding it,"" Criscione said. Even if European parents feel depleted from juggling jobs and child rearing, ""there is a general consensus that sacrifices have to be made, and there's trust in what scientists and authorities are communicating,"" said Katherine Wilson, who lives in Rome. ""In the US, there is always pressure to do everything and at 110%,"" said Criscione, and that includes being amazing parents, teachers, partners, employees, and friends. ""Parents here are doing the best they can, but recognize that they can't be perfect at every role, every day,"" she said. At the beginning of the pandemic, Mexican mother Diana Bueno Bieletto was on full alert like everyone else, but that fear has since fizzled. In addition to having the support of grandparents, a cultural norm in Mexico, Bieletto said parents can easily afford help at home and therapy. What's more, parents don't prevent their kids from interacting. ""You see kids outside playing at playgrounds, malls, schools, beach, parks. I think we value socialization in Mexico even more than health. With omicron, we are all sick, but treating it as a mild cold. Even if our kids can't get vaccinated yet, we think very little of it,"" Bieletto said. Luis Enrique Rodriguez, who lives in central Mexico, said there are definitely moments when he feels tired, but not burnt-out. ""I think culturally we have more support mechanisms than people in the US, and maybe we're not so centered on fear. The first six months we were very strict about isolating, but then we started venturing [out] more and more, just hoping for the best,"" said Rodriguez. For Violeta Noetinger, a mom of four in Argentina, the beginning of the pandemic was exhausting. In a society that relies heavily on domestic help that was suddenly unavailable due to limited transportation, she felt ""completely abandoned."" But as time went on, parents pooled their resources. ""We hired private tutors for small groups at home — even going against local guidelines — to ensure that our kids had some kind of safe, limited, and somewhat periodic learning and social contact. If I have to think what saved us, it was the small groups we formed with other parents in order to help each other out,"" Noetinger said. Father Per Ola Wold-Olsen said that in Norway, the population has faith in their government and its institutions, something that hasn't changed during the pandemic. ""The government prioritizes taking care of the weakest — the old and the sick,"" he said, and for children and young adults, the goal has been limiting disruption of school and activities as much as possible. Even with homeschooling and working from home, "" families have coped well. Mostly, parents are frustrated over how little we can go to the office, travel, and meet in large groups,"" Wold-Olsen said. Rachel Meyer, an American expat living in Switzerland, said there's a real sense of collective responsibility for public health in Switzerland that seems to be missing in the US. ""The individualist spirit that drives partisan cultural divisions over mask mandates and vaccination resistance makes surviving the pandemic especially tough for American parents,"" said Meyer. ""Because of government-run weekly mass testing and student mask mandates, children here in Switzerland have largely managed to stay in face-to-face school over the course of the pandemic,"" said Meyer, and this alone has been hugely supportive both for both parents' and students' mental well-being. Grateful to be riding out the pandemic in Switzerland rather than the United States, Meyer said, ""It's hard to stay healthy when 50% of your community thinks COVID is a hoax.""

""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" Nearly two years into a pandemic, Dry January probably sounds like either a really good idea or a really painful one. But if you do decide to attempt one, you certainly won’t be the only one. With the last 10 years, Dry January has gained traction as a resolution. And we're betting it won't slip too far down the resolution list this year, since alcohol sales soared when the pandemic first broke out, and many of us are drinking more than we did before. The concept of Dry January is straightforward: Give up booze for the entire first month of the year. And yes, January is a month with 31 days, so no getting off easy at a nice, round 30. There are health benefits associated with Dry January—and there's also this: Lots of experts have issues with the quit-alcohol-all-at-once approach. If you've moved your alcohol consumption up to three or four drinks a night, experts warn against going cold turkey. If that sounds like you, try cutting back first to avoid potentially serious withdrawal issues. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has some useful strategies for cutting back. If those don't feel right for you, consider getting professional help, which is often only a phone call away via teletherapy. So is Dry January a good idea for you? That depends. On the one hand, making a drastic change like cutting out booze altogether can add to the many stressors you may already be dealing with, from unpredictable school closures to an ongoing work-from-home routine. On the other hand, it might be easier without the vibrant bar scenes of yore tempting you to have a cold one (and another, and another) and friends rolling their eyes at your Dry January resolution. If you're going to try Dry January, here's what to know about what it can do for your body—and how to make it just a little easier. Created by UK-based nonprofit Alcohol Change UK, the first official “Dry January” began in 2013. That year, more than 4,300 people pledged not to drink any alcohol for the month. And yes, “dry” means abstaining from alcohol for a month—no cheat days. In 2017, that number spiked to more than 5 million, with the enthusiasm for the campaign spilling into the United States. And in a January 2021 survey of 2,200 U.S. adults, Morning Consult found that 13 percent of them had committed to Dry January. Participants claim that giving up drinking for one month can reverse the negative health impacts of regular drinking, like fatty liver disease and elevated blood sugar. They also champion that not drinking can improve sleep and enhance energy. What are the benefits of Dry January? Which of the supposed benefits of Dry January really holds up under scrutiny? Anecdotally, people often credit alcohol with helping them sleep. However, a review of studies in 2013 found that alcohol may help people fall asleep quicker and sleep more deeply during the initial stages of sleep, but is likely to disrupt sleep later in the night. “Alcohol on the whole is not useful for improving a whole night's sleep. Sleep may be deeper to start with, but then becomes disrupted,” study co-author Chris Idzikowski, Ph.D., and sleep specialist, said in a statement. “Additionally, that deeper sleep will probably promote snoring and poorer breathing. So, one shouldn't expect better sleep with alcohol."" Also true! It sounds weird, but you may not realize how often or how much alcohol your drink until aren't drinking it. Drinking in moderation, which the 2020 Dietary Guidelines For Americans define as no more than one drink per day for women and two for men, isn’t all bad. In fact, it’s associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and death(although the healthiest option remains not drinking at all). Still, taking a month off may help you drink less throughout 2022. In fact, a 2016 study of adults who participated in Dry January found that up to six months later, they were drinking on fewer occasions and drank less when they did imbibe. That said, not all experts agree with the idea that Dry January is the right approach for moderating your drinking in the long run. “Come February first, you may find that those bad habits aren’t truly broken,” says Joseph Volpicelli, M.D., Ph.D., a physician, psychologist, and founder of the Volpicelli Center, an addiction recovery center in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. “Sometimes, it can be more beneficial for people looking to improve their relationship with alcohol (who don’t have a severe drinking problem, like alcohol use disorder) to try moderating their alcohol intake,” Volpicelli says. Consistently limiting yourself to one or two drinks per day (the definition of moderate drinking for women and men, respectively) might be a better way to build healthy drinking habits than simply going cold-turkey for a month without any plan for sustainable change. Your body breaks down alcohol via a number of organs, including your stomach and pancreas, but your liver bears the biggest burden of turning alcohol into less damaging forms. Constantly living in the drink/repeat cycle may also lead to fatty liver, a silent disease that’s relatively benign in its early stages, although more research is needed to determine the exact mechanisms. (Your liver isn’t the only thing at risk: drinking too much can damage your entire body, including your heart, skin, penis, and muscles.) Even though fatty liver is common in those who drink at or above the guidelines (“moderate” is defined as no more than two drinks per day for men), there is evidence that it’s reversible when you abstain from alcohol or even drink less, says Rotonya Carr, M.D., hepatologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. With continued drinking, about a third of people with fatty liver go on to develop alcoholic hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, which eventually leads to scarring and the life-threatening condition of cirrhosis in 10 to 20 percent of people. Even in these advanced stages, research suggests that giving up alcohol can reverse scarring and improve the chance of survival. “The liver is a very forgiving organ,” adds Dr. Carr, “it can heal itself when the insult, in this case alcohol, goes away.” So, does Dry January erase all those nights of drinking? Not quite. It’s going to take more than one month to completely heal your liver and the rest of your body, points out Aaron White, Ph.D., senior scientist at the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. “But taking a month off from drinking is never a bad idea, and is a great time to evaluate your relationship with alcohol,” says White. Some men find it hard to change the habit of having a drink in their hand at 6PM, so they first change what's in their glass. Fortunately, there are now lots of flavored alcohol substitutes that let you dream up some really interesting alcohol-free cocktails. These would include products like Kin and Seedlip. Also on your side are the growing numbers of surprisingly good non-alcoholic beers. Check out the ones that passed our taste test here.

1/20/2022,"Recent fears about potential pork shortages and massive price increases are not a case of theatrics. On Nov. 10, the California Grocers Association, California Restaurant Association, California Retailers Association, California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce and a family processor filed a lawsuit requesting a delay in the implementation of California’s Proposition 12, which added new requirements for how pork that is consumed in California is raised, even if it’s raised out of state. The lawsuit was necessary because entire California industries throughout the food supply chain are unsure exactly how they are expected to comply with the new law that hit on Jan. 1. Grocers, retailers, restaurants and family processors are all scratching their heads, wondering how they will sell Prop. 12 compliant pork this year. The problem is the state still has not finalized the rules and regulations all industry stakeholders need to come into compliance and to demonstrate that all pork they buy or sell was raised under the new requirements. With 98% of pork coming from out of state, the state’s pork suppliers have no way of proving on their own that pork was raised in compliance with Prop. 12. They must be able to rely on a state-approved certification system. But, under new draft regulations just released by the state, that certification system is still two years away from being in place. Under Prop. 12, the state was required to complete those rules by Sept. 1, 2019. That would have given the food industry 28 months to implement any required changes, like new labeling and ensuring that all pork from out of state was shipped with valid certificates. Now, without any rules in place about how to label and certify pork, the food industry has no idea how to supply California with pork in 2022. COVID-19 may have caused delays in issuing regulations, and perhaps Prop. 12 should have provided a longer period of time for California to write new regulations, like Prop. 2 did for the egg industry. Regardless, the state’s delay will cause confusion among California businesses and consumers. The state has not fulfilled its basic responsibility of providing the framework for lawful compliance with Prop. 12 and implementing the necessary certification system, leaving this group with no choice but to seek relief through the courts. In Massachusetts, where a similar animal housing measure passed in 2016, their equivalent of the state Assembly voted overwhelmingly to extend the deadline for implementation to allow regulators to finish rules and for the market to comply. The delay is expected to be finalized once conferences with the state Senate are complete. This is not the case in the Golden State, and without court action, an entire industry that tens of thousands of California businesses rely on will be unnecessarily bottlenecked. It is the equivalent of posting a speed limit sign without telling drivers what the limit is. More worrisome, it will be California families and small businesses that feel the impact the most. Californians are already reeling from inflation caused by supply chain interruptions, including on their favorite pork products, and confusion on the implementation of Prop. 12 is only going to make it worse. The bottom line is that the state does not have regulations in place, to say nothing of the complex system of certifying the operations of farms and pork distributors nationwide that the draft regulations contemplate. That places the pork suppliers in an untenable position, and consumers will, unfortunately, pay the price of this uncertainty at a time when they’re already struggling. Now, only the courts can prevent the impending impacts of what has been called “Bacongate.” Jot Condie is president & CEO of the California Restaurant Association.
