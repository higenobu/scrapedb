4/8/2022,"U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s scheduled visit to Taiwan was met with a fierce response from China, which warned of “strong measures” if the U.S. refuses to cancel the trip.

Pelosi was reportedly set to visit Taiwan on Sunday as part of her planned trip to Japan this weekend, but both Pelosi’s office and the Taiwanese government have yet to release an official confirmation.

Pelosi’s upcoming trip to Japan is now delayed as the House speaker has tested positive for COVID-19. A spokesperson for Pelosi said she was asymptomatic and received a vaccine and booster shot.

The visit would have coincided with the 43rd anniversary of the U.S. signing the Taiwan Relations Act, which offers “the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan,” according to the Department of State.

During a press conference in Beijing on Thursday, Zhao said, ""If the United States insists on having its own way, China will take strong measures in response to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. All possible consequences that arise from this will completely be borne by the U.S. side.”

In a Thursday editorial by former Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, Chinese state-run news outlet Global Times said Pelosi’s visit would be “the most serious provocation by Washington to China on the Taiwan question.” It recommended that the U.S., “while the crisis in Ukraine is still ongoing,” should be “appeasing China in exchange for not increasing support for Russia. However, the US is deliberately taking the offensive toward China, hitting China’s bottom line and trying to pressure China into strategic submission.”

Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokesperson Joanne Ou emphasized that asking U.S. officials and dignitaries to visit is “an important part” of the office's work, and official announcements of such trips would be made at the appropriate time.

The Kuomintang, a major political party in Taiwan, tweeted a welcoming message to Pelosi, hoping “to exchange views on matters of mutual interests during the visit.”

4/8/2022,"On Wednesday, Amtrak joined Twitch to stream an empty railroad in Mississippi. The company is fighting to restart passenger service between Mobile and New Orleans. Freight companies argue that the service would ""unreasonably impair"" their operations. At Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, there's a set of railroad tracks used by freight trains. On Wednesday, Amtrak livestreamed the steel tracks on Twitch. Amtrak's goal was to show how deserted the railroad is. It's the company's latest move in an ongoing fight to restart passenger service between Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana, which stopped after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, according to Vice. CSX and Norfolk Southern are involved in the dispute with Amtrak. The freight-train companies say the passenger service's plan to add four trains, or two round-trip trains, a day to the route without making infrastructure improvements would impair their operations, as Roll Call reported. According to Twitch, over 1,300 people tuned into Amtrak's stream titled ""CSX's Very Busy Gulf Coast Corridor."" ""We thought about putting up a live video feed to answer the question that people keep bringing up: How busy is the railroad anyway?"" a spokesperson for Amtrak told Insider. The spokesperson said that between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Amtrak recorded five trains on CSX's tracks. Due to technical difficulties, the livestream cut in and out throughout the day, the spokesperson added. While Norfolk Southern declined to comment, a CSX representative told Insider in a statement that ""it takes a freight train about 8-10 hours to travel between New Orleans and Mobile. Focusing on one point of a line that traverses approximately 138 single track miles, major ports, and Interchange points and then purporting that it is indicative of the operational realities of the entire line is grossly misleading."" ""Anyone that understands railroad operations, including Amtrak, would know that,"" the statement continued. Amtrak has the right to access any US rail line under the 1970 Rail Passenger Service Act, according to Roll Call, and passenger trains also have priority over freight traffic, as Vice reported. However, Congress has also said that additional Amtrak trains can only operate provided they wouldn't ""impair unreasonably freight transportation."" In a November 2021 joint filing from CSX and Norfolk Southern viewed by Insider (and available to download from Railway Age), the freight-train companies argued that the Surface Transportation Board, which regulates freight rail, should deny Amtrak's proposal to start service on the route. They argued Amtrak's proposed service would ""unreasonably impair"" their existing operations. The companies added that if the board approves Amtrak's request, it should require the passenger service to pay for and install infrastructure improvements ""to prevent a near catastrophic meltdown of freight operations."" The filing also included a proposal for a plan to make improvements to the railroad that the companies say would cost between $405 million and $440 million, and add a total of 122,000 feet of track. Amtrak's spokesperson argued that the freight companies are ""essentially trying to veto the expansion of passenger service by holding the service hostage to $440 million or more in ransom."" The spokesperson said he expects it will be weeks before the board comes to its decision on whether Amtrak can operate its passenger service between Mobile and New Orleans.
