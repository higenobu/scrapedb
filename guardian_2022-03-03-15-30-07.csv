3/3/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray with you again. Here are the stories that matter most. The Black Sea port of Kherson has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under de facto control of Russia forces, based on statements by its mayor, who said residents should obey a curfew imposed by the “armed visitors”. Igor Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russians and he was “only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked [them] not to shoot people”. The UN high commissioner for refugees said a million people had fled Ukraine “in just seven days”. Russian forces are understood to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant. Zaporizhzhia houses six of the country’s 15 reactors. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), called for the plant’s workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Russian artillery and missiles have continued to bombard other major cities including the capital, Kyiv, and the second-biggest city, Kharkiv, where a Ukrainian member of the European monitoring mission was killed in the bombing. Fierce fighting is believed to have taken place in the port of Mariupol in the south-east, where Ukrainian forces were reportedly surrounded by the Russian-aligned forces. The UK and 37 other countries have formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC) – the largest such referral in the court’s history. An emergency session of the UN general assembly has voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces: 141 voted for the resolution, 35 abstained, and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. The civilian tally in Ukraine is feared to be much higher than the hundreds estimated by the UN. Ukraine’s government has said nearly 6,000 Russian troops have been killed; the Kremlin put the figure at 498. In Russia, police arrests of anti-war protesters have included terrified children and an elderly woman said to have survived the siege of Leningrad. Russian oligarchs have been squeezed further as German authorities reportedly seized the $600m superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard. It came after Roman Abramovich put English football club Chelsea up for sale, nearly 20 years after he took control. Oligarchs under sanctions have been linked by the Guardian to almost £200m of property in London and the home counties. Keep checking our live blog for further developments. Tube strike – No tube services will operate across London today, it is expected, as London Underground workers strike for the second time this week. Transport for London (TfL) said people should work from home, or walk or cycle, otherwise expect crowding and delay on other trains or buses. The 24-hour strike, which started at midnight, follows a similar walkout on Tuesday by members of the RMT union in a dispute over jobs and pensions. ‘Intervene early’ – Sarah Everard’s murder a year ago revolutionised how the British public understand male violence against women, according to research for the charity Rosa. The first major survey of women’s groups in the UK since the 33-year-old’s murder by serving police officer Wayne Couzens also worryingly reveals the majority of charities believe the risk to women and girls has increased over the last year. A pending report by the IOPC watchdog is expected to find the Metropolitan police made errors after receiving claims that Wayne Couzens indecently exposed himself days before the murder. The IOPC is also investigating Kent police over an incident six years earlier that may have involved Couzens. Sandra Laville writes this morning that as government advertising puts a spotlight on male violence against women and girls, there is still a need to tackle underlying causes “by challenging the normalisation of pornography, by intervening early to address the attitudes of boys and young men, and by pursuing a zero-tolerance approach in schools to misogyny”. McDonnell, Abbott skip rally – Labour backbenchers including John McDonnell and Diane Abbott pulled out of attending a Stop the War rally in London on Wednesday amid pressure from Keir Starmer over the group’s stance on Ukraine. The Labour leader told his party’s MPs on Monday there was “no place” in the party for anyone drawing a “false equivalence” between the actions of Nato and those of Moscow. Labour sources have suggested backbenchers criticising Nato or the western alliance could be suspended. McDonnell told the website LabourList: “People are dying on the streets of Ukrainian cities. This is not the time to be distracted by political arguments here … So I won’t feed into that distraction by going tonight.” GMP must do better – Greater Manchester police (GMP) continue to investigate crime poorly 14 months after being placed into special measures; still take too long to answer both 999 and non-emergency calls; and remain short of personnel, according to an inspection report. Only 8.5% of crimes recorded in Greater Manchester in the year ending 31 March 2021 resulted in action being taken, compared with a 14.4% average across England and Wales. Only West Midlands police fare worse. GMP’s deputy chief constable, Terry Woods, insisted the force had improved, with response times to the most serious incidents down from 21 minutes to an average of 17 minutes. “Whilst this is still above our overall target of 15 minutes, we are already seeing five of our districts reduce their response times below this.” Volodymyr Ksienich, 22, has returned to Ukraine to join the defence of Kyiv. He tells Michael Safi how his life changed forever after last week’s Russian invasion.

I had a fever, I didn’t sleep. Nevertheless, the following morning I felt fine, and went to work. But that evening the fever came back, this time worse … Dr C placed a stethoscope on my back in order to listen to my lungs. He cleared his throat and composed himself. ‘Did you have any plans today, Mr Rees?’ He instructed me to go to A&E. They would X-ray me today. Dr C followed me out into the stairwell and called out: ‘You will go straight there, won’t you?’” Thomas Tuchel has insisted he is not afraid of change as he reflected on Roman Abramovich’s decision to sell up after 19 years at Chelsea and also on the impact of the turmoil on his players. As uncertainty swirled around at the club, Romelu Lukaku scored the winner as the Blues twice came from behind to win 3-2 at Luton in the fifth round of the FA Cup. At Anfield, Takumi Minamino scored twice in the first half to put Liverpool in control as they beat Norwich 2-1, while Southampton beat West Ham 3-1 to reach the quarter-finals for the second successive year. In the Women’s Super League, Arsenal moved five points clear of the title holders, Chelsea, with a dominant 4-0 defeat of Reading. Rory McIlroy says golf will welcome Phil Mickelson back when he returns from a break after losing sponsors over his comments about a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway tour. The International Paralympic Committee is to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Winter Games this week, despite a global outcry after the invasion of Ukraine. Max Verstappen has signed a new deal with Red Bull that is set to land him one of the biggest paydays in Formula One history. And Eddie Jones has made eight changes to his 25-man squad and has dispensed with more than 200 England Test caps for next week’s Six Nations game against Ireland. The global economic fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to mount, as the price of Brent crude oil added another 3.4% to climb to $116.80. With the cost of commodities such as aluminium, iron ore, copper and wheat also on an upward curve, economists are concerned about the threat of rampant inflation and recession. The FTSE100 looks like opening flat, while the pound is on $1.341 and €1.207. Our Guardian front-page lead today is “Russia wants to ‘erase’ us, warns Ukraine’s president”. The Telegraph has “First city falls to Russians” referring to Kherson. “Putin lays waste to cities” says the Times. “Welcome to hell” – the i looks at the humanitarian disaster that is the war in Ukraine, using a picture of a woman holding a newborn in bleak surroundings. The Mirror has a wider shot of a similar scene with a man cradling a baby born in a bomb shelter – the paper says “For his sake, for his future, STOP”. The Metro calls it “Their finest hour” as “A week on from Russia’s invasion, Ukraine still stands”. “Russians batter Ukrainian cities” says the Financial Times, while the Express says “Even Putin’s soldiers don’t want war” – a Russian taken prisoner by the Ukrainians is shown distraught and clutching a mobile phone. The paper says “they had no idea they were being sent to invade ‘brother nation’ Ukraine”. The Daily Mail has “Camilla’s anguished tears for Ukraine” after the Duchess of Cornwall met with expatriates in London. The Sun says “Clear offski” as Roman Abramovich moves to sell Chelsea.

3/3/2022,"The head of the New South Wales Transport department has produced a dossier of documents he claims showed staff in transport minister David Elliott’s office – including his chief of staff – were fully briefed about last week’s rail shutdown, despite the minister’s claim he was left in the dark about the closure. In the days after the sensation shutdown of the state’s rail network, the NSW transport secretary, Rob Sharp, produced a detailed timeline of the hours leading up to last week’s rail shutdown in which he insisted that the minister’s office was fully informed of the closure. The dossier of documents, released on Thursday, include the chronology of events to defend his department’s role in the closure. In it, Sharp stated the department was in “ongoing consultation” with Elliott’s chief of staff “throughout the day” on the Sunday prior to the shutdown, and cites a message which he insisted confirmed “Minister Elliott’s approval”. It followed Elliott’s insistence that the first he became aware of the shutdown was on Monday morning after the decision was made. In the document, Sharp included a previously reported text message sent by a senior transport official, Megan Bourke-O’Neil, to Elliott’s chief of staff at 10.43pm in which she warned of “massive disruption” on the network after failed negotiations between the government and the state’s rail union ahead of planned industrial action. Elliott has previously insisted that the text message did not prove he was aware of the shutdown, because it did not explicitly mention a closure of the network. But the timeline also reveals that Bourke-O’Neil called Elliott’s chief of staff after the text message, a conversation which is now the subject of significant tension between the department and Elliott’s office. Sharp’s timeline states that in the call Bourke-O’Neil “conveyed [an] assessment of network risks” and the view of Sydney Trains that rail services “could not be run safely and reliably” as a result of the failure to reach an agreement with the union. But that version is disputed by Elliott, and Guardian Australia understands that his office has insisted they weren’t briefed on the shutdown, and that the Sunday night phone conversation related to the need to re-list an application before the Fair Work Commission following Sunday’s failed negotiation with the union. After the conversation, Elliott’s chief of staff texted 56 minutes later to say that Elliott had been “briefed” on the decision and was “comfortable with our position”. Bourke-O’Neil’s account of the conversation would have been the subject of detailed questioning at parliamentary estimates hearings this week, but 24 hours before being due to appear this week, she was placed on “directed” leave by Sharp. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labelled a “cover up” and “scapegoating” by shadow transport minister, Jo Haylen, it means Bourke-O’Neil’s version of the conversation has remained secret. However the documents also show that as late as 11.43pm, Elliott’s chief of staff was informing staff in the premier’s office of “significant disruptions” and not a full-scale shutdown. “Advice is that we will not be able to run many trains,” she said in a text to Perrottet’s chief of staff Bran Black and other senior staff members in the premier’s office. “It’s going to be a rough one or two days.” Documents released through parliament on Thursday also show that department staff were discussing the views of the minister on the shutdown late on Sunday evening. As negotiations between government lawyers and the union broke down, Sharp asked one of his senior officials whether they could apply for a “termination” of the union’s protected action. In a message, the official tells Sharp there was concern about the “Ministers view of potentially having a number of days of disruption or full stoppages while we are in the hearing on potential termination and/or suspension”. It was unclear whether the official was indicating a concern previously expressed by the minister, or contemplating a potential concern from seeking a termination. Elliott’s handling of the shutdown was the subject of fierce criticism after revealed he had gone to bed before the decision to stop the trains had been made. Perrottet rebuked him for the decision, saying he “will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7”. The premier also held a meeting with both Elliott and Sharp in which he ordered all future briefings on significant changes in the network to be given in writing. But the documents released through parliament on Thursday show the department’s insistence that it fulfilled its legal obligations to inform the minister before making a decision to close the network. The timeline produced by Sharp was provided to the secretary of the department of premier and cabinet, Michael Coutts-Trotter, as well as Black, after the premier called for an internal investigation of the events leading up to the closure. Labor has continued to call for Elliott’s resignation after the shutdown. Haylen claimed the documents showed Elliott had “misled” the public by saying he did not know about the looming shutdown. “He knew it would happen and he signed off on it,” she said.” Comment is being sought from the minister.",News/Australia news,NSW Transport chief claims documents show rail shutdown met with ‘minister Elliott’s approval’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/nsw-transport-chief-claims-documents-show-rail-shutdown-met-with-minister-elliotts-approval
3/3/2022,"The Australian soap Neighbours will shoot its final scene in June following a record 37-year run, after producers Fremantle failed to secure another UK broadcaster. The series, which launched the international careers of countless stars including Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Margot Robbie and Guy Pearce, is the longest-running drama series on Australian television and was so popular in Britain it has been bankrolled by Channel 5 since 2008. The sunny lives of the Ramsay Street characters still attract 1.5 million UK viewers a day. “It is with sadness that after nearly 37 years and almost 9,000 episodes broadcast, we are confirming that Neighbours will cease production in June,” a Fremantle spokesperson said. “Following the loss of a key broadcast partner in the UK, and despite a search for alternative funding, we currently have no option but to rest the show.” The final blow for the Melbourne-based production comes a month after the UK’s Channel 5 announced it would no longer air the program. I will NEVER forgive @channel5_tv for destroying the legend and insitution that is @neighbours!!! We still have time to #SaveNeighbours so come on everyone, let's send those emails to @ITV and tweet until we can't tweet anymore!! #neighbours 🇦🇺🌏🦘 pic.twitter.com/jQ40itmw5q “Everyone at Neighbours has been overwhelmed by the love and support from the audience since the news came out,” Fremantle said. “The show has brought a sunny slice of Australia into the homes of millions of viewers around the world, launching the careers of dozens of household names along way. “But as this chapter of Ramsay Street comes to a close, we promise to do everything we can to give the show the send-off it deserves.” The show has not been a ratings hit for the Ten network since it moved off the main channel to a secondary channel about a decade ago, but it has been a valuable publicity vehicle for the network and has trained hundreds of Australians in the craft of television. “A much-loved stalwart of our program schedule for over 35 years, it has been a staple of Australian television drama, and Australian cultural exports,” a Ten spokesperson said. “Ramsay Street, Erinsborough, is a cul-de-sac recognised all over the world and has been home to Scott and Charlene, Des and Daphne, Dr Karl and Susan, Dee and Toadie, Aaron and David and many, many more neighbours. “Network 10 thanks the cast, crew, all the production team and Fremantle for bringing the perfect blend of soap and sunshine to audiences in Australia and around the world. “We thank the Australian fans and audiences for their continued support of the series. Their encouragement particularly in the past few weeks has been incredible. It shows that our audience still want Australian scripted drama. We have listened to them and there are exciting new local projects in the pipeline, which is great for our audience and for the local industry. “We are confident that the cast, crew and writers will bring their distinctive warmth, style and humour to the Neighbours set as they embark on filming the final episodes over the coming months.” We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support from our amazing viewers during this time.

3/3/2022,"Zero-tolerance drug policies at universities can do more harm than good and discourage troubled students from seeking help, a report by a UK thinktank has concluded. The report from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) highlights surveys that suggest just three in 10 students would be confident to disclose information regarding their drug use, or abuse, to their institution without fear of punishment. Meanwhile, 16% of students surveyed who use illegal drugs reported having scary experiences but did not go to hospital or seek help. “Drug-related deaths, which occur every year within universities, are largely preventable if the right policies and practices are in place,” the report says. “If zero tolerance means fewer people coming forward for help, and potentially life-saving information is not communicated to those unwilling or unable to cease illicit drug taking, then for us that is a matter of concern.” It says that helping students could include informing them about how to use drugs more safely, “however uncomfortable this may sound”, while also providing them with educational materials on how to reduce or stop their use of illegal drugs. John de Pury, the assistant director of policy at Universities UK, welcomed the report and “the clarity in which its authors put health outcomes first”. Universities UK this month announced a new taskforce, chaired by the vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, Prof Nic Beech, “to help universities understand and address drug use” among students. This academic year, at Bristol University, students are being provided with advice and support, including harm reduction sessions with a drugs worker on how to reduce the risks of using party drugs through testing kits, not mixing drugs with alcohol, and starting with low doses. “We understand that a zero-tolerance stance is harmful and damaging as it prevents students reaching out as they may fear being punished,” the university’s drug policy statement says. De Pury added: “Universities need a different conversation about drugs. We need to listen to students to understand and address harms and risks. Above all, we need an open and evidenced approach that has at its heart the safety and health of our university communities.” Mike Barton, former chief constable of Durham police, said: “The use of ‘zero tolerance’ is mystifying both in its prevalence and its futility. It results in a cruel lottery in terms of its impact on individual students and creates and fosters a wider encouragement of unsafe environments for those engaged in already risky practices.” Arda Ozcubukcu, the co-founding director at harm reduction social enterprise NeuroSight, and report co-author, said: “If students aren’t asking for help in a life-threatening situation because they worry about punishment, then that’s a serious problem. We all want students to be safe. Harm reduction-based approaches can literally save lives.” In October 2019, student Daniel Mervis, 23, died of an overdose after struggling with addiction. Mervis was a student at University College London but previously attended Oxford’s St John’s College where his struggles with dependency began. In her report last year, the coroner, Prof Fiona Wilcox, criticised St John’s College’s approach to drugs, saying its policy which threatened “to deal with [students who use drugs with] utmost severity” might discourage “students to seek help for their addiction out of fear of the consequences, either legal or disciplinary”. She added: “Support by the college may assist students … to access appropriate care, perhaps early on in their addiction and thus help prevent deaths.” A spokesperson from St John’s College said: “Following the coroner’s report after the tragic death of Daniel Mervis, St John’s College has updated its student handbook to make clear that we offer confidential advice to students to support with issues of addiction and use of illegal substances. We did this in consultation with [Daniel Mervis’s father] Mr Mervis to ensure we had fully reflected his concerns and removed any perceived barriers for those needing help and support.” The Hepi report highlights further survey data suggesting half of students would feel confident their university would deal with their drug use appropriately if they required support. “We need students to come forward if they have problems, whether in relation to drugs or as survivors of sexual violence,” it says.",News/Society,"Zero-tolerance drug policies stop UK students seeking help, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/zero-tolerance-drug-policies-stop-uk-students-seeking-help-report-says
3/3/2022,"The Metropolitan police made errors after receiving claims that Wayne Couzens had indecently exposed himself days before he attacked Sarah Everard, an official report is expected to find. Exactly one year ago Couzens, then a serving firearms officer in the Metropolitan police, kidnapped Everard, 33, off a south London street as she walked home. He later raped and murdered her, and he was convicted and jailed for a whole-life term, with the judge equating the seriousness of his crimes to terrorism because he had used police powers and equipment to carry out his attack. Couzens struck on 3 March 2021, having gone “hunting” for a woman to attack, his trial heard. The details of his premeditated crimes rocked Britain’s biggest police force. The Independent Office for Police Conduct launched an investigation into how the Met handled a report it received from a member of the public on 28 February 2021 alleging that a man had exposed himself at a McDonald’s in south London. A second report also alleged a man had exposed himself. Details of a car were passed to police. If officers had checked the licence plate, it would have shown the car belonged to Couzens. What checks were made or progressed – which officers can do from their desk with the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency – is part of the investigation. Such checks are regarded in policing as basic. Two Met officers have been formally notified they are under investigation for potential disciplinary offences. One is severe enough to be treated as suspected gross misconduct, the most serious kind of offence under the police disciplinary system. Initially both officers faced allegations of misconduct, which the other officer continues to be investigated for. A decision on whether the officers will face disciplinary charges and a hearing is expected imminently. The IOPC investigation is examining whether policies and procedures were followed, and its report on the Met was completed several weeks ago. The Met is not the only force facing claims it missed a chance to identify Couzens as a potential threat to women before he committed the murder. The IOPC is also investigating Kent police over an incident six years before he attacked Everard. In June 2015, Kent police received a report that a man had been spotted in Dover in a car naked from the waist down. One Kent officer is under investigation for alleged misconduct and the IOPC findings are nearing completion. It is believed there may have been enough information recorded in the Kent police system to have identified the semi-naked man as being Couzens, who was then an officer at the time with the Civil Nuclear constabulary. CNC says it was never told about the incident, and in 2018 Couzens joined the Met and passed its vetting procedures. He staged a false arrest of Everard as she returned from a friend’s house during a period of coronavirus lockdown measures. He used his police warrant card and handcuffs to lure Everard off the street before strangling her with his police belt and burning her body. Everard’s remains were recovered from woodland near Ashford in Kent, about 20 miles west of Couzens’ home in Deal, a week after she disappeared. A postmortem showed she died from compression of the neck. Two inquiries are under way into the Couzens scandal, one ordered by the home secretary and the other by the Met commissioner.",News/UK news,"Met made errors over Couzens exposure claims, report to say",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/met-made-errors-over-couzens-exposure-claims-report-to-say
3/3/2022,"The NHS is “flying blind” and “woefully unprepared” to cope with England’s rapidly ageing population, senior doctors have warned as stark new figures reveal the country has only one full-time geriatrician to care for every 8,000 older people. The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) said the drastic shortage of specially trained physicians to look after the rising number of elderly people and a lack of NHS workforce planning meant England was “sleepwalking into an avoidable crisis of care for older people”. Its analysis of NHS and Office for National Statistics data shows there is just one full-time geriatrician for every 8,031 people over the age of 65 in England. There are also regional disparities, with one geriatrician caring for more than 12,500 over-65s in the east Midlands, while the figure in north-east and central London is one per 3,254. Estimates suggest that by 2040 there could be as many as 17 million over-65s. But the college warns that many doctors will soon be requiring geriatric care themselves as 48% of consultant geriatricians are due to retire within the next decade. The RCP said the health service was short of staff across all specialities and the shortage of geriatricians was one example of why the health service needed more workforce planning. It said there was no publicly available data on the number of staff the NHS needed to train now to meet future demand for care. The college has joined more than 100 medical organisations calling for a change to the health and care bill that would require ministers to publish regular assessments of the numbers of staff in the NHS and social care system. “I have dedicated my career to working in the NHS – a service that I am fiercely proud of – and yet it scares me to wonder what might happen should I need care as I get older,” said Dr Andrew Goddard, the president of the RCP. “There simply aren’t enough doctors to go round, not least within geriatrics. “The workforce crisis we’re facing is largely down to an astonishing lack of planning. All successful organisations rely on long-term workforce planning to meet demand and it’s absurd that we don’t do this for the NHS and social care system. The government needs to … make workforce planning a priority.” Dr Jennifer Burns, the president of the British Geriatrics Society, said the crisis would only worsen with the “predictable rise” in the numbers of older people across the country. “It is absolutely vital that these fundamental issues around the recruitment, retention, development and support of the workforce are addressed, and that there is a properly resourced strategy for future needs,” she said. Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers and deputy chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the RCP analysis highlighted “the growing mismatch between the demand for and availability of geriatricians”. He added: “Sajid Javid’s recent commissioning of a workforce strategy is a very welcome step, but as the government’s health and care bill continues through parliament, we would urge the government to accept amendments requiring the health secretary to publish regular, independent assessments of the numbers of staff the NHS and social care system need now and in future.”",News/Society,NHS ‘woefully unprepared’ for care of an ageing England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/03/nhs-lack-geriaticians-ageing-england-royal-college-of-physicians-warns
3/3/2022,"Aprime candidate for secular canonisation – and a personal hero of mine – is Frances Gabe. She was a visionary, a terrible neighbour (she antagonised hers with a succession of snarling great danes and a penchant for nude DIY) and the inventor of the self-cleaning home. Gabe, who died in 2016 at 101, transformed her Oregon bungalow into a “giant dishwasher”, with a system of sprinklers, air dryers and drains, plus self-cleaning sinks, bath and toilet. “Housework is a thankless, unending job,” Gabe said. “Who wants it? Nobody!” I agree with Gabe – and with Lenin, who condemned housework as “barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery”. My own objections are mainly founded in sloth and a vague desire to stick it to the man, but for others housework can be difficult, or even impossible. “We’ve tied cleanliness to morality for so long that it’s difficult to see that there are reasons people may have a hard time keeping tidy besides being lazy,” says Rachel Hoffman, the author of Unfuck Your Habitat: You’re Better Than Your Mess. “If someone has mental illness, disabilities, trauma or chronic health issues, the usual suggestions of how to keep a clean home can be completely out of reach.” Many can’t and plenty more don’t want to clean. But are we any closer to making Gabe’s utopia a reality? If not, can we make the perpetual grind less arduous? I tried to find out. Dust is inescapable: after all, it is mainly – or at least partly, depending on whom you ask – skin. “I don’t believe any amount of exfoliating in the shower is going to stop our clothes and bedding also exfoliating us,” says Kate de Selincourt, a writer on sustainability and health in buildings. Some household dust is worse, she notes: it can contain toxic flame retardants from fabric, weedkiller residue from city pavements, microplastics and other delights. Could your home be less dusty? Possibly. Mechanical ventilation heat recovery (MVHR) might help. Designed as an environmentally friendly method of heating and ventilating homes, MVHR provides fresh air while conserving heat, but it also filters air on entry, stopping some exterior dirt from getting in. “Standard filters – G4 – can filter out larger particles such as insects, fine hair, flying seeds and other airborne debris,” says Chayley Collis of the Green Building Store. Users can choose a finer F7 filter, which also excludes smaller particles, including pollen. MVHR can eliminate some internally generated dust, too, since it is continuously extracting air. “For example, in a bathroom, when we shake a towel, dust is disturbed off the surfaces and often towel lint is released into the air. Some of this will be extracted by the MVHR system,” says Collis, although heavier particles just fall back to the floor. How effectively an MVHR system – usually quoted at £1,500 to £3,000 for a “normal” home – limits dust depends on how airtight your home is: gaping windows or doors make it far less effective. For a more lo-tech approach, De Selincourt recommends a shoes‑off policy and “plenty of doormats, ideally ones you can hose down”. It is 2022. Elon Musk can fly a car to Mars, or something. Can’t I just jab my phone and get a clean house? Almost. Robot vacuum cleaners are a reality – I have had a Roomba since 2006. It is an angry, battered, much‑repaired little warhorse that roars around, banging into things at arbitrary times of the day and night, swallowing cables, being confounded by rug tassels and demanding I deal with its “brush cage”. Despite this, I love it: it vacuums my floor with almost no intervention from me; the dream. “We knew people wanted a cleaning robot, because they would tell us,” says Colin Angle, the CEO of the US company iRobot, which makes Roomba. “It was: ‘Good to meet you, Colin, when are you going to clean my floor?’ There was no genius required.” Even so, Roomba was 12 years in the making. It uses technology developed for mine clearance to ensure coverage, and keeps costs (relatively) low with knowhow developed during a failed foray into robot toys. The engineers voted to call their creation the Cybersuck. Angle refused. “I get full credit for a moment of wisdom.” Although the UK remains resistant (a distribution issue, according to Angle), Roomba is one of the rare appliances to achieve cultural artefact status. It has inspired a melancholy vacuum’s eyeview Twitter account (@selfawareRoomba) and appeared in viral pet videos and sitcoms (Parks and Recreation’s DJ Roomba), while the tale of the one that recently “escaped” from a Cambridge Travelodge moved even a Roomba-sceptic nation. I think it is because they feel oddly … alive? Infuriating or endearing, it is impossible to remain indifferent to your tiny housemate. “The personification is powerful,” says Angle. “Within two weeks, 90% of people have given their Roomba a name or use Roomba as if it were its name.” (Ours is Noo Noo, after the Teletubbies’ vacuum.) When he took calls for the helpline in the early days, customers would refuse to relinquish their defective robots for exchange, demanding first aid for their family member. iRobot sends me its latest app‑enabled robot butler, the j7+, to try. It is definitely better at cleaning and more discreet than my whirring anarchist: there is much less bumping into things, thanks to the new algorithms, and you can choose to let it use your phone’s GPS or speak to other smart devices to work out when everyone is out and start cleaning then. It is also needier: after each “mission”, you can give the robot feedback, with options including “It didn’t need my help” and “It respected my home”. Noo Noo 2, as we call the sleek interloper, also shows me photographs of obstacles it has encountered (socks, shoes, bags), asking whether it should avoid them permanently or if they are temporary (it is always option one here, robot chum). The tech has evolved to recognise and steer clear of cables, earbuds and even – the nightmare scenario – dog poo. “We actually gathered thousands of pictures of dog poop and made physical and digital models of dog poop – all the glory of hi-tech wizardry,” says Angle. “We’re so confident, we actually guarantee against your Roomba hitting dog poop.” Has the servile j7+ – quiet, respectful, responsive, learning – lost some of the original Roomba’s wild poetic soul? Maybe. Could I get used to it? Oh yes. Robots can also mop: iRobot’s Braava uses the same technological bells and whistles as the vacuum, but it is quieter, slinking eerily around, clicking discreetly. My husband sets it up to follow the Roomba and it feels as if a phalanx of household staff are doing our bidding – the closest we will ever come to feeling like tech billionaires. Our floors are much cleaner, but the Braava is not fuss-free. Unless you use single-use versions (available, but hardly eco-friendly) you need to rinse the mop pad after use. It also sends plaintive messages asking me to fill its tank, but I don’t care about floor cleanliness enough to respond often. If robots could compare notes, this one would be complaining to Noo Noo about the month it spent begging me to charge it daily, while sitting mere inches from its charging point. Let’s hope they can’t. Domestic robots feel like the future, but they come at a serious price: £899 for the j7+; £699 for the Braava. An entry-level Roomba starts at £269. They don’t have all the answers, either: like Daleks, they are defeated by stairs. I check Angle isn’t working on a stair‑cleaning vacuum. “I’ve made many robots that can climb stairs,” he says. “You just don’t want to pay for it.” I receive a heartfelt plea to investigate the hair problem from a household of multiple dogs and long-haired women; I wish I had better news for them. Oxo’s drain protector does come highly recommended if plughole hair is your bugbear, though. Personally, I am with the cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie, who says: “I get quite excited by unblocking it, pulling it up and the whole great big ball coming up. Totally disgusting.” If all cleaning were as grossly satisfying, I might do more. Elsewhere, there is no magic bullet that does not involve buzzcuts for all, but MacKenzie is a fan of Bissell stick vacuums for hairy situations. “I promise you no hair gets caught in the brush; it’s a miracle.” I wonder about matching upholstery to your pet’s fur, but Louise Wicksteed of the interior design firm Sims Hilditch doesn’t recommend this. “A Martindale ‘rub count’ [the rating system that assesses fabric durability] of more than 18,000 should stop it from becoming tatty and snagged by your pet’s claws,” she advises. “Get parcel tape, wrap it around your hand and just kind of dab your hand on the sofa,” says MacKenzie. “It’s quite enjoyable.” And you could do it sitting down, I suggest, hopefully. “Kind of, yes.” She doesn’t sound convinced. I hate cleaning windows – I can never eliminate every smear. Can technology help? Outside, yes. Self-cleaning glass exists – and you can install it at home. Pilkington produces Active, a coated glass. “The coating works in two ways,” says its UK marketing manager, Leo Pyrah. “It’s photocatalytic, so it takes UV energy from daylight and the coating reacts to break down and loosen organic dirt.” The coating is also hydrophilic, which means it stops droplets forming when it rains, so “the water spreads out evenly”. It is 20% more expensive than normal glass and not something you can use indoors – yet. “We have been doing research on using UV lamps to activate the coating,” says Pyrah, but there is no imminent replacement for elbow grease, or, in my case, ignoring grease. If cleaning is too much, can camouflage help? When it comes to hiding dirt, ditch minimalism: pattern is your friend. There is a reason those English country houses full of labradors go heavy on the chintz. The interior designer Irene Gunter of Gunter & Co says that needn’t mean over-the-top florals: you can get a forgiving effect with subtle variations in tone and texture. She also avoids painted walls – “a real pain in the butt” – as marks on even the most aspirational heritage emulsion are hard to remove cleanly. In heavy-use areas such as kitchens and hallways, she recommends easy-to-maintain, wipeable wood panelling or vinyl wallpapers. Similarly, less-than-immaculate floors look better with texture. Wood is good, because it has “grain and life”. Avoid tiles that are “like a piece of paper, super flat,” Gunter suggests; pick something with a variety of shades, even of the same colour. “If you’ve got a bit of dust or a raisin lying on the floor, it doesn’t shout out at you.” Darker isn’t necessarily better, according to Wicksteed: “A common misconception is that a dark floor colour will hide dirt more effectively; this is particularly true when using dark stone to disguise a pet’s muddy pawprints.” But dirt is often lighter-coloured and mud dries paler than people expect. She recommends lighter-coloured limestone, which is more forgiving at hiding “tell-tale signs of animals around the house”. Match your grouting to your tiles, advises Gunter. If it needs to be pale, persuade your tiler to use harder-wearing epoxy grouting. “I don’t need to worry that in six months’ time I’m going to have to sit on the floor with a toothbrush,” she says, conjuring a scenario as unlikely for me as unaided flight. When all else fails, deploy the dimmers. “Lighting is about adding atmosphere and making it cosy, not about creating a sterile environment,” says Gunter. Beware claims of “soft white” bulbs, she warns, and appealingly warm pictures, which could be Photoshopped. Check the box: “You need to make sure it’s 2,700 Kelvin.” The self-cleaning home remains a distant dream, but there are ways to make housework feel less overwhelming. For Debora Robertson, the author of Declutter: The Get Real Guide to Creating Calm from Chaos, a clutter-free home is a simpler place to clean and live. “Paring back means you never have to clean, mend, polish or dust those things again.” Hoffman recommends “a mindset shift. Stop thinking of cleaning as a huge undertaking and starting thinking of it as a series of small, ongoing tasks you can mould and fit around your life. You can clean a room in one- to five-minute intervals, repeated over time.” She is also an advocate for asking for help – from friends or family if professional help isn’t feasible. “There’s a really interesting phenomenon where people have trouble keeping their own messes tidy, but can help someone else with theirs.” What makes the biggest difference for the least effort? Robertson is “obsessed” with airing rooms. “It’s the quickest improvement you can make. Throw windows open for at least 10 minutes every day and it’s instantly fresher.” Hammond finds clearing flat surfaces – tables, shelves, desks – disproportionately helpful. “It can make a huge visual difference.” Another easy win is making the bed: “Beds take up a lot of real estate in a room, so a neat bed can make everything else feel tidier, even if it’s not.” My favourite advice, though, is MacKenzie’s. “Don’t move around the house at all. Every time you move, you’re shedding dead skin cells and hair. Just stand still in one place.” Finally, cleaning advice I am confident I can follow.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Vac to the future!

3/3/2022,"In the run-up to the grim one-year anniversary today of the abduction and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving Metropolitan police officer, the government has released an advertising campaign to challenge the perpetrators of violence against women. The shift in focus to men who attack women is welcome. In the aftermath of Everard’s killing, women and girls were told to change their behaviour to keep themselves safe – from hailing down a bus to walking more assertively. It has taken years for this change in perspective, years in which female victims have not been listened to, or have been blamed for the violence perpetuated against them; the female victims, for instance, of the serial rapist John Worboys, who were dismissed and reportedly laughed at by Met officers, a failure which meant he went on to attack more women. So, when finally the authorities turn their gaze away from the girls and women who are the victims to the boys and men who carry out the violence, harassment and abuse, are we wrong to have expected the change in policy to be a little more direct? Instead, Enough, a multimillion-pound campaign on radio, social media, TV and billboards, seems to tiptoe around the issue. Three posters contain images of young men attempting to challenge toxic behaviour among their peers, from street harassment to revenge porn and cyber stalking – but only just. The rest feature concerned couples or lone women gently speaking out if they see a girl touched up in a bar or a neighbour having a row with her partner. Given the epidemic proportions of violence against women and girls, this campaign could, and should, have been harder hitting. In the months since Sarah was kidnapped, raped and murdered, another 125 women and girls have been killed at the hands of male perpetrators, according to the Femicide Census, collated by Karen Ingala Smith. These include Sabina Nessa, a 28-year-old teacher who was walking through a park to meet a friend in Kidbrooke, south London, and other less well-known cases of female victims of domestic violence who were killed by men they knew. The behaviour of the Met during the last year has done little to close the gulf in trust between the police force and women in particular; from the handling of a peaceful vigil for Sarah on Clapham Common to revelations about the behaviour of officers at the murder scene of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, and the exposure of a culture of unchecked and often violent misogyny within the force – which ultimately led to the early departure of the commissioner Cressida Dick. In response to the outcry over the killing of Sarah, there was a flurry of announcements by the government and the Met promising to tackle the issue of violence against women and girls. Boris Johnson said: “We must do everything to ensure our streets are safe”, as a £23.5m fund for Safer Streets was created specifically to target women’s safety with money for street lighting and security. But the government has refused to make misogyny a hate crime – a move that would categorise it alongside race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and transgender identification as a motivation for offences. Instead Priti Patel is to make violence against women a priority crime for police forces, alongside the likes of terrorism. It’s astonishing that it has not been deemed that already. But no amount of announcements, street lights or advertising campaigns will work unless trust is restored and the police do their job to pursue and catch the perpetrators of the violence and abuse, with the courts then bringing offenders to justice in a timely way. The disgracefully low prosecution and conviction rates for rape offences have worsened in the 12 months since Everard’s death. That fact does not persuade women that their safety is a priority. Last year had the lowest number of rape convictions on record, according to the End Violence Against Women Coalition. The Office for National Statistics shows that there were 63,136 reported rape offences in the year to September 2021, while only 1.3% resulted in a suspect being charged. In what was an unprecedented response to a call for evidence from the home secretary in December 2020, 180,000 women and girls described the sexual harassment, violence and abuse they had suffered in their lives. Many said it was the presence of myths and stereotypes related to violence against women and girls that had dissuaded them and other victims of rape to come forward to the police. Of victims who had experienced rape since the age of 16, only 16% reported it to the police, with many women citing an increase in requests for personal digital information from their phones – targeting the victim not the perpetrator again – as a reason for their reluctance to come forward. As the Home Office ad campaign starts to be seen across the country, there is another gaping hole in the approach – the need to tackle the underlying causes of violence against women and girls through education, by challenging the normalisation of pornography, by intervening early to address the attitudes of boys and young men and by pursuing a zero-tolerance approach in schools to misogyny. One year after Sarah Everard’s death, there is a need for more urgency if anything is to change.

3/3/2022,"Greater Manchester police (GMP) continue to investigate crime poorly and take too long to answer both 999 and non-emergency calls, according to an inspection report. Fourteen months after placing GMP into special measures, inspectors from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) say the force still “doesn’t investigate crimes effectively, so some offenders escape justice and victims don’t get the service they deserve”. Only 8.5% of crimes recorded in Greater Manchester in the year ending 31 March 2021 resulted in action being taken, compared with the average of 14.4% in England and Wales. Only West Midlands police fare worse. The force needs to improve how it records crimes against vulnerable victims, HMIC said, noting some serious crimes, such as threats to kill, distribution of indecent images and child neglect, were missed. Part of the problem is personnel. The force does not yet have sufficient capacity and capability in its investigation teams to meet demand, HMIC’s “police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy” (PEEL) inspection found. Despite “significant improvement” in how it records crime, which means the force is now properly recording “a substantial majority” of the crimes reported by the public, it still needs to improve the way it manages initial calls so that vulnerable people are identified when crimes and incidents are reported, the HMIC report says. Delays in response can be “considerable”, resulting in officers arriving too late to secure evidence at a crime scene, inspectors found. “Victims aren’t updated about delays and their expectations aren’t met, which may cause victims to lose confidence and disengage. By failing to attend calls in an appropriate time frame, victims may be put at risk and evidence potentially can be lost,” the report says. Imploring GMP to “get better” at investigating reported crimes, inspectors found that some investigations “lack a structured plan and appropriate supervision to help the investigation follow lines of enquiry in a timely and proportionate way”. In addition, the force must improve how it is building, developing and looking after its workforce. “In too many areas it doesn’t proactively maintain or promote the wellbeing of its staff. Workload is high and the force regularly uses overtime to manage demand. This means its workforce is potentially fatigued, adversely affecting the work-life balance of staff,” the report says. GMP’s deputy chief constable, Terry Woods, insisted the force had improved significantly since HMIC inspectors visited in September. Response times to the most serious incidents (grade 1) has reduced from 21 minutes to an average of 17 minutes, he said, adding: “Whilst this is still above our overall target of 15 minutes, we are already seeing five of our districts reduce their response times below this.” Waiting times have already come down significantly, Woods said. The average time for 999 calls to be answered is about 25 seconds, half of what it was last July, though below force targets. It now takes three minutes 47 seconds to answer an average 101 call, down from eight minutes in July. “Whilst the HMIC PEEL review quite fairly portrays the position we were in six months ago, I am confident that we are already in a much-improved position and the changes we are making are having a positive and sustainable impact,” said Woods. When he took over as chief constable last May, Stephen Watson vowed to quit if GMP was not in a “demonstrably better place” within two years. Introducing the PEEL report, Andy Cooke, HM Inspector of Constabulary, said Watson “is aware of the inefficiencies in the organisational management, which have resulted in the workforce being unable to meet demand”. Cooke added: “The challenges facing Greater Manchester police shouldn’t be underestimated, but I am optimistic that the trajectory and pace of improvement will continue this year.”",News/UK news,"Greater Manchester police still underperforming, report finds ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/greater-manchester-police-still-underperforming-report-finds
3/3/2022,"Sarah Everard’s murder a year ago sparked a nationwide reckoning and revolutionised how the British public understand male violence against women, according to research. The first major survey of women’s groups in the UK since the 33-year-old’s death also reveals the majority of charities believe the risk to women and girls has increased over the last year. The survey by Rosa, a grant-making charity for 320 frontline women’s organisations, found 89% thought there had been a shift in public awareness over the last 12 months. “There has been a revolution of understanding, and the scales have fallen from people’s eyes,” said Rebecca Gill, executive director at Rosa. “I think there has also been a recognition of how normalised fear is for women. It is a fear we live with, and that we learn very young, and we carry it with us until we are old.” Everard’s murder by serving police officer Wayne Couzens as she walked home in south London last March sparked a national debate that continues to reverberate throughout the UK. Public fury and dismay further escalated when details of the murder emerged at Couzens’ trial. Meanwhile, two Met police constables were jailed after taking and sharing photos of murdered sisters Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, and last week a man pleaded guilty to the murder of Sabina Nessa as her community remembered a kind and loving schoolteacher. As well as raising public consciousness – more than 180,000 people contributed to the government’s call for evidence on its violence against women and girls strategy in the weeks after Everard’s death – the high-profile murders have lead to significant policy shifts. Earlier this week, the government announced a major communications campaign against abuse, and put tackling VAWG on the same footing as terrorism following calls from the sector and the Victims’ Commissioner, Vera Baird. The police have appointed a new national lead for violence against women and are piloting a more aggressive approach to suspected perpetrators of sexual crimes. A new Stand With Us fund launched by Rosa will open in the next few months and fund organisations in the “vital work” of tackling violence against women, said Gill. The fund, which stands at more than half a million pounds, was set up initially by Reclaim These Streets to cover legal costs after the Metropolitan police threatened individual members with fines of up to £10,000 for organising a peaceful vigil to honour Everard. Ludo Orlando, a co-founder of Reclaim These Streets who sits on the advisory panel for the fund, said it proved people cared. “This money hasn’t come from a few big donors but thousands of small donations from people who want to make a difference to the lives of women and girls,” she said. Asked if it was a fitting tribute to the memory of Everard, Gill said the women’s sector was wary of intruding on to the private grief of families still mourning their loved ones. She said: “I wouldn’t make that claim, but it is a fitting tribute to a moment, when there was a feeling that something must be done.” Rosa said the funding could not come soon enough, with more than three-quarters of the organisations surveyed saying the risk of violence faced by the women and girls they work with increased in the last year. This could be part explained by women’s increasing economic vulnerability as a result of the pandemic and a growing crisis in mental health, said Gill.
