12/17/2021,"When Barrett Pall started modeling during his freshman year at New York University, he imagined the job would come with glamorous perks and big paychecks. “In reality, that’s not what it is at all,” Pall tells Yahoo Life. “I’ve been very open and honest that on my very first photoshoot, I was sexually assaulted by the photographer.” Inspired by the #MeToo movement and the strength of other survivors, Pall, now 33, first told his story on YouTube and to the Advocate in 2018. Since then, it’s been his mission to expose sexual predators in the modeling industry and encourage other male models to speak out. “I know that this is not an uncommon situation for most models,” he says. When Pall looks back on his first photoshoot, he recognizes how his inexperience and financial instability made him a target of his alleged abuser, photographer Rick Day, who was subsequently accused of sexual abuse by other models as well. (Day declined multiple requests from Yahoo for comment. There is no evidence that he has ever publicly remarked on the allegations.) “I grew up in a difficult situation in terms of my family life. Resources and funds were not plentiful. We were poor. We were evicted from four different homes while I was growing up, and I looked at this as an opportunity to make a bunch of money,” Pall tells Yahoo Life. Going into the photoshoot, he says, he admired Day’s portfolio, which was filled with male models whose careers Pall aspired to have. Pall says that Day groomed him by gradually touching him more and more intimately. When Day started to make unwanted sexual advances, Pall says, the shock of what was happening made him freeze. “There is no one specific way that someone is sexually assaulted or abused. I personally was not penetrated in any way, but I was sexually abused, and I say that wholeheartedly, knowing full stop that is what happened to me,” says Pall. “There was no consenting, there was no asking, there was no ‘Are you OK with this?’” As a queer person, Pall believes that men in the LGBTQ community have a harder time navigating the modeling industry. He cites the unspoken “underlying agreement” among models and their employers, meaning they will do what they have to do in order to book campaigns or work with certain photographers. He believes that some photographers take advantage of this. “I guess this is something that happens, that I’m just going to not talk about and no one will ever have to know,” Pall recalls. “I got back to my dorm room and just cried and felt really dark and confused. To be honest, it’s something that I still don’t like to go back to because something was taken from me and there are pictures. I feel like you see my innocence being taken from me in those pictures.” Shame and guilt followed, and Pall pushed down his secret, silencing his pain in hopes that he could still build a career as a model. But agencies and other people in the industry constantly remind models that they can be replaced in an instant, he says, and this mentality, partnered with the powerful connections of the people at the top, encourages a culture in which serial abusers feel empowered. “They prey on our silence,” says Pall. “I came forward with my #MeToo experience with the photographer Rick Day, and I think it’s important to say his name, because he has been protected for so long by this industry and different agents and managers. He is a serial abuser.”    A post shared by BARRETT PALL (@barrettpall) It’s reported that 1 in 6 men has had an unwanted sexual experience in his life. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 38 men has experienced completed or attempted rape during his lifetime. In the modeling industry, 2018 saw several male models come forward in the New York Times, revealing alleged sexual abuse by photographers Mario Testino and Bruce Weber. Outside of male models, the entire fashion industry has seen a reckoning over the last few years. And in 2021, dozens of supermodels, including Carré Sutton, launched allegations of rape and sexual misconduct against former Elite Model Management boss ​​Gérald Marie, who some call the “Harvey Weinstein of the fashion industry.” There is no union for models, and agencies and brands are not obligated to step in and protect them on photoshoots. Born out of necessity, the Model Alliance was established in 2012 to provide support, education and encouragement for models to speak up against injustices in the industry. “There is something that’s taken from you, and as more people share their stories that are similar to mine, you get to take back a part of your narrative, which is taking back some of your power,” says Pall. Healing can take a lifetime, and for Pall, that journey includes helping others to heal. For the last eight years, he’s been working as a life coach focused on helping his clients unlock their potential — aiming to help change the culture for other young men who make the decision to become models.  He wants them to use their voices in the way that he couldn’t, back when he was a young NYU freshman with big career aspirations. “The message that I want to send out to other men, regardless of your sexuality, is that consent is something that we also get to have for us and our sex lives. It’s an enthusiastic ‘yes’ — or it’s not a ‘yes’ at all,” says Pall. “It brings me so much joy,” he adds, “to see so many people who had their voices silenced for so long finally get to say what their lived experience is.” Video produced by Jacquie Cosgrove",U.S./Yahoo Life,A former male model speaks out about on-the-job sexual abuse at the hands of photographers: 'They prey on our silence',https://news.yahoo.com/former-male-model-speaks-out-sexual-abuse-photographers-184259997.html
12/17/2021,"YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has recently opened up about the struggles he faced during the height of Logan Paul’s controversial Aokigahara forest (famously known as the “suicide forest”) video, revealing that he was also affected by the backlash.

In a dark place: Speaking to journalist Graham Bensinger on Wednesday, Paul, 24, revealed he lost many brand deals — including a $10 million deal with Target — despite not being in his brother’s video.

 
 “Every brand that I was affiliated with dropped me,"" Paul explained. “I wasn't even the one who filmed the video, right? It was just by way of association, because my brother filmed in the suicide forest, my life was pretty much ruined."" In addition to the brand deals, Paul said his YouTube career was also affected when the streaming giant demonetized his channel. The brothers were also blacklisted from the mainstream online community, and critics began to point out the negative things they had done and lump them together. Paul then said he later got into drinking and smoking cannabis to cope with the negative media attention he was getting. He claimed that everything he worked hard for was taken away from him due to the international backlash. People disliked him, and his friends left him, which was when the dark thoughts entered his mind. “I was like, ‘What's the purpose of my life? This sucks. This is terrible. I wanna run away.’ And I think dark thoughts come into your head of like … ‘I don't wanna be here on Earth anymore,'"" Paul opened up. When asked if he had ever thought of ending his life following all the controversy, Paul said, “Yeah, 100%.” 
What happened: Logan Paul ignited international outrage for showing the dead body of a suicide victim inside Aokigahara, located on the slopes of Mt. Fuji, in one of his vlogs in 2017. Many called out the YouTuber for laughing at the situation and profiting off the tragedy through clickbait.
 Following the backlash, several people uncovered some of the disrespectful behavior he exhibited during his Japan trip. He allegedly walked around wearing a traditional Japanese kimono and a conical hat while making fun of Asian stereotypes. Paul was reportedly sued for the video in 2020 after Planeless Pictures, a production company he was working with on the film “Airplane Mode,” lost a $3.5 million licensing deal with Google, NBC News reported.

12/17/2021,"Jake Paul says he is suffering from mood swings, memory loss, and slurred speech less than two years into his boxing career. The 24-year-old YouTuber opened up about his symptoms in an interview with journalist Graham Bensinger ahead of his fight against Tyron Woodley. ""I notice it in conversations with like, with my girlfriend or friends, like, not remembering something that I should be able to remember that happened a couple days ago,"" he explained. ""Sometimes in my speech, where like every hundredth or two hundredth word, I'll mess up or, like, slur. Which I didn't do that before,"" he added.

Paul claimed he's had anywhere between 20 and 30 concussions in his lifetime, though ""it's really hard to say"" exactly how many. Some of them, he noted, came from playing football as a kid and taking ""lots of hard hits,"" but many of them have come in the short time since Paul began pursuing boxing. When asked if he is scared by the number of concussions he's sustained, Paul said, ""Of course."" Repeated concussions and traumatic brain injuries can lead to CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a rare and progressive degenerative brain condition. The disease has been found mostly in athletes who play contact sports, members of the military and victims of physical abuse, though not everyone who experiences repeated concussions goes on to develop CTE. CTE cannot be diagnosed until after death. The symptoms of CTE include difficulty thinking, depression, impulsive behavior, short-term memory loss and emotional instability. Irritability, aggression, speech difficulties, trouble swallowing and vision problems may also be signs of the condition. RELATED: Tyron Woodley Insists 'I Love Jake Paul' Tattoo He Got After Losing Boxing Match Is Real Before beginning his boxing career, Paul had his brain scanned. According to Paul, a doctor informed the YouTube star that he already was suffering from a lack of blood flow in ""certain areas"" of his brain due to the concussions he sustained while playing youth football. Paul said he was told that one of the impacted areas is his frontal lobe — which deals with memory and emotional regulation, among other things. He returned for another brain scan one year later, ""and it was worse."" That's when doctors have advised him to quit boxing altogether, he told Bensinger.

""I was always thrown in there with people who were way, way better than me until I started to slowly get to their level."" To ""combat"" his symptoms, Paul has admittedly ingested psychedelics such as toad venom. ""I've experimented with that and it's definitely helped out,"" he told Bensinger, citing ""new research and science"" he has discovered about the physical impacts of the substance.
