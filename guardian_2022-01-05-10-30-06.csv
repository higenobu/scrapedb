1/5/2022,"Bangladesh have ended New Zealand’s 17-match unbeaten run on home soil with a stunning eight-wicket victory at Mount Maunganui. The world Test champions were dismissed for 169 in their second innings, with Bangladesh knocking off the 40 runs required for victory for the loss of two wickets as the tourists beat New Zealand in a Test match for the first time.  The hosts had began day five on 147-5, a slender lead of 17 runs, and were quickly on the back foot as seamer Ebadot Hossain clean-bowled Ross Taylor for 40, then removed Kyle Jamieson for a duck in his first two overs. Taskin Ahmed chipped in with the wicket of all-rounder Rachin Ravindra for 16. The Black Caps were rocking on 160-8 and Bangladesh finished them off, Taskin removing Tim Southee’s middle stump before Trent Boult departed for eight as he holed out in the deep. There was a brief early wobble for the tourists when Shadman Islam was caught behind for three off Southee’s bowling.Najmul Hossain Shanto and the captain, Mominul Haque, steadied the ship and by the time Najmul was caught smartly by Taylor for 17, the finish line was in sight. Mominul, who scored 13 not out, and the experienced Mushfiqur Rahim (unbeaten on five) ushered Bangladesh to their historic triumph. Ebadot finished with second-innings figures of 6-46, with his early wickets key to forcing a result. The former volleyball player, who is still employed by the Bangladesh Air Force, was named player of the match. “It’s a long journey, volleyball to cricket … I’m enjoying cricket now,” he said after the game. In the first innings, New Zealand had posted an impressive 328, Devon Conway top-scoring with 122, but they found themselves 130 runs behind at halfway. Bangladesh made 458 in response, with four players – Mominul (88), Litton Das (86), Mahmudul Hasan Joy (78) and Najmul (64) reaching half-centuries. Bangladesh’s first win in any format of the game in New Zealand gives them a 1-0 lead in the two-match series, with the second Test starting in Christchurch on Sunday. The hosts will be eager to bounce back from their first home Test defeat since South Africa won at Wellington in March 2017.",Sport/Sport,Bangladesh seal historic upset to end New Zealand’s unbeaten home Test run,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/cricket-new-zealand-bangladesh-first-test-report
1/5/2022,"A Coalition plan to give the disadvantaged small cash payments to cover the cost of rapid antigen tests has been dismissed by Labor and unions, as the government resists pressure to make the tests freely available. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the idea was “ridiculous” and finally called for the tests to be made freely available.  “We have considered the options and it is clear that this is the simplest, most efficient, fairest and most responsible way to fix the mess that Scott Morrison has made of testing at this critical juncture of the pandemic,” Albanese said. Ahead of Wednesday’s meeting of national cabinet, the Morrison government floated the plan in The Australian, revealing it would use the disaster payment system to give people on low incomes, welfare recipients and pensioners the funds needed to cover the cost of up to five tests. If states and territories agreed to the proposal, the funding would increase to cover the cost of 10 tests. Rapid antigen tests are understood to cost about $3 to $4 on the wholesale market, but are retailing on the private market for much more due to widespread shortages. The cash for tests proposal, details of which are yet to be released, was immediately blasted as a “distraction” and an example of the prime minister again offering “too little, too late”. “Today’s attempt to distract from his ongoing failure to make rapid antigen tests free and accessible for all Australians proves that prime minister Scott Morrison still doesn’t get it,” the Australian Council of Trade Unions acting secretary Liam O’Brien said. “Mr Morrison is planning to divide the nation by giving a small number of Australians limited access to the healthcare they need, while everyone else is left to fend for themselves.” “This does nothing to help small businesses and those that work for them keep their workplaces safe and open.” The Labor deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, also criticised the plan. “Nothing says too little, too late like Scott Morrison saying he’ll give some people a subsidy to buy rapid antigen tests (at retail prices) when you can’t find one to buy,” Plibersek said on Twitter. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, said the state had put in place a substantial order for rapid antigen tests that would begin arriving next week, and would consider making a financial contribution towards the government’s plan. “We want to make sure those who need access to rapid antigen testing, get access to that now,” Perrottet said. “We put whatever we need in to ensure that that support is there for people right across the state. “If there’s a financial agreement that we can reach with the Commonwealth government, from my perspective and the treasurer’s perspective, there is no dollar figure that we will not put on the table to ensure as we move through this next phase, rapid antigen tests are available to anybody right across the state who needs one.” When asked about providing tests free across the board, Perrottet said that would be a matter for national cabinet to consider. “Clearly, with the significant queues that we’re seeing at PCR centres, by the provision of rapid antigen tests at those centres we will see a substantial alleviation of pressure on testing, so that is something that we’re currently focused on.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He urged people to continue to be patient at state testing queues, and said there was a need to continue to adapt as the nature of the pandemic changed. “We’re in a pandemic. There’ll be curveballs thrown at us over the course of this period of time, but … we’ve overcome those challenges over the past two years,” he said. A growing number of experts have been calling for the tests to be made free, including the Doherty Institute head Sharon Lewin, who told ABC on Tuesday they should be “widely accessible and free.”",News/Australia news,Labor now calls for free rapid antigen tests ahead of Australian national cabinet meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/labor-now-calls-for-free-rapid-antigen-tests-ahead-of-australian-national-cabinet-meeting
1/5/2022,"In the middle of a question and answer session at an academic symposium, an audience member wearing a Boss Baby shirt showed off the Boss Baby lunchbox he takes to work every day. “Obviously I eat cookies for lunch,” he explained, “because that’s what Boss Baby fans do.”  There was polite applause. Boss Baby fans don’t just eat cookies for lunch – they also convene virtual philosophy conferences dedicated to the study of The Boss Baby, the 2017 DreamWorks animated film starring Alec Baldwin. Organised by Jaime McCaffrey of the University of Kentucky and Tore Levander of Fordham University, the first annual Boss Baby symposium, held online on Tuesday, brought together a wide range of thinkers to examine what we can learn from a movie about a baby who is also a boss. Over the course of an entire afternoon, eight academics delivered presentations centred around three themes: Situating the Boss Baby in Myth and Media; Personal and Professional Growth: Work and Play in The Boss Baby; and “Not enough love for the two of us”: Birth, Motherhood, and the Lack Thereof. They were joined at the end for an informal chat with JP Karliak, voice of Boss Baby in the Netflix television series The Boss Baby: Back in Business, and its showrunner, or “Boss Baby boss baby”, Brandon Sawyer. “Frankly, we don’t know exactly what you’ll find,” the symposium’s website admitted, “but we know it will leave you thinking, ‘Yep, that was definitely a symposium dedicated to the 2017 film titled The Boss Baby.’” It was. But why The Boss Baby? Depends on who you ask. According to one of the symposium’s presenters, it’s just the continuation of a long historical lineage of boss babies – or παῖς-ἄναξ, “child leaders”, in the ancient Greek – stretching from Astyanax from The Iliad, Hikaru Genji from The Tale of Genji, King Edward V of England and Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York. Regardless of why, there’s definitely a strong appeal at work. The film grossed half a billion dollars at the box office and has since been spun off into a 2021 sequel and four seasons of the Netflix television series. K-pop band BTS member Jimin learned English by watching the movie again and again. And when a Boss Baby balloon floated on to the 2021 Macy’s Parade, a transfixed crowd reverently chanted “Boss Baby” in near-religious supplication. Despite this semi-ironic popularity, The Boss Baby follows a plot that can be difficult to parse, not that that would discourage academics. “It might be thematically richer than the Bible and more confusing than Ulysses,” McAffrey said in her opening remarks. In the movie, the suit-and-tie-wearing, briefcase-bearing Boss Baby is sent on a secret mission by Baby Corp, where all babies come from. He’s charged with protecting the world’s love of babies, now under threat due to increasing love for puppies instead. So he sets out to stop the CEO of Puppy Co from releasing the “Forever Puppy”, a new version of puppy that remains a puppy for life, which would destroy babydom as we know it and for some reason is going to be launched into the world via a rocket filled to bursting with puppies. That’s a rough summary that doesn’t even touch on things like the super secret baby formula that keeps the Boss Baby eternally young while endowing him with adult faculties. It would take a PhD just to understand how that’s supposed to work, let alone to conduct a Freudian and Marxist analysis of the milk, as two academics did for the talk The Land of Milk and Money: Lactic Capital in The Boss Baby. Perplexing as the plot may be, the first annual Boss Baby symposium urged us to not throw out the Boss Baby with the boss bathwater. By the end of the day, we’d learned about everything from intertextual references in DreamWorks movies and US attitudes towards sexuality to Erik Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development. We even sat down for a serious chat about Boss Baby’s “narcissistic and psychotic orientation”, which, to be fair, doesn’t really seem like a rare phenomenon among upper management. It was during a presentation on the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre’s concept of play that it all twigged for me. The speaker had been arguing that an authentic existential attitude is predicated on a synthesis of facticity (boss) and transcendence (baby). I realised that the symposium itself embodied what it means to truly be both boss and baby. The presentations were both tongue-in-cheek larks for a laugh and sincere explorations of the speakers’ areas of expertise. There was genuine affection for the film, as well as a willingness to make fun of it. It was serious (boss), but it was also silly (baby). I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the answers to all of life’s questions can be found in The Boss Baby, but, like the occasional cookie for lunch, it doesn’t hurt.",Arts/Culture,‘Thematically richer than the Bible’: what I learned at the first annual Boss Baby symposium,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/05/thematically-richer-than-the-bible-what-i-learned-at-the-first-annual-boss-baby-symposium

1/5/2022,"In an open letter, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has called on the NFL and the Washington Football Team to improve safety measures at FedExField after a railing collapsed at the stadium on Sunday. In a video that circulated on social media, Hurts was seen walking off the field after the game in Landover, Maryland. Visiting Eagles fans reaching out for a high five were sent tumbling to the ground after a barrier gave way. Hurts has now asked “what follow-up action is being considered” after the incident.  “Many individuals, including fans, media personnel, and myself, were placed in a dangerous situation when portions of the FedExField tunnel collapsed,” Hurts wrote. “Although I was able to prevent the barrier from crashing onto me, that was not the same for others who could be suffering from lingering injuries.” “Through the initial shock, my first reaction was to assist those involved,” the 23-year-old added. “I understand the severity of what happened and am extremely concerned for the well-being of the fans and media.” “I would like to know what safeguards the NFL and the Washington Football Team are implementing to prevent this from ever occurring in the future,” Hurts continued. “What happened on Sunday put both fans and players unnecessarily at risk.” A spokesperson for Washington has said the team president, Jason Wright, has responded to Hurts’ letter. In a statement released after the incident took place, the team said: “to our knowledge, everyone involved was offered onsite medical evaluation and left the stadium of their own accord. “We’re very glad no one appears to have been seriously injured,” the statement added. “The safety of our fans and guests is of the utmost importance and we are looking into what occurred.” However, some of the fans involved have disputed WFT’s claim that they were offered a medical evaluation. On Tuesday, the NFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters after Hurts’ letter. The Eagles won Sunday’s game at FedExField by 20-16, helping clinch their spot in the playoffs.",Sport/Sport,Philadelphia QB Jalen Hurts urges NFL to act over Washington barrier collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/philadelphias-jalen-hurts-writes-to-nfl-washington-barrier-collapse
