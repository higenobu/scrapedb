2/5/2022,"On Feb. 1, the US Treasury Department reported the national debt hit a record $30 trillion, prompting much hand-wringing about the fragility of the US economy. Around $8 trillion of that $30 trillion cited by debt hawks as what the government has borrowed is the equivalent of that: Money that the government owes to itself in the future, says J.W. Mason, an economist professor at CUNY’s John Jay College.

2/5/2022,"Home prices have nearly doubled in the last 10 years – and that could mean you owe some serious taxes if you are selling your home. After bottoming out around $259,000 in 2011, the average sale price of a house has marched steadily upward to more than $453,000 at time of writing. Like many trends, the pandemic may have accelerated this but housing prices had already been rising for years. This has come as great news for homeowners looking to sell. They stand to make some real money. Unfortunately, with real money comes real taxes. If you sell real estate for a profit you will owe capital gains taxes on the money. Unfortunately, unlike the taxes held from wages, the IRS doesn’t take that money up front. You’ll have to calculate it and cut a check. There are ways to make that hurt less though. If you want help minimizing your tax bill from a home sale, consider working with a financial advisor. What Are Capital Gains Taxes on Real Estate? The capital gains tax is levied on any profits you make from selling an investment. This applies to most money that you make through buying and selling assets such as stocks, bonds and even real estate (such as your house). In the case of real estate, you would calculate your taxable profits as: Price you sold the property for – Price you paid to buy the property = Taxable profits So, for example, say you bought your home for $260,000 ten years ago. You sell it today for $450,000. You would owe capital gains taxes on $190,000 (the difference between your purchase price and your sale price). Long-term capital gains — that is, gains on assets held for a at least a year – are generally taxed at a much lower rate than earned income (money that you get from working). In 2021, for single/married filers the capital gains tax rates have been set at: 0 Percent – $0-$40,400 Single/$0-$80,800 Married 15 Percent – $40,401-$445,850 Single/$80,801-$501,600 Married 20 percent – $445,851+ Single/$501,601 Married As of 2022, the ranges are as follows: 0 Percent – $0-$41,675 Single/$0-$83,350 Married 15 Percent – $41,676-$459,750 Single/$83,351-$517,200 Married 20 percent – $459,751+ Single/$517,201 Married So, from our example above, say that you sold your house and make a $190,000 profit in 2021. Assuming that you’re single you would calculate capital gains taxes on this sale as follows: $40,400 * 0 Percent = $0 ($190,000 – $40,401) = $149,599 $149,599 * 15 Percent = $22,439 $0 + $22,429 = $22,429 This is a simplified version of finding your capital gains tax burden, but the basics are there. You could owe $22,429 in taxes on this sale. This is a lot, even when you remember that you made $190,000 in profit with which to pay it. (It’s even more when you remember that, having sold your home, you’ll need to find a new one in a white hot market…) Fortunately, the IRS has carved out an exception to help homeowners with that problem. The Capital Gains Exclusion If you profit off the sale of your home, you can exclude the first $250,000 of that profit from taxes. For married couples filing jointly, that number increases to $500,000. Critically, this exclusion applies to your gains, not the total sale. So from our example above, say you sold your home for $450,000 as a single person. Your profit from the sale came to $190,000. You could exclude that entire profit from your taxes and would owe nothing. On the other hand, say you made a $280,000 profit off the sale. After the capital gains exclusion you would owe taxes on the remaining $30,000. (Which, since all of that would fall within the 0 percent capital gains tax bracket, again comes to $0 in taxes.) To qualify for this exclusion you must meet the ownership and use test. This means that you must have owned the house and used it as your main residence for at least two years out of the five years prior to its sale. This does not have to be continuous. You can live in the house periodically, so long as it comes to at least two years aggregate. (See IRS Publication 523 for a complete description of the exclusion test requirements.) Members of the U.S. military, foreign service, Peace Corps and active intelligence can calculate their continuous use differently based on their deployment schedules. Calculate Your Capital Gains Taxes Correctly As we mentioned above, capital gains on the sale of a house are slightly more complicated than ordinary investment profits. In addition to the original purchase price of the home, you can also deduct some closing costs, sales costs and the property’s tax basis from your taxable capital gains. Closing costs can include mortgage-related expenses (for example if you had prepaid interest when you bought the house) and tax-related expenses. Sales costs generally apply to any money you spent selling the house. This includes broker’s fees, listing expenses, legal fees, advertising fees, money you spent making the house look more presentable for sale, and other related costs. The house’s tax basis is the cost of any major improvements you made to the property over the years. This is essentially any amount of money you spent on the physical structure that added value to the home. It is reduced by any depreciation in that structure (for example, if you added a deck but then let that deck fall apart), although depreciation is an uncommon problem for actively inhabited houses. So, for example, say that you are single and bought a house for $250,000. You sell it for $750,000. You have the following associated costs: $40,000 in renovations to the kitchen and bathroom; $35,000 in broker’s fees; $2,500 spent on cleaning and staging for open houses; $5,000 on lawyer’s fees and other associated closing costs. You would calculate your taxable capital gains as: $750,000 – ($250,000 + $40,000 + $35,000 + $2,500 + $5,000) = $417,500 $417,500 – $250,000 (the capital gains exclusion) = $167,500 You would owe taxes on $167,500. Do Not Sell Quickly If at all possible, do not sell your home in under a year. You must wait at least two years to sell your house in order to qualify for the capital gains exclusion. However, even if you don’t qualify for the exclusion you still can ordinarily pay the reduced tax rate levied on investment assets. This reduced rate is what’s known as the long-term investment rate. It only applies to assets that you have held for more than a year. If you own your property for less than 12 months, you have to pay taxes on any profits at the ordinary income rate (that is, the rate at which the IRS taxes work and earned income). This is significantly higher than the capital gains tax rate. The Bottom Line  The main way to reduce your capital gains taxes is by making sure you calculate in all of the reductions that the IRS allows to your overall profits. After that, the capital gains exclusion will eliminate much of the money that most homeowners will make off their sales.

2/5/2022,"The chief executive of Shell has defended his company's right to pay millions in dividends after a fourfold rise in profits driven by surging energy costs sparked calls for a windfall tax. Ben van Beurden said the FTSE 100 company played an important role in society by contributing to pension pots after it posted a $19.3bn (£14.2bn) profit for 2021, up from $4.8bn a year earlier. Shell is increasing its dividend by 4pc to 25 US cents a share, and buying back shares worth $8.5bn in the first half of 2022. Mr van Beurden, chief executive since 2014, said he “completely understands” the concern about rising energy bills. But he added: “Now that we have been able to rebuild some of the strength back into the company [post the pandemic], I think it is appropriate that we look at how we pay out [to shareholders]. Given many shareholders are pension funds, ""by and large [we] therefore pay out to society as well"", he said, adding: “Having said that, we continue to invest in the energy transition and supply the energy the world needs today.” Shell's results triggered renewed calls for a windfall on oil and gas producers. Kate Blagojevic, of Greenpeace UK, said: “While Shell is quadrupling its profits off the back of record-high gas prices, millions of households are left with cold homes and astronomic bills."" It came as Ofgem, Britain's energy regulator, announced a 56pc rise in the energy price cap, leaving British households paying an average £1,977 a year for gas and electricity combined. Global gas supply shortages have triggered price rises around the world including a four-fold increase in the wholesale price in Britain which looks set to continue for months. Overall, Shell hailed a “momentous year” that also involved setting out plans to cut emissions and shift towards producing greener energy. The company plans to eliminate the net carbon footprint of its products by 2050, and is investing $2-$3bn per year in renewables.
It is under pressure to go faster, however, and is also grappling with tensions in some markets as politicians and campaigners seek to curb fossil fuel production in an effort to cut emissions. The company recently pulled out of plans to develop the Cambo oil field off the Shetland islands, which had become a lightning rod for anti-fossil fuel campaigners. Shell still has several fields off UK waters and Mr Van Beurden said: ""I think we still want to continue to invest in the UK Continental Shelf, particularly in gas projects that will help alleviate pressures in the near and mid-term. ""There is actually quite a funnel of good gas projects that we want to develop. And of course we are looking for the favourable fiscal environment to make these investments sensible."" The company also has several projects in Russia and is one of several Western companies funding Nord Stream 2, the controversial pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Critics have accused Russia of restricting gas supplies to Europe to try and pressure Germany into starting up the pipeline. There are also fears gas supplies to Europe could be disrupted if Russia invades Ukraine. Mr van Beurden said: ""We are watching the situation in and around Russia very carefully. So far, Europe has never really suffered disruption [in gas supplies] from Russia even in very troubled geopolitical times. ""If there is disruption, of course we can step in and do whatever we can to keep Europe supplied."" Analysts at Jefferies said: “We believe today’s announcement should be enough to support the share price, especially when considered together with the strong earnings.” Shares rose 1.4pc to £19.60, leaving the company worth £147bn.",Business/The Telegraph•yesterday,Shell defends raising the dividend after profits surge to almost $20bn,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shell-raises-dividend-profits-soar-111252596.html
