12/13/2021,"Chest puffed, eyes wide and fixed on their target, Gerwyn Price steps up to the oche at the start of a new leg in the final of the Grand Slam of Darts. His first dart pings the red treble-20 bed. His second dart nestles in alongside it. Without breaking stride Price throws his third and final dart: another treble-20. As the crowd in Wolverhampton rise to their feet, Price pumps his fist for the camera as referee George Noble fills his lungs and belts out the signature call: “ONE HUNDRED AND EIIIIIIIIIIGHTY!”  Viewers watching on Sky Sports, however, will have experienced this moment slightly differently. No sooner had Price’s second dart thudded into the treble-20 than a remote camera stationed just behind the stage was sharply zooming in to the bed, magnifying the tension ahead of the third dart. For even semi-regular watchers of darts the 180 zoom has become so familiar it is barely even noticed any more, part of the tapestry of darts for more than 40 years. The 180 zoom is probably the most famous camera shot in the whole of televised sport. And yet it’s essentially a gimmick: an entirely confected and artificial injection of drama that bears no resemblance to anything the players themselves are experiencing on the stage. Virtually nothing like it exists in any other sport. It is the equivalent of adding a Batman-style “KAPOW!” graphic to the screen every time someone gets punched in boxing, or a comedy bassoon sound effect when a footballer misses an open goal. Yet whereas such devices are decried and detested in other sports, darts has always been radically different. Right from the start of its existence as a professional pursuit it was designed to be a television product as much as a sport in its own right. And so really the 180 zoom is more than a piece of nifty camerawork. In a way, it is the story of how darts burst out of the pubs and clubs and took over the world. In late November I spent an afternoon with the Sky Sports production team in Wolverhampton to see how the 180 zoom works in practice. Out in the arena a cameraman called Chris Pendlebury operates the crucial Camera Two, which is usually homed in on the treble-20. Until 2017 the zoom was still done manually but now it runs robotically, according to a pre-set computer programme. The hard part is being able to decide when to push the button. The man who has to make that call is Keith Deller. Deller is probably best known as the 1983 world champion but these days he is one of Sky’s “spotters”, whose task is to instruct the director and camera operators where a player is going to throw his next dart. “Down!” he shouts from his seat at the back of the production truck. “Back up! Now treble-20, double-18… double nine!” It is one of the most high‑pressured, nerveless jobs in television. Deller needs to watch the players’ eyes, so he can see when their gaze shifts down towards the treble-19. He needs to know which players like which combinations. He needs to know that some players – like Portugal’s Jose de Sousa – are prone to miscounting and throwing at the wrong number entirely. A typical two-minute leg of darts will contain about 50 different camera shots, almost all of them commanded in real time by the spotter. “It’s hard,” he says. “But you mustn’t panic.” These days there is an added tactical dimension. Not every player who hits two treble-20s will necessarily aim for a third. Maybe the bed is blocked. Maybe treble-19 offers a better route to a finish. “Players back in the day would just continue on the treble-20,” says the Sky analyst Wayne Mardle. “But that doesn’t always leave you the easiest route to finish. The players have evolved. There’s more money in it, it’s more professional. They’re playing the percentages.” Players such as Michael van Gerwen often like to go for three treble-19s. Others, like Michael Smith, will go for the 180 even if he’s on 182. “There’s something special about the call of a 180,” Mardle says. “The guys get a buzz out of it. Sometimes board management goes out of the window, Russ Bray or George Noble bellows ‘180’, the crowd roars like lunatics. And just maybe, it gets into your opponent’s head.” The tactics have changed, the psychology has changed, the pace of the game has changed, and yet what is striking is how little the product has changed. Visually speaking, darts on television is largely the same as it was more than 40 years ago, when the BBC decided to take a punt on the inaugural world championships in 1978. Nobody really knows for sure who invented the 180 zoom. Perhaps the strongest claim lies with Nick Hunter, the former BBC Sport director in charge of organising the corporation’s coverage in the 1970s and 1980s.Until that point televised darts had largely been a messy low-budget affair, characterised by frequent awkward cuts between the player and the board and a jarring lack of visual consistency. The board itself was invariably shown in wide angle, making it hard to see where darts had landed. But at some point between the quarter-finals and the final of that 1978 championship came the transformation that would change the sport forever. Hunter’s idea (or possibly presenter David Vine, or possibly producer Ray Lakeland, or possibly co-commentator and spotter Tony Green) was to film in split-screen, with one camera trained on the board and one on the player’s face. “This simple technical solution,” writes Dan Waddell in his book We Had Some Laughs, “changed darts from a sport that was difficult to capture to one made for the medium.” Zooming on a 180 had been tried before on ITV’s Indoor League, but only after the third dart had been thrown. The genius of the BBC’s innovation was to initiate the zoom after the second treble, instantly letting us know that a 180 was on. It quickened the pulse. It drew the viewer in a little closer, a technique almost cinematic in its manipulation. “The camera zoom told the story,” says Rory Hopkins, who has produced Sky’s darts coverage since 1994. “When it starts, you know you’re watching the ultimate.” These days various sports have tried similar tricks. In football La Liga has begun experimenting with a dramatic high-focus camera for its touchline shots. Cricket briefly flirted with a giddy low-angle camera shot for free hits. Inevitably such innovations have felt weird and ersatz. By contrast darts was conceived first and foremost as a piece of storytelling. It was not simply a case of pointing a camera at the action: the camera became the action. Perhaps this explains why, through changing habits and changing audiences, darts has not just endured but thrived. While other sports fret about how to make their product more television‑friendly, darts was there long before them. The split‑screen, the facial close-ups and the 180 zoom established by the BBC in the 1970s created a powerful visual grammar that, a few minor touches aside, has endured largely unchanged until the present day: a classic formula that, in hindsight, was decades ahead of the game. “We’ve looked at how we can make it better,” says Hopkins. “But really, they got it right the first time.” Sky Sports Darts is showing the William Hill World Darts Championship from 15 December to 3 January.",Sport/Sport,Zoom call: how the camera became the action in TV darts,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/zoom-call-how-the-camera-became-the-action-in-tv-darts
12/13/2021,"Amid the Covid-19 pandemic the president of one of the largest Native American– run non-profits has warned that health and economic disparities are still seriously affecting Indigenous communities, despite some progress achieved by the Biden administration. Josh Arce, president of the Partnerships with Native Americans (PWNA), told the Guardian in an interview that challenges affecting Indigenous groups ranged from health inequities such as high rates of diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses to inadequate infrastructure such as running water and reliable electricity. Nearly all of these problems were worsened by the pandemic.  “The issues are, by and large, some of the same issues that we’ve been confronted with but they’ve been really highlighted and exacerbated by Covid-19 throughout the past two and a half years,” said Arce, who added that such challenges “really permeate all aspects of Native life and communities”. For centuries, Indigenous communities in the US have faced challenges in public health, education, infrastructure and other areas, an aftershock of violent colonization and widespread racism. While the Biden administration has marked some progress, such as the appointment of Native American Deb Haaland as secretary of the Interior, an achievement that Arce noted was critical and brought hope to Native communities, Arce warned that more action is needed to ensure more progress for Indigenous communities in the US. “The consultation and the meetings and the tribal input will only go so far until there starts to be some action behind the words that they’re saying and the policies that they want to put in place,” said Arce. Like other marginalized communities, Native Americans were disproportionately affected by Covid-19, dying from the virus at twice the rate of white Americans. Health infrastructure in Native American communities, provided through the Indian Health Service, often is substandard , with hospitals and other medical centers generally under-resourced and understaffed, said Arce. Native Americans are also more likely to be uninsured, according to data from the office of minority health in the US Department of Health and Human Services, adding another barrier to tackling complicated health challenges such as the current pandemic. “A tribal hospital system might only have six beds in their ICU, and so you start to run out of space a lot more rapidly than you do in a mainstream system,” said Arce. The pandemic also affected mental health in many Indigenous communities. Native American populations already experience higher death rates from suicide, about 20% higher than non-Hispanic white Americans as of 2019, and higher rates of depression. But isolation and grief triggered by the pandemic has made the mental health epidemic worse, specifically among Native American youth, says Arce. “That type of isolation, prolonged isolation, has really had an adverse effect on communities,” said Arce. Arce also noted that generally poor mental health among Native American youth and insufficient resources to address mental health concerns were worsened by the pandemic, with rates of suicide among Native American teenagers “sky high”. Economic challenges such as poverty – affecting one out of three Native Americans – and high rates of unemployment are also chronic concerns in Native American communities, said Arce. While Arce noted that much-needed aid was delivered to Indigenous communities through the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, different reservation communities, notably those in more rural areas, still face challenges securing basic infrastructure needs such as reliable electricity and running water. “If we can overcome that next hurdle and really get these basic needs met for the reservation community, that’s going to be a huge improvement to the lives and wellbeing for those tribal members,” said Arce. Education nationwide has also been hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic, but historically underfunded schools within the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) system were already struggling to cope. The impact of the pandemic – such as meeting remote learning needs – has made the sector even more challenging. Native communities had problems accessing reliable, high speed internet, an inequity termed the “digital divide”. Previous attempts to deliver broadband to tribal communities did not take into account power limitations in some areas. While there has been a surge of funding from recently passed social aid packages, Arce says that communities are still facing long-term problems such as the blighted conditions of school buildings, understaffed districts and teachers not receiving adequate pay.Climate change will also affect Indigenous communities, Arce said, with its effects differing by region. For low-lying tribes based in states like Florida or Louisiana, predicted sea level rises could subsume communities. Similarly, Indigenous people in the northern plains could see their growth seasons, a critical fixture, disrupted. “They’re going to essentially get evicted by the results of climate change,” said Arce. Arce said that the Navajo nationis still dealing with the aftereffect of pollutants from uranium mining that occurred decades ago. Other tribes have struggled without basic necessities like clean drinking water, with one in 10 Indigenous Americans lacking access to safe tap water or basic sanitation, a phenomenon called “plumbing poverty”. Arce said that many of these struggles within Native communities aren’t new phenomena but areproblems that have been plaguing residents for decades. While the Biden administration is “definitely [moving in] a positive trajectory”, Arce said he is hopeful that more action can be taken in combination with recently passed policy to address basic necessities in tribal communities and other overwhelming needs. “I know that the pace of government can be very slow so I hope that these policies and improvements turn into action and not just be a policy that doesn’t have a whole lot of teeth,” said Arce.",News/US news,"Native American communities lashed by Covid, worsening chronic inequities",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/13/pandemic-challenges-native-american-communities
12/13/2021,"Pool A twig breaks. Promptly, obliginglystaging the haiku, one or two new frogsplop in the water, where their youngerkin lie or skitter, hundredsand hundreds of fat commas sweptfrom the compositor’s workbenchinto the sandy shallows, hundredsof little fat breathing pauses in the water’sdull paragraph.

Pool begins with the startling sound that sets “one or two new frogs” to “promptly, obligingly” stage “the haiku” by leaping into the pool. The haiku, of course is Basho’s. Anglophone translators have enjoyed imitating the sound the frog makes as it slaps the water’s surface, but Basho, according to his Japanese commentators, is more oblique: his third line simply says “sound of the water.” There is no onomatopoeia: this is left to the reader’s imagination. Rowan Williams is doing the same kind of thing, perhaps, with his first sentence, “A twig breaks.” We have to imagine the cracking sound, and the frogs’ frightened leap to safety. Literary allusion takes on a typographical turn when the tadpoles in the water’s “sandy shallows” are seen as “hundreds / and hundreds of fat commas swept / from the compositor’s workbench …” The metaphor may connect the double life of the amphibian with the coexistence of type and text, print and language. It may also allude to one of the translations in Rowan Williams’s collection, In the Days of Caesar by Waldo Williams. The latter is a beautiful poem, intensely of and for Wales and the Welsh people, but suggesting a transformation that seems boundless. This is the last stanza: Well, little people, and my littler nation, can you seethe secret buried in you, that no Caesar ever captures in his lists?Will not the shepherd come to fetch us in our desert,gathering us in to give us birth again, weaving us into onein a song heard in the sky over Bethlehem?He seeks us out as wordhoard for his workmanship, the laureate of heaven In the last line of the translation, the Old English compound “wordhoard” may suggest that lesser nations, too, will be redeemed, as poems, or perhaps one poem, by the “laureate of heaven”. The tadpoles in Pool are perhaps the punctuation marks vital to opening the verbal treasury. In the second stanza, it’s the turn of the new cohort of adult frogs, now fully “pumped up” and able to breathe on land as well as under water, to prepare for “the crack of danger”. The life cycle is merciless. Predation and desiccation are suggested by the “dry foot of the uncertain upper world / that no-one had predicted / back when it was all wet long soundless / clauses between the wriggle of black breath”. The grammatical metaphor persists with “clauses”, a reminder of the water’s “dull paragraph” of sentences. But now a watery luxuriousness is realised in the epithets “all wet long soundless” with their echo of Dylan Thomas’s Fern Hill, and possibly a nod towards Gerard Manley Hopkins’s delight in “wildness and wet”. The long stanza-crossing sentence that began after the caesura in line nine (“When their breath …”) flows onwards to its brief culmination. It’s cast in the future tense, but promises inescapable certainty: the new frogs “throbbing by the pond” will also be poised to leap from the “new Purgatorial / height back into steady dark”. Older emergent life forms may be implicated in this description. Less than joyously sun-struck once on dry land, they’re nostalgic for the earlier evolutionary stage. Williams builds an impressively varied vertical structure as his sentence finds its goal in the two-line list of “what the sun sucks upwards -/ green, limbs, lungs, even words,/ or wings.” Language itself settles to a lesser place in the jostled democracy of organisms and parts of organisms. The redemptive possibility implied by “Purgatorial” is narrowly kept alive, obscured by the uncertainty in which all life-forms participate, “the crack of danger” they fear, and represent, as soon as they emerge into self-sufficiency. Even the sun is ominously framed, its symbolism darkened, perhaps, by the environmental hazard the poet now senses in its life-giving radiance. By the last line, only two words, two syllables, are left. Pool is from the New Poems section of Rowan Williams’s Collected Poems. As well as the Waldo Williams translation mentioned earlier, Poem of the week has previously featured Rowan Williams’s poem about the Russian iconographer Andrei Rublev.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: Pool by Rowan Williams,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/13/poem-of-the-week-pool-by-rowan-williams
12/13/2021,"Trans actor Mya Bollaers brings a personal stillness and confidence to this flawed road movie from Belgian film-maker Laurent Micheli. Bollaers works well with co-star Benoît Magimel and together they do their best to raise the standard of this well-meaning but basically unsatisfying work. Bollaers plays Lola, a young trans woman who has been thrown out of the family home by angry father Philippe (Magimel) and is now living in foster-care accommodation while preparing for gender reassignment surgery. But Lola’s mother, who had always accepted her identity, has died and now a somewhat contrived series of events means that Philippe and Lola must take a car journey up to her childhood home by the sea to scatter the ashes – that time-honoured trope. Philippe is bad-tempered and transphobic, he misgenders Lola and uses her old name, Lionel. But there are no prizes for guessing whether they gradually come to terms with each other.  There are quite a few cliches here: at one moment, Lola actually puts her hand and head out of the car from the passenger seat as it drives along, luxuriating in the rush of air and freedom in the manner of TV ads. She even steals something from a petrol station convenience store and is made to pay for it by Philippe – a narrative touch weirdly similar to the sugary Oscar-winning road movie The Green Book. There are some laborious flashbacks showing Lola’s unhappy memories of childhood seaside holidays and Philippe’s car itself plays a strange role: it bursts into flames unattended at one stage for reasons that are not made entirely clear, apart from that it brings some bigoted cops into the picture, from whose ugly abuse Philippe protects Lola. This is a film that never quite diverts from route one: but Bollaers and Magimel show their talent.

12/13/2021,"Bill and Turner Ross’s 2020 docufiction Bloody Nose, Empty Pockets is set in a Las Vegas dive bar the night before it is to permanently close and, cultural differences aside, it is a frighteningly accurate depiction of the highs and lows of a boozy night down the local. The bonding, bickering and barstool philosophising among this increasingly inebriated motley crew is almost embarrassingly recognisable, but though it doesn’t soft-pedal the bursts of antagonism, fumbled passes and beckoning hangovers, neither does the film judge characters simply trying to push back the break of dawn, one drink at a time. In vino there’s often veritas; sometimes we see more clearly through the bottom of a glass. Jessica Kiang  “Alcohol: the cause of, and solution to, all of life’s problems!” This phrase was coined by one great small-screen boozer (Homer Simpson) but it could equally have been credited to Don Draper and most of the cast of the darkly glorious Mad Men. There were very few business deals that could not be lubricated by an old fashioned or five. Alcohol acted as a relaxant, an accelerant, a truth serum and an aesthetic. In the world of Mad Men, it was both a creator of reality and a shield against it. And in some ways, it served as a route into understanding the world of advertising and the impoverished inner lives of those involved. It was a quick fix that both reflected and exploited a more profound emptiness. Phil Harrison Two college grads find themselves in hell – before their time, obviously, if you ask them – and the first thing they do is head into a sports bar full of demons and order some shots. There, they discover that the only way out of the underworld is to make it into Satan’s nightly party and drink him under the table. With its characterful bars, ridiculous cocktails and talkative strangers Afterparty is in some ways a tribute to the endless nights that alcohol can fuel. But it also reminds us that endless partying isn’t necessarily as fun as it sounds. Keza MacDonald Broadly, songs about heavy drinking either venerate the act or detail its long-term effects. Few attempt to do both simultaneously. But then Pulitzer prize-winning rapper Kendrick Lamar isn’t like most lyricists: his trap-adjacent single from 2012’s Grammy-nominated Good Kid, MAAD City Swimming Pools (Drank) flits between hypnotic party-ready anthem and sobering all-caps warning. The oddly pitched, chanted intro – “Pour up (drank) ... pass out (drank)” – initially sounds like your typical house party narrative, but it’s quickly tempered by verses that explore the perils of peer pressure. Later, Lamar’s conscience tries to shepherd him away from “the damage of vodka”. Deeply relatable. Michael Cragg Probably the least controversial book by the late philosopher, Roger Scruton’s 2009 memoir I Drink Therefore I Am: A Philosopher’s Guide to Wine is a splendidly convivial fireside draught. Looking back on his youthful travels in continental vineyards, Scruton self-deprecatingly calls himself a mere “wino” rather than a connoisseur, but argues seriously that good drink can be an aid – as modern “health fanatics” too seldom acknowledge – to good thought. A sweet hymn to Bacchus that also recommends the best wines to quaff while reading famous philosophers, and urges us to beware of the dangers of “drinking on an empty mind”.

12/13/2021,"The Biden administration admitted that a court decision did not compel it to lease vast tracts of the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling, shortly before claiming it was legally obliged to do so when announcing the sell-off, the Guardian can reveal.  Last month, the US government held the largest-ever auction of oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico’s history, offering up more than 80m acres of the gulf’s seabed for fossil fuel extraction. The enormous sale, which took place just four days after crucial UN climate talks in Scotland, represented a spectacular about-turn from Joe Biden’s previous promise to halt offshore drilling and was denounced by outraged environmental groups as a “huge carbon bomb”. The president’s administration insisted it was obliged to hold the lease sale due to a court ruling in favor of a dozen states that sued to lift a blanket pause placed on new drilling permits by Biden. But a memo filed by the US Department of Justice before the lease sale acknowledges that this judgement does not force the government to auction off drilling rights to the gulf. “While the order enjoins and restrains (the department of) interior from implementing the pause, it does not compel interior to take the actions specified by plaintiffs, let alone on the urgent timeline specified in plaintiffs’ contempt motion,” wrote government lawyers to the federal court in Louisiana in August. The issuance of new drilling permits would require further steps under federal laws, the memo states, adding that “the court’s order does not compel the agency to act in contravention of these other authorities”. Just a month after arguing that it was not required to hold the sale, however, the department of interior’s bureau of ocean energy management (BOEM) announced it would auction off an area of the gulf that is two times the size of Florida to oil and gas companies. The expanse of the gulf put up for auction contains around 1.12bn barrels of oil and 4.2tn cubic ft of gas, with the leases locking in years – and potentially decades – of planet-heating emissions. It comes at a time when the International Energy Agency has said no new fossil fuel projects can be established after this year if the world is to avoid catastrophic heatwaves, flooding and other disastrous impacts from runaway climate change. “The administration has been misleading on this, to put it mildly, it’s very disappointing,” said Thomas Meyer, national organizing manager of Food and Water Watch. “They didn’t have to hold this sale and they didn’t have to hold it on this timeline. “We know this will exacerbate the climate crisis, it undermines US credibility abroad and it contradicts a campaign promise by Biden. If the administration was taking the climate crisis seriously they would be fighting tooth and nail to keep every molecule of fossil fuel in the ground. They are nowhere near to doing that.” The auction, held on 17 November , ended up netting the government $191.6m from companies such as Exxon, Chevron and BP, the company responsible for the Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010. A total of 308 tracts of the gulf’s seabed were sold off, covering 1.7m acres, an area larger than the state of Delaware. The rapid staging of the lease sale was not required by the courts and could have instead been delayed by a proper federal review of climate and other environmental impacts according to Earthjustice, an environmental group that is suing to halt the leases before they come into effect in February. “Interior had a lot of discretion over whether to hold this lease sale and they chose to do it anyway,” said Brettny Hardy, a senior attorney at Earthjustice. “The Biden administration is talking about a climate crisis and getting to net-zero emissions and then it makes decisions like this that lock us into impacts for decades to come. These leases could potentially be producing oil 50 years from now. We have no good answer as to why they are doing this. It’s problematic and disappointing.” A spokesperson for the department of interior said that it was “complying with a US district court’s decision” in going ahead with the leases. He did not answer questions over why the government said in August that this court decision does not compel the auction. The decision to go ahead with the sale has damaged Biden’s climate credentials following the Cop26 talks in Glasgow where he said the US would “lead by example” in slashing greenhouse gas emissions. The president, who has called the climate crisis an “existential threat” to the US, said in a Democratic primary debate last year that under his administration there would be “no more drilling, including offshore. No ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period, ends, number one.” This jarring contradiction has alarmed even some of Biden’s closest allies, with three Democratic Congressmen filing a brief last week with the federal court calling for a halt to the gulf lease sales. The three admitted that they are “deeply concerned” and “shocked” that the government is pushing ahead with the drilling “despite its own findings that the largest lease sale in history has not had an adequate environmental review”. Biden has set a target for the US to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and the use of the huge amount of land and ocean overseen by the federal government is seen as key to this goal. The production and consumption of fossil fuels on federal land causes around a quarter of all American greenhouse gas emissions and a president has broad unilateral powers to limit or expand oil, gas and coal development. The Biden administration’s apparent reluctance to aggressively wield this authority may cost it politically, as well as worsen the climate crisis, ahead of midterm elections next year. “This is not going to help with Democratic turnout next year,” said Meyer. “There is a core constituency of young people and people who care about climate change who are upset and feeling betrayed by the Biden administration.” Some commentators have pointed to Biden’s need to appease senator Joe Manchin, a fossil fuel-friendly centrist Democrat who is a crucial vote for the president’s Build Back Better spending bill, as a reason for the ongoing drilling. “If it is political, that is unfortunate because the climate doesn’t really care about politics,” said Hardy. “Climate change will continue to cause problems for the whole nation if we don’t address it.”",News/Business,Revealed: Biden administration was not legally bound to auction gulf drilling rights,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/revealed-biden-administration-was-not-legally-bound-to-auction-gulf-drilling-rights
12/13/2021,"Maria Rios, 75, has worked as a food prep worker with contractor HMS Host at Phoenix Sky Harbor international airport for 17 years, where she makes $14.50 an hour. Her husband, who is retired, only receives about $400 a month in social security benefits. Rios would like to retire also, but she doesn’t have the option even as she is battling ovarian cancer.  When Covid-19 hit the US, Rios was one of thousands of workers in the food service industry who were furloughed, and was only recalled back to work a few months ago. While receiving unemployment assistance, Rios and her husband had to rely on food banks to have enough food to eat, and because she lost her health insurance along with her job, she had to skip cancer treatments until she was able to get Medicare, but still paid hundreds of dollars out of pocket for treatments. Her situation means that at a time when many might assume she should be enjoying a well-earned rest, she is still forced to work. “At 75 years old, I’m forced to still have to work to try to make ends meet. The healthcare the company provides is way too expensive and they’ve yet to provide a more affordable health insurance plan,” said Rios, who pays about $200 a month for her health insurance. “ It’s also very important for people to be able to have a pension too, to be able to retire with dignity so people aren’t forced to be in a position where I am right now, 75 years old and still having to work”. She even recently went on strike with her co-workers for 10 days, fighting for higher wages, more affordable healthcare and a pension. Media reports of older workers have often been framed as feel-good stories, such as a viral news report of an 89-year-old pizza delivery man who received a $12,000 tip raised by a customer out of remorse, as he works 30 hours a week because he can’t afford to retire on social security benefits alone. Or an 84-year-old woman who started a new job as a motel housekeeper in Maine in July 2020. Or an 81-year-old woman in Ohio who volunteered to start working at her favorite restaurant in November 2021 because it shut down temporarily due to an inability to hire and retain enough staff. But the grim reality is millions of Americans are working into their senior years because they can’t afford not to have a job. Over the next decade, the number of workers ages 75 and older is expected to increase in the US by 96.5%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with their labor force participation rate projected to rise from 8.9% in 2020 to 11.7% by 2030, a rate that has steadily increased from 4.7% in 1996. By 2040, the US population of adults ages 65 and older is expected to increase to 80.8 million from 54.1 million in 2019. The number of workers who retired during the pandemic was about 2 million more than expected. 50.3% of US adults ages 55 and older said they were out of the labor force due to retirement in the third quarter of 2021, compared to 48.1% in the third quarter of 2019, according to an analysis by the Pew Research Center. Though in recent months, the unretirement rate of US workers has gradually increased toward pre-pandemic levels. As the ageing US population grows, participation in retirement plans has declined since 2000. Nearly half of all families in the US have no retirement savings at all and inequality among Americans based on retirement savings is greater than income inequality. Over 15 million adults ages 65 and older are economically insecure, with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line, with Black, Hispanic and women ages 65 and older more likely to live in poverty. “I have no savings, no assets, I don’t even own the home I’ve been renting for 15 years,” said Dr Lisa Natale, 65, a chiropractor in Hawaii who put herself through school as a single mother. “There’s no way I could afford to retire.” With the average estimated social security retirement benefit in 2021 at $1,543 a month, even with a 5.9% cost of living adjusted increase for 2022, millions of Americans who rely on social security benefits are forced to continue working past retirement age in order to make ends meet. Kathy Luebbe, a 69-year-old teacher in the Cincinnati, Ohio, area, has continued working through retirement age because social security benefits and her partial pension only provide $2,600 a month, which is not enough to cover her bills and student loan payments. “I have to work just to keep paying my regular bills,” said Luebbe. Ted Newman of Columbus, Ohio, is a retired state government employee, but continued working full-time through his retirement, along with his wife, for the past eight years. “I have been working full-time for the last 8 years since retiring, and my wife also. Her yearly salary went almost completely to pay student debt and I worked to have extras for the home,” said Newman. When Covid-19 hit, his wife stopped working and he shifted to part-time due to health conditions. They paid about $1,000 toward parent plus loans for their daughter’s tuition for years, but still owe the principal of the loan. “Now our income is cut in half and our loans will be coming due again in 2022,” added Newman. “I can’t live long enough to pay the debt and plan to let it go to default because I can’t afford to pay it any more.” As the US population ages, with millions of Americans having no retirement savings, the number of older Americans with student debt, either for themselves or for children, is on the rise. Nearly 9 million Americans ages 50 and older still have student debt, and the amount owed by this demographic is growing faster than any other age group. In 2015, 40,000 Americans had their social security retirement benefits garnished for student loans. Jane Switchenko, 63, of Massachusetts, and her 68-year-old husband cannot afford to retire, in part because of parent plus student loans they took out for their children to attend college. “My husband and I must work until we die. Parent plus loans take over $1,000 a month, every month, for a decade now and we continue to see a rising balance,” said Switchenko. “Not only can we not retire, we cannot afford to fix our old house – we are desperate for new windows, have a leaking chimney and need new electrical work done.” She added: “We work hard. We are frugal, but we’re getting up there and have nothing to look forward to because of these loans. We have five grandchildren and don’t know what we’ll be able to buy for Christmas.” This article was written with the support of a journalism fellowship from the Gerontological Society of America, the Journalists Network on Generations and the RRF Foundation for Aging",Lifestyle/Money,"‘At 75, I still have to work’: millions of Americans can’t afford to retire",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/13/americans-retire-work-social-security
12/13/2021,"Nobody in MLS reached the level of Carles Gil in 2021. The 29-year-old was the conductor through which so much of the record-breaking New England Revolution’s play flowed. Without Gil, the Revs wouldn’t have been the regular season force they were.  German attacker Hany Mukhtar, whose 16 goals and 10 assists fired Nashville to an unexpected third-place finish in the Eastern Conference, deserves a mention, as does Minnesota United playmaker Emanuel Reynoso who dragged his team through a number of matches. But Gil, who ranked first in MLS for Expected Assists per 90 minutes, key passes, passes into the penalty area, progressive passes, through balls and goal-creating actions shone brighter than anyone. There is an unavoidable subjectivity to the assessment of a goal’s quality, but if social media views can be used as a sort of yardstick Jakob Glesnes’ thunderbolt for the Philadelphia Union against Atlanta United stands out as the most remarkable finish of the season. It also contained a pleasing audio element as his shot thudded off the bar and over the line. Raul Ruidiaz’s missile for Seattle away to Austin FC also warrants a mention, as does Rubio Rubin’s perfectly executed overhead kick for RSL against San Jose. While New York City lifted MLS Cup for the first time, the New England Revolution set a new standard at the top of the regular season standings, claiming the Supporters’ Shield by breaking the league’s single-season points record. Bruce Arena’s side boasted the MLS MVP in Gil, the league’s Goalkeeper of the Year in Matt Turner and a budding superstar in Tajon Buchanan, who secured a $7m move to Club Brugge in August. The Revs played a brand of attractive, attacking soccer that was as entertaining as it was effective. Of course, New England fell at the first hurdle in the playoffs, but the postseason isn’t necessarily where the best teams make their mark, certainly not in the case of the record-breaking Supporters’ Shield winners. Everyone in the league knows only three Designated Players are permitted per team. Everyone besides Inter Miami, that is. The Florida franchise had already endured a difficult start to life in the league when it emerged that they essentially had five DPs on the books. This fiasco resulted in MLS meting out a league-record penalty of $2m with a $250,000 fine issued to Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas (the league found no wrongdoing on the part of another of the team’s other part-owner, David Beckham). Sporting director Paul McDonough was suspended until the end of 2022 with Inter Miami’s allocation money for playing signings in 2022 and 2023 significantly reduced. It was an episode that could take the club a long time to recover from. Pablo Mastroeni did an exceptional job in difficult circumstances for Real Salt Lake, leading them to the Western Conference final following shock playoff wins over Seattle and Sporting KC, while Ronny Deila led NYC FC to MLS Cup glory. But the winner of this year’s award is a familiar name. After the debacle of the USMNT’s unsuccessful qualification campaign for the 2018 World Cup, many believed Bruce Arena to be yesterday’s man. However, the 70-year-old has enjoyed a renaissance since taking over at the New England Revolution, with his achievements this season ranking among his very best in MLS. The fairytale of Real Salt Lake’s postseason ended in the Western Conference final, where they suffered a comprehensive defeat to the Portland Timbers, but nonetheless, it was a captivating run that demonstrated how predicting the playoffs is close to impossible. First, Mastroeni’s side squeezed into the playoffs with a stoppage time winner against Sporting KC on Decision Day. Then they beat Western Conference heavyweights Seattle Sounders on their patch without having a single shot on goal before their penalty shootout victory. Next up they mounted a comeback from 1-0 down against Sporting KC with 18 minutes left to play. For three weeks, Real Salt Lake, who replaced their manager midway through year and are still without a new owner, were the talk of the league. Until Ryan Gauld’s arrival at BC Place in late July, the Vancouver Whitecaps had drifted through the 2021 MLS season. With the Scottish playmaker in their team, though, the Canadians found their groove, losing just two of the 19 regular season games played after his signing as a free agent from Farense in Portugal. Four goals and five assists in 19 games (14 starts) illustrated the immediate impact he made. Brian White also played a significant role in turning around the Caps’ campaign, arriving from the New York Red Bulls in the summer, but Gauld caught the eye more than any other new signing in the league in 2021. Vancouver fans surely can’t wait to see what the Scot, nicknamed ‘Mini Messi’ earlier in his career, does in a full season.",Sport/Football,MLS end of season awards: a fiasco in Miami and Glesnes’ thunderbolt,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/13/mls-end-of-season-awards-a-fiasco-in-miami-and-glesnes-thunderbolt

12/13/2021,"Hospitals are already operating at between 94% and 96% capacity, the organisation which represents NHS trusts has warned, as Sajid Javid said that there had been no known deaths from the Omicron variant in English hospitals so far. There were, thus far, 10 people in English hospitals with the variant, the health secretary said, stressing that even if Omicron turned out to be less severe overall than the Delta variant it is supplanting, the sheer number of cases would still put the health service under severe strain.  His comments came as Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said a shortage of social care staff and the removal of some beds to control coronavirus infections meant hospitals were trying to operate with 30% to 35% fewer beds. Hopson told Sky News: “For this time of year, the NHS is busier than it’s ever been before. That’s obviously a worry because it’s before the traditional winter peak in January and it’s before any kind of cases really coming into hospitals – that are now starting to do so – in terms of Omicron cases.” NHS Providers, a membership organisation that represents NHS trusts, said hospitals were already operating at between 94% and 96% capacity. Stressing the need for a massive increase in the number of booster jabs given during December, as announced by Boris Johnson in a televised address on Sunday evening, Javid said Omicron was spreading with enormous speed, already accounting for 40% of all Covid infections in London. Asked about deaths from the variant, he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I don’t know of any confirmed cases at this moment. There are 10 hospitalisations right now confirmed in English hospitals. There are some also in Scottish hospitals. “But in terms of hospitalisations and deaths, what we have learned about this virus is there is always a lag between infection and severe disease, hospitalisation and, sadly, death.” The “phenomenal” spread of Omicron was unlike anything previously seen in the pandemic, Javid said: “Many people are claiming this is less severe but let’s see, let’s establish the facts. Even if it is less severe, a smaller percentage of infected people experiencing severe disease is still a huge number if put against a large number of infections.” The “new national mission” of seeking to provide boosters, which have been shown to significantly increase protection against the variant compared with two doses, to as many adults as possible before the end of the month, would mean some non-urgent NHS appointments being postponed, Javid warned. “These decisions are not easy, but at any one time there is only limited capacity in the NHS,” he said, stressing that this should not affect anything more urgent, such as checks for people with potential cancer symptoms. On ramping up the booster campaign, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents the healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The health service was already under unprecedented pressure, and this is going to mean that other important parts of the NHS’s work are going to have to be put on the back burner in order to be able to deliver this.” He added: “It’s really important the government is clear with the public about the consequences this is going to have for what the rest of the health service is going to offer.”",News/World news,"Omicron Covid variant could overwhelm NHS even if less severe, says Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/omicron-covid-variant-could-overwhelm-nhs-even-if-less-severe-says-javid
12/13/2021,"Western Australia’s premier, Mark McGowan, has announced the state’s border will reopen on 5 February when double-dose vaccination is predicted to hit 90%, allowing for quarantine-free travel to the state. Here’s what you need to know before you book travel into WA.  All interstate travellers 12 years and older must be double-vaccinated, obtain a G2G pass and return a negative PCR test 72 hours before departure, unless you are ineligible or medically exempt.You will also need to carry out another PCR test within 48 hours of arriving in the state. There are different rules depending on the time you are intending to spend in WA. If you are travelling into WA for six days or more, then you must receive a negative PCR test within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival into the state. If you are planning on spending five days or less in WA, then you must receive a negative PCR test within 72 hours of departure and you will not be required to undertake any tests once you have arrived in WA. Anyone travelling who experiences symptoms of Covid must get tested immediately. Unvaccinated travellers will not be permitted to enter WA unless they are ineligible or medically exempt. Double vaccinated international travellers will not be required to quarantine but will need to return a negative PCR test 72 hours prior to arrival in the state. International travellers will also need to undertake another PCR test within 48 hours of arriving in Perth and on day six. If travellers are not vaccinated or have not received an approved vaccine, they will still need to undertake 14 days of quarantine at a hotel or at a designated facility. The cost of quarantining will be paid by the traveller. “There will be a cap on the unvaccinated, one that is significantly lower than the cap now in place,” McGowan said. Face masks are required on public transport, taxis or rideshares, at airports, on flights, in hospitals, and aged care or corrections facilities. Proof of vaccination is required for major events with 1,000 or more patrons, such as nightclubs and Perth’s casino. QR code check-ins must be used through the SafeWA app.Conditions will remain for entry into some Aboriginal communities. You will need to provide proof of vaccination when you travel into WA, attend events with more than 1,000 patrons and attend major stadiums, including Optus Stadium, RAC Arena, HBF Park and HBF Stadium. The date was chosen based on advise provided by health professionals and projections that 90% of people older than 12 will be double-dose vaccinated by 5 February. “We are very confident that by 5 February we will hit double-dose vaccination for the entirety of Western Australia,” McGowan said. Statewide, more than 200,000 people still need to get their second vaccination dose to reach the 90% mark. Currently, 57% of the Aboriginal population have received their first dose and about 40% are fully vaccinated. More than 90% of people aged 50 and over are fully vaccinated; about 82% of the 40-something population are fully vaccinated; 75% of 30–40-year-olds are fully vaccinated; for the 20-something cohort, 60% are fully vaccinated; for those aged 16 to 19 years, 63% are fully vaccinated; and half of all kids aged 12 to 15 have been vaccinated.",News/Australia news,"Vaccines, tests and why 5 February: all you need to know on WA opening up",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/vaccines-tests-and-why-5-february-all-you-need-to-know-on-wa-opening-up
12/13/2021,"Given the content of her smash-hit comedy One-Woman Show, there’s no little irony in interviewing Liz Kingsman. In the show, the Anglo-Aussie comic plays an ambitious, self-absorbed version of herself, here to share with us her formulaic (and, unbeknownst to her, blissfully funny) feminist monologue in the hope of emulating Phoebe Waller-Bridge and propelling herself from the fringe to the front page. And lo, here we now are, discussing how fantastic Kingsman is in a national newspaper. “I am extremely aware,” she laughs, “of the show eating itself. Anything that happens off the back of that show” – in career and profile terms, she means – “is extremely hypocritical of me.” Since One-Woman Show is a terrific piece of work, I’d advise Kingsman to brace for extreme hypocrisy: the comedy world is surely hers for the taking. But does she want it? One-Woman Show, it turns out, interrupted a process whereby, “I’d closed the chapter on live comedy.” Comedy fans know Kingsman mainly as one-third (with Stevie Martin and Tessa Coates) of the top-notch sketch group Massive Dad. “I’d never had any desire to make a solo show,” she says. She did so only because “my agent needed a script from me, and I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, I’ll definitely do that’ – then wrote this instead. This show is an elaborate form of procrastination for a different piece of work entirely.”  Its genesis, she says, was her observation that “suddenly, you couldn’t move for one-woman shows. I suppose a lot of women felt the only way they could get better auditions and have agency was to write a solo show. Which, after all, had worked for a number of high-profile people.” Kingsman sympathises with the impulse. Having once worked as a runner in the film industry, and as an occasional stand-in between takes for the likes of Felicity Jones (“I’m 5 ft 4 and brunette, which is a common demographic among actresses”), her acting career has traced a path via “lots of auditions for roles like ‘Dave’s girlfriend’ or ‘Steve’s wife’: quite two-dimensional, often eye-rolling women crossing their arms and not having any of the fun.” Faced with that, who wouldn’t create their own roles instead? But what interested Kingsman more was what she calls “the messy-woman genre” (think Fleabag – chaotic life, lots of sex, minimal sense of purpose) into which most of these shows fitted. Unlike Steve’s wife, these women “are having fun, are liberated and living their own lives. But the pendulum has swung so far back that way and got stuck. Because there are so many other female stories between those two poles. I don’t relate to those messy-women narratives. None of my female friends talk about their sex lives a lot. And I’d be hard pushed to find a single one who is aimless: everyone is hustling and working really hard.” Such was the thinking that led to One-Woman Show, which Kingsman was previewing in March 2020 as Covid struck. It’s been a frustrating wait to bring the full production to the stage, although “worrying that your show wasn’t going to be put on at a time like that,” says Kingsman, “felt like an insane champagne problem to have. I was more concerned about my entire livelihood going overnight. And I was worried that the zeitgeist would move on. I thought there’d be a Guardian think-piece about that genre, and my whole show would go down the drain.” Far from it: one of the many pleasures of One-Woman Show (aside from the sky-high joke count and self-mocking meta-commentary) is how ripe the “messy-woman genre” suddenly feels for satirical plucking – albeit, in Kingsman’s case, from the perspective of a fellow feminist respectful of the space that genre has staked out. Certainly, the show struck a chord – although Kingsman claims to have been oblivious to its phenomenal success at London’s Soho theatre in October, as it coincided with some film work. “In that first week, I was getting a train up to Manchester for filming after each show. I had to go to a country house, play dead – I’m literally a corpse in the film – then get back on a train to London, and do my show. So my head wasn’t able to process the idea of it being successful.” She’s processing it now – but ambivalent about what success may bring. “I’m so sleepy! I just want to go and play with my dog for a bit.” She hasn’t entirely forsworn live comedy, but “can’t imagine having another idea I want to pursue so fervently.” Acting and films are where her ambitions lie – she’s loving her (English-speaking) role in the French TV comedy Parlement, about the European parliament, and hopeful it will soon be broadcast to UK audiences. Might a Waller-Bridge-alike TV career be soon to blossom? And – more immediately – might the creator of Fleabag (itself launched at Soho theatre) be invited to Kingsman’s January run? She’d love One-Woman Show, surely? “Oh, I don’t think I can say,” says Kingsman. “I can’t speak for her. That’s the thing: women can’t speak for other women!” She laughs. “But it would be funny. I just don’t want to know what day she comes.” One-Woman Show is at Soho theatre, London, from 5-15 January.",Arts/Stage,"Take that Fleabag!
