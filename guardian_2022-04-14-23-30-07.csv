4/14/2022,"The day Russian troops invaded Ukraine, 18-year-old Oleksandr Ivanov was shot in the forehead and 10 times in the chest while in the passenger seat of his grandmother’s car. They had been driving to Hostomel, outside Kyiv, to pick up his grandfather and bring him to the capital. Oleksandr, known as Sasha, did not have the life of an ordinary 18-year-old. His mother, Sveta, was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy when Sasha was three. Sasha had spent his life taking care of her, helping her dress, wash and go to the toilet. Sasha had a natural love of learning, according to his family. From when he started to talk, he loved reciting poetry. At the age of seven he asked if he could learn to play the piano. Despite finishing music school with honours, he decided to study medicine. He attained full marks in Ukraine’s national high school exams for chemistry and biology and was given a scholarship to Ukraine’s best medical school, in Kyiv. Another top university, Taras Shevchenko University, also in Kyiv, rang his mother to complain when they heard he would not be coming to them. Sasha planned to become a neurosurgeon to help cure his mother’s disease, his family said. The bookshelves in Sasha’s bedroom in Kyiv are filled with thick textbooks and encyclopedias. For his birthday last year he asked for two books, Robert Brooker’s Genetics: Analysis and Principles and the British Medical Association’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary. His mother ordered them from abroad. “He didn’t drink, smoke or go out at night. He was a total homebody, a peaceful boy,” said Sveta, sitting in her wheelchair in Sasha’s bedroom. “He knew that I needed help and he would always run home after school to help me. When I was down or depressed because of my illness and he would pick me up and even give me massages. “There are children who like football or wrestling. My child loved books, chess and playing the piano, but no one ever forced him to study. But please don’t think he was stuck up. He’d plant potatoes with Granny, fix the roof with his grandad and change his cousin’s nappies. He was a simple, simple boy.” Sasha’s favourite films were the Hobbit trilogy and Bridget Jones, said his mother. When they celebrated Christmas at Sasha’s grandparents’ house in Hostomel last year, the Ivanov family could not have imagined what 2022 would bring. In a video his mother recorded from her wheelchair on 23 December, Sasha helped his earnest four-year-old cousin put decorations on the tree at his grandparents house. Less than a month later, in January, Valery, Sasha’s grandfather, had a stroke and was taken to hospital. The left side of his body was paralysed. When Russia invaded on 24 February, the hospital asked Valery’s wife, Lilia, Sasha’s grandmother, to collect him. Despite her children’s advice to bring him to Kyiv, she asked the ambulance to take him to their house in Hostomel, also home to a cargo airport that has been the site of several major assaults by Russian forces. “I thought he’d be safer there,” said Lilia. “How was I to know?” As the fighting raged on invasion day, Lilia decided that they should move to Sveta’s flat in Kyiv. But she needed help: her husband weighs 18 stone. Lilia, 60, could not lift him into the car alone. She drove to Kyiv early on the second day of the invasion to pick up Sasha. As they drove together back through Hostomel, Russian snipers fired at their car from a children’s park. Lilia and other people the Guardian has interviewed who were in Hostomel say Ukrainian troops were not in the town at the time, and they had seen a Russian column. “It was like there was an explosion inside the car. I saw Sasha’s head had fallen, like this, to one side. Then I blacked out. When I came to and I saw him, I just screamed out, I didn’t know what to do,” Lilia said. “I tried to prop up his head but my arm was floppy. I pressed on the pedal and we drove away. They were still shooting at us over and over and I felt I was losing consciousness again.” Lilia managed to drive another two miles before passing out at the wheel from shrapnel wounds. A boy came out on to the street and called an ambulance to take her to the nearest hospital, in Bucha – the city near Hostomel now notorious for Russia’s civilian massacres. There was nothing that could be done for Sasha. At the hospital, Lilia regained consciousness and rang Sveta. She told her Sasha was dead and his body was lying in the car in Hostomel. But the ordeal for Sasha’s family did not end there. His grandmother was now wounded in a hospital in Bucha and his paralysed grandfather was alone in the grandparents’ house in Hostomel. Both places were under Russian occupation. “I had to make a choice,” said Sveta, in tears. “Collect my parents or collect my son’s body.” She chose her son. “We were told they were blowing up the bridges and we had to do it now,” she said. Sveta and Sasha’s father drove to Hostomel surrounded by the thunder of shells. They found their son’s body, with one eyeball hanging out, in the car’s passenger seat. Eduard Lysovyk, who was later also shot by a Russian sniper, came over to the help. The three of them hoisted Sasha’s body into the family car. They drove to the police station to report the death, but the police would not come outside because the shelling was too heavy. They had to try two morgues because the first would not accept the body without a police report. The next day they buried Sasha in Bucha’s cemetery. There were no graveyard workers. Sasha’s father, Lysovyk and the head of the graveyard dug the hole themselves. Sveta, who can stand and walk for short periods, broke her leg while mourning over his open coffin. “I put his Tom Ford glasses in the coffin, along with his scrubs,” Sveta said. For 20 days, Lilia remained in Bucha’s three-storey hospital with terrified patients and doctors. When the shelling was bad, they moved into the corridors where they lay on the floor. There was no running water, heating or electricity. “We just ate frozen dumplings which were cooked on a fire outside,” Lilia said. “We had to get water from a well outside.” Eventually a generator was found. Despite having several shrapnel wounds and a paralysed arm, Lilia was one of the healthier patients and so she volunteered to help carry the generator up the stairs. “The Russians came in once and asked if any of us were Russian citizens or if any of us were Ukrainian soldiers. We all said no,” said Lilia. At one point she wanted to leave on foot to go to her husband who was still in their family home, but the doctors said she wouldn’t make it as she was too weak. After three weeks, an evacuation bus arrived. “Our bus and 60 others drove into Kyiv but the Russians stopped us on Zhytomyrska highway and started shooting us. We were stuck on the buses for two and half hours and there were jets flying over our heads. Then they let us go,” said Lilia. Valery, Sasha’s grandfather, was evacuated from his house in Hostomel to the family flat in Kyiv on 9 April. He had spent 44 days on his own, half paralysed, in the basement. A neighbour had braved the shelling to visit him once a day to feed him and help him to the toilet. “I just wanted it to stop,” said Valery, who sat up from the sofa in the Kyiv flat clasping his hands to his ears and sobbing. Lilia tried to soothe him. “You’re not there any more Valya, it’s OK.” Sveta said: “There are some families who the war hasn’t touched. But the war touched our family like nothing else. My mother is disabled, my father is disabled, I’m disabled, and I buried my son.”",News/World news,’Collect my parents or collect my son’s body’: a Kyiv family’s tragic plight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/collect-parents-or-sons-body-kyiv-family-tragic-plight-ukraine
4/14/2022,"Ammunition has exploded on board Russia’s Soviet-era missile cruiser Moskva, leaving the ship badly damaged and dealing a blow to Russia’s war effort. Ukraine claimed it had hit the ship with a missile and that the ship had started to sink. Russia has not acknowledged that the ship was attacked. It said the fire had been brought under control and the crew safely evacuated. It has not been possible to verify either side’s statements. Footage has not emerged of the ship since the fire. The Moskva was the pride of Russia’s Black Sea naval fleet and the most prestigious vessel involved in the war in Ukraine, making it both a symbolic and military target. Satellite images show the cruiser north-west of Sevastapol on 10 April … … and docked in port at Sevastopol on 7 April. The Russian navy has launched cruise missiles into Ukraine and its activities in the Black Sea are crucial to supporting land operations in the south of the country, where it is battling to seize full control of the port of Mariupol. On the diplomatic front, Russia said it would deploy nuclear weapons to the Baltic if Finland and Sweden joined Nato. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/14/2022,"Pregnant women in the northern Italian region of Piedmont could be paid €4,000 (£3,300) not to have an abortion under a proposal submitted by a far-right councillor, sparking condemnation from opposition parties and women’s groups. Maurizio Marrone, regional councillor for social policies, foresees the region giving €400,000 to anti-abortion associations, which in turn would make the money available to 100 women to entice them not to abort. “In Piedmont, 100 more children will be born,” said Marrone, a politician with the far-right Brothers of Italy. “Children who would not have otherwise come into the world because of their mothers’ economic difficulties.” The scheme was immediately condemned, with another Piedmont councillor, Sarah Disabato, describing it as a “substantial gift to anti-abortion propaganda”. “It is being disguised as aid for women who choose to have an abortion due to economic problems,” she said. Non Una di Meno, a feminist alliance, said it was disgusted but not surprised by the initiative, accusing Marrone of using women and their bodies for “squalid electoral and political positioning purposes”. “Motherhood is a choice,” the alliance wrote on Facebook. “A false promise of economic support won’t convince us, on the contrary, it represents a mockery and is manipulative towards those who are in economic hardship.” Abortion was legalised in Italy in 1978 under legislation called Law 194. However, women struggle to access safe abortions due to the high number of gynaecologists who refuse to terminate pregnancies for moral reasons. Seven out of 10 doctors in Italy are “moral objectors”. In addition, anti-abortion activists infiltrate hospitals to try to prevent abortions from taking place. Marrone, who said he would have liked to set aside more money for the scheme, last year allowed anti-abortion groups to set up counters in clinics by the local health authority, Asl, and hospitals in Piedmont. “It was not enough for Marrone to allow this, but now he announces €400,000 to associations that define abortion as the primary cause of femicide,” said Marco Grimaldi, a politician with the leftwing party, Free and Equal. A rightwing coalition made up of Brothers of Italy, the League and Forza Italia secured the leadership of Piedmont in 2019. The parties compete together in general elections, with the next vote due to be held in spring 2023. Brothers of Italy is polling as the biggest party in the country.",News/World news,Women could be paid not to have abortion in northern Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/women-could-be-paid-not-to-have-abortion-in-northern-italy
4/14/2022,"Hello, and happy Thursday, Over the last few months, an extraordinary standoff has been taking place in Ohio. And at the center of this dispute is Maureen O’Connor, the Republican chief justice of the Ohio supreme court. Republicans have tried four separate times to draw new state legislative districts. The state supreme court, where Republicans have a 4-3 majority, has blocked them three times (a fourth challenge is pending). The basis for all those rulings has been that the proposed districts are so skewed in favor of Republicans that they violate the Ohio constitution. The impasse is so severe that Ohio voters began voting in the state’s primary elections this month without legislative races on the ballot. In every ruling, O’Connor, who was Ohio’s lieutenant governor before being elected to the supreme court in 2002, has been the decisive swing vote, siding with her three Democratic colleagues. She has emerged as the last thread preventing her party from gerrymandering. That has infuriated some Republicans, who have called for O’Connor to be impeached, even though she is due to leave the bench at the end of this year because she has reached the mandatory retirement age, 70, for judges in Ohio. It's time to impeach Maureen O'Connor now. I profiled O’Connor earlier this week. No one I spoke with seemed especially surprised that she was bucking her party. In her 24-year political career, she has objected to the closure of abortion clinics, backed bail reform and aggressively called out her own party for criticizing judges. A decade ago, she dissented when the supreme court upheld Republican districts. “She’s no shrinking violet. She’s got sharp elbows,” Paul Pfeifer, a Republican who served on the supreme court with O’Connor for more than a decade, told me. “No amount of public criticism is going to change her mind if she feels that she’s right in the position she’s taking.” The refusal from O’Connor and the other three justices on the court is deeply consequential. In 2015, Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved adding language to the state constitution that says state legislative districts can’t be drawn “primarily to favor or disfavor a political party”. The makeup of the legislature, the addition said, should reflect the results of statewide elections in Ohio over the last 10 years – a 54-46 split in favor of Republicans. Republicans have blatantly ignored that. All the plans Republicans have proposed would enable the party to win at least 60% of the seats in the legislature – a veto-proof majority in Ohio. By refusing to accept those plans, O’Connor and the court are signaling that they are going to aggressively enforce the new language in the constitution. Politicians who gerrymander usually face no consequences. In a worst-case scenario, a judge will strike down their district lines, often after a few elections have taken place under them. But in Ohio, those who have challenged the maps want to ensure that future politicians don’t try similar shenanigans. They have twice asked the Ohio supreme court to punish – through fines or any other means – the members of the seven-person panel for ignoring the supreme court’s instructions to come up with a constitutional map. Such a finding would send an unprecedented warning to politicians about the consequences of gerrymandering. “This has gone from a battle over democracy in Ohio to a battle over democracy and the rule of law in Ohio,” David Pepper, a former chair of the Ohio Democratic party, told me. “No other citizens who violate the law four times get rewarded for it.” Also worth watching … Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, will take the lead on redrawing his state’s 28 congressional districts, an unusual move that could blunt Black political power in the state. An “insidious and coordinated” effort to undermine American democracy is under way, a new report has found. Democrats believed Joe Manchin was very close to supporting filibuster reform to pass voting rights legislation earlier this year. He ultimately did not.",News/US news,Ohio Republicans want to gerrymander the state.

4/14/2022,"Andy Warhol never goes away, but 35 years after his death, he is everywhere. There are The Andy Warhol Diaries and Andy Warhol’s America on TV, The Collaboration and Chasing Andy Warhol in theatres on either side of the Atlantic, while Christie’s is hoping to net a record-setting $200m (£152m) when it auctions a 1964 Marilyn screen print next month. Whole forests have been flattened trying to unravel the Warhol enigma – Blake Gopnik’s 2020 biography thuds in at 976 pages. Yet in just 55 minutes, Lou Reed and John Cale’s 1990 album and film Songs for Drella get to the heart of a man obscured by his wig, shades and blank expression. Their song cycle starts with Smalltown, a jaunty portrait of Warhol’s childhood in Pittsburgh, “Bad skin, bad eyes, gay and faddy” (or is it “fatty”?), through his hyper-productive golden era in the 60s, to his later years battling pain from the wounds sustained when he was shot by Valerie Solanas, author of the Society for Cutting Up Men Manifesto, alienation from collaborators and friends, and a growing dearth of ideas. All the themes biographers have subsequently treated as great revelations – Warhol’s Catholicism, his queerness, his relationship with his mother – are here, explored with taut precision and economy. Reed and Cale, of course, had a particular insight into Warhol. They were the creative engine of the Velvet Underground, the rock band the artist managed and produced and whose first album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, ignored on release, became a bible for glam rockers, drag queens, junkies and punks, and is arguably the most influential LP ever made. Given that Reed fired Warhol, then slung Cale out of the band a year later (not face to face, either – he got guitarist Sterling Morrison to do it) relations between the three men were less than cordial. Even the title Songs for Drella is ambivalent: Drella was a nickname used behind Warhol’s back, and which he didn’t like, a conflation of Dracula (the blood-sucking night creature) and Cinderella (the servant who goes to the ball). Yet without any sentimentality, Songs for Drella reveals the warm currents of respect and friendship that lay deep beneath the frosty surface. Warhol died suddenly in 1987 after routine gall bladder surgery, aged 58. Cale and Reed decided to make Songs for Drella after meeting at his memorial service – the first time they’d spoken in years. They finally performed its 14 songs in full at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York, at the end of 1989. Presumably with an eye on the combustible nature of the partnership, as well as on its great cultural significance, someone decided that this performance should be filmed for posterity. Enter the great cinematographer Ed Lachman. Now 76, Lachman photographed Far from Heaven and Carol for Todd Haynes, earning Oscar nominations for both films, and has worked with Sofia Coppola, Wim Wenders and Werner Herzog. It was, however, a music video that got him the Songs for Drella gig. “There was an Aids benefit compilation called Red Hot + Blue,” he remembers, Zooming from a colour correction studio in New York, he is squashed into a corner of the frame so all I can see is one lively eye and his fedora. “I was going to make a video with Derek Jarman and Annie Lennox, but Derek was too sick by then.” Jarman had been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1986, and was to become seriously ill making his 1990 film The Garden. “We met and he gave me home movies of his family when he was growing up, so I had the idea of projecting the images of his childhood over the white pancake face of Annie singing the Cole Porter song Ev’ry Time We Say Goodbye. It was gorgeous and it got a lot of notice, and that’s why Channel 4 came to me and offered me to do this concert.” Yes, the TV station about to be sold off by Nadine Dorries co-produced Songs for Drella, along with Sire Records in the US. Lachman had a meeting with Cale and Reed to discern whether he met with their approval. “Lou was very emphatic and said: ‘I don’t want to see any cameras on the stage and I don’t want cameras to be between me and the audience. Are you all right with that?’ So I said: ‘Well, I don’t know how I’m going to shoot the concert without any cameras.’ “I thought about it, came back the next day and said to them ‘Look, would you let me shoot two of your rehearsals on the stage with no one in the audience and I’ll shoot the performance but the cameras will be off the stage?’ And he agreed.” The result is unlike any other concert film. Lachman’s 16mm camera is so close to the two protagonists that you seem to be reading their thoughts – both about Warhol and about each other. Filmed when both men were 47, Cale looks aristocratic in a black suit and fabulous wedge haircut, while Reed serves disgruntled librarian in a black sweater and octagonal spectacles. Neither of them look like rock stars, and they’re both concentrating hard, facing one another while delivering the vocals (singing isn’t quite the right word in Reed’s case) and hammering on the piano or guitar. Though there are no drums on Songs for Drella, the music is often spiky and percussive – not least on I Believe, in which Reed startlingly declares that Solanas should have received the death penalty for shooting Warhol. In fact she got three years, which tells you something about the low regard in which gay lives were held, even famous ones. As with the Velvet Underground, the abrasive moments are leavened with others of intense sweetness – for instance Style It Takes, in which Warhol coaxes a gorgeous young thing into performing in one of his screen-test films, and which features the self-referential lines: “This is a rock group called the Velvet Underground / I show movies on them, do you like their sound?” At moments like this, the camera lingers on Reed and Cale’s faces. “Sven Vilhem Nykvist, the great cinematographer of Ingmar Bergman, said the face is the landscape for the camera,” Lachman notes. “If there were ever faces that could be landscapes it would be theirs.” Towards the end of Songs for Drella a mood of self-admonishment takes hold, for instance in A Dream, where Cale recites lines taken from Warhol’s diaries such as: “You know I hate Lou, I really do. He won’t even hire us for his videos, and I was so proud of him …” It’s at this point that you look even more closely at Reed and Cale. There’s so much to wonder about as you gaze at their inscrutable expressions. Can we discern regret at their meanness, both to Warhol and to each other, pride in the blazing mutual creativity of their youth, sorrow that it’s too late to do things differently? “It was not only a tribute, an homage, a eulogy, but it was also sort of a confessional,” says Lachman. To that end, Cale and Reed were filmed in near darkness, sometimes with Warhol’s artworks, or the New York Post front page that sneered “Pop goes pop artist” after the shooting, projected above them. “Cameramen like to separate people from the darkness,” Lachmnan adds, “but I wanted them to emerge out of the darkness.” Lachman had first met Reed years before – he had been enlisted to make a video clip for Reed’s baroquely gloomy 1973 album Berlin. “He came up to the camera when I was setting it up, kicked the leg of the tripod and said: ‘Do it like Andy’. I was horrified, I was trying to hold on to the camera that was about to fall on the floor.” By the time of Songs for Drella, Reed had sobered up. “I asked him if he remembered that, and he said ‘I don’t remember much from back then’, smiled and walked back to the microphone.” So what was the atmosphere like between Cale and Reed? Did they joke around? “What you see is what you got,” Lachman says. “They showed up and they did the work. I wasn’t hanging out with them after or before, I had my hands full. They didn’t go round the corner for beer.” Indeed, Reed and Cale fell out in the aftermath of Songs for Drella – “Lou always has to be in control,” Lachman notes – before making up and deciding to reform the Velvet Underground. The band toured Europe in 1993 (including, improbably, an appearance at Glastonbury) before Cale and Reed became estranged again. That was it until the band were inducted into the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, which turned out to be their final performance. Reed died in 2013, aged 71; Cale is now 80. He rebuffed approaches to talk about this film. Songs for Drella was broadcast on Channel 4 in 1990, a performance I recorded on VHS, and which seemed to my teenage self to be a transmission from a planet of cryogenic coolness. It’s lived deep within my bones ever since, so it’s a shock to hear that it had actually been “lost” since that first broadcast. In the US, it was released on a laser disc, then disappeared. Lachman tried to find the film while working on Todd Haynes’s documentary about the Velvet Underground, and finally located it during the pandemic, going through boxes of material he’d requested from the Motion Picture Lab in New York. “There, 100ft from my bed, was the actual original negatives, but no sound,” he says. Warner Brothers supplied him with the original sound mix, “and I was able through sound restoration to sync it up, and it now has the best possible sound it could.” The restored version now lives again on the streaming platform Mubi, and looks and sounds divine, Lachman filming each song in a subtly different way, some in monochrome, like the concluding Hello It’s Me, in which Reed expresses regret for the things he didn’t say to Warhol: “I wished I talked to you more when you were alive / I thought you were self-assured when you acted shy …” “For me, the camera has a taciturn observation, almost like Andy,” Lanchman says. “A lot of people felt Andy was a voyeur, some kind of svengali, but I think he was much more passive and he lived through the people that he made stars.” Of course, it’s Warhol’s presence above all that hangs over Songs for Drella, that tricky, far-sighted ghost summoned in the memories of those who knew him best. “I always felt that it was the spirit of Andy that brought John and Lou together,” Lachman says. “His spirit was still with them.” Songs for Drella is on Mubi from 17 April.",Arts/Art and design,‘They didn’t go round the corner for beer’: Lou Reed and John Cale’s Songs for Drella,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/14/they-didnt-go-round-the-corner-for-beer-lou-reed-and-john-cales-songs-for-drella
4/14/2022,"Most of the country will bask in fine and dry weather over the Easter weekend, with forecasters predicting that a new record for the hottest day of the year could be set on Good Friday. Temperatures are expected to rise to more than 10C above average, peaking at 22C in some parts of the UK. Richard Miles, a Met Office forecaster, said that although most places will experience fine and dry weather, areas in the north-west may experience the occasional shower, making eastern areas the most desirable destination for weather over the weekend. He said: “Largely it’s going to be pleasant until Sunday for most areas across the UK. The warmest weather will probably be on Friday, but it will stay well above average for most of Saturday and Sunday too. “The average temperature for this time of year is roughly 12C – so it will be around 10C warmer for an April day.” The warmest temperature so far this year was 20.8C recorded in London on 23 March, which means that the highs predicted for the south-east over the weekend would set a new record for 2022. Scotland is expected to be slightly cooler at 15C, while temperatures in Wales are expected to reach about 17C. However, a change is expected on Monday, with cooler and more unsettled weather to come. Neil Armstrong, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “A low-pressure system will affect the north-west of the UK later Sunday, bringing unsettled weather to the North with some strong winds and rain in the north-west, which could impact driving conditions for some, but further south it will be drier, especially in the south-east. “There will be varying amounts of cloud, but temperatures are widely likely to be above average for the time of year, although low cloud might keep temperatures lower in coastal areas. “However, where the sun comes out people can expect some very pleasant spring conditions.” In March, the Met Office updated the threshold as to what temperature is considered a heatwave by 1C across several counties in England between Surrey and East Yorkshire. Dr Mark McCarthy, the head of the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said that climate statistics over time had revealed an “undeniable warming trend for the UK”. “Temperature rise has been greatest across parts of central and eastern England where they have increased by more than 1.0C in some locations, while further north areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland have seen temperatures rise by closer to 0.7C,” he said. Earlier this month, leading scientists said that the UK government was moving too slowly when it came to tackling the climate emergency, in response to the latest IPCC report.",News/UK news,UK weather: highs of 22C expected during Easter weekend,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/uk-weather-highs-of-22c-expected-during-easter-weekend
4/14/2022,"Experimental, disabled-led theatre company Graeae here give us their first opera. Composed by Errollyn Wallen to a libretto by Nicola Werenowska and Selina Mills, The Paradis Files deals with the life of Maria Theresia von Paradis (1759-1824), a blind composer, pianist, singer and teacher, feted Europe-wide in her day and admired by, among others, Salieri, Haydn and Mozart. Much of her music is lost, and history primarily remembers her for her parents’ unavailing search for a cure for her blindness, rather than for her own often considerable achievements. Wallen and her librettists attempt to redress the balance by giving us a portrait of a self-determined woman of considerable spirit and courage. The primary focus falls on the relationship between Theresia (Bethan Langford) and her estranged mother, Hilde (Maureen Braithwaite), and the bulk of the narrative unfolds in flashback during a fraught, if eventually reconciliatory confrontation between the two women at the school for blind musicians that Paradis established in her 30s in Vienna. We witness the young Theresia fending off the attentions of her teacher Salieri (Ben Thapa) and rebelling against the ghastly regime of attempted cures imposed by quacks and specialists at her parents’ behest. The excitement of concert tours gives way to the tragic stillbirth of a baby, fathered by one of several lovers taken at the height of her career. A chorus of Gossips follows her every move, while her maid Gerda (Ella Taylor) consoles, comments and cajoles. Wallen’s eclectic score ranges allusively over different periods and styles. Quotes from Mozart and Clementi jostle with Viennese waltzes, and the names of Theresia’s lovers are gleefully reeled off in ragtime. It’s generally uneven and very close to pastiche at times, but there’s a touching duet at the midpoint for Theresia and her ambiguously motivated father (Omar Ebrahim), and some ensembles of great wit for the Gossips. The performances are strong. Langford, herself visually impaired, makes a terrific Theresia, passionate, dignified and resilient, her warm, insistent singing contrasting with Braithwaite’s refined intensity and Taylor’s greater brightness of tone. Ebrahim brings considerable gravitas to Theresia’s father, while Thapa is deeply creepy as Salieri. There’s fluid, elegant playing from a chamber ensemble from the BBC Concert Orchestra under Andrea Brown. Jenny Sealey’s clever, stylised staging, meanwhile, draws on cabaret and revue, and, in line with Graeae’s policy, incorporates British Sign Language and video captions, the latter ingeniously designed by Ben Glover.  Repeat performance on Thursday, then touring until 12 May.

4/14/2022,"Chamber works from the beginning and end of Debussy’s career – his only string quartet, composed in 1893, and the Sonata for flute, viola and harp, from 1915 – provide the points of reference in this collection from the Quatuor Voce, with the soprano Jodie Devos, flautist Juliette Hurel and harpist Emmanuel Ceysson. Juxtaposed as they are here, those two scores underline just how far Debussy travelled stylistically in less than a quarter of a century. Though the composition of his quartet coincided with work on the Prélude à l’Après-midi d’un Faune, the score that first announced him as a modernist, it is a far more conservative, almost backward-looking piece. Alongside the late sonata’s wistful musical shapes, its ever-changing play of sonorities and almost wilful changes of mood and direction, all shaped beautifully and elegantly in this performance, the quartet’s reliance on traditional forms and the use of the cyclical thematic methods of César Franck seem to place it in a very different expressive world altogether, despite the tremendous urgency and authority that the Voce’s performance gives it. Devos’s contribution is a performance of the four settings of Debussy’s own texts that make up the Proses Lyriques of 1892, with the original piano part arranged for quartet by Yves Balmer, so that the string lines twine seductively around her velvety phrases. Balmer also adds his own Fragments Soulevés par le Vent (Fragments Lifted by the Wind), three short movements of fragile, evanescent textures, which were commissioned by the Quatuor Voce to be an “echo” of Debussy’s quartet. It may not all add up to an essential Debussy collection but it’s a thoughtful and rewarding one nevertheless. The second Debussy disc from Alpha this month also juxtaposes works from different phases of the composer’s career. Mikko Franck conducts Radio France forces in the 1888 cantata La Damoiselle Élue, the composer’s first orchestral work to be performed publicly, alongside the three Nocturnes of 1899, and the four symphonic fragments that were extracted in 1912 from the incidental music to Gabriel d’Annunzio’s Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien. Franck proves to be a warmly expressive Debussy interpreter, emphasising the romantic background to Damoiselle Élue, and giving a warm glow to the Nocturnes; but he also finds just the right sense of hieratic detachment for the Saint Sébastien pieces, providing a reminder that there is nothing else quite like them in Debussy’s output.

4/14/2022,"Ibelieve we are, in Britain, on a continual walk towards a fairer society. Each new generation questions where fairness lies for them. The resulting conversations can be uncomfortable. Sometimes progress stalls. However, as an optimist, I believe this underlying thirst for fairness leads to a deeper understanding of one another and a more inclusive society. Back in 2019 – before I was elected master – Jesus College, Cambridge, set up a legacy of slavery working party (LSWP). We were not alone in this – many institutions are now re-examining their roles in the past and present and shining a spotlight on their histories. Our rigorous investigation uncovered much about individuals and objects historically linked to the college. And as a community we asked: what should we do with this knowledge, with this truth, in relation to wider issues of fairness today? In November 2021, we returned a looted Benin bronze to Nigeria. It was the right thing to do. Now, across Britain, Europe and the US, other institutions are following suit. However, an estimated 90% of sub-Saharan Africa’s cultural artefacts are still held outside its continent. The walk towards fairness still has a long way to go. Another strand of the LSWP’s work concerned our 17th-century benefactor Tobias Rustat. Its research exposed the extent of his 30-year involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. We used our website to inform people about Rustat. When presented with the evidence, the college’s council decided that his name should remain on the donor wall as a matter of historical fact. It was concluded that his crest should remain in an old hall window. Last, an overwhelming majority of fellows voted to apply for permission to relocate a memorial to Rustat from its prominent place of veneration in Jesus College chapel. This felt straightforward. From a moral point of view, Rustat’s activities helped finance the slave factories along the west African coast. This enabled ships to transport tens of thousands of enslaved women, children and men across the Middle Passage. And it led to these people being worked to death in the killing fields of the Caribbean and Americas. It also felt straightforward from a practical standpoint. The 2.65-metre high, 3.5-tonne memorial consists of eight pieces and has been moved on a number of occasions. The chapel has 500 years of history prior to the memorial being installed. Indeed, it hides an older architectural truth: a late-15th-century interior window through which masters looked into the chapel. Our intention was to relocate the memorial from a spiritual place to a permanent educational exhibition space in the college. Here, Rustat’s legacy could be properly considered, away from the heart of religious worship. The Church of England, however, has disagreed. After a small group of alumni objected to the plan, and after delays and a number of hearings, our formal application was considered at a contested hearing in the college chapel, with barristers representing each party and a single judge sitting in judgment. Last spring, the Church of England published its From Lament to Action document for tackling racial injustice. The church should have tested the moral case for relocating the memorial against the ethos of that document, which is urgent and ambitious. What should have been a simple decision turned into a convoluted consistory court process. The presence of the memorial is deeply offensive to many in the college community. Teaching them more about Rustat’s benevolence, as the consistory court judgment suggests, will not bring them back into the chapel. Rustat’s personal generosity pales against the mass rapes, torture and murders that occurred as a result of the transatlantic slave trade. An increasing number of students refuse to enter the chapel to pray, reflect, hear our wonderful choir, or take part in social and cultural events due to the presence of the memorial. For us it is vital that every student feels welcome throughout the college. In recent years, Cambridge has made great strides in opening up to students from a wider range of backgrounds. In Jesus’s most recent cohort, more than 80% of undergraduates are state school-educated, about a third identify as people of colour and a fifth are from areas of the lowest progression to higher education. Our community is changing. After the church’s decision to hold a consistory court hearing, Jesus College was in an impossible situation. There was no question: we had to fight this case. In doing so, the college will have spent about £120,000 on an antiquated process that it had little choice but to follow, dominated by lawyers, and which is ill-designed for resolving sensitive matters of racial justice and contested heritage. The church must develop something better than this. Throughout I felt that Rustat’s memorial was given more weight than the 150,000 African people he helped traffic into slavery. Having considered the judgment, I believe that this process is incapable of accounting for the lived experience of people of colour in Britain today. Encouragingly, we have received much support from across the country and the world. The open letter signed by more than 160 clergy in a recent Church Times article shows the extent to which many Christians disagree with the judgment, effectively saying, “not in our name”. As a college, we’ve been here before and managed change successfully. Just two generations ago, female students were admitted for the first time. Opponents cited 483 years of male-only access among other vehement criticisms. Their arguments were proved to be untenable. Buildings were repurposed and new arrangements and traditions created. As a consequence, the college is fairer and far more academically exciting today. I am proud to be master of an establishment like Jesus College. The quiet deliberation and conversation started by the fellows in May 2019 has not shied away from difficult subjects or this course of action. It is part of our walk towards fairness. It matters to Jesus College, and it ought to matter to the Church of England.
