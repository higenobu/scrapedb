3/5/2022,"Elizabeth Hurley, 56, just posted an update while recovering from a recent ankle injury. The actress looks radiant while resting at an Austrian resort. Elizabeth is a huge fan of found fitness and says gardening and logging help her stay fit. Elizabeth Hurley is glowing as she recovers from an injury at a swanky wellness spa in Austria. The Austin Powers actress posted a set of photos to her Instagram showing off the gorgeous view and her fit AF figure. ‚ÄúHelllooooo from @vivamayrmariawoerth ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù Elizabeth captioned the photos. VIVAMAYR Maria WoÃàrth is a medical health resort by Lake W√∂rthersee in Austria. Based on the number of photos of infinity pools alone, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a worthwhile investment for Elizabeth, and anyone else who can afford some medically induced R&R. Rebel Wilson has also visited this spot! Friends and fans were supportive of the 56-year-old actress. Makeup artist Sandy Linter wrote, ‚ÄúLooking fit and fancy üòç.‚Äù While others wrote ‚ÄúGorgeousness!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt agree more! How does Elizabeth stay fit and healthy? Well for starters, she takes her recovery time seriously. She flew to the Austria spa after tearing ligaments in her left ankle filming in the Caribbean in November. ‚ÄúLying on the sofa for two months, followed by a month of limping around in an air boot, meant that I basically became a slug. I don‚Äôt weigh myself but my jeans were objecting violently to being done up so something had to be done. Still not really able to put much pressure on my foot, meaning not much exercise, and a new movie looming, I decided to return [to the spa],‚Äù she wrote in a caption on Instagram. This spa taught her to chill, Elizabeth says. ""VIVAMAYR taught me to relax,"" Elizabeth said in a previous interview. ""I learned to sit still, put my phone down, and enjoy my food. My digestion has improved since I followed that advice."" While she may not be putting pressure on her foot, she‚Äôs definitely not skipping ab day. I mean have you seen these photos!? She‚Äôs also a big fan of ‚Äúfound fitness,‚Äù aka getting a workout in whenever and wherever you can. This can mean getting more steps in, or just getting her heart rate up on set. ""I don't really do any set exercise, per se, because I prefer to get my exercise from doing something than being in the gym,"" Elizabeth told Women‚Äôs Health. Liz‚Äôs fitness routine starts as soon as she wakes up. She does squats while she brushes her teeth to tone her legs and butt and then takes her dogs out for a 20-minute walk to get her blood pumping. She also loves gardening, logging, and raking leaves. You go girl! ""Not only do I feel, well, actually exhausted, but also I feel that I've got the leaves up, which is also a nice thing."" Liz says she‚Äôd rather ‚Äúscrub a mirror‚Äù than hit the gym because it does just as much. And if you‚Äôve looked at her recently, I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs on to something!

3/5/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) ‚Äî The family of a Northern California woman whose 2016 disappearance trigged an intensive search and international headlines on Friday criticized the way she was arrested on charges she faked her own kidnapping. Sherri Papini, 39, of Redding, was ‚Äúambushed‚Äù in front of her children Thursday afternoon, according to her family. She spent the night in the Sacramento County jail awaiting her first appearance on charges of mail fraud and lying to a federal agent. Papini disappeared while jogging in 2016. She turned up three weeks later, on Thanksgiving Day, alongside a highway about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from her home. She had a ‚Äúbrand‚Äù on her right shoulder along with burns and bruises. She described in great detail to police her abduction at gunpoint and abusive treatment by two ‚ÄúHispanic women,‚Äù triggering a hunt for her abductors. It was all a lie, authorities said Thursday. She actually was with a former boyfriend in Southern California, they said, and beat herself up to support her fabrication. Her family's statement did not address the veracity of the charges but said the family is ‚Äùconfused by several aspects"" of the counts. They also criticized how she was taken into custody. ‚ÄúWe love Sherri and are appalled by the way in which law enforcement ambushed her (Thursday) afternoon in a dramatic and unnecessary manner in front of her children,"" the family said in the statement released through a publicist. She would have come to the police station if asked, the family said, ‚Äúwhere this could have been handled in a more appropriate way.‚Äù Papini and her husband, Keith, have cooperated with investigators' requests, the family said, ‚Äúdespite repeated attempts to unnecessarily pit them against each other, empty threats to publicly embarrass them and other conduct that was less than professional.‚Äù Neither the publicist nor prosecutors knew whether she had an attorney to represent her. The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Sacramento declined to comment, while the Shasta County Sheriff‚Äôs Office did not immediately comment but previously said it would have nothing more to say now that charges have been filed. All three agencies investigated the case. Papini is charged with lying to a federal agent as recently as August 2020, when authorities said they confronted her with evidence that she had made up her story and warned her that lying was a crime. The mail fraud charge relates to the more than $30,000 she was reimbursed by the California Victim‚Äôs Compensation Board, including therapy ‚Äúfor anxiety and PTSD,‚Äù according to a court filing. It carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison, while lying to a federal officer has a maximum five-year sentence. A 55-page court affidavit supporting her charges says a GoFundMe campaign raised more than $49,000 to help the family. No charges are related to that money, which investigators say the couple used to pay off bills and for other expenses.",U.S./Associated Press,California family 'appalled' by arrest in faked abduction,https://news.yahoo.com/california-family-appalled-arrest-faked-193349124.html
