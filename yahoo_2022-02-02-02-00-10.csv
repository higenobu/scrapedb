However, their dad revealed that they lost over half the money by investing in bad stocks.  Join In The Know by Yahoo's Parenting Facebook group, where you can connect with other new parents, find trending content, product recommendations & more! “My dad promised to pay for my college education,” the teen wrote. “I made all my plans based on his promised aid, and I applied for early action for my dream college. I got in! Yesterday, he told me that he wouldn’t be able to help me at all, and he will help me get student loans.” Check out these pro tips for party-planning on a budget on this episode of Getting Rich, sponsored by Acura “I was really shocked because he had told me not to worry about it a month ago. I asked him what had happened, and he was deflecting before he admitted that he had invested the funds in some stocks and that he had lost money. He had promised me $70,000, and now he has something like $32,000.” The father assured them that the stocks would go back up, and he would be able to pay off the loans after college. But the teen didn’t want to hear it.  “I told him that he was being a loser right now, and it wasn’t fair that he lied to me for so long when he was just hoping that it would go back up. My mom is also mad at me because she says most people don’t get their parents’ support in college, and I shouldn’t be calling my dad a loser for offering to give me $32,000. I feel really ungrateful and spoiled.” Redditors understood why the teen was upset.  “They GAMBLED with your college education and lost,” a user commented.  “He invested in something as volatile and unpredictable as the stock market. That’s absolutely ridiculous and stupid of him to do,” someone wrote.  “Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” another said.  Shop In The Know cover star Storm Reid's high-fashion looks In The Know is now available on Apple News — follow us here!

2/2/2022,"A brawl involving dozens of people at a Golden Corral restaurant in Pennsylvania led to chairs and punches being thrown, video shows. The fight occurred Friday, Jan. 28, at the Golden Corral in Bensalem and police say more than 40 people were involved, according to KYW. No one was injured in the fight, Golden Coral said in a statement on Monday, Jan. 31. Video shows several of the restaurant’s workers intervening in attempts to break up the brawl. “All I wanted was some steak,” a person is heard saying in the video as the fight was de-escalating. The more than 3-minute video shows a crowd huddled in a corner of the restaurant when an argument escalates. Patrons begin tossing chairs, high-chairs and tables, while others start fleeing. One Golden Corral employee was struck by a table during the brawl, KYW reported. By the end of the video, the restaurant was filled with debris with tables overturned. Warning: This video contains graphic language. Police are investigating the cause of the fight, but one patron said it began when he received his steak before another customer. “(The cook is) trying to understand what you want and give you what you want,” Alexis Rios told WPVI. “I had a rare steak, which is a lot faster to cook than a well-done steak. That’s why I got my steak first.” Rios told the station he grabbed a chair to defend himself when the fight broke out. No arrests have been made as of Monday, Jan. 31, according to the Bucks County Courier Times. The restaurant was closed Saturday, Jan. 29, before reopening Sunday, Jan. 30, the publication said. Golden Corral said it was “saddened by the unfortunate disturbance.” “The safety of our guests and co-workers is our top priority, and we sincerely appreciate our loyal guests and fellow community members for their continued support,” the restaurant said in a statement.

2/2/2022,"Former President Donald Trump has urged congressional Jan. 6 investigators to open up a probe against his former vice president, Mike Pence, over his refusal to help Trump overturn the 2020 election result. Pence and Trump haven’t been on speaking terms since last year, when the then-VP went against Trump’s orders and fulfilled his duty to certify Joe Biden’s election victory in Congress. But their relationship plumbed new depths Tuesday, when Trump released a statement saying that Pence should be under investigation for not reversing the 2020 election result. In a furious statement posted by Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington on Tuesday, the former president once against attacked the House committee investigating the Capitol riot, and said the panel should be focusing on Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, rather than himself. The ex-president wrote: “The Unselect Committee should be investigating why Nancy Pelosi did such a poor job of overseeing security and why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval, in that it has now been shown that he clearly had the right to do so!” NEW!

President Donald J. Trump:

“So pathetic to watch the Unselect Committee of political hacks, liars, and traitors work so feverishly to alter the Electoral College Act so that a Vice President cannot ensure the honest results of the election, when just one year ago... pic.twitter.com/IagKnvPr5M — Liz Harrington (@realLizUSA) February 1, 2022 Trump’s obsession with Pence’s part in the presidential transition last year has been renewed in recent days as he’s seized on plans to reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887— the federal law that Trump tried to abuse to have Pence refuse to certify of Biden’s victory last January. Trump’s flawed argument is that, as a bipartisan group of senators now wants to overhaul the law to help clarify that it can’t be used in the antidemocratic way Trump intended, it proves he was right to say Pence should have stepped in last year to block Biden’s certification. In his Tuesday statement, Trump went on to say that “there would have been no ‘January 6’ as we know it” if Pence had simply refused to certify the Biden victory, and if Pelosi had heeded his warning to increase security on the day of the Capitol riot to deal with his mob of supporters. Last week, Pence made clear that he and Trump are no longer 0n good terms by telling Fox News that he hadn’t spoken to Trump since last summer. Trump’s latest intervention won’t improve matters.
