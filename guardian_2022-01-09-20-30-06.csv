1/9/2022,"Scotland’s largest parents’ organisation is calling for the SNP government to withdraw its schools’ health and wellbeing census, which has attracted opprobrium for asking 14-year-olds about their experience of anal sex. The controversial poll has united rightwing pro-family campaigners and progressive children’s rights advocates, with both groups fearing it may end up causing harm to the young people it intends to help.  The census, which is administered by local authorities and due to be completed this school year, has been declared “not fit for purpose” by Eileen Prior, the chief executive of Connect. The survey has previously attracted disapproval for asking secondary pupils in senior 4 and above about relationships and sexual health, with one much-reported question asking pupils to list how much sexual experience they have had, ranging from kissing to vaginal and anal sex. Prior has written to the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, asking them to withdraw the survey “until it takes a children’s rights approach, which has clearly been missing”. Raising particular concerns around pupils’ privacy and informed consent, Prior echoes recent comments from Scotland’s children and young people’s commissioner, Bruce Adamson, who urged the Scottish government to pause the introduction of the survey “until it can ensure a rights-compliant process”. In the letter, seen by the Guardian, Prior raises a succession of serious concerns about the survey, which asks pupils in primary and secondary schools a range of age-related questions. The information commissioner is investigating data protection concerns about the census, with at least 10 councils unilaterally deciding to withdraw or review it. On privacy, Prior notes “mixed messaging” for parents and pupils. Despite several declarations of confidentiality, “the information gathered clearly makes children and young people identifiable at school, local authority or national level”, she says, with young people asked to fill in their unique Scottish candidate number and parents told this may be used to identify a young person “in exceptional circumstances”. Subjects covered in the census include attitudes to play, exercise and school work, as well as body image, mental health, alcohol, drugs, bullying, relationships and sexual health. Prior also argues there is a “very heteronormative slant” to the questions, such as using the terms “girlfriend” and “boyfriend”. More broadly, she questions why “policymakers need to know about oral sex”. Other questions relating to mental health are “deeply personal and potentially very upsetting for vulnerable children and young people” she says, adding the census lacks sufficient advice for parents and teachers on supporting young people detailing traumatic events. She also asks why the surveys were not tested on young people, why guidance was not sought from youth organisations, and sets out “deep concerns” that young people are not given clear enough information on the contents or purpose of the survey, or how their data will be used. Asked about the chorus of criticism at first minister’s questions last month, Sturgeon stressed that the census was not mandatory for local authorities to use in school, and that both parents and pupils could opt out. But she added her government had a “serious responsibility” to ensure that public services were informed by lived experience. Sturgeon said: “Either we can bury our heads in the sand and pretend that young people are not exposed to the issues or the pressures that we know they are exposed to. Or we can seek to properly understand the reality that young people face and provide them with the guidance, the advice and the services they need to make safe, healthy and positive decisions. I choose the latter.” A Scottish government spokesperson said: “Parents/carers and children and young people are informed of how their data will be used in advance of any taking part in the census and they can decide to opt out if they wish. If children and young people do take part, they can skip any question they don’t wish to answer or state that they would ‘prefer not to say’. “Whilst the Scottish government has worked with stakeholders to design a set of questionnaires, it is for local authorities to determine which questions they ask.”",News/UK news,Nicola Sturgeon urged to scrap census asking teenagers about anal sex,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/nicola-sturgeon-urged-to-scrap-census-asking-teenagers-about-anal-sex
1/9/2022,"“Iam not a man for soldiering, although I do tolerably well at it in a very minor role. But there is nothing about it that pleases me, and much that offends … It is a corrupter of morals in the widest sense and a gross waste of man’s time and effort.” These words were written by George Devine, the actor and founding artistic director of the Royal Court theatre, in a letter to his wife from Burma, where he served in the second world war. The views he expressed reflected what his family – and many in the arts world – regarded as his essential humanity and compassion.  So, half a century after his death, they were shocked to discover among his possessions an item that appeared to be a trophy taken from the body of a Japanese soldier. A battered suitcase discovered in a neglected cupboard contained medals, chess pieces, eyeglass lenses – “pieces of him”, said his great-grandson, George Pritchard. But it also held “something utterly out of place: a piece of someone else”. The item was a Japanese flag inscribed with good luck messages by the soldier’s relatives, neighbours and community figures. Yosegaki hinomaru were carried into battle by their recipients, and were believed to hold the owner’s spirit. Who did this flag belong to, and how did it end up in Devine’s suitcase? A three-year search for answers to these questions is the subject of a documentary, Hinomaru: Homecoming of a Flag, made by Pritchard, which won best short documentary at the Tokyo International Short Film Festival last month. “We didn’t really know what it was when we found it, but once we started researching we began to realise its significance,” Pritchard, 26, told the Observer. “It was a shock. It was out of touch with his character. It definitely threw things for us in the way we viewed him. So I needed to get to the bottom of it, and figure out what actually happened.” During the war, Devine was a captain in the Royal Artillery based in Burma and was twice mentioned in despatches. In 1954, he co-founded the English Stage Company, a radical theatre company that began staging new plays at the Royal Court. Its first big success came the following year with John Osborne’s Look Back in Anger. Devine later wrote that his objective was to persuade “writers of serious pretensions back into the theatre”. He died in his prime following a heart attack in 1966, aged 55. In 2017, when family members unfolded the newly discovered flag, they found hand-written messages radiating from the national symbol of a red circle, representing the sun. It was typical of yosegaki hinomaru, which were given to young men setting off to war by their communities. There are numerous accounts of Allied soldiers taking such flags from the bodies of dead Japanese troops as souvenirs. According to one memoir, “the men gloated over, compared, and often swapped their prizes. It was a brutal, ghastly ritual the likes of which have occurred since ancient times on battlefields where antagonists have possessed a profound mutual hatred”. In recent years, hundreds of yosegaki hinomaru have been returned to families, often in highly emotional circumstances, through the work of the Obon Society, a charity dedicated to peace and reconciliation. Pritchard wanted to track down the flag’s owner, but “I didn’t know where to start”. He spent hours examining war records at the national archives to plot the movements of Devine’s regiment and eventually, in a “huge breakthrough” helped by a Japanese academic, identified the name and the home town of the soldier. The young film-maker wrote letters to people of the same name in the town, local officials and a nearby shrine. Finally, after months of painstaking research, contact was made with the soldier’s family. But the mystery of how Devine acquired the flag was still to be unravelled, and a few further twists were yet to come. In the end, both families – Devine’s and the Japanese soldier’s – had learned more about the past and their loved ones. The 25-minute film is the first Pritchard has made since graduating from the University of the Arts in London. “I funded this entirely myself, it’s been a passion project. People from university helped me out. I lived at [my parents’] home for the time it took, working in a pub kitchen, saving up enough money to go out there,” he said. He had always known that his great-grandfather was “a fairly big deal in terms of theatre history, but I hadn’t really looked into it until this flag turned up. Now I definitely appreciate him more”.",Arts/Culture,Mystery of the second world war ‘trophy’ and the Royal Court founder ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/09/mystery-of-the-wwii-war-trophy-and-the-royal-court-founder
1/9/2022,"At 9pm, on a Sunday in early May last year, almost one in four of us on our scared, fractious, divided island hunkered down to watch the finale of the sixth series of the BBC police procedural Line of Duty. It was the largest television audience for a drama in Britain since modern records began almost 20 years ago. It was also a rare moment of mass connection, between genders, ages and demographics, that usually only occurs during football tournaments or the Olympics. One that felt especially heightened because of the crappy, house-bound year we’d all just lived through. Mainly, though, it was just fizzing, nerve-jangling TV. The woman at the centre of it all, DCI Joanne Davidson, also known as the 45-year-old Scottish actor Kelly Macdonald, was not one of the 16 million people watching. For the previous six episodes, we’d tried to figure out just how much of a bad egg she was – whether she was a “bent” copper, in the lingo of the AC-12, Line of Duty’s dogged anti-corruption unit. The denouement was a true water-cooler moment, even if many of us had not seen a water cooler, or even a colleague, for 15 months.  So Macdonald really didn’t watch it? “Nooo,” she replies, looking horrified by the notion. Why not? “If I don’t watch something at the time, at, say, a premiere, it’s not something I’m going to go out of my way to do. I’ve got other things to do. The dishwasher always needs unloading.” Macdonald is hardly a stranger to big productions. She made her debut in the 1996 instant classic Trainspotting, opposite Ewan McGregor, and has gone on to work with directors such as Robert Altman in Gosford Park, Martin Scorsese, in a five-year stint in the TV series Boardwalk Empire, and the Coen brothers in No Country for Old Men. Her latest movie, the feature film Operation Mincemeat, about a secret project in the Second World War, sees her share top billing with Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen. Still, being the “guest” lead on Line of Duty – a role previously taken by Keeley Hawes and Thandiwe Newton – took Macdonald aback. “Oh my God, it was all a bit much for me,” she says, her eyes wide, when we meet in a hotel in central London. “It’s just of such interest to everybody. And everybody’s got an opinion. Everybody seemed to be watching it. I’m used to flying vaguely under the radar when it comes to things I’ve done. And it was a strange time, with Covid, so it was a shock to the system. “I was warned by people I was working with,” she continues. “They were like, ‘Are you ready for this?’ And I thought I was, but it was more than I expected. I was very grateful for wearing a mask when I was out, I tell you that much.” Macdonald was superb in Line of Duty, vacillating between tough and vulnerable, never an easy read, always offering a suggestion of both guilt and misunderstood naivete. This was especially evident in the penultimate episode of the series where DCI Davidson endured a gruelling, uninterrupted, 30-minute interrogation with the AC-12 trio of Steve Arnott (played by Martin Compston), Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) and Anna Maxwell Martin’s DCS Carmichael. The scene felt like an age, in televisual terms, but the payoff, as the intensity ratcheted up and up, made it one of the most iconic moments in Line of Duty lore. For Macdonald, who spent two intense days filming the scene, it was a satisfying moment: proof, 25 years after her exhilarating arrival in Trainspotting, of what she’s capable of as an actor. “I got to do the thing that I was cast to do, so it was a good day at the office,” she says. “It was the scene that everyone kept talking about nonstop when we were filming, and I put a lot of hours into preparing for it. I knew why I was there. And I knew that I was doing it. And I suppose it’s one of the most dramatic, emotional scenes I’ve had to do…” Macdonald stops – she’s getting uncomfortably close to talking about acting in a pretentious way (which she hates). “You just sound like such a wanker when you talk about this stuff. But you asked!” I did, and with some encouragement, Macdonald goes on: “I used to think my prep was just to stress myself out and lose sleep and think I can’t do it. Then hopefully prove myself wrong. And oh, it’s exhausting and pointless. But that’s just age. I know it’s in me to do it and I’ve been doing it for a long time, and to just let it happen rather than trying to second guess it, because you can’t really.” Macdonald lets out an anguished yelp. “So wanky!” So, in short, Macdonald sweats stuff less than she used to? “Yeah, definitely, I sweat less,” she says. “Having said that, I am perimenopausal possibly, so I’m definitely sweating more.” Macdonald explodes in giggles: “But metaphorically, I sweat less.” Macdonald never trained as an actor, unless you count endlessly rewatching Doris Day in the 1953 musical Calamity Jane as a child and then acting it out. “I would try and get friends involved, but nobody knew it as well as me,” she says. “So it was quite tricky.” Born in Glasgow’s Southside, Macdonald’s parents separated when she was nine and she moved on to a council estate on the outskirts of the city with her mother Patsy and her younger brother. She left school at 16, and was working in a bar, aged 19, when she was handed a flyer for an open-call audition for “the new Patricia Arquette”. The movie was Trainspotting, Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel about a group of heroin-addicted Edinburgh miscreants. Thousands tried out and Macdonald made it to the final two for Diane, a sassy schoolgirl. “I remember getting on the bus after my final audition,” says Macdonald. “It was a screen test and I left their makeshift studio that we filmed in on Alexandra Parade [in Glasgow], and I waited for the bus and I sat up on the top deck. And I knew it was between me and one other person. And I sort of knew I’d got it. I had a feeling: ‘This is my life starting now.’ It was a clear fork in the road.” Macdonald pauses, hugs her stomach and looks apologetically at my Dictaphone. “Yeah, sorry, I’m really rumbling, I hope you’re not picking that up,” she says. “I had a very disappointing croissant for breakfast.” Dressed today in a Bella Freud “1970” jumper, with matching red lipstick, Macdonald is funny and winningly self-deprecating. When I call her a “film star” she visibly bristles. “I just don’t think of myself as a film star,” she says. “I felt it a bit checking into this hotel, I didn’t even check in. They were all very nice and met me and I thought, ‘Oh God, they think Tom Cruise is here.’ I’m not that person. Like, I’m fine. I can make my way from the train station, I’m good.” Tom Cruise would insist no one else stayed in the hotel, I suggest. “Yeah, I haven’t seen anyone else,” Macdonald says, smiling. “It’s been quite quiet. Maybe Tom Cruise is like, ‘Kelly can stay here. But no one else!’” Whatever she says, Macdonald is a film star and her new movie Operation Mincemeat shows again what a dexterous, unshowy performer she is. The action retells a far-fetched true story about a covert MI5 team that was charged by Winston Churchill in 1943 to come up with a plan to convince the Germans that the Allies intended to invade Greece not Italy. At their head was a pair of “corkscrew thinkers”, Ewen Montagu (Firth) and Charles Cholmondeley (Macfadyen), who devised an audacious ruse to pass off an already dead homeless man as a British officer who was travelling with secret documents when his plane crashed. Macdonald’s Jean Leslie is a smart, resourceful MI5 secretary who worked closely with the men, including hashing out a detailed backstory for the officer and supplying a personal photo that was left on the body as a suggestion of the sweetheart he’d left behind. Operation Mincemeat proved to be a turning point in the Second World War, and is now regarded as one of the most inspired and strangest military deceptions. “It’s bonkers,” says Macdonald. “I feel like if it was an original idea, the screenwriter would have lots of objections from producers and people saying, ‘Oh, this is not believable. Nobody’s going to buy this.’ Yeah, you couldn’t make it up.” The real Mincemeat team became tight, Macdonald’s Jean and Firth’s Ewen especially so. This is a Second World War story not of mud-caked battles and rations, but of romance and intrigue. Nights were spent dancing in the Gargoyle club in Soho, with its interior designed by Henri Matisse and Edwin Lutyens. “Jean’s not just the woman in the office,” says Macdonald. “She’s having a wartime experience like a lot of women were having. It was a very dark time, but there was also this grabbing of life by the nuts, not to be too crass. That thing of living it, while you have it.” Macdonald describes Operation Mincemeat as a “big, shiny job”. That means? “The catering changes,” she says. “You get slightly nicer cars to take you to work instead of vans.” There was also money to splash on dance lessons for Macdonald. “That was amazing fun, to learn that stuff with a real dancer,” she says. “I really enjoy it, so the more dancing the better. Not Strictly, though.” So Macdonald is ruling herself out of a future appearance on the show then? “I don’t know why I even mentioned that, don’t mention that!” she replies. “I said it like I was putting myself forward as a dancer. I’m really not!” Outside work, Macdonald lists her main interest as: “I move furniture.” She lives in Glasgow with her two sons, Freddie, 13, and Theodore, 9, (she shares custody with her ex-partner of 14 years, Dougie Payne, the bassist in Travis), and moved house this year. I ask Macdonald to clarify “move furniture”. “I don’t move other people’s furniture,” she says. “It’s not like a side job I’ve got: Macdonald’s Movers. No, I move furniture too much. It’s getting slightly to be a problem. And the kids don’t even think about it, they walk in and go, ‘Oh, that used to be over there.’” Macdonald sighs, and decides it’s just the stage of life she’s at. “I’ve started growing my own flowers,” she says. “I’m gardening. It’s all falling into place.” The work continues to roll in. Macdonald’s just filmed a road movie with Gina McKee, directed by Carol Morley, called Typist Artist Pirate King. She is also very happily sending herself up in the English-language remake of the hit French comedy Call My Agent! In the transfer, she plays a character not a million miles from actor Cécile de France in the original, who is turned down for a role in a new Quentin Tarantino film because she’s too old. “I had a very Call My Agent! moment, actually, when my agent was telling me about the part I was going to be playing,” she says. “And she couldn’t get the words out and then I realised it was the Cécile de France storyline-ish but different.” For someone who couldn’t envisage ever becoming an actor and who, even when she got her break, couldn’t foresee it becoming her career, Macdonald has – even she accepts – done all right. Earlier in our conversation, she said that, if she weren’t doing what she does now, she thinks she might have been a journalist. So then, as our time winds up, how would she finish the article? “My son is having to do essays at the minute where the last paragraph has to start with ‘in conclusion’,” she says. So, in conclusion…? “In conclusion, I’ve not concluded yet,” Macdonald decides finally. “And yeah, we’ll see how it goes.” Operation Mincemeat is released on 22 April Fashion editor Jo Jones; makeup by Liz Pugh at Premier Hair and Makeup; hair by Paul Donovan using Kérastase; fashion assistant Peter Bevan; shot at the Rosewood Hotel",Arts/Film,"‘I’m used to flying under the radar’: Kelly Macdonald on fame, family and being herself ",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/09/im-used-to-flying-under-the-radar-kelly-macdonald-on-fame-family-and-being-herself-
1/9/2022,"The middle ages are a sort of paradox, write the authors of this engaging history. “When people want to kick a current problem back into the past – whether Islamic terrorism, bungled responses to Covid-19, or even the process for getting a driver’s licence (it involves a lot of bureaucracy) – they call it ‘medieval’.’’ So too do white supremacists, who look to the middle ages to seize on “golden and glorious artefacts, big castles and cathedrals when they want to claim an origin story for whiteness”. Part of the reason for this is because the thousand-year period that followed the sack of Rome in the 410s has often been thought of as the dark ages, a “centuries-old understanding of the medieval world” that still pervades popular culture and evokes an “isolated, savage, primitive medieval Europe”. Matthew Gabriele and David Perry set out to provide a corrective, setting out “a new story” of “the Bright Ages” that stresses continuities over change, and emphasises connections and mutual influences over exceptionalism.  The authors essentially address the subject chronologically, picking out individuals to illustrate a wide range of talents and achievements – such as Galla Placidia, the patron of the gorgeous chapel that is one of the glories of Ravenna; or Bede, the industrious monk in Northumbria whose accounts of early England are so important; or Ibn Rushd and Moses ben Maimon (better known as Maimonides), outstanding scholars of the 12th century, whose works were hugely influential. Misconceptions and bugbears are addressed with gusto, such as the 16th-century scholar Giorgio Vasari, blamed for coining the term gothic as “a negative description of medieval art”, or Charles Homer Haskins, whose concept of the “12th-century renaissance”, which is almost 100 years old, is misleading and casts women as well as “non-Christians and non-white people in the shadows”. Edward Gibbon is upbraided for longing for “a purer Italy” while gazing at Rome’s ruins “as a dilettante traveller” and thus coming up with the classic “ages-old idea” of the collapse of the Roman empire. In fact, the authors argue provocatively, “Rome did not fall.” Gabriele and Perry, both medieval historians of considerable distinction, are writing here for non-specialist readers, drawing on references to the modern world that range from Hollywood movies to blockbuster video games, from the Ku Klux Klan’s terminology to the flags waved during the storming of the US Capitol in January 2021. They write with spirit and a breezy style that makes for an enjoyable read. We learn that the Vikings were “snazzy dressers”, that the fall of Jerusalem to the First Crusade in 1099 was met by many Muslims with “a collective shrug”, and that many who went from “west to east and east to west” at the time of the rise of the great Mongol empire were seeking to “forge a military partnership based in realpolitik”. This makes the book and its themes easily accessible – the merits of which the authors themselves seem to sometimes be uncertain, with the reader being repeatedly reminded that history is not straightforward, but complicated and complex. Such is the price of reaching outside the halls of academia, and something the authors are to be commended for. Given Gabriele and Perry’s determination to be inclusive and retell the story of Europe’s “Bright Ages”, it is a shame, then, that there is no coverage of half of the continent’s histories, peoples and cultures. Poland and Hungary, political and cultural powerhouses in Europe in the middle ages, are absent, while Kievan Rus’, which stretched from the Baltic to the Black Seas, appears briefly and only in passing. The two Bulgarian empires and the Great Moravian empire are not even mentioned. Most strikingly of all, the eastern Roman – or Byzantine – empire, its scholarship, art, literature, politics, trade and religion is effectively (if implicitly) dismissed as an irrelevance to Europe, rather than an essential and deeply rooted part of its history, if not its very core, for some or even all this period. These omissions attest to a wider problem of how history has been used to exclude those who do not fit into the triumphant narrative of the rise of the west – ironically the very thing The Bright Ages sets out to challenge. What the authors have done well, they’ve done very well and with passion and verve, challenging the reader to tackle assumptions, bias and prejudices about the past to create a more joined-up, inclusive picture of the thousand years that followed the sack of Rome. But I, for one, would sing from the rooftops if Gabriele and Perry penned another volume that looked at – or simply included – the poor cousins in the half of Europe whose rich and important pasts remain firmly enveloped in darkness, rather than bathed in light.

1/9/2022,"Dawn Basciano’s ancestors arrived five generations ago in Coloma, California, as enslaved people, forced to leave behind an infant son enslaved to another family in Missouri. Those ancestors, Nancy and Peter Gooch, were freed in 1850 when California joined the union as a free state, and 20 years later, their son and his family were able to join them in the fertile agricultural land north-east of Sacramento. Their journey west was funded by the sweat and hard work of Nancy, who grew and sold fruit, mended clothes and cooked for the local miners.  Nancy and her descendants would go on to purchase more than 400 lush acres of farmland in Coloma. But what should have been a story of triumph ended instead as a tale all too familiar to formerly enslaved Black Americans across the US. The state of California seized the majority of that land under the guise of eminent domain to build a state park, and the family never received just compensation. “We were denied the financial security and wealth associated with land ownership,” Basciano said. Pearley Monroe – Nancy’s grandson, and Basciano’s great-grandfather – spent the rest of his life mourning the loss. Now, the story of Basciano’s family and others are under review by a California reparations taskforce. The first of its kind in the nation, the committee is tackling the daunting and unprecedented work of recommending reparations – whether they be monetary or through policy – for Black Californians, particularly those who are descended from enslaved people. Shirley Weber, the California secretary of state, who authored the law that formed the taskforce, has said California must forge its own path on the thorny topic of reparations, an issue the federal government has tried and failed to resolve for decades. “We came to understand very clearly that California has the ability and the power to do it,” she said at a public hearing in June. “And if not us, then who?” The taskforce was formed in 2020 after the legislature and Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, approved a law requiring the study and development of reparations proposals. Since then, the nine-person taskforce, comprising civil rights leaders, attorneys, lawmakers and academics, has spent months gathering evidence, listening to expert testimony, hosting public meetings and considering proposals, with the goal of submitting its recommendations to the legislature next summer. The taskforce is undertaking this vast challenge with the knowledge that the historic injustices suffered by the descendants of slavery are deep, systemic and difficult to quantify. “The economic injustices, the education injustices, the social injustices, the judicial injustices go on and on and on,” said Weber in June. “We must be aggressive in our efforts to be honest and direct and to figure out what we need to do in California and be an example to the rest of the nation in how we begin to reckon with ourselves.” California’s unique history with slavery and its aftermath has made addressing reparations a particularly complicated task. Though California joined the union as a free state in 1850, 11 years before the civil war, many who took to the Sierra Nevada foothills during the Gold Rush in the years before statehood brought enslaved people with them. While the state constitution proclaimed “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for punishment of a crime, shall ever be tolerated”, the legislature passed a fugitive slave law in 1852 that allowed those who had been brought to California before it became a free state to be returned to the south. In one case that went all the way to the state supreme court, a slaveholder brought a man, Archie Lee, to California after statehood and after the fugitive slave law had lapsed. But the courts argued that the slaveholder was so “young and ignorant” of California’s laws that he should not be deprived of his human property, Stacey Smith, an associate history professor at Oregon State University, testified at a public taskforce meeting in September. Other experts testified about the years of discrimination that followed after slavery was abolished, from environmental racism to the state’s history of redlining – a discriminatory practice of denying financial services to specific people to prevent them from moving to or living in certain areas – and how discriminatory housing practices led to segregation in schools. They also testified about the Great Migration, when millions of Black Americans fled the south and Jim Crow to places like California, hoping for a better life, but found instead “structural barriers of exclusion” like restrictive housing covenants that forbade homeowners from selling to Black people, said Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America’s Great Migration. “The caste system followed the migrants wherever they went and became not merely a southern phenomenon, but a national one,” she testified. Black Californians also faced rampant racism in the communities where they tried to settle. Wilkerson spoke of how after Emory Hestus Holmes, a second world war veteran, purchased a three-bedroom home for his family in Pacoima, California, in 1959, the neighbors led a relentless harassment campaign in an effort to get them to move away. They prank-called them at all hours, threw rocks through their windows, burned a cross on their lawn and spray-painted on their garage: “Black Cancer Lives Here, Don’t Let It Spread”. Early on in the process, the taskforce reviewed other examples of reparations programs throughout the world. Germany paid $89bn in restitution to Holocaust victims while the United States paid $20,000 each to the 82,219 Japanese Americans who were unlawfully incarcerated during the second world war. In 2015, the United States authorized payments of up to $10,000 per day – a total of $4.4m each – for the dozens of people taken hostage in Iran in 1979. A Kirsten Mullen, co-author of From Here to Equality, told the taskforce that following that same math, the payment for one Black American who endured a single decade under Jim Crow would be $36.5m. But the challenge before this taskforce is that so many of the injustices suffered and opportunities lost by Black Americans “can’t be quantified”, Weber said at a September meeting. Weber’s father was a sharecropper in Hope, Arkansas, who had to flee to California after he tried to organize for fairer wages. Descended from enslaved people, his community had been terrorized into deference following a number of race riots that ripped through the country. “You can’t quantify my father’s lack of education and the negative experience that he had just trying to survive for himself and his family,” Weber said. “You have to begin to say, OK, what do we do in terms of opening up this particular society in a way that really makes an effort to create the opportunities not just for those who are here but also for the next generation to come? Weber added: “You can’t buy that with $20,000.” The scale of the injustices under assessment by the committee is almost inconceivably vast. Given stolen land and housing discrimination alone, Black Americans were denied the greatest source of family wealth today – home ownership, Wilkerson testified. This robbery of family inheritance and generational wealth has created a wealth gap between Black and white Americans that some studies say would take 228 years to close. For Dawn Basciano’s family, the loss was enormous. Not only did they lose the majority of their farmland on her paternal side – land that would have provided steady employment for extended family as well money and legacy – her fourth great-grandmother on her mother’s side had assets unfairly taken from her as well when her brother died and the state auctioned off the swaths of property he owned in downtown Sacramento under the pretense that he had no living heirs or descendants – “although his sister, my fourth great-grandmother, was alive and well”, Basciano testified in September. “What do reparations look like? There is so much,” Basciano said. “I almost feel guilty for feeling the pain that I feel, but it’s real. It resonates with me. This is my family. These are the stories that have been told and retold, and it hurts. How do you fix that? How do you right a wrong that is so systemic?” Basciano pointed out that there were hundreds of thousands of families that had stories like hers. In September, Newsom signed a law that would return a lucrative beachfront property in Manhattan Beach, California, that had been taken from the Bruce family in the 1920s through eminent domain. The Manhattan Beach city council had voted to oppose issuing a symbolic proclamation to apologize to the Bruces, citing concerns it would make the city liable for future lawsuits. Though any recommendations made by the taskforce will not be binding, Weber urged its members to be bold in their proposals, including universal preschool for all children to help address educational and childcare inequities. Other witnesses and experts have suggested monetary reparations, low-interest loans, public apologies, just compensation for stolen land, the return of historically stolen land and ways for descendants of slavery to attend university at no cost. The taskforce will continue to meet in the new year. Weber acknowledged that whatever the body comes up with will probably only be the beginning. “This 400-year challenge is not going to be solved in 400 days,” Weber said. “It will take much more than that, and a commitment from the state of California, the fifth-largest economy in the world, to make that happen.”",News/US news,"‘If not us, then who?’: inside the landmark push for reparations for Black Californians",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/california-reparations-slavery-african-americans
1/9/2022,"In the Russian-Jewish community of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn in the 1980s, gay yeshiva student David (Samuel H Levine) is having an identity crisis. Closely monitored by his overbearing parents, he moves in with his newly widowed grandfather, Josef (Ron Rifkin), on the basis that he will complete the building’s “minyan” – the minimum number of people needed for communal worship. Josef’s apartment is only a few blocks away, but in such a tight-knit community it might as well be another country. From this new home, David begins to explore his sexuality, taking the train to a gay bar in the East Village, embarking on an affair with a gorgeous bartender, and reading James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room in the local library. The film’s bluesy woodwind score has a teasing, goading quality that feels tinged with melancholy; the spectre of Aids hovers around the film’s edges. What’s most interesting about Eric Steel’s tender coming-of-age drama is the queerness hiding in plain sight. When fixing the toilet of the two men who live next door, David clocks that there’s only one bed.

1/9/2022,"Acall to arms from Richard Fenton in Katowice in Poland. “‘Missing in action’ is the term used to describe the situation of someone who has gone into battle and failed to return and whose fate is otherwise unknown. As such, the term describes someone who has done, or tried to do, their duty. So why is it being used to describe politicians who are deemed not to have done what was expected of them? “I suppose terms like ‘skiving’, ‘shirking’ or ‘swinging the lead’ are a bit too direct, although the latter could be dressed up as ‘inclinata plumbum’.”  I confess that I hadn’t noticed this, but Mr Fenton is spot on. Consider the following recent headlines: “Republicans missing in action as Democrats emotionally commemorate Capitol riot anniversary”; “World Bank under fire for being ‘missing in action’ on climate change”; “Rishi Sunak ‘missing in action’ as hospitality venues face closure”; “Boris Johnson is missing in action and is not up to job as Prime Minister”. You get my drift. I think Mr Fenton would agree with me, therefore, that the perpetrators should be put on jankers. Condign punishment is the only answer. Ditto for the author of the following: “While you may think onboarding only takes place the first few days on the job, it actually begins before a new hire starts and extends through the first month. And employees are 58% more likely to stay in a role for three years or more when there is a strong onboarding program. That’s why we put together this complete guide to virtual onboarding, so you won’t miss a step.” That drivel comes courtesy of LinkedIn, and was brought to my attention by Duncan H Brown after I wrote about this execrable term. Thank you, comrades Fenton and Brown, I feel that I’m not a lone voice crying in the wilderness.

1/9/2022,"Force Majeure, Ruben Östlund’s 2014 film, is, on the face of it, begging not to be adapted for the stage: it involves a majestic alpine landscape and skiing – and that’s just for starters. It is also an uncategorisable, ambiguous narrative that risks being misunderstood and that, in the wrong hands, could have turned out to be a snowy bellyflop. But it’s precisely because of its high-risk content that this show is a triumph and a wonder to behold. Director Michael Longhurst and his tremendous cast have pulled off a dazzling production that entertains and unsettles, and Tim Price must take a bow too, as his adaptation is even more nuanced than the film. In front of us, a snowy mountainscape (designer Jon Bausor) is bathed in icy blue light (Lucy Carter) and framed by a gauzy proscenium arch as though to say (a matter pertinent to what follows): this is engineered, this is theatre, keep your head. The skiing issue is stunningly resolved as the more balanced of cast members swoop dynamically down the slanted stage into the stalls, while others stay put and practise on-the-spot, sporty, disco-like choreography with neon-bright skis.  All this – the flashing skis, the bodies bent double like bunnies, the frenzied Vivaldi soundtrack – might make you laugh with pleasure, but what happens next will wipe the smile off your face. The story hinges on a single false move: Tomas, brilliantly played by Rory Kinnear with blokeish pallor and a bordering-on-terminal lack of self-knowledge, is on a family holiday, and, after a first day on the slopes, is having lunch with his wife and children when what is understood to be a deliberately engineered avalanche swoops down – no problem, except it appears to be out of control. Tomas grabs his phone and runs away from his wife and children. His act might be small and forgivable – a shameful reflex – except that he denies it, won’t apologise, and it becomes a potentially all-encompassing, defining betrayal. The story is partly about shifting scale: is Tomas’s action a detail or a domestic avalanche? Lyndsey Marshal is marvellously convincing as Ebba, his honest grafter of a wife who, at first, laughs hysterically as her way of expressing hurt. Their children (Florence Hunt and Henry Hunt) are astonishingly natural, bickering with each other and suffering their parents fallout. Their skiing friends, Sule Rimi as Mats and Siena Kelly as Jenny, who juggle related issues about trust, are amusing too, and Nathalie Armin is spot-on as Charlotte, self-appointed femme fatale of the slopes. Throughout, the actors slalom between slapstick and trauma and their slippery story never misses its footing. Folk is based on the life of Cecil Sharp (1859-1924), who was a Hampstead resident and a Cambridge-educated collector of English folk songs – an important but controversial enterprise. Nell Leyshon’s new play centres on Sharp’s encounter with two sisters, Louie Hooper and Lucy White, who worked as glovers in Somerset. Her plot is like an unaccompanied voice: fine, subtle and carrying. For the sisters, folk music is a mother tongue (they learned it from their mother, who has just died as the play opens). It is their living heirloom. But after Louie has given Sharp custody of the songs, she reacts with disbelieving horror at the mediocre aspic of his settings. His cultural appropriation is, for her, personal theft. But it is too late to take back her gift about which the real Sharp wrote, presumably to quell his conscience: “exchange is no robbery”. As Louie, Mariam Haque is wonderful: intense, stricken and inward, an unselfconsciously blunt critic of Sharp’s music, her face comic when most underwhelmed. Her unforced naturalness as a singer brings out the starkness in the folk songs, their unmediated appeal to the heart. Sharp is plausibly played, too, by Simon Robson, as a condescending enthusiast who applies himself to the piano with aplomb. And as Lucy, Sasha Frost gives a vivacious performance as she grabs life amorously by the lapels – or, more specifically, handsome young layabout John (robustly played by Ben Allen). Subtract the “g” from glover, her teasing eyes seem to say, as she hand-stitches the gloves. Roxana Silbert directs with homely simplicity, supported by musical director Gary Yershon, and the result is a charming, touching, unusual evening that asks: who owns folk song? I wished only that we were not confined to a basement theatre. This play pines for fresh air – what a wonderful outdoor piece it would make – with a field or three in view.
