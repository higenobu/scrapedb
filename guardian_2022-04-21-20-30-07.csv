4/21/2022,"Authorities in Tibet are building massive Covid isolation and care facilities in anticipation of further outbreaks in China even though the remote territory has only reported one case during the pandemic. Temporary hospitals – a key feature of China’s Covid response – with at least 1,000 beds each are being built in Lhasa and Shigatse by Chinese firm Jiangsu Qi’an Construction Group. The firm said it was tasked with building the hospitals in late March and given “less than half a month” to complete them. More than 400 personnel are working across three shifts to get the job done. The development in Tibet, which has been governed as an autonomous region of China since it was annexed in the 1950s, came as Shanghai declared some districts to be Covid-free at the social level, meaning all cases were found inside quarantined facilities, raising hopes that the city had turned a corner and could soon emerge from lockdown. However, authorities on Thursday afternoon said tough restrictions would stay in place across the city, including those districts which had contained the spread. China’s national health commission has ordered that all provinces in China should have two to three makeshift hospitals to house and treat people with mild or asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 and reduce pressure on the hospital system. “Even if there is no construction now, we must come up with a construction plan to ensure that when the makeshift hospital needs to be activated, it can be built and put into use within two days,” officials told media on 22 March. At that stage there were 33 hospitals built or under construction across 12 provinces. As Omicron, the much more transmissible variant of the disease, has spread around the world, some jurisdictions’s hospitals have been overwhelmed by the number of cases. In Hong Kong, the effect of the outbreak was compounded by an earlier policy that saw all positive cases sent to hospital, regardless of severity. China and Taiwan, both of which also had that policy, have since removed it and are isolating mild or asymptomatic cases at other facilities, in hotels, or, in Taiwan, at home. China’s current outbreak, the worst since Wuhan, is currently concentrated in Shanghai. On Thursday the city reported 2,634 local cases, and 15,861 asymptomatic cases. There were almost 1,000 total cases spread across other regions, mostly in Jilin and Jiangsu. Shanghai authorities reported another eight deaths on Thursday, bringing the official total from the outbreak to just 25, despite widespread reports from residents of people dying after getting Covid-19. China’s health authorities appear to have held a high threshold for attributing a death to Covid-19 when there are underlying health conditions, a position which has been questioned by international experts. On Thursday Associated Press also reported shifting definitions of an asymptomatic case, confusing not just how deaths are now counted, but Covid cases themselves. China remains committed to zero-Covid but has begun emphasising a target of eliminating cases outside quarantined areas and facilities, even if the count inside quarantine remains high. On Wednesday, authorities in Shanghai declared two districts to have no cases outside quarantined facilities, a target which was expected to lead to the reduction of some lockdown restrictions. Shanghai’s lockdown has been criticised by residents who have complained of widespread food shortages, delivery delays and increased prices for daily essentials. More than 16 million people remain in lockdown. On Wednesday, a city health official, Wu Qianyu, said 7.85 million would now be able to walk outside or return to work in factories, a rise of 2 million from last week’s exceptions. “Community spread has been effectively curbed,” Wu said of the districts. However authorities on Thursday said tough measures would remain in place.

4/21/2022,"Donald Trump has said he did not storm out of an interview with Piers Morgan, instead claiming the British television presenter misleadingly edited a video of their meeting to create a buzz around his new show. A short clip released on Wednesday to promote talkTV, the new Rupert Murdoch-owned TV station, gave the impression that the former US president walked out of an interview with Morgan in anger at the tough line of questioning. The Murdoch-owned Sun and New York Post tabloids ran reports of the supposed bust-up as front-page news stories, as part of a carefully planned global marketing strategy for Morgan’s new show that launches on Monday. On tomorrow's front page: Donald Trump stormed out of a world exclusive interview with Piers Morgan in a blazing rowhttps://t.co/UxFHVIgi5O pic.twitter.com/Fs9CYYaCcs Trump’s team claims the clip was misleadingly edited to give the impression Trump shouted “turn the camera off” while rising from his chair in anger. Audio provided by Trump’s team to US media outlets suggests that in reality the comment was made after the pair exchanged pleasantries at the end of the chat and was then edited for dramatic effect. Taylor Budowich, Trump’s spokesperson, said: “This is a pathetic attempt to use President Trump as a way to revive the career of a failed television host.” The mutually dependent relationship between Trump and Morgan has produced multiple interviews over the years, often generating headlines that keep both in the public eye. The premise of Morgan’s new national show is that the presenter will be a fearless individual who says the things that are now impossible to say on national television. Promotional interviews for Piers Morgan Uncensored, which will earn its host tens of millions of pounds over the course of his contract, have shown him repeatedly complain about “cancel culture” and compare “woke” policies to fascism. Morgan’s personal approach to marketing the programme involves picking fights on Twitter with liberal or leftwing critics in the hope of provoking a reaction. One part of Morgan’s interview with Trump really did not go to plan, after an unknown individual handed over a dossier of critical comments Morgan had made about the US president in recent years. In a surreal twist that shows the extent to which politics and the media are becoming increasingly entwined, it appears the individual responsible for the dossier was the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage. He hosts a rival evening show on the rightwing channel GB News and will be competing with Morgan’s show for many of the same viewers. In a video posted to his YouTube channel, Farage recalled visiting Mar-a-Lago days before the interview took place and telling Trump that Morgan had “gone around boasting in the UK media” that he was his friend while also “stitching you up”. Speaking on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday morning, Morgan appeared to delight in Trump’s claim that the advert for the interview had been deceptively edited. Morgan, who was once sacked as editor of the Daily Mirror for publishing fake photos, said: “He says it’s a rigged election, and he now says I have a rigged promo. What I would say is watch the interview. It will all be there. We won’t be doing any duplicitous editing. “The promo reflects exactly what happened. Donald Trump got very angry about one particular thing and he couldn’t let it go. But when people see the interview they’ll see that we have nice exchanges. We always have done before. But simmering is this anger he was feeling about what was said to him before we started the interview.” The presenter quit ITV’s Good Morning Britain last year after refusing to apologise over comments he made about Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. He has said he is not right wing “but a fairly frustrated liberal” who had been a victim of cancel culture. In the end, the self-described “narcissistically self-promotional” Morgan told the Lorraine show he was delighted with Trump’s furious reaction to the interview, due to the publicity it was creating: “I said to my team, the only way this can get bigger is if I wake up in the morning to a personal statement from Donald J Trump. [At] 5 am my phone rattled, and there it was!”",News/US news,Donald Trump denies storming out of Piers Morgan interview,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/21/donald-trump-denies-storming-out-piers-morgan-interview
4/21/2022,"Nestlé, the owner of KitKat, Häagen-Dazs and Felix cat food, raised its prices up by 5.2% in the first three months of this year and has said rising costs will force it to increase them again soon. Mark Schneider, its chief executive, said: “Cost inflation continues to increase sharply, which will require further pricing and mitigating actions over the course of the year.” Nestlé is the latest major brand owner to warn on the impact of rising prices of raw ingredients combined with higher energy, fuel, labour and transport costs. Greggs the bakers, Dove and Marmite owner Unilever, and fashion chain Next are among those who have warned of more inflation on the way. Fears of shortages of cereals and sunflower oil from Ukraine as well as petrochemicals from Russia have added to existing inflation caused by soaring energy and fuel prices and a bounceback in demand since pandemic restrictions eased in many parts of the world. Schneider said Nestlé had seen “strong organic sales growth” as it had increased prices “in a responsible manner” in the three months to reflect significant cost inflation. The company confirmed it expected to meet full-year sales and profit targets amid sustained consumer demand. Prices rose most for Petcare products, up 7.7%, followed by water, up 7.2% while confectionery rose 3%. Underlying sales, excluding the Russian region where the group has halted sales of non-essential goods, rose 7.6%. Purina PetCare was the largest contributor to underlying growth, with sales rising by more than 10% in Europe as the pandemic-led rise in pet ownership rolls on while sales of confectionery including KitKats rose by more than 10%. Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:“Hiking prices to keep things moving in the right direction in the wake of input cost inflation certainly won’t be a course of action management want to have to take. But nonetheless, it’s the position Nestlé finds itself in and doesn’t look likely to go away anytime soon.” He said Nestlé’s sales were being helped by the recovery of cafe and convenience store sales which were affected by pandemic restrictions last year, but that effect was likely to unwind in future. Britzman added that Nestlé had yet to see any real impact from changes in consumer behaviour from the cost of living crisis which might prompt a switch away from international brands to cheaper supermarket own-label goods.",News/Business,Nestlé warns of new price rises as inflation soars,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/21/nestle-warns-of-new-price-rises-as-inflation-soars
4/21/2022,"Australia has refuted claims that Australian security forces deployed to Solomon Islands’ capital Honiara to quell last November’s riots were instructed not to protect Chinese-built infrastructure. The claim was made by former Solomon Islands prime minister, Danny Philip, who is now the chair of the current government’s, foreign policy advisory subcommittee. Speaking during a webinar hosted by Georgetown University’s Center for Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Studies and the University of Hawai’i’s Center for Pacific Islands Studies, Philip said his country’s new security agreement with China was born of a desire to protect Chinese assets in the country in case of future unrest. “A very senior diplomat from the Australian High Commission, said very plainly to us that their presence here was not to protect any Chinese interests, this needs to be verified but as a government it was said to us in no uncertain terms they are here not to protect Chinese investments, Chinese infrastructure. “So that gives rise to other considerations in the minds of the Solomon Islands government to get the Chinese police to come in and train our own police … to handle the situation such as we have last November.” Asked if this was the primary goal, he said the agreement was also aimed at protecting Solomon Islanders too. The Australian high commissioner to Honiara, Dr Lachlan Strahan, said the claim was incorrect, pointing out that under Australia’s bilateral security treaty, Australian police and military personnel were subject to the command of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. “Suggestions that Australian officials refused to provide security support to Chinese built infrastructure are incorrect. “Australia’s security deployment is at all times conducted in accordance with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force’s (RSIPF) priorities and direction. Our forces sit under RSIPF command under our bilateral security treaty, and we do not discriminate in the delivery of our security support,” he told the Guardian. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chair of the Solomon Islands’ parliament’s Foreign Relations Committee and a member of the opposition, Per Kenilorea told the panel that he didn’t believe the agreement was necessary or that his country would benefit from it. “The agreement is one that I don’t feel that we need at this time. Solomon Islands won’t benefit as a nation from it. I say that because of our size, we are 700,000, our police probably about a 1000 police officers. “The issues that have been affecting us have been focused on Honiara, much of Solomon Islands is still a peaceful country. “Much of the problems recently … are linked to politics and political issues that have led to flare ups and unrest, so I just don’t think a treaty or diversifying our security will add value to our current security arrangements and set up. “So I don’t think is a path we should take or that it is a path would benefit Solomon Islands. I think the biggest winner here will be the People’s Republic of China, in terms of a foothold in the Pacific region. Another member of the panel on Islands Security Agreement and Blue Pacific (in)securities, leading Solomon Islands Academic, Dr Transform Aqorau said it was concerning that no one outside the government had seen a copy of the signed agreement or been provided with any detail of its content. “I personally don’t see anything wrong with the idea of an agreement with donors to training and equipping the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) … to ensure that Solomon Islands is safe, law is enforced and those that break the law are dealt with accordingly. During the panel discussion, Philip also alleged that Australian security forces had twice failed to prevent the burning of Honiara’s Chinatown, the first time under the auspices of the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. “(A) wave of violence that happened here in Solomon Islands happened during 2006 election … when RAMSI was still here, very much in full presence and also RSIPF and Chinatown and some of our hotels were burnt down.” “The latest (wave) in November was the same, we have the presence of Australian police and maybe army personnel were here and still we have Chinatown burnt down.” In fact Australian police and troops which were mobilised within 24 hours of Solomon Islands government’s request made on the evening of the first day of the riots, only arrived in the country the day after Chinatown was burned down. “Australia was not responsible for the damage done to Chinatown. Australian forces helped to restore law and order in the city at a critical time,” the high commissioner said.",News/World news,Australia rejects claim its security forces in Solomon Islands were told not to protect Chinese-built buildings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/australia-rejects-claim-its-security-forces-in-solomon-islands-were-told-not-to-protect-chinese-built-buildings
4/21/2022,"The strength of Sandown’s Classic Trial has varied wildly over the years but the 2021 renewal turned out to be, well, a classic, with Adayar, the subsequent Derby and King George winner, finishing half a length behind Alenquer while Yibir, the Breeders’ Cup Turf winner in November, was a neck away in third. The race will be knocking on the door of Group Two status if the first four home this year turn out to be as good as the class of 21, and there is certainly a wealth of potential in the seven-runner field. Charlie Appleby’s Goldspur is top on the ratings and the likely favourite having run third in a Group One at St Cloud in October but the potential improvers include River Thames, from the Aidan O’Brien stable, and David Simcock’s Cash (3.35). Cash fell out of the stalls on his only start at two, in a one-mile maiden at Newmarket, but showed an excellent turn of foot to make up several lengths in the final two furlongs and win with something to spare. His pedigree suggests 10 furlongs could be a minimum this season and he looks like the pick of the prices at around 7-1. Sandown Park 1.20 Auditor has as much potential for progress as anything in the field after a convincing four-length win at Windsor on his final start at two. The time of that race was strong and an opening mark of 89 could be lenient. Sandown Park 1.50 A warm renewal of the Esher Cup, with Wanees perhaps the pick of the lightly raced three-year-olds. He made rapid progress over three races in a seven-week period at two, should improve for the step up to a mile and starts his handicapping career on a fair mark. Perth 2.05 Platinumcard made short work of six rivals on his handicap debut at Ayr earlier this month and a repeat performance from a 7lb higher mark looks likely. Sandown Park 2.25 Just three runners to run for a £45,000 first prize, and the lack of an obvious pacemaker could see it turn into a tactical affair too.

4/21/2022,"The big and loaded question: can the manager actually wield enough influence over the beast that is Manchester United to do it his way? This is a chicken-egg conundrum because winning games and trophies convinces players and the executive but conviction is required from players and the executive for the manager to have his decisions backed and to be a winning No 1. Then there is the club’s particular byzantine brew of politics and peccadilloes. At United Richard Arnold is the chief executive but the real finger on the button is across the Atlantic. And there are six: one for each of the Glazer siblings who own United and reside in Florida. Joel Glazer may be the day-to-day, hands-on chief of the owners but any major decision has to be okayed, too, by Avram, Darcie, Kevin, Bryan and Edward, who are also directors. This vote-by-committee via a five-hour, stateside time lag is hardly slick and streamlined, particularly when the depth of the owners’ collective football knowledge is unclear. Then there is Erik ten Hag’s main point of contact: John Murtough, the football director, who is a year into his role. Can Murtough be the Txiki Begiristain (Manchester City’s seriously astute sporting director) to the Dutchman’s (hopeful) Pep Guardiola? At 37 years old there is no way the Portuguese can remain an automatic choice if Ten Hag is going to build an actual team. The question is whether Ronaldo can be let go – not whether he should. A £490,000-a-week salary means there may be zero takers but if a loan can be struck – Paris Saint-Germain, if Kylian Mbappé goes to Real Madrid, maybe? – the Ronaldo problem may be solved. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s major error was to agree to the forward’s signing: the money siphoned off for a two-year contract – about £50m – could have been invested elsewhere and a squad that was supposed to be young, progressive and fleet-footed would not have been hampered by a footballer who is no longer any of these and is not conducive to long-term success. Rise and riseErik ten Hag, 52, spent much of hisplaying career as a central defenderat FC Twente – it is said a lack ofspeed made him work harder,position himself smarter and bemore aware of the importanceof teamwork, seeing the gamethrough a coach’s eyes while stillplaying. He moved seamlessly intoyouth coach roles at the club beforebecoming first-team assistant,which included a spell workingunder Steve McClaren before FredRutten took him to PSV Eindhovenin 2009 for three seasons.  The first-team coachMarc Overmars appointed himmanager of Go Ahead Eagles in2012 and he duly took the sideinto the Dutch top flight beforeleaving to coach Bayern Munich’ssecond team for two years. Thenit was back to the Netherlandswith Utrecht, drastically reformingthe club that finished 11th in theEredivisie the season before hisarrival and recorded fifth- andfourth-place finishes before Ajaxcame for him in 2017. In the 2018-19Champions League Real Madridand Juventus were beaten and onlyTottenham blocked Ajax’s pathto the final in the last second. Inthe Eredivisie he is seeking a thirdleague title in four seasons.  The style“That head is always full offootball,” says his childhood friendLeon ten Voorde. Reputation asa control freak who is loyal to hisplayers. Analyses opponents evenif he already played against themtwice in the season. Sends playersvideo clips of opponents and givespointers about which newspapersthey should read or what time theyshould be in bed. If Bruno Fernandes feels the need to blaze around Goodison Park to try to jump-start the side – as he did in the dire 1-0 loss to Everton – the team are no team. As alarming, too, is how Fernandes was waved on to do this: Ralf Rangnick made no move to stop the Portuguese and it was not the first time under the interim manager. This shows up United’s lack of structure, shape, plan, ethos and identity. Rangnick arrived on a “godfather of pressing” ticket and close to none of the strategy has been seen. City and Liverpool are so successful because Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp know precisely how they want their side to operate and have had time to execute this. Solskjær was given close to three years but never truly moved beyond a one-dimensional, counterattacking mode – a contributing factor to his sacking. Ten Hag’s Ajax had a defined way of playing – pass and move plus pressing. So, surely, the Dutchman will apply this. Put another way: the 52-year-old has to. Two centre-backs, two problems. Harry Maguire is not as poor as some portrayals but is not good enough to warrant his undroppable status. Raphaël Varane maybe deserves more time to prove he belongs in a different file to the captain. The Frenchman arrived last summer and a thought was that the World Cup winner might help improve Maguire, who most impresses in a back three for England. Ten Hag operates a 4-3-3: bad news for Maguire, who is slow and whose touch and decision-making under fire are suspect. Varane has also been sluggish, lacks desire and can be barged aside. Time for a reboot for the 28-year-old this summer then: work hard on physicality and game-reading and try to increase sprint speed. But whether Varane can become the defender of (former) repute is unclear. Real Madrid did, after all, allow his sale. The reason for this may already have been seen. As perennial as United’s lack of titles and farcical manager recruitment (the post-Sir Alex Ferguson score: permanent appointments 5, interims 4) is a dysfunctional transfer policy with top billing going to how no one at the club can seem to identify and sign a star schemer. This means a footballer who runs a match à la Kevin De Bruyne or Declan Rice. Or stop the opposition and ignite attacks – think Fernandinho or N’Golo Kanté. Can the new man pull off a trick that really should not be that hard? Two midfielders on this plane would be great, one a certifiable boon. City have De Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, Rodri, Fernandinho, Ilkay Gündogan and Phil Foden: a raft of A-listers. United have two B-acts in Scott McTominay and Fred, the veteran Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba, who will surely leave and has not been value for a £93.2m British record transfer fee. Also, Ten Hag needs a No 9. Ronaldo is shot, Edinson Cavani will leave, Mason Greenwood is currently suspended and Marcus Rashford is enduring a lost season. Acquiring a prolific centre-forward is of the same order as Ten Hag’s midfielder search: one of the copious rabbits he has to pull from the hat to make United a contender again.

4/21/2022,"When our children were small, the grindingly matey tones of Chris Tarrant could make me salivate. It was a classic Pavlovian response, because Tarrant ate dinner with us most evenings. Or to be more exact, we ate dinner with him. These, you see, were the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? years, when the show was reliably stripped throughout the early evening. And it turned out to be the perfect TV to eat your dinner in front of. The fact is, like so many young parents, we found the business of loving our babies utterly exhausting. Yes, a joy and an honour, but bloody hell, the little sods didn’t half take it out of us. Certainly, at the end of a long day’s vigorous 21st-century parenting, the last thing we wanted was one of those civilised catch-up dinners at the kitchen table that the relationship therapists recommend. No, we wanted to eat wordlessly in front of the telly, lubricated by a bucket each of sauvignon blanc. Both Millionaire and Tarrant were just the thing. You didn’t need to watch to know what was going on. Every time you looked up, all the important information would be there on the screen. You could focus instead on shovelling stuff into your face, while merely listening to Tarrant commiserate with some numbnuts who’d just lost £125,000 because they thought Hitler’s first name was Heil. Thank God those young parenting years are far behind us, for we live now in different times; in the age of the narratively complex TV box-set drama. And have you ever attempted to eat in front of one of those? It’s a nightmare. By far the worst are those intricate Scandi dramas like Borgen or The Bridge, in which improbably beautiful but icy protagonists glide through the emotional chaos bringing order, while also managing subtly to extoll the virtues of northern European models of social democracy through the mere twitch of an eye. Trying to eat your soup without spilling it down yourself and at the same time keeping up with the subtitles is simply impossible. The only thing less appropriate is a subtitled South Korean gore-fest like Squid Game or All of Us Are Dead. A rule of thumb: when eating in front of the telly, the bleeding pieces of meat should mostly be on your plate, not the screen. But even an English language drama can be problematic. They are so well written these days, so detailed and brilliantly acted that one distracting mouthful of shepherd’s pie during an episode of, say, Mare of Easttown can leave you floundering because you missed one of Kate Winslet’s slight but significant facial expressions, upon which the whole plot will now turn. There are box sets which work with a TV dinner. You can eat anything you like in front of an episode of Reacher, for example, because the drama is built on an emotional register that runs the gamut from, ooh, A to B. Otherwise, if you are intent on eating like this, there’s only one place for you: Dave. The self-styled home of witty banter is specifically engineered with a bowl of chips and a bucket of chicken wings in mind. Look down at your food. Get lost in the textural delights of that deep fried battered something. It really doesn’t matter. You won’t miss a thing. A bunch of standup comedians who can’t quite believe their luck will still be flinging creaky bons mots at each other, like jokes are a contact sport. And once you’ve emptied your plate, once you’ve cleared everything away, you can finally change the channel. Dinner is done. Now you can pay attention.",Lifestyle/Food,"Millionaire, Reacher, The Bridge … some shows are more suited to TV dinners than others",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/21/millionaire-reacher-the-bridge-some-shows-are-more-suited-to-tv-dinners-than-others
4/21/2022,"Fontaines DC have been a lot of different things over the course of their brief career. Gobby upstarts, loudly proclaiming their own greatness – “my childhood was small, but I’m gonna be big,” crowed Grian Chatten on the opening track of the band’s 2019 debut – and surly self-doubters, prickly distrustful of their own success and acclaim: “Pigeonholed, coo’ed to death,” complained Chatten on its 2020 successor A Hero’s Death. The sound of young Dublin, decrying the limitations of their home city – “if you’re a rock star, pornstar, superstar – doesn’t matter what you are / get a good car, get out of here” – and Irish emigres uneasily relocated to Britain: “London’s fine, did my time / threshed the truth out the lie.” A band who felt like a reset button on an increasingly moribund alt-rock scene, barging to the head of a fresh wave of artists with noisy guitars and sprechgesang vocals, and refuseniks, declining to be part of anything: “I don’t belong to anyone, I don’t want to belong to anyone.” Given their history, the question of what Fontaines DC are now lurks around their third album. It comes wrapped in a sleeve featuring a nervous-looking deer in the hallway of a home, its title derives from a Gaelic expression of exasperation, and it variously picks at topics of addiction, relationships and the notion of Irishness as viewed through the lens of the Irish diaspora. If its predecessor was an album audibly written by a tour-weary band wary of the hyperventilating reviews and Mercury prize nominations – home to songs with names such as Televised Mind, A Lucid Dream and No – its great skill lay in turning said wariness into songs that felt gripping and realistic, not petulant. By contrast, Skinty Fia feels more measured and reflective. It boasts few examples of their punky full-pelt approach. Its default rhythmic setting is slow; its guitars feel echoey and cavernous – even shoegaze-y on churning closer Nabokov – rather than urgent and in your face. One song strips away every recognisable aspect of Fontaines DC’s sound save for Chatten’s vocals – and sets them to a wheezing accordion: The Couple Across the Way is a refugee from an abandoned idea to record a double album, with one half devoted to songs inspired by traditional Irish music. Its lyrics depict a bickering old couple spotting new neighbours (“a pair with passion in its prime”) and wondering aloud what they make of them. “Maybe they look through to us and hope that’s them in time,” it concludes, ambiguously. It’s hard to work out whether that final line suggests that, deep down and despite the arguments, everything between the older couple is fine, or whether it’s a hollow laugh at the delusions of young love. Emotionally at least, The Couple Across the Way is of a part with the rest of Skinty Fia: an uneasy uncertainty, or at least equivocation, seeps into almost everything. Roman Holiday is both dizzy with the excitement of life in London – “come on before the going gets gone … get your high heels on” – and furious at English snobbery: “While they’re snuffing out hopes and blotting out suns / they claim to know the form in which genius comes.” Bloomsday finds Chatten walking around Dublin, his nostalgia punctured by the realisation of why he left in the first place: “Looking for a thing no do-er’s done / We won’t find it here my love.” Crawling along, strafed with atonal shards of guitar, the music tells its own story. Meanwhile, the album’s poppiest moment, the Smiths-y single Jackie Down the Line, has something approaching a singalong chorus and comes decorated with “do-do-do” and “la-la-la” refrains that conceal a grim story of a controlling, abusive relationship told from the unrepentant perspective of the abuser: an impressively unsettling thing to get audiences to sing along with. In a polarised era, there’s something cheering about Fontaines DC’s bold refusal to join in, to deal instead in shades of grey and equivocation. There’s also something bold about their disinclination to rely on the most immediate aspect of their sound. If you do occasionally long for a track that grabs the listener by the throat in the way Boys in the Better Land or A Hero’s Death did, the music compensates by expanding in a way that bodes well for the future: the title track’s combination of jagged guitars and electronics, which at points recalls an overcast version of the Chemical Brothers’ sound; the tapestry of almost choral backing vocals behind opener In ár gCroíthe Go Deo. For now, embracing a state of confusion suits them.

4/21/2022,"Downing Street has dramatically pulled an amendment aimed at forcing Tory MPs to delay an inquiry into whether Boris Johnson misled parliament – which will now allow MPs to vote to investigate the prime minister. Amid growing anger from Conservative MPs, the Commons leader, Mark Spencer, said that MPs would be given a free vote on a motion to refer Johnson to the Commons privileges committee – which has the power to demand documents and photographs of lockdown breaches. With minutes to go before a vote that would have delayed any inquiry, Spencer told MPs: “The prime minister has indicated that he is keen for the house to decide on the business later today. The vote on the unamended house business will be a free vote to all Conservative MPs.” Chris Pincher, the government’s chief whip, texted Tory MPs telling them that Johnson was “happy for the Commons to decide on any referrals to the privilege committee”. He added the government would “no longer move our tabled amendment”. Pincher added: “The vote on the unamended house business motion will be a free vote for all Conservative MPs. Accordingly we are now on a one-line whip.” On Wednesday night, as Tory whips scrambled to find a way to block or delay the inquiry by the privileges committee, even among frontbenchers there was palpable disquiet that MPs should be forced to block an investigation into the prime minister, who received a police fixed-penalty notice last week. Earlier in the Commons, the Tory MP Charles Walker had urged the government to reconsider whipping MPs to delay the inquiry. “Can we please try and find a way today not to have a fractious debate and a division?” he said. “I believe genuinely that the prime minister is a good and decent man and he can make the case to the privileges committee directly without having this house to divide and yet more poison be pumped into public life.” A senior government source said Johnson had instructed whips to pull the amendment after becoming concerned about accusations of a cover-up. “The prime minister has always been clear that he’s happy to face whatever inquiries parliament sees fit and is happy for the house to decide how it wishes to proceed today and therefore will not be whipping Conservative MPs,” he said. “They are free to vote according to how they believe we should move forward on this.” The source said the amendment on Wednesday had been tabled to allow the process to take place after the internal Whitehall report by the civil servant Sue Gray was published – although it made no specific commitments that the parliamentary inquiry would still be allowed. “We now recognise that – in practice – this is almost certainly likely to be the case and therefore we are happy for the Labour motion to go through if that is the will of the house,” the source said. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, called the U-turn humiliating. She said that No 10 “knew they couldn’t win this” because Johnson was “bang to rights” so was forced to capitulate. Rayner added: “Tory MPs should do the right thing, respect the sacrifices that their constituents made during the pandemic, and vote in the national interest.”",News/Politics,No 10 will not force Tory MPs to delay inquiry into whether PM misled Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/21/no-10-drops-attempt-to-delay-inquiry-into-whether-boris-johnson-misled-parliament
4/21/2022,"Chris Garrett recalled his last conversation with the British fighter Aiden Aslin. Aslin was holed up in Mariupol and surrounded by Russian forces. He had run out of food and ammunition. It seemed unlikely he would get out of the city alive. “We spoke on the phone. Aiden told me: ‘I think we are going to have to surrender,’” Garrett said. Two days later, Aslin and his fellow British fighter Shaun Pinner negotiated with a Russian commander. They emerged from the ghostly shattered ruins of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where Ukrainian fighters continue to hold out in underground tunnels. Both are now prisoners of war in Donetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city run by pro-Moscow separatists since 2014. The pair are also at the centre of a political row. Downing Street has suggested they should not have been in Mariupol in the first place. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said had had sympathy with the captured Britons but said they were fighting in Ukraine “illegally”. He would not comment on government efforts to get them back. Garrett – a British fighter working as a sapper in Ukraine – said Lewis’s remarks were “completely false”. The pair had signed a legal long-term contract several years ago with Ukraine’s ministry of defence and were not in the same category as foreign legion volunteers, who arrived in Ukraine after Russia’s invasion, he said. “They have homes and partners here. Shaun has a Ukrainian wife,” he said. “They are very nice guys,” Garrett added, speaking in a cafe in Kyiv, just off the capital’s main Khreschatyk boulevard. “They have gone through absolute hell. There is no way to comprehend what they have been through. Shaun was injured by shrapnel. Nobody really expected them to get out. If they’d surrendered to Chechens they would be dead.” Garrett’s own connection with Ukraine goes back to 2014. A former soldier from the Isle of Man, he visited Kyiv in the aftermath of its pro-European Maidan revolution. He subsequently joined a Ukrainian brigade, clearing mines and unexploded ordnance. He left in 2017 and came back four days after Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked February attack. Both of his friends have given interviews to Russian state media. Garrett said it was clear they had spoken under duress and were being exploited by Moscow for propaganda purposes. The British propagandist Graham Phillips, who has worked for the Kremlin RT channel, described Aslin as a “mercenary”. “I watched the video yesterday. I don’t think it’s right. It’s against the Geneva conventions [to show footage of them],” Garrett said. When asked, prisoners of war are obliged to give their real name and rank. They cannot be compelled to give more information, the conventions say. Russia’s foreign ministry claimed on Thursday the two were being “fed, watered, and given the necessary assistance”. Aslin was serving as a marine in Ukraine’s 36th brigade. He appeared on Russian TV, however, wearing a T-shirt with the logo of the far-right Azov battalion. Putin says his “special operation” in Ukraine is needed to “denazify” the country. “The T-shirt looks brand new. It would not have been Aiden’s. The Russians probably picked it up when they took the Azov base in Mariupol,” Garrett said. Garrett has worked with the Azov battalion, but he has said he is not rightwing or a Nazi sympathiser. He has himself been the target of smears by Russian state media. In January 2015 he was stationed in Mariupol when it came under indiscriminate rocket attack from separatist-held territory. He saw a dead young woman half blown into a shop window. “I covered her head with a bright pink frock,” he said. A TV crew ambushed him minutes later and he was accused by RT of being an American spy. The Kremlin appears to be hinting it might be prepared to swap the two British prisoners for Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent pro-Moscow Ukrainian politician. Medvedchuk was arrested last week while trying to flee Ukraine. Aslin mentioned a possible exchange with Medvedchuk in his interview. “They are feeding him lines to say,” Garrett said, adding that his friends were “mentally strong guys”. Garrett, 38, was scathing about some of the western volunteers who have arrived in Ukraine, eager to shoot Russians. They include ex-military personnel from the US, UK, Canada and other countries: “Some are useful. But many tell tall tales.” He said former soldiers should not volunteer unless they had specific skills, such as training in the use of anti-aircraft and anti-armour weapons. Few foreign soldiers, he added, had experience of what was taking place in Donbas, the new focus for Russia’s military operation and advance. He said the fighting was characterised by heavy bombardment, artillery and relentless mortar fire. “We are seeing the biggest trench warfare since world war two,” he said, adding that both sides were taking losses. Garrett is now heading east. He admitted he wasn’t looking forward to going back to the frontline. His own skills in defusing sub-munitions and removing tripwires were likely to be needed for years to come, he said. The Russian army had left booby traps and munitions across the Kyiv region, during a month-long occupation, with Donbas and other areas also extensively mined. His prognosis for Mariupol was bleak. On Thursday Putin declared victory in the port city on the sea of Azov and said Russian forces would not try to storm the Azovstal factory. Instead they would blockade it to ensure nobody got out. About 1,000 civilians, including woman and children, are trapped inside. Attempts by the Kyiv government to evacuate them have failed. What would happen to the Ukrainian fighters still in Mariupol’s steelworks? “They will all die, I’m afraid,” he said. “They know that if they surrender they will be killed. The factory is designed to withstand a nuclear strike. It’s a huge facility built on multiple levels. But sooner or later they will run out of food. Their head-torches will stop working.” He added: “If it were me I would rather die in an airstrike than starve to death in a dark basement.”",News/World news,‘They’ve gone through hell’: fears for British prisoners of war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/aiden-aslin-shaun-pinner-fears-for-british-prisoners-of-war-in-ukraine
4/21/2022,"The office of Germany’s chancellor crossed several heavy weapons off a wishlist of military hardware it has offered to purchase from its armaments industry on behalf of the Ukrainian government, according to a report in German media that casts doubt over Olaf Scholz’s claim to have agreed the procurement process with Kyiv. At a press conference on Tuesday evening, Scholz said he had asked arms contractors to come up with a list of weapons systems it could swiftly deliver to boost Ukraine’s defensive effort after Germany’s military had exhausted its own stocks. “Ukraine has now made a selection from this list and we will provide it with the required money for the purchase”, Scholz said. According to a report in Thursday’s edition of newspaper Bild, the industry’s offer in mid-March still included several heavy weapons Kyiv says it will need to withstand Russia’s offensive in the country’s east, including armoured “Boxer” transport vehicles, the Panzerhaubitze (PzH) 2000 artillery system, and the Leopard 2 battle tank manufactured by Munich-based defence company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann. By the time the list, headed “Support options industry – consolidated”, was submitted to the Ukrainian government at the end of March, Bild said it had shrunk from 48 to 24 pages and only included three of 15 types of arms requested by Kyiv. Two follow-up requests by the Ukrainian government on 9 and 16 April were reportedly ignored by the German side. The report is likely to add further fuel to a diplomatic row in which Scholz’s coalition government says it is doing everything within its means to help Ukraine withstand Russia’s assault, while Ukrainian diplomats accuse Berlin of stalling on arms shipments out of fear of provoking Putin into escalating the war. The list of industry products that Germany says it will pay for does include some modern machinery such as radar systems, remote-controlled weapons stations that can be mounted on Ukrainian tanks, and armoured transport vehicles. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, on Wednesday said cryptically that her government had in the past chosen not to make all of its weapons exports to Ukraine public. “We have delivered anti-tank missiles, Stingers and other things that we have never spoken about publicly, so these deliveries could happen quickly,” she said. Citing anonymous government sources, Bloomberg reported that Germany would provide Ukrainian troops with training and ammunition for the PzH 2000, a self-propelled, rapid-fire artillery system, which the Netherlands is sending to Ukraine. Scholz had not mentioned the arrangement with the Netherlands in his speech on Tuesday.",News/World news,German report casts doubt on scale of its weapons support for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/german-report-casts-doubt-on-scale-of-its-weapons-support-for-ukraine
4/21/2022,"Robert Morse, who starred in the hit US drama Mad Men, has died at the age of 90. His most well known role was as Bert Cooper, the head of the show’s advertising agency, who gave his surname to the company Sterling Cooper. In a career spanning nearly 60 years, he appeared in about 100 theatre, TV and film productions, having first made his name in 1961 in a stage adaptation of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, based on Shepherd Mead’s best-selling book – for which he won the Tony award for best actor in a musical. It was a feat he would follow up in 1990, winning the Tony for best featured actor in a play, for his turn as Truman Capote in the play Tru. It not only made him one of only four actors to ever win the top acting Tonys for play and musical, but also earned him an Emmy award three years later when a live performance of the show was broadcast on TV. His role as the eccentric founder of Mad Men’s ad agency shot him to international fame, earning him nominations for five Emmy awards, and a Screen Actor’s Guild award win, as part of the ensemble cast. His final episode saw him drawing on his Broadway skills for a big musical number following his death, as he performed a song-and-dance routine to The Best Things in Life Are Free, having peacefully died during Neil Armstrong’s 1969 moon landing. “My good pal Bobby Morse has passed away at age 90,” tweeted Larry Karaszewski, the writer/producer and VP on the board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. “A huge talent and a beautiful spirit.
