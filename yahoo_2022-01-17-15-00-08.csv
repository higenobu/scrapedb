1/17/2022,"Subaru is still new to EVs, but that isn't stopping it from unveiling more ambitious projects. Electrek reports the automaker has introduced two concept EVs at the Tokyo Auto Salon, including its first all-electric race car. The STI E-RA Concept hints at Subaru's upcoming track vehicle with 1,073HP of total power from its four Yamaha motors, extensive downforce and all-wheel drive mated to a ""unique"" torque vectoring system that maximizes grip and stability. While the 60kWh battery is relatively small, Subaru is confident the E-RA can thrive on the track. It's hoping to set a Nürburgring lap time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds at some point in 2023. That's not as quick as VW's ID.R (6 minutes 5 seconds), but it's comfortably ahead of road cars like Tesla's Model S Plaid (7 minutes 35 seconds). The company plans to test the E-RA at Japanese racing circuits later in 2022. The brand also unveiled a Solterra STI Concept (at middle) that, as the name implies, is a sportier version of the upcoming crossover. Subaru didn't discuss under-body changes, but the upgraded Solterra has a roof spoiler, skirt spoilers and other customizations to signal its performance ambitions. However much the E-RA represents Subaru's motorsport plans, it's also serving as a declaration of intent. Like VW's racer, it shows the company is serious about EVs and can produce high-performance cars in addition to everyday people haulers. The challenge is to translate lessons learned from concepts like this to regular vehicles. Subaru is late to EVs compared even to incumbents like VW, Mercedes and GM, and it may need to move quickly if it wants to counter the electrification efforts of its rivals.",Business/Engadget,"Subaru unveils a 1,073HP electric race car",https://news.yahoo.com/subaru-sti-e-ra-concept-electric-race-car-213630682.html

1/17/2022,"By Karen Lema MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' election commission on Monday threw out a petition seeking to bar the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos from running in this year's election, one of several complaints filed in an attempt to derail his presidential bid. The petition had sought to invalidate the candidacy of Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who has emerged as a clear favourite, after accusing him of misrepresenting his eligibility because of a prior tax conviction. But the second division of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) dismissed the complaint, lawyers in the petition said. ""The Second Division ruled that there was no grounds to cancel Marcos Jr's COC (certificate of candidacy) on the grounds of material representation,"" the lawyers said in a statement. The lawyers said they will file a motion for reconsideration with COMELEC with a full bench of judges. The complaint is among several filed by groups seeking the expulsion of Marcos, a career politician who has served as congressman, senator and a provincial governor, mostly over a 1995 conviction for tax violations while in public office, which petitioners had argued meant a lifetime election ban. The other petitions are pending with COMELEC's first division. ""We thank the Commission on Elections for upholding the law and the right of every bona fide candidate like Bongbong Marcos to run for public office free from any form of harassment and discrimination,"" Marcos's spokesman, Vic Rodriguez said in a statement, referring to the candidate's nickname. The election to choose a successor to Rodrigo Duterte, who is barred by the constitution from a second term, takes place on May 9. Other top candidates include senator and retired boxing champion Manny Pacquiao https://reut.rs/3EYCDzw, Manila mayor Francisco Domagoso https://reut.rs/3FgtdzN, Vice President Leni Robredo https://reut.rs/324n4aw and Senator Panfilo Lacson, a former police chief.
