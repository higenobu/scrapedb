1/13/2022,"A married same-sex couple have become the first in Taiwan to legally adopt a child neither of them are related to, after they challenged local laws in court. Wang Chen-wei, Chen Chun-ju, and their daughter, nicknamed Joujou, were surrounded by press at the Taipei household registration office, as the couple formally signed adoption paperwork after a long battle. Clutching Joujou, her face hidden behind a hoodie, face mask and sunglasses, Wang and Chen told of their bittersweet victory.  “I have everything now. I am married and just like heterosexual couples, we can have our own children,” Wang said. “But we were born to have and enjoy all of this, we are not a charity case. We shouldn’t have had to fight for it.” Taiwan legalised same-sex marriage in 2019, becoming the first jurisdiction in Asia to do so, but did not remove all inequalities for LGBTQI people. Full legislation rather than an amendment was passed. It includes a provision that allows someone to adopt a spouse’s biological child, but says nothing about adoption rights if neither partner is the biological parent. The provision does not exist in other marriage laws. The result is that in Taiwan any single person can apply to adopt a child, and any married heterosexual couple can apply together. But for married same-sex couple, the only option is to divorce and one of the couple adopts as a single person. They can then remarry, but current law does not allow the partner to adopt and be registered as a parent, leaving them without equal rights. “Gay adoptive families are forced to choose between children and spouses, and between adoption and marriage,” Chen and Wang wrote on Facebook shortly after signing the adoption papers. Wang and Chen have been together for more than 16 years, and embarked on the adoption journey together. They delayed their marriage in order to complete Wang’s adoption of Joujou, and then took the case to court to have Chen recognised as a parent. On 25 December, the Kaohsiung juvenile and family court ruled that a child should not be discriminated against because of their parents status, and that the law did not expressly prohibit the adoption of adopted children. The ruling allowed Chen to adopt Joujou and be registered as a parent alongside Wang. Chu Chiajong, the director of advocacy organisation Taiwan LGBT Family Rights Advocacy, said the ruling was “brave”, in that the judge found his legal obligation was governed by the child’s best interest, and upon assessing Wang and Chen’s case, it meant the two parents were seen as equal under the law. “At the end of the day, someone finally acknowledged it’s all about a child’s best interests, not just about the rights of an LGBTI couple,” Chu said. “Now their daughter’s ID shows both parents name on it. It means she finally is legally under the protection of both parents, of both dads.” While the case has brought hope to LGBTQI couples hoping to start a family, it did not set a precedent and legal change is still needed, said Chu. But the solution is simple, Chu added: “We just need to fix one word in the same-sex marriage law, just the word ‘genetic’. If we get rid of that word it would allow LGBTQI couples to adopt.” A bill proposed by the legislator Fan Yun has been stalled in Taiwan’s parliament for more than a year. “We are waiting for the submission … from the Ministry of Justice,” Fan told media on Thursday. Wang and Chen have always wanted two children but that is off limits until the law changes. Now they are married they cannot adopt, and if they divorced they would still have to go to court again to fight for dual adoption. “I hope that our first story of victory as a gay couple will serve as a foundation for the full practice of fair, equal treatment for other LGBT families,” said Chen.

1/13/2022,"Amid the jaw-dropping stories of horrific abuse in Ronnie Spector’s 1990 autobiography Be My Baby, there’s a fascinating passage about her singing voice. She says she felt cowed by the other female singers in Phil Spector’s stable of stars: she didn’t have the kind of big, gospel-trained voice that Darlene Love or Fanita James possessed. But the producer had singled her out for special treatment. Veronica Bennett, as she was then, had “exactly what he needed to fill the centre of this enormous sound”, she said. Phil Spector was famous for rounding up whoever was in the studio to sing backing vocals, but he demurred when Ronnie offered. You could see that as an early example of the controlling behaviour with which he made her life a misery after their marriage, but his explanation was pretty convincing: “Your voice is too distinctive – it comes right though.” He was right. Phil Spector worked with a succession of fantastic singers – not just Love and James, but the Righteous Brothers, Tina Turner and LaLa Brooks of the Crystals – but none of them sounded like Ronnie, a state of affairs that makes a mockery of the notion that Phil Spector was the solitary artist at work on his records, his vocalists interchangeable puppets.  There’s something immediately recognisable about her voice, a combination of street toughness and tenderness, a trademark vibrato, a raw, unschooled power. It didn’t matter how dense and unyielding Phil Spector’s arrangements got, Ronnie Spector’s voice always cut through. Even Tina Turner sounds like she’s fighting for space with the umpteen instruments on River Deep Mountain High, but listen to the Ronettes’ Is This What I Get for Loving You? or I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine – singles that exist in the shade of their biggest hits Be My Baby and Baby, I Love You – recorded in 1965 and 1966, by which point Spector’s production style had become increasingly OTT. Even when I Wish I Never Saw the Sunshine reaches its emotional height – the moment just before the chorus when the drums crash in – you, metaphorically speaking, can’t take your eyes off Ronnie Spector. Everything else is (an admittedly elaborate) background to her wracked cries of “oh baby!” It made it all the more unfair that she struggled to establish herself outside the context of Philles Records and her appalling husband. When Phil Spector decided to pull up the drawbridge and withdraw from making records, Ronnie Spector had to go with him: the barbed wire on top of the walls, the guard dogs and the threats to kill her and display her body in a glass coffin if she tried to leave saw to that. When he re-emerged, towards the end of their marriage, as George Harrison and John Lennon’s producer of choice, she re-emerged too, but luck wasn’t on her side. She cut a fabulous, mandolin-bedecked version of the former’s Try Some, Buy Some for Apple records, but it flopped: perhaps the melody was too cyclical and hypnotic for pop radio, perhaps the lyrics – which contrasted drug use with spiritual awakening – were too oblique. There was supposed to be an album, with a crack backing band involving Harrison, Leon Russell and various members of Eric Clapton’s Derek and the Dominos, but like a lot of things that were supposed to happen at Apple, it never materialised. By all accounts, the sessions were torture for Ronnie Spector, who sat silently in the vocal booth waiting for her cue while her husband ignored her in favour of chatting to Harrison: according to engineer Ken Scott, she was visibly too terrified to speak up. In the end, Harrison simply took the backing track of Try Some, Buy Some and recorded his own vocal over it for his 1973 album Living in the Material World: if you want to hear how good Ronnie Spector’s performance of the song is, it’s worth contrasting the two versions. Finally divorced, she formed a new version of the Ronettes, but to little avail: it didn’t help that the best song they recorded, the funky Go Out and Get It, ended up as a B-side. She made a great disco single, You’d Be Good For Me, before working with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. It was an arrangement that suited both parties perfectly. The influence of Phil Spector’s 60s singles on the E Street Band’s sound was obvious; furthermore they were at a loose end, broke and trapped in recording limbo by Springsteen’s legal struggle with an ex-manager. The resulting single, a cover of Billy Joel’s Say Goodbye to Hollywood, was stunning, its commercial failure baffling, although Steve Van Zandt later suggested the money the musicians made stopped the E Street Band from breaking up entirely. Next, she was embraced by New York’s punk scene, making a new wave-ish solo album, Siren, with members of the Dead Boys and the Heartbreakers. If nothing else, the sheer diversity of musicians she worked with post-divorce told you both something about how widely revered she was, and something about her voice, which managed to be both incredibly adaptable – it fitted over the strings and dancefloor rhythms of You’d Be Good to Me just as well as it did over a cover of the Ramones’ Here Today, Gone Tomorrow – and utterly unique: it didn’t matter whether she was singing soul or punk, you always knew immediately that you were listening to Ronnie Spector. Both facts were underlined when she finally scored a hit in 1986, albeit in a supporting role. Eddie Money’s Take Me Home Tonight was shiny, be-mulleted stadium AOR, entirely of its era. When she appears midway through, singing the refrain from Be My Baby, the contrast between the grit in her voice and the gloss that surrounds her is really striking. Without wishing to sound sniffy – Take Me Home Tonight is a perfectly good example of a certain strain of 80s rock, which has its own charm – it’s the difference between soulful emotion and an over-inflated, chest-beating simulacrum of emotion. Its MTV-fuelled success – along with her autobiography, and an eventually successful court process against her ex-husband that saw the Ronettes awarded back royalties – helped set Ronnie Spector up for the rest of her career. She never had a hit in her own right, but she toured relentlessly and started playing Christmas shows in New York that became a staple part of the city’s musical calendar. As before, the range of musicians who queued up to work with her told its own story: she could go from performing with Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs to Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin producer Narada Michael Walden to Keith Richards to horror punk pioneers Misfits without missing a beat. You only had to glance at Amy Winehouse to see Ronnie Spector’s influence: the beehive and the thick eyeliner were a dissolute take on her 60s look; the sound of the Ronettes was in Back to Black’s DNA. You’re never too far from a new single that knowingly sounds like Be My Baby or Baby, I Love You, and you probably never will be: they cast as long a shadow over pop as anything made in the 60s. The big difference is that, as ever, whoever’s singing them won’t sound like Ronnie Spector.",Arts/Music,No one else sounded like the tough yet tender Ronnie Spector,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/ronnie-spector-ronettes-singer-hits
1/13/2022,"The most significant goals Philippe Coutinho scored as a Barcelona player were against them, which pretty much sums it up. On loan at Bayern Munich, where he had his most successful season since leaving Liverpool for €160m, he got two in the 8-2 humiliation of the club that owned him then and despite all their efforts to the contrary still own him now. That night in August 2020 he raised a hand to apologise for what he had done. Seventeen months later, he has left again. As for what he has done, most supporters would say: nothing much. The only thing anyone in Catalonia regrets about Coutinho’s departure to Aston Villa this week is that it took too long. Actually, that’s not entirely true: they also regret that there will be no return, except his. At the end of the season, he will probably be back. At which point, they will try to get him to leave again. It was hard enough to bring him in; it proved equally hard to move him out. He has gone only on loan, Villa – who are at home to Manchester United on Saturday – paying 65% of his salary, but a least he has gone. The most expensive signing in Barcelona’s history may have been the worst.  All of which might sound unfair, even cruel. And it probably is: there has been something uncomfortable in watching the treatment of him at times, in that glimpse of vulnerability and rejection; in the feeling that while there is certainly culpability, circumstance, culture and context conspired against him; in watching the good moments slip from view, lost to some collective amnesia. Because there have been goals for Barcelona too: 26 of them plus 14 assists in 106 games is not a terrible return. He scored the opener in a clásico, setting Barcelona on course for a 5-1 demolition of Madrid. He scored in a Copa del Rey semi-final andprovided a goal and an assist in the final, helping them complete a double in his first season. He was not playing when they collapsed and were knocked out the Champions League in Rome, so that could hardly be held against him. Had he been there, who knows, maybe they would have won a treble. Which he did with Bayern. There was something about him scoring in Lisbon that expressed that the mess is not of his making. And yet those two Bayern goals may well be the most telling image of his time as a Barcelona player, precisely because they were symbolic of how damaging the whole thing has been: self-inflicted, literally and metaphorically an own goal. A portrait of the regime of the former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, a metaphor for the whole crisis and how they got into a situation like this. None of the goals Coutinho scored for Barcelona, forgotten too fast, leave an impression as lasting. Which may be unfair, but a sort of melancholy clings to his story, to him. This ending, which may not even be the end, expresses it. Barcelona were so desperate to sign Coutinho that having failed to get him in the summer of 2017 they came back again at Christmas, and for a combined cost with Ousmane Dembélé that the club’s finance director had said would be “irresponsible”, a sackable offence. Their most expensive player leaves for nothing, and even managing that ended up feeling like an achievement. Above all, it was a necessity. When Coutinho signed Barcelona made much of how he had made a “financial effort” to come, which is what clubs too often say and which proved ironic. Tied to a salary of about €15m a year after tax, for the past three years they have been as desperate to give him away, but the same salary that made moving him on so important, pushing him towards the door before other players equally deserving, also trapped him. Everyone knew that they had overspent when he arrived, which is rarely a good start, but the signing made sense. Xavi Hernández, his current manager, was among those who thought his style compatible with the Camp Nou. But if he said so then, from the outside, four years on, now inside, he doesn’t see entirely see it. The sporting director judged him the “ideal replacement” for Andrés Iniesta, which may have been part of the problem just as the price was. Iniesta’s position was not his, nor exactly was Neymar’s. The technical quality was there though, as was the physical capacity brought from England, at least for a while. So too was the welcome – Luis Suárez collected him from the airport – and the first six months were good, a point that at this juncture feels worth making in his defence: he got nine goals and eight assists in 20 games. Yet he could not play in Europe and when he arrived Barcelona were a long way clear in the league, their success not really seen as his. By the end it felt almost as if he wasn’t really there. He was hit by injury and, it seemed, insecurity. Ernesto Valverde had to find a place for him, which wasn’t easy. There was little point in someone else ‘being Messi’ when they had Messi. Messi and Suárez were relieved of some responsibility to press; accommodating another one wouldn’t work. Attempts to find another role were not always reciprocated. Instead of a determination to rebel against his fate, fight for that role, there was a hint of inhibition. Coutinho was well-liked and those who trained with him saw things – just not often on match days. The culture at the club did not help either. The second season started with four goals and an assist in the opening 10 league games, including that strike against Madrid, without Messi in the team. But there was just one of each in the next 26. Frustration grew among fans; whistles followed to which he was not impervious. When he scored against Manchester United in the Champions League quarter-final, he put his fingers in his ears, vulnerability revealed. Which of course made it worse. Suárez said, tellingly: “The smallest thing you do – tiny, like Philippe did – is made bigger. The manager said it: ‘I’m surprised you’re talking about the gesture and not the great goal he scored,’ a goal that would have given him confidence. Sometimes you have to understand him. If fans want a player to perform, support him, because a player out on the pitch isn’t stupid. He hears it when he loses a ball and there’s this ‘zzzzzhhhhhiiii’.” The following seasonCoutinho was in Munich, the first rejection but maybe a chance for a return when Bayern decided not to exercise their right to buy, itself a comment on confidence in him. Sales were sought but not found, so he was stuck. That said, if bound by circumstance, there was support back at Barcelona. Ronald Koeman, a new manager, called and said he wanted to play him in his position: as a No 10 behind Messi. There were two assists and a goal in the opening three league games. He scored in his first Champions League match too. And then there was … well, not much, Coutinho fading again. A meniscus injury meant he didn’t play a game after the turn of the year. He underwent three operations and spent nine months out. He was too expensive for this, for a club forced to lose the best player they have had. And, yes, Coutinho still being there while Messi wasn’t played its part in his public portrayal, however unjust that was. Again, they tried to move him on. Again, they failed. He talked about working to make people look upon him with “other eyes”. Messi’s depatrure offered opportunity too. Asked about Coutinho after an impressive display early this season, Koeman replied: “He’s a good footballer. It’s my job to get the best out of them and that starts with putting them in their position.” “I have always believed in Coutinho,” Koeman had insisted but others didn’t – and, it sometimes felt, that might have included Coutinho himself. When he scored against Valencia in October, his first goal in a year, he said he had a “scar that makes me stronger” and a “desire to be the best I can be”. But at Barcelona, he never really was. Ten days later, Koeman was gone. Now Coutinho has gone, for a second time. “Since I came back I never had a run of four or five starts in a row to be able to be at my best level,” he said. Now, he may get them, another chance to have an impact in someone else’s shirt.",Sport/Football,"Will Coutinho, the costly Barcelona misfit, show his worth at Aston Villa? | Sid Lowe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/13/will-coutinho-barcelona-misfit-show-worth-at-aston-villa
1/13/2022,"On a January night in the tiny Herefordshire village of Eardisland, a crowd of hundreds is being led to an orchard down a muddy country lane. Their leaders wear tall hats, garlanded with fruit, feathers and flowers; their faces are a damp, mossy, green; their ankles jingle with bells. It is very dark: the only light comes from a crisp, crescent moon and the flaming torches that men, women and children hold in their hands. The scene may sound sinister, but there is joy in the air at this crop-blessing wassail, a midwinter folklore ceremony, usually in apple-producing counties, involving singing, dancing and other folk customs. At Eardisland, the Leominster morris – they in the extravagant hats, plus flowery jackets made from old bedsheets and curtains – pour cider made from last year’s apples on to tree roots, hang toasted bread on tree branches to tempt the spirits, and light fires to represent renewal and the coming spring sun. The mood is jolly. “I’ll hopefully not set my leg on fire,” says the announcer, Josh Johnson, to laughter, before stamping flames out.  This wassail isn’t an oddity either, says Jon Wilks, musician and the founder/editor of Tradfolk, a new website that aims to bring together different iterations of traditional folk culture today. Wilks decided to put together a wassailing directory for 2022, assuming it would be a quick job. “I thought there’d be 15 or so wassails in the West Country. Nine hours and close to 50 entries later, I was still going.” (His tally currently sits at 61.) The list combines long-established groups and new starters, who came together via Instagram and TikTok – Wilks wonders whether the Wellerman craze of a year ago took people from sea shanties to wassails, and, of course, this is a relatively low-risk way to enjoy live music in the Covid era. He is a late starter himself: a former magazine editor in Dubai and Tokyo who returned to the UK in his late 30s, he found out about his morris-dancing grandfather after his father died. “Most people have an affair or buy a sports car for their midlife crisis,” he laughs. “I fell for traditional music, then fell down the rabbit hole.” He has found many others like him who are not from a folk background or family drawn in what he calls “the idea of shared traditions, folk memory and a collective unconscious”. Wassails in the dark of winter seem to hold a particular appeal, he says. “Standing in a field lighting fires or making noise with other people at the toughest time of year, feels like what we all need, especially when we all live digital lives, being constantly bombarded with bad news.” He mentions one of his interviews on Tradfolk with the artist Ben Edge, sometime video director for Fat White Family and Raf Rundell, and curator of last year’s Ritual Britain exhibition at the Museum of British Folklore. Edge thought there was “no coincidence that we are dealing with the climate crisis and people are looking for immediate ways to reconnect with nature and have a sincere concern for the land”. People often found these rituals peculiar at first, Edge explained, then spotted something “profoundly human and universal” in them. “And when you think about how we haven’t spent time together with strangers in recent years, doing something celebratory with them, safely, outside, becomes even more powerful,” says Wilks. But wassails have changed in their nature a lot, says the folk historian Steve Roud, creator of the Roud folk song index and writer of The English Year. They were first recorded as an activity in the middle ages, and although many claim ancient or pagan origins for them, there “is no evidence for this – it could only be pure speculation or guesswork”, says Roud. The word wassail comes from “waes hael”, a phrase in Old English and Old Norse meaning “be healthy”, although this meaning gained intimations of celebration through time (the songs sung at these rituals are also known as wassails). Wassails have become subject to “a kind of touristification”, Roud says, “and that means things might be changed about customs to please other people – not that this is good or bad. It’s just the way the modern world is.” But he does warn against people trying to “project their present preoccupations backwards in time to explain the way things were”. For him, wassailing was less a spiritual activity in agricultural communities than something that served an earthier purpose. “Wassails were basically excuses for men to get drunk,” he says brightly. “They were also very local, not at all about attracting outsiders into a community.” People often ignore that wassailing was also about poverty and begging for money; in agricultural communities, after all, there was little work in the winter. Wassailing also used to come in two kinds: the crop-blessing form and the house-visiting wassail (often involving women, going house to house with a wassail bowl to share a drink, usually cider, giving luck for the year). Some elements have thankfully been evolved out: morris men still wear face paint, but blackface is much less common. In June 2020, the Joint Morris Organisation, comprising members from different morris federations, said it would bar from its events any sides that wore blackface. “Morris is a living tradition,” it said in a statement, “and it is right that it has always adapted and evolved to reflect society.” Some still claim its use was innocent and divorced from issues of race, but Nicholas Wall of the English Folk Dance and Song Society has persuasively argued that this part of the tradition had strong ties to minstrelsy. Similar customs to wassailing, such as the Mari Lwyd in south Wales, first recorded in the early 19th century, added mischief to the mix. A man draped in a cloak carried a horse’s skull on a stick, creating a terrifying creature. Going door to door with friends, he would engage in a ritual with homeowners called pwnco, exchanging rude rhymes. “These rituals were also often threatening, as trick or treating used to be,” Roud adds. “And they always ended with money being given before the wassailers went away.”Mari Lwyds have been revived in recent years at festivals in Chepstow, and at local celebrations in Newport and Llanwrtyd Wells; many wassailing traditions today still play to folklore’s eerie underbelly. At Eardisland, we are told to shout, at a safe distance, to get rid of evil spirits. The spectre of Covid is not far from these incantations. “Everybody shout to scare this thing away!” Johnson bellows. Newer sides, such as Blackthorn Border morris, formed in 2019, present a darker, more gothic exploration of folklore. In Wilks’ assessment, they’re “thrillingly aggressive … the heavy metal of morris!” Comprised of long-time dancers and newcomers, and performing under character names such as Raven and Death’s Head Hawkmoth, they dance in local sacred sites on the Welsh borders, such as Hay Bluff and Arthur’s Stone.Herefordshire born-and-bred member Nyssa Ebert – AKA recorder player and singer Hare – joined in early 2020. She has long been a Wiccan practitioner, a world she describes “as very underground 20 years ago, but it’s now very open and accepting and present on social media”. This is also how she found and joined Blackthorn Border morris.But she does not claim wassailing as a pagan activity. “We’ll never know whether its roots are pagan or Christian, but I don’t think that matters – to me, a wassail’s an ultimate expression of folk magic, and of bringing the idea of blessings into your community, for families, and the nature around you.” She wonders whether pandemic lockdowns have heightened this connection, she says, helping to explain why they’re prospering now. “Suddenly, last year we weren’t waylaid by the drive to work or the madness of the school run. We were noticing snowdrops coming up and the blossoms of the hawthorn. We were looking around us again, having reverence and respect for the seasons of the year.”The wassail was once about escape from punishing impoverishment; perhaps it is now about escape from the onslaught of modernity, and how folk traditions adapt to our world as living, breathing things. It is also, Wilks says, “about thinking about the people who went before us, and about our hope for the future – and how we express that in the coldest, darkest months”. As the light lengthens on another tough winter, it’s hard not to lift your bowl of cider to that.",Arts/Music,"Fire, cider and ‘heavy metal morris dancing’: the resurgence of wassailing",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/fire-cider-and-heavy-metal-morris-dancing-the-resurgence-of-wassailing
1/13/2022,"The number of Covid patients in hospitals in England and Scotland has continued to rise this week, as NHS England reached a deal with private hospitals to free up beds amid the outbreak of Omicron cases. Meanwhile, Covid staff absences in England rose to their highest level since the introduction of the vaccine. The number of NHS workers in England off sick because of Covid was up by 41% in the week to 2 January, according to the latest figures.  Five health workers describe some of the challenges they are facing, including understaffing, waiting times and bed-blocking. Ambulances are becoming a service for everything With this new variant, we’re still seeing Covid patients, but they’ve stayed at the same rate as before. The Covid patients that we see are those that haven’t had vaccines. In the last month I’ve seen four or five Covid patients – none of them were vaccinated. One hospital in the area has a really bad problem with ambulance queues – up to six and a half hours, and the standard wait time is over an hour. At other hospitals, you queue for one or two hours max. There’s no movement. They aren’t able to get people out of A&E on to wards, I guess because they’re not getting people out of wards. That’s due to a lack of care homes and care in the community. If you’ve got somebody who lives alone and can’t walk – we see a lot of that – how can they be sent home until they can walk? And that can take months. The main jobs we’re going out to haven’t changed – it’s still old people that have fallen, people that can’t walk, people that need antibiotics. Those are the main bread and butter jobs. If GPs, district nurses and care homes were able to cover these jobs, things would function much better. I think the ambulance service is becoming everything, including social services. No one even raises an eyebrow at a 10-and-a-half-hour wait in emergency The pressure is increasing on workload and capacity. There’s just so much Covid – staff are catching it and having to self-isolate. So, from mid-December we’ve been running with major gaps across all kinds of disciplines: nursing, medical, radiographers, cleaners. People aren’t terribly ill but obviously they’ve got to stay home. Our in-patient Covid numbers have doubled in the last few weeks, but the numbers are not rising to the levels of last January. We can manage, we know how to manage Covid, we’ve got the skill set. But the biggest problem is capacity in the hospital because we don’t have enough beds. We’ve got about 40 to 50 Covid patients taking up two wards. We’ve had to close some wards because of having to staff them, so that further reduces our capacity. This morning we had a 10-and-a-half hour wait – no one even raises an eyebrow at that anymore. Five years ago we’d have all been running around with our hair on fire if the wait was more than four hours. A lot of nurses are going to agencies We probably have about 10 critical care beds free at the moment but we just don’t have the staff. A lot of people are off with Covid, and lately a lot of senior nurses, who are normally in charge of eight patients, have moved to new jobs. They’ve gone to different places, like specialist jobs in the community, that are just easier for them or their families, if they can do a nine to five kind of job rather than doing night shifts. They’re still doubling up patients in ITU [intensive therapy units] – one nurse to two patients, as they were in October. We haven’t really seen many flu patients, which is odd for this time of year, it does just seem to be Covid patients. There’s a lot of patients that are classed as “wardable”, but the wards are so busy that they can’t really facilitate it. We say that we’re struggling, but then when we hear how the ward is, they actually do sound worse than us. They barely have a bed free. The trauma patients who are coming in now, because of a head injury or a cardiac arrest or whatever it is, are often Covid positive as well. So even if they’re admitted for something else, we have to put them in the Covid pod. A few people are slowly giving up because [the pressure] is still quite heavy, and I think we were hoping it would be easier by now. A lot of people are going to agencies. At an agency, they’ll pay me about £60 an hour for being a critical care nurse, whereas on average, I’ll get paid £18 an hour at my hospital. So a lot of nurses are reducing their hours at my hospital, so they can work more hours elsewhere. That’s probably what I’m going to do. We’re trying not to leave our hospital because we feel bad about it, but we can add more money on the side. You come to accept these levels of staffing Red levels of staffing have become the norm – we’ve become used to running on minimum staffing now, the issue has moved on to ‘can you run safely at all’. You come to accept these levels of staffing. We’re seeing people who are getting Covid for a second time, including among staff who had it in the first wave. They’re mostly less unwell this time, whether due to the variant, vaccine, and prior immunity. Everyone is grateful they’re less unwell this time, but they’re still off – it doesn’t make any difference to your staffing numbers. Fortunately, the number of presentations of children with respiratory illness wasn’t as bad as expected – it tailed off a bit before Christmas in terms of numbers. Schools have just gone back so we’re waiting to see what happens next. Respiratory illnesses continued but didn’t spike – we’ve seen numbers of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fall in recent weeks, which is reassuring, but we don’t know yet if there’ll be another peak. We test all admissions, and last week, for the first time, the most commonly isolated virus in the children’s emergency department was Covid. Usually it would be normal winter viruses, like rhinovirus [one of the viruses that causes the common cold]. It’s not the case that more children are unwell with Covid – they’re mostly incidental findings. This just represents the fact that community rates of Covid are so high at the moment. I’m preparing to hand my notice in I wake up every morning with the dread of further staff shortages. Last week we had a number of colleagues with Covid or waiting for results. There’s always a big backlog at the start of the year, after we’ve been closed for a few days, and we had to reschedule the whole diary for the practice. Staff who are well are having to pick up extra shifts to make sure we’re covered. People are doing a lot of overtime – some are doing something like 40 more hours a month. That’s effectively an extra week’s work. Everyone is emotionally and physically drained. We’re expected to kind of get through the same workload without making any mistakes. When you’re rushing, or when people are tired and trying to get through a huge amount of work, mistakes can happen. Things are being missed – thankfully nothing serious, but it feels like it’s only a matter of time. GP practices have been getting really bad press. People seem to have this idea that nothing is happening in the practice, when everybody is running themselves ragged. You can’t help but take it home with you. And the thing is that when I leave work, I just become another person living in a pandemic. Right now, I can’t see why I’m staying. When the pandemic started, I think it felt like I was doing my bit. I’ve done my bit and now I’m tired. I’m preparing to hand my notice in and debating whether I can face going back at all or whether to admit defeat and take sick leave.",News/Society,‘Red levels of staffing are the norm’: NHS workers on coping with Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/13/nhs-workers-covid-omicron-coronavirus-red-levels-staffing
1/13/2022,"Next has become one of the first large UK retailers to cut sick pay for its unvaccinated staff who have to isolate after coming into contact with someone with Covid. However, staff who have not been jabbed will still receive sick pay if they test positive for the virus.  People in the UK who are not vaccinated and who are a close contact of someone who has tested positive are required to self-isolate for 10 days. This requirement does not apply for people who are fully vaccinated. Next told the BBC, which first reported the move, that it was an “emotive topic” but it had to balance the needs of staff and shareholders. The fashion and homeware retailer, which employs more than 37,000 people in the UK, has been grappling with higher levels of staff absence as a result of the spread of the Omicron variant. Next’s change to its sick pay policy is understood to have been made recently, and comes days after a similar move by Ikea, which employs 10,000 people in the UK. Unvaccinated workers at Next and Ikea will only be eligible for statutory sick pay – which is currently set at £96.35 a week – during their 10 days of isolation, unless there are mitigating circumstances. This compares with weekly pay of more than £400 before tax for an average store worker at Ikea. Morrisons supermarket announced in September that it was cutting sick pay during self-isolation for its unvaccinated workers, as part of a move to cut its pandemic-related costs. Meanwhile the UK’s largest grocer, Tesco, will limit the amount of paid sick leave that unvaccinated staff are able to take while self-isolating. Unjabbed Tesco employees who do not test positive for Covid but have to self-isolate will not receive lower pay, but will use up some of their company sick pay entitlement, as they would for other illnesses. This is not the case for any Tesco staff who test positive for Covid. Next’s chief executive, Simon Wolfson, said Omicron had not impacted the retailer’s sales but it had led to rising staff absences in its shops and warehouses as people had to self-isolate, although it had not forced the company to close any of its stores. “Absenteeism is definitely a factor at the moment and sickness levels are higher than we would normally expect at this time of the year,” Lord Wolfson told Bloomberg.",News/Business,Next cuts sick pay for unvaccinated staff who are self-isolating,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/13/next-cuts-sick-pay-unvaccinated-staff-self-isolating-covid
1/13/2022,"Good morning. Yesterday the House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack formally asked the Republican House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, to cooperate with its inquiry into the 6 January insurrection.  “We must learn about how the president’s plans for 6 January came together, and all the other ways he attempted to alter the results of the election,” Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, said in a letter to McCarthy. McCarthy responded late Wednesday that he would not cooperate with the investigation, setting the stage for a bitter political showdown. McCarthy had spoken directly to Donald Trump on the day the former president’s supporters stormed the US Capitol to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win. The committee’s request to McCarthy marks a significant political moment for the investigation as they examine potential criminal conduct by the former president. Federal health authorities in the US are now comparing the pandemic to a “natural disaster”, warning that the Omicron Covid-19 variant is so contagious it is likely most people in the US will be infected. “I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is [that] most people are going to get Covid, all right?” Janet Woodcock, the acting head of the Food and Drug Administration, said at a Senate hearing. “What we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function … [that] transportation, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.” On the day of the Senate hearing, more than 761,000 Americans tested positive for Covid-19. On the same day the previous year, also the peak of a winter surge, an average of 251,232 people tested positive. In a leaked memo, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, detailed a strategy wherein the House would amend an unrelated bill about Nasa to include provisions from two stalled voting reform bills: the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. This strategy would allow Democrats to evade an initial filibuster from Republicans seeking to block debate on the bill. Senate Democrats at the moment lack the votes to pass filibuster reform, as Schumer vowed to do in order to push forward on voting rights. Moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema remain opposed to amending the filibuster. While the strategy would allow for open debate on the voting reform bills, it wouldn’t ultimately resolve the fact in an evenly split Senate, Republicans could still use the filibuster to block a final vote on passing the legislation. Ronnie Spector, whose hits included Be My Baby and who defined the sound of mid-century girl groups as the frontwoman of the Ronettes, has died at 78, following a brief battle with cancer. Extreme Republicans loyal to Donald Trump – and to his lies that the 2020 presidential election was rigged – have formed a nationwide alliance aiming to take control of the presidential election process in key battleground states. With at least eight Republicans who are currently running to serve as chief election officials in crucial swing states, this alliance could determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential race. Prince Andrew remains embroiled in lengthy and embarrassing legal proceedings after a Manhattan judge rejected yesterday the royal’s efforts to dismiss Virginia Giuffre’s sexual abuse lawsuit against him. He denies all her allegations. Donald Trump hung up on a national radio host halfway through a scheduled interview after the host pushed him about his lies about the 2020 presidential election. A woman’s diary has gone viral after lockdown forced her to stay on a blind date in China. 2021 was the worst year on record for online child sex abuse, according to the Internet Watch Foundation. The CDC director, Dr Rochelle Walensky, said at a senate health hearing this week that the infections on cruise ships have continued to skyrocket, upending the industry and leaving passengers stranded aboard ships. At the end of December, cases jumped to 5,013 – up from only 162 in the first two weeks of December. “Just over the last two weeks with Omicron, we’ve seen a 30-fold increase in cases on ships,” Walensky said. Barely a month into the promotion to principal of Colleyville Heritage High, Dr James Whitfield sent a letter to his students in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, hoping to reassure them as protests rocked across the nation. Within months of sending that letter, he’d be put on paid administrative leave pending investigation. “Nobody in the community was calling me or anything,” he said about the initial response to the letter. “But I started to hear word that: ‘Hey. these people are talking about you and they’re saying you’re doing critical race theory.’” A record number of Americans are now becoming increasingly alarmed by the climate crisis, according to a new study published by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. The study, which categorized Americans into six groups ranging from the alarmed to the dismissive, found that the alarmed group, at 33%, greatly outnumbered the dismissive group, at 9%, by more than three to one.

1/13/2022,"It was a pretty comprehensive put-down from an erstwhile colleague. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader and flag-carrier for the rebellion against Boris Johnson, is “a lightweight figure” of little consequence. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons and one of the prime minister’s closest allies, did very little to mask his disdain for Ross when he said so. Within hours of Ross’s demand for Johnson to resign, Rees-Mogg had gone on the attack. “I don’t think Douglas Ross is a big figure,” he told the broadcaster LBC. “He has been constantly in opposition to the prime minister, against Brexit; he is not somebody you would expect to say helpful things about the prime minister.”  Some hours later Rees-Mogg doubled down. Interviewed by Kirsty Wark on Newsnight, he said: “Douglas Ross has always been quite a lightweight figure.” Alister Jack, the Scotland secretary and one of Ross’s five Scottish colleagues at Westminster, was “a much more substantial and important figure in this”. That dismissive and patronising tone grabbed people’s attention. It was intended to. It was a diversion designed to shift the story on to one individual. Ross was serially disloyal, Rees-Mogg implied; he had resigned as a junior minister in Johnson’s government in May 2020 over Dominic Cummings’ rule-breaking drive to Barnard Castle. Setting aside the inaccuracy of Rees-Mogg’s charge that Ross has not championed Brexit – he has – this strategy was intended to conceal a far more uncomfortable truth for Johnson, his cabinet and the Tory party at large: with the exception of Jack and perhaps one or two others, Ross has near unanimous support within the Scottish party. The party of the union is now deeply disunited. Ross has been backed by both his predecessors as Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw and Ruth Davidson, who was appointed by Johnson to the House of Lords. Although not all 30 other Tory MSPs have yet publicly lined up behind Ross’s banner, at least 26 have. Davidson, perhaps with an eye on her new gig as a Times Radio host, was the first to openly question Johnson’s position this week. She delivered a remarkable 13 Westminster seats in the 2017, helping Theresa May narrowly win that general election, and had once been mooted as a future prime minister. Under her leadership, the Tories pulled off the remarkable feat of replacing Labour as the main opposition at Holyrood, doubling its seats. This Scottish Tory revolt was undoubtedly coordinated. It is also freighted with risk. The evidence that this civil war is truly fratricidal became clear when Michael Gove, a fellow Scot, became the first to slap Ross down. Asked about Ross’s calls for Johnson to quit, Gove said: “My instant response is he’s in Elgin and the national Tory leader is in London.” The revolt is at a very delicate stage. Apart from Jack’s presumed loyalty to Johnson, Scotland’s four other Tory MPs – Andrew Bowie, David Duguid, John Lamont and David Mundell – have kept quiet, as have nearly all other Tory MPs. With the exception of Bowie, they also hold junior roles in the government so are watching and waiting, to see if other revelations emerge and then for the results of the investigation into partygate by the senior mandarin Sue Gray. Nonetheless, they share Ross and Davidson’s anxieties. They insist Johnson’s very poor reputation among Scottish voters is “priced in” but they have real fears the successive revelations about No 10’s disdain for its own lockdown regulations, the mishandling of the Owen Paterson crisis and Johnson’s generally shambolic leadership over Brexit are doing deep damage to the party’s brand as a whole, and thus to Scottish voters’ confidence in the union. They also face an immediate challenge holding their seats in May’s Scottish council elections, and are watching the polls give the UK Labour party a 10-point lead. While Ross successfully defended all 31 Scottish Tory seats at the last Holyrood elections against expectations, he does not have Davidson’s appeal to liberal voters or her subtlety. Ross’s domestic strategy is to appeal to an arch-unionist base. So any loss of confidence in the Tory brand at UK level is doubly damaging. The significance of the stakes for the pro-union camp were summed up by Andrew Percy, the Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole. He chastised Rees-Mogg for attacking Ross: “As someone who apparently loves the union, his personal attack on Douglas ... is a gift to the petty nationalists in the SNP who want to break this country up.”",News/Politics,Rees-Mogg’s Douglas Ross attack betrays desperation to change narrative,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/rees-moggs-douglas-ross-attack-betrays-desperation-to-change-narrative

I think she was ready for a confrontation.Yolanta I ordered an orange juice, then chicken with a mushroom sauce.Amanda I ordered gamberoni, then penne piccante. Amanda We both read lots of papers, but I don’t read the Sun or the Mail. She said, “I read the Sun, but it’s not an intelligent paper.” Well, don’t read it then, would be my answer to that. She talked about the refugees arriving on the coast. My whole feeling is one of compassion. What a horrendous way to arrive in a country, desperate and alone. What have you left, to make that journey? Yolanta All the people who come, they’re all young – 18, 20, 25 years old. They come here just to live on benefits. People come without documents, and why? Western countries cannot solve all the world’s problems. It is not a leftwing opinion, but it is my opinion. Amanda She thinks people come here for a free house, to live for free. I said, “But they only get £39 a week” and she replied, “Well they could buy a loaf of bread.” She was very fixed against people arriving. The day we met [which was before 27 people died in the Channel’s worst mass drowning], crossings from France were getting a lot of coverage. But I look at the big picture. I read about Calais and the horrendous things people go through, the violence there. I don’t see people arriving in dinghies as a threat. I just see them being kicked from country to country. Yolanta They come here and they do not want to work, and they do not behave or dress as if they want to integrate. Amanda I think if you read the Sun, you’re going to read a lot of bile. Amanda She assumed I’d voted for Brexit. So it took the wind out of her sails, because I’m very pro-European and I voted to stay in. She said she had a whole speech ready to challenge my Brexit views. That was good in a way, because it broke the ice. Yolanta Let’s say for travelling, I am very pro-European. But if you want to work here, or if you want to live here, or if you want to get benefits, that has to be controlled. A strict control. Amanda I knew she’d been in the UK 15 years, and I was ready to think, “You’ve had freedom of movement, you’ve come here, and now I haven’t got freedom of movement.” But that’s not the kind of freedom of movement she minds. Yolanta We agreed that it is very nice to travel in the EU. But she told me that it would be difficult to get medical treatment in EU countries now. Yolanta We disagreed on Black Lives Matter. That police officer, of course he was guilty. But I do not think that he wanted to kill George Floyd. The most important thing was that Floyd had a criminal record. Amanda I thought, “Oh right, so you think he deserved to have a knee on his neck and die in that way?” I hate this term woke, but I am woke and I am aware of injustice in the world, and I find it really difficult not to have compassion. The way he died was abhorrent and wrong. You can’t take away someone’s right to justice because they’ve got a colourful background. Yolanta I think we agreed on many things and everything was very nice. Amanda We’re so far apart that we couldn’t find any common ground. But it was really interesting, and, because of my health now, I’m just grateful for the experience. I’ve had four kidney transplants, bowel surgery, heart surgery, and I’m running on empty.

1/13/2022,"Museum of Mechanics is a fascinating concept – a virtual hall of exhibits, featuring faithfully recreated examples of one idea (in this case, lock-picking) from games throughout history, alongside the curator’s explanation and analysis of each. The intended audience are game developers, but it’s enjoyable for anyone interested in the history of video games, and how they can approach the same idea in so many different ways. I came away from it with a renewed appreciation for the thought that goes into these seemingly minor elements of game design. When you reached a locked door in the original Fallout, your character’s stats and abilities influenced a behind-the-scenes dice roll to determine whether you could unlock it and move past. Games such as Skyrim give you on-screen picks that must be rotated in virtual locks. And in Mass Effect, you gained access by playing a hacking mini-game (the distinction between lock-picking and hacking is something that designer Johnnemann Nordhagen is quite preoccupied with, incidentally). All of these are recreated here alongside some much more obscure approaches, such as that of cult-hit Russian plague-game Pathologic 2, or Alpha Protocol’s timed lock-tumblers. There’s a nostalgic interest here for anyone who’s been playing games for a long time – I’d forgotten about all the time I’d spent tentatively feeling out locks in fantasy worlds. Now I know exactly how that little mechanic works, and why it felt so good to use.  The museum itself is pretty rudimentary: a dark hall, with signposted identical locks pointing the way towards Nordhagen’s recreations of lock-picking mini-games. It looks and sounds basic, but the amount of effort, knowledge and understanding of the topic (and of game design and history more generally) that has gone into this mini museum is abundantly evident, from both the exhibits and the text that accompanies them. Like listening to someone talk about the PhD research they’re doing on a niche topic, it might sound boring at the outset, but by the end of an hour, you’ll come away with something you definitely didn’t know before.
