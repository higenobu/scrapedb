3/24/2022,"The short answer to this question is, ""Yes, provided you are prepared to accept a modest standard of living."" To get an an idea of what a 60-year-old individual with a $300,000 nest egg faces, our list of factors to check includes estimates of their income, before and after starting to receive Social Security, as well as expenses after retirement. Your own prospects in this kind of situation will vary, but by doing the sorts of calculations and estimates below, you'll have a reasonable idea of what it will take for you to retire at 60 with $300,000. Consider working with a financial advisor as you explore your prospects for retiring early. Income After Retirement: Social Security A good place to start your assessment of whether you can retire at 60 with $300,000 is by looking at sources of income, including Social Security. The program is reverse-means tested, meaning that the less money you made during your working years the less generous your benefits in retirement. Earnings scale up to the maximum Social Security income, after which additional earnings no longer add to your lifetime benefits. The maximum taxable income changes each year based on inflation. In 2022, it is set at $147,000, meaning that during 2022 you accrue the most Social Security credits if you earn up to that amount. If you earn less, you will collect fewer benefits when you retire. If you earn more, it will not add to your benefits. Your benefits also change based on when you decide to retire. You receive the smallest amount of money if you file at age 62, scaling up each month that you wait until a maximum benefit payment at age 70. The standard set of benefits are paid at full retirement age, which is set at 66 years and four months for everyone under the age of 65 at time of writing. Finally, Social Security benefits change each year as the Social Security Administration and Congress adjust this payment for inflation. For 2022, the average retiree Social Security is $1,657 per month. For the purposes of this article we will assume a retiree who begins collecting benefits at full retirement age receives the average payment. You can calculate your own estimated benefits at the Social Security Administration's website. Income After Retirement: Investments and Savings The average retirement account generates an average return of about 5% annually. Some estimates place this number higher, but we'll use conservative math. With a retirement account of $300,000, this means an average return of about $15,000 per year. If you withdraw only those returns, you can generate income from your retirement portfolio without drawing down on the principal. Let's assume there are no income sources besides this $300,000 retirement account and average Social Security benefits. In this situation, an annual 2022 income would be: $15,000 from retirement savings $19,884 from Social Security payments ($1,657 per month) Total: $34,884 ($2,907 per month) Income Before Social Security The first two, six or eight years, depending on when you decide to start taking Social Security, will be the most financially challenging. For example, if you begin collecting benefits at age 62 (the earliest you can do so), you cut your lifetime benefits to 70% of full value. In the case of an average Social Security benefit, this means that you reduce your Social Security benefits to $1,160 monthly or $13,919 annually and cut your total annual income (Social Security plus investment income) down to $28,918, or $2,410 per month. In most cases, you will have to wait until age 66 and four months to collect enough Social Security for a stable retirement. If you want to retire early, you will have to find a way to replace your income during that six-year period. In most cases $300,000 is simply not enough money on which to retire early. If you retire at age 60, you will have to live on your $15,000 drawdown and nothing more. This is close to the $12,760 poverty line for an individual and translates into a monthly income of about $1,250 per month. Potential Pitfalls As tempting as it would be to draw down the principal of your retirement account, resist the urge. Consider the consequences of not resisting. To match the estimated $34,884 per year budget, you would need to withdraw $19,884 per year from the principal of your retirement account in addition to withdrawing all of its average returns, so nothing will replace those withdrawals. Over a six-year period this would chop your retirement account to $119,304 from $300,000. And as your withdrawals shrink your nest egg's balance, that balance would produce less and less income. By the time you begin collecting Social Security, relatively little would be left of your original $300,000. Therefore, with a $300,000 retirement account, the odds are you will need to wait until full retirement age before collecting Social Security benefits. Collecting Social Security early reduces your benefits for each month you start before full retirement age. If you begin collecting benefits at age 62 (the earliest you can do so), you cut your lifetime benefits to 70% of full value. In the case of an average Social Security benefit, this means that you reduce your Social Security benefits to $1,160 monthly or $13,919 annually, and your total income (Social Security plus investment income) down to $28,918 or $2,410 per month. For most people this is not a practical budget. It is just a little over 200% of the national poverty line for an individual ($12,760 per year in 2022) and well below the median income. Even if practical for a short period of time, this budget leaves no room for unexpected or growing expenses. These could include higher medical bills as you age or inflation. It also removes any flexibility to adjust for market downturns in your retirement. For most retirees, if possible, you should wait until full retirement age. Retirement Expenses: Taxes With a good sense of your annual income based on a $300,000 retirement, the next question is simple: Will that be enough? With $34,884 in annual income and a planned retirement age of 60, we need to anticipate three main issues: Taxes, expenses and pre-Social Security expenses. You may have to plan on paying income taxes in retirement. This depends on a number of factors, most critically whether you primarily used a 401(k) or IRA (which taxes your withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (which does not tax withdrawals). Social Security benefits may also be taxed, depending on how much you earn. While not fully accurate, the best way to estimate if you will owe taxes on Social Security is to take half of your benefits and add them to the rest of your income. For an individual, if this comes to more than $25,000 per year from all sources, you will likely owe taxes. In our case we would calculate taxes as follows: Social Security benefits = $19,884 $19,884 ÷ 2 = $9,942 All other income = $15,000 $15,000 + $9,942 = $24,942 When it comes to taxes, a miss is as good as a mile. We are below the $25,000 cutoff for individuals, and so our Social Security benefits won't see taxes. This leaves us with only $15,000 of potentially taxable income. But individuals avoid taxes on capital gains below $40,400, so there are also no taxes on this money. Now, it's important to understand that we did not include potential state taxes in this analysis. And individual circumstances will vary. However, in this case, with $300,000 in retirement savings, average Social Security benefits and an individual filer, we can expect to pay no federal taxes in 2022. Retirement Expenses: Annual Cost of Living With $300,000 and Social Security, you can expect to collect just under $35,000 per year. On a monthly basis, that works out to about $2,900 per month. Is that enough to live on? It depends on numerous variables: Do you pay a mortgage or rent? Groceries Utilities What are your taxes (property, state and federal)? What are your insurance (auto, life, medical, long-term care) expenses? The above lists ignores entirely discretionary and luxury expenditures like travel and vacations. Even more critically, the above-listed expenses will rise yearly due to inflation. In general, a retirement income of $35,000 is not unrealistic. At time of writing the median individual income in America, according to the St. Louis Fed, is $35,805. An income of approximately $35,000 is livable in the U.S. However, much of that depends on where you choose to live. Taking a retirement account like this to Kalamazoo, Michigan will be far more practical than trying to live in Chicago. Reasons for Optimism When trying to estimate your own lifestyle needs, most experts recommend estimating between two-thirds and three-quarters of your pre-retirement income. While working, you'll have expenses that you won't carry into retirement. In turn, you'll also have more flexibility to move somewhere less expensive. That means that you'll need less money than during your working life, though lifestyle bills can still add up. In the case of a $34,884 retirement income, this estimate puts us around a pre-retirement income of $50,000 per year. If you earned around $50,000 per year before retirement, the odds are good that a $300,000 retirement account and Social Security benefits will allow you to continue enjoying your same lifestyle. Bottom Line By age 55 the median American household has about $120,000 saved for retirement, and about $212,500 in net worth. So getting to $300,000 by 60 means you'll have to be a better saver or investor than the average American. That's because for the majority of people, early retirement is probably off the table. But if you're willing to budget and keep an eye – a very close eye – on your expenses, it is possible. Just remember that the years between age 60 and whenever you begin getting Social Security will be the most challenging.

3/24/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian rouble briefly leapt to a three-week high past 95 against the dollar on Wednesday in Moscow, before settling close to 100, after President Vladimir Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly countries"" in roubles. The potential ramifications of that move, which Putin ordered his government to sort out in one week, could boost the Russian currency, with a host of European countries still dependent on Moscow for much of their energy supplies. By 1313 GMT, the rouble was 3.4% stronger against the dollar at 100.02, earlier clipping 94.9875, its strongest since March 2. It had gained 3.5% to trade at 110.50 versus the euro. The rouble had stabilised near 105 to the dollar in recent sessions after falling to a record low of 120 in Moscow this month and even further on the interbank market to 150. Russia has taken a hit from unprecedented Western sanctions over events in Ukraine, what it terms a ""special operation"", that started on Feb. 24. Before that, the rouble traded at about 80 to the dollar. Trading in OFZ bonds resumed this week, and the Bank of Russia announced some stock market trading would resume on March 24 after a near month-long hiatus, with 33 securities included into the benchmark IMOEX index set to be traded on the Moscow Exchange for a limited period of time and with short selling banned. COUPON PAYMENT Russia appeared to have averted default on foreign debt by making a coupon payment on a sovereign Eurobond, maturing in 2029, in U.S. dollars. A bondholder said the payment had been received. But Russian holders of domestic corporate Eurobonds face delays in receiving payments settled through international agents, as transactions get snarled up by sanctions, Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD), companies and analysts said. Demand for rouble liquidity has declined as the central bank sold 0.8 trillion roubles ($7.7 billion) at a one-day ""fine-tuning"" repo auction on Wednesday, lower than in previous days. ""Demand at overnight repo auctions is falling fast,"" Veles Capital brokerage said in a note, explaining that even though banks' liquidity levels have fallen to their lowest since June last year, lenders are repaying previous repo debts to the central bank. OFZ BONDS STEADY Trading on the OFZ bond market continued for a third day after it was shut in late February. The central bank said last week it would begin buying OFZ bonds to limit volatility, after it held its key interest rate at 20% in the wake of an emergency rate hike in late February. The central bank has so far not disclosed the size of its interventions on the OFZ market that helped stabilise prices and provided extra liquidity to the financial system. Yields on benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, stood at 13.90% on Wednesday after hitting a record high of 19.74% on Monday.

3/24/2022,"Warren Buffett is channeling one of his long-held investing philosophies in his recent flurry of buzzy deals, says one fellow value-focused investor. That is to be greedy when others in the market are fearful. ""I think he is reminding us that when the tide goes out, we see who has been swimming,"" remarked Research Affiliates CEO Chris Brightman on Yahoo Finance Live. The 91-year-old billionaire investor revealed Monday that his Berkshire Hathaway will spend $11.6 billion to buy insurance company Alleghany. The deal will expand Buffett's insurance empire further beyond auto insurance player Geico and reinsurance beast Gen Re (General Reinsurance Corporation). Alleghany hauled in more than $12 billion in sales last year and $1.1 billion in net earnings. While diving deeper into the insurance space, Buffett has also gone shopping for energy names amid soaring crude oil prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Buffett scooped up another 18.1 million shares of Occidental for close to $1 billion last week. The latest purchases come hot on the heels of Berkshire spending $6 billion or so in the prior two weeks to buy up Occidental shares. Berkshire now owns nearly 14.6% of Occidental Petroleum through his roughly 140 million shares. The company will hold a key investor day on Wednesday. Interestingly these deals arrive despite Buffett's favorite stock market indicator flashing overvalued. Other investing pros echo Brightman's sentiment on Buffett's latest moves. They also point to Buffett likely realizing the world will eventually move beyond near-term headwinds such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis. ""I think it [the deals] reminds me and should remind [everyone] that the world is still spinning. Companies are still planning for the future, and they are still doing the things that make them great companies,"" Baird strategist Michael Antonelli said on Yahoo Finance Live.

3/24/2022,"With inflation and growth concerns swirling over the markets, Jerome Powell dropped a tantalizing clue on Monday about how the Federal Reserve will approach its next rate-setting meeting in May. To have spotted the sign, you’d have to be a top-notch Fed-jargon parser. In a speech yesterday, Powell added a new adverb—“expeditiously”—to his vocabulary about just how aggressively the central bank could hike rates this year. He also signaled being open to a 50-basis–point rate hike, all but closing the door on a 13-year stretch of loose monetary policy and rock-bottom lending rates. Wall Street pounced on the Powell speech, with a series of new bets that the Fed will be even more hawkish than previously thought. “Our best guess is that the shift in wording from ‘steadily’ in January to ‘expeditiously’ today is a signal that a 50bp rate hike is coming,” Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in an investor note. “We now forecast 50bp hikes at both the May and June meetings, followed by 25bp hikes at the four remaining meetings in the back half of 2022, and three quarterly hikes in 2023 Q1–Q3.” Add that up, and the benchmark Federal funds interest rate could move above 3% in 18 months’ time—not great news for aspiring homebuyers or people who have variable-rate mortgages. The Fed’s aggressive ramp-up in rates is looking like nothing we’ve seen in recent years, noted Jim Reid, Deutsche Bank global head of thematic research, a sign the central bank feels it’s behind the curve in keeping inflation—running at a 40-year-high—in check. “It’s increasingly dawning on investors that this is going to be a very different hiking cycle from its predecessor back in 2015, and yesterday Fed funds futures moved to price in more than 200bps worth of hikes for 2022 for the first time (including the 25bps we saw last week),” Reid wrote on Tuesday. Following the Powell speech, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped 14 basis points on Monday, and equities sank in afternoon trading. U.S. futures are doing a bit better on Tuesday, with the S&P up 0.4% at 5 a.m. ET. European bourses were in the green at the open as well, as most risk assets were rebounding. Crypto prices, for example, were gaining with Bitcoin up to $42,500, an increase of more than 3% in the past 24 hours. Investors are taking heart that the closely watched spread between short- and long-term bonds—measured as the difference between the yield on a two-year Treasury note and that of a 10-year Treasury note—has been widening in recent weeks, a sign that Wall Street sees the chance of a recession is on the wane.

3/24/2022,"After a period of sustained losses, the stock market has been staging a comeback, with valuations across the board moving in one direction – higher. Between March 14 and March 23, the S&P 500 rose ~8%, while the NASDAQ was up ~12%. Oppenheimer’s Chief Investment Strategist John Stoltzfus offers an explanation for the powerful rally: “In our view it wasn’t so much that investor sentiment had turned broadly positive last week but rather that enough investors started to see numerous positives among economic data points and corporate management commentaries and actions to offset a deluge of worries that have dogged the markets since early this year.” In fact, the major equity benchmarks are now above the levels they were when Russia first invaded Ukraine, suggesting to Stoltzfus that “projections of the impact on the US from the hostilities in Eastern Europe have been overblown.” Investors will be keeping an eye on a range of economic and macro data presented this week to see if that rally was just a one-off or if sentiment has truly turned. In the meantime, Stoltzfus continues to “favor equities in the current transitional environment.” With this in mind, the stock analysts at Oppenheimer have made it easier to find equites that are particularly promising. They have pinpointed two names which they believe are ready to blast higher – in the order of at least 90%. Using the TipRanks database, we can get idea what the rest of the Street thinks lies in store for these stocks. Let's take a closer look. aTyr Pharma (LIFE) We’re talking about at least 90% gains and the natural place to turn to for such mercurial returns will be the biotech space. aTyr Pharma is an early-stage biotech which aims to turn unique biological pathways into novel medicines for better patient outcomes. The company is an expert in tRNA synthetase and NRP2 biology; the focus of its research is on the extracellular functionality and signaling mechanisms of tRNA synthetases. With more than 300 protein compositions patented, aTyr has established a global intellectual property estate directed to all 20 human tRNA synthetases and some associated signaling pathways. aTyr has several candidates in the early stages of development but the lead program is efzofitimod -- the first tRNA synthetase-derived and NRP2-targeting therapy. The company is working on efzofitimod as a potential disease-modifying treatment for patients with serious inflammatory lung diseases with high unmet medical need. This includes interstitial lung disease (ILD), a category of rare immune-mediated lung diseases that can lead to lung fibrosis. Pulmonary sarcoidosis - a common form of ILD - was chosen as the first clinical indication. In the United States, almost 200,000 people have pulmonary sarcoidosis, which accounts for more than 90% of all sarcoidosis cases. Efzofitimod has been designated orphan drug status for this indication. Following strong Phase 1b/2a data, encouraging feedback from the patients and physicians and a positive EoP2 meeting with the FDA, aTyr plans on initiating a pivotal trial in pulmonary sarcoidosis (PS) in 3Q22. The drug’s promise and the pipeline’s potential have piqued Oppenheimer’s Hartaj Singh’s interest. He writes: “Compelling Phase 1b/2a data, clinicians' positive attitude to the data, and a high unmet need give us conviction that the next pivotal trial could move faster than expected. We highlight management execution and believe there is more upside to the story… As we layer in other ILDs in 2022, we see upside. And this is not yet coupled with opportunities to expand into additional therapeutic areas like cancer.” Indeed, Singh sees “upside.” Backing his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating is a $21 price target, which suggests room for 295% growth over the coming year. (To watch Singh’s track record, click here) Four other analysts have chimed in with reviews recently and they are all positive, making the consensus view on this stock a Strong Buy. While not quite as optimistic as Singh’s objective, the $16.67 price target implies shares will still appreciate by a hefty 213% in the months ahead. (See LIFE stock forecast on TipRanks) Alpine Immune Sciences (ALPN) We won’t venture far a field for the next stock. Alpine Immune Sciences is a clinical stage biotech working on the discovery and development of innovative, protein-based immunotherapies. These target the immune synapse and are indicated for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders. The company’s pipeline has programs in various stages of development, some in partnership with others and some wholly owned. Of note is the Synergy study of Acazicolcept (ALPN-101), being developed in partnership with AbbVie with enrollment ongoing in the Phase 2 trial of patients with SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus). There’s also ALPN-303 – being developed for multiple autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. A Phase 1 study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of the drug in healthy volunteers began the enrollment process in 4Q21. The other program of note is for ALPN-202 (davoceticept) which is currently in two separate clinical trials – NEON-1, as a monotherapy to treat advanced malignancies and NEON-2, in combination with pembrolizumab also indicated for adults with advanced malignancies. The latter has encountered some issues recently. The FDA has put a partial clinical hold on the study following a patient’s death, attributed to cardiogenic shock, probably related to immune-mediated myocarditis. Given myocarditis is a known risk associated with PD-1 inhibitors, Oppenheimer’s Mark Breidenbach estimates pembrolizumab is the “more likely culprit in this case.” The analyst expects it will take between 3 to 6 months until enrollment for the study resumes. In the meantime, there are other catalysts to look forward to. “While Alpine is working to resolve a clinical hold on the NEON-2 trial, we expect to see updated dose-escalation data from NEON-1 at AACR, where we would view clean safety and evidence of dose-dependent activity in select tumor types as a win,” the analyst said. “By mid-year, we anticipate healthy volunteer data from ‘303, which could derisk Alpine’s plans to begin trials in SLE and additional autoantibody-related diseases in 2H. We believe Alpine is financed into early 2024, well beyond upcoming clinical catalysts.” To this end, Breidenbach gives ALPN shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating to go alongside a $17 price target. The implication for investors? Upside of ~95%. (To watch Breidenbach’s track record, click here) Looking at the consensus breakdown, 3 Buys and no Holds or Sells have been issued in the last three months. Therefore, ALPN gets a Strong Buy consensus rating. Based on the $19 average price target, shares could gain ~118% in the coming months.

3/24/2022,"undefinedundefined Can You Retire With $600,000? It's possible to retire with $600,000 in savings with careful planning, but it's important to consider how long your money will last. Whether you can successfully retire with $600,000 can depend on a number of factors, including: Your desired retirement age Estimated retirement budget Expected longevity Total savings and income The earlier you retire, the longer your retirement savings has to last, especially if you have a longer life expectancy. And the type of lifestyle you choose can influence how far $600,000 will go in retirement. Things like inflation and market volatility can also affect your overall retirement outcomes. Health can play a part as well as healthcare costs tend to increase as you get older. Can I Retire at 62 With $600,000? Retiring at 62 may be your goal, but can you do it with $600,000 in savings? If you plan to downsize your home, live a minimalist lifestyle and supplement your retirement savings with a pension plan, annuity or Social Security benefits then the answer may be yes. On the other hand, retiring at 62 with $600,000 may not be realistic if you plan to spend more to fund your lifestyle or you don't have alternative sources of income other than savings. While Social Security benefits can provide income, taking those benefits at 62 will reduce the amount you receive. You'll need to wait until full retirement age, typically 66 or 67, to get your full benefit amount. And you can increase your benefits if you're able to hold out until age 70. It's also important to consider overall health and how that can impact your retirement plans. If you manage to stay healthy and never need long-term care then $600,000 could be enough to sustain you in retirement. On the other hand, if you need long-term care in a nursing facility that could take a large bite out of your savings. Medicare doesn't cover extended nursing home care. Medicaid can but you may need to spend down the majority of your assets first to qualify. Setting up a Medicaid asset protection trust can allow you to get around this requirement, which may be something worth discussing with a financial advisor. How Long Will $600,000 Last in Retirement? undefined So let's apply that to a real-life example. Say that you plan to retire at 62 with $600,000 saved. You expect to withdraw 4% each year, starting with a $24,000 withdrawal in Year One. Your money earns a 5% annual rate of return while inflation stays at 2.9%. Based on those numbers, $600,000 would be enough to last you 30 years in retirement. In fact, by age 92 you'd still have over $116,000 in savings. Now, assume that inflation increases to 4%. In that scenario, you'd run out of money by age 90. This is important to understand because rising prices can reduce your purchasing power over time. This is where it becomes helpful to consider other sources of income for retirement, such as Social Security benefits or a pension if you have one. Again, Social Security benefits can begin as early as age 62, but you'll get a lower amount than you would if you waited until full retirement age. But if you're retiring with $600,000 in savings, taking benefits earlier could make sense if you're worried about running out of money based on your anticipated life expectancy. Using a Social Security retirement calculator can help you get a better idea of how much money you're likely to receive. How to Retire With $600,000 If you're interested in retiring with $600,000 in savings, planning early is important. You'll need to consider what age you plan to retire, what kind of lifestyle you anticipate having in retirement and what your total savings and income picture will look like. That includes planning for future income needs for your spouse as well if you're married. The earlier you begin saving, the easier it may be to reach your $600,000 goal. So if you have a 401(k) at work, for instance, you may want to focus on maxing that account out first. At the very least, it's important to save enough to qualify for the full employer match if there is one. If you don't have a 401(k), you can still save in an Individual Retirement Account. A traditional IRA can offer tax-deductible contributions, with taxes on earnings deferred until you retire. A Roth IRA offers no deduction but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. A SEP or SIMPLE IRA could make sense if you're self-employed. These accounts have higher annual contribution limits than traditional or Roth IRAs, so you can save more for the future. In terms of how withdrawals are taxed, they follow the same tax rules as traditional IRAs. You may also consider creating an additional stream of income for yourself with an annuity. An annuity is an insurance contract in which you pay a premium in exchange for receiving payments back later. There are different types of annuity products to choose from but they can all create guaranteed income. If you're married, you may be able to carry those benefits over to your spouse when you pass away. Talking to a financial advisor a can help you decide if an annuity might be right for you. Your advisor can also discuss other strategies that can help you reach your goal of saving $600,000 for retirement. For example, they can offer advice on how to best allocate your assets to generate your desired returns, both before and during retirement. They can also help you choose investments for maximum tax and cost-efficiency. The Bottom Line Retirement Planning Tips Consider talking to a financial advisor about what retiring on $600,000 might look like for you and whether that's something that's doable. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard.

3/24/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors in China Evergrande Group are still in the dark over just how $2.1 billion of deposits at its property-services unit came to be used as security for pledge guarantees and seized by banks. Most Read from Bloomberg Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time China Jet’s Nosedive From 29,000 Feet Baffles Crash Specialists China Plane Crash Update: One Black Box Located; Pilot Details Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Will Join NATO Summit Via Video Link In a call with investors late Tuesday, the developer’s officials reiterated comments from earlier filings that they were investigating the matter without sharing fresh details, according to people who attended and asked not to be identified. The third-party pledge guarantee wipes out most of Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd.’s cash holdings. “It’s peculiar because investors expect Evergrande management should be aware of where the cash went rather than instead setting up an investigation committee to find out,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Andrew Chan. While the 13.4 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) in seized cash is small in the context of the broader restructuring, it raises questions over the reliability of the financial accounts of the services unit “if the group plans to sell it at a good price to achieve maximum recovery for creditors,” Chan said.

Evergrande creditors are keeping a close eye on the beleaguered developer as it embarks on a debt restructuring that’s likely to be among China’s largest and most complex. Worries over transparency have surfaced repeatedly as Chinese developers struggle to cope with a credit crunch that’s swept the sector as Beijing clamps down on excessive borrowing.

3/24/2022,"For many homeowners, one of the milestones on the path to financial independence is being able to pay off their mortgage. With typical mortgages lasting 30 years, it can take a long time to meet this goal. But what happens when you pay off your mortgage? There are, in fact, a number of steps to making your final mortgage payment and figuring out what to do next. Consider working with a financial advisor as you work toward your financial goals and overall independence. How to Pay off a Mortgage When you're ready to pay off your mortgage, follow these steps to accomplish your goal. Keep in mind that because of accrued interest, the balance on your mortgage statement isn't the payoff amount. Contact your lender online or over the phone to request a payoff statement. The mortgage company will send you a letter with a payoff amount through a specific date. This amount includes accrued interest through a certain date. Pay the amount due by the due date or expiration of the payoff statement to eliminate your mortgage. Any excess amount that you pay will be refunded. Since most mortgages have property taxes and homeowners insurance premiums included in the monthly payment, there will be an amount leftover when your mortgage is paid off. Request an escrow account refund and set that money aside to pay those bills when they come due. What Happens When You Pay off Your Mortgage? Once your final payment is made, there are certain actions that the mortgage company and you should make to formalize this milestone. Receive mortgage documents: The mortgage company will send you a canceled promissory note, updated deed of trust and certificate of satisfaction. These documents prove that your mortgage is paid off. Save them in a secure location. Stop automatic payments to your mortgage company: Ensure that any automatic payments you've established have been canceled. With your mortgage paid off, you do not have to send the mortgage company any more money. Send discharge of mortgage letter to your county: Your mortgage company should send all of the required documents to your county clerk's office notifying them that your home is no longer bound by a mortgage. If they have not within 90 days, bring your mortgage documents to the clerk to update their records. Notify your insurance company: Contact your insurance company to let them know that your mortgage has been paid off. They may require a copy of your mortgage documents to verify that this is true. Celebrate this milestone: This is a momentous occasion, so take the time to celebrate it with your significant other, family and friends. Managing the Ongoing Expenses of Your Home Even though your mortgage is paid off, that doesn't mean that you no longer have any house expenses. It is a good idea to set aside savings accounts for each of these ongoing expenses. Property taxes are typically a portion of the value of your home and are paid near the end of the year. Assuming that your home continues to increase in value, this bill will also increase each year. This bill varies based on the type of home you have, coverages and deductibles selected, recent claims and other factors. While you can pay monthly, you'll often save money by paying it once a year. Some homes are in communities with homeowners associations that charge dues. These dues are often monthly or quarterly. It is recommended that you set aside 1% of your home's value for repairs and maintenance. Even if you don't spend that much each year, you'll need the excess for bigger projects. These could include things like replacing a roof or painting your home. Styles and tastes vary over the years, so you may want to set aside money to pay for larger projects, like updating bathrooms, remodeling the kitchen and replacing windows. What You Can Do With Your Extra Money When you pay off your mortgage, you'll suddenly find yourself with more money each month. Depending on your financial plan, some or all of these steps may be useful: Focus on paying off debts: If you have other debts, ""snowballing"" your mortgage payment towards the next debt can accelerate its payoff. Build your emergency fund: Experts recommend having an emergency fund that is three to six months of your monthly expenses. The good news is that the number is much smaller now that you've eliminated your mortgage payment. Max out your retirement plans: If you're not doing so already, putting extra money towards maxing out your company retirement plan and traditional or Roth IRA is a great idea. This is especially true for investors 50 and over who have access to ""catch-up"" provisions. Invest in a brokerage account: When your retirement accounts are set, investing in a brokerage account enables you to invest without locking up your money until you reach retirement age. Increase your insurance coverage: Many homeowners do not have adequate life, long-term care or disability insurance coverage. Speak with a financial advisor to determine what number you need to meet your goals. Contribute to college savings accounts: If you have kids or grandkids, helping them out with their college expenses may be a goal of yours. Contributing to a Coverdale Savings Account or 529 plan is a good way for that money to grow tax-free for education. Strategies for Paying off Your Mortgage Quickly Most homeowners make all of their payments according to the mortgage schedule. But there are other ways that you can accelerate the payoff of your mortgage ahead of schedule. Bi-weekly payments: Bi-weekly payments allow you to pay half your mortgage payment every two weeks instead of once a month. This also makes it so you pay one extra payment each year, which shaves off about four years from the standard 30-year mortgage. Lump sum payments: In addition to making the normal monthly payment, some homeowners pay extra when they can. Examples include tax refunds, annual bonuses, inheritances and other unexpected windfalls. Rounding up payments: By rounding up your mortgage payment to the next $100 (or more), you'll be paying extra towards the principal of your mortgage every month. Most homeowners won't miss the additional payment out of their monthly budget. Mortgage payoff fund: Instead of paying extra towards your mortgage, you can set up an investment account dedicated to your mortgage. You'll add extra money to this account to earn stock market returns – provided those returns exceed your mortgage interest rate. At some point in the future, you can cash out this account and pay off your mortgage if you'd like. Bottom Line Paying off your mortgage is a goal that many homeowners dream of. When you pay it off, there are certain steps you should take to formalize it. Additionally, now that your mortgage is gone, you'll have extra money to use on your other goals. But, you also need to set aside money for ongoing expenses, like property taxes and insurance. Tips for Paying off Your Mortgage Financial advisors can recommend investments that reduce taxes and earn higher returns so that you have more money to pay off your mortgage. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

3/24/2022,"Residential rental properties have been the most common investment option for most people wanting to build wealth through real estate investing. A modest savings account could cover the down payment on a single-family home in many parts of the country, and an ambitious investor could scale that first purchase into a multi-million dollar portfolio. Institutional investors mostly stayed out of the single-family housing market. Hedge funds and private equity firms historically maintained their focus on commercial real estate and large multifamily properties, leaving retail investors to dominate the rental property space. The dynamic has been slowly shifting in the residential real estate market since the Great Recession in 2008, but this shift has been accelerating over the past couple of years. Seeing the major growth potential in new markets because of shifting migration trends and a growing need for affordable housing, many institutional investors are aiming their focus on single-family rentals. According to Redfin, single-family homes represented 74.4% of real estate investor purchases in the third quarter of 2021, the highest level on record. Who’s Buying The Most Single-Family Rentals? One of the largest players in the single-family rental market is Pretium Partners, an investment management firm founded by Don Mullen Jr., the Goldman executive that bet against the housing market in 2008. The firm has a portfolio of nearly 80,000 homes across 30 markets. Mullen described his firm’s real estate strategy as a way to capitalize on the millennial generation being priced out of the housing market in a video posted on the company’s website. The current leader in the single-family rental space is the publicly traded REIT Invitation Homes (NYSE: INVH). The company currently has a portfolio of over 80,000 homes focused on the Western United States, the Southeast, Texas and Florida. In 2021, Invitation Homes grew its portfolio by over 4,000 homes after adding roughly 1,000 properties in 2020. J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) Asset Management entered into a joint venture with the single-family rental home company American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH) in 2020 that is now building thousands of homes with its build-to-rent model. What This Means for Individual Investors The institutional investors gaining a larger share of the rental property market are making it difficult for new individual investors to compete. The sheer scale of the growing institutional single-family rental portfolios allows these companies to reduce operating costs and provide more affordable rental rates than individual investors can while maintaining strong margins. Companies like Invitation Homes and Pretium Partners also have access to much cheaper debt than the average investor, bringing down their total cost of ownership. A few companies with a growing market share are actually offering new ways for individuals to invest in single-family rentals instead of forcing them out of the market. Provident Realty Advisors recently launched an offering on CrowdStreet for the development of seven build-to-rent communities in Texas, which offers investors a target internal rate of return (IRR) of 18% to 22% over the target hold period. One of the newest players in the space is the Jeff Bezos-backed real estate investment platform Arrived Homes. The company has been acquiring rental properties across several markets and allowing investors to buy equity shares of the individual properties through Regulation A offerings with as little as $100. What This Means for the Real Estate Market Moving Forward Investors, both institutional and individual, have captured a much larger share of the total single-family housing market since the crash in 2008, which might offer the market an added layer of protection. Properties that are part of an institutional portfolio will be less likely to go into foreclosure in the event of another economic recession. These same investors are also likely to take advantage of more opportunistic buying opportunities if another recession results in a higher foreclosure rate among owner-occupied homes, slowing the supply of new homes hitting the market. Overall, the changing dynamic could mean a new opportunity for individual investors that want access to passive real estate investments.
