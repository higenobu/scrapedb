12/15/2021,"TOKYO (Reuters) -The Japanese government overstated construction orders data received from the industry for years, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday, in a practice that may have had the effect of inflating the country's economic growth figures. Kishida made the comment in a parliamentary session after an Asahi newspaper report that the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism had been ""rewriting"" data received from about 12,000 select companies since 2013 at a pace of about 10,000 entries per year. It was not clear why the government started the practice of rewriting the data. It is also unclear how gross domestic product (GDP) figures may have been affected, though analysts expected any impact to be minimal particularly as the companies concerned were likely small in scale. ""It is regrettable that such a thing has happened,"" Kishida said. ""The government will examine as soon as possible what steps it can take to avoid such an incident from happening again."" He added that ""improvements"" had been made to the figures since January 2020 and that there was no direct impact on GDP data for fiscal year 2020 and 2021. More broadly, the concern for some is the credibility of data upon which market participants rely for forecasting. ""The biggest problem is not the effect on the GDP per se but the damage to reliability of (official) statistics,"" said Saisuke Sakai, senior economist at Mizuho Research and Technologies. ""We can't help doubting this kind of issue could happen across government ministries,"" Sakai added, referring to another flaw in health ministry data found in 2018. SLOPPY The survey compiles public and private construction orders which in the 2020 fiscal year totalled roughly 80 trillion yen ($700 billion), and is among data used to calculate GDP. For the survey, the ministry collects monthly orders data from construction companies through local prefecture authorities. Companies that were late in submitting orders data would often send in several months' worth of figures at once at a later date, the Asahi said. In these instances, the ministry would instruct local authorities to rewrite the orders for the combined months as the figure for the latest, single month. ""This won't give much of a boost (to construction orders data). Overall GDP data is unlikely to change,"" said Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. Considering Japan has hundreds of thousands of construction companies, the ratio of those concerned is very small, he said. ""How much influence do they have? The kind of sloppy company - which puts out numbers late - is probably not a big one."" Land Minister Tetsuo Saito, member of the Komeito party - the junior partner of the ruling coalition - confirmed the practice in parliament, calling it ""extremely regrettable"". Asked about the issue, the government's top spokesperson said only that the land ministry had been instructed to analyse ""as soon as possible"" what led to the practice. ""We will first wait for the results of that investigation,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference when asked whether past GDP figures, the government's monthly economic report, or other data may need to be revised. The rewriting of the data, which may be in breach of law, continued until this March, the Asahi said.

12/15/2021,"Christopher Trogan, a professor in the English department at the University of Fordham, was fired after confusing the names of two Black students in his class, in what he called an “innocent mistake,” according to The Observer. The two students whose names were confused sent an email to Trogan, voicing how disrespected they felt. They also believed the confusion occurred because both students were Black.

 He referred to the name mix-up as an “innocent mistake” and said he had a “confused brain” because the two students arrived late while he was reading the work of another student at the lecturer podium. “The offended student assumed my mistake was because I confused that student with another Black student,” Trogan said in his email to students. “I have done my best to validate and reassure the offended student that I made a simple, human, error. It has nothing to do with race.” One of the first-year students who was involved in the name mix-up incident said their experience in Trogan’s class prior to the incident was not great. The student, who asked to remain anonymous due to privacy concerns, told The Observer that Trogan repeatedly got their name incorrect over the course of four classes. “I felt really disrespected,” they said. “I did not feel heard because every time he (misnamed me) I would tell him, and it just seemed like he would brush it off or that he did not care.” I don’t mean to generalize, but I think most Black people have been called another name by ... their own mother . I am not saying the students are wrong. I am just saying this is not a straightforward case.
 Trogan himself asked students to share any problems or complaints they have had with him to the Dean of Fordham College at Lincoln Center and other administrators per the report from The Observer. The other student involved in the name confusion was Chantel Sims, and she felt that a lot of what Trogan voiced in the email to students was irrelevant and did not need to be in the email he sent to students. From The Observer: “It seemed a little excessive, like all you needed to do, was say sorry and it would have been fine,” she said. “We were not actually that upset about him mixing up our names. It was more so the random things he would throw into the response.” In the email to students, Trogan assured students the course was “centered specifically and explicitly around issues of justice, equality, and inclusion,” and that he has devoted his “entire life” to these issues — describing his dedication to racial justice throughout his career in depth. Sims said the section of the email that listed his credentials and “everything he has done for minorities” gave her the impression of a white savior complex. The other first-year student interviewed by The Observer agreed with this assessment. What do you think?

12/15/2021,"Over 37 million Americans are living with kidney disease, also known as renal disease, a progressive condition that causes a gradual loss of normal kidney function over time. However, experts warn that the vast majority of those with the condition are unaware of their diagnosis. In fact, according to Joseph Vassalotti, MD, Chief Medical Officer at the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), just ""10 percent of people with chronic kidney disease know that they have it."" That's because symptoms tend to become apparent in the later stages of the disease, when it is most difficult to treat. Making matters worse, many of the symptoms that do ultimately appear are attributed to other conditions, per the NKF. That's why it's so crucial to know what to look for when it comes to renal disease. The sooner you spot symptoms, the sooner you can slow the progression of damage to your kidneys. Read on to find out which surprising kidney symptom may occur in your fingers, and why you should always tell a doctor if you notice it. RELATED: If You Drink This Beverage Often, Get Your Kidneys Checked, New Study Says. When your fingers become swollen, it typically means that your body is retaining fluid. One possible underlying cause is renal disease. According to the NKF, ""the kidneys filter wastes from the blood and remove excess water from the body via urine. When the kidneys aren't doing their job, this fluid can stay in the system instead of being excreted."" This can lead to swelling in the joints, a kidney symptom that the organization says ""shouldn't be dismissed."" Additionally, the NKF notes that ""decreased kidney function can lead to sodium retention,"" another cause for swelling. ""Sodium accumulation is one of the consequences of renal failure, resulting in increased water intake, increases in the extracellular volume, and accompanying rise in blood pressure,"" says a 2010 study on the matter. RELATED: If You Notice This on Your Face, Have Your Kidneys Checked. While swelling in the fingers and hands is considered typical of late-stage renal disease, this same swelling is characteristic of heart disease, which the NKF notes often occurs simultaneously in patients. ""If you have heart disease, it is likely that you have kidney disease and vice-versa. Many people don't experience severe symptoms until their kidney or heart disease is quite advanced,"" the organization writes. That's why if you notice swelling, it may be linked to both causes at once—and you should speak with your doctor about both possibilities. ""Swelling around the hands, feet, and ankles may be associated with kidney or heart failure,"" write NKF experts. They add that kidney failure and heart failure often occur in tandem because ""CKD [chronic kidney disease] is linked with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar (diabetes), all of which can increase the risk of heart disease."" Symptoms of kidney disease typically only appear when the condition reaches an advanced stage, meaning it's time to take immediate action if you believe you're showing signs of kidney-related illness. According to the Mayo Clinic, those with chronic kidney disease may experience nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, changes in the frequency of urination, muscle cramps, dry or itchy skin, high blood pressure, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The NKF adds that you may also notice protein or blood in your urine, or your urine may appear foamy. If your swelling is accompanied by any of these symptoms, ask your doctor whether a kidney screening is right for you.

Though sudden swelling can be linked to chronic kidney disease or renal failure, it can also have a range of other underlying causes—many of them more benign. For instance, your swollen fingers may be the result of a salty meal causing sodium retention unrelated to a kidney condition, or your blood vessels reacting to heat, according to WebMD. These are both considered normal reactions, and should subside within hours. Swelling can also be the result of injury or infection, either of which may require medical attention. If symptoms persist over time, it could be something more serious, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lymphedema. Speak with your doctor to discuss the full range of possible underlying causes if your symptoms don't resolve on their own.
