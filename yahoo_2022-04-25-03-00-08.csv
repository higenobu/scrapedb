4/25/2022,"A former federal prosecutor said Donald Trump and Mark Meadows ""wanted the Capitol to be taken."" Ex-prosecutor Glenn Kirschner based his analysis on new testimony given to Capitol riot investigators. The testimony revealed Trump and Meadows plotted with Republican reps to overturn Biden's victory. Former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner believes former President Donald Trump and his former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows ""wanted the Capitol to be taken"" on the day of the insurrection last year. ""Donald Trump, Mark Meadows, and others in Donald Trump's administration deprived the Capitol of the federal law enforcement forces it needed to defend itself,"" Kirschner said in a video posted to YouTube on Friday. ""And that, friends, leads to one pretty compelling inference. We can maybe even call it the only reasonable conclusion: That Donald Trump and Mark Meadows wanted the Capitol to be taken; that Donald Trump and Mark Meadows the angry mob to stop the certification of Joe Biden's win."" Kirschner's remarks come after testimony given to the House panel tasked with investigating the Capitol riot revealed that Meadows plotted with Republican lawmakers to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. In December 2020, Reps. Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, and other Republican lawmakers participated in calls and meetings with Trump and his aides after he lost the 2020 presidential election, according to testimony given to the committee by Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to Meadows. Hutchinson said in the deposition records that various Republican lawmakers, including Gaetz, Jordan, Reps. Scott Perry, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Louis Gohmert, either met in person or dialed into meetings discussing ways to undo Biden's victory. During these meetings, the Republican lawmakers explored avenues that ""could potentially be a constitutional and viable option to either stall certification of the election or to delay the inauguration or to assert that Mr. Trump had actually won,"" Hutchinson said. The testimony helps shed light on Trump and Meadows' intentions, Kirschner said. Previously, Kirschner said the testimony is ""certainly incriminating"" of Trump. Other political figures agree the testimony so far has been shocking. For instance, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who serves on the Jan. 6 House panel, said the testimony brought forth before the panel will ""really blow the roof off the House.""

4/25/2022,"Russian forces tried to storm a steel plant sheltering soldiers and civilians in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Saturday. The attack on Mariupol, the biggest battle of the conflict, has raged for weeks. Capturing the city is seen as vital to Russia's attempts to link the eastern Donbas region with Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Moscow seized in 2014. Here's what happened overnight – and you can follow the latest updates in our live blog. Russia resumed its assault on the last defenders in a giant steel works in Mariupol, a Ukrainian official said, days after Moscow declared victory in the southern port city and said its forces did not need to take the factory. Meanwhile, a new attempt to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from war-torn Mariupol failed, an aide to the city's mayor said, blaming Russian forces. The official said 200 residents of Mariupol had gathered to be evacuated but the Russian military told them to disperse and warned of possible shelling. A mother and her baby daughter have been identified as two of the people killed by Russian missiles which hit a residential building in Odesa on Saturday. Valeria Glodan and three-month old Kira were among eight people who died when Russian rockets hit buildings in the Black Sea Port city. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will visit Kyiv on Sunday, the highest American delegation since the beginning of the war. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who announced the visit, also issued a new call for a meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin ""to end the war"". Volodymyr Zelensky criticised a decision by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to visit Moscow on Tuesday, instead of travelling first to Kyiv. Mr Guterres will meet Mr Zelensky on Thursday, but the Ukrainian leader said there is ""no justice and no logic"" in his visiting Russia first. A third of Russian gas exported to the European Union could be affected because of the war, said the head of Ukraine's state gas company Naftogaz. ""We estimate a third of the gas exported from Russia to the European Union via Ukraine will be lost if the [Russian] forces of occupation don't stop disrupting the working of the stations in the recently occupied territories,"" Yuriy Vitrenko wrote on Twitter. President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a new call Saturday for a meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin ""to end the war."" ""I think that whoever started this war will be able to end it,"" Mr Zelensky said, adding he was ""not afraid"" to meet the Russian leader, who attended an Orthodox Easter service in Moscow. But he again stressed that Kyiv would abandon talks with Moscow if its troops in Mariupol were killed.

4/25/2022,"CrossFit star Kari Pearce said intense, non-traditional exercises help build abs better than crunches. Her favorite underrated core moves include hanging leg raises with weight and hollow holds. Pearce also loves high-intensity burpees to burn calories and body fat, the key to visible abs. If you're looking for strong, defined core muscles, crunches just aren't going to cut it, according to Kari Pearce, a former elite gymnast and six-time CrossFit Games athlete. ""I definitely think crunches are an overrated exercise because people aren't learning how to properly activate their core,"" she told Insider. Pearce is an expert in core strength and stability, able to rep out hundreds of weighted pull-ups and excelling in skill and strength exercises like handstand push-ups. Now retired from competitive CrossFit, her PowerAbs and other workout programs help athletes of all sports and experience levels work toward the coveted six-pack aesthetic. She said high-intensity exercises like hanging leg raises, hollow holds, and burpees are key for building muscle and burning fat to sculpt defined abs. Ab training shouldn't be painful or boring if you're doing it correctly — if your lower back aches, you're likely not engaging your core correctly, which is ineffective and may lead to injury, according to Pearce. You also don't need to overdo it with a workout, as consistently training 10 minutes a day is enough to notice a difference, she said. ""If you have fun, you're more likely to do it. You don't have to work out for hours,"" Pearce said. ""If you hit it and hit it hard, you'll have great results."" For athletes seeking a challenge, Pearce said one of her all-time favorite ab exercises is a hanging leg raise, with added weight. Start by positioning a medicine ball or dumbbell between your feet. Grab onto a sturdy pull-up bar into a dead hang, holding the weight pressed between your feet or lower legs. Slowly, with control, raise your legs parallel to the floor, so your body makes an L shape, and slowly lower. To modify, you can try a hanging knee tuck with weight, bringing your knees to your chest instead of extending your legs out straight. If the exercise is too challenging, drop the weight, since even your bodyweight will provide enough resistance to feel the burn — other physique athletes, like bodybuilder Dr. Sunny Andrews, swear by unweighted hanging leg raises for six-pack abs. Pearce also likes to incorporate everyone's favorite love-to-hate exercise, the burpee. ""Burpees are one of the best movements for working your abs to make them pop,"" she said. Burpee variations not only work core muscles like abs and glutes, but are high-intensity and involve multiple muscle groups to maximize calorie burn, which Pearce said is key if you want visible abs. ""One of the biggest misconceptions is thinking ab exercise is just going to melt stomach fat. We can build the muscles underneath and strengthen them, but they won't show without losing body fat,"" she said. One of the most effective, underrated core exercises is also one of the simplest, Pearce said. The hollow body hold involves lying on the ground and pressing your lower back into the floor to raise your legs and shoulders with arms extended overhead, which is deceptively challenging. A perfect hollow hold allows you to maintain tension and stability in a variety of other exercises to work your core more effectively. ""They're very hard, but they're the foundation for V-ups, tuck-ups, and bicycles,"" Pearce said. Beginners can start with variations like the dead bug and other scaled exercises to build up strength.
