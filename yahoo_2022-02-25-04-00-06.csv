2/25/2022,"An international relations expert is warning that the attacks on Ukraine by Russian forces will lead to dire consequences unless the leaders of other nations change how they deal with Russia - and that includes Canada. Russia is in the midst of invading Ukraine from land, sea and air, zeroing in on cities and military targets. Aurel Braun is a professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto, as well as an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Harvard University. He says so far, leaders in countries like the U.S. have used tactics that are too soft, which is why Russia is escalating its presence in the Ukraine. Unless we change our collective approach to Russia, we’re not going to be able to stop this. It’s likely to get worse. Not because Putin is some mad aggressor who wants to conquer countries all over the world, but because he’s an opportunist who will take whatever he can if he finds weakness.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto It appears sanctions against Russia haven’t been enough. Braun says the lack of defence armament from other countries makes Ukraine a soft target. Meanwhile, diplomacy talks with the US have only appeared to make Putin more emboldened. Ukrainians are fleeing the capital, Kyiv, as President Volodymyr Zelensky declares martial law in response to Russia's attack on multiple targets in the country. Domestically, Canada is close to Ukraine because of the large diaspora that live here. When it comes to our role in the current situation, Canada has sent $7.8 million for lethal military equipment, which Braun says would add up to roughly three hours of ammunition. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a first round of sanctions against Russia and more troops have been sent to Europe. About 400 Canadian troops have been stationed in Latvia for the last several years, which Braun says puts Canada closer to the frontlines. If Mr. Putin decides to attack Latvia, Canadians soldiers will die, it’s that basic,” he says. “This is very real for Canada. We’re not bystanders.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto Another thing to consider is Canada’s geographical position across the Atlantic Ocean from Russia. The Arctic has become an important and contested area, thanks to its vast natural resources – 20 to 30 per cent of the world’s hydrocarbons are there. It's also an incredibly fragile ecological area, so that if an accident were to occur there, it would be catastrophic. Though Canada has banned any exploration in most areas of the Arctic, Russia has moved full steam ahead with exploration, since 60 per cent of their exports are hydrocarbons. “They’re not restrained by the Glasgow or Paris Agreements,” says Braun. “They’ve paid lip service to it, but in reality they’ve disregarded it...any accident would have horrific effects to the Canadian Arctic coastline.” Russia has militarized the Arctic since it’s becoming more of a strategic area for them, which directly affects Canada. “If we don’t deter Russia, Canada’s is going to be affected directly,” Braun says. “Materially, ecologically, and strategically.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,"'If we don’t deter Russia, Canada is going to be affected directly': Attacks on Ukraine could threaten security of Canada",https://news.yahoo.com/canada-russia-ukraine-war-impact-arctic-security-172703258.html

Ciaya Whetstone, 21, arrived at the hospital just before 7 a.m. Saturday ""via private conveyance,"" according to a police statement. She was pronounced dead a short time later. ""The incident remains under investigation as an unclassified death,"" police said. Hours before her death, Whetstone had attended the Carnival parades in Metairie, her friends told The Times-Picayune. The University of New Orleans student then went to a few bars with her friends before another friend brought her back to her boyfriend's house, according to the newspaper. Early Saturday morning, Whetstone caught an Uber ride to her apartment so she could check on her dog, the newspaper reported. Her roommate said the Uber driver waited there because Whetstone said she wanted to go ""and find her car."" ""I tried to convince her not to go,” the roommate, Reese White, said. Police have not said who dropped Whetstone off at the hospital. Uber said the driver's account has been deactivated and they launched their own investigation. “Our thoughts are with Ciaya Whetstone’s family as they grieve the loss of their daughter. We stand ready to assist law enforcement with their investigation,"" a spokesperson said. Whetstone was a junior business administration major at the University of New Orleans.

2/25/2022,"A legislative push in Tennessee to ban “obscene” books from schools resulted in a surreal hearing on Wednesday, with country music star John Rich arguing that librarians and teachers pose a greater threat to children than actual pedophiles. Rich is one half of the duo “Big & Rich.” The band’s 2004 hit “Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy)” encourages listeners to “give a dang about nothing” and drink heavily, while celebrating women who “save” horses by instead riding cowboys. “What’s the difference between a teacher, educator or librarian putting one of these books like you have on the desk of a student, or a guy in a white van pulling up at the edge of school when school lets out and saying, ‘Come on around kids, let me read you this book and show you these pictures?’” Rich asked legislators in Nashville. “What’s the difference in those two scenarios? There is a difference, by the way: They can run away from the guy in the white van.” Y’all —- Today at the TN legislature, testifying for @CepickyTn64’s pro-censorship bill, singer @johnrich accused schools/librarians of “grooming” kids because there some library books may discuss sexual content.

(Reminder: His big hit was “Save a Horse, Ride A Cowboy” 🤷🏻‍♂️) pic.twitter.com/KTVIiLoCxm — The Tennessee Holler (@TheTNHoller) February 24, 2022 In a follow-up tweet, Rich likened himself to “the firewall between tyranny and freedom” and said his testimony was “going toe to toe with adversaries.” The measure in question, HB 1944, would prohibit public and charter schools from “making obscene materials or materials harmful to minors” available to students. Notably, the bill does not define what would qualify as “obscene.” Its sponsor, state Rep. Scott Cepicky (R), introduced the bill in January in a show of support for the McMinn County Board of Education’s decision to ban a book about the Holocaust. The board banned the Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel “Maus” from the eighth-grade curriculum, due to concerns about “objectionable language” and nudity in its cartoon depictions of the Holocaust.

2/25/2022,"A retired police SWAT commander testified Thursday that he fatally shot a man in a movie theater eight years ago during an argument sparked by cellphone usage and escalated by a thrown popcorn bag because he feared he was about to be attacked by a person he said was “out of control"" and “looked like a monster.” Curtis Reeves, a 79-year-old former Tampa police captain, said he shot 43-year-old Chad Oulson on Jan. 13, 2014, because the younger, fitter man was cursing at him and about to attack him because he had complained about Oulsen's cellphone use during previews. Testifying in Pasco County, north of Tampa, Reeves said he fired his .380 handgun because he believed he had no other choice, saying his seated position, his then-71 years and his poor health made it impossible to defend himself with his hands. “He was so much above me and so full of rage ... that he was going to strike me with all the strength that he could put together. I figured this was the end of the line for me,” said Reeves, who had been hit by his own popcorn bag, which Oulson had grabbed from his lap and tossed back at him. He faces a potential life sentence if convicted of second-degree murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Oulson's widow, Nicole Oulson, glared at Reeves throughout his testimony, rocking slightly back and forth. Her finger nearly severed by the bullet that killed her husband as she tried to get him to sit down, she testified earlier she never heard him curse at Reeves. She said Reeves had started the argument by ordering her husband put away his cellphone as he checked on their 22-month-old daughter at daycare. Another witness testified that after firing the shot, Reeves had muttered, “throw popcorn in my face.” His defense invoked Florida’s “stand your ground” law that allows use of deadly force in the face of mortal danger or fear of serious injury, but that was rejected by Circuit Judge Susan Barthle. Since the shooting, Reeves has mostly been on house arrest as his attorneys’ arguments and the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the trial. Under questioning by his attorney Richard Escobar, Reeves testified Thursday that he and his wife, Vivian, had arrived early to see the Afghan War movie “Lone Survivor,” sitting in the back row in the middle. Their son, now a Tampa police officer, was supposed to meet them. The Oulsons were sitting one row in front of them, slightly to Reeves' right. Dressed in a gray suit and speaking in a clear, calm voice, Reeves said as the previews began, he asked Oulson politely to put down his cellphone because it was shining in his eyes. He said Oulson cursed at him and refused. Turning periodically to face the jury, as police officers are trained to do when testifying, Reeves said he was not angry, but decided to head to the lobby and report Oulson to the manager. After he returned to his seat, he said Oulson glared at him and seemed to be speaking loudly to his wife or the audience in general. Reeves said he tried to “diffuse the situation” by telling Oulson that if he had known he would put his phone away, he would not have gone to the manager. He said he turned away, but when he looked back Oulson had stood up, he saw a reflection and his vision went fuzzy as something hit him in the glasses, knocking them askew. He didn't think Oulson was close enough to reach him — he said Oulson threw his cellphone, which was found on the floor near Reeves. Reeves said Oulson was standing over him, “yelling a lot of profanities and threats."" “The F-word seemed to be his primary vocabulary,” using the word as part of a threat to beat him, Reeves said. “He is very volatile and active. He is trying to come over the seats. “I am looking up at this guy and looked like a monster,” Reeves said. He said Nicole Oulson appeared to be trying to hold her husband back, but Chad Oulson appeared ready to strike. “I was completely defenseless,” Reeves said. “I have never encountered someone exhibiting that amount of uncontrolled anger and rage.” He pulled his gun from his pocket and fired once, striking Oulson in the chest. He died in the theater. Sheriff's deputies arrived and arrested Reeves. Reeves appeared less confident under cross-examination by prosecutor Scott Rosenwasser, often struggling to understand and answer the questions. Rosenwasser repeatedly tried to show Reeves was not as debilitated as he claimed, pointing out that shortly before the shooting he had gone on an archery hunting trip where he had to walk uphill and climb 10 feet (3 meters) up a tree to enter a stand. He also got Reeves to concede that someone cannot shoot another person who had simply thrown a harmless item at them and that he had rejected his wife's suggestion that they move away from the Oulsons. Rosenwasser spent significant time with Reeves going through security video of the shooting, trying to show that the reflection Reeves saw just before shooting was light bouncing off reflective material on his own shoe. He told Reeves there was no indication on the video that Oulson threw his cellphone at Reeves, who responded that he did. “No one can answer that but me,” Reeves said.",U.S./Associated Press,Retired officer says he had no choice in theater killing,https://news.yahoo.com/retired-officer-says-had-no-172835694.html
