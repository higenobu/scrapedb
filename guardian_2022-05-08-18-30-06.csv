5/8/2022,"Labour has rejected claims that a leaked planning memo about Keir Starmer’s visit to Durham last year undermined his assertion he did not break lockdown rules. The Labour document, published by the Mail on Sunday, shows that an 80-minute dinner with the Labour MP Mary Foy, featuring a takeaway curry, was planned as part of his schedule. Starmer has repeatedly claimed that the meal, at which he was pictured drinking beer, did not break lockdown rules because he was eating in the course of work, and not attending a social event. The announcement by Durham police on Friday that they were reopening their investigation into the event has led Tories to accuse the Labour leader of hypocrisy as he called for Boris Johnson’s resignation when police opened an investigation into lockdown breaches at No 10. Tories argued the memo was evidence the meal was in breach of lockdown rules because it showed that it was pre-arranged (to take place between 8.40pm and 10pm) and not just a spontaneous decision to order food as work extended into the evening, as Starmer’s account of the evening has implied. Starmer has also claimed that after his meal he continued working. But the leaked schedule showed that, 10pm after the meal, he was due to return to his hotel. In a separate report, the Sunday Times quoted an unnamed source who was present at the gathering saying that Starmer did not return to work after his meal and that Foy and her staff were not present for work purposes, but just for a drink. “Mary Foy and her staff were not working and I have not got a problem telling that to the police. They were just getting pissed. They were just there for a jolly,” the source told the paper. Mary Foy said: “Me and my team were working during a very busy period. Including facilitating the leader’s visit. I do not believe either I or my office broke any rules and I will of course fully engage with any police investigation.” In a tweet at the weekend, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, claimed the memo showed that Labour’s account of the evening was “a lie”. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, told Sky’s Sophie Ridge on Sunday, that Starmer was guilty of “rank double standards”. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, told the same programme that the leaked memo confirmed Starmer was on a work visit when he was in Durham on 30 April 2020. She said Starmer was the victim of “an absolutely desperate attempt to sling mud” and that it was “absurd” to equate this with a prime minister under investigation for 12 separate gatherings, including “karaoke parties, bring your own bottle parties, pub quizzes [and] suitcases full of wine being smuggled through the back door”. She continued: “The prime minister lied about that … Keir Starmer went on a work visit and had a break to eat. The idea that this is the same sort of thing is just a sign of a government that is tired, and is desperate and is completely out of ideas.” A spokesperson for Starmer’s office said: “Keir was working, a takeaway was made available in the kitchen, and he ate between work demands. No rules were broken.” Timings for events frequently slip during a campaign and on the day of the curry the takeaway was late, a source said. Adam Wagner, a barrister and a specialist in lockdown rules, posted a message on Twitter saying that the fact that Starmer’s meal was pre-planned did not undermine claims it was necessary for work reasons. “The fact it was pre-arranged with social distancing guidelines makes it more likely to be reasonably necessary not less,” he said. He also argued that the event was analagous to the Downing Street gathering where Johnson and his staff were photographed drinking wine and eating cheese in the No 10 garden where they were said to be discussing work matters. That event was not investigated by the Metropolitan police, Wagner pointed out.",News/Politics,Labour denies leaked memo shows Starmer broke lockdown rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/08/labour-denies-leaked-memo-shows-starmer-broke-lockdown-rules
5/8/2022,"This month, my parents and their friends in central Italy are busy singing folk songs with fellow May singers called maggerini. Traditionally, workers would gather on 1 May, Labour Day, and sing at farms in the locality in exchange for farm produce: salami, cheese, vegetables, eggs, ricotta, poultry, nuts, dried fruits – a bounty by anyone’s standards. In the postwar period, it became linked with the Partisans and resistance to Fascism. To this day, the maggerini rewrite verses to update popular songs with current issues – you can imagine what the subjects are this year. Today, a week later, is La Ribotta, when the singers gather and eat what they were given the week before. It is a spectacular feast and the recipes below are an homage to that celebration. When I went, it was a bit like living in an Asterix comic. I think the Abruzzese dish, Le Virtù, demonstrates the Italian reverence for seasonal produce – each vegetable given the spotlight in a careful cooking. We will take the trouble and enjoy celebrating simple things this season. If I had small fresh, crunchy broad beans I’d be tempted to eat them raw. It’s worth hanging on, though, and the breadcrumbs will provide the crunch you lose on cooking them. Serves 4 bread 2 slicesolive oilgarlic ½ clovedried chilli 1vinegar 100mlfresh broad beans 300g (shelled weight)salami 1, smallpecorino 300g Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Blitz the bread to crumbs, drench with olive oil and roast for 5 minutes, or until crisp. Set aside on a paper towel until needed. Slice the garlic as thinly as possible. Place in a small pot with 4 generous tbsp of olive oil and the dried chilli, and fry from cold on a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to get sticky, turn off the heat and set aside. Bring a small pot to the boil with the vinegar and roughly 4 times as much water. Boil the broad beans for 3 minutes, before removing them with a slotted spoon to the garlic and oil. Season well with salt and pepper. Serve the salami sliced with hunks of cheese and the broad beans sprinkled with breadcrumbs. This is a vegetarian version of Le Virtù that hails from the region of Abruzzo in central Italy. It uses the end of the dried beans from winter and marries them with the first fresh vegetables. It’s comforting, but vibrant. I usually try to keep the pot count to a minimum, but this one is worth the effort. It is simple food, just with many, many components. You can, as ever, use pre-cooked beans and you don’t necessarily need all of them. Serves 8-10 For the beans:dried borlotti beans 100g (or 200g cooked)dried cannellini beans 100g (or 200g cooked)dried chickpeas 100g (or 200g cooked)brown lentils 50ggarlic 3 clovessage 1 bunchFor the fresh egg pasta:‘00’ flour 200g, plus extra for dustingeggs 2For the starch:dried pasta 250g, preferably a mix of shapes for texture, broken into piecesFor the spring ‘virtues’:celery 1 headred onion 1garlic 4 clovesparsley 1 buncholive oilbay leaves 2fennel seeds 1 tsprosemary leaves 1 tbsp, choppedtinned plum tomatoes 4, drained of juicesfresh peas and/or broad beans 200g (shelled weight)young courgettes 2 (200g), thickly slicedchard or spinach leaves 200gparmesan 100g Soak the dried beans and chickpeas in individual bowls of cold water overnight. You do not need to soak the lentils. Cook the beans, chickpeas and lentils in fresh water that covers them by 5cm, again in individual pots (as they all have different cooking times) with a clove of garlic and a few sage leaves each. Test doneness from 40 minutes onwards, adding more water where necessary. Once the beans are cooked, transfer to a large soup bowl and season with salt and pepper. Make the fresh egg pasta by using your fingers like rakes. Mix the flour and eggs in a bowl. Once shaggy and mostly mixed, knead together to make a dough. Knead the dough on the bench for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and springy. Cover and set aside to rest for 30 minutes. To roll the pasta, divide the dough in 2, keeping the other half you are not using covered. Lightly dust the bench with flour, flatten the pasta a little and roll with a wooden rolling pin. Lift the pasta and turn it through 90° frequently to avoid it sticking to the bench. Apply light dustings when necessary. When the pasta is very thin, no more than a couple of millimetres, cut into short strips several centimetres wide. Set aside – not piled up or it will stick – and repeat with the other piece of dough. You can use a pasta sheeter instead, should you have one, or indeed cut up store-bought fresh pasta. Place a large pot over a medium-low heat. Dice the celery, onion, garlic, a handful of the parsley and sweat in 3 tbsp of olive oil with the bay, fennel seeds, and chopped rosemary. When yielding, soft and sweet, add the tomatoes and cook for a moment more. Turn off, then add all the pulses. Bring another large pot of salted water to the boil and blanch the broad beans or peas, then courgettes and finally chard and remaining parsley, removing them with a slotted spoon when al dente to the pot with the other vegetables. Top up the water if necessary before you cook the dried pasta. Turn the other pot back on to medium. Three minutes before the pasta is ready, add the fresh pasta. When cooked, drain the pasta, reserving a little of the cooking water. Add a scant cup of the water to the other pot, add everything together with the cheese and stir gently to amalgamate for a few minutes, before serving with a soup ladle and plenty of extra olive oil and more grated cheese. More vegetables than eggs, this is a dish bristling with herbs and spring vitality. Add the best of what you have. Serves 6 courgettes 200gasparagus 250gred onion 1garlic 1 cloveleek 100gtinned plum tomatoes 2, drained of juicesbasil or mint a few sprigsparsley 1 small bunchpotatoes 200g, gratedeggs 6chickpea flour 20g (or wheat flour)peas 50g (shelled weight)pecorino or parmesan 100g, gratedsausages 4 (450g), good quality porksage 8 leaves Heat the oven 180C/gas mark 4. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper. Wash all the vegetables. Snap or trim the hard ends off the asparagus. Slice the courgettes as thinly as possible. Slice the onion and garlic. Cut the leek into 2, lengthwise, and then again into ribbons. Thinly slice the tomatoes. Pick the herb leaves. Grate the potato into a large bowl and add all the eggs, 2 tbsp of chickpea flour, half the cheese and a good pinch of salt. Whisk well. Add the peas, courgettes and soft herbs. De-skin and crumble the sausages and begin to fry the meat over a medium heat in several tbsp of oil. Add the onions, quickly followed by the garlic and sage. Once the onion is translucent and the sausage meat has begun to release its juices, add the asparagus and toss. When hot, add the leek. Season with pepper. Add the contents of the pan to the eggs and mix very well. Fill the baking tray with the mixture, arrange it a little, and bake for 15 or so minutes, topping with the remaining cheese and a little more oil halfway through cooking. Allow to rest before serving. This is still a fork and knife affair: you definitely want to eat it sitting at a table, preferably with a hunk of bread to round up stray asparagus fronds or leek ribbons. A great match for black coffee and good for breakfast. Serves 6 butter 115g, plus extra for greasingshelled almonds 80g, skins ondemerara sugar 60gsea saltwholemeal flour 150gricotta 450ggolden caster sugar 80geggs 2plain flour 2 tbspsingle cream 150ml Dice the butter. Process the almonds in a mixer with a pinch of salt and the demerara sugar until fine, but not a paste. Add the flour and butter and quickly pulse until like breadcrumbs. Drizzle in 3 tbsp of cold water and pulse again until the pastry is formed. Add an extra spoon of water only if necessary. Finish bringing together by hand and set aside in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Cut the pastry into pieces, squash them into a smallish buttered cake pan with a removable base to make a shell (mine is 18cm wide and 7cm high). Place in the freezer, while you heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. In a large bowl, whisk the ricotta with the caster sugar until light and fluffy. Then add the eggs, one by one, beating all the while. Finally add the cream, flour and a pinch of salt. Fill the pastry shell and bake for 30 minutes. The pie will have slightly risen, and the top should be lightly scorched. Cool completely before serving.

5/8/2022,"Peter Blake began collecting in earnest as a young teenager, and over the decades he sought out everything from elephant designs to Disney memorabilia, jigsaws to jewellery. Much of what he collected was redeployed in his work – he is famous for his pop-art collages (not least the cover of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band) and paintings of found objects, many of which came from his local car boot sale. What remains is gathered in his home in Chiswick, west London, and at his vast studio in nearby Hammersmith. “I’ve always had nice objects around me,” he says. Despite the freewheeling nature of Blake’s collection, everything is meticulously catalogued and ordered. “It’s curious that we should talk about it now,” he says of his lifelong habit, “because I’ve had six months of being rather unwell and I’m coming up to 90. Suddenly, it feels like there’s no point in adding to it.” He put this to his youngest daughter, Rose, recently, soon after a visit to a local auction house, and she replied: “Dad, how can you say that when you just bought a mermaid?” He took her point, but, he says, “it’s quite a strong feeling that everything is complete”. KF Welcome to the Collectors Edition. We all collect things. Often without noticing. Open a drawer. Rummage in the pockets of your coat. How did that get in there? Other collections are more conscious: books, records, trainers, T-shirts, “likes”… What’s that all about? I have written a book called Good Pop, Bad Pop, which is based around the objects I found in the loft of a house I used to live in. Objects I collected over the course of a lifetime & then left to gather dust in the dark. Why? Am I a hoarder? Or did I think I was laying things away “for a rainy day”? What does the collecting impulse say about us humans? I decided to devote my guest-edit of the Observer’s New Review to investigating this question. Author Olivia Laing met me at the London Library & helped me collect my thoughts on this & a number of other subjects. There’s an article called “The collectors”, which explores different aspects of collecting through interviews with Peter Blake, artist Andy Holden, quilt-maker Loretta Pettway Bennett, digital archivist (& activist) Stephen Ellcock & others. Artist Jeremy Deller meets Jonny Banger, founder of Sports Banger: a rave/fashion/food bank/political activism collective whose latest clothing collection bears the label “The People Deserve Beauty”. Gallerist Sadie Coles sheds light on the motivations of art collectors in our Q&A. Plus there’s Lias Saoudi (of Fat White Family) sharing his cultural highlights in “On my radar”. A collection of domestic objects rendered in papier-mâche in “The grid”. And a birthday shout-out (in cartoon form) to the one & only David Attenborough. I want to thank Jane Ferguson & her team at the Observer for giving me this opportunity & putting everything together so it all makes sense. Julian House designed Good Pop, Bad Pop & also brought his unique graphic sensibility to bear on this edition of the New Review. Mog Yoshihara & Kelly Kiley at Rough Trade Management set up my Zoom conversations with contributors. Jeannette Lee and Kim Sion had excellent suggestions. Raina Lampkins-Fielder introduced me to the work of the Gee’s Bend quilt-makers. Chrissy Blake hosted my interview with Peter Blake. Javi Aznarez drew a wonderful cartoon. Thank you all for your help. Happy Sunday. Love, Jarvis x PS: there’s a playlist of music referred to in Good Pop, Bad Pop – you can get a sneak peek here. JC: A lot of the things you collect end up in your work.PB: Yes, it works on different levels. What it used to be about was that you were often competing – you know someone else who collects and you want to get a better whatever than they’ve got. Did that drive you at one point? Were you a competitive collector?It did early on, yes. When the second world war started, I was seven and I was evacuated, first to Essex and then to my grandmother in Worcester. It really took away [those years] for me. It was blank time. At seven, I had a couple of lead soldiers and probably one book. Then, at 13, I went to Gravesend Technical College, to the junior art department, and at the railway station there was an old Nissen hut that was a junkyard, and I bought three objects: a painting of the RMS Queen Mary, a papier-mache Victorian tray and a complete leather-bound set of Shakespeare. That was the day I started to collect. Were you trying to catch up on what you’d missed during this blank period?Yes, I wouldn’t have been that conscious of it, but that’s where it started. Often it relates to work. I did one series called A Memory of Place where, if I went somewhere for the day, I’d collect collage material. What I collected had to be used and I couldn’t add to it. At one point, I collected Disney memorabilia. I had a phone call from this young American dealer called John Armbruster who said: “I like your work. Would you do a swap for a collection of Walt Disney?” It sounded interesting, so I agreed. A couple of weeks later, he called and said: “I’ve just arrived at Dover with the collection.” It was literally a lorry load of tea chests full of Disneyana. Things from the actual film productions?A lot of original [animation] cels, letters written by Walt Disney, toys of all kinds. I had a great Disney collection thrust upon me, I’d never tried to acquire it… I also collect elephants, I collect toys. I collect art. I collect African things. Jewellery up to a tiny point. Not watches, I don’t collect watches. When did you decide to classify it all and put it in the studio?We got this house first, which is quite big, so my studio here took a lot of the stuff. Once I bought the studio [in Hammersmith], it gave me this very beautiful space with lots of room. It gave me a little museum, really. I’ve always done that with my studios. They’ve never simply been a place to work. They’ve always been a kind of haven and somewhere separate from my house. So it created an environment that you’re happy to be in.Yeah, and that was right from the start. After I’d left the Royal College and went back home to live with my parents, my dad let me have his shed at the bottom of the garden. Even in that tiny space, I arranged it. It’s something I’ve always done. Making a little kingdom that you’re in charge of.In a way, I’m still in a shed. My studio in Hammersmith has a corrugated iron roof, so, yeah, it’s really just a much bigger shed… [In the 1990s] I was doing a series that started off being called Museum of the Colour White. I think I have seen some of that. You were just getting white objects?All white objects, and then it evolved into black and white. At the Chiswick car boot fair, I would be looking at things because they were either black or white but they had no intrinsic value as anything else – little enamel signs and that sort of thing. What was valuable to me at that point had no value to the dealers at all. Most people think of value as being a monetary thing, but what you’re saying is that the objects have got a personal value, almost like a value that you invest in them.Yes, I think that’s right. Some people are very focused on the things they collect, but you seem more open. If something interesting pops into your field of vision, you’ll think, oh, yeah, I’ll have that.Yeah. The mermaid I bought recently… Is it one of those things that sometimes you’d see in a cabinet of curiosities, where they’ve welded part of a fish on to a…?Yeah. I used to take World’s Fair, which is a trade magazine for circuses and funfairs, and there was an advertisement that just said “Freaks for sale”, and I thought, I’ve got to at least inquire. So I phoned this man named John Bowley, who had worked at the Golden Mile in Blackpool with a miniature freak show. They were contrived freaks – a bird’s body and a dog’s head and something else’s tail. Kind of creative taxidermy.Yeah. I went up to Bolton and he took me down into a terrible little cellar – it was quite freaky and he was obviously a freaky man – and I bought certain things. But that was my first mermaid. Andy Holden’s grandmother never owned a cat, but she did collect ceramic cats – hundreds of them – from charity shops. After she died, Holden, a multimedia artist and musician from Bedfordshire, inherited her collection and turned them into an installation called Cat-tharsis (2016). “My gran had been my early champion of my strange desire to be an artist and I realised that looking at her collection as a child had been an influence on my art in many ways,” he says. “The cats, when all arranged together, made a terrific sculpture that told you a lot about the person who was responsible for it.” Holden doesn’t do much collecting himself these days, but, he says, “I like to be surrounded by things, to live with things, as vehicles for stories”. His work, which has exhibited at Tate Britain and Bristol Museum, doesn’t shy away from the darker side of collecting and its links with colonialism and environmental destruction. In his 2017 show Natural Selection, commissioned by Artangel and made in collaboration with his father Peter, he explored the impulse to collect birds’ eggs. “It takes great skill and you can never complete the collection,” he says, “however it destroys the very thing you love.” Did your grandma have her collection on display at home?The cats lined the shelves of her small bungalow, floor to ceiling, staring back at you. As a child I remember asking my mum: “If grandma likes cats so much, why doesn’t she just get a cat?” But I realise now that I had entirely missed the point. She would collect them from charity shops. They were not souvenirs, often they were other people’s souvenirs, bought secondhand. It was an open-ended collection; at times she had to get rid of some to make room on the shelves to be able to continue to amass them. Why did you hang on to it after she died?Collections outlive you, and it felt natural that I’d inherit her collection. I had initially assumed the collection was about cats. Cats have always been a symbol; from their God-like status in ancient Egypt to their omnipotence as symbols of unselfconsciousness on the internet. However, I realised that it was more a portrait of my grandma. They were not about saying she went here or there, they did not contain memories, but were a way of exerting control over the present moment, over the unpredictable events of life. Everything that can’t be invested in human relationships can be invested in objects. Tell me about the art piece you created around your grandma’s collection.Soon after I inherited them I was asked to do a live performance supporting the comedian Simon Munnery. For the show I decided to “unbox” the cats on stage and tell stories about cats and my grandma, rambling towards a punchline that the process had been “cat-thartic”. I found this really helped me process my gran’s passing. I have since made this into a video, which I’ve been showing as part of the British Art Show, alongside her collection. It is a way of thinking about how the things we collect and surround ourselves with tells us about who we are. The ceramic cats, with their absurd long necks, big eyes and vase-like decoration, at first appear kitsch and trivial, but through talking about them, my grandma reappears. The first piece I saw by you was your Natural Selection exhibition with Artangel, made in collaboration with your dad, in which you explore how birds make their nests. As part of the exhibition you recreated a bowerbird’s bower. Is collecting an instinct?The bowerbird is a unique collector and arranger of objects. It gathers up shells, feathers and sometimes blue plastic and places them around the bower, demonstrating aesthetic preference. I think it shows the impulse to gather objects around us for display is indeed a natural impulse. What do you collect?At the moment I’m only collecting my thoughts. I have started a diary to try to collect them all in one place. If I wasn’t a maker, who makes more than I part with, I think I’d be a collector, because I like to be surrounded by things, to live with things, as vehicles for stories. As a kid I collected all sorts; fossils, shells, bits of toys, stones. My first exhibition at Tate Britain was about the impulse to collect. When I was 10 I “collected” a piece of stone from the side of the Great Pyramid of Giza. But when I got home I felt terrible about it, as my dad said: “If everyone did that there wouldn’t be any pyramid left.” So this stone in my collection filled me with guilt, and 15 years later I decided to travel to Egypt again and return it to where I’d taken it from. I then made a 100,000 times enlarged knitted replica of the stone called Pyramid Piece, a kind of monument to a piece of a monument. It was a little parable about the desire to want to possess objects that are significant to us, and what can be undone. It was also a comment on colonial guilt, and the objects in some of our beloved museum “collections”. Cat-tharsis will be part of the British Art Show 9 in Plymouth, from 8 October to 23 December; andyholdenartist.com A lifelong collector of images, torn from comics, magazines and books, Stephen Ellcock made the transition from physical to digital with the advent of social media. He now curates a vast online museum of “visual delights, oddities and wonders” from all over the world, reaching more than 300,000 people via his Facebook and Instagram pages. The popularity of his online work has propelled him back into the world of print: in 2019 he published All Good Things: A Treasury of Images to Uplift the Spirits and Reawaken Wonder, following it up last year with The Book of Change: Images to Inspire Revelations and Revolutions. His latest book, published on 10 May, with words by Mat Osman of Suede, is England on Fire: A Visual Journey Through Albion’s Psychic Landscape. I came across something you said in an online interview that really chimed with me, quoting the Portuguese novelist and Nobel prize winner José Saramago. It was the idea that collectors do it to try to ward off the chaos of reality. Has that been your experience?Yes, definitely. I’ve always collected images and it’s an impulse that was initiated from a very early age. I used to vandalise comics, magazines, books, anything I could get my hands on and I would accumulate them in various plastic bags, which I dragged around with me. I probably vandalised things that would be worth a fortune now, everything from very early Marvel comics and copies of countercultural underground press, like Oz and International Times, and then early zines like Ripped and Torn and Sniffin’ Glue. Every so often I would get them all out and sort of have them like… Have you ever seen the famous photograph of André Malraux, who came up with the idea of an imaginary museum? I haven’t, no.He was a grand old man of French letters, and he had this idea of creating a museum without walls, a musée imaginaire, and there were some extraordinary photographs of him in these vast halls and he’s on his hands and knees with hundreds of postcards and photographs and things taken from books, shifting them around and trying to make patterns out of them. I was a bit like that, only with things torn out of Howard the Duck and early issues of Silver Surfer. I had this idea to make a vast collage that would be like a visual map of everything. Nothing ever came of it. I was dragging this stuff around with me right into adulthood, until I had to move rapidly and I lost all of it. How did you feel when you lost the stuff? Did it devastate you?No it didn’t. In a sense it was quite liberating, though it did get replaced by a mania for book collecting. That urge has now been tamed. I’m in control of it and that’s kind of satisfying. Social media has been my life-saver in a way. When it was a physical collection, did you ever invite other people to see it or was it solely for your benefit?It was solely for my benefit. I did do a bit of decorating, gluing and Sellotaping things and stapling things to walls and bits of furniture that looked a bit like the Joe Orton/Kenneth Halliwell flat in Noel Road, where the walls were covered in images torn from books from Islington library. It would have looked a bit like that, I think. Is the reason you feel in control of it now because digital images don’t take up physical space? Is it also something to do with the fact that you are now sharing it with people and getting feedback?Definitely. It’s also partly to do with a change of circumstances. Instead of a fairly torrid and unstable past, my life is now quite staid and reclusive, so the feedback is great. I’m wary about saying things that may create a puff for Mark Zuckerberg, but Instagram and Facebook do have their uses. Joining Facebook was completely life-transforming for me. It provided a platform where you could create this endless museum, this infinite archive of things. Where do you find your images now? Do you find them all online or do you scan things from books?Ninety-nine per cent of the stuff I find and post is all online. There are the most extraordinary archives freely available that people don’t know about. Basically everything you could ever imagine is there or will be soon, as great institutions and libraries and museums digitise their collections. Do you think that images can speak to people in a subconscious or subliminal way? Because the way that you arrange stuff in your books is for a specific purpose isn’t it?Yes, that is exactly my intention. The key thing is to seek juxtaposition and correlation, correspondences between images. The individual images are less important than the overall arc of the books. It’s sometimes like Keats’s idea of negative capability. It becomes like a trance-like state, and certainly when I’m putting the books together, I sometimes think: “Oh, that really works. That juxtaposition is fantastic, I don’t know how that happened.” See more at instagram.com/stephenellcock In 2002, Houston’s Museum of Fine Arts put on a major exhibition dedicated to the quilts of Gee’s Bend, Alabama. The first show of its kind in the US, it toured 12 cities around the US and contained work – by women descended from generations of slaves on the nearby cotton plantations – that the New York Times described as “some of the most miraculous works of modern art America has produced”. Many of the quilts on show were made by the extended family of Loretta Pettway Bennett, who started quilting aged five or six and continues the tradition to this day, collecting material from thrift stories and turning them into glorious works of art. Her latest show, at the end of 2021, was at the Greg Kucera gallery in Seattle. Could you explain to Observer readers in the UK where Gee’s Bend is in the States?Gee’s Bend is in the south, Alabama actually. It’s a 45-minute drive south-west of Selma, which is a little city that people are probably familiar with, and about a two-hour drive from [the state capital] Montgomery. So is it quite a remote place?Yes, very remote. It’s a little horseshoe peninsula [on the Alabama river] and there’s only one way in. No street lights, just docks and fields and woods. And do you know how the tradition of making the quilts started?[Gee’s Bend is] in a rural area and the houses were not that well built – log cabins and whatnot – so whatever little they got in this area, they took it and made quilts out of it to keep warm, or keep the dust out, or to put over the windows to keep the cold out. They didn’t have the means to buy material, so they used what they had. What age were you when you first made one?I was about 12 or 13 when I made a whole quilt, one that would cover a bed. How did you know you were ready?I grew up looking at my mom and grandmother and aunties making quilts. This usually happened in the summertime after they had gotten everything growing in the field – what they call “laid by”. While they were waiting for the harvest, they pieced their quilts up. Our job was to thread the needles. The girls, and some of the boys too, practised on the little pieces that were discarded. One summer, I decided I’m going to make a flower garden quilt, octagon shape. It was not the easiest quilt to make for a beginner. It took me all summer to do it and it came out lopsided – but I made it. And I never made another one like it. One of your quilts that caught my eye was made from denim, from bits of jeans and stuff.Yes. When I thought of really getting back into making quilts, I decided to do what my mom and grandma did and use what I had at hand. So I used old denim that we weren’t wearing any more and that I hadn’t donated to a thrift store. For this article, I’ve been talking to people who collect things and sometimes it can become a real burden for them. But you’re finding a use for things that a lot of people would just throw away. The things you collect, you use to make something else. It isn’t just a collection. That must be a nice feeling.Oh yes it is. I will keep things to pass on to someone else, but it turns out to be even better to turn it into a quilt and pass it on to somebody else. Someone loved wearing these jeans or this denim shirt or dress. What a way to share that love with someone else, by turning it into something that they can use. Where do you find your materials?Thrift stores, for the most part. I have friends who give me clothes that they’ve decided they’re not going to wear any more. I do alteration also, and if it’s big enough to cut, it’s big enough to sew. When I went into the loft where my things were stored, all the clothes were ruined because the moths had been in and eaten them. How do you stop that? Do you have a special room that you store all your bits of material in?I keep them in a plastic bag or plastic containers. When I was growing up, my mom used to keep them in between the mattress and the box frame, and that kept the bugs or anything from getting to them. They kept for many years. I have some that I just got from my cousin about two years ago and they had them maybe in the 50s, maybe even earlier than that. You can feel the cotton seeds still in there. Of all the quilts that you’ve made, is there one that you could say was your favourite or that meant the most to you?There’s one that I sold some years ago and it was [made from] a pair of denims with a hole in the knee belonging to my youngest son. I tried getting those jeans from him but he would wear them every day. I tried buying them from him. He was, like, “no”. I had to wait until he outgrew the pants before I could cut them up and put them in a quilt. That’s one of my favourites.

The collection filled their five-bedroom family house in Manchester, spilling out into the garage and garden, and becoming so unmanageable that Townsend was no longer able to catalogue it properly. The sorting is nearly complete – Sunflower is leaving the house later this year – and his father’s collection has already spawned a book called Wrappers Delight, written by the DJ and label boss Jonny Trunk (with an introduction by Jarvis Cocker). You’ve got an interesting insight into collecting as you witnessed your dad amassing his collection. And also, you’ve been left as the custodian of it after his death.Yeah, absolutely. That’s an understatement. When you were a kid, did you enjoy helping out with it?When my dad was working as a rep, he would call into shops and he’d quite often pick up full boxes of, like, 144 bits of bubblegum in a wax wrapper with three or four cards in each, and he’d come back with four boxes, so we’d have 600 packets to open. We had to sort out all the cards into sets and so on. It seemed to me that you gave a rueful laugh when I said that you’ve been left to deal with your dad’s collection. As I understand it the house that your dad lived in was absolutely rammed with stuff. Is that right?Yeah, there was a garage and a caravan, which we’ve now emptied and dismantled. And he had built five sheds in the garden as well. It’s a five-bedroom detached house, so it’s not like a tiny house. I’ve got two brothers, and as we all left home – my mum died 30 years ago – my dad just expanded into the areas that were becoming vacant. So before we knew it, our old bedrooms were also full of things, and the faster the stuff came in, the less he was able to sort through it and get it catalogued and organised. So all the stuff that came in after we left was just random collections in bags and boxes, and every room was just wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling. You had trouble walking around the house. It sounds like a mammoth task for you. It must have been difficult, because collecting this stuff was very important to your dad, but other people would say, “Well, it’s just rubbish…”Yeah. You know, he collected other people’s rubbish – he wanted people to save their junk mail and bring it to him, only part of which he managed to sort through. So I’d have a load of Hacienda club flyers, and a load of tourist information leaflets, all in the same bag. We had to go through every little thing, but we’ve pretty much sorted it now. How long has that taken you?He died in December 2014. It has taken us all that time to do it. Did he ever talk about how he got started in collecting and why he collected things?He said he was collecting for future generations. If he didn’t do it, then who would? Obviously, some other people did, but a lot of the stuff he collected has become quite scarce. The way that he collected things, his need for completion, was really – what can you say – a bit off the scale. You say that your dad’s ambition was to preserve things for future generations, and that was the first thing I thought when I looked at your book Wrappers Delight. It instantly took me back to my childhood, and these things that I would buy from the corner shop. I guess it worked on me as he wanted it to.Everyone I show the book to, straight away they go, “Oh, I remember that”. They’re back in their childhood. Quite often it leads on to, “Yeah, I remember we used to go to such and such a place and pick these up”, or, “Oh yeah, we’d have one of those after we’d been swimming”. People start talking about their life and their experiences. It’s just a fascinating way in. Do you actually collect anything yourself? Or has it put you off for life?Well, Paula’s over the other side of the room, and she’s saying harmonicas. I don’t collect harmonicas, I’m a harmonica player – that’s my job, has been for 30 years. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen these 2ft-long chord harmonicas and a bass harmonica the size of a house brick. It used to belong to Viv Stanshall [of the Bonzo Dog Doo-dah Band]. I’m probably the only person in the country with two 2ft-long harmonicas. But do I collect anything? Well, I’m kind of collecting things that I like, that my dad had collected. I’ve got a stack of these advertising-back playing cards, because they’re lovely, with images of a time gone by. Wrapper’s Delight is published by Fuel (£24.95) Patrice Caillet collects vinyl, but not in the usual way. Instead of valuing the pristine, the unblemished, he seeks out records that have been damaged or modified in some way, intentionally or otherwise. One long-running project, stored at his home in the suburbs of Paris, is a collection of record sleeves that have been defaced by previous owners or reimagined in a way that, for Caillet, could be seen as an art form in its own right. When did you start this collection?In 1996 or thereabouts. And why?I collect many things, and it can be a kind of artistic endeavour, looking at the crossover between popular culture and contemporary art. A couple of friends and I did a project called Sounds of Silence, and had fun collecting any recordings of silence, from the beginning to the end of the record industry. I collect the records you’d get in audio booths, from the 60s to the 80s. And there’s a new project: records that are very damaged, almost scrap, considered trash, that you find at flea markets, and, when you play them, they skid and jump, and I assemble the interesting tracks. I was just in Switzerland for a contemporary music festival called Archipel and, with a friend who also works in sound recording, we played these types of records, presenting the project as Ethnophonograpie du Dimanche – a play on peintre du Dimanche, someone who paints only on Sunday, an amateur artist. The idea is to recreate, phonographically, sound landscapes that were produced accidentally. It might be the last time we get to hear these records because they’ve reached the very end of the consumer chain. So, that’s the latest project, but the pochettes modifiés – the modified or customised record sleeves – I’ve been collecting for a very long time. With them, it’s interesting because if one collects records, it’s their condition that’s the most important thing – near-mint or “very good plus”. And usually, if the sleeve has been torn or changed, that makes the record less valuable.Yes, it’s very strange for me because it allows me to buy cheap records! Of course, it’s also a way of exploring the excesses of mass consumption, or the tail-end of that consumption. But the sleeves, the silent tracks, the modified or broken records, they always tell a story. And they’re quite intimate stories. You might have modified a record by listening to a song again and again because you idolise the artist, and then want to embellish the sleeve. Or because you hate the artist. Or you might have borrowed it from a little brother or sister, or your parents, and indulged in corrupting the record in some way, whether destructively or with irony, or whatever. There are many different motivations for modifying records and sleeves, or in some way “remaking” them, because you get both. There are records that have been entirely modified on purpose – adolescents sometimes try to create their own work of art – and I find these just as interesting as works of contemporary art. In fact, there’s an interesting link there between the world of contemporary art and that of l’art brut, or primitive art. Because, whether someone makes rudimentary changes, or adds a moustache, like Marcel Duchamp did on the Mona Lisa in 1919, when people do that in a spontaneous, naive, or rebellious way, there’s always “intentionality” there. The ones I find interesting are when the real sleeve was lost or torn and so someone makes a whole new sleeve, so it’s like a whole new design and their idea of what the record sleeve should be. Have you ever met anyone who has actually made one of these sleeves?Sometimes, at garage sales or flea markets, you can meet the owner, but when I ask them about it, they can be a bit embarrassed or awkward. Some might say, “Yes, I made it”, because what they’ve created is beautiful, but others are disparaging about what they themselves have made. It’s funny, some people are very proud of their creations, and others a little ashamed, saying, “I was young, I did it without thinking”, and so they have no interest in it. I’ve met some people who would modify record sleeves almost systematically. That all changed with the arrival of CDs, because then there was the plastic case. So it’s all about the vinyl records that were bought between the 60s and 90s. And do you have your collection on display chez vous, or is it kept somewhere separate?No, the complete collection is in my home. Do you have a particular favourite among the record sleeves you own?My favourite sleeves are those modified by my children when they were young, they made some sleeves for me!Interview translated by Hildegarde Serle Good Pop, Bad Pop by Jarvis Cocker is published by Vintage (£20).

5/8/2022,"Noël Coward worked on two plays that openly featured same-sex relationships at a time when homosexuality was still illegal in England, and strict censorship laws governed theatres, new research reveals. The master playwright was planning to write about a homosexual triangle in one play and to confront homophobic prejudice in another, according to an unpublished letter of 1960 and an unknown scene for an unfinished 1967 drama. The discoveries have been made by Russell Jackson, emeritus professor of drama at the University of Birmingham, who told the Observer: “I was surprised to find this evidence that Coward wanted to deal more frankly with homosexuality than he had ever been able to before in a play.” It was not until 1967 that the Sexual Offences Act decriminalised private homosexual acts between men in England and Wales aged 21 and over, and 1968 when the Theatres Act repealed a law that had enabled the Lord Chamberlain’s Office to censor or ban any play. Under the Licensing Act of 1737 and the Theatres Act of 1843, it had been a legal requirement for all plays intended for public performance to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain’s Office for licensing. Plays deemed indecent or offensive could be rejected or censored, although by the end of the 1950s, playwrights sensed new freedoms. Jackson said: “As a gay man, Coward exercised discretion in his public persona. And as a playwright, until the last decade of his career, he was constrained by the theatrical censorship of the Lord Chamberlain’s Office from directly addressing homosexuality.” He continued: “A number of Coward’s published and performed plays had included identifiably – if not explicitly – gay or lesbian characters. The emphasis in A Song at Twilight in 1966 would not be on the central character’s homosexuality in itself, but the subterfuges by which he had managed to pass as heterosexual.” Coward, a playwright, actor and composer, died in 1973, aged 73. He was the son of an unsuccessful piano salesman and was raised as a working-class boy in the south-west London suburb of Teddington. Making his name in 1924 with a serious play, The Vortex, about a drug-addicted son and dissolute mother, he became one of the foremost playwrights of the 20th century, best-known for classic comedies including Hay Fever, Blithe Spirit and Private Lives and as the co-writer of David Lean’s classic 1945 film, Brief Encounter. The 1960 letter was written by his much-loved assistant Lorn Loraine, who had worked for him since the 1930s and whose opinions he greatly valued. It reveals that Coward had created a love triangle between three men – called Owen, Trevor and John – one of whom appears to be married. “Darling master,” Loraine wrote, “I have thought a lot about this play outline and I feel strongly that [it] must be treated entirely psychologically and with restraint and no sign of melodrama. “I have been wondering whether it would be a good idea for Trevor to have had an affair with Owen Fletcher but to be really, all the time, deeply and jealously in love with John – a love which John has never returned and which has therefore turned sour.” Jackson said that in 1967 Coward started writing a play called Age Cannot Wither, some of which has been published: “But there’s a part of it that’s not – the second scene.” It features Naomi, an independent-minded grandmother in her 60s who scolds her daughter-in-law, Melissa, over her inability to accept that Naomi’s grandson, Jasper, has left his wife to live with another man, an antiques dealer. Naomi tells her to “behave with more dignity”, adding: “Please go away … and give your acids time to settle. I know you are genuinely distressed and upset and, in spite of what you say, I assure you that I have not the least desire to patronise you or insult you. As far as the Jasper situation is concerned there is nothing we can any of us do at the moment beyond keeping calm. “I see clearly that you are much more shocked by it than I am but that perhaps can be accounted for by the difference in our generations. I have a feeling that only the very old or the very young are capable of understanding the social and moral values of these strange times.” The unpublished material will feature in Jackson’s forthcoming book, Noël Coward: The Playwright’s Craft in a Changing Theatre, to be published later this month. Jackson unearthed the unpublished material in researching the Coward archives, which are divided between London, where they are administered by the Noël Coward Archive Trust, and the Noël Coward Collection at Birmingham University’s Cadbury Research Library. The holdings boast manuscript and typescript drafts and personal and professional correspondence, among “boxes and boxes” of material, Jackson said. Alan Brodie of the Coward estate said: “We’re delighted that the archive continues to throw up surprises and that it shows just how, from The Vortex onwards, he wasn’t frightened to explore controversial [for the time] issues.” Noël Coward: The Playwright’s Craft in a Changing Theatre is published on 19 May by Methuen Drama, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing.",Arts/Stage,Revealed: Noël Coward’s unseen plays aimed to deal with homosexuality ,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/revealed-noel-cowards-unseen-plays-aimed-to-deal-with-homosexuality
5/8/2022,"About 20m acres of cropland in the United States may be contaminated from PFAS-tainted sewage sludge that has been used as fertilizer, a new report estimates. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds used to make products heat-, water- or stain-resistant. Known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down, they have been linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, liver problems, birth defects, immunosuppression and more. Dozens of industries use PFAS in thousands of consumer products, and often discharge the chemicals into the nation’s sewer system. The analysis, conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), is an attempt to understand the scope of cropland contamination stemming from sewage sludge, or biosolids. Regulators don’t require sludge to be tested for PFAS or closely track where its spread, and public health advocates warn the practice is poisoning the nation’s food supply. “We don’t know the full scope of the contamination problem created by PFAS in sludge, and we may never know, because EPA has not made it a priority for states and local governments to track, test and report on,” said Scott Faber, EWG’s legislative policy director. All sewage sludge is thought to contain the dangerous chemicals, and the compounds have recently been found to be contaminating crops, cattle, water and humans on farms where biosolids were spread. Sludge is a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process that’s a mix of human excrement and industrial waste, like PFAS, that’s discharged from industry’s pipes. Sludge disposal can be expensive so the waste management industry is increasingly repackaging it as fertilizer because excrement is rich in plant nutrients. EWG found Ohio keeps the most precise records of any state, and sludge has been applied to 5% of its farmland since 2011. Extrapolating that across the rest of the country would mean about 20m acres are contaminated with at least some level of PFAS. Faber called the estimate “conservative”. EPA records show over 19bn pounds of sludge has been used as fertilizer since 2016 in the 41 states where the agency tracks the amount of sludge that’s spread, but not the location. It’s estimated that 60% of the nation’s sludge is spread on cropland or other fields annually. The consequences are evident in the only two states to consistently check sludge and farms for PFAS contamination. In Maine, PFAS-tainted fields have already forced several farms to shut down. The chemicals end up in crops and cattle, and the public health toll exacted by contaminated food in Maine is unknown. Meanwhile, the state is investigating about 700 more fields for PFAS pollution. “There’s no easy way to shop around this problem,” Faber said. “We shouldn’t be using PFAS-contaminated sludge to grow food and feed for animals.” Michigan faces a similar situation as it uncovers contaminated beef and farms, and growing evidence links sludge to public health problems and contaminated drinking water. The health cost of using sludge outweighs the benefits, advocates say. Many have questioned the sense in spending billions of dollars to pull sludge out of water only to inject the substance into the nation’s food supply, and calls for a ban on the practice are growing louder. “The EPA could today require treatment plants to test sludge for PFAS and warn farmers that they may be contaminating fields, but it has refused to do so,” Faber said.",News/Environment,"‘Forever chemicals’ may have polluted 20m acres of US cropland, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/08/us-cropland-may-be-contaminated-forever-chemicals-study
5/8/2022,"Frank Dobson, the former Labour MP for Holborn and St Pancras, is dead. And yet his corpse seems to have been reanimated, purely to discredit the Labour party, at the incompetent behest of the bleary late night Tory disinformation-sluice Nadine Dorries. The Keirgate Beergate confusion campaign, by the Conservatives and their slave journalists, attempts to associate Starmer in the public mind with lockdown breaches by simple front-page repetition of unfounded accusations. Its purpose is to distract from the government’s own well-documented and proved Partygate crimes and its broader ethical, moral, financial, social and administrative failings. It’s like trying to cover up the Great Train Robbery by pointing out that someone else somewhere else once said the word “train”. The best endgame for the fridge-dweller-in-chief is the criminally misinformed check-in woman at the hotel in Tunbridge Wells saying resignedly: “They’re all as bad as each other” when I ask her if she’ll be voting in the local elections. Job done! Last week, Dorries circulated a photograph of Keir Starmer supposedly feasting on Indian foods during lockdown in April 2021. But the picture was cropped from a shot of Starmer dining with Dobson, who had carelessly died two years earlier in 2019, meaning it is unlikely that the picture was taken in April 2021, as if it had been it would have featured just a skellington with all curry on its face. The so-called woke “brigade” was quick to ridicule Dorries for her mis-post, despite her dyslexia. Cruelly, a little-known dyslexia side-effect is the involuntary dissemination of photos suggesting people dined in Indian restaurants long after their own deaths and yet still the caviar communists sneer. It seems the virtue-signallers’ “sympathies” for the afflicted are discounted if they happen to be on the right of British politics. Conservative MPs know there is no equivalence between Boris Johnson’s deliberate breaches of lockdown regulations and Starmer’s unproven breach of lockdown regulations. But they keep shtum, moral whistleblowing being a luxury even those relatively untainted backbenchers being punted as possible antidotes to the Augean filth of the Johnson years can’t afford. Instead, they cling to whatever passing falsehoods will keep them afloat, like turds floating down the especially frothy sewer of the Conservative party’s bloodstream. Sorry. Did I say “turds”? I meant “local turds”, in order to differentiate them from those other turds, you know, the bad turds, in Westminster. The Tories and the rightwing press think we really need to discuss something Starmer probably didn’t do and shouldn’t “move on”. They also think we really don’t need to discuss a lot of things Johnson definitely did do and should “move on”. It is a textbook definition of cognitive dissonance. The entire Conservative machine is Norman Osborn arguing with a reflection of the Green Goblin in a full-length mirror, but with worse teeth and no exploding pumpkins. And isn’t it supposed to be a crime to waste police time? Meanwhile, the compliant house eunuchs of the BBC question Starmer on the Durham non-story while entirely failing to cover, on any level, the police raid on Tory peer Michelle Mone’s home, possibly in search of £203m of suspiciously awarded pandemic PPE contracts. The Conservatives’ noble attempt, last week, to divert attention from their failings by getting everyone to talk about the actual colour of Angela Rayner’s actual pubic hair had already failed, despite its online amplification by hundreds of newly activated Soviet-style Conservative propaganda bots with plausible fake identities. Did Ada Lovelace invent the computer so made-up people could discuss Angela Rayner’s vulva, in order to drown out real people talking about a man who experienced a tractor-sex career fatality? No. The constantly confused culture secretary Dorries recently promised that “the British internet”, whatever that is, will be the most trustworthy in the world. It could be, if she herself just stays off it. Especially after about 10pm at the weekends. And if Conservatives generally would just stop lying. Everywhere. All the time. Check out this tweet, so insane it must surely be deliberately stupid, sent out on Wednesday by Dorries: “The man who wants one day to be prime minister cannot behave like this. He has a responsibility to be open, honest and transparent with the public.” Meanwhile, the man who actually is prime minister can lie about everything for ever all the time. Parties; children; mistresses; employment figures; new hospitals; Jimmy Savile. Everything. But maybe Dobson was eating in Durham, despite being dead for a number of years? Perhaps he did dine on dhansak and wine, while squirming Starmer chewed chana masala? Maybe the dead member for Holborn and St Pancras burned his beard on hot chicken madras, while beery Starmer scoffed spinach paneer? Did the deceased health secretary down meat biryani, while the Labour ex-lawyer just snacked on pakora? There are more things in Dorries’s 11pm Twitter feed, Horatio, than are dreamed of in your philosophy. On Saturday, I bisected the moors between shows in Crewe and Huddersfield, skirting Alderley Edge, where legends say King Arthur lies sleeping, awaiting Albion’s hour of need. Like the mythical king, Dobson was a convivial character thought to embody Britain at its best. Perhaps he has returned in our moment of national peril. Is Dobson with us now, once more, like Arthur, in the dying land’s time of crisis, steering thirsty Starmer’s lip towards the lassi-filled grail of a parliamentary majority? Confronted with evidence of a starving pensioner sitting on the bus all day to keep warm, by a suddenly significant Piers-free Suzanna Reid on GMB, Johnson merely took the credit for inventing free bus travel for pensioners, but even that turned out to be a lie.

5/8/2022,"Afew days ago, a friend sent me a screenshot of an online survey sent by his children’s school and a company called ParentPay, which provides technology for cashless payments in schools. “To help speed up school meal service, some areas of the UK are trialling using biometric technology such as facial identity scanners to process payments. Is this something you’d be happy to see used in your child’s school?” One of three responses was allowed: yes, no and “I would like more information before agreeing”. My friend selected “no”, but I wondered what would have happened if he had asked for more information before agreeing. Who would provide it? The company that stands to profit from his children’s faces? Fortunately, Defend Digital Me’s report, The State of Biometrics 2022: A Review of Policy and Practice in UK Education, was published last week, introduced by Fraser Sampson, the UK’s biometrics and surveillance camera commissioner. It is essential reading for anyone who cares about children. First, it reminds us that the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, which protects children’s biometrics (such as face and fingerprints), applies only in England and Wales. Second, it reveals that the information commissioner’s office has still not ruled on the use of facial recognition technology in nine schools in Ayrshire, which was reported in the media in October 2021, much less the legality of the other 70 schools known to be using the technology across the country. Third, it notes that the suppliers of the technology are private companies based in the UK, the US, Canada and Israel. The report also highlights some gaping holes in our knowledge about the use of facial recognition technology in British schools. For instance, who in government approved these contracts? How much has this cost the taxpayer? Why is the government using a technology that is banned in several US states and which regulators in France, Sweden, Poland and Bulgaria have ruled unlawful on the grounds that it is neither necessary nor proportionate and does not respect children’s privacy? Why are British children’s rights not held to the same standard as their continental counterparts? The report also warns that this technology does not just identify children or allow them to transact with their bodies. It can be used to assess their classroom engagement, mood, attentiveness and behaviour. One of the suppliers, CRB Cunninghams, advertises that it scans children’s faces every three months and that its algorithm “constantly evolves to match the child’s growth and change of appearance”. So far, MPs have been strikingly silent on the use of such technology in schools. Instead, two members of the House of Lords have sounded the alarm. In 2019, Lord Clement-Jones put forward a private member’s bill for a moratorium and review of all uses of facial recognition technology in the UK. The government has yet to give this any serious consideration. Undaunted, his colleague Lord Scriven said last week that he would put forward a private member’s bill to ban its use in British schools. It’s difficult not to wish the two lords well when you return to CRB Cunninghams’ boasts about its technology. “The algorithm grows with the child,” it proclaims. That’s great, then: what could go wrong?  Stephanie Hare is a researcher and broadcaster.

5/8/2022,"Many people loved working from home during the pandemic. They got to spend more time with their families, adopted more pets, enjoyed the magic of delivery services, binged Netflix, swapped their suits for sweats and even started an unprecedented number of businesses. All these reasons – and plenty of others – are behind why so many workers want to continue doing the same, even as we try to put Covid in the rearview mirror. For those employees, here’s a warning: prepare for reality. Employers are planning to have you back in the office. Why else would Facebook lease another 300,000 sq feet of office space in New York City to add to its already 3m sq feet occupied? Why would Google be spending $2.1bn on a Manhattan office building and expand its “sprawling campus” in the city to house its more than 12,000 employees? These are tech companies with businesses built on the cloud … so why expand offices? And why would Manhattan’s commercial real estate market be “rebounding” with CRBE, which tracks these sorts of things, reporting that leasing activity rose 100% year over year as of 31 March? “We just hit 95% occupancy, which is the highest occupancy number in the history of the building,” gushed one New York City landlord. This is not just a New York City thing, either. In Charleston, South Carolina, commercial vacancy rates are below 2% and almost 10m sq feet of industrial space is under construction. In Jacksonville, Florida, 2021 was a “great year” for commercial real estate investors, with all product types posting increases in market rent, occupancy and interest from buyers. Northwest Arkansas commercial real estate has its lowest vacancy rate since 2005. In Philadelphia, Baltimore, Santa Clara and Chicago, there’s a post-pandemic “boom” in mixed-use commercial and residential properties under development. Developers in Iowa say that industrial spaces “cannot be built fast enough”. Office vacancy rates continue to decline in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange county, California. If everyone’s “working from home” – as we hear again and again in the media – why is the commercial office space market booming? Yes, there’s more demand for warehousing thanks to all those Amazon orders. But it’s also because of something else: everyone is not going to be working from home in the months to come. They’re coming back to the office. Sure, the big companies are still slow to bring their employees back. Larger organizations from Goldman Sachs to KPMG – worried about bad PR and potential lawsuits – are tentatively allowing employees to determine their own arrangements. But this is quickly changing. More than half of corporate leaders want their people back in the office five days a week, according to a new study from Microsoft. Even GenZ-ers view remote working negatively! So will these workers return? They’re not going to have a choice. We know that many employees are reluctant to come back to the office. Just this past week, a study found that more than half of Apple’s workforce would like to quit their jobs because they prefer working from home. Other studies – like this one and this one – have shown that workers overwhelmingly prefer to keep working from their homes in lieu of commuting. Who can blame them? But as much as employees want to work from home all the time, that’s just not going to happen. The reality is that workers at the nation’s small businesses – who employ about half of our workforce – have been back to the office for a while now. When I visit my clients – who are almost all small to midsized firms – their employees are at their desks. If you don’t believe me, take a drive around your town’s suburbs and look at the parking lots. There’s no question that work-from-home arrangements are now a core benefit that businesses must provide. My best clients are re-addressing their work cultures and doing their best to offer as much flexibility for their employees as they can allow. But there will be a limit. I don’t know any who are going fully virtual and very, very few that are allowing their employees to work remotely for more than two days a week. That’s because employers know that real work gets done when teams can be together, face-to-face, and collaborate, innovate and yes, even socialize. They also know that working from home can be difficult for some, cause loneliness and depression in others and also provide opportunities to avoid the work they’re actually being paid for in lieu of running their side-gigs. Working from home is here to stay. But – judging from what we’re seeing in commercial real estate – companies are expanding, not abandoning, their offices. Many employers are doing their best to help transition their employees back. But in the end, this is business. And business gets done in a workplace, which means coming into the office – at least most of the time – is a reality that workers are going to have to face.",Opinion/Opinion,"If everyone’s working from home, why is commercial office space booming? | Gene Marks",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/08/working-from-home-commercial-office-space-booming
5/8/2022,"DI Ray (ITV) | itv.comThe Staircase (Sky Atlantic) | sky.comThe Dry (BritBox) | britbox.co.ukPrisoner C33 (BBC Four)| iPlayer At some point, television will reach a state of detective-show saturation and the entire genre will collapse into a gurgling, subscriber-only sinkhole. For now, there’s ITV’s DI Ray, the latest of several female-led series – Vigil, Trigger Point – from the Line of Duty production stable (I have Jed Mercurio pegged as a secret feminist). Created and written by Maya Sondhi (Line of Duty’s PC Bindra), DI Ray ran over four consecutive nights last week, with Parminder Nagra (Bend It Like Beckham, ER) as Detective Inspector Rachita Ray. If DI Ray has a theme, it’s that racism, overt and veiled, leaves sticky fingerprints everywhere. After Ray soothes a psychotic, knife-wielding Asian man, she is promoted to the serious crime unit at her Birmingham police department by a pale and stale superintendent (Ian Puleston-Davies) who asks where she is from. An odd, clumsy moment: you’d have hoped, these days, that such an out-of-touch clown would be forcibly shuffled into early retirement. Just as in a supermarket Ray is mistaken for a shelf-stacker, at work her superior (Gemma Whelan) talks of “culturally specific homicides”. As Ray sighs to her fiance (Jamie Bamber): “They all know I’ve been brought in to tick a box.” I ended up liking Sondhi’s stereotype-stomping spirit more than the story: a convoluted tale that pointedly rubbished hackneyed race tropes (honour killing), but then meandered down other predictable alleys, such as human trafficking. As the episodes plodded on, it started to feel like an extended “social issue” episode of The Bill. Good actors (Whelan, Steve Oram), deprived of lines or agency, stand about like human scenery. The “twist” is so signposted it practically has satnav. Saying that, I like DI Ray herself. Nagra hits uncomfortable, all-too-human notes – acid, seething, deflated – reminiscent of Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley. In terms of characterisation, it deserves another outing. Watching the opening trio of available episodes of Sky Atlantic’s new eight-part series The Staircase, a dramatisation of a Netflix crime documentary of the same name, a thought keeps pulsing: “Is this fair on Kathleen Peterson?” But then, has any of it been? Played by Toni Collette, Kathleen – believed murdered by her novelist husband Michael (Colin Firth) in 2001 – is found bloodied at the bottom of the stairs in their mansion in Durham, North Carolina. There are flashbacks portraying the death, first as an “accident”, then as a murder, and the obligatory morgue shots of her shaved, gashed head. At one point, the Petersons have “rimming” sex against a kitchen island. While illuminating about their marital erotic life, would Kathleen have wanted this depicted? Murder victims are inevitably consigned to corpse and flashback in drama, but there are times when Kathleen feels exposed, exploited and, worse, secondary, a narrative ghost in her own story. Created by Antonio Campos, thus far The Staircase works best when it focuses on the interfamilial fallout of this infamously complex, drawn-out case (Michael Peterson was first found guilty, then released after a retrial that ended in a plea deal with him still proclaiming his innocence). Initially privileged, then fractured, the family – some convinced of his guilt – are portrayed beautifully, especially the couple’s grownup children, played by Olivia DeJonge, Sophie Turner and Patrick Schwarzenegger. Michael Peterson was bisexual, and The Staircase is also strong on the homophobic, dirt-digging aspects of the case. I’m less taken with the recurring focus on the making of the original series. (Its director, Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, co-executive produces, and is portrayed by Vincent Vermignon.) While the documentary had a huge impact, here it’s all rather overplayed and self-indulgent, and you end up thinking: get over yourself. Juliette Binoche, as a TV editor whose involvement grows personal, is so painfully miscast that she becomes borderline unwatchable. Collette does her considerable best with a stunted role, while Firth is almost too good as the twitchy, self-absorbed, often dislikable suspect. Maybe like me, you’ll end up wriggling in your seat, feeling intensely irritated by Michael Peterson all over again. Over on BritBox, an eight-episode, Irish-set gem twinkles in the dramedy gloaming. Created and written by Nancy Harris (responsible for the Bafta-nominated Dates), directed by Paddy Breathnach, The Dry stars Roisin Gallagher (The Fall) as artist Shiv, who returns to her family in Ireland to continue getting over her alcohol addiction. “I’m 35 and I’m not where I thought I would be,” she laments. At first glance it feels like someone put thematic tracing paper over Aisling Bea’s This Way Up – addiction, a squabbling sister (Siobhán Cullen) – but The Dry makes its own way. Shiv tries to own her mess, but she’s not above sulking when people remind her of it. Ciarán Hinds and Pom Boyd are wryly magnificent as her parents. Adam Richardson, as Shiv’s brother, delivers the funniest, angriest gay character since It’s a Sin. Moe Dunford plays a rascally ex, still causing Shiv problems: “Give me a shout when you’re back on the sauce.” Full of wit and bite, The Dry is about addiction and the spectre of relapse, but it’s also about hope, despair and the dead weight of family history. It’s well worth a look. For Oscar Wilde aficionados, there is BBC Four’s one-man play Prisoner C33. Written by Stuart Paterson, directed by Trevor Nunn, it stars Toby Stephens as a kind of dualistic Bogof of Wildes: the broken convict, imprisoned for homosexuality in Reading prison, and his former celebrated self, who appears as an apparition to comfort, goad and inspire him. The horror of the cell conditions is briskly established with an overflowing pail of Wilde’s bodily effluence (survivors of festival portable toilets may find this scene triggering). From there, the two Wildes meditate together on sexuality, persecution, memories, regret, human nature, , with Wilde ultimately discarding “Prisoner C33” to reconnect with his true self. At times his famous epigrams and themes feel rather crowbarred in, but overall Stephens is brilliant: impassioned and affecting. Wilde died just three years after his release from Reading, and Prisoner C33 works almost as a queer reworking of A Christmas Carol: a visitation heralding a vital lesson, but this time for all society. The Terror: Infamy(BBC Two)This is the second outing for the US quasi-supernatural anthology series. The first, starring Jared Harris as a doomed sea captain, evolved into a cult classic. This series focuses on Japanese Americans detained in POW camps after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

5/8/2022,"Welcome to Britain, May 2022 – and one of the most toxic and dangerous economic moments I can recall. Last week, the Bank of England forecast inflation exceeding 10% and predicted negligible growth for the next two years, toppling into months of recession, accompanied by the savage squeeze on living standards. This is serious enough, but less remarked and of as much importance is the 10% devaluation of sterling over the past three months. This is a reaction to the economic trap Britain is in, intensified by the implosion of our EU trade post Brexit and the Brexit-induced fall-away in inward investment. If sterling’s fall continues, the Bank of England’s policy choices will be even grimmer. At the moment, it hopes that interest rates will peak at a manageable 2.5% before inflation starts to fall back to 2% in 2025. But that depends on an end to sterling’s decline. If the Bank has to reassure the financial markets about its determination to contain inflation and staunch the pound’s continuing weakness (why would anyone buy it?), interest rates could yet climb higher. The economy will be forced into deeper recession, with already visible strains in parts of the property market becoming more intense. The markets would be more reassured if it were clear that the government had a strategy, a programme, a plan. The problem: the government is clueless, hanging on to two quasi-religious shibboleths it cannot shed. In its eyes, the hard Brexit it negotiated is a sacred achievement that can imply only opportunity, not crisis. Its faults cannot be acknowledged. Second, Thatcherism has such standing that any purposeful action to address the economy’s weaknesses is deemed “unConservative”. The government’s economic understanding is thus childlike: free markets, low regulation, low taxes, balanced budgets and cheap disposable labour as the alchemy to drive 21st-century economic growth. The uselessness of these attitudes has been in plain sight over recent weeks. Called to brainstorm responses to the cost of living crisis, ministers suggested enlarging the number of children carers can look after, urging people to claim benefits for which they are entitled and making MOT tests biennial. Really? Meanwhile, checks on EU-imported products at our borders are to be deferred until the end of 2023 with no reciprocal relaxation of UK exports to the EU. To ram home our weakness, Boris Johnson was reduced to pleading with Softbank, the owner of our hi-tech jewel Arm, to float the company in London rather than New York. This is the $40bn acquisition made weeks after Brexit to Tory and Brexiter applause, a sign that Britain remained “open for business”. Those of us who warned it was opportunistic asset-stripping and Softbank’s promises worthless were dismissed as Remoaners over-attached to Project Fear. Expect Arm to float in New York rather than in diminished Brexit London. Brexit Tories neither understand modern capitalism nor how to manage it. Ensuring that inflation does not become self-feeding and entrenched requires more than interest rate hikes and boosterish bluster. The markets need to see a confidence-creating plan to restore economic growth, animating investment and productivity. The working population need to know the government will have their back to protect living standards for the duration of the cost-of-living crisis, thus heading off aggression over wage claims that could trigger a wage price spiral. There is neither. While the new German government is vigorously pursuing a twin-track strategy of driving to net zero and creating a new digital economy that impresses the markets, we possess nothing. Levelling up, creating globally competitive cities in every region and nation, could have been such a strategy, one that plausibly could double GDP over a generation. It should be made front and centre of the government’s economic policy, along with a drive to net zero. Instead, it was vetoed by the chancellor holding on to his piggy bank to protect tax cuts in 2024. Nor is there any strategy on the cost of living. There is more than enough scope, even before windfall taxes. The Office for Budget Responsibility projects that in three years the government will have exceeded its target of a balanced budget by £31bn. The chancellor could make a targeted annual cash payment of £500 to each of the 10m hard-hit households reliant on benefits to absolve them of the choice between food, heat and clothes. If he had to do it for the rest of this parliament, the total bill would be £10bn – comfortably affordable and allowing millions to breathe more easily. The industrial strategy should be revived and renewed, but focused on the new economy of “intangibles” where intellectual property, knowledge, digitisation, brands and human capital are king. We need to build institutions ranging from a smarter competition authority to better banks, and investors who get the intangible revolution – and how to drive it on. Reality must prevail about where economic opportunity lies. Modern economies are densely interrelated, with supply chains that cross borders. Britain has too few corporate “primes” that lead their sector, but it does have lots of medium-size companies whose business is being part of a wider supply chain. Membership of the single market with common regulatory standards used to make that easy. Now, as Ulrich Hoppe, director general of the German-British Chamber of Commerce said last week, Brexit Britain is being cut out of these supply chains because the hassle of meeting common standards is too great. Out of the EU and strategy-free, deindustrialisation is accelerating across the Midlands and north. Yet presiding over this is a directionless government, fiercely protected by its press, whose sole purpose has become maintaining the prime minister in office. Rather than address these weaknesses, future parliamentary time is to be consecrated to pursuing its vendetta against Channel 4 and the BBC. Those whom the gods would destroy, to coin a phrase, they first make mad.  Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The economy is collapsing. Yet I can’t recall a government so devoid of a plan | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/08/the-economy-is-collapsing-yet-i-cant-recall-a-government-so-devoid-of-a-plan
5/8/2022,"Government plans to privatise Channel 4 are wide open to being challenged in court because they would undermine Boris Johnson’s commitment to “levelling up” the country, the head of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership has said. Henri Murison, director of the NPP, whose chair is former Tory chancellor George Osborne, said on Saturday two bills to be announced for the next session of parliament in this week’s Queen’s speech – one on the privatisation proposals, and another requiring that all government policies contribute to “levelling up” – were completely at loggerheads and “utterly incoherent”. Ministers face a mounting Tory rebellion in parliament over the plans, which were not in the 2019 manifesto, from peers and dozens of MPs who think the government is wasting time on a policy that they believe will do more harm than good. Channel 4 was set up during Margaret Thatcher’s time as PM to encourage the growth of small production companies outside London and the south-east. It is committed not to produce its own programmes, but instead commission them from more than 300 independent production companies across the UK, many of them in the north of England. Last year Channel 4 opened a new HQ for about 200 staff in Leeds and now aims to increase the proportion of its spending on commissions to companies in the UK’s nations and regions to at least 50% by next year. Murison said culture secretary Nadine Dorries’s plan would fall foul of a new bill drawn up by Michael Gove that will require all policies to pass a levelling-up test to ensure they contribute positively to equalising economic opportunity across the country. “Based on what was in the levelling up white paper, our judgment is that the decision to privatise Channel 4 would not pass that test, and it does not reflect well on officials at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that in advising the secretary of state on her policy they did not think to check that they would be consistent with the other laws they are planning to pass,” he said. There is now an expectation that if ministers press ahead, companies that could lose out from the sell-off could take the government to a judicial review to force a rethink. A consultation on the plans found 96% of respondents were opposed. Murison added: “If you were designing a policy to support the independent television sector in areas like the north of England, if Channel 4 did not already exist, you would create it. When government ministers make decisions based on bad advice they shouldn’t be surprised when they are legally challenged. I think it is likely that other interested parties who are going to be disadvantaged will have a strong reason to consider taking legal action. “On the tests of whether it is good or bad for closing the north-south divide, the privatisation of Channel 4 is going to undermine levelling up. It is completely incoherent of government to propose two pieces of legislation that completely contradict each other.” Dorries says Channel 4 needs to be sold off if it is to survive and thrive “in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape”. She recently tweeted that she wanted the broadcaster to retain a “cherished place in British life” but said she felt that UK government ownership was “holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. She added: “I will seek to reinvest the proceeds of the sale into levelling up the creative sector, putting money into independent production and creative skills in priority parts of the country – delivering a creative dividend for all.” Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: “Channel 4 is a levelling-up broadcaster, commissioning half its programming from creative companies outside the capital, securing a pipeline of creative talent and jobs in the regions and nations. Everyone knows that in selling it off, these commitments would be watered down, and any new owner would need to meet commercial demands, leading to less investment in British jobs and programmes. “That’s why these plans are going to face a rough ride in parliament and could be subject to legal and competition barriers along the way.” Since its launch, Channel 4 has directly invested £12bn in the independent production sector, creating almost £1bn of value for the UK economy in 2019 and supporting more than 10,000 jobs.",News/Media,Channel 4 sell-off ‘will undermine PM’s promise to level up country’,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/08/channel-4-sell-off-will-undermine-pms-promise-to-level-up-country
5/8/2022,"Racists who stole a blue plaque commemorating the death of a British-Nigerian man in Leeds have been “taught a lesson” as citizens overwhelmingly came together to display hundreds of images of the plaque on billboards, video screens and stickers across the city. Leeds was left shaken after the plaque dedicated to David Oluwale, who died in 1969 after being harassed by police, was stolen within hours of being unveiled on Leeds Bridge on Monday. Leeds Civic Trust, which installed the memorial, said the irony of the crime was that the thieves had hugely amplified Oluwale’s name. Mel Roberts, development and engagement manager at the trust, said: “Thank God they stole that plaque because it’s really taught them a lesson, and I think it’s teaching the city an important lesson as well.” She said she had received an outpouring of support on social media and by email, with people asking for stickers and badges to show their support for the #rememberoluwale campaign. An event to mark the installation of the plaque, attended by more than 200 people including the leader of Leeds city council, was held between 5pm and 7pm on Monday – but by 10pm it had been stolen. Emily Zobel Marshall, co-chair of the David Oluwale Memorial Association, said the group had returned from dinner after installing the plaque to find it had been stolen in a “brutally cruel act”. She added: “It’s just been overwhelming the amount of support that the city has shown, and I’ve gone from being so disappointed in the city to feeling a restored sense of faith in it.” Detectives are still investigating the theft, which they are treating as a hate crime, and it is thought to be connected to dozens of incidents of racist graffiti in the city over the last two weeks. A new plaque is being made, funded by the council, and will be installed on the bridge, which was chosen because it was close to where 38-year-old Oluwale was last seen alive, being chased by Sgt Kenneth Kitching and Insp Geoffrey Ellerker. His body was found two weeks later, about a mile away, in the River Aire, which flows under the bridge. In 1971, the two officers were convicted of assault by a jury which had been directed to acquit them of manslaughter. The council agreed to display an image of the plaque on its digital screens in prominent locations around the city, and the advertising company JCDecaux also volunteered its billboards. Other people and organisations began to run with the idea too, including Leeds Playhouse, which displayed the image on a 2-metre-tall billboard at the front of the theatre, and Hyde Park Picture House, a historic cinema, which will show the plaque before its films. Other efforts include a skateboard shop making skateboard stickers and a printing company producing full-scale plaque stickers Zobel Marshall said: “It’s been a real rollercoaster of emotions. The theft shows that things have not changed as much as they need to have changed.” She added: “But wherever the people who took the plaque look, now they will see plaques all over Leeds.”",News/World news,Leeds citizens shame thieves who stole plaque to victim of police racism,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/leeds-citizens-shame-thieves-who-stole-plaque-to-victim-of-police-racism
