12/10/2021,"For Seoul-based graduate Lee Su-bin, the transition to a new lifestyle during the pandemic was no big deal. “At the university library, I would reserve my books online, which would then be sanitised in a book steriliser before being delivered to a locker for pick up,” the 25-year-old says.  “Untact has made many aspects of life so convenient.” Introduced in 2020, “Untact” is a South Korean government policy that aims to spur economic growth by removing layers of human interaction from society. It gathered pace during the pandemic and is expanding rapidly across sectors from healthcare, to business and entertainment. The push to create contactless services is designed increase productivity and cut bureaucracy but has also fuelled concerns over the potential social consequences. Choi‬ Jong-ryul, a sociology professor at Keimyung University, says while there are advantages to developing an untact society, it also threatens social solidarity and may end up isolating individuals. “If more people lose the ‘feeling of contact’ due to lack of face-to-face interaction, society will encounter a fundamental crisis,” Choi says. In everyday life, small changes brought about by untact are becoming increasingly noticeable. Robots brew coffee and bring beverages to tables in cafes. A robotic arm batters fries and chicken to perfection. At Yongin Severance Hospital, Keemi – a 5G-powered disinfection robot – sprays hand sanitiser, checks body temperature, polices social distancing, and even tells people off for not wearing masks. Unmanned or hybrid shops are flourishing. Mobile carrier LG Uplus recently opened several untact phone shops, where customers can compare models, sign contracts and receive the latest smartphones without ever having to deal with a real person. Civil services too are getting untact facelifts. Seoul City plans to build a “metaverse” – a virtual space where users can interact with digital representations of people and objects – and avatars of public officials will resolve complaints. Several local governments have launched AI call bots to monitor the health of those self-isolating. For Covid-19 patients receiving home treatment, a government app also monitors health and gives video access to a doctor. The world of K-pop has also stepped into the metaverse. Fans create avatars where they can “meet” their favourites like Blackpink in a virtual space and receive virtual autographs. Untact in South Korea is more than a buzzword: it represents a potential economic engine for the country. “Untact companies have shown greater growth effects than face-to-face companies in attracting investment and creating jobs,” South Korea’s small business and startups minister Kwon Chil-seung told the Guardian, noting that 12 out of 15 Korean unicorn companies - private firms valued at US$1bn (£750m) or more - use non-face-to-face methods in their primary business. “South Korea has a very strong (communications) infrastructure in the country and many industries based on that infrastructure,” he says, adding that untact is part of a growing global trend that has accelerated in light of the pandemic. His ministry is so serious about the policy that it is pumping 9tn won ($7.6bn) into an “untact growth fund” to find and support 1,200 untact startups by 2025. Many have welcomed the shift. The Seoul Institute found that 80% of residents in the capital who had engaged in non-face-to-face activities said they would continue doing so after the pandemic subsided. Sociologist Choi‬ Jong-ryul says untact provided some advantages - including allowing anonymity through electronic devices, freeing people from the pressures of formality and reducing emotional labour associated with the service industry. The latter problem is particularly acute in South Korea, where customer service is highly valued, hierarchical structures persist, and abusive behaviour by those in positions of power, known as ‘gapjil’, is commonplace. But concerns over feelings of loneliness and social fragmentation remain. The country recently announced plans to invest almost 30bn won ($25.4m) to research a digital treatment platform for depression, a project kickstarted as a result of not having human contact due to the pandemic. Loneliness among elderly people – an existing problem in South Korea only exacerbated by the pandemic - is also receiving the untact treatment. SK Telecom’s AI Care service is among several being deployed across the country that allows seniors living alone to interact with an AI speaker by asking it to play music, have a simple conversation, perform quizzes, or even call for help in an emergency. The system has reportedly reduced loneliness among users, and even been credited with saving lives by the country’s president. “These technologies are not replacing humans. It’s about coexisting with humans,” says SK Telecom spokesperson Irene Kim. Lee Su-bin says while she was comfortable using untact technologies such as unmanned shops, she had concern for others who may “have trouble using them”. “I had to help a grandfather at an automatic kiosk the other day to order his meal,” she says. Kwon acknowledges challenges exist regarding those who might be left behind by the sudden digital transformation brought about by untact, and that his government needs to implement policies and regulations to “strike a balance.” The long-term impact of untact on society remains unclear, but Prof Choi believes an untact future is inevitable to increase economic efficiency. “The key is understanding the social and ethical implications of an untact society and finding ways to maintain social solidarity.” ",News/World news,South Korea cuts human interaction in push to build ‘untact’ society ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/south-korea-cuts-human-interaction-in-push-to-build-untact-society
12/10/2021,"A mass recall of brown sugar in New Zealand, prompted by fears of lead contamination, has left home bakers scrambling for alternatives in the lead up to the festive season, while global supply chain disruptions have caused gaps on the supermarket shelves. The country’s only sugar refinery, NZ Sugar Limited, was forced to make four recalls of its sugar products after low levels of lead were detected in some of its batches. Food Safety New Zealand is investigating the handling of the recall, after three incidents where recalled products ended up back on supermarket shelves.  The company expects it will have sugar back in supply by Christmas, but until then home bakers are having to ditch some of their favourite recipes. Open letter to whoever is in charge: When will brown sugar be back on the shelves? I cannot bake anything in these conditions Morven Walker describes herself as a passionate baker. She has been a regular volunteer for the not-for-profit Good Bitches Baking for three years. Finding brown sugar for her usual recipes is proving a problem. “It’s impossible, it’s just not there,” she said. “It makes a lot of what I’m usually known for – my go-to recipes – difficult.” That includes her Lazy Daisy cake, topped with a grilled icing made with butter and “lots of brown sugar”. Home-bakers are not the only ones affected. Some small bakeries and food-stall operators have informed their customers via social media they will halt production, until the sugar hits the shelves. Meanwhile, large bakeries are offering to portion out their bulk bags and sell small packs to those desperate for a sugar-fix. NZ newspapers publishing recipes that require any kind of brown sugar need to go stand in a corner and consider their life choices. Brown sugar is not the only item shoppers are struggling to get, with reports of cocoa, prunes and, in another blow to Christmas baking, dried fruit being hard to find. New Zealand’s biggest supermarket chain, Countdown, said: “Global freight challenges have been going on for over eighteen months now, which has caused increased wait times and costs to get products to New Zealand. “We’ve done a lot of forward planning, and have brought in early shipments of most of our seasonal Christmas products, which are now ready in stores.” The only item it says it is having ongoing problems getting is cat food. Tava Olsen, the director of supply chain management at the University of Auckland, said trade was “congested and lumpy” at the moment, leading to random shortages of products and making it very hard to predict what shortages will arise. “There have been changes in supply. For example, China shutting down because of Covid outbreaks, LA being congested because of a shortage of truck drivers meaning they can’t unload the cargo. And then there’s the demand side issues, because people’s shopping habits have changed.” New Zealand’s location is also a disadvantage. “We are sort of at the end of it and we’re very small from a global volume perspective. So we’re often not high priority, and our own exporters can sometimes struggle to get products on ships going out,” Olsen said. New Zealanders could expect to see some easing of the supply chain disruption in the next six months, Olsen said, but also an increase in prices. “In terms of the customers experience, it will get better … because stores have been working hard to build their supply chains and ordering things in. Any importer in New Zealand has worked out these lead times are long and unpredictable. But it does add costs.”",News/World news,Brown sugar shortage leaves bitter taste for New Zealand’s home bakers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/brown-sugar-shortage-leaves-bitter-taste-for-new-zealands-home-bakers
12/10/2021,"More than 2,000 people in 60 villages in Papua New Guinea’s north – where the country’s largest gold, copper and silver mine is slated to be built – have filed a human rights complaint with the Australian government against developer PanAust. The landowners of the proposed Frieda River mine, on a tributary to the Sepik in the north of New Guinea island, allege that PanAust failed to obtain their consent.  The coordinator of Project Sepik, Emmanuel Peni, said: “The failure by PanAust and its subsidiary Frieda River Limited to obtain consent from the Sepik River communities violates their right as Indigenous peoples to give their free, prior and informed consent to developments that affect them.” PanAust, 80% shareholder in the project, is an Australian-registered miner ultimately owned by the Chinese government and part of state-owned Guangdong Rising Assets Management. The complaint also alleges that “the proposed mine poses a serious risk for communities living on the Sepik River”. It was filed – on behalf of the affected community members by local organisation Project Sepik Inc and the Australian NGO Jubilee Australia Research Centre – with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Australian National Contact Point. While the complaint does not stop development, Jubilee Australia’s executive director, Dr Luke Fletcher, said he hoped the National Contact Point would assess the validity of the complaint, perhaps looking at PanAust’s environmental impact statement – which the complainants allege does not adequately assess the impact of the project on water catchments – and organising meetings for the company, the NGOs and the Australian and PNG governments to “find a negotiated settlement”. Fletcher said: “Those communities have the right to have their voices heard and to decide what happens on their land. The Sepik River communities have clearly voiced their concerns about this mine, but so far, those concerns have fallen on deaf ears. “PanAust and its subsidiaries must pause all further mine development as all affected communities do not currently consent to the mine.” The proposed 16,000-hectaure mine would be built in one of the most seismically active regions in the world, with an accompanying dam to store 1,500 megatonnes of waste. Government officials, environmental advocacy groups and villagers living along the river have warned that the proposed dam is a potential environmental disaster that could wipe out entire villages if there was a natural disaster. Similar concerns have been raised by 10 UN special rapporteurs, who wrote to the governments of Papua New Guinea, Australia, China, and Canada, as well as the Chinese state-owned developers of the mine, warning that the plan for the largest mine in Papua New Guinea’s history carries a risk of catastrophic loss of life and environmental destruction and “appears to disregard the human rights of those affected”. PanAust says it has conducted “dam break analysis” which ensured “appropriate factors of safety have been incorporated into the design” of the dam. “The probability of a failure is very unlikely,” said the company’s environmental impact statement. “However, the extreme consequences of complete failure leading to the uncontrolled release of large quantities of water and solids (from waste rock and tailings placement) would likely result in extreme downstream environmental and social impacts.” The proposed mine is forecast to yield gold, silver and copper worth an estimated US$1.5bn a year for more than 30 years. In response to detailed questions from the Guardian, a representative for PanAust said the company “politely declines the opportunity to provide comment”. PanAust said in its environmental impact statement that the “nation-building project … presents broad commercial and socioeconomic development opportunities for Papua New Guinea”. The mine plan also includes a hydroelectric plant, power grid, and road, airport and seaport upgrades. PanAust said it had engaged in “extensive and ongoing engagement … over several decades” with those affected by the mine, running information sessions in nearly 140 villages attended by more than 18,000 people. “Local opinions and issues have been sought through engagement campaigns … formal and informal meetings with village leaders, and through socioeconomic surveys conducted in villages between 2010 and 2018.”",News/World news,Villagers file human rights complaint over plan for giant PNG goldmine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/villagers-file-human-rights-complaint-over-plan-for-giant-png-goldmine
12/10/2021,"Children aged five to 11 can be vaccinated against Covid-19 from 10 January, making about 2.3 million additional Australians eligible for the jabs. An independent group of medical, scientific and consumer experts known as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended this age group receive the Pizer vaccine at one-third of the dosage given to those aged 12 years and over. The drug regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has also approved the jab for this age group after reviewing the available evidence.  So what do we know about vaccinating young children, and what happens next? It is true that serious symptoms and complications from Covid-19 in unvaccinated children are extremely rare, and transmission between children in schools is low. But children are highly likely to spread the virus to members of their household if they do become infected, leading to transmission beyond the school. Data published by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance found most children diagnosed with the Delta variant experienced mild or no symptoms, with only 2% requiring hospitalisation. Not all of that 2% were seriously unwell, the report found. Many children were admitted because their parents were seriously ill and in hospital and the children had nowhere to go, with special family wards established in some hospitals to accommodate this. But as older age groups increasingly become vaccinated, school-age children now account for an increasing proportion of cases and hospitalisations overseas, compared with earlier in the pandemic. School outbreaks are becoming more common, and children can spread the virus to those who are vulnerable, including those with weak immune systems who aren’t as strongly protected by vaccination. It is also highly disruptive having to close schools each time an outbreak occurs. According to Unesco, when schools close “the disadvantages are disproportionate for under-privileged learners who tend to have fewer educational opportunities beyond school”. Finally, the higher the proportion of the overall population that is vaccinated, the more rare outbreaks and spread will become and the more vulnerable people will be protected, easing pressure on the health system. Vaccinated people can still catch and spread Covid-19 but their chances of doing so are reduced, particularly after a third booster dose, evidence is showing. Importantly, vaccinated people overwhelmingly experience no, or much less severe, symptoms, with the key goal of vaccination being to prevent hospitalisation and death. Data reviewed by the experts included findings from Pfizer’s clinical trials of the vaccine in children aged five to 11. The trials found a 10 microgram dose (one-third of the standard dose) administered 21 days apart was safe, and led to a strong immune response which was more than 90% effective – similar to the response seen in older people. The Australian regulators and experts also reviewed data from the real world, beyond the pharmaceutical company trials. This is because any very rare side-effects only emerge once millions of people are vaccinated. The experts reviewed data from overseas, including from the US where about 5 million children have received at least one dose. There were concerns after it emerged that some adolescents and young adults, especially males in the 12-to-30 age group, were experiencing myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the outer lining of the heart). But these conditions after vaccinations are rare, and most cases have been mild, with patients recovering quickly. No cases have yet been reported in the five-to-11 age group. Atagi also reviewed clinical data from Canada, prompting the recommendation of an eight-week interval between the two doses for five- to 11-year-olds. This can be shortened to three weeks in special circumstances such as outbreaks, Atagi advised. This is because data shows increasing the interval may increase efficacy, while reducing the already rare myocarditis and pericarditis risk even further. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More common side-effects for children are similar to those experienced by adults, including a sore arm, fatigue and/or headache. Atagi and the TGA will continue to monitor data and can update recommendations if required. Parents, carers and guardians will be able to book January appointments from late December. Vaccines will be made available through general practices, Aboriginal health services, community pharmacies, and state and territory clinics. Individual clinics will determine if they will provide vaccines for children of five to 11, and states and territories will be responsible for any school-based programs. Healthcare providers will be able to order vaccines over the coming weeks. The needle used to administer the vaccine will be smaller than the one for those age 12 and up, and the cap on the vial the vaccine comes in is orange instead of purple and grey to avoid mix-ups. Booster doses are not now recommended for those aged under 18 because the vaccines generate a strong immune response in this group, so the benefit from additional doses of vaccine is likely to be small. There is also only limited data on the safety of additional vaccine doses in this age group.",News/Australia news,Vaccines for Australia’s five- to 11-year-olds: what do we know and how do I book?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/vaccines-for-australias-five-to-11-year-olds-what-do-we-know-and-how-do-i-book
12/10/2021,"You may have never heard of urea, but the worldwide shortage of the chemical compound could bring Australia’s supply chain to its knees in a matter of weeks. The world is facing a major shortage of the compound, a key ingredient found in the diesel ­exhaust fluid AdBlue and a large component in fertiliser.  The main reason for the shortage is that China, which previously supplied 80% of Australia’s urea supplies, has banned export of the product. That’s because the cost of fertiliser has skyrocketed and China wants to slow that price growth. But this could inadvertently force many of Australia’s trucks off the road, as urea is injected into the exhaust systems of modern diesel vehicles to reduce emissions, which is a requirement for trucks, private vehicles and tractors. The shortage could also lead to higher food prices at the register. So what is urea and how badly could the shortage impact Australia’s supply chain? Urea is a handy, naturally occurring chemical compound – CO(NH2)2, also known as carbamide – that is found in mammalian urine, among other places. Since 1828, when the German chemist Friedrich Wohler developed a process to synthesise the compound, urea has also been produced in bulk for human uses. These include as an agricultural fertiliser, but also to reduce nitrous oxides produced in combustion engines. The main feedstock for the world’s urea production is gas, which is first converted to ammonia under high temperatures and pressure, and then into liquid urea. Global urea production is about 220m tonnes a year. According to Volker Hessel, a professor at the University of Adelaide, Australia’s largest producer, Incitec Pivot, has a capacity of about 290,000 tonnes a year, or one-800th of the total. That company told the stock exchange last month it plans to close its main urea plant in Brisbane’s Gibson Island by the end of next year. The facility had been unable to secure “an economically viable long-term gas supply”. Instead, it will rely on its international supply chains to replace the manufactured product, at least until it can determine the viability of making so-called green ammonia using hydrogen at scale as the substitute feedstock for fossil gas. Demand and supply shifts have contrived to push up fertiliser prices by about threefold in a year, according to the World Bank. “High fertiliser prices could exert inflationary pressures on food prices, compounding food security concerns at a time when the Covid pandemic and climate change are making access to food more difficult,” the bank said in a post. Wes Lefroy, a senior agriculture analyst at RaboResearch, says if anything the fertiliser prices were responding at first to a surge in demand for wheat, soya beans and corn. Farmers eyeing high prices for those crops see it as a good bet to toss on more fertiliser to glean higher returns. Economies juiced up for Covid also pushed up demand for gas, while Hurricane Ida – the second-strongest tropical storm on record to come ashore at Louisiana in the US – last August triggered the suspension of key refineries, adding to fertiliser shortages. Big fertiliser producers have also been responding by curbing trade. China, which accounts for about one-10th of urea and one-third of another important farm input of diammonium phosphate, closed off exports until next June to ensure local farmers have enough supply. And Russia has curbed fertiliser exports for six months. It’s not just a worry on the farm. Urea supplies also disrupt the availability of a diesel exhaust fluid – AdBlue is its trade name – a refined additive caught up in the China trade block. The National Road Transport Association is among the groups trying to get action from the Morrison government to secure supplies. The association’s head, Warren Clark, has called for the creation of a taskforce of industry groups to obtain alternatives. While the use of the fluid is meant to reduce production of nitrous oxides, newer diesel engines don’t function well without it. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “In most of the modern diesels, there’s a chemical added to the system called AdBlue,” Clark told the ABC. “A lot of the AdBlue, or the chemical that goes into making it, is imported from China. “The supply of that chemical urea has dried up from China. And hence, there’s now a massive shortage of AdBlue In this country.” “Our industry isn’t the only one that will be affected, but we will be hit first and hardest,” Clark said. “These issues go beyond NatRoad and the trucking industry.” RaboResearch’s Lefroy says Australia imports about 90% of its urea-based fertilisers, and of that about two-thirds comes in between March and July, before they are used on winter crops. “There’s very little urea being traded in Australia at the moment just because we’re in summer,” he said, adding that the pinch, if there is one, won’t be felt until next year. Depending on the soil health, farmers can also turn to other fertiliser if urea is not available or plant crops such as legumes that require less fertiliser to start with. Rabobank’s global research points to fertiliser shortages as just one of several factors pointing to high prices for many farm commodities into 2022. “The prices of grains and oilseeds like wheat and corn, food staples coffee and sugar, and key inputs such as palm oil, will all continue at high prices,” it said in a report last week. “The bank expects many food processors to support any significant drop in prices by extending commercial hedges to historical averages and by stockpiling more, enabling them to weather some of the broader global volatility.” Hessel from the University of Adelaide says the problem underscores the tight interconnections, with the shortage of just one key ingredient affecting the whole supply chain. Eventually, hydrogen offers an alternative to gas as the fuel stock, taking out a significant source of greenhouse gases in the process. “Those plants will take five, six, seven years until they are operational – those plants will be investments of billions [of dollars],” Hessel said. “That is not something you build overnight.”",News/Australia news,"What is urea and AdBlue, and why does a worldwide shortage threaten Australia’s supply chain?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/08/what-is-urea-and-why-does-a-worldwide-shortage-threaten-australias-supply-chain
