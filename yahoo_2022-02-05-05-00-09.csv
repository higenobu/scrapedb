2/5/2022,"A day after the International Olympic Committee tried to claim these Games should be free of politics, the Chinese Communist Party staged an Opening Ceremony draped in dual-track political messaging for audiences both inside China and out that was as loud and clear as the fireworks that lit up the Beijing sky. It was a sign of both Chinese strength in its ability to use the Olympics to spread its narrative and its hidden terror at the truth actually seeping out. It ended with an affront to the sensibilities and a middle finger to much of the world, whose prominent governments — including the United States, India, Great Britain, Australia and Canada — refused to send diplomats to grant this absurdity any measure of legitimacy. The Olympic cauldron was lit — a symbolic moment of prominence — on Friday in Beijing by two Chinese athletes, including Dinigeer Yilamujiang, a cross country skier, who, according to the state-run media, has Uyghur heritage. That choice, a female Uyghur, was a direct shot at outside groups and governments who have condemned China for its treatment against Muslim ethic minorities who mostly reside in the far northwest part of the country. Numerous governments, including the United States, and numerous human rights organizations — Amnesty International and United Nations experts, among them — have concluded China is waging genocide against the Uyghurs after some members of the ethnic group began demanding a measure of cultural independence in 2014. China has denied the allegation and its response was, perhaps, even more direct than imaginable. In a signature moment of the Olympics, with massive audiences both inside the country and around the globe, it sent a Uyghur woman to essentially declare all is good and what you’ve heard isn’t true. Well, that’s the Chinese story, at least. But if the CCP is going to use Dinigeer Yilamujiang as a prop for its story, then let her also serve as a chance for the rest of the world to learn about her people. There is universal consensus among governments, independent groups and international journalists about what is happening in the Xinjiang province. It was reached despite the enormous risks politically, economically or even for security reasons in taking on China. Slavery. Forced sterilization. The imprisonment of perhaps 1 million Uyghurs. Re-education camps. The erasing of culture. Rapes, beatings, mandated abortions, starvations and every other form of torture imaginable. “The evidence is overwhelming,” Williams Nee of the Chinese Human Rights Defenders and a former analyst for Amnesty International told Yahoo Sports. China denies it, but it has also denied the United Nation’s own high commissioner for human rights access to the area. No matter, there are satellite images of the camps, testimony from Uyghurs who escaped as refugees, and reports from independent groups and journalists who snuck in. Everything is geared to making the Uyghurs comply with the Chinese central government and Han culture, even if that means ensuring fewer Uyghurs exist, both now and in the future. The racism is appalling. Any objectors can be used to work the cotton fields so the government can profit off their instance on basic human dignity. The Uyghurs, among others in the region, “face systematic, state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity,” Amnesty International stated in 2021. “It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive numbers of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus,” the report stated. If Chinese president Xi Jinping wants an Olympic torch to say there is nothing to see here, well, let the rest of the world that lives outside of his state-controlled media and internet firewalls take the time to look longer and harder and consider what, in even the smallest of ways, they can do to help. Let this backfire. Let this draw attention to this state-run terrorism. Let this become a global movement. Let this grow so loud that it drowns out the IOC’s pathetic willingness to be used as a propaganda prop this month — an effort complete with a pathetic, humiliating, all but written-by-Beijing-speech from IOC President Thomas Bach, for whom history will forever condemn. “They wanted the IOC to send the message that this wasn’t about politics and then make it all about politics,” Nee said. “They want to show to their own people and the world, especially the Muslim world, an image of ethic unity. But you can’t say everything is fine and not let the United Nations, or anyone else, in to investigate.” Let it extend to other global businesses, organizations and prominent people. Let this be the tipping point. This is why the United States and others engaged in a “diplomatic boycott” of these Games. No U.S. government officials were there to witness, and thus lend credence to, this mass brainwashing. The athletes, who want to be there, will be able to compete. It’s an individual choice, not a government mandate. The fact Dinigeer Yilamujiang lit the cauldron, however, shows that China was stung by the boycott and was angry about the lack of American, British and other dignitaries in Beijing on Friday. It also showed it is concerned about the narrative, its fear about the truth leaking out. A hit dog will bark and China was howling on Friday. It needed, in the biggest way possible, to try to message its own people and those around the world that if they happen to have heard about any trouble with the Uyghurs — if they heard about the rapes and the imprisonments and the torture and the slavery, if the growing noise about these atrocities had reached them — well, it isn’t true. Just look at the happy, healthy, smiling face of Dinigeer Yilamujiang as she fired up that cauldron. Well, the cauldron is lit. Now let the rest of the world follow its glow toward the truth.",World/Yahoo Sports,The 2022 Olympics Opening Ceremony revealed this truth: China has a lot to hide,https://news.yahoo.com/the-2022-olympic-opening-ceremony-revealed-this-truth-china-has-a-lot-to-hide-175017821.html

2/5/2022,"A farmer who wrecked a car parked on his land with a tractor has been cleared of criminal damage after he successfully used the 400-year-old legal principle that “an Englishman’s home is his castle”. Robert Hooper, 57, became an internet sensation in June last year, when a video of him using the spikes on his telehandler to flip a £16,000 Vauxhall Corsa went viral on social media. The hill farmer from Upper Teesdale said he had been forced to take action after he came under attack from a ""strutting and agitated"" shirtless youth, who had refused to move the car from his land. Mr Hooper said he did not call police because he had been burgled eight times and found they were often slow to respond. He went on trial at Durham Crown Court after being charged with dangerous driving and criminal damage. But he was acquitted of all charges after telling the jury: “An Englishman's home is his castle and my castle starts at that front gate."" Michael Rawlinson, his barrister, told the court that the origins of the phrase could be traced back to 1604, when Sir Edward Coke was the attorney general of England. ""This whole case is about an Englishman's home being his castle and his right to lawful self-defence of himself and his property,"" explained Mr Rawlinson. In an early 17th century ruling, known as Semayne's case, Sir Edward stated: “The house of every one is to him as his castle and fortress as well for defence against injury and violence, as for his repose. ""If theeves [sic] come to a man’s house to rob him, or murder, and the owner or his servants kill any of the theeves in defence of himself and his house, it is no felony, and he shall lose nothing."" The case against Mr Hooper also became a town versus country debate, with the farmer and his neighbours railing against people who had used their isolated, rural community as a playground during lockdown. The court heard how Elliott Johnson and Charlie Burn, his passenger, had parked the Vauxhall Corsa on Mr Hooper's land when the vehicle suffered a double blow-out. They were making their way home to Tyneside after spending the day at Low Force waterfall with five friends. Mr Hooper, who had been sillaging and bailing, drove down to speak to the driver to explain the car was blocking access to his field. He told the court: ""I said: 'Now then lads, can we have this car moved, I need to be in and out.' ""Instantly, Burns was right in my face. Throughout Covid we'd been two metres from people and here he was five inches from my nose. He was on edge and agitated and full of himself. ""I asked him politely again: 'Can we have this car moved?' and he said: 'I'm not f—--g moving this car. “With that he punched me in the face, which rather shocked me. I said I was only asking him to move the car. "" Fearful that they might have weapons, Mr Hooper said he then climbed into his telehandler and, using the forks, picked up the back of the car and pushed it onto the road. However, the car clipped a post of the farm gate and flipped over, causing massive damage. A video of the incident was uploaded to social media and quickly went viral. Driver has blocked farm gate with his car.Motorist has smartphone. Farmer has forklift. Who's gonna win this one? pic.twitter.com/NpLbGDuxR7 — Jeremy Vine (@theJeremyVine) June 7, 2021 Mr Hooper said he and his neighbours in Upper Teesdale had been plagued by anti-social behaviour during lockdown, with an influx of tourists. He said: “There has been anti-social behaviour, drug-taking, people lighting fires, knocking walls down and blocking the roads with parking, causing a threat to people as well."" Jacky Meeson, his neighbour, who was also called to give evidence, said: “Our area became very popular because of the rivers and countryside and hordes of people came out who were not used to being in the countryside but wanted some freedom. ""With that came a lack of respect for the countryside and the people who live there. There was a general feeling of being invaded by something we were not used to."" Mr Hooper denied dangerous driving and criminal damage and argued that he had been acting in self-defence. Surrounded by a dozen of his friends and neighbours, Mr Hooper hugged Karen Henderson, his partner of six years, as the verdict was delivered. Speaking outside court, Ms Henderson said: “The support of his local community and also people from afar has kept him going through these last eight months of hell, which have been terrible. ""The whole thing has been such an ordeal for him, he's not someone who likes to be the centre of attention so this has been difficult. ""It's been wonderful to see so many people from the Dales come to support him, that really means a lot."" William Wearmouth, a 66-year-old farmer who was also one of those who made the journey to court from Upper Teesdale, said: “Robert Hooper is a decent, honest man, the hardest working man in the Dale and the jury got it right. ""He did nothing wrong, he was under attack and he did what he had to do to protect himself and his property. ""Since lockdown, the Dale has been deluged by people who visit and don't really understand the country.

2/5/2022,"A Central Florida middle school teacher was arrested after being accused of kissing a student in class. Carlos Aguirre Rendon, a math teacher at Deltona Middle School in Deltona, is accused of kissing a 15-year-old student. After a weeks-long investigation, the 29-year-old was taken into custody Wednesday and charged with two felonies, lewd or lascivious conduct and witness tampering. According to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office, deputies opened the case Jan. 11, when it was reported that Aguirre kissed a student on the lips in his classroom. It’s unclear if class was in session at the time. Before that, the teen’s parents had reported concerns to the sheriff’s office. The mother said she’d seen Aguirre put his arm around her daughter at a park. According to interviews with witnesses, “Aguirre often sought to be alone with the victim and appeared to be pursuing a relationship with her outside of normal teacher-student contact,” according to the sheriff’s office. The day before the arrest, deputies learned that Aguirre had been approaching potential witnesses at a park, asking about the student and telling at least one person “not to talk to the police.” Aguirre, booked into the Volusia County Jail under the name Carlos A. Rendon, posted $12,500 bond and was released Wednesday night.

2/5/2022,"It was a reasonable question. On Thursday, State Department spokesman Ned Price went before reporters and announced the United States has evidence that Russia was planning a ""false flag"" attack by Ukrainians to justify an invasion of Ukraine. Associated Press writer Matt Lee asked the obvious, necessary follow-up question: What's your evidence for that? Things got testy. ""If you doubt the credibility of the U.S. government, of the British government, of other governments and want to, you know, find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do,"" Price ultimately said, after a tense back-and-forth. It was a non-responsive answer — and smacked more than a little bit of McCarthy Era red-baiting. You don't trust what we're saying? Maybe you believe the bad guys, huh? But this kind of thing is becoming routine in the Biden Administration. Also on Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki pushed back on a question about civilian casualties in the U.S. raid that killed ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The U.S. alleged al-Qurayashi had detonated a bomb that killed the innocents; a reporter again pressed for evidence of the claim. ""And ISIS is providing accurate information?"" Psaki shot back. This came a few days after she accused Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) of parroting ""Russian talking points"" by opposing NATO membership for Ukraine. Let's be clear: When it comes to matters of war and rumors of war, the U.S. government has very little credibility. The tidal wave of misinformation that led to the Iraq War is the most obvious modern example, but it's far from the only one. Just last fall, military leaders called a Kabul drone strike a ""righteous"" attack on a terrorist — only to later concede a family of 10 had been killed. Former President Donald Trump's rationale for the assassination of an Iranian leader in 2020 ended up looking pretty flimsy, too. This kind of thing happens all the time. No matter which party is running the government, U.S. officials don't get to use the ""trust us"" arguments on matters of life and death, ever. It's also an old, ugly tactic to suggest reporters' sympathies and trust might be more aligned with America's rivals and enemies — a trick that's a step removed, at best, from Trump's much-decried attacks on journalists as ""enemies of the people."" It's easy to lob accusations at critics and questioners rather than answer uncomfortable queries, and it's not better or more defensible when a Democratic administration does it. Even in the best of times, politicians and governments will have prickly relationships with the media. That's fine, and even desirable. But red-baiting from high officials is never acceptable.

2/5/2022,"Four members of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Capitol riot are “devastated for our democracy” after CNN president Jeff Zucker announced his resignation earlier this week, according to a CNN correspondent. Zucker stepped down on Wednesday after acknowledging that he had failed to disclose a romantic relationship with CNN executive vice president and chief marketing officer Allison Gollust. “As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker wrote in a memo to staff. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong.” During a 90-minute meeting with Jason Kilar, chief executive of CNN’s parent firm, WarnerMedia, staffers from the cable news channel’s Washington bureau went to bat for Zucker and expressed concern over the future of the company, according to an audio recording obtained by the Los Angeles Times. “I think we’ve heard a lot of corporate double talk,” said Washington correspondent Jamie Gangel. “I think the company has made a terrible mistake by doing this.” Gangel, who has worked with Zucker since her early days as an up-and-coming producer at NBC, said she received calls from four members of the nine-person congressional panel investigating the Capitol riot “who felt devastated for our democracy” now that Zucker has left CNN. “I do not think you have any appreciation for what you’ve done to this organization,” she said. The committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans: Representatives Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.), Elaine Luria (D., Va.), Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.), Stephanie Murphy (D., Fla.), Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), Liz Cheney (R., Wy.) and Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.) During Wednesday’s meeting with Kilar, CNN Washington correspondent Jim Acosta claimed that without Zucker’s leadership during the Trump administration “we would have probably been taken out and you would have something like Fox News lite on the air right now,” according to the report. “It’s a rather delicate time, not just for this country but this business,” he added. Meanwhile, anchor Jake Tapper said the network would have turned into “benign, vanilla gruel” without Zucker. Tapper went on to claim that WarnerMedia was caving to disgraced anchor Chris Cuomo, who has promised to retaliate against Zucker for firing him without pay, the report says. Cuomo is likely to pursue legal action over his compensation, an estimated $6 million annually, according to the report. “He threatened,” Tapper said. “Jeff said we don’t negotiate with terrorists. Chris blew the place up. How do we get past that perception that this is the bad guy winning?” CNN fired Cuomo in December over his involvement in advising his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on how to handle nearly a dozen sexual harassment allegations. Zucker had supported Cuomo for months before the anchor was finally let go following the release of documents by the New York State attorney general showing that Cuomo had leaned on contacts in the media business to help his brother navigate his sexual-harassment scandal. CNN reportedly learned of a sexual misconduct allegation against Chris Cuomo by a former junior colleague at another network days before it fired the anchor, though Cuomo has denied the allegation. For her part, Gollust, who served as a communications director for Andrew Cuomo for just four months in 2012 and 2013 before quitting to join CNN, said Wednesday she plans to remain in her role at the company. “Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,” she wrote. “Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.” Jeff Zucker Resigns as President of CNN after Failing to Disclose Romantic Relationship with Colleague CNN Ratings Plummet 80 Percent to Start 2022 Chris Cuomo Distances Himself from Brother’s Scandal in Return to Air: ‘I’m Not an Adviser’",Politics/National Review,January 6 Committee Lawmakers ‘Devastated’ by Jeff Zucker’s Ouster from CNN,https://news.yahoo.com/january-6-committee-lawmakers-devastated-170857653.html
2/5/2022,"By Luc Cohen NEW YORK (Reuters) - The jury in U.S. lawyer Michael Avenatti's fraud trial on Friday asked the judge overseeing the case to ""please help us"" deal with one member of the 12-person panel they said was refusing to deliberate based on the evidence in the case. Prosecutors say Avenatti, 50, embezzled nearly $300,000 in book proceeds intended for his former client, the porn star Stormy Daniels. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and identity theft. ""We have one juror who is refusing to look at evidence and is acting on a feeling,"" the jury said in a note to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman. ""She does not believe she needs to prove her side using evidence and refuses to show us how she has come to her conclusion...please help us move forward."" It was not clear whether the juror in question was leaning toward convicting or acquitting Avenatti. The jury began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon in Manhattan federal court, and on Thursday said it was struggling to reach consensus. Avenatti, who is representing himself in the case, requested a mistrial after Furman read the note in open court without the jury present. Prosecutors asked Furman to inquire as to the juror's identity, evaluate the situation, and potentially dismiss the juror. Furman instructed the jury to continue deliberating, reminding them that their verdict must be based on the evidence, or lack thereof, presented at trial, and that they should not be ""swayed by sympathy or emotion."" Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, is known for receiving $130,000 in hush money from then-U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in exchange for keeping quiet ahead of the 2016 election about sexual encounters she says she had with Trump, who denies they took place. Avenatti successfully represented Daniels, 42, in her lawsuit against Trump to free herself from a non-disclosure agreement. He has downplayed the charges against him by arguing the dispute amounts to a disagreement over legal fees and has no place in criminal court. He could be sentenced to up to 22 years in prison if convicted on the charges related to Daniels, which are among a slew of accusations that have ended Avenatti's career as a lawyer. Avenatti is appealing a conviction and a 2-1/2-year prison sentence for extorting Nike Inc, and faces dozens of charges in California that he cheated other clients and committed bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud and tax fraud.

2/5/2022,"Liz Cheney was long ago excommunicated by the Wyoming Republican Party for the crime of suggesting that maybe January 6 was a bit of a problem. Her counterpart among the House Republican caucus's Lone Dissenters, Adam Kinzinger, was censured by an Illinois county Republican group in February 2021, less than a month after those tourists toured the Capitol like the Visigoths toured Rome. And now both Cheney and Kinzinger are turning to face the wrath of the national Republican Party, which took less than a year to gather itself fully behind the notion that January 6 was no big deal and also all the really bad shit was done by antifa, or whatever. Stop asking questions, shut up. The truly remarkable stuff lies in the nature of this draft resolution from the Republican National Committee intending to censure the two, who again have merely joined Democrats in saying that a president should not try to seize a second term by force in contravention of the expressed will of the American people. The resolution is reportedly the work of David Bossie, a committeeman with a storied ratfucking career who was Donald Trump's deputy campaign manager in 2016, and Ronna Romney McDaniel, the RNC chair who has dropped her middle name in the last few years as it went from an asset to an albatross within Republican politics. Yes, McDaniel is Senator Mitt Romney's niece, which makes her uncle's statement on the resolution Friday all the more striking: Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol. Honor attaches to Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for seeking truth even when doing so comes at great personal cost. You hate to see an autogolpe tear a family apart. But the text of the draft resolution itself is worth taking a gander at, if only because it points towards the sorry state of the Republican Party at this juncture. It is such a stream of grievance and conspiratorial nonsense that one can't help but wonder if it was dictated by one person in particular. WHEREAS, The primary mission of the Republican Party is to elect Republicans who support the United States Constitution and share our values; WHEREAS, The Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress have embarked on a systematic effort to replace liberty with socialism; eliminate border security in favor of lawless, open borders; create record inflation designed to steal the American dream from our children and grandchildren; neuter our national defense and a peace through strength foreign policy; replace President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” with incompetence and illegal mandates; and destroy America’s economy with the Green New Deal; Sorry, what does this have to do with January 6? Ah, it's an explicit detailing of the reactionary justification: the people who won the election are bad, so we are justified in doing anything to take power back from them. Nothing else matters. When well-known radical socialist Joe Biden is purposefully creating inflation—don't think about it too hard—you might just have to shitcan the whole American experiment to stop him. Or at least refuse to acknowledge previous forays into that territory in order to give yourself a better chance of winning back the House. WHEREAS, Winning back the majority in Congress, including the United States House of Representatives, in 2022 must be the primary goal of the House Republican Conference (“Conference”) and requires all Republicans working together to accomplish the same... WHEREAS, The Conference must not be sabotaged by Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger who have demonstrated, with actions and words, that they support Democrat efforts to destroy President Trump more than they support winning back a Republican majority in 2022; ""Sabotage"" and ""destroy"" are really the key words here, even if the resolution goes on to lay out the boilerplate right-wing complaints about the January 6 committee. (Also, the telltale use of ""Democrat"" as an adjective, a pure symptom of right-wing talk-radio brainworms.) What matters is that the committee is bad for Trump, which he is seeking to make synonymous with ""bad for the Republican Party."" That Republicans are now looking to go on record with their belief that a full accounting of the events of January 6 is bad for their party ought to tell its own story. But then we reach the thrilling crescendo: WHEREAS, Representatives Cheney and Kinzinger are participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse, and they are both utilizing their past professed political affiliation to mask Democrat abuse of prosecutorial power for partisan purposes, therefore, be it RESOLVED, That the Republican National Committee hereby formally censures Representatives Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and shall immediately cease any and all support of them as members of the Republican Party... Hold up a second: January 6 was just ordinary citizens engaging in some discourse? That is enlightening to know. Whomst among us has not chanted about lynching the sitting Vice President of the United States while engaging in a bit of discourse? When discussing whether the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates to combat inflation, I routinely find myself bear-spraying cops and smearing shit in the halls of the national legislature. This lines up with Donald Trump's new line that the street thugs of January 6 were actually Very Fine People he intends to pardon, the message being that other people who use lawlessness to advance his political ambitions will be similarly rewarded. Meanwhile, the committee has spent a lot of its time interviewing high-powered politicos, not ""ordinary citizens,"" and nobody stays ordinary for long when they attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power in the goddamned United States of America. These people had the unmitigated gall to kick off this little resolution with talk of the United States Constitution. They wipe their ass with the Constitution. If it's not useful to their ends, it's an inconvenience. Anyone who votes in favor of this should be ostracized from polite society for the rest of their lives. But shame is dead. Shamelessness is a superpower. They'll rake in the donations, including from the same corporations who bravely abstained on principle for a few months, and probably win back control of Congress. At which point these Democrat attempts to persecute ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse will be finished for good. So, too, will Kinzinger and Cheney, along with any realistic hope that one of our two major political parties will pull itself back from the authoritarian abyss.

2/5/2022,"LONDON (AP) — Queen Elizabeth II was interrupted by a canine gate-crasher as she viewed mementoes from her reign ahead of the 70th anniversary of her ascension to the throne. While the monarch inspected the memorabilia, including cards and artwork sent in by children and other members of the public to congratulate her on earlier anniversaries, one of her dogs trotted into the room at Windsor Castle.

I know what you want,” the queen chirped as Candy came over. The event was held two weeks ago but announced by the palace on Friday ahead of the milestone on Sunday. Elizabeth has three dogs.
