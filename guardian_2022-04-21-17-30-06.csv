4/21/2022,"Vladimir Putin has ordered his forces not to storm the last remaining Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged city of Mariupol, after his defence minister admitted that the Russian army was still fighting thousands of Ukrainian troops there. Putin described a plan to storm the Azovstal steelworks “impractical” and called instead for Russian troops to blockade the area “so that a fly can’t get through”. The declaration came during a meeting at the Kremlin, where the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, presented a report to Putin about the closely watched battle for the Ukrainian port city and claimed that the city had been “liberated”, although fighting was ongoing. He said it would take several more days for the Russians to defeat the Ukrainians fighting at the steelworks, a sprawling mass of tunnels and workshops spread over four square miles in the south-east of the city. The meeting appeared to be orchestrated in order for the Russians to step back from the assault on the steelworks, which has been stymied by a fierce Ukrainian resistance and the difficulties of operating in the industrial area. Leaving the plant in Ukrainian hands robs the Russians of the ability to declare complete victory in Mariupol. The city’s capture has strategic and symbolic importance. “This is the case when we have to think, that is, we always have to think, and in this case even more so, about preserving the lives and health of our soldiers and officers,” Putin said. “There is no need to climb into these catacombs and crawl underground through these industrial facilities.” Russian officials including the Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov had claimed that Russian troops would soon overrun the plant and its Ukrainian defenders. “Before lunchtime, or after lunch, Azovstal will be completely under the control of the forces of the Russian Federation,” Kadyrov said on Wednesday. A Ukrainian marine commander fighting in Mariupol said on Wednesday his forces were “maybe facing our last days, if not hours”, as another Russian ultimatum to the remaining Ukrainian troops in the besieged port city to surrender or die expired with no mass capitulation. Yet the Russian government appeared to be reconsidering that plan, as casualties have mounted as forces failed to secure the grounds for weeks.",News/World news,Putin orders blockade of Mariupol steelworks ‘so a fly can’t get through’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/putin-blockade-mariupol-ukraine-forces-steelworks
4/21/2022,"A former SAS soldier who is a witness in the Ben Roberts-Smith defamation trial has told the federal court his legal fees are being paid by the Seven network. The retired soldier, who has been anonymised as Person 5, also revealed under questioning from the Roberts-Smith team on Thursday that he learned the Seven network was footing the bill for his solicitors’ and barristers’ fees on Tuesday. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. The Seven network is owned by billionaire Kerry Stokes, who is footing the legal bill for Roberts-Smith, the general manager of 7Queensland and Seven Brisbane before he stepped down to focus on the trial 12 months ago. A spokesperson for the Seven Network said “the claims the Seven Network are paying the legal fees is not correct”, but did clarify that the soldier witness’s fees were being “reimbursed” by another arm of the Stokes empire. “The fees were reimbursed by ACE the chairman’s private company,” the spokesperson told Guardian Australia. “The chairman felt it was unfair that soldiers were being brought before the inquiry without representation.” Seven declined to answer whether it was bearing the legal costs of any other soldier witnesses called by Roberts-Smith. Person 5 has retained counsel since May 2020. He told the court he only found out who was paying “on Tuesday morning”, the day he began giving evidence. All serving and former soldiers called before this trial are entitled to legal representation paid for by the defence department. Earlier this month Stokes stepped down from his role as chair and member of the Council of the Australian War Memorial after 15 years. Person 5 told the court on Tuesday that no people were found hiding inside a tunnel during a 2009 SAS raid on an Afghan compound called Whiskey 108, contrary to evidence previously given by several soldier witnesses who were on the mission. He said the two men shot dead during the operation were noted by troops on the operation as “EKIA” – enemy killed in action – legitimately engaged and lawfully killed. The Whiskey 108 operation, on 12 April 2009, has emerged as a key contest in the defamation trial brought by Victoria Cross winner Roberts-Smith, with the respondent newspapers alleging as part of their defence that two prisoners were executed by Australian troops during the mission. The defamation trial, brought by Roberts-Smith, resumed in February after more than half a year in abeyance because of Covid travel restrictions and shutdowns.

4/21/2022,"The billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has sold his shares in Netflix at a loss of about $400m (£305m), reversing his bullish position in the streaming giant after it reported an outflow of more than 200,000 subscribers. The New York-based investor bought more than $1bn of Netflix shares in January, despite grim forecasts about the company’s subscription levels. Ackman said at the time that the subsequent drop in the share price had presented an “attractive” opportunity for his Pershing Square fund. But Ackman made a U-turn overnight after shares in the online streaming platform plunged more than 35% in reaction to news that Netflix had lost more than 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of the year and was likely to lose a further 2 million over the next quarter, as customers reviewed subscriptions bought at the height of Covid lockdowns. The share drop wiped about $50bn off of Netflix’s market value. Ackman’s decision to offload the stake is estimated to have resulted in a $400m loss for the Pershing fund. In a letter to investors, Ackman conceded that the losses had knocked returns by four percentage points. “One of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis. That is why we did so here,” Ackman told investors. “While we have a high regard for Netflix’s management and the remarkable company they have built, in light of the enormous operating leverage inherent in the company’s business model, changes in the company’s future subscriber growth can have an outsized impact on our estimate of intrinsic value,” Ackman added. The hedge fund manager acknowledged that Netflix had a strategy to stem the losses, including by going after non-paying customers more aggressively and incorporating advertising into its streaming service. However, he noted that the changes could take at least one to two years to implement. “While we believe these business model changes are sensible, it is extremely difficult to predict their impact on the company’s long-term subscriber growth, future revenues, operating margins, and capital intensity,” Ackman said. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the strategy amounted to “radical changes” at the streaming service. “It will be interesting to see how its biggest shareholders view its chances of executing them with any success or whether it’s back to the drawing board with fresh thinking and potentially fresh leadership.”",News/Media,US hedge fund billionaire sells Netflix stake at huge loss,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/21/us-hedge-fund-billionaire-bill-ackman-sells-netflix-stake-at-huge-loss
4/21/2022,"Nicolas Cage has officially revealed he’s in on the joke – but has that spoiled the joke … if that is the correct word? This is a self-aware action comedy whose title is possibly the funniest bit, riffing on the title of Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being as well as possibly Dave Eggers’s memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. Producer-star Cage plays Nicolas Cage: Hollywood ledge and national treasure (to quote a relevant movie title) now in a midlife crisis, haunted by CGI-doppelganger visions of his angry younger self, no longer booking the big roles and facing a grim future in which, as his agent (Neil Patrick Harris) puts it, he plays the cool gay uncle in a Duplass brothers film. Cage is living in a hotel, estranged from his wife Olivia (a thanklessly unfunny role for Sharon Horgan) and moody teen daughter Addy (Lily Mo Sheen), who hates the movie classics he tries introducing her to. (I was waiting for Addy to declare herself instead a massive fan of movies by the Coppola family. Maybe that would be an in-joke too far.) Cash-strapped Cage is forced to accept a million-dollar appearance fee at the spectacular luxury home of a billionaire plutocrat Javi Gutierrez (Pedro Pascal) who is a besotted superfan. But then the CIA gets word to our hero that Javi is a dangerous cartel gangster and Cage must use his privileged access to bring him down. There are some entertaining meta-touches here, but the entire Gutierrez plot is strained and borderline dull. Pascal isn’t a natural comic and the movie winds up fudging his crucial bad-guy status. As for Cage, this isn’t like Leslie Nielsen sending up his erstwhile straight-lead image for Airplane! and The Naked Gun, nor is it exactly like John Malkovich fabricating a complex fictional self in Being John Malkovich. Cage simply plays Cage in the moderate script he’s been given, in that utterly committed, strangely uncomplicated way that has won the hearts of fans who declare themselves on the right side of the laugh-with/laugh-at dividing line. But Cage has already done a far more interesting postmodern film about the film business – Spike Jonze’s Adaptation, written by Charlie Kaufman, in which Cage gave a far better (dual) performance in a much funnier and better written film as the tormented screenwriter-artist Charlie Kaufman and his middlebrow twin brother Donald. In comparison, this feels lightweight.  The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is released on 22 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent review – Nicolas Cage is Nicolas Cage,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/21/the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent-review-nicolas-cage
4/21/2022,"Speaking on German television in 2018, the liberal political scientist Yascha Mounk remarked that Germany was “embarking on a historically unique experiment – that of turning a monoethnic and monocultural democracy into a multi-ethnic one”. He was immediately deluged with emails from far-rightists who felt his comment corroborated their belief in a conspiracy to eradicate the white race. This might have prompted Mounk to reflect that the “experiment” metaphor, which carries certain negative connotations, was perhaps a less than optimal way to characterise mass migration and its consequences. Instead, he went away and wrote an entire 368-page book organised round this very theme. The Great Experiment promises to show us “how to make diverse democracies work”, but contains very few actual policy proposals. For the most part it’s a mishmash of general principles, political truisms and syrupy platitudes, delivered in a register somewhere between a TED talk and an undergraduate dissertation. Mounk draws on social psychology to tell us what we already know: that, on the one hand, human beings have “a tendency to form in-groups, and discriminate against those who do not belong to them”; on the other, the “intergroup contact hypothesis” suggests people from different backgrounds are more likely to get along if they spend time with one another. The ideal diverse society should be neither “unduly homogenising” nor so fragmentary as to give rise to “cultural separatism”. These underwhelming insights are interspersed with snippets of recent world history – sectarian terrorist attacks in the Middle East; nativist demagogues winning elections in various countries – to remind us of what is at stake. Mounk also delves further into the past, sometimes to bizarre effect. I’m not sure, for example, that multicultural 21st‑century western nations have much to fear from the example of the Lebanese civil war of 1975-90, or that invoking the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918 – to illustrate the inherent fragility of “multi-ethnic empires” – is particularly pertinent. Raising the spectre of internecine violence and societal collapse feels alarmist. This brings us to the central paradox at the heart of The Great Experiment. Mounk is broadly in favour of diversity and has no quarrel with it; he knows that, notwithstanding the gains made by populist politicians in many western nations in recent years, the status quo is not under imminent threat and, despite some friction here and there, the social fabric is bearing up. But in order to position his book as an urgent and relevant intervention, he has to play up the scale of demographic change and its potential impact on social cohesion in the longer run. When he solemnly opines on what needs to happen “for the great experiment to succeed”, there’s a strong implication that “failure” – with all that would entail – is not just a possibility but the default likely outcome if preventive measures are not taken. It’s not quite Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood”, but it does skew the discourse to the right. The author works for the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, so it’s relatively unsurprising that his policy prescriptions are of a distinctly managerial, neoliberal flavour, with an emphasis on equality of opportunity and economic growth. He believes such policies will help us “build a meaningfully shared life”, and thus prevent our descent into racial strife. This is the stuff of election pamphlets. Mounk, who hails from Germany and acquired US citizenship in 2017, cites Barack Obama as his favourite politician, and there is something of Obama’s influence in his airy speechifying: “Much of the world is setting out for uncharted territory”; we need “courage” to “embrace a confident vision of a better future”. In fairness, he does make some good observations along the way. He stresses the importance of protecting members of tight-knit religious communities from coercion within their group, and advocates cultivating a progressive civic patriotism in order to undercut the appeal of ethnic nationalism. He notes that the marginalisation of minorities can have the result that people “feel that their membership in the only club they have ever known will forever remain conditional” – a point illustrated in recent times by the Windrush scandal. But these are slim pickings. The defining feature of The Great Experiment is its vagueness. Mounk deems the “experiment” to have begun “in the past five or six decades”, but his focus alternates between Europe and the United States, which has a far longer history of mass migration. He refers to “the problems now plaguing so many diverse democracies”, but does not care to particularise them; they occur “in many cases” and “many parts of the world”. At several points he threatens to say something interesting about critical race theory and the Black Lives Matter movement, but can’t quite follow through, restricting himself to mealy mouthed references to unnamed members of “academic and activist circles”, among whom it is currently “fashionable” to claim “the United States has not made substantive progress towards equality”. The resort to caricature is telling. Barely a single scholar, writer or activist is cited, let alone rigorously engaged with. Why so reticent? Many liberal and leftwing readers would be receptive to a good-faith, nuanced critique of contemporary identity politics, but it’s not forthcoming here. Who is this book for? Why does it exist? A first-year politics student or Blue Labour thinktanker might conceivably find some use for it, but it has little to offer the informed reader. Publishing houses have been churning out titles on populism ever since the political convulsions of 2016, and not all of them have been illuminating. The better ones have foregrounded the ways in which the nativist surge was bound up in the vagaries of politics and economics – it wasn’t just an inevitable manifestation of primordial chauvinism. Over the past few years it has often been remarked that our so-called culture war is to some extent a publishing phenomenon, driven by clickbait and careerism rather than sincere conviction. This is true, but frothing rightwing columnists aren’t the only ones on the make; liberals, too, are doing their bit to impoverish the discourse.

4/21/2022,"Susan Faye Warren, Nina Stibbe’s self-consciously droll narrator, does her best to juggle her dull older husband Roy, unreliable best friend Norma and an uneventful office job, surveying departmental and marital strife with the same eager yet naive eye that she brings to energetic Norma’s reports of the local dogging scene. Susan’s travails make for pleasant if inessential reading; but if you approach the novel as Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend transposed to the fictional University of Rutland, with the local golf club standing in for the Camorra, bathos takes on an irresistibly comic tinge. An English undergraduate, Susan meets Roy and Norma on the same day, the former when he turns up at the cafe where she’s having breakfast, the latter at her Saturday job at The Pin Cushion, a dressmaker’s supply shop. Norma is clever, strange and compelling, despite her dreadful homemade dresses. Susan is immediately intrigued, but Norma’s mother, co-owner of the shop, warns her off: “I don’t think you and Norma-Jean will be friends.” The pair swiftly bond over Norma’s literary ambitions, but such are the subsequent ups and downs of their friendship that Mother clearly knew best. This may be a more lightweight affair than Reasons to Be Cheerful, which won the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction in 2019, but Stibbe retains her discerning eye for the low-level humour of everyday life. After pregnancy and a golf-themed wedding, Susan moves on from ribbons and fabrics to become an assistant to the vice-chancellor at Rutland (the university’s wildly optimistic motto provides the novel’s title). Her marriage has become slightly strained since she accidentally called out the VC’s name at an “unusually playful moment”: “All I can think is that I somehow got the names ‘Roy’ and ‘Professor Willoughby’ muddled.” Emotional turmoil is played for laughs rather than Neapolitan histrionics. A revelation about Roy’s parentage is misunderstood by Susan as a reference to a pet tortoise; dogging leads to an unfortunate pants-round-the-ankles fatality. Susan only has to glance at another man for cold, aloof Norma to pounce on him, but their alliance prevails, more through Susan’s inertia and limited horizons than anything else. Norma has a Widmerpool-like ability to rise in society, while Susan can only look on in admiration. A final recalibration of the friendship is subtle rather than shocking. Susan may never “astonish the world” but she’s happy to raise a few eyebrows in the village, and perhaps cause a flurry of interdepartmental emails.

4/21/2022,"Do you consider yourself a well-adjusted, functioning adult who enjoys a night of live entertainment? Or are you the type of person who turns up to a comedy gig four Malbecs deep, and decides to sit in the front row to have an in-depth chat with your mate about how bad your boss’s BO is? Maybe you don’t like waiting for a break. Instead, you’d rather stand up and loudly announce you need a wee, making the entire row stand up as you squeeze by, vigorously scratching your backside? At the end of a show, do you use your hands to throw popcorn across the room rather than smacking them together to create a pleasant clapping sound? I’ll be honest, if you’re reading this, then you’re probably not one of those people. I bet you’ve seen a few of them, though, especially if you’ve been to a standup comedy gig recently. Because since we’ve come back after lockdown, it’s become increasingly apparent that a small but noticeable percentage of audience members have forgotten how to behave in public. Last week, I was hosting a gig when a man leapt on to the raised stage and grabbed my top. I jumped back, having no idea what his intentions were. In a split second, I had to choose between laughing it off, telling him off or knocking his block off. It turned out he was trying to check the label on my clothes and thought it was fair game to have a rummage. It was a weird interaction, but I didn’t get “Chris Rock’d” or “Me Too’d”; it wasn’t aggressive or sexually motivated. It falls into the category of “poor audience etiquette”, something which is demonstrably worse now than before the pandemic. The gig before the label-grabbing one had a similar vibe. I had to tell people to stop talking through the comedian’s routine and to stop repeating his punchlines back to him like an annoying parrot, drunk on cider. Even “well-meaning” interruptions are unwelcome (“OMG that’s so funny, my partner snores too!”). I call this “disruptive engagement”, which is annoying and unnecessary even if the sentiment behind it is positive. I reached out to my comedy network to see if anyone else had noticed this change in behaviour. My inbox was soon flooded with messages, with many comics agreeing that things have escalated since the pandemic – from aggressive heckling, to talking over the act, to jumping on stage, and various other examples of being a right pain in the arse. It’s not just comedy; musicians and actors tell similar stories. Sophie Ellis-Bextor has repeatedly had to ask rowdy audience members to pipe down so everyone else can hear the gig they’ve paid to see. Beverley Knight tweeted after a particularly galling incident: “If your intention is to come to the theatre, get rat-arsed, make a scene, disrupt the show … My advice is stay your ass at home.” The worst story I heard was from a visually impaired act, whose cane was snatched by an audience member who shouted: “Are you really blind? How many fingers am I holding up?” The majority of comedy audiences are brilliant, but some idiots ruin the show for the rest, as well as for the performers. It’s like reading a book and ripping out half the pages, except it’s a library book and now no one else can fully enjoy it. So how have we ended up here? Have two years of lockdowns and limited live shows made people forget how to be civilised audience members? Are we so deprived of performance art that we can’t contain our excitement? Do venues need to display reminders that we’re supposed to drink our drinks, not slosh them over the people sat next to us? Partly, yes. I think people are struggling with boundaries. We lived in our own bubbles for so long that we’ve forgotten how to interact and engage with others in an appropriate way. On top of that, there’s something about the nature of comedy that makes people think it’s more interactive than it is. Nor does social media help, with “comedian destroys heckler” clips going viral. Those kind of interactions are rare and they can be funny, but it shouldn’t set the standard for what to expect at a comedy night. You should expect a friendly welcome from the MC, some cracking material from the acts and a good night out. A well-written routine will always be funnier than any off-the-cuff put-down in response to a drunken nuisance. We’ve arrived in a weird place, where some people need to be reminded that it’s only the comedians who require the spotlight. Not them and their mates so they can have a testosterone-off. There’s literally a stage and microphone for that very reason. Whether it’s caused by a lack of social boundaries, pent-up frustration after multiple lockdowns or a cheap deal on blue lagoon cocktail pitchers, wally-like behaviour isn’t acceptable. As an MC, I always start the show with a friendly welcome and a few house rules. Phones on silent, don’t heckle the acts, don’t talk among yourselves while the acts are on stage. Do I now need to add, don’t interrupt the show, don’t manhandle the entertainers, don’t act like a plonker, and never, ever try to examine the act’s labels?
