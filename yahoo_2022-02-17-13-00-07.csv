The Tesla CEO was responding to a retweet about Munger's comments on Wednesday in which he likened cryptocurrency to ""venereal disease."" The 98-year is the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett's right-hand man. In response, Musk — a crypto supporter — tweeted an anecdote.

Tesla is currently the world's most valuable carmaker with a market capitalization of $954.3 billion. Munger had commented about Musk in public before, saying in December that the Tesla and SpaceX CEO ""thinks he's even more able than he is and that's helped him."" ""Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself. Some of the extreme successes are going to come from people who try very extreme things because they're overconfident,"" he continued.

2/17/2022,"An enormous, 58-foot-tall swell that crashed in the waters off British Columbia, Canada, in November 2020 has been confirmed as the largest ""rogue"" wave ever recorded, according to new research. The monster wave, which struck off the coast of Vancouver Island, reached a height roughly equivalent to a four-story building, scientists said. Characteristics of the wave were detailed in a study published Feb. 2 in the journal Scientific Reports. Rogue waves are unusually large swells that occur in open water and grow to more than double the height of other waves in their vicinity. These unpredictable and seemingly random events are sometimes known as ""freak"" or ""killer"" waves, and not much is known about how they form. Johannes Gemmrich, a research scientist at the University of Victoria and the lead author of the study, said that proportional to surrounding waves, the 2020 event was ""likely the most extreme rogue wave ever recorded."" ""Only a few rogue waves in high sea states have been observed directly, and nothing of this magnitude,"" he said in a statement. ""The probability of such an event occurring is once in 1,300 years."" The huge swell was picked up by sensors on a buoy located a little over 4 miles away from Ucluelet, on the western coast of Vancouver Island. For centuries, rogue waves were thought to be nautical myths, dismissed as exaggerated accounts cooked up by mariners on the high seas. In recent decades, however, scientists were able to confirm the existence of rogue waves, though they are still difficult to observe and measure. The first recorded rogue wave occurred off the coast of Norway in 1995. That event, known as the ""Draupner wave,"" reached a height of nearly 84 feet, twice the size of its surrounding waves. Though the 1995 rogue wave was taller overall than the one measured off Ucluelet, the record-breaking 2020 event was nearly three times the size of other waves around it, the researchers said. Studying rogue waves could help scientists better understand the forces behind them, and their potential impacts, said Scott Beatty, CEO of MarineLabs, a research company that operates a network of marine sensors and buoys around North America, including the one that recorded the Ucluelet wave. ""The unpredictability of rogue waves, and the sheer power of these 'walls of water' can make them incredibly dangerous to marine operations and the public,"" he said in a statement. Beatty added that being able to track and analyze these unusual events will improve maritime safety and help protect coastal communities. ""The potential of predicting rogue waves remains an open question,"" he said, ""but our data is helping to better understand when, where and how rogue waves form, and the risks that they pose.""",Science/NBC News,"Once dismissed as mythical, a 60-foot rogue wave swells off British Columbia",https://news.yahoo.com/largest-rogue-wave-ever-observed-224531254.html
2/17/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is set to announce on Thursday that it will ease border controls put in place to counter the spread of the coronavirus, measures that are the strictest among wealthy nations and have been slammed by business leaders and educators. About 150,000 foreign students have been kept out of the country, along with workers desperately needed by an aging nation with a shrinking population, prompting warnings of labour shortages and damage to Japan's international reputation. Japan briefly eased its border rules, which have effectively kept the nation closed to non-residents for two years, late in 2021 but tightened them again just weeks later as the Omicron variant emerged overseas. Among the measures set to be announced will be raising the number of people allowed to enter Japan to 5,000 a day from the current 3,500, according to media reports. Others are likely to include shortening the required quarantine period, currently a week, to three days under certain circumstances, such as the coronavirus risk level in the nation people travel from and whether they are fully vaccinated, including a booster shot. Japan designates 82 nations as ""high risk"" and requires three or six days of mandatory hotel quarantine as part of the week of isolation for many. Two weeks of quarantine were required until mid-January. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is expected to announce the new measures at a news conference on Thursday. They would take effect in stages from March, media reports say. Kishida and his government have hailed the tight border controls for buying Japan time as Omicron surged around the world, and a vast majority of the public supports them. Yet with the variant now widespread in Japan, which is struggling to roll out booster shots, business leaders and some politicians have warned the measures are obsolete. For Kishida, who faces a crucial election in July, deciding when and how to change the measures has been tricky, said political analyst Atsuo Ito. ""If you look at the overall situation now, they're meaningless; you can get the virus anywhere. But as a result of having them, he got a lot of public support,"" he said. If they're not changed, Ito added, ""the result over the long term is that Japan is going to be left behind the rest of the world."" (Reporting by Elaine Lies.
