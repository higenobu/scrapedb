5/10/2022,"Though the novels of Jane Austen positively drip with witticisms, catty descriptive asides and zingy ironies, their film versions all too often tend to soft-sell the comedy. Emma Thompson’s elegant adaptation of Sense and Sensibility was wry and knowing, though only the most hopeful of high-school English teachers would argue for it as genuinely side-splitting; Joe Wright’s take on Pride and Prejudice played up swooning romance over barbed interplay. Both the Paltrow- and Taylor-Joy-starring iterations of Emma are light, pastel-hued baubles, but more feathery than they are genuinely funny; the laughs only came with a rewrite as drastic as Amy Heckerling’s Clueless. Love & Friendship, then, is a delicious rarity: an Austen interpretation taken on by an established, distinctive comic film-maker, bent to his cockeyed sensibility even as it honours the zesty, cutting hilarity of the original text. When it was announced that Whit Stillman was adapting Austen’s relatively obscure, posthumous published novella Lady Susan, the marriage seemed almost too perfectly arranged, even if Stillman is as Waspishly American as Austen was Waspishly English. Known for his ultra-arch, hyper-literate satires of preppy, privileged pockets of east coast society – from his Oscar-nominated debut Metropolitan to his peculiar spin on the campus comedy, Damsels in Distress – Stillman has something of Austen’s gift for smuggling razor-edged observations in silky formalities. To watch him work through her is to make you wonder how prime Preston Sturges or Billy Wilder might have tackled the author. In lieu of such hypotheticals, Love & Friendship will do very nicely indeed. Released six years ago now, it has since acquired the older-feeling patina of easy rewatchability; insufficiently seen and celebrated at the time, it deserves to become a comfort-watching standard. A corset comedy made with a springy screwball sensibility and the darkly venal undertow of Dangerous Liaisons, it is, for my money, the best Jane Austen film made to date. That it achieves this by adapting one of the author’s own least essential works is a testament to Stillman’s resourcefulness as a writer, as well as the general maxim that minor literature is often better served on screen than major. A work of juvenilia, but not published until a half-century after Austen’s death, Lady Susan is an epistolary trifle that differs from her better-known novels in its anti-romantic outlook and cynical preoccupation with bad behaviour gone largely unpunished. Its title character is a gleefully unscrupulous heroine and villainess in one, irresistible in her self-serving wit and cleverness. A young widow striving and seducing her way through the upper classes, she aims to both get the guy and thwart The Man, using her own gormless daughter as a decoy if it gets her closer to the prize. If the book’s letter-based structure revealed Lady Susan’s moral dubiousness first-hand through her caustic, withering tone, Stillman’s film fleshes out a wider world at her feet, warming her up a little in the process. On film, she’s the tastiest of characters – queen bee, black widow and femme fatale, all in fabulous millinery to boot – and a career-crowning role for Kate Beckinsale, who to that point had been languishing in one anonymous B-thriller and Underworld installment after another. Love & Friendship plays on Beckinsale’s signature cut-glass hauteur, but lets her be messy and sexy beneath the serene surface: an English rose with racing sexual energy and an unapologetically dark heart. She has a wicked way with a one-liner, too, lending an Austenite dignity to Stillman’s preppy quippiness: “What a shame you married Mr Johnson,” she observes to her American confidante Alicia, played by Chloe Sevigny with a deadpan drollness that brings some modern slacker energy to these buttoned-up surroundings. “He’s too old to be governable and too young to die.” Men are treated as punchlines throughout Love & Friendship, none more riotously than Sir James Martin, a dim, wealthy patsy who becomes an integral figure in Lady Susan’s social climbing strategy – and who the British character actor Tom Bennett plays with sublime, clockwork-timed idiocy, ensuring that Beckinsale doesn’t get to strut off with the whole film. The London Film Critics’ Circle handed well-deserved prizes to both actors; otherwise, this impeccable comedy of good manners and very bad behaviour went largely unnoticed by awards voters, proving that even highbrow literary adaptations must pay a price for levity. No matter, since the film is already aging beautifully: a Jane Austen film made with palpable love for the source, and a riotous confidence in its own comic voice.

5/10/2022,"More than half of all prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in Australia are written by doctors in Queensland, with prescriptions often given for conditions there is little evidence medicinal cannabis can treat, new research reveals. Medicinal cannabis products such as capsules, creams, oils, lozenges, sprays and granulated flowers were approved for prescription 159,665 times between the start of Australia’s medicinal cannabis program in February 2016 and September 2021, research led by the University of Sydney’s Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics shows. Data obtained through a freedom of information request to drugs regulator the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) revealed the age of those prescribed the drugs, the reason for prescribing, and the state or territory where the prescription was made. Some of this information has since been made publicly available on the TGA’s Medicinal Cannabis Access Data Dashboard – revealing approved medicinal cannabis prescriptions have now reached more than 247,000 – though the data published is not as detailed as that obtained by the researchers. The researchers’ analysis found anxiety was the reason given for 16% of medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Flower-based medicinal cannabis prescriptions for anxiety were most common, despite a lack of high-quality clinical studies showing treatments made from the flower of the cannabis plant are effective for the condition. Pain was the most common reason for medicinal cannabis being prescribed (61% of prescriptions), and 5.7% of prescriptions were for sleep disorders. The data also shows that prior to 2020, people between 45 and 52 years old had the highest incidence of prescriptions. After 2020, those between 20 and 31 years old were the predominant group being prescribed medicinal cannabis. Queensland was the source of 51% of prescriptions between 2016 and 2021. The lead author of the study, Sara MacPhail, said it is unclear why the age demographic had changed, or why so many prescriptions were being made in Queensland. These were findings that need further study, she said. Dr Elizabeth Cairns, a co-author on the paper, said another interesting but unexplained finding was that prescriptions of topical creams containing CBD, a chemical found in cannabis, were being written for convulsions. “This usage has not been extensively explored,” Cairns said. “We are aware of clinical trials in that space, but not strong evidence.” The findings were published on Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Pharmacology. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The use of medicinal cannabis to treat pain is controversial in Australia. The Australian Faculty of Pain Medicine suggests cannabinoid products should not be prescribed to treat chronic non-cancer pain, unless the patient is being treated as part of a registered clinical trial so that better evidence can be gathered. Few studies have been done examining cannabis for the treatment of sleep disorders. “However, both the medical practitioner and the TGA are involved in the prescription and approval of medicinal cannabis under the special access scheme in Australia, so it’s gone through rounds of approval before going to the patient,” Cairns said. “So I think medicinal cannabis is often seen as that last resort when other treatments have failed.” Prof Jennifer Martin, a clinical pharmacologist, physician, and chief investigator with the Australia Centre for Cannabinoid Clinical and Research Excellence, said although doctors may feel they are prescribing as a “last resort”, it can be difficult to say no to a distressed and ill patient. There could be many barriers to patients trying more evidence-based treatments such as multi-disciplinary pain clinics, psychotherapy or exercise programs, she said. “Some of those programs take a real investment from the patient to commit to them over time, and often people can’t get into the programs because there’s a waitlist, or due to cost,” Martin said. She said in New South Wales, the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, had secured government funding for the NSW Cannabis Medicines Advisory Service, which gives advice and evidence-based information to doctors. “A lot of doctors end up not going ahead with the prescription after getting advice from the service,” Martin said. “Sometimes the patient was not aware that medicinal cannabis products could worsen their condition. This might also be why prescriptions are lower in NSW than Queensland.”",News/Australia news,"More than half of prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in Australia given in Queensland, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/more-than-half-of-prescriptions-for-medicinal-cannabis-in-australia-given-in-queensland-study-says
5/10/2022,"A number of Chinese government-linked media outlets and pro-Russia social media accounts are spreading pro-Kremlin sentiment on the Chinese internet by mistranslating or manipulating international news about the war in Ukraine. In response, online, anonymous volunteers – such as those under the Twitter account Great Translation Movement – have exposed China’s pro-Russia propaganda by highlighting mistranslations that falsely blame Ukrainian troops for bombings and atrocities perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians. On 21 April, an article published by the Guardian revealed how civilians, who died during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, were killed by tiny metal arrows called flechettes, from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. However, the South Review, an official state media and subsidiary of the Chinese Communist party, owned by the Guangzhou Daily newspaper group, mistranslated the article, claiming the flechette rounds were fired by Ukrainian forces. In China's EN-CN dictionary, ""Russia"" translates into ""Ukraine."" @guardian @Lorenzo_Tondo, MISTRANSLATION of your article by South Reviews. This is official state media, a subsidiary of the #CCP owned Guangzhou Daily Newspaper Group.#大翻译运动 #TheGreatTranslationMovement pic.twitter.com/pV8vDRbga1 “The UK Guardian published the first postmortem findings of the Bucha incidents: they were caused by Ukraine shelling Bucha,” reads the article from South Review. On Weibo, a military-focused account with more than 4.7 million followers added: “Although the Guardian normally publishes anti-Russian comments, this time the forensic doctor’s report turned out to be the exact opposite.” (When checked by the Guardian on 6 May, the author had since modified this Weibo entry). The apparently mistranslated article caused much controversy even on China’s heavily monitored social media. Many English-speaking users of Weibo pointed out the mistake. On 27 April, China Fact Check, under the Shanghai-based the Paper news website, clarified and said it was “mistranslation”. On other occasions, despite Chinese officials preaching a neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine, pro-Russia social media accounts have manipulated the news coming from the Ukrainian front. For example, on 8 April, in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, two Russian ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station, dropping cluster munitions, killing 59 people and injuring hundreds of passengers. #China response to devastating attack on #Kramatorsk train station.Another evidence that Chinese propaganda machine is shameless & inhumane to accuse #Ukraine army for #Russia's war crimes@Podolyak_M#TheGreatTranslationMovement#大翻译运动#ChinaIsWithRussia#RussiaUkraineWar pic.twitter.com/b6jFwphY92 The same day, a popular military Weibo account with more than 34 million followers falsely claimed the attack was carried out by Ukrainian troops. Towards the end of the entry, the account added a hashtag that suggested US labs in Ukraine were working on eight severely infectious diseases. ‘‘In China’s EN-CN dictionary, Russia translates into Ukraine,” the Great Translation Movement, which has about 150,000 followers, said on Twitter. Born shortly after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Great Translation Movement – a Twitter account and a related hashtag that identifies itself as “fourth estate” and “holds muck-rake in hand, wears crown from gutter” – has been a source for English-language speakers to understand how state-linked Chinese social media discuss the war in Ukraine. The decentralised anonymous group is operated by several hundred volunteers around the world. For security reasons, they say, they do not know geographical locations of fellow contributors. But they were glued together by the same mission: contradicting Beijing’s propaganda and naming and shaming those in China who support Putin’s military adventure in his neighbour. “To put it simply, the context behind everything is the colossal gulf between the different types of messaging that the Chinese government shapes for the rest of the world, versus that of within China,” they said in a written statement. Debates about Russia’s invasion do exist in China, but on social media, which is heavily monitored, views similar to those in the western media are often met with censorship. Anti-western commentators of the events toe a Kremlin line, blaming Nato and the US for what they call “special military actions”. Last month, some Chinese pundits went so far as to question whether the killings in Bucha were a “staged performance”. “[A]fter all, Zelenskiy is an actor doing what actors are trained to do,” said a military commentator on Phoenix TV. A month earlier, the same pundit said Russia’s invasion was “in self-defence” in the face of US pressure. But as the Great Translation Movement began its crusade against pro-Russian misinformation, Chinese state media also launched their own campaign to discredit it. The nationalist tabloid the Global Times, for example, has since March published a number of articles accusing it of being a part of the “anti-China force”. It even compared the account to the anti-communist McCarthyist crusade in 1950s America. “Such a despicable ‘movement’ has a large potential audience, mostly in the west,” wrote one piece on 31 March. “Some of them are novelty-seeking and feel superior on a cultural level. In light of China’s rapid rise and the west’s decline, these people need an illusional superiority to feel better.”",News/World news,China’s pro-Russia propaganda exposed by online activists,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/china-pro-russia-propaganda-exposed-by-online-activists-ukraine
5/10/2022,"Mark Esper was Donald Trump’s second defense secretary. Like James Mattis, his predecessor, he fell from Trump’s grace. Six days after the 2020 election, the 45th president fired him, via Twitter. Unlike Mattis, Esper now delivers a damning tell-all. A Sacred Oath pulls no punches. It depicts Trump as unfit for office and a threat to democracy, a prisoner of wrath, impulse and appetite. Over 752 pages, Esper’s Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times are surgically precise in their score-settling. This is not just another book to be tossed on the pyre of Trump-alumni revenge porn. It is scary and sobering. Esper is a West Point graduate and Gulf war veteran. No one confuses him with Omarosa Manigault Newman, Cliff Simms or Chris Christie. Esper ignores Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway and barely mentions Melania Trump. He is complimentary toward Jared Kushner. In general, Esper disliked what he saw. Trump’s fidelity to process was close to nonexistent, his strategy “narrow and incomplete”, his “manner” coarse and divisive. The ends Trump “often sought rarely survived the ways and means he typically pursued to accomplish them”. The book captures Trump’s rage when advised that Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, lacked command authority over the active-duty and national guard troops Trump wanted to deploy against protesters in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd. “‘You are losers!’ the president unloaded. ‘You are all fucking losers!’” In addition to Esper, Milley and William Barr, the attorney general, Trump also targeted Mike Pence. Esper writes: “He repeated the foul insults again, this time directing his venom at the vice-president as well, who sat quietly, stone-faced, in the chair at the far end of the semi-circle closest to the Rose Garden. “I never saw him yell at the vice-president before, so this really caught my attention.” Esper explains why he didn’t resign: “I didn’t think it was the right thing to do for our country.” His wife, Leah, framed it this way: “As your wife, please quit. As an American citizen, please stay.” The government attempted to censor A Sacred Oath, as it did The Room Where It Happened, a memoir by John Bolton, Trump’s third national security adviser. Fortunately, the powers that be buckled after Esper filed suit in federal court. Here and there, words are blacked out. The core of the story remains. At one point, Trump proposed launching “missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs”. The then-president said: “No one would know it was us.” He would simply deny responsibility. Esper looked at Trump. He was not joking. According to reports, the censors found this inflammatory. They did not, however, deny its veracity. Confronted with the story, Trump issued a “no comment”. Donald Trump Jr asked if his father’s scheme was “a bad thing”. Hunter Biden isn’t the only troublesome first son. Trump’s reliance on underlings who put their boss ahead of country distressed Esper too. Mark Meadows, Stephen Miller, Robert O’Brien and Ric Grenell all receive attention. Little is good. Esper found their bellicosity grating. After a meeting with Trump’s national security council, Esper commented to Milley about its lack of military experience and eagerness for war with Iran. “We couldn’t help but note … the irony that only two persons in the room that had ever gone to war were the ones least willing to risk doing so now.” Esper offers a full-throated defense of Trump’s decision to kill Qassem Suleimani. The Iranian general had American blood on his hands and was planning an attack on US diplomats and military personnel. Esper also writes about the state of the union. “I was worried for our democracy,” he says. “I had seen many red flags, many warnings, and many inconsistencies. But now we seemed on the verge of crossing a dark red line.” In the summer of 2020, the unrest that followed the murder of Floyd transported Trump to a Stygian realm. In the run-up to the election, Esper feared Trump would seek to use the military to stay in office. Esper met Milley and Gen Daniel Hokanson, the general in charge of the national guard, in an attempt to avert that outcome. “The essence of democracy was free and fair elections, followed by the peaceful transition of power,” Esper writes. Ultimately, Trump did not rely on the military to negate election results – a path advocated by Mike Flynn, his first national security adviser. Instead, the drama played out slowly. By early January 2021, Milley was telling aides the US was facing a “Reichstag moment” as Trump preached “the gospel of the führer”. On 6 January, Trump and his minions unleashed the insurrection. “It was the worst attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812,” Esper writes. “And maybe the worst assault on our democracy since the civil war.” Yet Trump and Trumpism remain firmly in the ascendant. In Ohio, in a crucial Senate primary, Trump’s endorsement of JD Vance proved decisive. In Pennsylvania, his support for Mehmet Oz may prove vital too. Down in Georgia, Herschel Walker, Trump’s choice, is on a glide path to nomination. Walker’s run-ins with domestic violence and death threats pose no problem for the faithful. Even Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, has bought in. Days ago, Esper told the New York Times Trump was “an unprincipled person who, given his self-interest, should not be in the position of public service”. Most Republicans remain unmoved. Esper is only an author. Trump spearheads a movement.

5/10/2022,"Iremember opening for the Who towards the end of my time in the Ordinary Boys, the band with whom I enjoyed brief fame in the 00s. Roger Daltrey, then in his late 60s, sang, apparently without irony: “I hope I die before I get old.” It made me think: “What’s next? Maybe I could find a nice job in advertising.” It’s a question that almost every performer faces in an industry that fetishises youth: is it better to burn out or just fade away? And then what? Where do you go? What do you do? How do you move on? These are the questions Nick Duerden poses in his new book, Exit Stage Left. Each chapter serves as a condensed musical biography. The opener is a sensitive account of the life and career of Peter Perrett of the Only Ones, whose 1978 release Another Girl, Another Planet is one of punk’s great pop songs. But “artists really aren’t the best people to operate the heavy machinery of adulthood” and a regrettable incident in a car park in California while supporting the Who (them again) had them thrown off the tour and sent back to England, where he spent the next couple of decades struggling with substance dependency. There’s a redemptive arc in Perrett’s story and it’s incredibly moving to read. Blistering first acts share the same energy: the big break, the world tours. But here are fading encores, empty assembly rooms, silence. As Tony James asked himself after Sigue Sigue Sputnik failed to deliver on their second album: “Do I crawl away and die now? Or do I do something else?” The book isn’t all punk and indie stars, or redemptive arcs for that matter. What of those pop artists who reached their successes within parameters chosen for them by the Simon Cowells of this world? There is the story of pop R&B band Damage, whose skin colour saw songs intended for them being handed to the likes of Westlife and Boyzone, who the industry decided were more marketable. One of the hardest sections to read is the tragicomic tale of Paul Cattermole from S Club 7. This time, Duerden skips the origin story and we hard-cut to washed-up Cattermole being prodded by the Loose Women on daytime television where “a ticker-tape banner at the bottom of the screen reads ‘I’m Broke’”. Most of the stories are cautionary tales. If there is one takeaway for how to survive a career in pop music it seems to be “buy a house in London in the early 80s”. Or perhaps try not to do too many drugs. Spending my formative years in the dizzying plastic reality of my own stint of pop stardom left me wholly ill-equipped to navigate the real world afterwards. Being micromanaged for so long by agents who then disappeared overnight was a lonely experience. I made a conscious decision to end my celebrity career when I suspected that decision was not far from being made for me. This didn’t make the change any less jarring. I told my bandmates that I was quitting the band, packed a bag and bought a one-way plane ticket to Philadelphia. I remember walking past a magazine rack lined with front-page stories about my divorce as I boarded. I stayed away for three years. But if a career in pop music is so often about managed decline, what is wrong with gracefully managing that decline? Why is a band touring in smaller venues than they had previously played or selling fewer records than they did in their early 20s met with such ridicule and contempt? Allan “Boff” Whalley from Chumbawamba, who retired from the band aged 51, puts it like this: “The bands I loved, when they split up, I always thought it was a beautiful thing. And those bands that I loved who then got back together – well, it never felt right.” One fact emerges clearly from every story in Exit Stage Left: there is an unshakable identity that crystallises in anyone who has had any pop success. No matter what I do with my life I will always be Preston from the Ordinary Boys. It is that burnt-on identity that is at the heart of this book. It’s the “from” that follows the name of every interviewee. I now split my time between LA and London writing songs for other artists. I have a house in London and a trickle of royalties. I do have occasional pangs of regret. And I’m certain I will at some point ill-advisedly self-fund another Ordinary Boys record that no one will hear.

5/10/2022,"Over the weekend, the columnist Matthew Parris described how Britain has become, if not ungovernable, at the very least a depressingly awful populace to imagine yourself governing. “A nation that has become obese, uncompetitive, underskilled, stay-at-home, health-obsessed, celebrity-obsessed, rights-obsessed, blame-obsessed, sex-obsessed, woke-obsessed, house-price-obsessed,” he wrote. There was more on the same theme. I shouldn’t really quote it in full, otherwise I would come over as Parris-obsessed, and then where would I be? Totally ungovernable. The problem is, I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone like this. OK, maybe some of us could lose a few pounds. Certainly, a lot of us believe in universal human rights, but I don’t know that you’d call it “obsession”, nor that you could lump it in with a sex obsession, and while we’re here, I don’t even know what a blame obsession is. Yet, even while I’ve never observed it in the wild, this thumbnail – let’s, for brevity, call it the worst society on earth – is ringing a bell. I’ve definitely seen it around – on the pages of the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Express. The fulminating is ceaseless: women “flaunt their curves”, but “sexist slurs” are what other people do; “wokies” and “snowflakes” have capsized education and only know how to complain; renters scavenge off decent people by not being able to buy their own home, because they have spent all their money on coffee then call their landlords because they can’t change a lightbulb; immigrants have 12 children, then selfishly demand that all of them get to go to school. These newspapers burrow around, looking for the most egregious examples of “rights-obsession” Facebook has to offer, and when they can’t find anything, grab a video of the heartwarming moment a puppy sees a mirror for the very first time. The rightwing press has gone not-that-quietly bananas, and we’re all supposed to pretend not to notice. To complain about bias is seen as special pleading. Certain sections of the media have always been openly partisan; only boring people thump on about it. Likewise, to point out the more alarming flirtations with the far right – maybe a columnist wondering about “the Muslim problem” or a political editor pitting the people against the judiciary – would be very old hat. Sweetie, if you think that’s bad, you should have lived through the good old days, when the leader pages openly supported Hitler! But, underneath this same old story, something has changed. The agenda remains the same – the rightwing press supports the right, it’s hardly a mystery – but the standards are different. Consistency has been jettisoned. One day’s headline will be: “As the Left howls for resignations over Met’s £50 Covid fines … Don’t they know there’s a war on?”, and the next seven days will be Keir Starmer drinking a beer. One day, they run a tawdry and sexist smear of Angela Rayner, the next they are asking: “Why is Westminster so tawdry and sexist?” I originally thought the relationship with this part of the print media was like going out with an addict: they might not mean to be hurtful, but they fog you with their own confusion, can’t follow through, can’t keep their story straight. In fact, it’s more like going out with Mr Benn. Which time zone will he be sporting his charming bowler hat in today? Will he have any recollection of where he was yesterday or how it relates to now? Will he have the values of the 1950s (women! Does ambition give you breast cancer?), or the 1890s (bow down before your royal overlords – how much they spent on a legal defence against sexual abuse allegations is none of your concern)? Allied to the inconsistency is maddening projection: they can’t remember what happened 24 hours ago, so neither can you. They’re obsessed with “woke”, therefore you are. They’re constantly questing after superfoods, therefore you’re health-obsessed. They create a public in their own image, and then viscerally hate it. They use their own distortions and excesses to prove how distorted and excessive we’ve all become. And some kind of back-to-front notion of stoicism requires us not to mention it.

5/10/2022,"Last summer I booked flights to New York for a family of four with Aer Lingus for a holiday in April 2022. After receiving the initial booking confirmation in July, I heard from Aer Lingus twice, in August 2021 and February 2022, to inform me of schedule changes. On 6 April 2022, I visited the Aer Lingus website to check in online and discovered the booking had been cancelled in February because the balance had not been paid. This was a shock. I had not received a reminder. My complaint and request for the return of the £530 deposit, owing to a failure of communication, has been rejected. Do I have any hope of retrieving the deposit from Aer Lingus? In 30 years of booking holidays, I have never missed paying a balance. However, this is the first time I have not received a reminder.DF, Hebden Bridge Well, the good news is that there is hope, as after we contacted it Aer Lingus relented and agreed to give you your money back. On its website it says that after 24 hours, the deposit paid on a booking is non-refundable. It also says it will send a “just in case” reminder email when the balance is due, which in this instance it did not do. The airline says: “Aer Lingus offers customers travelling to or from North America the option to pay just 50% of their fare at the time of booking and pay the remaining balance 60 days before their travel date. In this case the balance was not paid within the communicated deadline, which resulted in the booking being cancelled.” However, it adds: “We appreciate on this occasion the customer did not receive a reminder email advising her to pay the balance, and as a gesture of goodwill we have issued a refund for the deposit paid. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.” The Consumer Champions inbox is bulging with travel complaints linked to the turmoil caused by the Covid pandemic.

5/10/2022,"Detectives investigating Keir Starmer’s alleged breach of lockdown rules are considering interviewing the Labour leader face to face, with his Beergate agony likely to last at least a month before a decision on a fine is made. Questionnaires are expected to be sent to those who police identify as having been present at a meal of takeaway curry and beer, but some may be questioned in person, the Guardian understands. Durham police’s investigation is likely to last at least until June and any of the at least 15 people present, including Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, could face a fine if detectives decide they have broken the law. Labour said Starmer had paused work for food in the Durham constituency office of Mary Foy MP in April 2021, working into the evening with party aides on the byelection campaign for a seat in nearby Hartlepool. The Durham force initially said it would not investigate Starmer, believing no rules had been broken, but after a campaign by newspapers supportive of the Conservatives, it cited “significant new information” when it announced an investigation on Friday. One source said that information included the admission that Rayner had been present. Labour initially denied her presence, raising questions about the accuracy of the party’s account. Despite the huge political interest in the saga, the alleged breach is a relatively low-level matter for the police, who will want to ensure their investigation is proportionate but will survive scrutiny. Detectives are expected to seek material showing who was actually present, and who took decisions. They will take accounts from those in the constituency office to determine whether they had a reasonable excuse for their actions. They will also cross-check the accounts they are given and set them against the scores of changes to the regulations during the two years of Covid restrictions. Later on Monday, has emerged Labour was preparing to present police with a dossier of evidence to show that Starmer’s team had worked beyond 1am on the night he was filmed drinking a beer. The dossier includes time-stamped logs of WhatsApp chats, documents and video edits. The estimated one or two months’ duration of the investigation compares with the three days the force took in May 2020 to investigate alleged lockdown breaches by Boris Johnson’s former top aide Dominic Cummings. That inquiry culminated in a short report that found he might have breached Covid rules when he made a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. The force’s report said its officers might have intervened to send Cummings home had they caught him on the trip on 12 April 2020 or fined him if he had refused. The investigation into Starmer is in its early days and the police know they will be under intense scrutiny. The Mail on Sunday produced a leaked Labour memo over the weekend, which the party leader’s critics claimed undermined his account of the event. The political website Politico claimed on Monday that some people at the event were inebriated, which if true might contradict Labour’s story that the meal was a break after which work continued. Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, denies any wrongdoing.",News/Politics,Police consider interviewing Starmer face to face over Beergate claims,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/police-consider-interviewing-starmer-face-to-face-over-beergate-claims
5/10/2022,"“You put your babies in the womb, you will be held accountable!” yelled Steve Corson, tall, bearded and jabbing a finger at women who chanted back: “My body, my choice!” Corson took a deep breath and blew into a shofar. Then Nathan Darnell, wearing a “Jesus Christ is king” cap and holding aloft a cross, grabbed a megaphone. “You guys are demon-possessed!” declared the 19-year-old from Haymarket, Virginia. “You guys are controlled by demons, all of you. Every child has a right to life.” Suddenly Darnell was surrounded by abortion rights protesters brandishing placards. He kept talking. “You guys are evil. The downfall of America is because of every one of you.” The national day of prayer last Thursday was anything but a solemn occasion outside the supreme court in Washington, where hours earlier an unscalable black fence had been erected, reminiscent of the one that surrounded the US Capitol after the January 6 insurrection. The fury was unleashed by a leaked draft opinion that showed the nation’s highest court provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that effectively legalised abortion. It was a political earthquake that revealed American women are perilously close to losing a fundamental right. It was also a milestone in America’s seemingly inexorable journey from United States to divided states. The likely demise of Roe v Wade could drive the biggest wedge yet between what appear to be two irreconcilable nations coexisting under one flag. Liberal states would become sanctuaries for women seeking abortions and saturated with providers; conservative states would turn into deserts that ban the procedure and criminalise doctors who provide it. Some wonder if the country’s social fabric, frayed by four years of Donald Trump’s presidency, can survive. “The death of Roe is going to tear America apart,” ran the headline of a New York Times column by Michelle Goldberg, which concluded that “the death of Roe will intensify our national animus, turning red states and blue into mutually hostile legal territories. You think we hate each other now? Just wait until the new round of lawsuits start.” Simon Schama, a historian, tweeted: “When Roe vs Wade is overturned it will be time to find a different name for this country.” The supreme court’s draft majority opinion, written by Samuel Alito and circulated on 10 February, was leaked to Politico on Monday. It argued in contemptuous tones that Roe v Wade “was egregiously wrong from the start” and “enflamed debate and deepened division”. Four other Republican-appointed justices – Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – agreed that Roe “must be overruled”. If that decision becomes final, possibly next month, it will tear down a national precedent and turn America into a chaotic legal patchwork. The first restrictions would take effect in 13 states with so-called trigger laws to be enacted once Roe is overturned. Some such laws ban abortions almost completely while others would outlaw it after six or 15 weeks. The speed of trigger laws could vary. In Texas, a near-total ban would go into effect 30 days after a supreme court decision. The Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organisation, estimates that 26 of 50 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe is overturned, leaving women in swaths of the south-west and midwest without access. In 11 states there would be no exemptions for rape and incest. Republicans in Louisiana are even considering a bill that would allow prosecutors to charge those having abortions with homicide. Most states where abortion would still be legal are on the west coast or in the north-east. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, on Monday proposed enshrining a right to abortion in the state constitution. In Oregon, Democrats recently passed a bill to create a $15m fund to assist with the costs of abortion, including for women from outside the state. Women might have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. This is likely to be especially difficult for women in poverty, often including women of colour, and lead to a sharp climb in unsafe abortions. Republican-led states have already made efforts to restrict abortion pills, which can be prescribed through online visits. There have been fierce disputes over healthcare, immigration and race in recent years – the journalist Carl Bernstein has spoken of a “cold civil war” – but few can match the raw emotional power of reproductive rights. That much was clear outside the fortified supreme court on Thursday, as two vociferous groups faced off. Rev Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, said into a microphone: “We look forward to the day when abortion ends up on the scrap heap of history like chattel slavery and segregation.” Rochelle Rubin, about 20 paces away, shouted: “You don’t have a uterus! Shut up!” Her voice shaking, Rubin, 50, an estate agent and lawyer, explained later: “This is personal for me. I was born the last year that women could not have abortions. My mother had no choice. Had she made the choice she would have had me, but women of her generation did not have choice. “If I didn’t have a choice, my life would be very different today than it would have been. Ten years years ago I exercised my choice and had an abortion. For 50 years you can have a right – and it could be taken away by five people.” Even as abortion rights activists shouted “Keep your rosaries off my ovaries!” and held placards such as “Women’s bodies are more regulated than guns”, Mahoney said he was “overjoyed” by the draft opinion but acknowledged the societal shockwaves. He said: “Can America get any more divided than we are? Tragically, yes it can. We certainly saw that happen on January 6, which was tragic. I would say we have to find a way to address this. Let’s deal locally so if you have California on one end and Alabama on another end, let’s just work on that.” Mahoney, 68, added: “What you see on the streets is the cutting edge of the cultural fault lines that we see in our country. We saw that with the tragic murder of George Floyd. But our nation went through this upheaval and we’re moving forward so that’s what I hope happens here.” The interview was repeatedly interrupted as Mahoney broke off to restrain fellow anti-abortion activists from confronting female protesters. “That’s not who we are,” he said, and it was true that women from the opposing sides engaged in civil conversations while in fundamental disagreement. But Corson, 65, from Fredonia, Arizona, gripping his shofar and the Stars and Stripes, was more aggressive. He said: “I don’t respect their view at all. They didn’t come out with ‘My body, my choice’ when it came to the [Covid] vaccine. “They have a human body inside them; we speak for that human body; they’re just speaking for themselves. I get sick and tired of these people. They are very corrupt and evil and on the wrong side. It is going to get heated up, no doubt about it. It should. It’s a good issue to get heated up about.” The great divide on abortion is not a 50-50 split. It is asymmetric. A poll released by the Data for Progress thinktank after this week’s leak showed voters wanted to keep Roe by a two-to-one margin. Democrats, independents and more than a third of Republicans support it. Its imminent fall is due to a quirk of US democracy that skews the electoral college, Senate and supreme court out of kilter with the popular will. Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett were appointed by Trump, who lost the national popular vote by 3m, after Senate Republicans blocked Barack Obama’s last nominee, Merrick Garland. This sense of injustice at this democratic deficit – which gives significantly more representation to white citizens than citizens of colour – is only likely to incite anger and dissent as blue states go one way and red states go the other. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said: “The basic structure of politics with all these small rural states being essentially overrepresented is creating the situation where minorities can control the majority. People are going to be furious about it. “Already friends of mine in New York City talk about not letting their tax dollars go to red states because the irony is that all the blue states send more money to the federal government than they get back and the goddam red states take all the money and then try to run the lives of everybody in the blue states. “So there really is a war going on and it’s a cultural war but it’s one that they [Republicans] are destined to lose.” If Roe is struck down, Kamarck noted, it will be the clearest differentiation of rights by state since the era of Jim Crow, when some states racially segregated public places and others did not. This could be a recipe for battles over sovereignty, with red states passing laws to “extradite” anyone who helps their residents get an abortion and blue states passing laws to shield their own doctors. States have been drifting apart for years, across fault lines characterised as liberal v conservative, Black v white, urban v rural, college-educated v blue collar, Hollywood v heartland, mask wearers v vaccine sceptics and MSNBC v Fox News. The 2016 presidential election was framed as Trump’s “deplorables” against Hillary Clinton’s “coastal elites”. The supreme court looks ready to toss a grenade into the mix. Barbara Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and author of How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, said: “What I fear will happen is that it will further create this urban-rural divide where the more moderate and liberal voices in blue states will move, or their children will move, because they will not want their rights restricted. “If you’re a big corporation that employs a lot of women, are you going to move to states where they and their daughters are not treated equally or they’re under these increasingly restrictive and medieval laws?” The fight is under way. A liberal group published the addresses of conservative supreme court justices and encouraged protesters to walk by them. A day of action for abortion rights is planned for Saturday. The issue could also galvanise Democratic turnout in November’s midterm elections. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic congressman from California, said: “There will be an effort to turn out young women and their male allies when that decision comes. I hope it doesn’t have to happen but I think it’s going to be the backfire of the century for Republicans.” The Senate will vote on legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law but Democrats do not have 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster, which means the Joe Biden-backed effort will fail. There have never been so few Republicans who support abortion rights, nor have there ever been so few Democrats who call themselves “pro-life”. Fareed Zakaria, an author and broadcaster, warned in the Washington Post: “You cannot really understand America anymore by looking at averages. It has become two countries. One is urban, more educated, multiracial, secular and largely left of center. The other is rural, less educated, religious, white and largely right of center.” Blue America would fit comfortably with northern European Protestant countries, Zakaria said, while red America’s cultural values make it closer to Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. “For the country’s political future, the central question is now this: can these two Americas find a way to live, work, cooperate with and tolerate one another? If not, the abortion battle may be the precursor to even larger struggles.”",News/US news,Divided States of America: Roe v Wade is ‘precursor to larger struggles’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/divided-america-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-cold-civil-war
5/10/2022,"The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has announced $2.2bn for the eastern section of the Victorian government’s Suburban Rail Loop, described as the biggest transport project in the state’s history. Speaking to reporters in Box Hill, which takes in Victoria’s most marginal electorate of Chisholm, Albanese said the project would transform the way Melburnians travelled around the city. “It will do what great cities do,” he said on Tuesday, standing alongside the state premier, Daniel Andrews, for the first time in this election campaign. “If you think about the great cities of the world – London, Paris, New York – you don’t have to get into the centre to get around those cities. What the Suburban Rail Loop does is improve the efficiency of the entire rail network.” Here’s what we know about the project. The project was announced in August 2018, just months out from the state election, via a slick two-minute video posted on Andrews’s social media. “The biggest public transport project in history is coming to Victoria,” the voiceover said, before unveiling a proposed 90km underground railway line, running between Cheltenham in the south-east and Werribee in the south-west via Melbourne airport. The video said the new line would carry 400,000 passengers a day when complete, taking 200,000 cars off the road and thousands of commuters off existing city-bound trains. At the time, Andrews said the government would commit $300m to a full business case, design and pre-construction works for the project. “I won’t be the premier when this project is finished, but if we are re-elected I will be the premier that gets this project started,” he said in 2018. The government went on to win in a landslide, with an above-average swing to Labor in electorates set to benefit from the loop. Three of the eight seats Labor picked up at the election – Box Hill, Burwood and Mount Waverley – had new stations promised. It depends who you ask. In November 2020, Andrews announced $2.2bn for early works for the first 26km of the project, dubbed SRL East, as well as the location of the six stations between Cheltenham and Box Hill. The following year, the government released its business and investment case for SRL East and SRL North, which runs from Box Hill to Melbourne airport. At the time, it was estimated SRL East would cost up to $34.5bn to complete by 2035. The business case did not detail plans for the western section of the loop, between Melbourne airport and Werribee. In November 2021, the government announced a further $9.3bn for SRL East and awarded the contract for the first phase of works to global construction and engineering firm Laing O’Rourke. The firm has since established its first work site at Clayton and will begin preparing for the launch of the tunnel boring machines, moving and protecting utilities, ground improvement, geotechnical investigations and road modifications. Expressions of interest are now open for two tunnelling packages, to be awarded in late 2023 and 2024. An environment effects statement is still being assessed for the project. The state opposition, meanwhile, has promised an audit of the project before contracts are signed if it wins the 26 November election. The short answer is none. The federal Coalition government rejected a request for $11.5bn in funding over 10 years to help build the project, arguing it doesn’t stack up. After Tuesday’s announcement the prime minister, Scott Morrison, claimed Albanese was a “pushover” for Labor premiers. “What would happen with Anthony Albanese, he’ll be happy to pay for the failures of state Labor governments with federal taxpayers’ money,” he said. Andrews dismissed the criticism, saying the state did not get its fair share of funding from the Morrison government. “Every federal dollar that Victorians get from the miserable Morrison government, [it’s like] we ought to bow our head and treat it like it’s foreign aid,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We have been ripped off by this Liberal-National government, and instead of Mr Morrison talking about these issues, he ought to have been here delivering for Victorian workers and families. “The contrast could not be clearer – Anthony Albanese is about building things. He’s about partnership. He’s about creating jobs.” Albanese said he wanted to work constructively will all state premiers, noting more commonwealth funding was allocated to urban public transport during his time as infrastructure minister “than all previous governments combined”. “I prioritise funding not based upon an electoral map, [but] on need,” he said. During the 2019 federal election, the then opposition leader Bill Shorten appeared alongside Andrews and Albanese – who was then Labor’s infrastructure spokesperson – to announce $10bn for the project if Labor were to win government that year. On Tuesday, Albanese said the $2.2bn commitment “should give the Victorian government confidence that they’ll have a partner with the national government”. “This is a project that will go for a long period of time,” he said. Andrews said: “We would always like more. But $2.2bn versus zero from Scott Morrison … this is the sort of stuff that comes out of prime ministers who are just run out of time.”",News/Australia news,What to know about Anthony Albanese’s $2.2bn pledge for Victoria’s Suburban Rail Loop,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/what-to-know-about-anthony-albaneses-22bn-pledge-for-victorias-suburban-rail-loop
5/10/2022,"“STARMER TO QUIT”, a number of front pages read this morning, and while the following word “IF” is a pretty crucial caveat, it still feels like a huge deal. If you’ve not being following the Beergate story – the Labour leader’s takeaway curry towards the end of a work day in Durham, which relentless coverage has made into an awkward counterpoint to the Downing Street Partygate scandal – you may be quite surprised by Starmer’s promise to go if he is fined over the incident. So how do the two controversies compare? And was it good politics for Starmer to raise the possibility that he might be forced to resign? Today’s newsletter takes you through all that, as well as new details that help explain his decision. First, an apology: I know “-gate” is the most overdone suffix in journalism. But we are where we are. Here are the headlines. Politics | Boris Johnson’s government will force through police powers to prevent disruptive yet peaceful protests as one of 38 new bills in Tuesday’s Queen’s speech. Monarchy | The Queen is to miss the state opening of parliament for only the third time in her reign because of mobility issues. The Prince of Wales will read the speech on her behalf. Russia | Vladimir Putin told Russian soldiers they are “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did” as he used his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on the international community to end a Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports. Philippines | Ferdinand Marcos Jr, son and namesake of the late dictator, has won the country’s presidency. Marcos Jr’s landslide victory signals an extraordinary rehabilitation for the notorious political family. Economy | High inflation rates could last years, not months, and may even rise above 10% or higher, senior economists have warned. Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s former chief economist, said the Bank should have taken tougher action sooner. In the end, Starmer appears to have concluded that he had no choice but to make his dramatic promise to go if he is fined over the incident: if his enemies are going to continue pursuing the Beergate story, he might as well get ahead of it and make Boris Johnson look as unprincipled as possible over Partygate. (For good measure, his deputy Angela Rayner – also present at the event in question – made the same promise.) Here’s a primer on how the stories compare, and the logic behind Starmer’s decision. How widespread were the events? Partygate In terms of scale, it’s pretty hard to argue that Partygate and Beergate were alike. The Partygate roster runs from May 2020 to April 2021. In total, 16 events were examined by civil servant Sue Gray for her report, 12 of which were also the subject of police investigation. Boris Johnson is reported to have been present for six of those 12 events. So far, he has been issued with a fixed penalty notice in relation to one incident, though there could be other fines in the future. Beergate The incident took place on 30 April 2021, at the office of Durham MP Mary Foy. It’s the only occasion on which Starmer has been accused of breaking lockdown rules. What kind of gatherings were they? Partygate The most difficult issues for the prime minister and colleagues in attendance are the events with solely social explanations like Christmas parties and birthday celebrations – including when the strictest lockdown rules were in place. Among a number of examples: in November 2020, Johnson is alleged to have given a speech at a leaving party for special adviser Lee Cain when England was in a month-long lockdown barring meeting people from other households indoors except for work purposes. Beergate When the photograph of Starmer was taken, people in England were subject to “step two” rules, which prevented general socialising but had an exemption for work purposes. Starmer says that he and his colleagues ate briefly in the middle of a long evening of work. But a number of stories have challenged that narrative. The Sunday Times reported claims that some of those attending were “getting pissed”. The Mail on Sunday obtained an internal Labour memo showing that the meal was scheduled, and made the questionable assertion that this showed it was in breach of the rules. During its 12 days of coverage (which began the day after a front page story complaining of Johnson’s critics “Don’t They Know There’s A War On?”), the Daily Mail has reported that an initial denial that Angela Rayner was present was wrong – a fact which Labour claims was an honest mistake. The obvious point of mitigation to a neutral would appear to be that on the night in question, hospitalisations and deaths were close to their lowest ebb at any point during the pandemic. On the other hand, several of the Downing Street events took place at times of the most severe national crisis. Because Starmer has presented himself as – in the words of shadow cabinet member Lisa Nandy – “Mr Rules”, it’s very hard for him and his supporters to make that kind of contextual argument without appearing to accept the underlying claim. Still, Starmer’s fundamental defence – that he briefly broke off from work to eat and then continued – has not changed, or been undermined by a smoking gun. What are the risks of Starmer’s decision? First, the uncomfortable part for the Labour leader: those resignation headlines on almost every front page this morning. However unequivocally he denies doing anything wrong, those only now tuning into the story may draw a pretty blunt conclusion. There are serious long-term downsides attached for Starmer, too. Most obviously, there is the fact that he has removed any discretion about what to do if he gets fined – not a complicated point, but a big one. He meanwhile creates a grey area if the police find there may have been a breach but decide against a fine – exactly what the Durham force did in the case of Dominic Cummings. He appeared to rule out resigning in those circumstances yesterday, but his integrity vs sleaze case will get knottier. Finally, if he does quit, there is little reason to think that Boris Johnson – never that fussed about the high ground – will follow suit, so long as he has the support of the party membership and no obvious successor. The scale of Mr Rules’ moral victory may feel quite limited if he has to leave his job, and the prime minister hangs on to his. What are the benefits? He clearly sees the longer-term arguments in favour as persuasive – particularly if he has concluded that a fine would mean he has to go whether he promises to or not. First, he creates a straightforward contrast with Johnson’s adamant refusal to follow the same logic. (Quite a few members of the shadow cabinet sent tweets featuring the word “integrity” last night.) Second, he probably moves the story past an awkward focus on his own previous insistence that Johnson should go simply because he was under investigation. Third, an ally of Starmer is quoted in this morning’s newspapers saying that the move “puts some pressure on Durham police” over the consequences if they fine him. (The Daily Mail describes that as a “cynical ploy” today. Yesterday it said he was “under intense pressure to say whether he would resign.”) So why has he done it? While some of the more excitable reactions to Starmer’s move seemed to underestimate how much of an issue that would be for Labour, a report by the Guardian’s chief political correspondent, Jessica Elgot, provides pretty strong evidence for why he feels he’s on safe ground. She’s seen WhatsApp records which appear to confirm Starmer’s insistence that work did continue after the takeaway - messages continuing about a campaign video edit until nearly 2am. Labour says it also has evidence of edits to the video script well after the food is said to have arrived. Those details were mysteriously absent from reports in the Mail and the Sun on the story this morning. But if they are decisive as Durham police consider his case, Starmer will probably get over it. In the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, Emma Graham-Harrison reports on the evacuees who have finally escaped Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks. Her story is a remarkable account of what they’ve been through. Archie Simon Jenkins sees the Partygate/Beergate stories as trivial - and argues that both side have been punished, and should return to more serious matters. (You may worry that equating the two feeds a toxic sense that politicians are ‘all the same’ - but he makes a persuasive case.) Archie Kendrick Lamar has released his first single in five years, and, unsurprisingly, he’s still got it. Ben Beaumont-Thomas writes why this song – and the upcoming album that it’s part of – is so culturally significant. When you have a moment, the music video is a must-watch.

5/10/2022,"The artist’s studio is their world. It’s among their most private places, and in Henri Matisse’s case, it’s as intimate a portrait as viewers can get of an artist who very rarely portrayed himself. “The studio is the heart of the artist’s life,” says Ann Temkin, the Museum of Modern Art’s Marie-Josée and Henry Kravis chief curator of painting and sculpture. “It’s not just any interior. It’s the core of what they’ve made their world. When an artist chooses to make a work that’s about the studio, it’s almost by definition a work about art in a much broader way.” That’s never truer than with Matisse’s The Red Studio (1911), a touchstone of MoMA’s collection since 1949. The ​​six-foot-tall and seven-foot-wide painting is, in a sense, itself a show that Matisse has put on in his workspace in the Parisian suburb Issy-les-Moulineaux, scattered with paintings, sculptures, decorative objects and furniture. Those all happen to be swaddled or smothered in a brick-like Venetian red that covers more than two-thirds of the canvas, a gesture that was almost revolutionary at a time when monochrome had not yet established itself in modern art. That audacious spirit continues to speak to viewers today. “When you’re looking at a painting of a studio that also happens to be a really radical work in terms of its stylistic approach, people feel in their bones that here is an artist telling you, ‘Here’s who I am. This is my life. And by presenting it in what was at that time an almost indescribably experimental fashion, I’m demonstrating to you what creative courage is.’” A new exhibition at MoMA reunites the landmark painting with its surviving 10 depicted artworks for the first time in more than a century. Matisse: The Red Studio includes never-before-seen archival photographs and letters alongside paintings and drawings that illuminate the picture’s origins and fascinating history, from its rejection by the Russian patron who commissioned it to its travels abroad (including a stint at a London nightclub) and eventual acquisition by MoMA. This will be the first reconvening of the extant six paintings, three sculptures, and one ceramic since they were together under Matisse’s roof at the time The Red Studio was made. Dating from the previous 13 years, they range from groundbreaking paintings, such as Le Luxe II (1907–08), to lesser-known works, such as Corsica, The Old Mill (1898), to objects only recently rediscovered. The inspiration for MoMA’s arrangement of these came from Matisse’s many paintings of goldfish bowls from that period: “There’s no directionality, no beginning and end,” Temkin says. “Museumgoers can swim around the paintings and sculptures in this goldfish bowl.” These works leave a predominant impression of an abundance of bodies – in poses languorous, reclining, and stretched, crouching, twisted, and curled. Indeed, Sergei Shchukin, the Moscow textile magnate who was then Matisse’s most important patron, preferred the figures in Matisse’s paintings, as he politely noted in a letter on view rejecting the finished Red Studio. That marks the start of a surprising trajectory from relatively little-known painting to one of Matisse’s most celebrated, with one exhibition room devoted to the work’s biography and historical journey. “In this digital age in which the image can be reproduced endlessly, people have begun to forget that the painting is an object that has a life,” Temkin points out. “It’s not like works are born famous. It may be a few years, many decades, or centuries before it lands on the wall where viewers look at it. Those histories can be absolutely enthralling and unlikely.” After Shchukin’s rejection, the work debuted on the international stage, where it was met with mostly derision. Matisse kept it in his possession and out of public view for 12 years until it found an unlikely home at the chic London hot spot the Gargoyle Club in the late 1920s and 30s. Only when it landed in New York in the mid 1940s did it finally find an enthusiastic reception in the art world. “So many of the landmark works of modern art were despised or ignored for a long time,” explains Temkin. “A picture’s life takes form because of the places it goes and the people who get to see it. We want viewers to realize how contingent all of that is. Art history isn’t some clean line that happens in some predetermined direction. It’s all of these twists and turns and accidents and surprises. You could call it the history of taste or collecting. I have a feeling that even Matisse did not really fully understand The Red Studio for a long time.” After the second world war, artists began making paintings that were flat, monochrome, and abstract and came to see Matisse’s picture as a model – one that didn’t show the typical foreground and background and eschewed conventional narrative or scenery. “The painting got reborn through the eyes of an artist like Mark Rothko and Ellsworth Kelly,” Temkin says. “When people were looking at The Red Studio in 1911 or 1920 or even 1930, it looked like a red rectangle with these little spots of color in it, and they just couldn’t decipher it. But then artists went on to make even more radical things than that, with no references to any objects. Matisse’s painting somehow became understandable as the ancestor to that new abstract art.” The exhibition also includes a conservation video with recent discoveries about the story of the mysterious painting’s creation. On close study, MoMA’s conservators discerned shades of blue, pink, and ochre peeking through the coat of red paint, in addition to trace drips of those colors at the painting’s edges. It turns out the original painting was closer in palette to the more naturalistic The Pink Studio, which Matisse had made for Shchukin earlier that year. The red, it appears, was applied in a fit of inspiration a month or more after the previous layers dried – Matisse apparently slathered on the red with such speed and vigor that paintbrush hairs were ripped out and caught in the paint. In Matisse’s final years, he appeared to return to The Red Studio once again, in a sense. “The freedom and the liberation that he found with his late cutouts can be traced to the spirit of The Red Studio,” Temkin says. Matisse pinned these cutouts directly on to his walls, and the floating colored shapes and forms in effect replaced The Red Studio’s particular paintings. After all, that artwork “is almost just a space of the imagination. You don’t feel that you’re looking at a concrete room that actually exists – you don’t see the floor or the walls, a door, ceilings. That sense of boundlessness is exactly what he was doing with his cutouts in his studio at the end of his life.” That blurring of art and life was a constant and fundamental piece of Matisse’s work. “This painting is extremely literal in portraying his workplace and its contents, but at the same time the picture is almost an imaginary universe,” Temkin says. “Matisse’s art is almost a philosophical art – what is art and what is so-called real life? That ambiguity is something he played with his entire life.” Matisse: The Red Studio is now on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York until 10 September",Arts/Art and design,‘Absolutely enthralling’: why Matisse’s Red Studio still packs a punch,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/10/absolutely-enthralling-why-matisses-red-studio-still-packs-a-punch
5/10/2022,"The media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released the 20th edition of its World Press Freedom Index last week, in which it underscored “a twofold increase in polarisation amplified by information chaos.” Media polarisation is emerging as one overarching hurdle inhibiting progress in conflict-marred regions of Africa, where it is also fast becoming an open threat to peace and security. Few countries illustrate this gloomy trend better than Mali in the Sahel, and Ethiopia at the Horn of Africa. In Mali, political uncertainty and tensions between the country’s government and former colonial power, France, have increased since a military coup led by Colonel Assimi Goita in August 2020 overthrew elected President Ibrahim Keïta, who was supported by France. Last week, the military government accused the two French broadcasters RFI and France24 of airing disinformation about reports of human rights violations by the Malian army around the town of Diabaly. The Malian government accused France of spying after the French military released a video of what it said were mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked security firm Wagner burying bodies at a mass grave on 20 April. NGOs including Human Rights Watch have accused the Malian junta of targeting innocent civilians with over 100 people said to have been killed since December. Mali said the reports that its army had carried out abuses contained false allegations aimed at destabilising the government. Mali’s High Communication Authority has decided to ban RFI and France 24 from the Malian airwaves. UN rights office spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani warned that the current climate in Mali is “one with a pervasive chilling effect on journalists.” As the space for free expression is severely curtailed in Mali, social media platforms are playing an increasingly important role. In a region already blighted by military coups in Guinea and Burkina Faso, the current social and political tensions in the west African nation are sustained by disinformation and inflammatory content, which have proven difficult to stamp out. Mali is now placed 111 out of the 180 countries monitored in the latest World Press Freedom index, a 12-place drop from 2021.In the eastern part of the continent, Ethiopian federal troops deployed by the prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, have been fighting the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) since November 2020. Journalists and human rights groups have reported serious abuses in the country, mostly mass killings and violent atrocities. Victims blame federal Ethiopian soldiers, the Amhara regional militias and Eritrean forces. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has said that serious violations of international law may have been committed by Ethiopia, Eritrea and the TPLF. Ethiopia is ranked 114 in the latest press-freedom rankings, 13 places down from last year. Ahmed made a promising start when he took power in April 2018, but the Nobel peace prize-winner’s war in Tigray has meant a rapid reversal of positive developments, including in the area of press freedom. This year’s index show that new freedoms are severely threatened. The Committee to Protect Journalists has reported on how erosion of media rights has seriously increased during the conflict. Several journalists and media workers accused of helping foreign media have been arrested. Furthermore, Ethiopian news media have become dangerously divided along ethnic lines. Facebook and Twitter have come under fire over their roles in the conflict. Critics argue they are not doing enough to prevent the spread of hate speech and incitements to violence on their platforms. Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen has also stated that “in places like Ethiopia” social media “is fanning ethnic violence”, a claim the firms reject. The RSF uses five indicators to compile the index: political context, legal framework, economic context, sociocultural context and security. Whereas the most worrying part for Mali is the political context, Ethiopia scores extremely low on the security indicator. The Nobel committee’s decision to award the 2021 peace prize to journalists Maria Ressa from the Philippines and Dmitrij Muratov from Russia stressed the importance of quality journalism as a prerequisite for democracy and peace. Both countries continue to plunge on the RSF list. After its invasion of Ukraine, and the ongoing information war, Russia is now ranked 155th, with the situation for press freedom described as “very bad”. Today, parts of the Nobel peace prize committee’s rationale can be read almost as a prelude to what was to come: “A free, independent and fact-based journalism protects against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda”.
