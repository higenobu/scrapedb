5/5/2022,"People in rural New South Wales have “significantly poorer health outcomes” due to a system that is “failing” them, according to a scathing report handed to the state government on Thursday. The report included 44 recommendations to fix the healthcare system in rural, regional and remote areas which it found was “in crisis”. Its tabling in parliament follows a year-long inquiry that received more than 700 submissions and held 15 hearings, where doctors, patients, nurses and administrators outlined the extreme challenges faced in their communities. Recommendations include ways to address inferior access to services and disadvantage in Indigenous communities. Among 22 findings of the inquiry were the significant financial challenges for regional patients compared with people in cities and that issues were exacerbated by a “culture of fear” within the health department. The report also found significant under-resourcing, and said the funding divide between the state and commonwealth governments had “led to both duplication and gaps in service delivery”. The committee concluded there has been a “historic failure” by both levels of government to support and retain health professionals especially doctors and nurses in rural, regional and remote areas. The disadvantage and discrimination experienced in Indigenous communities were also highlighted in the report. “It is unacceptable that some First Nations people still experience discrimination when seeking medical assistance in some rural, regional and remote hospitals in NSW,” the report said. “Telehealth has created another barrier for First Nations people in terms of accessing culturally appropriate health services.” Among the extensive recommendations was a funding model review, greater engagement with local community groups and more funding for regional nurse practitioners. The report also recommended the state and commonwealth governments work together on a 10-year workforce strategy and for a second inquiry to be held in two years to check on the state’s progress. The inquiry heard stories of people travelling long distances to receive care, hospitals operating without doctors and the difficulty of recruiting GPs into regional areas. Nurses recounted horror stories including patients dying on bathroom floors, families with loved ones in palliative care being forced to administer intravenous painkillers themselves, and cleaners and cooks performing nursing duties.

5/5/2022,"On 9 May about 67.5 million Filipinos will go to the polls to decide who should replace the populist president Rodrigo Duterte. He has reached the end of his six-year term and is constitutionally barred from running again. It’s not just the presidential post that will be decided on 9 May. Thousands of positions are being contested across the country – from the vice presidency and Senate seats, to 18,000 local positions, including city mayors and provincial governors. Election posters are almost inescapable: they are pinned to the front of homes, along walkways and are plastered on billboards. Most ballots will be cast on election day. More than 1.6 million Filipinos who work overseas began voting for national candidates on 10 April. Voting is due to close at 7pm on Monday, though the Commission on Elections has said it may extend voting hours if people are still waiting outside polling stations. Vote counting will begin as soon as the ballots close, and the winner could be apparent within hours. However, in 2016, Duterte was not officially declared the winner until almost three weeks later. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, 64, known as Bongbong Marcos, the namesake and only son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, is leading the opinion polls. His family’s name and history is deeply divisive. The family plundered billions of dollars from the state, and the imposition of martial law by Marcos Sr in 1972 marked one of the darkest periods in the country’s history. Marcos Jr was 28 years old when his father was toppled by the 1986 People Power Revolution. The family was forced to flee the Malacañang Palace and went into exile. Observers say that, ever since, the Marcoses have been intent on returning to the country’s highest office. Marcos Jr’s mother, Imelda, has previously described the presidency as her son’s “destiny”. Marcos Sr died in exile, but the family were allowed to return to the Philippines during the 1990s, when they began to rebuild their presence in public life. Marcos Jr was subsequently elected Ilocos Norte governor, a congressman and a senator. In 2016, he ran for vice president, but lost to Leni Robredo, a human rights lawyer who is now running against him in the presidential race. Marcos Jr has downplayed or denied abuses committed under his father, and has developed a large social media presence that has allowed the family to rebrand itself. Accounts linked to or supportive of the family have spread disinformation about Marcos regime, portraying it as a golden era. He has campaigned with the slogan “together we will rise again”, promising unity and hope, while also stating he will prioritise the cost of living and jobs. However, he has not taken part in presidential debates and has dodged tough media questions, including over his father’s legacy, his family’s ill-gotten wealth (estimated to be as much as US$10bn) and his own unpaid tax bill. Second in the polls is vice-president Leni Robredo, who has presented herself as a true alternative to the likes of Marcos and Duterte. The daughter of a judge and an English professor, Robredo previously worked for nongovernment organisations providing legal assistance to marginalised groups. She entered politics after the death of her husband, interior secretary Jesse Robredo, who was killed in a plane crash in 2012. Robredo was elected vice president in 2016, and has had a frosty relationship with Duterte, criticising his “war on drugs”, and speaking out about human rights issues. She has warned of the risks of populist leaders, condemned the legal charges against Nobel prize-winning journalist Maria Ressa, and the decision to grant Marcos Sr a hero’s burial. In the Philippines, the vice president and president are elected separately. Robredo has promised to tackle corruption in politics, and her campaign slogan is “Honest government, a better life for all”. The only woman presidential candidate, she has been labelled as weak by critics and been targeted by online smears and misinformation, according to fact-checker group Tsek.ph. Marcos has a significant lead in polling, however Robredo has been boosted by huge turnouts at recent rallies, and by her army of passionate volunteers – 2 million in total – who have been going house to house to persuade undecided voters. Further behind Robredo is Manny Pacquiao, a champion boxer and national hero. Pacquiao, a former street kid who rose to become a sports star, began his political career in 2010, becoming a member of the House of Representatives and then a senator in 2016. He was once an ally of Duterte, but relations between the two have since soured. He has accused Duterte of being too close to China, and has promised to tackle corruption. Also running is Isko Moreno, a former actor and current Manila mayor. He grew up in one of Manila’s poorest neighbourhoods before he was talent spotted and began a career in TV and film. Duterte has mocked him over his showbiz past, likening him to “a call boy” for having posed for racy photos. Moreno has pledged to take a tough stance on Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, to continue infrastructure projects started under Duterte, and has presented himself as a “healing” candidate. Trailing behind in the polls is Panfilo Lacson, a senator and former police chief. He is known for having a touch stance on crime and for backing a controversial anti-terror law, which permits warrantless arrests and allows authorities to hold individuals for weeks without charge. Duterte’s presidency has been tumultuous and attracted strong criticism from rights groups but he remains popular at home. Many supporters believe he has delivered what he promised at the start of his term, including taking a tough stance on crime and corruption. His straight-talking, strong man image appears to still resonate with many, and his popularity has endured even after the Philippines faced one of the world’s toughest Covid lockdowns. His daughter, Sara Duterte, who is the frontrunner in the race for the vice presidency, has benefited from the popularity of the family name. But rights experts at home and abroad have criticised Duterte’s authoritarian style of leadership, including his approach to drugs-related crime and his intolerance of dissent. Last year the international criminal court announced it was investigating his so-called “war on drugs”, in which as many as 30,000 people are estimated to have been killed.",News/World news,Philippines election 2022: everything you need to know about the vote for president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/philippines-election-2022-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vote-for-president
5/5/2022,"The Jacqui Lambie Network will preference Labor above the Liberals in the critical Tasmanian seats of Braddon and Lyons, but will put the Liberal Bridget Archer above Labor’s Ross Hart in the ultra-marginal seat of Bass. Having secured preferences in two lower house seats, Labor will preference Lambie’s Senate candidate Tammy Tyrrell above other parties and independents, which boosts her chances of grabbing the final Tasmanian Senate spot. The preference swaps will help Labor in its effort to retain Lyons, a seat the Liberals are targeting, and boost its chances of winning Braddon, which is held by the Liberal Gavin Pearce on a margin of 3.1%. Lambie’s support will be helpful to Archer, a Liberal moderate who holds Bass on a 0.4% margin. Pauline Hanson confirmed last week that in the Tasmanian contests, she would preference against Archer in Bass but in favour of Pearce in Braddon. Hanson rounded on Lambie at the end of April, accusing her of doing a deal with the Liberal party after the Tasmanian Liberals confirmed they would recommend that voters support Lambie candidates ahead of One Nation. The One National leader told Sky News she was “shocked and disgusted” with the Liberals for supporting the Lambie Network “without even debating and negotiating” with Lambie, and also criticised the Liberals’ decision to preference Derryn Hinch’s Justice party ahead of One Nation in Victoria. Lambie flatly denied at that time any deal had been done with the Liberals. She said on Thursday “there was talk many months ago about preferences” during a walk down the Senate corridor. Guardian Australia understands Archer will appear at No 3 on the Lambie how-to-vote cards for Bass, with Labor’s candidate, Ross Hart, at No 5. In Lyons, Labor’s Brian Mitchell will appear at No 3 and the Liberal candidate, Susie Bower, at No 5. Labor’s Chris Lynch will appear at No 6 in Braddon, followed by Pearce at No 7. Lambie will put the high-profile independent Craig Garland, who has recommended in the past his supporters support Labor ahead of the Liberals, and the Local party’s Scott Rankin ahead of the major parties in Braddon. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Strategists are privately confident that Labor will hold Lyons. Braddon at this point is considered line ball, although Labor believes Lambie preferences will strengthen its position. The Liberals are confident Archer can hold on in Bass, even though Scott Morrison is unpopular in the north of the state. Lambie told the ABC on Thursday she believed Labor was picking up steam in Tasmanian seats. “[Anthony Albanese] has picked up a whole new level ahead of Morrison down here in Tassie and I think that has got a lot to do with the cost of living – I’ll be honest with you,” she said. “People are really, really feeling it.” She said that in 2019 Labor had lost momentum during the campaign. “I can tell you now, that is not happening to Anthony Albanese.” She said many voters in the state felt the Liberals had been in government for nine years “and they are doing it harder than ever”. “Jobseeker is gone, jobkeeper is gone, the little bit of savings they might have saved up because they couldn’t go out and wine and dine and spend their money during Covid – that has now gone. “Their electricity bills are about to come in, fuel has gone through the roof, a leg of lamb down here in Tasmania … is fifty bucks, people are living on chicken, which is great for our chicken guys down here … people are having to buy chicken because they can’t afford meat, so I tell you, they are really feeling it. “Groceries are killing them.” Lambie played down the significance of any preference swaps on the outcome of the election contest. She said Tasmanians were not big followers of how-to-vote cards. “Most people go above the line in Tasmania,” she said. “It’s not a big deal.”",News/Australia news,Jacqui Lambie preferences Labor in two Tasmanian seats but backs Bridget Archer in Bass,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/election-2022-jacqui-lambie-network-preferences-labor-over-liberals-in-two-tasmanian-seats-but-backs-bridget-archer
5/5/2022,"Two men have died after allegedly being stabbed in Melbourne in the early hours of Thursday morning. A woman was arrested at a tram stop in Carlton after two men were fatally stabbed at an address at Hope Street in Brunswick. Emergency services were called to the scene at about 5.20am where they found a man in his 50s with fatal stab wounds. He was taken to hospital but died in the ambulance on the way there. Another man, 59, was also found dead. Acting assistant police commissioner, Mick Frewen, said reports were then received by police that there was a female on a tram “covered in blood” on the way into the city. Police arrested her at a tram stop in Carlton. “At this stage, we don’t know the interrelationship between all parties,” Frewen said. “Homicide investigators are on scene working through obviously a complex double homicide scene, as well as the tram. “What we’re trying to understand [is what] unfolded over the course of late last night, early this morning.” The woman is now being treated in hospital for minor injuries and police have been unable to interview her as yet. No charges have been laid.

A burnt-out BMW was found on the side of a nearby road and police believe it is the same vehicle used in the shooting. Police and emergency services were called to the street at about 12.05am where they found Kesici’s body in the middle of the street. Frewen said it wasn’t a “random shooting”. “It was more than a simple street exchange,” he said. “The people that arrived in that street at that time came prepared for violence. “They were armed, they had a vehicle that we believe obviously had been burnt-out and you know, they obviously wanted to destroy evidence.” The men in the car have not been found and a police search is under way. “I want to reassure the public that we’re throwing all the available resources from homicide, state anti-gang division and local resources into solving this as soon as we can.” Police do not believe the incidents are related and are asking for anyone with any information on either incident to come forward.",News/Australia news,Woman reportedly ‘covered in blood’ arrested on tram after two men fatally stabbed in Melbourne,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/05/woman-arrested-on-tram-after-two-men-fatally-stabbed-in-melbourne
