1/13/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Thursday defended its “historical rights” to virtually the entire South China Sea, following a new U.S. government report saying Beijing’s claims are almost entirely invalid. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called the State Department report “Limits in the Seas,” issued this month, an attempt to “distort international law, confuse the public, sow discord and disrupt the regional situation.” “China has historical rights in the South China Sea. China’s sovereignty and related rights and interests in the South China Sea have been established in a long period of history and are consistent with international law,"" Wang said. The vast maritime region has been tense because six other governments claim all or part of the strategically vital waterway, through which an estimated $5 trillion in global trade travels each year and which holds rich but fast declining fishing stocks and significant undersea oil and gas deposits. The U.S. holds no official position on who owns what features in the sea, but maintains the absolute right to operate in what it insists are international waters. That includes sailing Navy warships past Chinese-held features, including artificial islands equipped with airstrips and other military facilities. The U.S. report said Beijing's claim ""has no legal basis and is asserted by (China) without specificity as to the nature or geographic extent of the ‘historic rights' claimed."" The U.S. study also said that China's claim to sovereignty covering more than 100 features submerged at high tide were inconsistent with international law; that its enclosure of vast areas of the sea was unsupported by international law; and that its practice of claiming maritime zones based on labeling each island group as a whole was “not permitted by international law."" China's “expansive maritime claims in the South China Sea are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,"" the study said. “The overall effect of these maritime claims is that (China) unlawfully claims sovereignty or some form of exclusive jurisdiction over most of the South China Sea,"" it said. In his response, Wang said the U.S. “arbitrarily misinterprets the convention, engages in political manipulation with multiple standards for its own selfish interests, and undermines the international rule of law."" He also renewed China's criticism of a 2016 international arbitration ruling that mostly invalidated Beijing's claims. The ruling is “illegal and null and void. China does not accept or recognize it,"" Wang said.",World/Associated Press,China defends sweeping maritime claims after US criticism,https://news.yahoo.com/china-defends-sweeping-maritime-claims-103011428.html
1/13/2022,"Former President Donald Trump told NPR he felt comfortable being fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But he also said he didn't see why COVID-19 survivors needed shots unless they're in at-risk groups. People can get COVID-19 more than once, and experts still recommend a full vaccine course. Former President Donald Trump, who is triple-vaccinated, said in a new interview that he didn't understand why people who had caught COVID-19 would ever get vaccinated unless they're old or immunocompromised. During an interview with NPR's Steve Inskeep published Wednesday, Trump responded to a question about the millions of Americans who hadn't been fully vaccinated by predicting the pandemic ""is going to phase out."" ""You know, there are many people that have had it, if you look at the numbers,"" Trump answered, referring to coronavirus infections. ""I don't know why they would be getting the vaccine for the most part, unless they were at a certain age group and they had certain problems, whether it's the high blood pressure, diabetes, and, you know, various things in particular."" While studies have indicated that past infection can offer long-term protection against the coronavirus, people can still get COVID-19 more than once, and researchers recommend a full vaccine course, including a booster, to lower the risk of reinfection. Trump has in recent weeks heavily endorsed COVID-19 vaccinations, and he told NPR he felt ""very comfortable"" being vaccinated. Many of his supporters remain anti-vaccination, however, and in a live interview last month he told his supporters not to boo when he announced he had received a booster shot. He also told NPR he didn't believe in vaccine mandates, saying they're ""bad for the economy."" Last year, President Joe Biden announced COVID-19 vaccine mandates for private companies and health workers, but they have been ensnared in a series of court cases that have since reached the Supreme Court. The NPR interview, which was meant to last 15 minutes, was cut short after Trump hung up the phone while being challenged over his false election-fraud claims. The former president has previously discussed who he thinks should take the COVID-19 vaccine. In an interview with the One America News Network, which aired Tuesday, Trump said he didn't think ""young, healthy"" people should take the vaccine. ""I don't think that certainly, these young kids should take it,"" he said, according to a clip of the interview published by Mediaite, adding, ""Their immune systems are so strong."" As of Tuesday, just over 60% of the US population was considered fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
