1/31/2022,"Two Florida sheriff’s deputies who were in a romantic relationship were found dead of an apparent murder-suicide while traveling with other co-workers on vacation. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office said Detective Daniel Leyden was heard arguing with the other deputy on Saturday night just before gunshots rang out in a rental home in Augustine. Both were found with fatal wounds. Leyden’s appeared to be self-inflicted, authorities said. “Our Sheriff's Office family is still reeling from the shock of this unthinkable tragedy. My prayers for strength and comfort are with the families and loved ones of these deputies, and every member of Team HCSO affected by this painful loss,” Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. “Violence is never a solution, and I urge any employee who is dealing with a crisis to take advantage of the many resources our agency has created over the past several years which include Peer Support, Chaplains, and a clinical psychologist. Help is just a phone call away.” The victim has not been publicly identified but officials said they were assigned to a uniform patrol unit. Leyden worked in the criminal investigation unit.

1/31/2022,"Former President Donald Trump held another ""Save America Rally"" on Saturday in Conroe, Texas. Trump has not announced if he will run again but hinted at taking back the White House. The National Governors Association's Republican chair said he doesn't think Trump should run again. Despite not formally announcing his candidacy, former President Donald Trump strongly hinted at a presidential re-election bid during his ""Save America Rally"" on Saturday night in Conroe, Texas. ""And in 2024, we are going to take back that beautiful, beautiful house that happens to be white, that is so magnificent, and that we all love. We are going to take back the White House,"" Trump said during his speech. —חסידישע מידיא (@realhasidic) January 30, 2022 Throughout the rally, the former president took jabs at Democratic leadership and stuck to his usual talking points about issues like immigration and COVID-19, which he read from prompters and prepared comments. If Trump does decide to run in 2024, he faces an uphill battle to become the Republican presidential nominee. Recent polling by the Marquette University Law School found that found that 43% of adults nationwide would support President Joe Biden if the 2024 presidential election were held today, while 33% would vote for Trump, according to The Hill. However, Biden polled slightly worse in a hypothetical race against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential Republican contender for the nomination. Asa Hutchinson, who serves as the Republican chairman of the National Governors Association, said on Saturday that he does not think Trump should lead the party or country as president. Instead, Hutchinson said Republicans should consider ""different voices"" within their party.

1/31/2022,"It's been a frustrating pandemic-long journey for house seekers like Adan Martinez. He's been hoping to buy his first home near Harlingen, Texas, with a budget of $200,000.  ""There were several homes I was interested in but waited off on, $180K and $215K, respectfully. But mid-year last year, prices on them jumped to well over $50K-80K,"" Martinez told Yahoo Finance.  The rush to find a home is now greater than ever. Home prices keep rising — as mortgage rates inch higher. ""[I'm] definitely feeling a sense of urgency to buy and take advantage of lower interest rates. But as is the case when the rates are high, many homes will be available, but way out of my budget,"" he said.  Adding to the pressure, house hunters are seeing far fewer options compared to last year. Pending home sales, which measure contracts on residencies set to close, were down far more than expected in December, amid acute tight inventory.   The secondary and vacation property areas are just as competitive, even as rates tick higher. Jocie Jandovitz, a realtor based out of Naples, Florida, says homes are flying off the shelves for well over regular market value.   ""I would say probably 90% of our transactions, particularly right now are cash,"" Jandovitz told Yahoo Finance. ""They might get a loan, but they don't care really what the rates are going be."" The real-estate agent estimates supply in the area is at roughly 25% of normal levels. Potential sellers are sometimes reluctant to list for fear of not finding another property.  High inflation is also making home owners think twice about selling. Jandovitz says some of them insist, ""I'm never selling my place. I'm keeping it for my family."" ""People feel like they have a really strong asset that they don't want to let go of — and that they'd like to keep, to see where it goes. They feel like it's valuable,"" she adds.  Throughout much of last year, builders ran into supply-chain bottlenecks on everything from front doors to windows, roofs and tiles. Those issues contributed to delays in the completion of new homes.  ""The builders have been battling like whack-a- mole forever, it feels like,"" said David O'Reilly, CEO Howard Hughes Corporation (HHC), the largest developer of master plan communities in the U.S. On the bright side, supply chain challenges appear to be easing somewhat. December's housing completions were up 22% month over month, at roughly 96,000.  ""That's the first time in 18 months, we've been over 80,000. So if home builders are completing homes at what is a breakneck pace ... they're starting to figure out those supply chain issues,"" said O'Reilly. He points out the bigger challenge is the ability for builders to get their hands on vacant developed lots. When the pandemic hit, land developers thought there would be a housing slowdown as the country went into lockdown mode. They initially put the breaks on their efforts to develop lots. Reversing that hiatus has been riddled with delays.  ""I think that's the bigger constraint,"" said O'Reilly. ""Permitting has been delayed because government agencies have been reluctant to bring workers back or when they have, they've been at part staff. There's been some meaningful weather delays in some areas of the country like Florida and Houston that had very wet summers last year,"" he said. ""I think it's going take about two years to close that gap so that builders can get access to those vacant developed lots to keep up with their incoming orders,"" added O'Reilly.  The value of the entire residential real estate market in the US jumped by almost $7 trillion 2021, by far the largest growth of any given year, according to research by Zillow.  The housing market is now worth $43.4 trillion – more than double from a decade ago, since the post-Great Recession lows. Fannie Mae forecasts home prices will rise another 7%-8% in 2022. That's one of the more conservative estimates. Last quarter, Goldman Sachs predicted home prices will grow another 16% by the end of this year.  The pandemic has proven that hindsight is 20/20 for those still searching for a house, like Martinez.  ""I should have bought what was available then. Waited for something better, but along with that came better selling prices for the sellers."" Ines is a markets reporter covering stocks from the Nasdaq.
