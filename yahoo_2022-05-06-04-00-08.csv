5/6/2022,"Danica Patrick wishes she could have sent a message to her younger self. After revealing that she had her breast implants removed, the former professional driver is opening up about body image and what led to her decision to go under the knife. ""I wish I could of told this 32 year old girl that boobs won’t make you more perfect or have it all or be more feminine,"" the now 40-year-old wrote in a caption on Instagram alongside a photo of herself pre-enhancement. ""These were my reasons and to me these narratives are the problem. Implants just feed into it. Culture feeds into it. Social media feeds into it. Filters feed into it. Unhealed trauma feeds into it."" She went on to say that ""the work is always an inside job"" but ""the real question is - how can I do the emotional work to see myself as perfect, having it all, and feminine? When we do that, we won’t seek outside validation or a way to get it."" She concluded, ""Super grateful to be feeling better so quickly. To be clear, the transparency of the dangers of implants are an issue. I also understand that mastectomy’s require options. However, all I’m saying is, if we don’t have an insecurity issue... any potential risk or danger go away."" Patrick claimed she was suffering from breast implant illness, which motivated her to have the implants removed. While breast implant illness is not considered an official medical diagnosis, patients have reported a variety of symptoms ranging from chronic pain to brain fog. In April, Patrick opened up about her decision to get her breast implants removed following a long list of health complications that started in 2018 and intensified by the end of 2020. Patrick was hesitant to share the news but hopes her journey can be a lesson for those who are considering the procedure. Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

5/6/2022,"Organizers of an Ohio marathon and the family of a 6-year-old boy who was allowed to race are receiving heavy criticism from the running community, including some Olympians. Kami and Ben Crawford, of Bellevue, Kentucky, say their 6-year-old son joined their family of eight in the Flying Pig Marathon, held Sunday, May 1, in Cincinnati. The boy’s inclusion in the 26.2-mile race was allowed despite marathon participants needing to be at least 18 years old. The family crossed the finish line together at just over 8 hours, 36 minutes. Children in the Crawford family have raced in at least 33 marathons, but it’s the latest one that is drawing complaints. One social media post by the parents said the boy was “struggling physically” around the 20th mile and needed to sit every three minutes. But the boy was promised two sleeves of Pringles, which the family said helped push him to the finish line. The parents said the boy was not forced to run, and they did not see signs that he was suffering from heat exhaustion or dehydration. “Yes there were tears. He had a fall and every single member of our family has cried during marathons,” the Crawfords said. “These experiences were very limited compared to what has been reported and despite the incredible physical and emotional difficulty of running a marathon the amount of his crying is comparable to what we would have experienced had we stayed home on a Sunday morning.” Many people were wondering why the boy was allowed to compete. Flying Pig Marathon organizers said on Facebook on Tuesday, May 3, that it grants “special accommodations” for some entries. Lee Troop, an Australian who raced in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics, was critical of both the parents and the organizers. He called it “unacceptable” and said the race director should have told the family “No.” Some of his thoughts were echoed by Kara Goucher, who represented the United States as a distance runner at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. “As an Olympic athlete, I promise you this is not good for the child,” Goucher said. “Children are children. Let them run around, but as the parent you need to protect their growing bodies and their young minds.” I don't know who needs to hear this but a six year old cannot fathom what a marathon will do to them physically. A six year old does not understand what embracing misery is. A six year who is ""struggling physically"" does not realize they have the right to stop and should. — Kara Goucher (@karagoucher) May 4, 2022 Yes, the parents letting, encouraging & dragging their 6 year old through a marathon is bad.But, it starts with the event & Race Director who should have said “No” from the start. There are reports a 12 year old ran too!This is unacceptable & needs to be reviewed. https://t.co/TJsnSNPkk9 — Lee Troop (@runtroopy) May 5, 2022 As the race has faced days of backlash, race director Iris Simpson Bush released a letter in which she “assume(d) full responsibility for the decision,” noting it was not “the best course of action.” “This decision was not made lightly because the father was determined to do the race with his young child regardless,” Simpson said in the letter, obtained by The Cincinnati Enquirer. “They had done it as bandits in prior years before we had any knowledge and we knew he was likely to do so again.” Flying Pig will enforce its 18-and-up rules moving forward, the race organizer said. Race results for the 6-year-old boy have been removed from Flying Pig’s website, according to RunningMagazine.ca. The Crawford family is no stranger to enduring tough physical challengers together. Ben Crawford authored a book in 2020, telling the story of how the family of eight broke the record “for the largest family... to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.”",U.S./Lexington Herald-Leader,Struggling 6-year-old completes marathon with family.

5/6/2022,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — One of the men convicted of murder in the street chase and fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery spoke with his former boss, the local district attorney, several times by phone in the days and weeks following the 2020 killing, according to a court document filed Thursday. Investigators found that the day after the shooting, then-Brunswick Judicial Circuit District Attorney Jackie Johnson placed a phone call to Greg McMichael, a retired investigator for her office who initiated the deadly pursuit of Arbery. The call lasted more than nine minutes, prosecutors said in a misconduct case against Johnson said in the legal filing. The filing opposes defense motions seeking dismissal of the case. It listed 16 calls between phone numbers for Johnson and McMichael starting Feb. 23, 2020, when McMichael left Johnson a voicemail about an hour after the shooting, and ending May 5, 2020, the day graphic cellphone video of Arbery's killing leaked online. The video sparked a national outcry over the young Black man's death at the hands of three white pursuers. More than half the calls lasted just a few seconds to a minute, suggesting some went unanswered and others involved voicemails. Seven calls lasted between just shy of three minutes to 21 minutes, according to the court record. A grand jury indicted Johnson last year on a felony charge of violating her oath of office as well as a misdemeanor count of hindering a police investigation. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr's office is prosecuting the case, which alleges Johnson used her position to protect McMichael and his son. ""The evidence shows that Johnson showed favor and affection for McMichael throughout the pendency of the case — including when she was making decisions as the DA over his case,” the prosecutors' legal filing said. Johnson has insisted she recused herself immediately from the investigation and turned the case over to outside prosecutors. Her attorneys have asked a judge to dismiss the charges, saying “there is not a scintilla of evidence” that she interfered with the police investigation. Johnson's attorney, John Ossick, did not immediately respond Thursday to phone and email messages seeking comment on the calls between Johnson and McMichael. The legal filing by prosecutors gave no details of any of the phone conversations. McMichael and his son, Travis McMichael, armed themselves with guns and used a pickup truck to chase 25-year-old Arbery after spotting him running in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick. A neighbor, William “Roddie” Bryan, joined the pursuit in his own truck and recorded the cellphone video of Travis McMichael blasting Arbery at close range with a shotgun. The men told police that Travis McMichael opened fire in self-defense as Arbery threw punches and tried to grab the shotgun. The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery of being a thief. Arbery was unarmed when he was killed, and police found no evidence he had stolen anything. All three men were convicted of murder  by a state court jury last November and were sentenced to life in prison. They stood trial again in federal court, with a jury convicting them in February of committing hate crimes. Sentencing in that case is scheduled for August. Johnson lost her reelection race  for district attorney in November 2020 and blamed public outrage over the delay in arrests over Arbery's death, though she denied wrongdoing. Hours after the shooting, Johnson enlisted District Attorney George Barnhill of the neighboring Waycross Judicial Circuit to meet with local police the next day and advise them on the case. Prosecutors in the misconduct case said Barnhill decided after one meeting not to seek charges. Johnson waited until after that meeting to ask the Georgia attorney general's office to appoint an outside prosecutor to oversee the case. The legal filing says Johnson called the attorney general's office three days after Arbery's death and told a paralegal Barnhill had already accepted the case. “Johnson failed to disclose, however, that Barnhill had already reviewed the case and declared the case to be self-defense,"" the legal filing said. ""Thus, Johnson effectively chose the outcome of the case despite having a conflict.” Barnhill ended up recusing himself. On April 3, 2020, when Johnson learned that Barnhill was stepping aside, there was a call from her phone to Greg McMichael, the court filing said. The final listed call between them was made on May 5, 2020, when the video of the killing got posted online. The murder trial revealed the video was leaked to a local radio station by an attorney Greg McMichael had consulted. The call consisted of Greg McMichael leaving a voicemail thanking Johnson for a referral, the legal filing said. He told her: “He’s gonna run interference for me right now, and that’s damn good advice, and I appreciate that very much.” Greg Michael and his son were arrested on murder charges two days later.

5/6/2022,"Capybaras are seen on the grass in Nordelta, Tigre, Buenos Aires province, on August 26, 2021. Credit - AFP/Getty Images Gated communities are known for their manicured lawns, swimming pools, and wealthy residents. In Argentina, they’re also known as the home of the world’s largest rodents. On a drizzly afternoon in March 2022, a family of nine capybaras—the larger ones weighing in at around 130 pounds—huddle together under the hedges that surround a famous soccer player’s mansion. Munching intently on the grass, they barely look up when approached by cars or humans. These are just a few of the hundreds of capybaras that have taken over Nordelta, a private neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, over the last two years. The capybaras have always been present here. For the first two decades after the community’s construction in 1999, they kept themselves hidden, coming out only at night and darting from trees to lakes. But that began to change in 2020. With Nordelta’s well-heeled human residents confined to their homes by Argentina’s long and strict COVID-19 lockdown, its furrier inhabitants thrived. Spreading out across now empty parks, they reproduced rapidly, boosting their numbers by 16% in one year, according to estimates by local scientists. Then, after an unusually dry winter hit Argentina in June 2021, killing much of the grass in public areas, the capybaras got even bolder, crossing roads and venturing into private gardens. “That’s where the conflict started,” says Marcelo Canton, head of communications for the Nordelta Residents Association. The capybaras—known as “carpinchos” in Argentina—ate up lawns and massacred rose bushes. They caused traffic accidents, knocking delivery drivers from their bikes. Perhaps worst of all, for a country fiercely devoted to pets, the capybaras began to face off with dogs that confronted them on their new territory, causing injuries to both sides. “Dog owners were very upset,” Canton says. “Especially because here, the dogs are mostly French Bulldogs or other small dogs. They can’t defend themselves.” In July, a group of residents went to the press, griping about a capybara “invasion” and calling for authorities to move the animals out to a nature reserve. The complaints triggered a huge backlash in both Argentine and international media. Viral posts on social media accused Nordeltans of hypocrisy, since their luxury neighborhood is built on the capybara’s historic wetland habitat, with some dubbing the animals “class warriors.” It didn’t help Nordelta’s case that capybaras are extremely cute, with goofy rectangular heads and narrow eyes that make them look permanently sleepy. But for all the anger leveled at Nordelta, the neighborhood does have a real problem on its hands: how do you deal with an influx of wildlife that wasn’t there before in densely populated urban space? Cities around the world are increasingly having to answer that question. The expansion of urban areas, combined with the intensifying effects of climate change, is destroying the forests, wetlands and other ecosystems where animals have historically thrived. And at the same time, cities have become “incredibly enriched environments,” often containing an abundance of food, water, and shelter compared to their surrounding areas, says Peter Alagona, an environmental historian and author of The Accidental Ecosystem. The result is that animals losing their natural habitats are increasingly making the city their home. Nordelta’s confrontation with capybaras is just the beginning. Alagona argues that cities are due for a fundamental rethink of their relationship with urban wildlife. “We need to start thinking about cities as multi-species communities, as potential refuges for creatures that, in the future, we may not see in natural spaces,” he says. “There’s a grand ecological rearrangement taking place and cities are part of it.” About 15 miles west of Nordelta, the grass is tall and the air is full of mosquitoes. Wildcats, lizards, and nutria (the capybara’s smaller cousin), roam unseen by humans on roughly 750 acres along the Luján River. Graciela Capodoglio, a former teacher, helped to found this nature reserve in Pilar, a suburb of Buenos Aires, in 2003, around the same time that gated communities began to proliferate around the city. Her goal was to use the space to teach city residents about the importance of protecting nature; today, the reserve is one of the region’s last natural wetlands. “With all this development, the animals have been corralled into smaller and smaller spaces,” Capodoglio says over the hum of bugs and birds. “And now, the whole country is suffering from a drought,” which further threatens the wildlife here. The clearing of tens of millions of hectares of the Brazilian Amazon and other rainforests, mainly for agriculture, has led, in the last few years, to the disappearance of South America’s “flying rivers,” which once carried moisture across the region. The drier conditions, combined with rising temperature due to climate change, have sapped food and water sources for wildlife, and helped to spread forest fires. In February, as wildfires lapped at the edges of Corrientes in the north of Argentina, newspapers published dramatic images of alligators, capybaras, and other animals fleeing the flames. Capodoglio was “furious” when she read news stories about the capybara “invasion” in Nordelta. And again, in January 2022, when similar stories popped up about an invasion of tegus—black-and-white lizards native to the region—in gated communities near the Pilar reserve. “The word invasion drives me crazy! They were here first,” she says. In pre-pandemic times, people concerned about tegus on their properties would contact animal rescue shelters to take them away. But with those centers mostly closed because of COVID-19, Capodoglio says the reserve received a rush of calls from concerned residents. “I try to explain to them that the poor tegu is an inoffensive animal,” she says, noting that the lizards, will cut off their own tails to run away from dogs or larger animals that catch them. “And it helps you keep rats out of your house! Why do we need to look at all animals as attackers? It’s such an anthropocentric view. It pisses me off.” Over in Nordelta, Canton, of the residents association, says that the group that wanted to remove all capybaras from the neighborhood was a minority of about a hundred out of some 45,000. After the media firestorm, he says, a second group of “environmentalist residents” spoke up, opposing any measures that could affect the capybaras or their urban habitat. “Then finally, a third group in the middle came up, who said ‘okay we have to respect the animals, but what are we going to do?’” In August 2021, that group made their case for some kind of intervention to the wildlife department of Buenos Aires province and in an open letter in the national press. They pointed out that capybaras had been driven almost to extinction by poachers in Tigre, the municipality where Nordelta is located, by the 1990s, and that the creation of the gated community—where hunters don’t venture—had saved the animals. But, they argued, the area “could no longer feed or sustain” today’s numbers. The province agreed, based on their observations from a visit in June, that there was an “overpopulation” problem. They then began to work with the municipal government and the Nordelta residents association—which acts almost like a local government because of Nordelta’s private status—on a plan to restore “harmonious coexistence” between capybaras and humans, according to Canton, consulting with capybara experts at Argentina’s national scientific research council, and a team of biologists hired by Nordelta. Limiting capybara numbers is part of the plan. Officials have ruled out the idea of moving some capybaras to nearby nature reserves—suggested by the residents to bring the population back to the level it stood at five years ago—on the grounds that they had not learned to fear their natural predators and wouldn’t last in the wild, Canton says. And there will, “of course,” be no culling of the animals in Nordelta, he adds. But capybara vasectomies are on the table. The province is consulting with vets before giving the greenlight for a trial, which would follow a few dominant males and monitor them for several years. A deer vasectomy program with similar goals in Staten Island has resulted in a “sizable decrease” in the deer population since 2016, but proved controversial among residents and conservationists. “That is a mid- to long-term solution,” Canton says, “and it’s the only less natural measure that’s under consideration.” For now, the focus has been on softer measures. First there was an awareness campaign, using newsletters, social media, and outreach to local press to remind residents that capybaras are generally harmless and ideally are dealt with by simply ignoring them. Next, the residents association began creating new habitats for the capybaras inside Nordelta, so they wouldn’t need to resort to gardens. The human residents stopped cutting the grass so often in public parks and near lakes, to make it more comfortable for capybaras, and left some areas on the edges of town to go wild. Then they installed three “buffer zones,” made up of reeds and bushes for the animals to shelter in, at the edges of lakes within the neighborhood. Three more are under development, along with another site at a currently polluted stream that enters Nordelta from the north. Canton says the creation of these newly rewilded areas has helped keep capybaras away from residents. The real test, though, will come in the next few months, as the dry winter season in Argentina puts pressure on the giant rodents’ food supply. As the global conversation around the importance of preserving biodiversity gets louder, many cities are trying to change their designs to enable humans and animals to share urban space in a climate-changed world. In London, for example, the largest landowners in the central West End district are adding vegetation to roofs, walls and streets to create more of the plants needed by native birds, bees and bats. Wildlife bridges, which allow animals to safely cross roads or railways that have divided parts of their habitats, are in vogue in many cities: a network of reindeer viaducts are being built across Sweden, the largest ever animal overpass is under construction in Los Angeles, and in March Houston opened a “landbridge” connecting the two sides of its Memorial park, which have been separated for a century. Even buildings are being rethought: last year, it became mandatory for new buildings in New York City to incorporate bird-friendly elements, such as patterned glass to prevent crashes. The increasing threats of flash floods, heatwaves, and drought are prompting cities to restore green space and trees, which can absorb water and regulate temperature. Local governments should recognize that animals have their own “ecosystem services” to offer, argues Alagona. Rather than employing companies to exterminate rats, for example, cities could plant more trees that are conducive to owl nesting habits, and manage power lines better to prevent owl deaths. “If we have more owls, we definitely have fewer rats,” he says. “By thinking about wildlife and coordinating across different departments, we can create an environment that’s healthier for everybody.”",World/Time,Giant Rodents 'Invaded' a Wealthy Gated Community.
