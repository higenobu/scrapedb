2/17/2022,"A data leak revealed over 92,000 donors who shelled out more than $8 million to the Freedom Convoy. Texas CEO Benjamin Pogue's email was linked to a $20,000 donation to the protest, Gizmodo reported. A spokesperson said Pogue ""has no comment on this issue."" Benjamin Pogue, the CEO of a Texas construction company and a supporter of Donald Trump, has been linked to a $20,000 donation to the ongoing vaccine mandate protests in Canada, according to multiple reports. On Sunday night, hackers leaked the names of over 92,000 donors who had given millions of dollars to the protesters known as the ""Freedom Convoy"" via GiveSendGo. Pogue is named among some of the top donors on the Christian crowd-sourcing site and his email is linked to the donation, Gizmodo and The Dallas Morning News reported. A spokesperson for Pogue told Insider that the CEO ""has no comment on this issue."" In 2020, Pogue donated over $385,000 to Trump's reelection efforts, including providing the former president with the use of Pogue's own private jet. The vaccine mandate protest has been linked to Trump supporters in multiple instances. Several news outlets have posted photos of the protest that include hats and signs referencing Trump and the slogan ""Make Canada Great Again."" Local news reported that during the first week of the protests a man was seen riding through the protesters on horseback, carrying a ""Trump 2024"" flag. Trump and several political figures, including Ben Shapiro and Rep. Majorie Taylor Green (R-GA), have expressed support for the movement. The former president said the protesters were ""doing more to defend American freedom than our own leaders by far,"" during a rally in Conroe, Texas on January 30. Vice reported that over half of the donations on the donation site originated from the US, according to the leaked data, which has since been removed online. Other major US donors that were revealed in the leak reportedly include American software billionaire and past Republican Party supporter Thomas Siebel, who donated $90,000 to the Freedom Convoy, according to the data. Siebel did not respond to a request for comment from Insider. Last week, an Ontario court held up funding for the Freedom Convoy by freezing $8.4 million that the group raised on GiveSendGo. Since then, Canadian authorities have begun targeting crypto donations to protesters. Previously, the convoy raised more than $10 million on GoFundMe until the platform shut the page down and refunded the money earlier in the month. On Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked emergency powers for the first time in Canada's history after calling the protesters a ""small fringe minority"" only a few weeks prior. The Emergencies Act allows the government to temporarily override civil rights to break up the blockades of protesters who have flooded Canada's capital and taken up blockades across the country. The Freedom Convoy has clogged city streets in Ottawa since convoys of truckers began rolling into the capital on January 21. Last week, members of the group blocked a vital bridge between Detroit and Canada, snarling international trade. Since, the protests have spread throughout the province into Windsor and Sarnia. Canada's vaccine mandate for truckers went into effect on January 15. The new rules require US truckers to present proof of vaccination to cross the border and unvaccinated Canadian truckers to get a COVID-19 test and quarantine when they reenter from the US. The US imposed a similar mandate on January 22.

2/17/2022,"(Reuters) - Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, also known as Ho Wan Kwok, filed for individual bankruptcy protection in a U.S. bankruptcy court in Bridgeport, a court filing showed. Guo listed assets in the range of $50,001 to $100,000 in the bankruptcy filing, and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. Among the list of creditors who have claims against Guo, he listed Pacific Alliance Asia Opportunity fund as the one with the largest claim of about $254 million. The fund, which sued Guo for unpaid loans worth $88 million, allegedly borrowed between 2008 and 2011, has been locked in a legal battle with him in a New York State Court over this issue for four years. In September, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fined three media companies, affiliated with Guo, $539 million on charges of illegally selling stock and digital assets to investors.

2/17/2022,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota prosecutors have apparently backed away from their pursuit of a longer-than-usual sentence for the suburban Minneapolis police officer who said she confused her handgun for her Taser when she killed Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old Black motorist. Kim Potter, 49, is scheduled to be sentenced Friday following her December conviction of first-degree manslaughter. In a court filing this week, prosecutors said a sentence of slightly more than seven years — which is the presumed penalty under the state's guidelines -- would be proper. “The presumptive sentence takes into account the main elements of the conviction: the death of Daunte Wright and Defendant’s recklessness,” prosecutor Matt Frank wrote. Potter’s attorneys are asking for less than usual, including only probation. Frank wrote that prosecutors disagree with the defense, but “the State recognizes that this is a unique case given the context in which Defendant Potter recklessly handled her firearm.” Potter was convicted of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in the April 11 killing of Wright, who was pulled over by Brooklyn Center officers for having expired license plate tags and an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror. Officers learned he had an outstanding warrant for a weapons possession charge, and he pulled away as they tried to arrest him. Video shows that Potter shouted several times that she was going to tase Wright, but she had her gun in her hand and fired one shot into his chest. Under Minnesota statutes, Potter, who is white, will be sentenced only on the most serious conviction of first-degree manslaughter. State sentencing guidelines call for a penalty ranging from slightly more than six years to about 8 1/2 years, with the presumptive sentence being just over seven years. The sentencing guidelines are advisory, but judges can’t go above or below them unless they find a compelling reason. Prosecutors initially argued that aggravating factors warranted a sentence above the guideline range. Among them, prosecutors said Potter abused her authority as an officer and that her actions caused a greater-than-normal danger to others. There is no indication in the court record that they have formally withdrawn that argument, but the document filed Tuesday indicates they are taking a new approach and now believe the presumptive sentence is appropriate. Defense attorneys, in seeking a lighter sentence, have argued that Wright was the aggressor and that he would be alive if he had obeyed commands. In their request for probation only, Potter’s attorneys said she has no prior record, is remorseful, has had an exemplary career and has the support of family and friends. They also said her risk of committing the same crime again is low because she is no longer a police officer, and they said she would do well on probation. Prosecutors disagreed with the defense's reasoning. In Tuesday's filings, Frank wrote that to sentence Potter to only probation, the judge would have to find that probation would serve society’s interests, not Potter’s, and that the defense must establish that. But Frank also said there could be some benefits to probation. Among them, Potter could speak to law enforcement groups or lawmakers about the dangers of confusing a handgun for a Taser. Frank said she could also speak to manufacturers about making design changes to avoid confusion. And, he said, she could acknowledge her failure and try to help the community heal to “honor the memory of Daunte Wright.” “No prison sentence can bring Daunte Wright back to life. A prison sentence is just a number, and that number cannot undo this tragedy or bring Daunte Wright back to his family,"" Frank wrote. “Fostering healing and community restoration is valuable too.” = Frank also disagreed with defense arguments that Potter should be given a sentence that goes below the guideline range. If the court finds that Potter's case is less serious than the typical first-degree manslaughter case, he wrote, the court should issue a sentence between four and slightly over seven years, the presumptive sentences for second-degree and first-degree manslaughter. “To impose anything less would fail to take into account Daunte Wright’s death and the jury’s finding that Defendant Potter committed first-degree manslaughter,” Frank wrote. In Minnesota, it’s presumed that convicts who show good behavior will serve two-thirds of their sentence in prison and the rest on supervised release, commonly known as parole. That means if Potter gets the roughly seven-year presumptive sentence, she would serve about four years and nine months behind bars, with the rest on parole. Potter has been at the state’s women’s prison in Shakopee since the guilty verdict. ___ Find the AP’s full coverage of the Daunte Wright case: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-daunte-wright",U.S./Associated Press,Prosecutors reduce requested sentence for ex-cop Kim Potter,https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-reduce-requested-sentence-ex-202821833.html
2/17/2022,"(Adds comments from intelligence services chief) By Andrius Sytas Feb 16 (Reuters) - Russia is continuing to move troops to the Ukrainian border and will likely launch a ""limited"" military attack against the country, the head of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service said on Wednesday. The attack would include missile bombardment and the occupation of ""key terrain"" in Ukraine, said Mikk Marran, director general of the Estonian Foreign Intelligence Service. ""Right now, our assessment is that they would avoid cities with large populations, as it takes a lot of troops to control those areas. But there is no clear understanding of what avenue the Russian troops might exploit,"" he told a media briefing held to introduce the service's annual report. Another possibility could be intensified fighting out of the two Russian-backed breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine, according to Estonian intelligence. Such escalation is ""highly likely,"" and this way “Russia likely gets plausible deniability and avoids sanctions,” said Marran. “If Russia is successful in Ukraine, it would encourage it to increase pressure on the Baltics in the coming years,"" he said. “The threat of war has become main policy tool for Putin.” Estonian intelligence is aware of approximately 10 battle groups of Russian troops moving toward the Ukrainian border, where 100 Russian military battle groups, or about 170,000 soldiers, are already deployed, the intelligence chief said. The numbers include soldiers usually deployed in regions around Ukraine, but also troops in Belarus which Russia sent for a military exercise near Ukrainian border. Some of the soldiers are likely to stay in Belarus beyond the Feb. 20 end of the exercise, a significant worry for the NATO alliance which the Baltics belong to, said Marran. ""That would reduce preparation time for an attack against the Baltics.” (Reporting by Andrius Sytas in Riga Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Leslie Adler)",World/Reuters,"UPDATE 1-Russia 'likely' to launch 'limited' military attack against Ukraine, says Estonian intelligence",https://news.yahoo.com/1-russia-likely-launch-limited-194935851.html
