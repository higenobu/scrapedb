1/28/2022,"Claims shared on social media, including by the former Brexit secretary David Davis, that the true number of deaths in England and Wales caused by Covid could be 17,000 have been debunked as “spurious” and factually incorrect by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS responded after tweets by Davis suggesting that the figure 17,371 represented the death toll in people with no other underlying causes. Davis tweeted: “Up to the end of September 2021, the official count of the deaths of people with Covid was 137,133.” He added a freedom of information (FoI) request indicated only 17,371 of those deaths occurred in people with no underlying causes.  The FoI request to the ONS asked for all deaths in which Covid had been given as the sole cause on the death certificate, which is about a tenth of the generally stated toll. James Tucker, an analyst at the ONS, said that to suggest the lower figure “represents the real extent of deaths from the virus is both factually incorrect and highly misleading”. It was common for Covid victims to have had a pre-existing health condition, but that did not mean they were at “imminent risk of dying from that condition, or even considered to have reduced life expectancy”, he wrote in a blog. Diabetes was the most common pre-existing condition for those dying from Covid, but, he wrote, “this does not mean they were at risk of dying from it”. There was a huge range of pre-existing conditions that could be listed on the death certificate, from heart disease and cancers to obesity and heart arrhythmias, he wrote. The ONS distinguished “between deaths that are ‘due to Covid-19’ and those ‘involving Covid-19’ to provide the most comprehensive information on the impact of the disease on mortality”. “More than 140,000 deaths have been due to Covid-19, meaning that it has been determined as the underlying cause. To exclude individuals with any pre-existing conditions from this figure greatly understates the number of people who died from Covid-19 and who might well still be alive had the pandemic not occurred,” he wrote. Davis appeared to have come across the statistic after watching a video he described as an “excellent summation” made by the YouTube blogger Dr John Campbell. Davis did not say that the figure represented the true pandemic toll, but described the video as “disentangling the statistics”.",News/World news,ONS debunks ‘spurious’ Covid deaths claim shared by David Davis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/ons-debunks-spurious-covid-deaths-claim-shared-by-david-davis
1/28/2022,"It’s 60 years since the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral, built alongside the ruins of the medieval one that was destroyed by bombing in 1940. The opening of the building was marked by a number of significant music commissions, including Arthur Bliss’s Beatitudes, Michael Tippett’s opera King Priam, and, most famously, Benjamin Britten’s War Requiem. And it’s Britten’s work that provides the starting point for Nitin Sawhney’s Ghosts in the Ruins, commissioned as part of Coventry’s year as UK city of culture to mark the anniversary. Promised as a site-specific work reflecting present-day Coventry’s role as a “city of sanctuary”, it proved to be disappointingly bland. The first part of the 75-minute work is performed in the new cathedral, the second among the atmospheric ruins of the old, yet it never manages to articulate the dialogue between past and present and war and peace that I suspect is intended, and much of the work has the inert feeling of a dutiful school concert.  A distant recording of the Libera me from Britten’s requiem was intended as the work’s ghostly beginning, though on the first night its effect was ruined as latecomers were still being noisily seated after it had begun. The choral setting by Sawhney that followed – very well sung by the Coventry Cathedral choir – set the tone for what is a curiously Anglican sequence, far removed from Sawhney’s usual richly varied musical palette. The choral numbers are interspersed with poems written and read by local Coventry poets, led by the city’s Poet Laureate, Emily Lauren Jones and its Young Poet Laureate, Hawwa Hussain, and interludes of pulsing ambient music from the violinist Eos Counsell and vocalist YVA, during which images from Coventry’s wartime past and hugely diverse present (assembled by Mark Murphy) were projected on to screens flanking the cathedral’s nave. It all unfolds very sedately, without a hint of drama or theatricality, but the second half, framed by the ragged walls of the old cathedral, at least offers a change of pace: a series of choral numbers over a persistent rhythm for which the cathedral choirs are joined by members of the Spires Music choir and the Choir With No Name, decorated by Counsell’s multi-tracked violin. The style is somewhere between Carl Orff’s Carmina Burana and Philip Glass’s Koyaanisqatsi. The ending, however, is perfunctory, and the total effect puzzling. It would have helped greatly to know what the texts for the choral settings were; in a work in which the words obviously matter so much, they were nowhere to be found.

1/28/2022,"During the early days of the pandemic the choice was simple: you either wore a reusable cloth mask or a disposable surgical mask. As the months have progressed, the choice of face coverings and other forms of protection has mushroomed, while the emergence of more transmissible variants has prompted some countries to mandate the wearing of full protective filtering face piece (FFP) masks in public spaces. Although face coverings are no longer legally required in England, the government has suggested continuing to wear one in crowded, enclosed spaces where you may come into contact with other people you do not normally meet.  FFP2 masks filter at least 94% of 0.3 micron particles – covering most virus-carrying respiratory aerosols that linger in the air – and, according to research published in Physics of Fluids, are typically three times more efficient at filtering larger particles, typical of those produced during speech, compared with the best three-layered cloth masks. So, is it time to ditch our cloth masks in favour of FFP2 or next-generation alternatives? And is it possible to do so without resorting to single-use masks? Reusable fabric masks are not intended to block ultra-fine particles such as virus-carrying aerosols, but they do trap larger respiratory droplets, so they are better than nothing. They also have the advantage of being washable – ideally in soapy water hotter than 60C (140F) – thus reducing waste. Even though cloth masks are less effective at filtering, “given the large number of parameters involved in disease transmission, we still don’t understand the degree to which that affects the spread of disease,” said Dr Joshua Robinson, a University of Bristol physicist who has been studying mask performance. “If people are looking to improve the performance of their cloth masks, then improving the face seal in problem areas such as around the nose will likely help.” Some FFP2 masks, such as the Cradle washable multi-use mask (pictured) or är mask, feature a silver chloride-based coating called ViralOff , claimed to destroy 99% of viral particles within two hours. This would not sterilise incoming air, but it could reduce the risk of getting virus onto your hands and transferring it elsewhere. Because the mask’s coating also destroys bacteria and fungi, it might also reduce the risk of “maskne”. Robinson points out that the quality of the filter – including the electrostatic charge on fibres, which boosts masks’ performance – is likely to degrade over time. Cradle said its mask’s ability to filter 0.3 micron particles dropped from 98.7% to 96% after 100 hours of hand washing in mild detergent at 40C, with line drying in between – meaning it would still meet FFP2 standard requirements. Helloface was founded to help deaf or hard of hearing people communicate – something conventional face masks inhibit, because they hide mouth movements and other facial cues. Its transparent medical mask is touted as an alternative to surgical masks, and contains antimicrobial and anti-fogging elements. Although it is not designed to be reworn, the plastic components are recyclable. Though you may look like Darth Vader wearing it, the UVMask is one of several masks and protective products being developed that incorporate UV-C light – a wavelength that inactivates viruses by destroying their protein coating – to purify incoming and outgoing air. It hasn’t yet received regulatory approval, so it is unclear if this concept will work – according to the US Food and Drug Administration, there is limited published data about the wavelength, dose, and duration of UVC radiation required to inactivate Sars-CoV-2. The mask also features two FFP2 filters, which will likely do all the heavy lifting, said Aaron Collins, an engineer who tests and reviews masks. In his opinion, “what you are left with is a gadget”. Though it does not say so on the packet, many mask experts claim it is safe to rewear disposable FFP2 masks – provided you take some precautions: Only rewear your own mask; dispose of it if you have been in close or prolonged contact with an infected person, or if it shows any signs of becoming clogged, harder to breather through, or if the straps or mask lose their shape – meaning it no longer forms a close seal with the face; and decontaminate it between wears. To do this, you should hang it somewhere clean and dry (not on a radiator) or store it in a breathable paper bag for 5-7 days, while you wear a different mask. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says N95 (equivalent to FFP2) masks “may be used multiple times under crisis capacity strategies” – though it recommends replacing them after five wears. “My recommendation on reuse for general public is 40 hours’ total wear time, or if the straps or mask lose their shape, affecting face fit – whichever comes first,” said Collins. Never spray masks with alcohol or disinfectant, which may damage the fibres or harm the lungs, or put disposable masks in the washing machine, tumble-dryer, microwave or a hot oven, which may also damage the fibres. According to research at FH Münster University in Germany, foldable FFP2 masks can be safely decontaminated by heating them in an oven at 80C for 60 minutes, or by sealing them in a freezer bag and boiling them for 10 minutes – although the elastic straps may become damaged, so should be checked. Air purifiers have long been used in hospital operating theatres to reduce the risk of post-surgery infections, but portable units are increasingly being deployed in schools and care homes on the assumption that they will similarly reduce the risk of coronavirus infections. Although they have been shown to reduce the amount of virus in the air – in some cases to undetectable levels – such studies have been small, and have not yet proved that air purifiers reduce the risk of infection, to what degree, or how best to deploy them. “They may well work, but we need [this information] to make some sensible, rational, evidence-based decisions,” said Prof Alastair Hay at the University of Bristol, who is leading a study of portable air purifiers in care homes. He stressed that the presence of an air purifier should not be an excuse to relax other protective measures. “If it turns out that the other behaviours are the ones that are really doing the heavy lifting, then you could end up causing harm,” he said.",News/World news,Is it time to ditch cloth face masks for FFP2 or next-generation alternatives?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/cloth-face-masks-ffp2-or-next-generation-alternatives-covid

The base has become one of the Ukrainian army’s positions on the frontline  The frontline in the Donbas region has been more or less settled from Luhansk to Mariupol and the Black Sea since the Minsk II agreements in 2015. Though the conflict never ended, it had given way to an ongoing war of attrition, relying on trenches and shelling. But since the end of 2021, the words of Vladimir Putin and the movement of more than 120,000 Russian troops to the border have raised fears of an escalation of the conflict. Ukrainian soldiers walk through the former Zenit military airbase Ukrainian soldiers in an underground position in the city of Avdiivka After having witnessed the evolution of the conflict year after year, Herbaut noticed during his last trip, from 17 to 23 January, a flagrant change compared with the previous eight years and even compared to his last visit in November: the daily exchange of gunfire, the targeted bombings, the threat of snipers and the attacks from drones equipped with grenades had decreased, and life in the trenches was disturbingly calm for the soldiers on the frontline. Like the calm before the storm.

1/28/2022,"Emily has it in Paris. So does her frenemy Camille, and her boss, Sylvie. Carrie has it in And Just Like That – as does Lisa, who has replaced Samantha as Sex and the City’s fourth Beatle. Moira and Alexis both had it in Schitt’s Creek, and it was on every other lounger in White Lotus. Every woman on television right now has the exact same hair: straight from the crown to the top of the cheekbone, and then wavy to the ends. It has been around for a while, this hair – Laura Dern had it in Big Little Lies, and Sandra Oh flirted with it on Killing Eve. But after a month of the in-depth sofa-based research otherwise known as Dry January, I can confirm that it has reached a new level of ubiquity.  It does not feel likely that And Just Like That – Sex and the City’s midlife sequel – will be remembered as a high water mark of popular culture, but the capitulation of Carrie to mermaid waves represents the moment when this hairstyle became the shampoo-and-set of the 21st century. The bubble curls of the original Carrie Bradshaw were an iconic look in their own right – but they could not survive the reboot. This is not just a telly thing, this hair. It is very much the go-to look for public-facing real-life glamour. It works for day or night, whether you are going to a nice restaurant or giving a Ted Talk. Everyone has this hair (me included, see?), which is weird, because actually no one has this hair. There is no hair type that is naturally straight at the top and bendy at the bottom. Sure, if you have slightly wavy and preternaturally well-behaved hair and you tie it in a bun and then let it down a couple of hours later, you might, once in a blue moon, get this perfect combination of hair that drapes elegantly from your parting, then springs into bouncy, face-flattering width at the exact right point. But you can bet your bottom dollar that this would happen when you had just got home and changed into your pyjamas, or moments before you got drenched in a rainstorm, not the night you were going to a party. You won’t get it naturally, but you can make it happen quite easily. The key to the look is its relatability. Barrel tongs and straighteners are part of everyday life for many of us, me included, so if you can wind a clump of hair around a metal stick (like spaghetti on a fork) and count to 10, you can pull off a school-gate-passable version of this Netflix glamour in the time it takes to listen to the news headlines. And because your loops of hair are marshalled into biggish chunks, they tend to behave themselves. This is another reason why this is television hair: high fashion has tended to prefer the kind of poker-straight hair that requires a full-time team of stylists on alert for gaps and strays, but straight-to-wavy can bounce through several takes and keep looking presentable. The lacquered ringlets which were once shiny bullets in the weaponised femininity of The Apprentice and Fox News have evolved into this shape, somehow more low-key and more sophisticated. Hairdresser George Northwood, godfather of the coolest hair, has been perfecting this look on Alexa Chung and a million Alexa-wannabes for years.

1/28/2022,"There is art that mirrors life, life mirroring art – and then there is Station Eleven. In February 2020, filming was under way on an HBO Max adaptation of the critically acclaimed novel, which is set 20 years after a deadly flu outbreak has decimated the global population and brought civilisation as we know it to an end. Its plot centres on a nomadic troupe of actors who perform Shakespeare to the scattered settlements of the Great Lakes. But after shooting two episodes showing the “Georgia flu” bringing the city of Chicago to a stop, production was shut down by the very threat it depicted. The book, which was a bestseller in 2014, was discovered anew as the real-life pandemic made us seek out stories to help process the emergent threat. (See the spike in streams of Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 pandemic thriller Contagion; the return of Camus.) Its author, Emily St John Mandel, is often declared to have “predicted” the future, a claim she resists.  “There are tiers of how much it blew your mind,” says Station Eleven star Mackenzie Davis by phone from Los Angeles. “Talking about a virus making its way round the world from Asia to Europe to Chicago, and then halting production to let that actual event happen – it was really quite chilling.” If the collapse of fact and fiction was coincidental to the book, it is inherent to the show – and the source of its substantial pathos. Premiering in the UK this week but recently concluded in the US, it has been hailed as a rare uplifting story of the pandemic. Its creator, Patrick Somerville (who also wrote revered post-apocalyptic drama The Leftovers), describes it as: “a post-apocalyptic show about joy”. “That’s something I really love about the show … because why survive, if it’s just misery?” says Davis – who is perhaps best known for the Black Mirror episode San Junipero. She plays Kirsten, the Traveling Symphony troupe’s star player, in “year 20” when the threat of the virus is long past and post-pandemic civilisation has stabilised. “There has to be something that pushes you to want to live through extreme difficulty and tragedy – and it has to include laughter and joy.” The events of the 10 episodes tell a story that is extremely nonlinear. Narratives are looping and layered, with the present intruded upon by memories of “year zero”. When the Georgia flu arrives in Chicago, Kirsten is eight years old and acting in a production of King Lear alongside movie star Arthur Leander (Gael García Bernal). Arthur dies on stage, and in the ensuing confusion Kirsten is taken in by audience member Jeevan (Himesh Patel, also seen having a panic attack about the end of the world in Don’t Look Up) and his brother Frank (Nabhaan Rizwan). Meanwhile, Arthur’s ex-wife Miranda (Danielle Deadwyler) has completed her graphic novel, years in the making, about a stranded spaceman – titled Station Eleven. As society collapses, characters shape each others’ fates in ways that take decades to be uncovered. If these connections sometimes seem dependent on coincidence, they are consistent with how many of us experienced the pandemic: how small our worlds became, the fluidity of past and present. The surrealness of that time still weighs on Davis. “It’s all strange,” she says. “I mean, I keep finding myself in conversations being like: ‘How’s your pandemic? What have you been doing for the last few years?’ Just sort of catching yourself, like, wow, we’re using the word ‘pandemic’ colloquially – the casualness – as a unit of time.” In the “infinite void” of quarantine, Davis – who holed up with a friend in LA – kept feeling overtaken by memories of places she had once been and past homes. (Davis, 34, is Vancouver-born, but moved from LA to London later in 2020.) “I just kept feeling shuttled back in time, or to other planes of time where I was still living other lives.” Restarting production on Station Eleven in Toronto in February 2021 – drawing on the recent past, projecting far into the future – blurred her reality even further. “This show was like a living document while we were making it … it felt like excavating the present, in a weird way,” says Davis. As well as the looping timeline, multiple episodes were shot simultaneously, “so I didn’t have the comfort of thinking: this is a whole narrative with a beginning, middle and end that I fully understand,” she says. “It was weird to explore your relationship to this big, traumatic event when it was still going on, and you had no idea what part of it you were in.” I found the year zero episodes especially hard to watch, bringing back memories of those weeks in March 2020 when the situation was as fast-moving as it was uncertain; that exhausting oscillation between (as Jeevan succinctly puts it) “it’s going to be OK” and “we’re fucked”. The parallels are often painful: the emptied airports, the thwarted goodbyes, the shortcomings of language. “We need new words,” a woman tells Jeevan, struggling to articulate her relationship to the man she hopes to be reunited with. Depicting a pandemic while actually living it was “an emotionally fraught time”, says Davis. “There were a lot of open, aching hearts.” The further out from year zero Station Eleven gets, however, the similarities fall away. The Georgia flu quickly ravages the globe, with a survival rate of one in 1,000. In year 20, the trauma of those so-called “first 100” days distinguishes the “pre-pans” from the “post-pans”: the first generation to be born with no memory of the “before”. They press Kirsten for her recollections of smartphones, Uber, the internet. They weren’t that great, she tells them (though she admits she liked Instagram). What does endure through the collapse of civilisation is art: not just Shakespeare but Independence Day, Lisa Loeb, TLC. Even at the violent onset of the pandemic, the instinct to sing, write, stage plays, watch films is as strong as it is to survive. The young Kirsten clings to Miranda’s self-published graphic novel Station Eleven, its spaceman protagonist’s wistful recollections of a faraway home and the “sweetness of life on Earth” allowing her both to escape her circumstances and process them. “When I read it, it didn’t matter that the world was ending, because it was the world,” she says in year 20, still quoting the story like scripture. This vision of the post-apocalypse is certainly more peaceful than most, with civilisation rebuilt round art and community. The motto of the Traveling Symphony (lifted from Star Trek: Voyager) is “Survival is insufficient”; in humanity and the humanities, Station Eleven suggests, we find something worth living for. “I like how the show is earnest about the importance of art. It’s not cloying or masturbatory, but it makes the case that creation, for no reason or accolade, is essential to being alive, and I think that’s true,” says Davis. Kirsten even fulfils her dream of becoming an actor, Davis points out – despite, and because of, her traumatic past. “She figured out how to do it after the world collapsed. There’s something really beautiful about that sort of resilience … You’re always pursuing the thing that makes your heart beat.” It is a comforting view of the future – but, she adds, humanity’s enormous capacity to adapt is so often applied to the wrong ends. “I think about the space exploration that occurred last year, despite our planet being under the biggest natural threat we’ve ever experienced. This progress at all costs … it’s at the expense of accepting reality.” Indeed, one criticism of Station Eleven the novel was that it made surviving the apocalypse look too easy, with Sigrid Nunez writing in the New York Times in 2014 that Mandel depicted less suffering than the present day. But the author has said she intended Station Eleven as an appreciation of the best of our world, as much as the story of its end: “a love letter in the form of a requiem”. Whether its vision of a post-pandemic society could arise from our present depends on what we decide to save – you could say we get the apocalypse we deserve. For now, Station Eleven might be the closest we come to closure. “We tell ourselves stories in order to live,” says Davis, quoting the late US writer Joan Didion. “It’s not always beautiful stories, but we crave the sense that there’s some narrator taking care of us, and seeing us through to the end. Because, at the end, things are OK.” The end might be a way off yet, though. Davis feels the desire for the pandemic to be past, to “declare the end of a thing that isn’t over, because then we can start telling the story of this time … But it’s not a text: it’s not going to end one day, and life gets back to normal. It’s going to bleed into our lives. We’re going to be altered by this for ever.” Station Eleven is on StarzPlay from Sunday 30 January",Arts/Television & radio,An uplifting pandemic drama?

1/28/2022,"The latest Covid-19 vaccination figures show that almost 37 million people in the UK have received their booster jabs, with approximately 52 million people having had their first vaccination and about 48 million their second. But even though huge numbers of the population have had the booster vaccination, a significant proportion of people are still unsure or hesitant about receiving it. Here, we look into concerns around the booster, and find out why it’s so vital to have it. Who can have the booster?Everyone aged 16 and over is now eligible for a booster vaccine. Also, 12-15-year-olds who are clinically vulnerable are now able to get their booster.  Why should I get the booster vaccine?It’s important we take up all vaccinations offered, including boosters, since they deliver the best possible protection against the virus, significantly reducing our risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. Research shows that unvaccinated people are eight times more likely to be hospitalised than those who have had both doses of the vaccine and a booster. And because the booster vaccine lessens our chances of contracting the virus, it also lessens our chances of suffering from long Covid, which can have serious and debilitating long-term effects. A&E doctor Dr Emeka Okorocha says: “I have seen firsthand the effect that Covid-19 can have on people – you can still get seriously ill with the virus. Covid-19 is highly infectious and the vaccine remains our best line of defence against it.” Is the booster jab actually effective against the Omicron variant?Yes, it is effective. “Two doses of the vaccine are very good at protecting against the Delta variant but, as we know, the dominant variant now is Omicron,” says Dr Viki Male, a reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London. “With Omicron, a third dose boosts protection against hospitalisation up to around 90%,” she says. Dr Lucy Pocock, an academic GP at the University of Bristol, agrees about the benefits. “It is true that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with Omicron is lower than with the Delta variant, however protection against hospitalisation is much greater after a booster dose, so it’s really important people take them up when they are offered.” I’m concerned about the side-effects of the vaccine. Is the booster safe?Yes, the booster has been approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). “In the UK, most people are offered an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) as a booster,” says Pocock. “Millions of people worldwide have now received doses of these vaccines with the risk of serious side-effects being very low. Symptoms people have experienced – such as short-term pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue or a headache – are usually mild and only last for a couple of days.” If, on the other hand, you test positive for Covid-19, you may need to take significant time off work to isolate and recover from the illness. I had my second dose of the vaccine not long ago. When can I get a booster vaccine?You can get a Covid-19 booster vaccine three months after your second dose. “If you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had Covid-19, remember to book your booster jab 28 days after you no longer have the virus too,” says Okorocha. I am immunosuppressed and more vulnerable to infection. What should I do?In certain circumstances – for example, for people who are immunosuppressed – it’s even more important you are protected against the virus. In which case, you may be eligible to receive a booster vaccination sooner. If you haven’t had yours, go to the NHS.uk website to book an appointment or to find your local walk-in vaccination centre. I’ve already had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, am I not protected enough?Unfortunately not. Taking up a booster will strengthen protection against serious illness from Covid-19 and give you the best possible defence for you, your family and anybody you come into contact with. I’m pregnant and I’m concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine. Why should I get it?If you’re pregnant, it’s even more important you take up the booster as soon as you can. Research shows that pregnant and recently pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit than non-pregnant women. Data from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System also indicates that 96% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms between May and October 2021 were unvaccinated, and a third of these required respiratory support. About one in five pregnant women hospitalised with the virus need to deliver babies preterm, and one in five of their babies need care in the neonatal unit. “Along with a higher risk of preterm birth for women with symptomatic Covid-19, UK studies have also suggested a higher rate of stillbirth in infected women,” says Pocock. But does research indicate that it’s definitely safe if I’m pregnant?Yes, it does. “Safety trials of the booster have shown that, in the general population, the booster doesn’t have any side effects that we don’t see with doses one and two,” says Male. “Safety studies looking at more than 100,000 people who received doses one and two during pregnancy have shown that there’s no increased risk of pregnancy complications with the vaccines. Putting those two together, we have every reason to believe that, just like doses one and two, boosters are completely safe during pregnancy.” Pocock agrees, saying: “The Covid-19 vaccines are safe for pregnant women and have no impact on fertility, either.” I don’t have time to get a booster jab, is it really that important?The Covid-19 vaccine is quick, simple and free. It has never been easier to get jabbed – you can get it near your home or work, and at a time that’s convenient (including the weekend or evenings). Either book online or visit a walk-in centre – and encourage friends and family who haven’t had theirs to book in, too. “It can be difficult to make time in a busy schedule for the booster,” says Pocock. “But having symptomatic Covid-19, or even long Covid, is likely to be much more disruptive to your life. Appointments are on offer on weekends and evenings, and are quick and easy. Think of it as an investment in your health and future productivity.” Get your booster now by visiting nhs.uk/covidvaccination.

Zhang, who used a pseudonym, has been inside a bubble since 21 January. “With the buses, going out is easy,” he told the Guardian. “It [the loop] doesn’t affect how we work much but it affects our lives, especially meals, and life is not as free as outside the loop.” Throughout the pandemic, China’s government has maintained, with large success, a “zero-Covid” strategy, assisted by strict border controls. As recently as a few months ago, weeks would go by with no community cases, and outbreaks were swiftly brought under control. But then Omicron arrived. Case numbers are low relative to the rest of the world but infections have been found in multiple provinces and cities, including Beijing. The closed loop system is now tasked not only with keeping the Games as Covid-free as possible but also ensuring that the influx of about 11,000 foreign athletes, officials, employees and guests does not spark a wider outbreak that China cannot control. The “closed loop” system designed for the Games consists of three interconnected competition zone bubbles, where participants and employees will work or compete, eat and sleep, without ever coming into contact with the general population. The first covers Beijing’s city centre and the venues for ice competitions and the opening and closing ceremonies. The second is the suburban Yanqing site for Alpine skiing, snowmobile, and sledding events, and the third is way out in Zhangjiakou, 200km (125 miles) to the north-west in Hebei province, for the Nordic biathlon, freestyle skiing and snowboarding events. Each holds a number of stadiums and venues, convention centres, and dozens of designated hotels, and are linked by high-speed rail with designated loop carriages, and highways with dedicated loop lanes. Other drivers who cross into these lanes face fines, and people have been warned against rushing to assist if a loop vehicle has a crash. The process for foreign participants starts long before they get to Beijing. For two weeks before departure they are required to monitor and upload their temperature and other information to a health app every day. After receiving two negative Covid tests within 24 hours, they will get on a dedicated plane. When they disembark in Beijing they will be met by workers in biohazard suits. “In the airport it’s a bit scary, it’s almost like a hospital that was treating Covid patients in the second wave,” one journalist told Associated Press. Participants will go through dedicated gates and receive their third test, before one of about 4,000 special vehicles takes them to their bubble, and a hotel barricaded from the public. They will be policed and protected by officers who have gone through three weeks of quarantine and isolation, and assisted by thousands of staff such as Zhang, who will have to quarantine again before they can go home. In at least one venue, employees are wearing underarm thermometers that sound an alarm if their temperature rises too high. A participant who tests positive goes to an isolation centre for quarantine, or hospital if they are sick. It might start with a midnight knock on the door. The isolation rooms are about 25 sq metres and have an openable window. People staying in the rooms will get three meals a day and free wifi, according to the Games playbook, and they will be there for at least 10 days. If they are not showing symptoms and tests show a low viral load for three consecutive days, they can rejoin the closed loop under the measures for close contacts. People found to be close contacts and whose jobs can be done by someone else must go to the isolation centre for at least 21 days, or leave China within 24 hours of testing negative. If their job is critical or they are a competitor, they must isolate in their room, travel to competitions alone, train in their room or an isolated space, and be tested every day, including six hours before their event. So far just a few athletes have tested positive since arriving in Beijing. Some, such as the US bobsledder Josh Williamson, caught Covid while still at home. Williamson is hoping to recover and test negative in time to get to Beijing for his team’s event on 15 February. “Isn’t it ironic,” he said recently, “that after four years of hard work, all there is to do is sit, rest, recover and have faith? Things I struggle to do the most.” Tokyo’s Summer Olympics were also run under extraordinary pandemic measures, but foreigners were allowed to travel around the city after two weeks. At the end of Beijing’s Games everyone will be sent straight back home on a plane without detours. For some of the visiting foreigners the closed loop is a frustrating experience – so close and yet so far from life outside. Zhang says he is happy about the measures and supports China’s effort in combating Covid, but he is worried about the added complexities and influx of people. Outbreaks and lockdowns are still happening around the country. Beijing has shown no sign of changing its zero-Covid strategy and is banking its international and domestic reputation on the closed loop system and staging a successful, outbreak-free Olympics.

1/28/2022,"If you’d like to make more of what you know in 2022, look no further. The Department for Education’s new further education (FE) teacher recruitment campaign and digital service aims to attract skilled industry professionals from a number of key sectors – including construction, engineering and manufacturing, legal, finance and accounting, digital/IT and health and social care. FE is study, usually for learners 16+, that takes place after secondary school in FE colleges and other providers. It can be the next step for young people and school leavers but is equally accessible to adults looking to broaden their skills or change careers. There are a wide range of subjects on offer, with a unique offering of technical and vocational courses that aim to equip learners with practical, work-based skills.  So, if you have industry experience, the FE sector is actively looking to recruit people like you to pass on your knowledge and experience to the next generation of learners, and help prepare them for the world of work. Sounds interesting? Here are six of the top benefits to teaching in FE … Your industry skills are totally transferableYour skills are more valuable than you realise. Real-world industry experience is highly valued for FE teaching roles – in fact, it’s exactly what FE employers are looking for. As many of the courses are technical, they are usually quite hands-on, so you can directly apply your industry expertise to a new role. From practical know-how to workplace etiquette, all are considered to be transferable and relevant to teaching in FE. You can teach in FE alongside your current jobIndustry professionals can continue their current job alongside FE teaching, as part-time and flexible contracts are readily available. Flexible contracts enable FE teachers to continue to stay fully up to date in the industry they’re passionate about while taking advantage of the unique benefits of FE teaching. In fact, according to the 2018-2019 Further Education Workforce Data for England report, 46% of FE teachers at colleges and 43% at other providers work part-time. You can earn while you trainYou can jump right into teaching in FE. You don’t always need prior teaching qualifications or experience, and funding is available for some subjects so that new teachers can start earning straight away and train on the job. For example, the government-funded Taking Teacher Further programme covers the cost for new industry recruits to undertake training while they work. You don’t always need a degreeIf you want to teach an FE course that relates to your industry – such as an apprenticeship in construction – you won’t necessarily need a degree. The real-world skills you have gained working in the sector can often be accepted in the absence of a degree in your subject area. You can use your experience to change livesIf you like the idea of changing lives without changing your career, look no further. Becoming an FE teacher means that you will be training the next generation of workers in your sector, and passing on your knowledge and experience to future talent. It can be hugely rewarding and give you the opportunity to make a real difference in both a personal and professional capacity. You can shape the course, showcase your skills and experience, and help prepare your students for bright and fulfilling careers. There are FE teaching roles, right now, near you!There are thousands of publicly funded FE providers in England, including colleges, which means there is almost definitely an FE teaching job available somewhere near you. You can also work in adult and community education centres, prisons and youth offender organisations and voluntary organisations.

1/28/2022,"Perhaps you’re an engineer. Or a social worker. Or a lawyer, or a care worker, or an accountant. You’ve worked in your industry for a number of years and now you’re thinking about a change. Maybe you’d like to share your skills with the next generation, reinvigorate your enthusiasm for the job, or even just move away from unsociable working hours. If any of those apply, then a career in further education (FE) teaching could be for you. The beauty of teaching in FE is that it doesn’t have to be all or nothing: you can even teach alongside your current job. The skills you’ve honed over many years will be of just as much value in your new role, as the knowledge gained in industry is an integral part of the job.  Sounds interesting? Here’s everything you need to know … So what exactly is FE?FE is study, usually for learners 16+, that takes place after secondary school. It can be the next step for young people and school leavers, but is equally accessible to adults looking to broaden their skills or change careers. FE providers include (but are not limited to) sixth-form or specialist colleges, prisons and independent training providers, and there are a wide range of subjects and qualifications on offer, with a unique choice of technical and vocational courses that aim to equip learners with practical, work-based skills. Students can gain qualifications in a broad range of subjects, including engineering, manufacturing, construction and trades, legal, finance and accountancy, digital and IT, and health and social care – to name but a few. FE offers qualifications across many different levels, from basic literacy and numeracy to advanced and higher education qualifications in traditional academic subjects. The recently introduced T-levels are studied for in FE, for example. These two-year courses, equivalent to three A-levels, are delivered by FE providers in partnership with local employers and are accepted as qualifications for university admissions. They range in subject area from healthcare science to building services engineering. Apprenticeships also fall under FE. Combining work-based training with an employer with teaching at an FE college or other provider, they prepare students for work and can lead to a variety of qualifications, from chartered surveyor to data technician. What does being an FE teacher entail?Vocational – ie courses closely related to jobs – can be taught by people who have hands-on experience of what they’re talking about. This is where you could come in. Teaching in FE is an opportunity to change lives without changing your career, by sharing your industry skills with others. Depending on the subject, you might be based in the classroom, a laboratory or a workshop. You might even do some of your teaching on the premises of employers where your students are undergoing work experience. From day one, your students will be reaping the benefits of your expertise – and you’ll be learning too. In fact, many FE teachers find that their students’ questions not only keep them on their toes, but also reignite their passion for their industry. A student who wants a career in healthcare or engineering, for example, will best learn what’s really involved in those jobs from someone who has recent – or current – experience of them. FE providers are equipped with specialist facilities such as science labs, engineering workshops and even hospital wards, so much of the teaching is as hands-on as it can get. The other great thing about teaching in FE is the readily available part-time contracts, giving you flexibility over the number of hours you work. In FE, you can work full-time, part-time, evenings, or even on a casual, hourly basis. If you want the best of both worlds, you can continue with your existing job while teaching part-time. So, how do you become an FE teacher?Unlike becoming a schoolteacher, as long as you have appropriate industry experience, you may not need a degree or teaching qualification to get started. FE employers will usually want you to work towards a teaching qualification, but there is support in place so you can train on the job. For example, there are programmes that cover the cost for new industry recruits to undertake teacher training while they work as a salaried teacher, such as the government-funded Taking Teaching Further programme. You may also be offered the opportunity to do a teaching apprenticeship which will combine training alongside your teaching responsibilities. Alternatively, you could choose to train in your own time before getting a job in FE if that feels like a better fit for you. What can you expect from a career in FE?People who have made the switch talk about the variety of the job, the satisfaction of passing on skills, and the energising feeling that comes from spending time with people who are committed and enthusiastic. When you’ve reached the stage of feeling comfortable in a well-established industry career, starting a new – or secondary – career as an FE teacher is the perfect way to challenge yourself and make the most of what you know. Passing your skills on to a new generation can be invigorating, inspiring and, quite possibly, the most rewarding thing you’ll ever do.

1/28/2022,"They sang, recited poems and reminisced fondly about that wonderful winter’s day when the town of Port Talbot woke to find that a mural by the street artist Banksy had materialised on the walls of a steelworker’s garage. Three years on the piece, Season’s Greetings, is on the brink of leaving this industrial corner of south Wales and residents gathered to bid farewell to an artwork they have come to love.  “We knew this day would come,” said Bev Simmonds-Owen, one of the organisers of a candle-lit vigil arranged to mark the end of an era. “We’ve been lucky to have it for three years and wherever it goes it will always be the Port Talbot Banksy. It will stay in our hearts.” A local poet, Derek Davies, performed his bittersweet piece: Port Talbot’s Got a Banksy. Children sang Little Snowflake, the tune Banksy’s people dubbed over video footage of the mural. Speeches were made calling for it to be left in Port Talbot. But Simmonds-Owen preferred to be optimistic, pointing out that the Banksy had given a huge boost to the cultural life the town, prompting others to take up spray cans and leading to the creation of an ever-expanding street art trail. “We can claim to be the street art capital of Wales. We may not have the funding to build a big fancy art gallery, but we have the power to turn our streets into a gallery,” she said. “Port Talbot has a reputation of being an industrial town, a grey town, the colour of concrete, the colour of steel. But I think it’s a beautiful thing to make it a colourful town.” The Banksy appeared just before Christmas 2018 in the Taibach area of the town, close to the Tata steelworks (and the childhood home of Richard Burton). From one angle it shows a child apparently enjoying a snow shower and trying to catch the flakes on their tongue. From another it becomes clear that what is falling on the child is ash. Tens of thousands of people visited. Round-the-clock security had to be introduced to protect the artwork and it created a cottage industry in souvenirs – mugs, coasters, keyrings – carrying images of the work. The Essex art dealer John Brandler bought the piece from the garage owner and in May 2019 the Banksy, all 4.5-tonnes of it, was moved to a former police station in the town. But the owner of the building now wants its space back and Neath Port Talbot council is not prepared to meet the cost of transferring it to another venue. Any day now the Banksy will be trucked out of Wales. Brandler said he was sad it was having to leave Wales and said it may next surface in the east of England, or could even head out of the UK. There are some who argue the council should do more. The Plaid Cymru councillor Nigel Hunt said if his party was in power they would buy the Banksy and build a gallery around it. “Banksy is a modern master,” he said. “For this town to lose such a wonderful piece of art is a travesty.” So many people have a story about the piece. Steve Bevan, a decorator, was passing on his bicycle on the morning of the Banksy’s appearance when he saw a member of the artist’s team filming drone footage. “I nearly fell off my bike when I saw it,” he said. At the vigil Bevan sang his song Black Smoke, honouring Banksy and the public health theme the mural highlights. Paul Jenkins, a Cardiff theatre director, has been collecting reactions to Port Talbot for a play telling the story of the town’s Banksy and has secured funding for ARTwalk, which has given a platform for local artists and has also commissioned works from internationally renowned artists such as the Bristol-based HazardOne, who has created a mural of Richard Burton and is set to do one of another Hollywood star who hails from Port Talbot, Michael Sheen. “We feel the Banksy has opened the door for Port Talbot,” said Jenkins. “There’s no reason why Port Talbot can’t be known for art and creativity as well as industry.” The local street artist Steve Jenkins has just finished a mural on the garage used by Banksy . Called Speedings Greetings, it draws attention to the air quality problems caused by vehicles on the nearby M4. “There is a sadness that it is going,” he said. “Many in this area feel it belongs in Port Talbot, but there are plenty of local artists that will help out brightening up the town.”",Arts/Art and design,‘It will stay in our hearts’: Port Talbot prepares to bid farewell to its Banksy,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/28/port-talbot-prepare-bid-farewell-banksy-mural-seasons-greetings-taken-from-industrial-town-wales
1/28/2022,"Hewlett-Packard has won its civil fraud trial against Mike Lynch, after the US firm claimed that the man once hailed as Britain’s answer to Bill Gates duped it into paying £8.2bn for his software firm Autonomy. The verdict, handed down at the high court by Mr Justice Hildyard, comes on the same day as a deadline for home secretary, Priti Patel, to decide whether Lynch can be extradited to the US to face a criminal fraud trial there.  “Claimants have substantially succeeded in their claims in this proceeding,” the judge said. He said the damages were likely to be significantly less than the $5bn claimed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and successor companies. HP claimed it was induced into overpaying for the takeover by fraud perpetrated by Lynch and a key lieutenant. In separate proceedings, Lynch is still awaiting a ruling from the Home Office on whether he can be extradited to the US, where he is accused of defrauding investors in HP over the £8.2bn deal in 2011. A year after the takeover, HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by almost $9bn and claimed that Lynch and his team had falsely inflated the value of the company through accounting trickery. A London court ruled last July that Lynch, who denies any wrongdoing, should be extradited. A US trial would cover much of the same ground as the London civil case.",News/Business,Hewlett-Packard wins civil fraud case against Mike Lynch over Autonomy sale,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/28/hewlett-packard-wins-civil-case-against-mike-lynch-over-autonomy-sale
1/28/2022,"Italian police are trying to catch a suspected thief by fingerprinting a digit he accidentally cut off on barbed wire while fleeing the scene of a robbery, although they hope the suspect will surrender in the hopes of retrieving his lost wedding ring. The injured man sent a friend back to the area, a recycling plant in Milan, to search for his body part and the ring, but the friend was spotted by a security guard rummaging through leaves, local media reported.  When the guard at the plant asked him what he was doing, he reportedly responded calmly: “I’m here for a friend, I’m looking for his finger with a ring on it.” Before police could arrive, the man escaped with an accomplice who had been waiting in a nearby parked car. The finger, or specifically two phalanges of a right ring finger, were found poking out of rubbish close to the fence of the recycling plant a little later, but without the ring, according to Corriere della Sera newspaper. It was not clear if the police had since found the ring. In CCTV images captured from the night before, two men were seen climbing over the fence of the recycling plant, only to abandon their attempted break-in after being spotted by a security guard who activated the alarm. As they clambered back over a gate, one of the men got his finger entangled in the barbed wire. The digit is being kept at a morgue while police work to identify its owner through the fingerprint ID system. It is not the first time a thief in Italy has been injured during an attempted burglary. In October last year a man who tried to imitate the suave master thief in the French TV series Lupin injured his arm while smashing through the glass door of the church oratory he was attempting to burgle.",News/World news,Police take prints from severed finger in hunt for suspected thief ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/28/italian-police-hope-to-catch-thief-after-taking-prints-of-severed-finger
