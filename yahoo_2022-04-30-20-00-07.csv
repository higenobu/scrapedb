4/30/2022,"A first-class Delta passenger is accused of hurling homophobic abuse and assaulting a flight attendant. The passenger, said a criminal complaint, became angry after being refused an alcoholic drink. The passenger told FBI agents that his self-professed ""homophobia"" may have caused his temper to escalate. A passenger was arrested after he hurled homophobic abuse at a Delta Air Lines flight attendant and physically assaulted him on a flight from Atlanta, Georgia, to Phoenix, Arizona, last Friday, according to a criminal complaint. Christopher Alexander Morgan, who was seated in the first-class section of the plane, became disruptive before takeoff when he refused to comply with instructions to put his seat upright and to wear a seatbelt, the complaint said. Morgan became increasingly unruly after a flight attendant refused to serve him a second alcoholic beverage and instead offered a non-alcoholic drink, according to the complaint. Morgan is then alleged to have hurled a glass of ice at the flight attendant and shouted homophobic abuse at him, using the F-slur and calling him a ""queer,"" the complaint said. Morgan was aggressive towards another passenger who tried to de-escalate the situation, according to the complaint. The flight attendant informed the pilot about Morgan's behavior, using a telephone near the cockpit, the complaint said. Morgan is accused of grabbing the phone and using it to strike the flight attendant in the chest. Another passenger heard him repeat the F-slur, according to the complaint. The complaint said that Morgan told FBI agents that the flight attendant was gay and that this made him feel ""uncomfortable."" 'Morgan said that he is homophobic and that it is possible he could have been intimidating to the flight attendants,"" the complaint reads. ""He said that his homophobia may have caused his temper towards the flight attendant to escalate,"" it continued. Morgan admitted to FBI agents that he called the flight attendant ""queer"" but denies physically assaulting him, per the complaint. In a statement to Insider, a Delta Air Lines spokesperson said that Morgan was met by law enforcement officers when he arrived in Arizona. ""Delta has zero-tolerance for unruly behavior and discrimination at our airports and aboard our aircraft and takes all reports of such behavior seriously, especially when directed at our employees,"" the statement said. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our people and our customers."" Morgan faces a charge of interference with a flight crew member, court records show. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 3.

4/30/2022,"The commanding officer of the USS George Washington told his crew Thursday that the Navy will begin to move sailors off of the aircraft carrier following a string of suicides and complaints from service members about conditions aboard the ship, whose projected departure from the shipyards has been pushed back once again. Capt. Brent Gaut announced that the ship will move 260 sailors ""to an offsite barracks-type living arrangement on Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth"" -- specifically, a Navy Gateway Inn and Suites -- starting Monday, according to a recording of the announcement reviewed by Military.com. ""We'll be able to expand that number at about 50 additional beds per week as we figure out exactly what is needed,"" Gaut continued. Read Next: Troops at Remote and Overseas Bases Attempt Suicide More Often, GAO Finds The Navy confirmed the plan when asked by Military.com and a spokesperson added that the moves will continue “until all Sailors who wish to move off-ship have done so.” The moves comes at the end of a month that saw three sailors aboard the ship die via suicide, after a previously undisclosed string of suicides going back to at least July of last year. Military.com has been able to confirm at least five suicides by sailors assigned to the ship in the last 10 months -- the Navy has disputed the cause of death for one of those sailors -- and eight in total since November 2019. It also follows an April 22 visit to the ship by the Navy's top enlisted official, Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy Russell Smith, in which the crew was told the service is largely powerless to improve conditions. Smith told a sailor who had asked about living conditions that the Navy ""probably could have done better to manage your expectations coming in here"" before informing the crew that raising concerns should be done ""with reasonable expectations and then understanding what ... what this is like."" ""What you're not doing is sleeping in a foxhole like a Marine might be doing,"" he added. According to the commanding officer, the ship currently has 422 sailors living on board. Since sailors typically do not receive an allowance for housing until the E-5 rank, those living on board a ship while it's in a shipyard tend to be the most junior crew members. Gaut couched the development as the result of his team's focus on improving the crew's quality of life, mental health and morale. The captain noted that sailors will still have to sleep aboard the ship when they stand duty -- a Navy practice in which a portion of the crew remains aboard the ship overnight to be ready to respond to emergencies. Gaut also said sailors will be able to keep living aboard if they so choose. Gaut said that this arrangement will end about four months before the ship leaves the shipyard, before giving the crew a date that delays the delivery of the carrier to 2023. The Navy requested that Military.com not publish the specific date out of concerns about operational security. The delay is at least the third for the ship since it pulled into the shipyard at Newport News. In 2019, the ship was scheduled to be done in 2021, but a year later that had changed to 2022. Danny Hernandez, a spokesman for Newport News Shipbuilding, said that work on this ship ""is nearing completion and our shipbuilding team is laser-focused on redelivering a fully recapitalized carrier to the fleet as early as possible."" The news comes as details about who has died aboard the aircraft carrier and how are slowly coming to light amid mixed messages reported by the crew. Sailors reported to Military.com that Gaut told the crew on April 11 that the ship had had nine suicides in nine months. Another death followed on April 15; Gaut told the crew it also was a suicide. The Navy has yet to confirm or deny that Gaut relayed those numbers to the crew. When Military.com reached out to the Navy last week, Lt. Cmdr. Robert Meyers, a spokesman for Commander Naval Air Force Atlantic, said that the service was aware of only seven deaths -- not necessarily suicides -- aboard the ship in the last 12 months. The Navy did not provide details on who those sailors were and referred Military.com to local law enforcement for cause of death. A later Navy statement said that the three April deaths were ""apparent suicides"" while the other four 2021 deaths were as follows: a suicide in December; a ""health-related death"" in October; an ""undetermined"" death in July; and another ""health-related death"" in May. The Navy also disclosed that there were three additional suicides dating back to November 2019. This effectively brought the official count to seven deaths in 12 months, with four suicides. Again, no names were provided. In speaking with crew members and listening to other recordings of Gaut addressing the ship, Military.com was able to identify some of the other sailors who have died aboard the George Washington in the last nine months. The July death, which the Navy's statement called ""undetermined,"" was ruled by the Virginia Office of the Medical Examiner to be a suicide, according to documents provided via email by the office. Still, when Gaut addressed his crew on Tuesday, he said the ship had experienced three suicides and three additional deaths in nine months -- inconsistent with the Navy's official statements and his prior statement to the crew, according to the sailors who spoke with Military.com. Regardless of the final count, the George Washington has experienced a cluster of suicides unheard of in recent years, though suicide rates have been climbing alarmingly for service members across the services. Rear Adm. John Meier, commander of Naval Air Force Atlantic, said in a statement this week that ""while the Navy is a resilient force, we are not immune from the same challenges that affect the nation that we serve."" ""My staff and I are working daily, and aggressively, to ensure support and resources are available to sailors in the shipyards, at sea, and at home,"" he added.

4/30/2022,"Russian tanks have a design flaw making them susceptible to being decapitated in Ukrainian attacks, CNN reported. Unlike Western tanks, Russian ones carry multiple shells of ammunition in their turrets. The flaw means the Russian tank crews are sitting ducks, experts told CNN. Images of destroyed Russian tanks with their turrets blown off have become common since the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine. Experts say that Russian tanks have a design flaw that makes them vulnerable to being decapitated by Ukrainian attacks, called a ""jack-in-the-box effect,"" CNN reported. The issue lies in the fact that Russian tanks carry their supply of up to 40 shells in their turrets, which means that even an indirect hit can cause the entire ammunition store to explode. ""What we are witnessing with Russian tanks is a design flaw,"" Sam Bendett, an adviser with the Russia Studies Program at CNA, told CNN. ""Any successful hit quickly ignites the ammo causing a massive explosion, and the turret is literally blown off."" One video posted on Twitter appeared to show a Russian tank turret that had landed on the fifth floor of an apartment building in Mariupol after an attack. —🇺🇦 Ukraine Weapons Tracker (@UAWeapons) April 21, 2022 A similar video from Chernihiv showed a turret lodged on the second floor of a house. —Sergio Olmos (@MrOlmos) April 3, 2022 The issue is particularly prevalent in Russian-made T-72 and T-80 tanks because they have autoloading mechanisms that typically store about 20 rounds when fully loaded, Steven Zaloga, an expert on Russian and Soviet armor, told military publication Task & Purpose. He added that the internal volume of Russian tanks is much smaller than Western ones. ""If you get a penetration to the interior of the tank, there's a high probability you're going to hit something,"" Zaloga told the outlet. it is not a new issue– many Russian-made T-72 tanks used by Iraq during the Gulf wars in 1991 and 2003 were similarly decapitated. Nicholas Drummond, a defense industry analyst and former British Army officer, told CNN that Russia hadn't learned the lessons from Iraq, which is why many of its tanks in Ukraine feature similar design flaws. The flaw means the Russian tank crews are sitting ducks, Drummond told the outlet. ""If you don't get out within the first second, you're toast,"" he said. Despite the newer Russian T-80 and T-90 tanks having upgraded armor, they suffered from similar ammunition loading systems problems, making them vulnerable to the same fate. The issue also affects other Russian vehicles deployed in Ukraine, such as the BMD-4 infantry fighting vehicle, operated by a crew of three and can carry another five soldiers. Drummond told CNN that the vehicle was a ""mobile coffin"" that was ""just obliterated"" when hit by a rocket. Open-source intelligence monitoring website Oryx has documented at least 300 Russian tanks destroyed in Ukraine, and over 280 that have been damaged, abandoned, or captured, as of April 29. The site only includes destroyed tanks of which photo or video evidence is available, so the true figure is likely to be much higher. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace on Monday estimated that Russia had lost as many as 580 tanks in Ukraine. The latest statistics, published by the Ukrainian Land Forces, claim 873 Russian tanks have been destroyed, along with 2238 armored vehicles, per reports.
