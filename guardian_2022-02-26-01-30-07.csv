2/26/2022,"British asparagus is landing on supermarket shelves eight weeks earlier than usual after the mild winter weather quickened the arrival of this year’s first spears. The traditional start to the season is 23 April but Waitrose will have homegrown asparagus in its shops from Saturday. It has been grown in polytunnels in Hampshire where the grower reported “unseasonably warm” January temperatures. Asparagus requires a soil temperature of at least 10C to grow. However if the conditions are right it can grow up to 10cm in one day. Sandy Booth, of New Forest Fruit, which is supplying Waitrose, said the mild conditions as well as their use of coir – coconut fibre which warms up more quickly than soil – led to the early harvest. Chris Chinn, the chair of the British Asparagus Growers Association, said this first wave was “very early”. “The traditional asparagus season kicks off on the 23 April, St George’s Day, so it is obviously significantly earlier than that date.” Air mile-laden products from countries such as Peru and Mexico – which are among the world’s biggest exporters of asparagus – have traditionally bolstered supermarket shelves because of the unpredictability of British weather. The location of New Forest Fruit, on the sunny south coast, meant the crops “get a lot of sunshine”, Chinn explained. “They’re using some very early varieties and forcing the crop using using plastic, so it’s a good use of the greenhouse effect you get inside a polytunnel.” “Asparagus is very weather dependent,” he continued. “This particular crop is grown in a protected environment but it will still be a bit variable depending on the sunlight receipts and ambient temperature. It’s been a mild winter without many frosts or snow on the ground.” The climate crisis has led to rising temperatures around the world, with Nasa stating last month that global temperatures were now an average 1.1C (1.9F) above the average of the late 19th century. Chinn, who is a partner at Britain’s largest asparagus growers, Cobrey Farms based in the Wye Valley, Herefordshire, said warmer winters were bringing crops on earlier, but added that better plant breeding and growing plants under cover were also extending the growing season. He pointed out, however, that shoppers would have to wait until April for supply to hit its stride. “You won’t see it everywhere in the shops until mid to late April,” he suggested. “It slightly depends on the weather conditions as we get towards that point in time. If we get warm weather it could be closer to mid-April, if it’s colder weather it’s going to be into May.” Once regarded as a “posh” culinary delicacy, asparagus has become a more mainstream choice for consumers in recent years. This growth in demand has encouraged more farmers to get involved and there are now more than 100 domestic asparagus growers. Lucy Darby-Smith, Waitrose’s vegetable buyer, said shoppers wanted to buy British so it was good news that the British asparagus – which costs £3.50 for a 200g bundle – had arrived earlier than usual. “It’s a clear sign that spring is on its way and we’re certainly looking forward to the warmer weather.”",News/Environment,Mild winter brings British asparagus to shops eight weeks early,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/mild-winter-brings-british-asparagus-to-shops-eight-weeks-early
2/26/2022,"British Airways’ owner has said a return to profit was still on course this year despite war in Ukraine and rising oil prices, with its battered share price nosing upwards on Friday after a week of market turmoil. International Airlines Group said it had more than halved its losses to €3.5bn (£2.9bn) in 2021, having slashed staff and costs during the pandemic, and could still return to the black this year should its operations avoid further fallout from Covid-19. Despite industry optimism for recovery only a week ago, when the global airline body Iata spoke of growing momentum as restrictions eased, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had sent IAG stocks tumbling on Thursday. Aero engine maker Rolls-Royce’s share price dropped even faster this week, down 15% with market sentiment worsened by the resignation of its chief executive, Warren East. BA said, however, that the Russian overflight ban on UK carriers announced on Friday would have only a “minimal” impact on its operations, with growth plans targeted firmly westwards across the Atlantic rather than back towards east Asia, where Covid restrictions have curtailed passenger traffic. The airline is hoping to restore much of its route network that was shredded by coronavirus, including getting flights to North America back to 100% of pre-pandemic capacity. The company, which made a record €7.4bn loss in 2020, said passenger numbers were still only 36% of pre-Covid levels last year. Flights and bookings were still impacted by Omicron in the first months of 2022, and IAG said it would make a “significant” loss in the first quarter, when capacity will be about 65% of pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, it expects to return to profit in the second quarter, driven by an increase in bookings for Easter and summer that will underpin “significantly positive” operating profit and cashflows for 2022. “This assumes no further setbacks related to Covid-19 and government-imposed travel restrictions or material impact from recent geopolitical developments,” the company said. Luis Gallego, IAG’s chief executive, said the company was “monitoring events closely to manage any potential impact”. He said: “We are confident that a strong recovery is under way. We expect a robust summer with IAG returning to around 85% of its 2019 capacity for the full year. Our model enables us to capture revenue and cost synergies while maximising efficiencies, which means we are set up to return to profitability in 2022.” BA’s chief executive, Sean Doyle, played down the impact of Russia’s retaliatory ban on British airlines in its airspace, after the UK ban on the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot. BA flew to the Russian capital, Moscow, three times a week but did not fly to any other destinations in Russia or Ukraine – nor did it use Ukrainian airspace. Doyle said the closure of Russian airspace to BA would have less of an impact than before Covid-19. He said: “All of our services are carrying on with minor routing changes. We’re not flying to Japan and China today, but we would have had at least a daily service to China that would typically fly over Russian airspace.” Routes to Pakistan and India could require as much as 60-90 minutes’ extra flying time, he said, while taking a southerly route to Singapore and Australia would mean only a small additional time in the air. He said the affected regions had already been “on hold” and not part of BA’s plans for 2022. Shares in IAG that fell 6% on Thursday after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amid fears that the conflict could impact the travel and aviation sector, rose by 3.5% on Friday. Rolls-Royce also recovered to the tune of 4%. But IAG’s shares still remain down a fifth over the past year. IAG also said it could ride out the rising oil prices, traditionally a millstone for airlines, after the price of a barrel rose to more than $100 (£75). Steve Gunning, the chief financial officer, said the airline’s fuel price was 60% hedged for the full year and noted: “The last time the oil price touched $100 a barrel the group achieved an operating margin of 14.4%.” Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “There is little question that IAG has taken some formidable steps to ensure survival, but from the company’s own outlook it appears unlikely that a full return to normality will land until 2023, and even then the company will be markedly different from the one which entered the crisis.”",News/Business,BA owner IAG reports €3.5bn loss as it monitors Ukraine developments,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/ba-owner-iag-reports-loss-as-it-monitors-ukraine-developments

2/26/2022,"More Republicans have a negative view of Joe Biden than of Vladimir Putin and more Democrats have a negative view of Donald Trump than of the Russian leader, according to a new poll. The findings point to deep domestic divisions as well as disagreement over Biden’s handling of the Ukraine crisis. Fox News released the poll, which it said was carried out before Russia invaded Ukraine. It said 92% of Republicans had a negative view of Biden while 81% had a negative view of Putin. Among Democrats, 87% had a negative view of Trump and 85% a negative view of Putin. Biden has condemned the Russian invasion and introduced tough economic sanctions, in concert with other world powers. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and criticised Biden, on Thursday adapting a favorite golfing metaphor to claim the Russian leader was playing his counterpart “like a drum”. Trump’s attacks are in line with those from Republicans in Congress, who claim Biden has been too weak on Russia, both as president and as vice-president under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2017. In the Fox News poll, 56% said Biden had not been tough enough on Russia, 8% said he had been too tough and 29% said he had been about right. Among Democrats, 42% of respondents said they wanted Biden to be tougher and 47% said his actions were about right. Fox News said Biden’s numbers tracked closely to the same question about Trump when he was in power. In July 2018, 53% said Trump was not tough enough, 5% too tough and 35% about right. That month, Russian election interference in Trump’s favor and his links with Moscow were the subject of an investigation in which the special counsel, Robert Mueller, ultimately said he could not say Trump did not seek to obstruct justice. Also in July 2018, at a summit in Helsinki, Trump and Putin conducted a meeting behind closed doors and with no close aides. What was discussed is not known. Trump was impeached in 2020, for attempting to blackmail Ukraine, withholding military aid while requesting dirt on Biden. At trial in the Senate, only one Republican, Mitt Romney, voted to convict. As the Republican nominee for president in 2012, Romney took a more hawkish position on Russia than Obama. Amid the Ukraine crisis, Republicans have pointed to Romney’s stance on Russia. They have been less keen to mention his vote to convict Trump over Ukraine. The Utah senator also voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial, for inciting the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. The Fox News poll returned closely matched favorability ratings for the 45th and 46th presidents, Trump on 45% and Biden 43%.",News/US news,"More Republicans have negative view of Biden than of Putin, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/republicans-biden-putin-trump-fox-news-poll
2/26/2022,"Afamily of four and a therapist tiptoe around one another in a long, empty room with a two-way mirror at one end. We could be in a hospital or a youth detention centre. Their movement could not feel more agonisingly physical, nor the mirror more exposing. Yet the characters barely move from chairs that are far apart in a space sketched out by designer Naomi Dawson in strip-lighting and scaffolding, which runs through the centre of the audience. The room is in fact a theatrical mirage, constructed by writer Ruby Thomas from the sort of asymmetrical communication that occurs when something really bad has happened and nobody knows who to blame or what to do about it. In a series of gripping group therapy scenes, we find out about the family breakdown that has brought student Sam to this place, but it’s not until the final stretch that anyone puts a name to what he has done. Sam’s father (Jonathan McGuinness) sits in stony silence, while his doula mother (Martina Laird) witters half-baked therapeutic platitudes and his eager-faced younger sister (Ashna Rabheru) is excruciatingly ignored. Everyone – as therapy-speak would put it – is entirely attentive. Evasions that at first seem comic and stereotypical become increasingly damaging and particular, bouncing Ragevan Vasan’s wired Sam between surly and sad, as Paul Keating’s gentle therapist struggles to open up space for self-reflection. The symbolism of the title is lightly touched on with fleeting mentions of bonobos and swifts (Sam is a zoology student). Is this a therapy room or a human zoo, with invisible spectators? It certainly makes you question what theatre is. There’s no plot to speak of, and I was astonished to see a fight director credited: it’s just words. But in Lucy Morrison’s coiled-spring production, it is also so much more. The fizz of the electric lighting as the scenes shift in time; the reconfiguration of the characters between sessions, so that you never see them all face on at the same time; the slow reveal of something you should have worked out but somehow didn’t – that’s pure theatre.

2/26/2022,"“There’s no denying it: it’s a dark day,” said Stephen Colbert on Thursday evening, hours after Russia invaded Ukraine. “Over the last five years we’ve seen democracy repeatedly undermined, tragic unprecedented firestorms, a global pandemic. Well this morning, Vladimir Putin looked at all that and said, ‘hold my vodka.’” In less than a day, Putin’s “special military operation” – an unprovoked attack on its neighbor – left Ukrainian cities in chaos, highways clogged with civilians fleeing west, subway stations turned into bomb shelters. And the Russian leader “had a pretty lame excuse to justify it,” said the Late Show host. In a propaganda-laden speech Thursday morning, Putin claimed the attack was intended to “de-nazify” the Ukrainian government. (A false characterization of Ukraine’s democratically elected leadership.) “De-nazify? That’s hard to do when you’re acting like de-Nazis,” said Colbert. Meanwhile, Donald Trump “has been out there pushing a pro-Putin agenda forever, and he was still out there last night in a speech at Mar-a-Gulago.” On Wednesday evening, Trump addressed a fundraising dinner and praised Putin’s unilateral declaration that two eastern provinces of Ukraine were independent. “Listen, he’s taking over a country, really a vast, vast location,” said Trump, “a great piece of land with a lot of people, and just walking right in.” “Everything is a real estate deal with this guy!” Colbert marveled. “It’s the biggest attack on a European country since World War II! When Hitler invaded Poland, FDR didn’t say ‘well, it would make a good golf course.’” In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel also mocked Trump’s praise of Putin and his ability to make the invasion of Russia about himself. “While bombs were falling on a country that did nothing to provoke an invasion,” Kimmel said, “Trump called into Fox to say ‘never would’ve happened if I was in charge.’” “It takes a special kind of son of a bitch to see innocent people fleeing their homes and think ‘how can I make this about me?’” he added. “But nobody does that better than Donald Trump.” The former president told Fox News that the invasion “all happened because of a rigged election” before proceeding into a typical rambling rant about immigration and inflation. “Can you blame something real on something fake?” Kimmel wondered of the big election lie. “That’s like blaming the chickenpox on the tooth fairy. It doesn’t make sense.” Trump has continued to defend his “KGBFF” Putin, Kimmel continued, “which is embarrassing. He’s never gonna date you, dude. Give it up!” “There’s nothing good you could say about Vladimir Putin,” Kimmel added. “I mean, really, he’s terrible person, but Trump went ahead and did it again last night” with his comments at Mar-a-Lago. “Can you imagine if any other president behaved this way?” Kimmel wondered. “This would be like if during World War II, Hoover came out and said ‘atta boy, Adolf! Sweet mustache, I love what you’re doing there.’” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers also criticized the former US president’s nonchalant response to the crisis in Ukraine. “No one, aside from Putin and his cronies, wants this reckless and illegal war,” Meyers said. “Certainly not the innocent Ukrainians targeted by it, not the rest of the world watching it, and not the hundreds of ordinary Russians who took to the streets to protest despite a total ban on such demonstrations. “So if you were like most people, you were shocked and horrified,” he continued. “But if you were Donald Trump, apparently you were at Mar-a-Lago, watching it with a bunch of Palm Beach plastic surgeons and their third wives and thinking, ‘you really got to hand it to Vladimir Putin.’” As Trump told a dinner crowd at his Florida resort: “He’s taking over a country for two dollars’ worth of sanctions, I’d say that’s pretty smart.” Meyers offered several rebukes. “First of all, stop talking about everything like it’s a fucking real estate deal!” he said. “It’s an illegal war against a sovereign nation, not an empty lot in Atlantic City.” Second, “if you ever find yourself at a fancy high-dollar fundraiser clinking champagne glasses while the keynote speaker applauds a catastrophic war that will cause mass suffering and destabilize an entire continent, maybe take a moment to text your therapist and ask: ‘Am I a bad person?’” Meyers also blasted Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who called Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s plea to Russian people, in Russian, to oppose the invasion a “pathetic display”. “What do you think is more pathetic,” Meyers mused, “trying to stave off a Russian invasion that would cause mass suffering and death by speaking in a second language, or having to explain to a former president live on television that it was Russia and not America who was reportedly launching a secret amphibious assault in Ukraine. “I’d ask these people how they sleep at night,” he concluded, “but I’m guessing they own a My Pillow, which means they don’t sleep at all.”",Arts/Culture,Stephen Colbert on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: ‘It’s a dark day’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/25/stephen-colbert-russia-invasion-ukraine-dark-day
2/26/2022,"The chief executive of top Home Office contractor Mitie has apologised to the home secretary personally after a series of racist WhatsApp messages shared between Mitie staff emerged. The messages, revealed by the Sunday Mirror, include derogatory references to Chinese people. Mitie admitted to the Guardian that it received complaints two years ago about the messages but failed to “escalate them”. The posts come from some Mitie staff who were members of a 120-strong WhatsApp group called “escorts meet and greet” set up in mid-2019. The group has recently been closed down. One remark posted in the group was a comment next to a photo of a Chinese restaurant with a closed sign shortly after the first Covid lockdown in March 2020. A Mitie worker had written underneath the photo: “Closed due to slanty eyed cunts”, a reference to reports that Covid originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Another photo shared on the group showed migrants in a dinghy with the caption “Where Gary Lineker’s house?”, a reference to the Match of the Day star housing a refugee. It is understood that eight members of staff have been suspended after the WhatsApp revelations. An internal email from the chief executive of Mitie, Phil Bentley, circulated to staff after the scandal about the WhatsApp messages broke, seen by the Guardian, states: “I have apologised to the home secretary personally over the weekend and assured her that no stone will be left unturned during this investigation.” He adds in the email that Mitie has let the Home Office down. Alongside his apology to Priti Patel he also apologises to “the vulnerable people being escorted from UK immigration centres” and to Mitie colleagues. Mitie is one of the government’s top 40 strategic suppliers, which between them have secured billions of pounds of contracts. According to analysis by Tussell, which publishes information about government contracts, Mitie has been awarded 400 public sector contracts since 2015, worth £2.55bn. The Home Office previously said its professional standards unit was investigating the racist WhatsApp messages. A Home Office source said there was no further update about the investigation at this stage. It is understood that none of the staff suspended following the WhatsApp disclosures have yet undergone disciplinary hearings but Bentley’s email suggests that dismissal is a foregone conclusion. He asks staff to join him in condemning the people who posted racist messages and says: “They have let me and you down and when they are dismissed they will have let their families down.” A previous email to Mitie staff from Bentley, thought to have been sent in June 2020 after a Big Equality at Mitie summit, states: “It’s evident that we sadly still have colleagues within our business who have been and continue to be subjected to racism and discrimination. This must stop now.” A Mitie spokesperson said: “Our 75,000 hardworking colleagues have worked tirelessly throughout Covid. The behaviour of these few individuals goes against everything we stand for and will absolutely not be tolerated in our business. “We have invested heavily in our diversity and inclusion programmes to ensure that every colleague understands the high standards we expect of them and we encourage them to raise any concerns via our whistleblowing procedures so that we can take appropriate action.”",News/Business,CEO of Home Office contractor apologises for racist messages by staff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/25/ceo-of-home-office-contractor-mitie-apologises-for-racist-tweets-by-staff
2/26/2022,"President Vladimir Putin’s full military escalation in Ukraine has unsettled his seemingly best friend in international affairs, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, who has invested in the bilateral relationship personally and politically. Beijing’s axis with Moscow was recently strengthened during the 2022 Winter Olympics, with their joint declaration to proclaim “their cooperation with no limit”. The western foreign affairs community then rushed to conclude that Moscow and Beijing were forming – if one had not already been formed – a “strategic alliance” aimed at destabilising the liberal, rules-based world order. Some in the west assume Beijing will inevitably support Russia’s military actions in Ukraine. However, cooperation would have to come with some substantial limits to avoid undermining Beijing’s own priorities and interests in the eyes of Chinese foreign policy planners. For various reasons, the Kremlin’s latest military exercise is both a conundrum and a source of equally unexpected opportunities for Beijing. In line with a difficult balancing act, the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, had publicly stated that all countries’ sovereignty and territorial integrity should be protected, including Ukraine’s; and Russia and Ukraine should return to the negotiating table. That is widely regarded as the most clearcut position China has delivered on the current situation and was echoed by a phone call between Xi and Putin today. China’s stance crystallises two elements: first, it does not support the Kremlin’s move against Ukraine, and views Moscow’s actions as a violation of national sovereignty and the UN charter – one of the cardinal principles of Beijing’s foreign policies since 1949. Second, and most important, China strongly implies there is no comparison between Ukraine and Taiwan – the former is a sovereign state and the latter is not a full UN member but a unique polity, seen as a renegade province by Beijing. But China will carefully watch the west’s willingness and resolve to respond to the situation in Ukraine, which may well serve as a reference to Taiwan later. The Kremlin’s military adventurism will also damage China economically to some extent. As Russia’s biggest trade partner, China has significant investments and financial ties with Russia that will be exposed to the west’s sanctions. Such sanctions most certainly come with an acute pain for many fossil fuel-focused state-owned enterprises. Equally, Beijing is Kyiv’s top trade partner, and has enjoyed friendly ties with Ukraine, which is a source of grain and military equipment. Nonetheless, Beijing will measure its reaction to Ukraine through the lens of US-China competition. To this end, the Ukraine crisis provides two unexpected opportunities for President Xi. China views the Ukraine situation as a timely distraction that will draw the US away from the Indo-Pacific region and back to Europe, at least prior to the US midterm elections in November. This offers an unexpected sigh of relief to China as the primary strategic rival to the US. Without deliberate coordination, Beijing and Moscow have already acted as force multipliers to undermine the US’s capability through their individual actions. It is correct to assume that Russia and China see world affairs in a similar light, not least in their antipathy to liberal values. Deepened bilateral cooperation allows the two countries to demonstrate great power status on the world stage, either to counterbalance the dominance of the US or to further their own geopolitical aims. However, Beijing will have to consider the balance sheet for this current alignment carefully. If the cost of alignment comes at a far greater price than the actual benefit, Beijing must reach its own conclusion and tread carefully. Beijing hoped that Russia would offer full diplomatic support to its various global initiatives under a plethora of UN-led platforms, in the context of competition with the US. But Moscow’s current move has made China’s wishes more problematic. Russia’s recklessness serves as a spur for China to rethink its return on its alignment with the Kremlin, and it may wish to minimise the risks associated with Russia’s fraught relations with the west. China may well prepare a discreet course correction to soften its harsh diplomatic rhetoric, and a pathway of less hostile ties with the west to demonstrate its maturity in dealing with a major world crisis. History does serve as a good lesson for the Chinese Communist party: Nikita Khrushchev withdrew all assistance to support China’s nascent industrial development because Beijing refused to become a junior partner of Moscow in political and military terms in the 1950s. The Sino-Soviet split of the 1950s and 60s took place in a very different world, but its spectre remains alive in Beijing and Moscow, and is unlikely to be exorcised in the near future.
