4/1/2022,"A Metropolitan police officer has been charged with grievous bodily harm after a black man was paralysed from the chest down after being shot with a Taser. Jordan Walker-Brown was shot with the electronic device in May 2020 in Haringey, north London, leaving him with serious life changing injuries, including damage to his spinal cord. The decision to for the CPS to bring charges against the officer, who has not been named, follows an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) last year. The IOPC’s inquiry determined that there was an indication that the officer may have committed grievous bodily harm. The police constable will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 19 April. Walker-Brown, 25, was stopped by officers from the Met’s Territorial Support Group on two consecutive days on 3 and 4 May 2020, and on both times was carrying a small amount of cannabis for personal use. On 4 May 2020, Walker-Brown was spotted by a Met TSG officer and was followed. In a statement, he said that he began to run when he saw two more officers get out of a van. He was jumping over a wall, which was approximately 1.2 metres (4ft) high on one side but had a 1.8-metre (6ft) drop on the other, when he was struck by the Taser. He then fell over the wall. In a statement, Walker-Brown said: “I recognise also that the law allowed the police to chase me when I tried to run away from them. But what they were not entitled to do is to use a Taser on me when they knew that I did not pose any threat to them whatsoever: I was running away from them. “I was running away from them precisely because of the threat they posed to me and my safety: a threat that, as a young black man, I could not afford to ignore. I know that I could have easily joined the long line of other black men who have died at the hands of the police.” Commenting on the CPS’s decision to bring charges, Walker-Brown said: “This decision is a welcome first step towards justice for what was done to me by that police officer. I look now to the CPS to ensure that this matter is prosecuted to a just outcome.”",News/UK news,Met police officer charged with GBH after paralysing man,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/met-police-officer-charged-with-gbh-after-paralysing-man
4/1/2022,"A man who alleges he was sexually assaulted by a Tory MP when he was 15 has told a court that he contacted the Conservative press office to tell them what happened. The people he spoke to did not take him “very seriously,” a jury at the trial of Imran Ahmad Khan heard on Thursday. Khan, 48, was elected MP for Wakefield in West Yorkshire in 2019. He denies a single count of sexual assault against the boy. He allegedly forced the 15-year-old to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs and asked him to watch pornography before groping him in a bunk bed following a party in January 2008. Southwark crown court heard that a police report was made but the boy did not want to make a formal complaint at the time. But it all came “flooding back” when he discovered Khan was standing as a candidate in the 2019 election. Days after Khan’s victory in the “red wall” seat, the young man went to police. The alleged victim said he voted Labour but said his complaint was not politically motivated. “If it was, I would’ve done it before the general election,” he said. “I also contacted the Tory press office, trying to inform them what had happened. I wasn’t taken very seriously.” He continued: “I explained that Imran Khan was running for MP … and said: ‘He sexually assaulted me when I was a child, when I was 15’.” The woman he spoke to, the court heard, sounded “shocked” and passed him on to someone else who sounded more “stern” and asked if he had any “proof”. “I said, ‘Yes, there’s a police report,’ and she said, ‘Well...’, and that was it. I said, ‘I’m going to the police,’ and she said, ‘Well, you do that.’” The alleged victim’s parents both broke down in tears as they told how their son was left “inconsolable” and “shaking” after the incident at a house in Staffordshire. The mother said Khan had seemed like a “very charming man” who she believed was “foreign royalty”, while she described her son as an “absolutely joyous boy” who she had tried to bring up in an “Enid Blyton existence”. She said: “He was a young child, he was a boy. He wasn’t a man, and I think that is what has upset me the most about all of this. He was a child when he went upstairs that night and he suddenly had to face what he had to face.” She wept as she added: “I will never, for as long as I live, forget this: [My son] just shaking and shaking and shaking. I couldn’t get any sense out of him. I just grabbed him and tried to calm him and stop him shaking.” The MP claims he only touched the teenager’s elbow when he “became extremely upset” after a conversation about his confused sexuality. Khan’s barrister, Gudrun Young QC, suggested in cross-examination that the complainant has given three “contradictory” accounts – a police report in 2008, and police interviews in 2019 and 2021. She suggested the man, who has trained as an actor, is “literally making this up” and reliving a “drama you are convinced of in your own mind”. But the alleged victim insisted he is telling the truth, telling the court: “I am not a liar.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,"Tories did not take claim of MP’s alleged sexual assault seriously, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/31/tories-imran-ahmad-khan-mp-alleged-sexual-assault
4/1/2022,"The world’s donor drought, and growing global divisions over Afghanistan’s political direction, have been laid bare when a UN appeal for $4.4bn (£3.35bn) to help Afghanistan fell massively short, the second UN donor conference in a month to do so. A UN Yemen pledging conference a month ago raised only $1.3bn against a target of $4.3bn, of which nearly $600m came from the US alone. Some of the longstanding donors in the Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, appear to be holding back, although Qatar is heavily committed to the Afghan process and acted as a co-sponsor of Thursday’s conference. In a sign of a growing global diplomatic split over Afghanistan, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, claimed the donor conference had been hastily assembled at a fortnight’s notice and it was for Nato countries to clear up their mess in the country. “After 20 years of Nato’s military presence and the failed experiment to impose prescriptions and values which were totally alien to the Afghan people, the ‘collective west’ bears direct responsibility for the current humanitarian situation and the deplorable state of the Afghan economy. Therefore, it must assume most of the financial burden for overcoming the crisis and bringing the situation back to normal.” Lavrov also backed diplomatic recognition of the Taliban, so long as the government was made more representative of Afghan’s ethnic mix, but conspicuously did not make a Taliban fulfilment of its pledge to let older girls return to full-time education a precondition of recognition. Speaking at a meeting of foreign ministers from Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries hosted by China, Lavrov questioned why the UN conference was being held on the same day as the neighbours’ conference, accusing the west of using the UN to create divisions. At the UN conference, the UK pledged £286m, the US $200m, Germany €200m and the EU €113m – all amounts that would ensure the appeal was going to fall well short. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, had appealed for generosity at the start of the conference, saying the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan had “deteriorated alarmingly” and urged donors to provide “unconditional and flexible funding” towards its $4.4bn appeal for aid. He said the Afghan economy had effectively collapsed and the country was in a death spiral. The UN says more than 24.4 million people require humanitarian assistance to survive. Food security levels have plunged at a rate not seen elsewhere in such a short period, with half the population facing acute hunger, including 9 million people in emergency food insecurity – the highest number globally. The donor conference was overshadowed by the Taliban’s surprise decision to maintain a ban on older girls’ education, setting back hopes that the Taliban might secure western diplomatic recognition and in turn make it easier for the west to help the country’s long-term development without the threat of sanctions. The World Bank has already put on hold plans to spend $600m to review the impact of the Taliban decision. Annalena Baerbock, the German foreign minister, said: “Afghan girls were eager to get back to their classrooms last week: to return to their books, to resume their education and to see their classmates again. But when they arrived at their schools, they were sent home. It broke my heart to see the images of girls crying in front of their closed schools. “But it also filled my heart with courage to see that many bravely took to the streets to demonstrate for their right to an education. Together with our partners, we urgently call upon the Taliban to grant equal access to education, everywhere in the country. The plight of girls is a dark illustration of the suffering of the Afghan people: the humanitarian crisis Afghans face is among the gravest in the world.” Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, announcing the UK pledge, said: “Our potential to provide support will depend on how constructively the Taliban engage on key issues like the rights of women and girls and also ethnic and religious minorities. “Women and girls are amongst the most marginalised groups. They have been denied opportunities in education and employment – which are key drivers of equality. No nation can succeed if half of its population is held back.”",News/World news,UN donor conference fails to reach target of $4.4bn to help Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/un-donor-conference-fails-to-reach-target-of-44bn-to-help-afghanistan
4/1/2022,"Tesco is selling lateral flow tests in 1,5oo stores, many without pharmacies, as a high street price war sees kits go on sale for less than the price of a takeaway coffee. As universal free testing ended in England on Thursday, the UK’s biggest retailer said the £2 individual tests, from healthcare firm Everything Genetic, would be available in its supermarkets and, from May, across the country on its website. James Price, Everything Genetic’s chief executive, said he believed the partnership with Tesco would bring down the cost of tests and help consumers worried about the extra cost at a time when living costs are soaring. Everything Genetic’s goal was to make testing more accessible and bringing down the cost to “less than a price of a takeaway coffee could help realise those ambitions”, said Price. Tesco shoppers were getting access to “reliable, accurate and affordable” tests, he said. The decision to end free testing, as the government scales back spending on pandemic-related public health measures, has been met with opposition from within the medical profession as well as unions and charities. The Alzheimer’s Society estimates transferring the cost of devices to individuals will cost care home visitors £73 a month which it described it as a “cruel tax on care”. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), has argued that free tests must remain in place, stating: “Introducing charges for Covid tests in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis is both heartless and reckless.” The GMB union has argued the government should continue to provide the tests for free as the public health benefit far outweighed the cost. Rising Covid case numbers meant many people still wanted the “peace of mind” that an accurate lateral flow test devices provide. “As the kits will now be positioned in convenient Tesco retail locations up and down the country, they’ll be readily available at a moment’s notice for anyone wanting to get tested,” said Price. Boots is also selling £2 tests – down from £2.50 last month – in 400 of its high street stores, with the FlowFlex devices also available on its website. A small discount can be had on larger pack sizes, with a box of five costing £9.80. The pricing at rival Superdrug is broadly the same. Lloyds Pharmacy said they would be pricing them at £1.86 each if bought as a pack of five. There are cheaper deals to be found online but would-be purchasers should consult the register of approved devices to make sure the brand is on the list. The pricing of tests is not subject to any government controls but the UK Health Security Agency has promised to monitor the market for any pricing discrepancies. The end of the taxpayer funded service tests is part of the government’s “living with Covid” plan. It has since confirmed the groups that will continue to have access to free tests including hospital patients and to people living or working in “high-risk settings”, such as care homes and prisons. Some free testing will continue during April in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Wales the cut-off is July.",News/World news,Tesco starts selling lateral flow kits as free testing in England ends,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/tesco-starts-selling-lateral-flow-kits-as-free-testing-in-england-ends
4/1/2022,"Ukraine has launched a fresh attempt to rescue civilians from Mariupol after warnings from the Red Cross that thousands of lives depend on the successful evacuation of people trapped in the besieged city by Russian forces. A total of 45 buses were en route to the nearby southern coastal town of Berdyansk, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, as well as a team delivering humanitarian aid and assisting evacuations from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The convoy was expected to enter the city on Friday morning after Russian promises of a limited ceasefire along the route from Mariupol to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Repeated efforts at setting up humanitarian corridors to evacuate up to 170,000 people who remain in Mariupol, which has suffered four weeks of bombardment and dwindling supplies, have failed. Ukraine has accused Russian forces of shelling supposed safe routes out of several fighting hotspots, claims that Moscow denies. “Time is running out to help these people. This evacuation is hugely important,” said Alyona Synenko, a spokesperson for the ICRC. “It is essential we get concrete and precise agreements from both sides on times and routes tomorrow. These instructions need to be conveyed to military units on the ground and they must be respected. “We distributed the last of the supplies we had there two weeks ago. People have nothing now. We are ready to help and we are hoping tomorrow safe passage materialises.” Control of Mariupol, a strategic port once home to 400,000 people and still under the Ukrainian government’s control in the breakaway Donbas region, would ensure Russian dominance in the inland Sea of Azov. Together with other territories seized recently by Russia, it would create a land corridor from the Russian mainland to Crimea. As such, it has been a major focus of Moscow’s five-week offensive and civilians there have suffered gravely. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday that at least 5,000 people had died in the assault on the city. Water, food and medicine are running low, while many families have been unable to bury loved ones killed in airstrikes and shelling because of the ferocity of the Russian attack. A maternity hospital, arts centre housing displaced people and a Red Cross warehouse have all been struck, while residents who have managed to find fuel and undamaged cars have taken their lives into their own hands to flee. A successful evacuation on Friday morning would greatly improve the chance of progress in peace talks, which are also planned to resume online tomorrow. By the same token, if the humanitarian corridor was again attacked, the prospect of any major breakthrough would diminish. Ukraine and its western allies remain sceptical of Moscow’s overtures, which appear to include troop withdrawals from some areas of the country to focus on “liberating” the breakaway eastern region. On Thursday, Ukraine’s state nuclear company said most of the Russian forces that had occupied the Chernobyl nuclear power station since soon after the 24 February invasion had set off towards the Belarus border, with only a small number remaining. Russian forces have also withdrawn from the nearby town of Slavutych, where workers at Chernobyl live. But despite the claims of a wider drawdown earlier this week, Russian forces have continued to bombard the northern city of Chernihiv, while the area’s governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russian troops were on the move but may not be withdrawing. “The enemy is taking losses. It is moving on the territory of Chernihiv region. Can we call that a withdrawal of troops? I am not sure. At the minimum, it is regrouping, but it is possible that it is withdrawing. We must not let down our guard,” he wrote on messaging app Telegram. Ukrainian officials said there were artillery barrages in and around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv over the past day, and heavy fighting has continued in several suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, where Ukrainian forces have counterattacked. Unverified pictures and video which emerged on Thursday on a Kharkiv news channel on Telegram also showed massive damage caused by Russian strikes on a large farm about 30km (18 miles) north-east of the city. Russia’s defence ministry also reported new strikes on Ukrainian fuel stores overnight. An interior ministry adviser, Vadym Denysenko, said a corridor between two eastern towns – Izyum and Volnovakha – was becoming a key battle front. In another sign of Russian intent, the top rebel leader in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, issued an order to set up a rival city government for Mariupol, according to Russian state news agencies. The continued fighting confirms Ukraine’s suspicions that Russia is using talk of de-escalation as cover while readying its forces for a renewed offensive in eastern Ukraine, Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Thousands of Ukranians and Russian soldiers have died and some 4 million Ukranians have fled the country since the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, announced a “special military operation” to disarm and “de-nazify” its neighbour. In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, as well as substandard equipment and poor morale among Russian troops, however, Moscow has struggled to take control of any significant territory. Western intelligence agencies have claimed that Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth about the stalled offensive and the extent of the damage to the country’s economy caused by crippling new international sanctions.",News/World news,Ukraine in fresh effort to evacuate Mariupol after Red Cross warnings,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/ukraine-in-fresh-effort-to-evacuate-mariupol-after-red-cross-warnings
4/1/2022,"About 400,000 children in the UK were lifted out of poverty during the first year of the pandemic because of the government’s £6bn universal credit boost, official figures have revealed, amid warnings benefit cuts could push more than 1 million people below the breadline. Statistics published on Thursday showed years of rising relative poverty were reversed after ministers introduced a temporary extra £20-a-week to universal credit in April 2020, together with extra housing support, furlough and other measures in response to the Covid outbreak. As a result, the incomes of the poorest 20% of households rose by 4% and unemployment stayed low, with campaigners heralding this as proof that investment in social security was an effective way of lifting children out of poverty. There were 3.9 million children in relative poverty – defined as households receiving below 60% of the median annual income – during the first year of the pandemic, the data revealed, equivalent to 27% of all UK children, and down 400,000 year on year. Campaigners and experts said the statistics showed this progress was likely to be a one-off as the withdrawal of the extra £20 a week, coupled with the rising costs of food and energy and below-inflation benefit increases, would take their toll on household living standards from April. Ministers cancelled the £20-a-week boost along with other pandemic support measures in October, arguing – despite widespread opposition – that the government’s focus should shift to getting people into jobs and better paid work as the economy opened up. The UK has since been gradually engulfed in a growing cost of living crisis, with living standards currently falling at the fastest rate since the 1950s. The energy price cap, council tax and national insurance contributions all rise on Friday, piling pressure on already struggling low-income households. The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimated 1.3 million people, including 500,000 children, could be pushed into absolute poverty over the coming months as a result of ministers’ decision to increase benefits and the state pension at less than half the 8% inflation rate – equivalent to an £11bn cut in the value of support. “The lack of targeted support in the recent spring statement means that households’ incomes are set to fall more sharply during the pandemic recovery than they did during the pandemic itself … It is essential that more support is delivered to turn this bleak living standards outlook around,” said the Resolution Foundation principal economist, Adam Corlett. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) said the figures showed ministers had “the power to protect children from poverty” but their failure to offer serious help in the spring statement last week indicated they had “turned their backs” on families struggling with the cost of living crisis. “Many of the children who were lifted out of poverty by the £20 increase to universal credit have already been forced back over the brink by the government’s actions. And as millions struggle with spiralling costs, we know the picture will worsen,” the CPAG chief executive, Alison Garnham, said. Analysis of the figures by the End Child Poverty coalition revealed the highest levels of child poverty at local authority level in 2020-21 were recorded in Middlesbrough, where 42% of children were living below the breadline. At parliamentary constituency level, 51% of all children in Birmingham Hodge Hill were in poverty. Rishi Sunak’s spring statement included a 5p cut in fuel duty and increased the national insurance threshold but it rejected calls for inflation-matching benefit rises and the chancellor was widely criticised for ignoring the households struggling the most with the cost of living. Boris Johnson promised an MPs’ committee on Wednesday he would examine a proposal to increase universal credit in line with inflation, after the Conservative MP Mel Stride warned him that claimants would “really suffer” as a result of the below-inflation benefit rise. The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said in a statement on Thursday the focus would remain on boosting incomes through getting people into work, while a government spokesperson insisted work was “the best and most sustainable route out of poverty”. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said cutting the £20 universal credit uplift had stripped away a vital lifeline. “That choice, combined with soaring energy bills, Tory tax hikes and real-terms cuts to universal credit and the state pension mean hard-pressed families now face the worst fall in living standards ever recorded.”",News/Society,"Universal credit rise lifted 400,000 children out of poverty, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/universal-credit-rise-lifted-400000-children-in-uk-out-of-poverty-show-figures
4/1/2022,"The British government forced through £4.2bn in aid cuts so quickly it had little time to plan the impact they would have, or consult partners, according to an official audit. The National Audit Office (NAO) said bilateral spending – aid given directly to another government – faced some of the harshest cuts by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) – 53% compared with less than a third of the overall aid budget – because of political and legal commitments to multilateral spending. Funding was slashed by 69% to Syria, 62% in Bangladesh and 49% in South Sudan as the FCDO sought to reduce the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of gross national income. Support for Palestinian refugees in Syria was discontinued, despite warnings about the impact on health and education, and funding to the UN population fund was cut. The audit, published on Thursday, said 15 FCDO country and regional offices had their funding cut by more than 50% compared with the previous year. These offices were left to make their own decisions about what to cut, according to criteria such as performance, but, because of previous cuts, even well-performing programmes faced spending reductions. Ministers told offices not to discuss the cuts with their local partners, which the audit said meant staff could not get advice from them. The audit said because the decision to cut aid was made only a month before it was announced in the spending review in November 2020; the FCDO was forced to quickly make immediate changes to programmes that had been planned to run for several years. This meant the FCDO could not carry out a thorough review of the impact the cuts would have, or whether the changes in spending would be good value for money, it concluded. The audit pointed out that 11% of the overall aid budget was diverted to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “The speed and depth of reductions has had an immediate impact locally and the effect on long-term value for money is not yet known. FCDO must build its understanding of how the spending reductions have affected development outcomes to help it plan its approach to future budget allocations, including a planned return to the 0.7% ODA [official development assistance] target.” Bond, a network of UK NGOs, said the audit confirmed its concerns. Abigael Baldoumas, its policy and advocacy manager, said: “We now know just how opaque the process was, how rushed and outsized the cuts to bilateral programmes were, and have more detail about where the cuts fell.” She added the government had to learn from its mistakes.",News/Global development,"UK Foreign Office rushed £4.2bn of aid cuts, official audit finds ",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/31/uk-foreign-office-rushed-42bn-of-aid-cuts-official-audit-finds
4/1/2022,"Had she lived, Kate Stanton-Davies would have just turned 13. She should have been a teenager with her whole life before her, yet as it was she survived for only six short hours. The legacy of that brief time is a harrowing report published this week into the failure of maternity services at the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital trust, where her mother, Rhiannon, gave birth to her. The senior midwife leading the inquiry, Donna Ockenden, said that after talking to some of the hundreds of bereaved families who gave evidence she would sometimes go home and cry. I did too on reading the report, which concludes that no fewer than 201 babies and nine new mothers who died over a period stretching back to the millennium could or would have lived with better care. The stories are haunting. Take the unnamed mother worried about delivering vaginally after a previous caesarean birth, a process that can risk ripping open the old scar, who was pressed into doing so and died on the operating table. Or Kayleigh Griffiths, who had a home birth, and phoned the midwifery service repeatedly overnight with worries about her daughter Pippa’s feeding, breathing and other symptoms; her baby died the next morning of neonatal meningitis, and an inquest later ruled she could have survived with better care. And then there is Rhiannon Davies, whose baby Kate stopped moving in the last weeks of pregnancy – a clear indication of problems – but who was still deemed low risk and sent to a midwife-led unit not equipped to deal with what turned out to be a very sick baby. It’s thanks to Kate’s and Pippa’s parents, who persuaded the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt to open an inquiry, that we now know not only these stories but countless more: babies born brain-damaged who needn’t have been; the survivor of sexual abuse whose baby lived but was so traumatised by her experience on the labour ward that she barely left the house for four years; the woman who suffered a fourth degree tear – and if you don’t know what that is, then trust me you don’t want to – after a junior doctor made a basic error during a forceps delivery, which did not appear even to have been raised with that doctor as a training issue to ensure it didn’t happen again. Since the trust “failed to investigate, failed to learn and failed to improve”, in Ockenden’s words, the same mistakes happened over and over again. And sadly, that’s not unique. Similar stories emerged from a 2015 inquiry into maternity services at Furness general hospital in Morecambe Bay, while new inquiries into maternity services in Nottingham and East Kent are currently under way. Why, in an era of miraculous medical advances, are we still so bad at ensuring women can give birth safely, easily and without going home traumatised? For nowhere else in hospitals are people expected to be proud of their “natural” ability to endure pain without relief. Only childbirth still involves endless guilt for mothers about doing it “right”, combined with techniques of almost medieval barbarism; dragging stuck babies out by their heads with forceps, and patching up their mothers’ ripped flesh afterwards with a shrug. (I’m sorry if this is gory to read, but it’s much more gory to go through.) It’s estimated up to 28,000 women a year in the UK emerge from childbirth suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition more often associated with soldiers at war or survivors of violent crime. If patients were emerging in this state from any other routine procedure we’d be demanding to know what had gone wrong, and surely many of these traumatising experiences must involve near-misses from which life-saving lessons could be learned. Yet women are expected to accept that staggering out of the labour ward feeling as if you’ve been in a car crash is somehow normal; after all, doesn’t half your National Childbirth Trust group feel the same? There is intense pressure not to complain publicly for all sorts of reasons, ranging from embarrassment about discussing the grisly state of your innards or reluctance to frighten pregnant friends to the fear of seeming ungrateful merely to have survived. If you got to take home a healthy baby, it can feel selfish to complain. The idea that motherhood means sacrifice, or burying your own feelings, runs deep and on some labour wards seems actively encouraged. One woman whose baby had been whisked off to the neonatal unit for treatment told the Ockenden review she had been scolded for complaining of postpartum pain; midwives apparently told her that “women who have babies next to them have more important things to think about. People like you, who do not, are only concerned with themselves.” Another was called “a princess” for asking for formula feed for the baby. Wanting a caesarean, a perfectly rational response to a previous traumatic delivery or even to fear of what may happen on understaffed and overstretched wards, is still widely mocked as being “too posh to push”, a misogynistic moral judgment that would sound ridiculous applied in any other field of medicine. Ideological resistance to C-sections was clearly part of the story in Shrewsbury and Telford, where the trust prided itself on a startlingly low caesarean rate while seemingly sweeping the consequences under the carpet. Ockenden concluded this approach was harmful for some and welcomed new NHS England advice not to judge hospitals on their caesarean rates, reversing years of pressure for more “natural” births (which also just happen to be cheap). But the report is clear that isn’t the whole story. Similarly, while it backed recent calls for a £350m annual increase in England’s cash-starved maternity budget now, lack of money doesn’t explain avoidable deaths in Shropshire dating back to the 2000s, relative boom years for NHS funding. What stands out from her report is something much harder to change: a culture of overconfidence and resistance to scrutiny inside a service one interviewee dubbed the “Republic of Maternity”, alongside a bullying culture among midwives which left staff afraid of ridicule if they asked for help. Mistakes were inevitably made, and grieving families fobbed off or ignored. What Ockenden is describing is a familiar mixture of arrogance, fear and denial which won’t end until professionals are properly supported in admitting near misses – the lesson of virtually every patient safety report ever commissioned – and women who have endured horrific labours feel encouraged to talk about them. There is no “right” way to give birth, no perfect model that mothers should beat themselves up for not attaining. But there are some tragically very wrong ones, and many of them start with refusing to listen to women.

4/1/2022,"When labour organisers passed a resolution this month calling for Oregon’s $100bn state pension fund to divest from a fund that owns NSO Group, it pointed to ways in which the Israeli company’s intrusive spyware is alleged to have been used in the past to target union members. “It may seem like a cliche, but an injury to one is an injury to all, and we strongly stand behind that,” said Ira Erbs, a part-time professor at Portland Community College and member of the Oregon chapter of the American Federation of Teachers. Erbs is part of a growing movement of union members in Oregon who are seeking greater transparency from Oregon’s Democratic state treasurer, Tobias Read, about how public employee retirement funds are invested. Activists such as Erbs have already pressed Read on the retirement fund’s investments in fossil fuels, and in companies that operate private prisons. Now, they are focused on the Oregon fund’s longstanding indirect investment in NSO, the maker of one of the world’s most sophisticated surveillance technologies. An investigation into NSO by the Pegasus project, an international media consortium led by the French non-profit Forbidden Stories, reported last year that the mobile phone numbers of dozens of Mexican teachers – part of a faction within Mexico’s politically powerful teachers union – had been targeted for possible surveillance in 2016 by the Mexican government, at a time when the union was expressing objections to proposed government reforms. The teachers’ numbers appeared on a leaked list of more than 50,000 numbers that were believed to have been selected by NSO’s government clients around the world for possible surveillance. The presence of an individual’s number on the list does not mean the person was definitely hacked, and NSO has denied that the list is connected to the company’s clients. An examination of dozens of mobile phones that appeared on the list by security researchers at Amnesty International has shown that a large proportion of the mobile phones showed evidence of being targeted or hacked by NSO’s spyware, which is called Pegasus. When successfully deployed against a target, Pegasus can hack into any phone, intercept calls and messages and can turn the phone into a remote listening device by controlling the phone’s recorder. “We want to send a message to our treasurer that this is unacceptable, that we’re not willing to be a party to supporting this kind of behavior,” Erbs said. Oregon pensioners have indirectly been invested in NSO since 2014, when the then Israeli startup was taken over by a fund controlled by Francisco Partners, a US firm that had received tens of millions of dollars in investment from the Oregon retirement fund. Three years later, Oregon invested $233m in Novalpina Capital, a private equity company that in 2019 acquired NSO from Francisco Partners. The Oregon fund has sought to distance itself from NSO. It has repeatedly said in response to questions from the Guardian that the Oregon treasury is a limited partner in private equity partnerships, and therefore does not “control” investment decisions by external managers. It has also said it is “deeply disturbed by reports about developments concerning NSO Group”. But a report by the Guardian earlier this year revealed that a senior official at the pension fund named Michael Langdon signalled his strong support for the takeover of NSO by Novalpina as early as 2018, months before the deal was finalised and announced. The fund appears to have given his tacit approval at a time when security researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto and Amnesty International were already publicly raising alarms about the company and how its hacking software was being used by government clients to facilitate human rights abuses. NSO was placed on a US blacklist last year after the Biden administration said it had evidence that the company had supplied spyware to foreign governments that used the tools to “maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers”. A spokesperson for Read, who is running for governor, issued a statement in December supporting the administration’s decision, saying that the treasurer supported the sanctioning of technology companies that “facilitate human rights violations and the oppression of journalists by selling technology to authoritarian regimes.” A resolution supported both by the Oregon branch of the AFL-CIO, a federation of unions, and AFSCME, which represents thousands of state and local workers in Oregon, has called for the “immediate and complete” divestment of state pension funds from the fund that owns NSO once “suitable alternatives” are identified. NSO was recently downgraded by Moody’s, the credit agency, at eight levels below investment grade, and is at “severe risk” of defaulting on $500m in debt, making it an “unsound investment”, the resolution stated. For Sravya Tadepalli, a board member of Hindus for Human Rights and a member of AFSCME, who first raised the issue of NSO, the resolution that was agreed hits back at a statement Read made previously about controversial investments, how “politics” ought not to interfere with the management of the fund, and protecting retirees’ returns. “What this resolution does is it essentially takes away that argument. Because if all these unions are saying, ‘No, we care about rights abroad and this is meaningful enough for us to support divestment,’ it takes away the ‘politics shouldn’t affect the fund’ line,” Tadepalli said. A spokesperson for the pension fund did not respond to specific questions about the AFL-CIO resolution. NSO did not respond to a request for comment.",News/US news,US unions condemn ‘unacceptable’ pension funds after NSO links revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/31/us-unions-pension-funds-investment-nso-group
4/1/2022,"I read your article (Mothers were shamed and traumatised at Shrewsbury hospital. I was one of them, 30 March) feeling my heart pound and my anxiety levels soar. My son will be 30 in a few weeks. Thanks to his “natural” forceps delivery (which I was patronisingly told I should be proud of), I have had six bladder operations, the first just 10 months after he was born and the others over the subsequent years. None of these operations were “natural”, and the trauma that I have experienced and that I live with day to day, not knowing when the next operation will be needed, is a direct consequence of a misplaced focus on natural childbirth 30 years ago. My son is physically perfect but, like me, has suffered anxiety which may or may not be a consequence of his stressful delivery. My heart goes out to the writer of the article and to anyone who has been denied agency in childbirth, or who has had to live with the negative consequences of a mismanaged “natural” birth for a lifetime as I have, none of which was acknowledged by the hospital. I can assure my consultant at the time that there is nothing natural about incontinence at the age of 30 and having to live with it and the psychological effects ever since.Name and address supplied  I wish to express my dismay at the findings of the Ockenden report on maternity care at the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust (Police examine 600 cases after damning NHS baby deaths report, 30 March). As a former midwife who has worked in several London hospitals, there can be a dogma of “natural birth” at all costs. This is not just a management issue with regard to poor staffing, heavy workloads and bullying by senior staff, but also of the midwifery training in terms of assertiveness or candour. There has been a shift towards American-style nursing, and 12-hour shifts were introduced 20 years ago. This is the main driving force in my decision to leave the profession. It is a demanding role that requires physical stamina as well as emotional resilience. Midwives often don’t get lunch breaks or even toilet breaks. I would frequently be sent for my lunch break at 5pm after starting at 7.45am. This is not sustainable in the 21st century. Midwives are bearing the brunt of poor management.Christine HoseinLondon  While the Ockenden report identified an array of failings at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust, it also unearthed a culture of fear and blame that resulted in failures being repeated. Healthcare staff were even fearful of cooperating with the inquiry. This culture is the reality for many healthcare professionals, and we hope the review will be a catalyst for change. Healthcare workers must work in an environment where they are not afraid to raise incidents and errors. This means no fear of blame or personal recrimination, support from leaders equally committed to an open learning culture, and patients getting the apologies and explanations that they deserve.Dr Rob HendryMedical Protection Society  How shocking that it has taken two decades to expose the full extent of the maternity care scandal.

4/1/2022,"A reply is needed to the letters (23 March) objecting to political parties supporting nuclear power. How can the chairman of the British Energy Efficiency Federation dispute the statement that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”? Has he not realised that, to meet the climate crisis, the necessary replacement of fossil fuels in road transport and home heating requires electric-powered engines and heat pumps, respectively? Safe underground storage of nuclear waste has been developed. This has never been an insoluble problem. By contrast, little money has been spent on other waste products such as heavy metals, industrial chemicals and plastics. In comparison with nuclear waste, the poisonous effects of heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium never decay with time. We need both nuclear power and power from renewables, the long-term storage of which is a real problem. It is sad that the UK government’s abandonment of support for nuclear industry development in the 1990s has led to the import of expensive foreign reactors. Our country needs a revived nuclear industry based on smaller, much cheaper reactors that are faster to build. Opposition to nuclear power has led to much higher emissions of CO2; for the past 40 years, the emissions from France, whose electricity has been mainly nuclear-powered, have been about 30% less per head than those from Germany. The current abandonment of nuclear power in Germany has not made sense because it has led to more burning of coal and a reliance on imported Russian fuels.Dr Charles ClementWantage, Oxfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/1/2022,"Sajid Javid has vowed to “go after” the people responsible for the biggest maternity scandal in the history of the NHS, saying he will “leave no stone unturned” to ensure they are held to account. An independent inquiry led by Donna Ockenden found that 201 babies and nine mothers could have or would have survived if Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust had provided better care. No staff member or health leader in charge was identified in the damning 234-page report published on Wednesday, despite presiding over catastrophic failings. But on Thursday the health secretary said he was “appalled” by the conclusions of the inquiry. He promised to track down the individuals whose failures left hundreds of babies dead or severely injured. Speaking at Barking community hospital, where he was visiting a diagnostics centre, Javid said it was right the government had accepted the report’s recommendations “to make sure this kind of thing never happens again”. “But it is also right – and I’m absolutely determined to do this – that we make sure we go after the people responsible,” he said. “Of course there were systemic failures, we must change systems, but there were also individual failures, and I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account.” The patient safety charity, Action against Medical Accidents, backed Javid’s call for tough action against bosses who had run the trust, saying it “wants the people responsible for scandals like this to be held to account and not be able to take up similar roles elsewhere”. The group, which was a core participant in the Mid Staffordshire care scandal official inquiry, also urged ministers to bring in the regulation of senior NHS managers, to mirror the systems already in place for many health professionals so they can be banned if found guilty of rule-breaking. Peter Walsh, the group’s chief executive, said: “There must also be accountability for senior managers responsible for awful scandals like this. There should be regulation of senior managers similar to arrangements in place for doctors and nurses, so that they can be struck off a register and prevented from taking on similar roles.” Walsh also voiced concern that some of the recommendations from the 2015 inquiry into the Morecambe Bay maternity scandal, as well as Ockenden’s initial findings published last year, had still not been acted on. For example, there has been “little or no progress” in the creation of “senior independent advocates” to support women who have concerns about maternity services. Police are examining 600 cases linked to the Shrewsbury scandal. Wednesday’s report into baby deaths at the trust condemned health staff and leaders for blaming grieving mothers while repeatedly ignoring their own catastrophic blunders for decades. Earlier on Thursday a cabinet minister revealed she was told she would not be having a C-section despite enduring a “very difficult” labour with her first child. Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it made her “feel sick” to know “in too many cases difficult births can end in the most appalling tragedy”. The international trade secretary told Times Radio she was “basically told I wasn’t going to have a caesarean section”. She said the Shrewsbury inquiry, which found several mothers were forced to have natural births when they could have been offered a caesarean, “reminded me that there has been for a long time a culture which says natural birth: good; caesarean: bad”.",News/Society,Sajid Javid vows to ‘go after’ those responsible for NHS maternity scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/31/sajid-javid-vows-to-go-after-those-responsible-for-nhs-maternity-scandal

This pioneering work is important for the reasons you explain; it also speaks to debates on whether the rise of the robots will result in them enslaving us.

4/1/2022,"Ministers may be forced to make significant concessions on a string of flagship government bills to get them through the current session of parliament, it has emerged, amid an increasingly tight legislative logjam. The government has already written to peers saying it will give ground on a key part of its controversial elections bill before it is scrutinised by the House of Lords, in an attempt to get it into law before the Commons is prorogued, expected to happen later this month. The letter, from Cabinet Office minister Lord True, said the government would not pursue a change in the rules over third-party campaigning, one which Labour had warned could severely affect the ability of trade unions to assist the party. Peers could now seek concessions on other contentious elements of the elections bill, including rules requiring photo ID for voters and closer ministerial control of the Electoral Commission. Adding to the time pressure, two other major bills are still being examined by the Lords, and might require amendments if they are to pass in time: the police and crime bill, and the nationalities and borders bill. Peers have already heavily amended both, removing planned powers to clamp down on the right to protest from the police and crime bill, and overturning a series of measures in the borders bill, including the idea of sending asylum seekers who arrive in the UK to overseas camps. Labour’s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said there was a wider issue with the sheer scope and drafting of bills like those on policing and on borders. “When there are that many amendments, maybe it’s time for them to be thinking: ‘Hang on, should we be doing all this?’” she said. “We’ve got two massive bills that are hugely controversial, they weren’t properly sorted out before they started, and the government wonders why it can’t get them through.” While, under convention, the Lords is expected to give way if MPs make it plain they do not back amendments from peers, the sheer lack of remaining time means a miscalculation by ministers could see one or more bills falling. Bills can be carried over to a new session of parliament, but not if they have already been considered by both chambers of parliament, which is the case for these bills. On Thursday the Commons leader announced that three other bills, which are eligible for carry-over, will see this happen: a controversial bill about freedom of speech in universities, an animal welfare bill, and a bill about high speed rail. The state opening of the next session of parliament has been announced for 10 May. While the date for the prorogation of parliament, ending the current session, has yet to be announced, it is expected to happen on 28 April, so MPs can return to their constituencies for local elections on 5 May. This leaves very little time for legislative business to be completed. The Commons goes into Easter recess for a fortnight on Thursday, with the Lords taking a two-week break one week later. The staggered recess times means there could be just one week, starting 25 April, when both houses are sitting before prorogation. According to figures compiled by the Hansard Society parliamentary thinktank, of 26 bills announced at the time of the last Queen’s speech a year ago, only 11 have so far received royal assent, although around 11 more could do so in the coming weeks. The pressure on parliamentary time has been exacerbated by nine extra policy bills being introduced beyond the Queen’s speech, such as the rushed-through economic crime bill, which assisted with imposing sanctions on Russia. On the elections bill, many peers had expressed serious concerns about its constitutional implications and “have a strong negotiating hand”, said Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society. “There are still several legislative stages left and they can send lots of amendments back to the Commons. But they also know they will be wading into treacherous constitutional waters if they effectively block a Queen’s speech bill passed by the elected house.”",News/Politics,Logjam may force concessions on UK policing and borders bills,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/31/concessions-elections-police-crime-borders-bill-uk-government
4/1/2022,"Benjamin Stevenson has a cinephile buddy who seeks out spoilers. Once an ending is good and ruined, he can focus on the film. Stevenson’s new novel was inspired by this back-to-front tactic. “I thought: ‘what if I spoiled the entire book on the first page,” the author explained in a recent interview, “can I build a crime novel out of it?’”. The result is Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone, an exorbitantly hyped whodunnit, where the grand riddle is the body count. “Everyone in my family has killed someone,” it opens. “Some of us, the high achievers, have killed more than once.” The dastardly clan in question is the Cunningham family – a grand collision of tropes. There’s an uptight aunt; a quiet addict; a Rolex-wielding lawyer; an imperious matriarch. Our narrator is the affably gormless one, Ernest (the name is no accident). The family is ferociously loyal – united in notoriety – so when Ernest provides the testimony that convicts his brother Michael of murder, he’s ostracised. Even Ernest’s wife leaves him for his homicidal brother. On the eve of Michael’s release from prison, Ernest is summoned to a reunion in the Snowy Mountains. It’s a chance to bury the hatchet, but knowing his family’s lethal inclinations, the hatchet might be real. When a body is found on the ski-slopes, Michael is immediately suspect, and Ernest appoints himself chalet detective. He is, after all, a self-published writer of how-to guides – “I write books about how to write books” – which is more deductive training than the (predictably hapless) local cop seems to have. “I would either pave my way back into the family with Michael’s absolution,” he explains, “or deliver the final, validating nail in his coffin.” As a snowstorm descends, and the bodies mount, our pseudo-sleuth finds himself living in exactly the kind of tale he writes about: an Aussie underworld version of The Mousetrap. But will real life comply with the “rules” of detective fiction? Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone arrives with glitzy tales of a Hollywood bidding war and a deal with HBO. “THE AUSTRALIAN NOVEL THAT WILL HAVE EVERYONE TALKING IN 2022!” declares Stevenson’s publisher in emphatic all-caps. The novel is “utterly original” we’re told, alongside the list of everything it so purposefully resembles: “Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle meet Knives Out and The Thursday Murder Club”. How dreary it is to be the critic who hates the bright shiny thing. How miserly it feels to heckle a homegrown success story. And yet, how this novel grates. “I woke to a hammering at my door,” Ernest recalls. “Of course I did. You’ve read these kinds of books before.” Five pages later, the phone rings: “The phone rang, startling us. Of course it did. You’ve read these kinds of books before.” And we have read these kind of books before – so doggedly glib, so irksomely quirky (Steve Toltz’s The Fraction of the Whole immediately comes to mind with its high-larrakin shtick). Stevenson conjures a Cluedo-fantasy version of Jindabyne that’s part fusty English manor house (replete with a stuffed carrier pigeon), part Colorado ski lodge (replete with frozen-over lake); alpine Australia in sheer assertion only. “I glossed over the fact that there’s a freaking library with a fireplace in the building (which happens to be where I will solve the damn thing).” Ernest explains. “It’s pretty much a whole How-to-Write-a-Mystery checklist at this point.” It’s all so excruciatingly self-referential. And until Ernest begins playing at Poirot, he’s terminally uncurious. His brother was convicted of killing a dying man, his victim was already gut-shot. It seems never to have occurred to Ernest – let alone an errant Aussie journo – to identify that victim, explain how he came to be mortally wounded in the first place, or trace his quite blatant connection to the man who ultimately snuffed him out. How any kind of trial went ahead without that information beggars belief. So does the revelation that Ernest has patiently held on to a duffel bag containing $267,000 without particularly caring where his murderous brother acquired it, and if anyone else might want it back. The questions that earnest Ernest asks at the ski-lodge feel years too late – an old reckoning held off in favour of a televisual denouement. The running gag of Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone is that Ernest is entirely honest – a rare reliable narrator – but that the truth can hide as much as a lie. And so Stevenson’s novel sets out to bamboozle us despite, and with, full disclosure. No clue is left un-signposted. No moment of cleverness left uncelebrated. No punchline left unpunched. “There is only one plot hole you could drive a truck through” Ernest declares in the opening pages, and then later, as a literal truck careens down a hill, he takes pains to remind us that we were duly warned. He teases that some of the character names might be anagrams, and then, in the final pages, obligingly unscrambles them for us. The most delightful meta murder writers, like Anthony Horowitz and Janice Hallett, beckon their readers in. Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone keeps us at a chatty, ironic distance, teetering on the sharp edge of pantomime. A third of the way through the novel, Ernest pauses the story to give us a recap. He enumerates every piece of evidence and every unanswered question; reintroduces the cast. It’s a wry little passage, full of one-liners (Stevenson is also a standup comic), but it quashes one of the deepest pleasures of murder mysteries: collating and sorting this information for ourselves. For all of Stevenson’s knowledge of the mechanics of whodunnits – for all his performative tricksiness – he loses sights of the genre’s joys. He spoils the fun. Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone by Benjamin Stevenson is published on 29 March in Australia (Penguin, $32.99) and 18 August in the UK (Michael Joseph).",Arts/Books,Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone review – irksomely quirky whodunnit,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/01/everyone-in-my-family-has-killed-someone-by-benjamin-stevenson-review-irksomely-quirky-whodunnit

This challenge was beautifully realised in the first season of Natasha Lyonne, Leslye Headland and Amy Poehler’s cunning comedy starring Lyonne as a bullheaded New Yorker who constantly dies on her birthday, only to constantly wake up in the bathroom at her party. After some investigation she discovers another person (Charlie Barnett) is stuck in the same loop, prompting the obvious questions: what the hell is going on and how do they bust out? The appeal of this sharply written series is inseparable from Lyonne’s spritzy, attitude-filled performance; to say she steals the show is an understatement.

The premise is stretched slightly thin over eight episodes but this is a sly, moreish murder mystery, told in an energetic style that feels zesty despite the macabre subject matter, with a thoroughly appealing lead performance from Cuoco.

I’ll give you too intellectual!” The narrative begins with a fakeout: we assume it will be the story of Sergei (Karl Glusman), a coder promoted by his oracle-like boss (Nick Offerman) into a job working for the coveted devs team. But Sergei is soon killed off, his death a MacGuffin spearheading an investigation into the company. The tone is slow and moody, full of trippy visual creations and an eight-episode arc that affords Garland (who wrote and directed all episodes) the space to venture into some amazing places. Challenging at times, but highly rewarding. Film, US, 1982 – out 22 AprilTodd Phillips’s shockingly good social commentary Joker drew many comparisons to Martin Scorsese’s classic about a comedian with delusions of grandeur. Fed up with constant rejection, Robert De Niro’s protagonist Rupert Pupkin kidnaps Jerry Lewis’s TV talk-show host Jerry Langford. His ransom demand: to be given the opening spot on one of Langford’s shows. The film is wryly unsettling, digging out a space where it is simultaneously funny, sad and shocking. De Niro’s tough-to-categorise performance is one of cinema’s great portrayals of an antisocial soul.

Set in the 1970s, the ABC’s official synopsis for Barons describes the plot as being about how the “search for the perfect wave” will take a group of surfers “from the beach to the boardroom, creating billion-dollar empires”, drawing parallels to the stories of the founders of Billabong and Quiksilver. Directed by Shawn Seet (Storm Boy, The Code, Hungry Ghosts), Barons will join a long lineage of Australian surfing productions – from 1977’s Summer City to 2018’s Breath.

TV, Ukraine, 2015 – out 7 April Strange but true: before he became president of Ukraine – a job for which, in current circumstances, the words “extremely difficult” do not begin to cut it – Volodymyr Zelenskiy played the president of Ukraine in a satirical TV series he created and starred in. Zelenskiy’s character is a high school teacher who, against the odds, runs for president and wins, giving the show, which arrived four years before Zelenskiy really did run for president and win, a thoroughly unusual, metaish appeal.

TV, US, 2022 – out 29 April Fifty years ago Francis Ford Coppola’s gangster classic not only wowed critics but gobbled up big cash at the box office, becoming the second-most successful film of the year in north America. An achievement of that kind for a long, serious, slow drama could never be replicated in today’s superhero-decimated multiplex cinema; instead it would find a home on small screens as “prestige TV”.

4/1/2022,"Six months before Aidan was diagnosed with cancer, we went to see our daughter’s music concert at her high school. She was in one of the choirs and they were performing an arrangement of a song by legendary Melbourne choir leader, Sue Johnson. As we worked our way through the bag of chips we’d bought along in lieu of dinner, the choir sang. A wash of 40 young voices, woven together. That was the moment Aidan decided singing was what he’d been missing. The next week he went with a friend to a rehearsal of the Pagan Angels, one of the many choirs Sue Johnson leads in Melbourne. He came home calm, smiling and a little smug. Apparently, he had a lovely tenor voice, and besides, they needed men. Each Thursday night he headed off to the Abbotsford Convent to sing in tune. Aidan had never been one to join things. He avoided groups of people with names he knew he’d likely forget as soon as they parted. He left the school council meetings and the netball coaching to me. But the choir was different. He felt restored. He became one of those born-again choir members, telling everyone they needed to sing. Initially he even tried with me. But no amount of his private coaching could help my voice over the line. Pagan Angels wasn’t just about the singing for Aidan. It was about being vulnerable, being honest with the people he met. Through the act of trusting each other with song, they spoke of their lives. And he felt safe, changed by the communal act of sharing his voice. And then he was diagnosed with metastatic cancer – just months before his play, The Architect, opened at the Melbourne Theatre Company. The play was inspired by a woman he cleaned for who had a brain tumour. It was about euthanasia, about wanting to be in control of your own end, and it opened just as the voluntary assisted dying laws were introduced in Victoria. The play was his most successful and he wanted to write another. He was scared of what was coming for him. He turned to his Thursday night choir and found his story. One of hope and humour in a small town. A play about the past and the damage of the church, and ultimately about the power of singing. He recognised that his own need to come together and sing with people who started as strangers and slowly became friends would be at the heart of the play. And then he started missing choir because he was in pain or having treatment. I urged him to keep going, knowing how it made him feel. But he was torn. Aidan always processed things alone. He wasn’t like me. He didn’t just spew his feelings out on to the person standing close. He kept them tight, making sense of them first before returning to the world. And choir was somewhere he couldn’t hide. In many ways it was one of the most regular outings for him in a week aside from chemo or visiting the oncologist. The choir members saw him struggle. He was due to sing the lead in the Nick Cave song, Into Your Arms, for a Pagan Angels performance at the Abbotsford Convent. Finally, the kids and I would see him sing. That Saturday, I was setting up a toy stall in the school gym for our son’s primary school fete. The plan was I’d pick up the kids later and we’d watch the concert and then all go out for dinner. I was knee deep in bright coloured plastic when Aidan came and found me. He was pale. Two rounds into chemotherapy and it was knocking him. He was wearing my mum’s old green raincoat which always looked so out-of-place on him with its cheery colour and its mum-shaped style. I stopped sorting jigsaw puzzles to make plans about where to meet. He started crying in the gym and told me not to come. He didn’t want us there. He wouldn’t be able to sing if we watched him. I didn’t understand. I thought we helped when he felt vulnerable and shaky, but he said it was too much. He left and I went back to pricing Barbies. That was the only public performance he did with the Pagan Angels. I have a recording of it. His voice is strong. Sometimes, when I’m trying to find him now in the house, I play it and the layer of 30 voices harmonising helps. He is singing the solo, and each time I hear it, I can imagine him that day without us, trying to make it to the end of the song without crying. I don’t have messages from him where he says my name, because my phone died not long after he did, and took them all with it. But I have him singing. He spent hours talking with Sue at the Pagan Angels about the play. She helped him understand choirs and how they work. Writing kept him focused on something other than medicine and hospital appointments. It gave us an engine to our family that wasn’t just about him being sick. He finished his play, The Heartbreak Choir, and it was programmed for the following year, April 2020. Aidan went to a reading with the cast and came home exhausted. Sitting in a chair for hours with cancer in his spine was painful and hard. We weren’t talking about the play like it would be his last, even though we both knew. Then Covid hit and theatres in Melbourne went dark. The play like so many others had to be cancelled. We were both devastated but hopeful that if it was programmed the following year, he’d be alive to see it. As the cancer spread and lockdowns took hold, Aidan spent his last months bed bound. The play faded from our lives. He died at home in September 2020. Given that Covid has battered the things we look forward to for two years and that we had to cancel the memorial service for Aidan twice, I have been determined not to think about the play. I have chosen to treat it like an unreliable friend who may or may not turn up for dinner. Now rehearsals have started and opening night is just weeks away. The other day, I opened my wardrobe and looked beyond the T-shirts and jeans to find a dress that might fit the occasion. I spied mum’s green raincoat hanging towards the back. A coat that has survived both her death and Aidan’s. Perhaps I will wear that to the opening night. I cannot imagine how it will feel to sit with our children and watch Aidan’s last written words. Words he never saw performed. We will probably laugh and roll our eyes at the familiar phrases, and clutch each other’s hands and for a few hours, pretend that he is still watching it too.",Opinion/Opinion,"Aidan felt safe at choir, changed by the communal act of sharing his voice – then he was diagnosed with cancer",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/01/aidan-felt-safe-at-choir-changed-by-the-communal-act-of-sharing-his-voice-then-he-was-diagnosed-with-cancer
4/1/2022,"Recent rains have driven the Australian white ibis away from our bins and into Sydney’s sodden parklands. Known as the “bin chicken”, “tip turkey”, “sandwich snatcher” or “picnic pirate”, the much-maligned ibis is now congregating in large numbers in parks across Sydney – meeting to forage for food and to find a mate, according to bird expert Dr Gráinne Cleary. “It is the season of food and love,” she said. “We normally see them around bins, but they’ll switch their diets because of the rain and start foraging as they would do in the wetlands.” As the rain falls, earthworms move to the surface and the ibis flock to find the protein in the pasture. Outside Sydney, the rural ibis use their long beaks to forage in and around wetlands, freshwater swamps and mudflats for food. They have diverse diets but prefer freshwater crayfish, crickets frogs and fish. But their urban counterparts supplement their diets with food from the bin – hence their infamous moniker. Cleary said they would be loving the feast the wet weather has brought with it. “The worms are really good food. This is a lot more natural than McDonald’s,” she said. “They’re responding how they would more naturally, it goes to show how adaptable they are.” Cleary said the birds may appear cleaner, as their diet is better and they wash in the rainwater. The wetter Sydney weather would also be inspiring some to “get romantic”, she said. “There’s a lot of food, there’s a bit of shagging going on as well. We’ll see the numbers increase.” It won’t last long though, numbers will naturally decline when Sydney’s warm weather begins, with the bin chicken likely returning to its rubbish diet. “They’re very communal birds so they are coming together now, there are great conversations, they’re enjoying the rain and they’re gathering as they would have done,” she said. “When the rain ends and it dries up, those ibises will go back to foraging on human food.” Dr John Martin, a research scientist based at the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning, has been running an app where Sydney residents can document the location and behaviour of the ibis, so his team can learn how the population is adapting to its urban setting. He said it is not uncommon for them to change their diet. “They do it every time it rains. I often see them in the Domain [in Sydney’s CBD] and I think, they are all white – they look like sheep in a big paddock. They’re foraging for worms and beetle larvae. It’s natural behaviour.” While they enjoy the protein, their diets are actually quite balanced, Martin said. “They’ve adapted and moved to the city and are happily getting a free feed from our leftovers,” he said. “We haven’t seen that it has a negative impact on their health. This is one of the reasons they forage naturally, as well as scavenge for food. “This helps them have a more balanced diet than we expect.”",News/Australia news,‘There’s a bit of shagging going on’: worms and romance draw Sydney’s ibis from bins to soaked parks,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/theres-a-bit-of-shagging-going-on-worms-and-romance-draw-sydneys-ibis-from-bins-to-soaked-parks
4/1/2022,"Anglicare took three years to apologise for failing to report the sexual assault of young woman with a disability to police, a royal commission has heard. After voicing their concerns during an audit last year, Niky* and her family received a written apology from the organisation for the mishandling of the assault, which occurred in 2018. “It was on paper, but it didn’t feel very genuine,” Niky’s mother told the royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability on Thursday. Niky – who lives with a developmental disability – was sexually assaulted by another person with disability at an Anglicare facility, the commission heard. Niky told the hearing that after the assault occurred, she was met with disbelief by some of the workers at the facility. “They were begging to know what happened … it made me feel unsafe,” Niky told the commission “One [worker] tried to tell me it didn’t happen at all.” Niky’s mother told the commission that when she and her husband met with staff at the facility in 2018, they were told to contact authorities as the incident was “a police matter”. Her father later reported the assault to police and the perpetrator was charged with – and later pled guilty to - carnal knowledge of a person with an impairment of the mind, the commission heard. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “There was nothing from anyone who was in charge at the same time or nothing from the overriding organisation,” Niky’s mother told the hearing. An Anglicare staff member broke into tears after telling the commission that the centre failed to provide counselling for Niky and her family, or report the alleged assault to the authorities. They told the hearing that the facility’s response directly contravened the organisation’s procedures, which she said she wasn’t aware of at the time, despite them being written in 2015 and reviewed in 2017. “We acknowledged that what happened to Niky and the impact on her and her family is devastating,” they told the commission. “We didn’t have the policies and processes in place to support Nikki and her family and … I carry that regret.” The hearing also heard there was only one security camera at the facility and it did not capture the assault. They said Anglicare would review its procedures and ensure there was “robust education” for staff and clients. “I have learned that when we do have something happen, we will go and review the policy or the procedure,” they told the commission. “I just want to offer my sincerest apologies to Niky and her family for not engaging and not supporting them as they required.” The royal commission continues. *Name has been changed to protect the individual’s identity In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.

4/1/2022,"Workers on the lowest pay would receive a real pay cut under a proposal to freeze the minimum wage pushed by the cafe and restaurant industry. The Restaurant and Catering Industry Association called for no increase in the minimum wage in its submission to the annual review, arguing take-home pay is already rising due to job shortages, on top of super increases and budget giveaways. Wes Lambert, the association’s chief executive, warned that if the Fair Work Commission ordered bigger pay rises it was “only a matter of time” before cafes charged $7 for a coffee – prices he said were common in other major global cities. The call to freeze pay is likely to provoke outrage from unions, who argue 2.67 million employees who rely on the annual wage review deserve a 5% or $2,000 a year increase to keep up with spiralling inflation. The Australian Industry Group has called for a 2% increase. Last year inflation grew by 3.8%, compared with just 1.7% for wages, and the decline in real wages has continued this year, with inflation growing 1.25 percentage points faster than wages. The restaurant association argued that its members had already shelled out 4.75% more for employee expenses in 2021: 0.5% for increased super in July, 1.75% for the 2020 minimum wage rise delayed to February, and 2.5% for the 2021 rise in November. Lambert said that market wages in hospitality had increased by 3.5% this year alone, “higher than any other industry”. “That is absolutely evident in advertisements for nearly 100,000 open positions in accommodation and food services at rates that are well above the award, with some barista and kitchen hand positions earning nearly six-figures,” he told Guardian Australia. “So certainly the critical workforce shortage and low unemployment is naturally driving up wages.” The submission said the “overwhelming majority” of the association’s members sought “no change to the current minimum wage”. Some 59% of members surveyed wanted any minimum wage increase, if ordered, to be pushed back from July to November or February. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lambert said if the Covid pandemic was considered an “extraordinary” event that resulted in delayed pay rises in 2020 and 2021, the same was true of a year that had seen “Delta, Omicron, floods and critical workforce shortages”. “If we do see minimum wage rises of 5% or more … it is only a matter of time before we experience $7 coffees, which are common in other capital cities around the world with similar property prices, like Tokyo, New York and London.” “The industry’s wage bill is as high as it’s ever been as a percentage of sales: over 40%. The only thing that can move is prices.” The Ai Group chief executive, Innes Willox, said the Fair Work Commission should not “take chances with the fragile recovery … and instead promote further jobs growth”. Willox said the commission should consider “sectors that are struggling and will be severely impacted by an excessive increase”, including accommodation, food services and retail trade.

The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also called for “extreme caution”. The chief executive, Andrew McKellar, said “small businesses are on a knife’s edge – the risk of further Covid-19 outbreaks, the impact of flooding in New South Wales and Queensland, and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, continue to dampen the prospects of recovery”. “Business is operating in a multispeed economy,” he said, warning sectors including tourism, arts and recreation had been “smashed by lockdowns and restrictions”. “It will still take some time for many of these businesses to pay back debt accrued through the pandemic and return to profitability.”",News/Australia news,Hospitality industry calls for pay freeze for Australia’s lowest-paid workers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/hospitality-industry-calls-for-pay-freeze-for-australias-lowest-paid-workers
4/1/2022,"National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) staff reviewed the social media accounts of a disabled woman applying for the scheme and sent a report to a doctor engaged to provide an expert opinion, a tribunal decision reveals. But their “intelligence report”, which included Facebook and LinkedIn posts dating back as far as 2015, was dismissed by a tribunal reviewing her case as “far from sound”. Confirmation of the practice, labelled “outrageous” by one federal senator, comes from a recent judgment in a long-running Administrative Appeals Tribunal’s (AAT) case seen by Guardian Australia. Crucially, the tribunal found the applicant, a woman in her 30s diagnosed with hypermobility spectrum disorder and a number of other conditions, was eligible for the scheme. This overturned the agency’s previous decision. The woman battled the NDIA for support for 21 months in the case, in which the AAT was tasked with reviewing the agency’s decision to knock back her national disability insurance scheme (NDIS) application. In response to a report from the woman’s treating rheumatologist, the NDIA asked a different specialist to assess her and prepare his own report. Several days before the doctor sent over his findings, the agency sent him “additional material for consideration in the preparation of your report”. According to the AAT judgment, the specialist was told “not to forward or share the documents attached”. The rheumatologist called by the NDIA drew upon the “intelligence report” to find the woman did not experience “significant functional impairment” from her chronic pain, the tribunal said. The social media was prepared in October 2020. The report commented on some of the woman’s Facebook and LinkedIn social media posts, the AAT judgment said. Some of the posts on which the report was based, it noted, were from 2015 and 2017. This was despite the fact the woman had said her condition deteriorated significantly in 2018 and she lodged a statement outlining her AAT appeal in 2020. The AAT judgment did not provide much detail about the content of the dossier, but one post raised by the NDIA was a comment she had sent to a supermarket in which she complained the store was out of fruit. The tribunal’s decision noted that if the NDIA were suggesting this post called into question claims she made about her ability to go shopping, it did not do so. The decision said the post was not inconsistent with her prior statement that she did not go shopping alone, noting the post used the word “we”. More broadly, the tribunal found the “intelligence report” prepared by the NDIA was “far from sound on its face”, and it criticised the decision to provide this to the doctor as “regrettable”. The judgment also noted the woman had tendered as evidence other posts to argue the NDIA had “selectively” picked out parts of her social media history. The woman’s doctor diagnosed her with hypermobility spectrum disorder in 2018. Her condition means her joints stretch more than normal, leaving her at risk of injury. She also lives with chronic pain and fibromyalgia. The tribunal heard she often used a walking stick or wheelchair and sometimes experienced “extreme pain”. While in agreement on the woman’s diagnoses, the experts differed in some respects. Her doctor suggested her hypermobility condition would worsen over time. But the specialist witness called by the NDIA told the tribunal that patients did not tend to get more hypermobile as they got older. His report contained “a number of assertions that he saw no evidence to support her self-reports of widespread pain” after examination, the tribunal decision said. The tribunal preferred the evidence of the woman’s own specialist, noting it was the result of several interactions with the woman. It rejected the NDIA’s claim the woman was “not a witness of truth” and accepted her evidence. Guardian Australia has chosen not to name the woman. The social media report provides further insight into the lengths to which the agency is going to fight the growing number of legal appeals brought by people trying to get on to the NDIS or who are unhappy with cuts to their plans. Advocates have criticised the agency for taking a “combative” approach and spending millions of dollars on private law firms to contest cases against vulnerable applicants. The use of social media monitoring and even private investigators to surveil welfare recipients is a longstanding practice in the social security system, but within the NDIS fraud investigators have focused on NDIS providers. Labor’s NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, accused the government of “managing the NDIS through legal actions against participants”. “There is something utterly dysfunctional going on when genuine people with disability are treated like frauds while the real fraudsters pillage the scheme,” he said. The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John said assessments should be based on the evidence of specialists and the person’s own goals and experience, not “cherrypicked social media posts”. He said the NDIA’s conduct was “outrageous”. Guardian Australia asked the NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, if she was comfortable with NDIA staff reviewing the social media of NDIS applicants. A spokesperson said: “Under the NDIS Act, decisions on participant disability-related supports are made independently from the Minister of the day. “This ensures separation in what can be complex decisions based on specialist advice.” An NDIA spokesperson said there was “no internal process where NDIA staff view prospective or current participants’ social media accounts to inform access or planning decisions”. “All decisions are made in accordance with the NDIS Act,” the spokesperson said. “In external AAT review processes, the use of open source information by the Agency is not common practice. “It is a matter for the tribunal to form its own view on the usefulness or value of evidence in AAT matters when performing its obligations under the AAT Act.” Legal Aid NSW, which represented the woman, said it was unable to comment.

4/1/2022,"AQueen made of wool – “the boss for them mob” – raises her right hand in a salute, as a goanna climbs the outside of Australia’s Parliament House. Above the fray of animals meeting to talk, a kangaroo and emu flank a commonwealth coat of arms that has been transformed into a vibrant shield of multi-coloured connections. “This Parliament House is for everyone – white, Aboriginal and any other colour. It belongs to the community,” says the artist Marlene Rubuntja, one of 11 artists from Yarrenyty Arltere art centre in Mparntwe (Alice Springs) who made the “soft sculptures” component in this work, titled Blak Parliament House. These sculptures were created with blankets dyed with pigments sourced from local plants, tea and corroded metal, as well as wool, cotton and feathers. Of Australia’s parliamentarians, she says: “They’re only sitting in the office and talking. Not listening.” Atop Blak Parliament House, which has been unveiled at the 4th National Indigenous Art Triennial at the National Gallery of Australia, the Australian flag has been replaced with another showing a mountain landscape likened to the ancestral creator caterpillar or yeperenye. Seven artists from Tangentyere art centre, also at Mparntwe, have added protest signs placed to the left and right of the sculptures, some of which read: “Safe water for everyone”, “Land rights” and “Our kids belong at home not in jail”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Blak Parliament House celebrates the role of culture in the history of Indigenous activism, and is unveiled 50 years after the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on the lawns of Old Parliament House in Kamberri or Canberra. It is also five years since the release of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which called for a constitutionally enshrined First Nations voice to parliament and a Makarrata commission “to supervise a process of agreement-making between governments and First Nations and truth-telling about our history”. Sixty-year-old Rubuntja comes from a family that likes to talk with meaning. She says her father, the late watercolour painter and Arrernte law man Wenten Rubuntja, “talked because they really wanted things to be better for their people. Not just words, but feelings, too.” Sat beside Rubuntja is the triennial’s curator, Hetti Perkins, whose father was the late Arrernte-Kalkadoon Indigenous rights activist Charles Perkins. “Like your father, my father, we were always protesting,” she tells Rubuntja. Rubuntja puts a wondrous spin on the animals arrayed before us: “This mob here talking, tonight they’re gonna talk because they seen us all sitting in the chair,” she says. “They helping us, that’s what I think.” “Is it like, we’re watching them, but we don’t realise they’re watching us back, too?” Perkins asks. “Yeah, mmm hmm,” Rubuntja confirms. Speaking at the opening of the triennial, titled Ceremony, Perkins told the audience that Canberra is “at the heartland of what is sort of whitefella sacred ground, and our peoples, our family, our country men and women, whose country this is, have been too often overlooked”. Each of the works, by 16 artists and the two aforementioned collectives, has a “performative element or purpose”, and “the idea of ‘active’ is central: works that are active; works that are activist; works that activate”. Across a vast, curved wall, the Kamilaroi artist Penny Evans has placed 280 glazed terracotta and black clay sculptures modelled on pieces of banksia trees. Her work, gudhuwali BURN, anthropomorphises banksia with its “beguiling” human-like forms. Evans found the 2015 bushfire in the Yuraygir national park in Yaegl country in northern New South Wales profoundly affecting. Reflecting on the impact of the climate crisis, she laments Australia’s disregard for Indigenous knowledge in the face of natural disasters, such as selective vegetation clearing and low-temperature burning ahead of bushfires. Evans lives and works in Lismore, on Widjabul Wia-bal country, which is yet again facing floods after the devastating events of last month. She says the town is “like a zombie apocalypse” – although the army, “once they finally arrived”, did a good job cleaning away the rubbish. “I’m lucky compared to a lot of people I know, they’re still there cleaning up,” she says. “The feds are giving $10m to the CSIRO to do another study around flood mitigation and engineering solutions: levies, dams. We do not need any of that. We need to look after country and let country do what it’s going to do: re-establish the creeks. There are creeks cemented over with car parks.” Meanwhile the photo artist Hayley Millar Baker, based in Naarm (Melbourne), has made her first short film. Titled Nyctinasty, a word meaning the opening and closing of plants in response to darkness or temperature changes, the eight-minute black-and-white film explores “that act of survival to close up at night-time to protect yourself”. Nyctinasty resembles a horror film, and plays with “shape-shifting stories within my mob”, the Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung people (Millar Baker also has Indian and Brazilian ancestry). Set in the home or the “safe space” of an Aboriginal woman, Baker is shown in a meditative state, crushing charcoal, when two mysterious sets of hands suddenly appear on her shoulders. Some people will relate to the horror element, but Millar Baker believes women are more likely to relate to the spiritual part of the scenario. “I feel for women, our intuition is a lot quicker,” she says. “Maybe that is through genetics and motherhood.” Millar Baker only recently gained the “courage to speak my own stories”, such as the fact she has inherited a “magic” line in her family. “I can’t heal but I can astral project,” she says. Her first experience of spirits occurred when she was three, and was witnessed by several cousins during a sleepover: a shadow outside flashed into the bedroom, and Millar Baker was pushed from a bunk bed onto the floor. Such unexplained experiences are “easier when it’s nicer things, like ancestors; it’s more annoying when it’s sinister things”. And Nyctinasty is not all sinister: it not only celebrates autonomy, but survival. The 4th National Indigenous Art Triennial: Ceremony is at the National Gallery of Australia until 31 July.

4/1/2022,"Latrell Mitchell is unlikely to view Friday’s clash between the Rabbitohs and Panthers in a re-run of last year’s grand final as a chance to provide any kind of atonement but deep down the emotional fullback will feel an added responsibility to carry South Sydney on his broad shoulders. Mitchell missed last year’s decider after he was suspended for six weeks following a shocking incident when Souths met rivals the Sydney Roosters. Mitchell aggressively hit former teammate Joey Manu high, leaving the mercurial Roosters centre with a facial fracture that ended his season. South Sydney handled Mitchell’s absence well when they made a run to the grand fFinal before going down to the Panthers 14-12. Whether the Rabbitohs would have claimed their 22nd premiership if Mitchell played is or not is a question we will never get an answer to, but there is little doubt that having an $875,000-a-year international at fullback instead of an eight-game rookie would have given the South Sydney cause greater hope. There were few more controversial incidents last season. Mitchell was widely criticised for not only the damage he inflicted on Manu but for being selfish, allowing his impulsiveness and emotion to undercut his team’s title hopes. It was an incident – and an aftermath – that has clearly weighed heavily on Mitchell over the offseason after he was forced to watch the devastating grand final loss from the sidelines. He has sworn off alcohol and worked vigorously on channeling his emotional state. Mitchell is a player driven by gut instinct, and the Manu incident has clearly driven a desire in him to give more, sacrifice more and provide more. A sublime talent since he debuted at just 18, he now seems to have found the desire to be the very best he can be. Mitchell missed the season opener before he put together two quality performances against two big-time opponents, kicking a match-equalling two-point 45m field goal against Melbourne before a sublime showing against the Roosters in a match charged with electricity. It is Friday’s match against Penrith though that Mitchell will have had circled. This is the game he will want to turn in a match-winning performance. Mitchell cannot atone for last season. What is done is done. And there are no premierships on the line in round four. This is an important game against last year’s premiers – and conquerors – on their home patch and one that a big performance and a Souths win will bring some level of inner peace to the fullback. Much like the decider though, few are affording South Sydney any great hope with Penrith boosted by the return of Clive Churchill medal winner Nathan Cleary. The Penrith No 7 has missed the opening three weeks recovering from shoulder surgery but was never going to miss this clash. The Panthers are the only unbeaten team through three weeks but after a blistering opener against Manly have looked a fair way off the pace in their last two wins against the Dragons and a 12-man Knights outfit. Part of that has no doubt been the lack of continuity with the Panthers. Only nine players from last year’s premiership win have been named to play with four players having departed the club and five more injured. The absence of Cleary has been felt so far but so too have injuries to Brian To’o and James Fisher-Harris. To’o is the best player in the NRL in starting a set off while Fisher-Harris is a ferocious front rower who bends the line playing big minutes. Continuity is critical to maintaining success and the Panthers have had very little of it in the opening month of their premiership defence. Cleary has been eased back and Penrith’s pursuit of back-to-back titles really starts now. Even with half of last year’s grand final team unavailable or no longer with the team, Cleary is the glue that any 2022 success will be built on. Mitchell will be looking to leave a mark but Cleary understands the importance of a statement game. Expectations will be sky high at a buzzing Penrith Stadium on Friday night. The Panthers are not only top of the ladder, the defending premiers and title favourites, they have an 18-game winning streak at the ground to protect. Their last loss at Penrith Stadium was a 30-18 loss to Canberra in July, 2019. Narrative is an overused piece of the sporting lexicon but this game truly is laden with compelling narratives, a fascinating tale of redemption and return, the past and the future, insiders and outsiders, success and failure. Last year’s grand final is already inked into history. That result will never be changed. This game though is about Mitchell finding some level of peace and Penrith finding some level of footing to mount their defence. Rugby league truly does not get more compelling than this.",Sport/Sport,Compelling storylines abound as Panthers and Rabbitohs re-run NRL grand final | Nick Tedeschi,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/01/compelling-storylines-abound-as-panthers-and-rabbitohs-re-run-nrl-grand-final
4/1/2022,"Australia motorists may have to wait weeks for the Morrison government’s halving of the fuel excise to be passed on, with one motoring group warning that retailers could use falling global oil prices as a cover to fatten their profit margins. From midnight Wednesday, the government cut the fuel excise by 22.1 cents a litre for six months at a net cost to the budget of $3bn. Petrol prices have been decreasing for the past fortnight in most state capitals, with falls in recent days largely unrelated to the tax cut. Guardian Australia understands that service stations are now selling fuel that was supplied to them with the 44.2 cent a litre excise, and are only obliged to cut the bowser price when they clear those stocks and take on new supplies. Retailers with slower turnover would work through their more expensive fuel first. Unleaded petrol in Sydney was averaging $1.91 a litre on Thursday afternoon, according to Fuel Check. Adelaide had the lowest price at $1.80 a litre, with Hobart the highest at $2.12, and Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth at about $1.90, the Fuelprice Australia website showed. Peter Khoury, a senior spokesperson for NRMA, said petrol prices waxed and waned according to retailers’ discount phases. Global oil prices, which set the broader trend with a couple of weeks delay, have posted “significant” falls in recent weeks. Gas-oil prices, which set diesel prices, peaked on 9 March and have fallen US$40 (AU$53) a barrel since, while Singapore’s Mogas 95 had dropped at least US$20 (AU$27). A stronger Australian dollar compared with the greenback should help nudge local prices lower, Khoury said. “What we don’t want is a situation … where relative falls in oil prices are merely substituted by the cut in the fuel excise,” he said. “We absolutely want to see the falls in all prices passed on in full.” The chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), Gina Cass-Gottlieb, said earlier this week that the market watchdog would monitor to see if service stations did pass on the excise reduction. Cass-Gottlieb said it could “compel refiners, importers, terminal operators, wholesalers and retailers to provide information relating to fuel prices where necessary”. “We expect that fuel retailers will pass on the cut in fuel excise to reduce the price at the bowser as soon as possible, as existing petrol stock levels are used up,” she said. “We will contact petrol retailers to set out our clear expectations that the savings are passed on to consumers and advise them that we will be monitoring their margins. We will also continue to inform consumers of retailer behaviour.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Khoury said the ACCC had used its “name and shame” powers in the past, and that it was important the focus on the sector didn’t decline once political interest subsided. He said motorists needed the vigilance “not just now while everyone’s focusing on the issues but also for the next six months down the track”. Eleanor Colonico, a media manager at RACV, said Melbourne fuel prices had gradually dropped since 16 March, when average prices reached almost $2.19 cents a litre. A week ago they were at more than $2.04 a litre but by Thursday, the city’s lowest price had dipped below $1.78. “Given the recent prices we have seen, RACV is reminding motorists that it’s not uncommon for retailers in the same area to sell fuel at different prices,” Colonico said. She said motorists can quickly check prices online and find a recommendation for what price they should avoid paying above.",News/Australia news,Motorists may wait weeks for lower petrol prices as retailers use up old stock,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/motorists-may-wait-weeks-for-lower-petrol-prices-as-retailers-use-up-old-stock
4/1/2022,"Families earning up to $132,000 will be able to rent homes from the Victorian government as part of a scheme it says will help ease housing affordability concerns in the state. On Friday, the housing minister, Richard Wynne, will announce the affordable housing rental scheme, which will make about 2,400 homes from the government’s $5.3bn “big housing build” available to rent. In metropolitan Melbourne, rents will be set at least 10% below the median market rent of the area – and capped at 30% of the median income in Melbourne. In regional Victoria, creating extra supply is the priority for the scheme. Rents will be set at the median market rental price for that area, as well as limited at 30% of the median income in regional Victoria. Applicants do not need to be eligible for social housing to take part in the scheme, although people on the Victorian Housing Register will be encouraged to apply for relevant properties. To be eligible for the scheme in Melbourne, singles can earn up to $62,860, couples up to $94,300 and families can have a combined income of less than $132,030. In regional Victoria, singles can earn up to $45,820, couples $68,730 and families $96,220 to be eligible. At least 500 homes will be located in regional Victoria, including in Ballarat, Bendigo and greater Geelong. The first homes in Melbourne to become available will be in Ascot Vale, Ashburton and Heidelberg. Jennifer Beveridge, chief executive of Tenants Victoria, said people leaving the inner city during the pandemic for outer suburbs and regions, as well as a wave of evictions after properties have changed hands, have pushed rental prices higher. The median rental in regional Victoria is now $380 – just $20 less than that in Melbourne. “Overall there are less rental properties available, particularly in the country areas. It’s having an impact on affordability as well as availability of rental homes, and people are being displaced across the state,” Beveridge said. “People have lived for many years or decades or even their whole life in one particular town or regional city stretch, struggling on low incomes to find somewhere affordable to live. “We’ve heard all sorts of creative options that people have developed for themselves. At the start of summer maybe living in a tent or a caravan was an OK option but it’s certainly not a solution to the housing crisis.” Beveridge welcomed the scheme, saying new ideas were vital to tackle the issue. “Now is the time to be creative and to explore ways to resolve these issues that aren’t going away anytime soon,” Beveridge said. “However, we are concerned that this is taken out of a pool of properties that are available for social housing – the waiting list for social housing is extraordinarily long. “We’d encourage the government not to take their foot off the pedal in terms of accelerating availability of that type of housing to Victorians as well.” Wynne said the scheme will help sustain and grow affordable housing and ensure more Victorians have the “safety, security and dignity of a home”. “The new Affordable Housing Scheme will offer an important new option to low- and moderate-income earners – including aged care, retail and hospitality workers – who need to find a secure rental,” he said. The government will begin market engagement in the coming weeks to identify rental managers for the properties, with the first renters able to move at the end of this year. Any profits from the scheme will be reinvested into affordable housing. Properties will be advertised through partner agencies and offered using an eligibility check and selection process. Beveridge also called on the federal government to developing a national housing strategy, noting that for many people renting will be their only housing option in the long-term. Earlier this week, prime minister Scott Morrison suggested Australians looking for rent relief should instead ‘buy a house’.",News/Australia news,"Victoria to subsidise rent for 2,400 new homes in attempt to ease housing crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/victoria-to-subsidise-rent-for-2400-new-homes-in-attempt-to-ease-housing-crisis
4/1/2022,"The Sydney Jewish Museum will lead an independent review into whether Lithuanian immigrant and celebrated Wollongong resident worked for the Nazi intelligence apparatus during the second world war and possibly carried out war crimes. Bronius “Bob” Sredersas was a folk hero and former steelworker who has been a well-known figure since he donated his art collection to the Wollongong Art Gallery in 1976. Guardian Australia reported how a four-year investigation by former local councillor Michael Samaras revealed documents that appeared to show Sredersas, who died in 1982, worked with the intelligence service of the Waffen-SS, known as the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Later Sredersas fled to Germany ahead of the advance by the Soviet Union where he applied for German citizenship and attempted to join the SS as a volunteer before he emigrated to Australia after the war. Wollongong lord mayor Gordon Bradbery and the council’s general manager, Greg Doyle, met with representatives from the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies and the Sydney Jewish Museum on Thursday. Wollongong council asked for assistance verifying the claims made about Sredersas’ past and engaged Sydney Jewish Museum historian, Prof Konrad Kweit to carry out the review. Kweit is a Dutch Holocaust survivor who served as the chief historical consultant in the specialist investigations unit that worked within the commonwealth Attorney General’s Department between 1987 and 1994 to investigate Nazi war criminals in Australia. NSW Jewish Board of Deputies CEO Darren Bark said the meeting showed Wollongong council were “taking the issue seriously”. “There is a great opportunity with these circumstances for education and empowering,” he said. “The first involves educating people and making sure this information, as well as the history, not only of the individual but of the Holocaust, is embedded into what happens next, not only the gallery but the community.” “The second point is about empowering the community and the council to take appropriate steps based on the truth and that’s the best thing we can do for the Wollongong community, because they deserve to know the truth.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It is understood the investigation may extend to examining archival documents held in Lithuania and Berlin, as well as records kept by the KGB. Bradbery said the council would bear the cost of the research but would not “put a price on anything at present”. “They’re going to look into it further in terms of verification and making further inquiries as to whether the individual identified in the document is the same as the Bob Sredersas at this end,” Bradbery said. “It depends on how far we need to go. We might be able to make a ruling on it at a higher level of investigation. “It might be, suffice to say, that we can be given data and details that are sufficient for us to change our interpretation based on what’s already widely available.” The council has also made an official report to the Australian federal police. An AFP spokesperson confirmed the agency had received a report from Wollongong city council on 22 March about “donated artwork”. “As this investigation is ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time,” they said. As Sredersas died in 1982 and is believed to have bought the artworks with wages earned by working in the steel industry, it is unclear what action by the AFP is possible under war crimes legislation. Bradbery said that if the claims can be verified and if it is proven Sredersas had been involved in war crimes, the Wollongong Art Gallery would update its displays though he did not believe it would require a “radical rethink” of the exhibits. “History is not always necessarily clear cut,” Bradbery said. “What we understood about Bob Sredersas needs to be verified but if proven correct, we have to present that in a way that is not only respectful to the Jewish community, but in a way which offers opportunities to education our community about these situations.” “It’s about being respectful of Holocaust victims and the dynamic of what happened during the second world war.” According to the Sydney Jewish Museum 27,000 Holocaust survivors migrated to Australia after the second world war.",News/Australia news,Jewish Museum to lead investigation into claim Wollongong identity collaborated with Nazis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/01/jewish-museum-to-lead-investigation-into-claim-wollongong-identity-collaborated-with-nazis
