5/3/2022,"New Zealand’s former deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, has been banned from parliament grounds for two years for visiting anti-vaccine-mandate protesters who occupied the grounds. The weeks-long February protests, modelled on the Canadian truckers’ “freedom convoy”, took over parliament grounds and blocked off a number of surrounding streets. In the first days of the occupation, the speaker issued a trespass notice to all attendees. But efforts by police to disperse the gathering were repeatedly repelled, until it descended into a violent riot, with at least 40 injured, while tents, piles of rubble and a playground were set aflame. Peters, who was deputy prime minister in Jacinda Ardern’s first coalition government, had visited the occupation in its earlier days, saying, “I hope to encourage the protesters to demand that they be heard.” Peters on Tuesday said he had received a two-year trespass notice for that visit, blaming House speaker Trevor Mallard for the decision. “This dictatorial behaviour … should be reserved for third world banana republics,” he said in a statement quoted by Newshub. “What’s more astounding is that the speaker of the House of Representatives in our country could possibly attempt to trespass former members of parliament – of whom some are leaders of political parties planning to run against the sitting government in around eighteen months’ time.” There was a difference between those who visited the precinct and those who took an “active part in the protest”, he added. Peters lost his parliamentary spot after his party failed to win 5% of the vote, but says he intends to run in the next election. He was not the only one to receive a trespass notice. Ex-National party MP Matt King, who also plans to run in the next New Zealand election with the newly formed Democracy NZ party, received a notice in late April. Violation of the notices could result in a fine of up to a $1,000 or up to three months’ imprisonment. In New Zealand, the speaker has responsibility for parliament’s grounds and buildings. Mallard generated headlines for his unusual tactics in trying to evict the protesters from the lawn – including turning on the sprinklers, and blasting Barry Manilow from parliament’s loudspeakers. Often, those tactics appeared to backfire, galvanising rather than discouraging the crowds. Ardern told Stuff the decision rested with Mallard, but she had asked that he discuss the decision with all parties to try to reach consensus. “Ultimately, this does sit with the Speaker, but I think it is useful for parties to be able to hear him out about how he came to the decision and to make a joint decision, as much as they’re able to, about whether or not MPs should ultimately be treated differently than everyone else.” Mallard did not respond to a request for comment.",News/World news,NZ’s former deputy PM banned from parliament for visiting anti-vaccine-mandate protest,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/nzs-former-deputy-pm-banned-from-parliament-for-visiting-anti-vaccine-mandate-protest
5/3/2022,"The AFL has acknowledged it “could have” publicly shared a leaked report detailing what it called “unacceptable experiences” of sexual harassment alleged by female umpires across Australia. Acting chief executive, Kylie Rogers, has written to stakeholders amid the fallout of the now-public report to explain that, despite receiving it in late 2021, the AFL had chosen not to publish it in favour of taking private steps to remedy the problematic culture surrounding women and girls in umpiring. The AFL-commissioned study was carried out by the University of Sydney, who conducted focus groups and interviews involving 27 umpires of diverse ages and ethnicities to better understand the low take-up numbers of women and girls in umpiring despite the exponential rise in their participation in playing the game. The subsequent report – titled Girls and women in Australian football umpiring: understanding registration, participation and retention – included claims that a male colleague had made comments about a female umpire’s breasts and an allegation of unsolicited nude photos and inappropriate touching during games. The AFL received the report, which featured 11 key recommendations, in August 2021 but it was only made public by News Corp on Monday. “While the report was widely distributed across AFL and academic circles and was provided to those umpires who took part, it had not been publicly released as we focused on the recommendations and developing policies and initiatives based on the report’s findings and the AFL accepts that we could have shared the report publicly while that policy development process was under way,” Rogers wrote to the AFL clubs, states, community leagues and umpire associations. On Monday the author of the report, former AFLW field umpire and researcher Victoria Rawlings, told The Age “the AFL has some responsibility” to make girls and women feel safe and welcome as umpires. Rogers, in her letter, encouraged “any of the aggrieved umpires” to report their complaints to the AFL integrity and security team. “I want to make clear on behalf of the AFL that those incidents and those behaviours are wholly unacceptable,” she wrote. She also referenced a new Women and Girls Game Development Action Plan, which is set to go to the AFL Commission for approval and “is about ensuring that we help leagues and clubs from the community level to the talent pathways and through to the elite game and ensure they have the policies, procedures and promotion to encourage more women and girls into football”.",Sport/Sport,AFL accepts it could have made public its report on female umpire abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/afl-accepts-is-could-have-made-public-its-report-on-female-umpire-abuse
5/3/2022,"Six in 10 people think company bosses should be prevented from earning more than 10 times the average paid to employees, according to polling shared exclusively with the Guardian. A poll for the High Pay Centre, a thinktank that campaigns for fairer pay for workers, found that 63% of Britons said chief executives should be paid no more than 10 times the earnings of lower- or mid-ranking employees. The survey of 1,104 UK adults found that only 3% of people thought it was appropriate for chief executives to get paid more than 50 times the company’s average pay. In reality, bosses of the 350 biggest UK-listed companies are paid 53 times more than the median employee, according to separate High Pay Centre research published in December 2020. A total of 43 bosses of FTSE 350 companies received more than 100 times as much as the average employee. Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, said the research revealed “the extent to which the lives of those at the top and those of everybody else have become so far removed from each other”. He added: “That’s probably not a healthy development. “Britain’s biggest employers dedicate a significant amount of their budget to the pay of a small number of top earners. Redirecting some of this money to low- and middle-income workers would be a good way to raise living standards and address the cost of living crisis but it will require policymakers and business leaders to be a bit more open-minded about whether those at the top really need to be paid so much.” Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, the pharmaceutical company that makes the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, was the highest paid FTSE 100 CEO in 2020, receiving £15.5m. The other top earners were Experian’s Brian Cassin, who got £10.3m, CRH’s Albert Manifold, with £10m, Laxman Narasimhan of Reckitt Benckiser, with £9.2m, and Berkeley’s Rob Perrins, who collected £8m in 2020 (the latest full-year figures available). On an hourly basis, the average FTSE 100 chief executive makes more money in four days than the average UK worker earns in the entire year. Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The whole workforce deserves to share in the success of a firm, not just those in the boardroom. But over the years executive pay has raced ahead of other workers – and now it’s at stratospheric levels. “It’s time to set a maximum ratio between the top earner in each firm and other workers. There should be workers on remuneration committees, to ground decisions in the interests of the whole workforce. And incentive schemes should be open to all workers on the same terms, instead of just giving big bonuses to executives.” The High Pay Centre polling also found that many respondents felt policy measures aimed at distributing wealth more evenly would be more likely to raise living standards than those aimed at increasing economic growth. More than half (56%) of respondents said policies to ensure wealth is shared more evenly would be the best way to improve living standards for those in the middle and at the bottom, while 33% said measures that increase economic growth would be best. Gary Smith, the general secretary of the GMB union, which represents 600,000 workers, said: “The very wealthiest raking in a fortune as the average person struggles to make ends meet just isn’t fair. And the British public agrees. “We’re facing a cost of living crisis. Chief executives’ sky-high pay is a kick in the teeth to working people who make the profits that the richest benefit from. “We need decent pay rises for working people – and the GMB is fighting for that in workplaces up and down the country.”",News/Business,"Most Britons back curbs on bosses’ pay, survey finds",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/most-britons-back-curbs-on-bosses-pay-survey-finds
5/3/2022,"Six people are under investigation in Shanghai after an elderly nursing home resident was mistakenly declared dead, put in a body bag and taken by coroners to a waiting van before mortuary workers noticed they were still alive. The incident, which took place on Sunday afternoon, was filmed by onlookers and footage quickly spread online, sparking a furious backlash in the city which has been under a gruelling lockdown for five weeks. It also prompted concerns over the city’s overwhelmed medical system. In the footage, workers wearing protective clothing are seen pulling a bodybag out of the mortuary van on to a trolley. They look inside the bag before realising the person inside is alive. “Alive! Did you see that? Alive!” says one. “Do not cover him again!” says another. One worker goes to speak with people wearing protective suits outside the building, and the elderly patient is wheeled back inside. 上海新长征福利院把还活着的老人装进尸袋，要送去殡仪馆火化，被运尸体的殡仪馆工作人员发现：“活的！”看来这是嫌上海老人死得还不够多，烧死活人不算死于新冠就行。 pic.twitter.com/O6Zn5qV76L The incident was confirmed by the Putuo district government, which said that investigations had begun. The Shanghai Supervisory Commission and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said five officials, including the director of the care home and a doctor, had been stood down and put under investigation. Another local Party official was reprimanded. Shanghai Xinchangzheng Nursing Home has apologised, while the funeral home reportedly praised its employees for noticing the person was still alive, and rewarded them with 5,000 yuan (£600) each. State media said the elderly patient had been transferred to hospital and was receiving treatment. The incident shocked people in China, where a wave of Omicron is challenging the government’s commitment to zero-Covid measures including strict lockdowns and mass testing. It is also testing the resolve and trust of residents. “What if this incident was not captured by the citizens of Shanghai?” said one commenter on a state media report. “Care homes and nursing homes will be the last places for many elderly people, especially some lonely elderly people who have no choice,” said another. “Who would dare send their parents to a care home now? And who would dare to live in a nursing home with peace of mind?” Shanghai authorities had sought to avoid a lockdown but in early April backflipped on their assurances, sending about 25 million people inside. The lockdown has been plagued with issues including food shortages and delivery problems, and prompted protests both online and in people’s homes and streets. Video has also circulated of a man who said he was a worker in Shanghai, walking on to a road to stop a truck and beg for food. “Shanghai people, not one person cares about us. Take care of us! Expose this! Help me expose this! I am a worker. I’m going to starve to death!” he says, according to a translation by the Chuang blog.

However on Monday 58 new cases were detected among the free cohort of residents. Officials did not comment on the new cases, which prompted fear among some residents of more lockdowns or delays in the city reopening. On Sunday residents in Ningbo, south of Shanghai, were told they must obtain a negative test every 48 hours if they want to use public transport or enter public venues. In Beijing, authorities have also avoided implementing mass lockdowns, instead focusing on frequent testing of millions of people in at least a dozen districts and other strict measures. Restaurant dining, entertainment venues, and schools were closed, and travel restrictions imposed to and from the city ahead of the five-day May Day long weekend. Authorities reported 62 new cases on Monday. Overall, China reported 368 confirmed symptomatic cases and 5,647 asymptomatic cases. The vast majority – 274 and 5,395 respectively – were found in Shanghai. There are growing numbers of asymptomatic cases being detected across the country, including dozens in Liaoning, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Xinjiang.

5/3/2022,"Kim Kardashian has appeared on the 2022 Met Gala red carpet wearing a crystal-embellished gown last worn by Marilyn Monroe six decades ago when she serenaded the US president John F Kennedy for his birthday. The Met Gala, known for its high-profile guest list and extravagant ensembles, marks the opening of the annual fashion exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. This year’s exhibition, In America: An Anthology of Fashion, inspired the gala theme of “gilded glamor”. Kardashian’s interpretation of the theme came from “the most American thing you can think of”. “And that’s Marilyn Monroe,” she told Vogue. “For me, the most Marilyn Monroe moment is when she sang Happy Birthday to JFK, it was that look.” Kardashian’s transformation into Monroe for the Met Gala carpet took more than sporting the Bob Mackie dress. “I did want a physical change too,” she told Vogue. As well as bleaching her hair platinum blond, Kardashian said she lost 16 pounds (7kg) in less than a month to fit into the dress. “It was such a challenge,” she said. “It was like a role. I was determined to fit this. I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein.” Acquiring the dress was a challenge, too. The piece sold in 2016 for $US4.8m and holds the record for the most expensive dress sold at auction, as reported by Vogue. Now usually stored in a temperature-controlled vault at Ripley’s Believe It Or Not Museum in Orlando, Florida, the gown was transported to Kardashian’s home in Calabasas, California by private plane and accompanied by guards. She stepped on to the red carpet in the multimillion dollar-gown topped by a white fur shawl. With her newly bleached hair slicked into a bun, she posed beside her partner, Pete Davidson. The comedian wore a black suit and sunglasses. When worn by Monroe in 1962, the dress caused a stir. “Nowadays everyone wears sheer dresses, but back then that was not the case,” Kardashian told Vogue. “In a sense, it’s the original naked dress. That’s why it was so shocking.” The Monroe look joins Kardashian’s lineup of Met Gala ensembles that have captured attention – including her 2019 “wet” Thierry Mugler dress dripping in crystals and last year’s head-to-toe black Balenciaga bodysuit.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Kim Kardashian wears Marilyn Monroe’s JFK dress as Met Gala celebrates gilded age,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/may/03/kim-kardashian-wears-marilyn-monroes-jfk-dress-as-met-gala-celebrates-gilded-age
5/3/2022,"When people talk about dog whistles in politics, they mean ugly messages – usually racist – that only some voters can hear. It’s metaphorically inexact: we can all hear them, but only some of us come when we’re called. All elections emit a different kind of noise, equally audible, even less likely to be put into words. A “what’s this really all about?” noise. In 2019, it was “all politics is futile, circular, boring, childish, and this is your chance to walk away”. Back then, it was the saddest subliminal electioneering I’d ever heard, but of course that was before the 2022 local elections, in which the take-home is: “We’re terrible. They’re terrible. Everybody’s essentially terrible. You’re probably also terrible.” So, sure, Downing Street had parties while people in hospitals died alone; but have you heard about the opposition? They had beer. Pointless to dive in any deeper; try playing that argument out, and saying, “By April 2021, the rules were completely different …” Before you even get to the end of the sentence, you feel besmirched by your own pedantry, lost in a new, faceless terrain, where nobody’s behaviour matters because everybody’s is the same. And, besides, nobody obeyed the rules all the time, because the rules were stupid. This is an unappealing new consensus, that sensible people saw civic duty all along for what it was: a mug’s game. I’ve heard callers on BBC Radio 4’s Any Answers? argue that everyone watches porn at work, and maybe we should all grow up a little bit; commentators insisting that, hey, politics is bad, but wait until you hear about sexual harassment in the world of finance. Which is worse between a Tory MP who’s a convicted sex offender, deferring his resignation until the last possible minute, and a Labour MP about whom someone once made a sexual and sexist insinuation? Trick question! Neither is worse or better, in the world of mad equivalence where everyone is corrupt because, who knows, original sin, maybe? I hold out a hope, though, that this won’t fly in local elections; there’s something about words such as “transport links” and “recycling” that splashes cold water on the face of fevered notions, and makes you think, “Wait a second … I’m not sure I am that bad.” Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The Tories would have you believe we are all as terrible as they are.

5/3/2022,"Ibalk a little at the idea of riding an e-bike for our multi-day trip across the Helgeland archipelago in northern Norway. Bar a brief pause in my 20s, I have ridden a bike most days of my life without electrical assistance. And we’re only set to average 22 miles (35km) a day, albeit carrying a week’s worth of clothing, which I don’t usually do. “You’ll enjoy it more this way,” says Maylinn Storjord at the tourist office, where my friend and I are hiring bikes. “It is flat, but Norwegian flat.” The comparison reminds me of the way surfers in Hawaii scale their waves differently from the rest of us, on account of their huge size. I take her advice but vow not to switch the battery on for at least the first day. I regret this decision almost immediately, as e-bikes are a lot heavier than normal bikes, especially with panniers jam-packed with provisions. Our journey starts in the small port town of Brønnøysund on the mainland. Over seven days we’ll travel by bike and ferry across the archipelago, covering about 140 miles in total. Helgeland, an atmospheric name if ever there was one, is the southern part of northern Norway, just below the Arctic Circle. The people here are outnumbered by the islands: there are more than 12,000 of them, some minuscule, rising just high enough from the sea for a cormorant to perch on, and others larger, with modest settlements of prettily painted wooden houses. And mountains. Everywhere you look there are mountains. The first one we cycle to is Mount Torghatten, about 10 miles away at the southern tip of nearby Torget island, which we reach by riding over a bridge. We park our bikes at the base and, as we stride up the short, steep climb, it occurs to me that another good reason to be riding an e-bike is to save energy for the hiking. Torghatten is stout in stature, a granite dome wider than it is high, with a gaping 160-metre-long hole in its centre, which legend says was formed when the king of Sømnafjellene threw his hat to block a deadly arrow and save a beautiful girl from a troll. Folklore abounds in these parts, a legacy of when fishers would travel north up the coastline with their sons on the way to work in Lofoten and use the dramatic scenery as a story backdrop to distract them during the long trips. We stay in Brønnøysund the next day, which has a picturesque harbour and cosy cafes, including Goma, where I fuel up with a tasty baked aubergine dish. In the afternoon we ride out to Hildurs Urterarium, a farm restaurant with a lush herb garden. The following morning, under bright blue skies, we take the breakfast ferry, or “metro” as locals call it, north to Vega about 16 miles away. The ferry network is fast and efficient so it’s easy to island hop without a car, and a great way to enjoy the fabled landscape. I spot the 858-metre mountain Dønnamannen and can see why people thought it looked like a giant lying down to watch the stars and why the nearby Seven Sisters range of peaks inspired a story about daughters who snuck out when their father fell asleep and were turned into stone. The mountains are useful for orientation in the archipelago if it’s not cloudy. Today is beautiful and clear, though. We stop at a bakery for some vegalefsa, a cinnamon pancake-like power snack traditionally favoured by fishers, then ride to the Vega World Heritage Centre. The island was awarded Unesco status in 2004 on account of its distinctively frugal way of life dating back to pre-history, centred on fishing and the harvesting of down from eider ducks. The museum, an angular modernist building sitting just above the shoreline, documents the symbiotic relationship in which islanders tend tiny houses for the ducks, to protect them from eagles and otters, in return for harvesting the soft down. There is also an exhibition on heroic local women, for while the fairytales may champion men, it’s clear the women who stayed to farm and tend the ducks while the men went on long fishing voyages worked just as hard if not harder than their partners. After a lunch of cod cheek, a local delicacy (tasty if a little chewy), we ride on empty winding roads, passing rolling green fields and remote rocky shorelines to Mount Ravnfloget. There, we climb the 2,000 steps of the Vegatrappa path, which takes you from the beach through a sculpture trail and up to the summit, which has the kind of panoramic views that stir the soul. The steps were finished in 2019 and there is also a new via ferrata and nascent climbing community, which has been helpful in encouraging young people to move back to these islands, which have suffered emigration for decades. We’ve rented a clapboard cabin (£140 a night for up to six people) near the ferry port for the night, and end the day with a gentle kayak along the coastline and weathered-battered docks. The next day we get the express boat north to Herøy, which takes a couple of hours. We tour the island stopping at empty golden sand beaches and hiking up little hills with spongy grass paths that we spot from the road. By now I’m done with not using the e-bike battery; the roads are rarely steep, but they do undulate a lot, so I’m cranking the power up as if it’s morphine and I’ve just had major surgery. We stay at Elfis Sjøstuer (£70 for up to four people), which roughly translates to “sea camp”. The setting is breathtaking, a renovated fishers’ hut, boathouse and camping pods sit next to the water, and views of Dønnamannen fill the sky. Cycling has overtaken fishing as one of the main reasons to visit the region, and Elfis Sjøstuer, like much of the accommodation in Helgeland, has a “Syklist Velkommen” sign. This means they have secure bike parking, late-night food and packed lunch options, plus facilities to dry and wash clothes. We have a dip in the freezing shallows to ease our heavy legs, then relax on the wooden jetty reading in the sunshine. The weather can be brutal here, but during our August trip it’s mild; the best time to visit is May to early September. Like much of the Arctic region, Helgeland is getting warmer in a way that is alarming and disquieting for locals, but perversely could also make it more attractive to summer tourists. The pandemic certainly reminded Norwegians how appealing the region is, though it’s still relatively unknown to international visitors. Rain and mist envelop us during our ride to Dønna, the longest and most hilly section of the trip, which doesn’t stop us cycling but does mean we do it with our heads down and don’t get to enjoy the reassuring presence of mountains in our eyeline. We finish in Sandnessjøen and hand in our bikes at the tourist office weary but happy. Given the accumulated mileage, luggage, undulating profile and the weather at the end, the e-bike decision felt totally the right call. This trip was provided by Visit Norway. Bike hire costs £39 a day for an e-bike or £28 a day for a regular bike.

5/3/2022,"Sam Knight is a prizewinning British New Yorker journalist whose features and profiles fizz with doggedly chased-down detail distilled into compelling narrative, whether he’s writing about Ronnie O’Sullivan, the £8bn-a-year sandwich industry or preparations for the death of the Queen (“Operation London Bridge”). The Premonitions Bureau, his first book, showcases the gifts that make him so endlessly readable. A richly researched feat of compression, it tells a tantalising tale of the unlikely interplay between the press, psychiatry and the paranormal in Britain during the late 1960s. Knight’s central character (so fluently does he tell his outlandish story, it’s hard not to think of it as a novel) is John Barker, a Cambridge-educated psychiatrist whose interest in clairvoyance led him to pitch the Evening Standard late in 1966 with the idea of a “Premonitions Bureau”, by which readers would come forward with portents of catastrophe, such as that year’s deadly landslide at Aberfan. The paper went for it and over the following year received 732 premonitions, 18 of which seemed to be borne out, of which 12 came from two people: Kathleen Lorna Middleton, a privately wealthy ballet teacher, and Alan Hencher, a switchboard operator who had been experiencing premonitions, accompanied by intense headaches, since a car accident. Unknown to each other before Barker’s enterprise, these “human seismometers”, as he came to think of them, seemed to have an unenviable – and, to them, deeply painful – track record of predicting tornadoes, bombings, deaths and crashes; in March 1967, days after Hencher called the Standard to predict a plane crash in which 123 would die, 126 people died when a Swiss airliner on its way from Bangkok to Basel came down in Cyprus. The sense emerges of Barker as a questing intellect who, sincerely keen to enlarge understanding of time and the mind, rationalised his more esoteric experiments as steps towards some kind of ill-defined “early warning system” to prevent transatlantic disaster. It’s implied, too, that the taste of celebrity that came his way may have been more alluring than the attritional grind of his day job at a Shrewsbury psychiatric hospital, a former Victorian asylum originally built to house 60 patients and by Barker’s time treating more than 1,000, mostly there to be quarantined rather than cured. Knight’s account is soberly sympathetic and wholly serious, with any spookiness confined to the outsize black-and-white images dropped randomly into the text without captions; I swore I could hear Delia Derbyshire’s theremin when I turned a page to suddenly find Barker staring back at me from under devilish eyebrows. When it comes to the text itself, though, Knight mostly keeps out of the way, favouring out-and-out storytelling over talking-head commentary. His flair for synthesis and compression keeps the reader riveted, yet ultimately these strengths are also the source of faint niggles; the abrupt, rather too convenient ending supplied by Barker’s death from an aneurysm in 1968 makes it tricky to gauge the overall impact of a book that isn’t a biography, exactly, yet doesn’t propose any kind of thesis to stand it up as intellectual or social history. You finish the book, perhaps aptly, with more questions than answers. Knight suggestively quotes Rudyard Kipling on deja vu – “How, and why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life-film?” – and the frisson supplied by the experiences of its variously troubled seers, so easily rationalised as mere coincidence or hard-wired desire for sense-making, is hard to shake; witness the detail that a schoolboy who died at Aberfan had, the night before, drawn a picture of massed figures in a hillside under the words “the end”. Still more unsettling, though, is Knight’s reminder of just how many people had voiced concerns about the system of storing mining spoil that led to the landslide; after all, it isn’t only irrational foreboding we find easy to dismiss.

5/3/2022,"Good morning. A truly seismic story has broken in the US overnight: the leak of a draft majority opinion which appears to show that the supreme court has privately voted to overturn half a century of protection for abortion rights. The leak, to the Politico website, was immediately the subject of intense textual and legal analysis by US journalists and experts trying to corroborate its authenticity. It would be the worst security breach in the court’s history. But while caution is obviously the right approach on such a momentous story, there was every sign – from the document’s formatting and footnotes to the distinctive tone of conservative author Justice Samuel Alito – that it is legitimate. There was no comment from the supreme court itself. The court could still vote the other way. But if the end of Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling which enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion, does happen, it would be news of generational significance for American women and a huge blow for supporters of reproductive rights around the world. With protesters immediately descending on the supreme court building to voice their fury over the news, today’s newsletter explains what’s at stake, and what happens next. That’s right after the headlines. Asylum | Priti Patel may face a class action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of Ukrainians stuck in a “chaotic” visa backlog as they seek to come to the UK. Only 15% of the 74,700 Ukrainians to apply under the sponsorship route have made it to Britain.

Suisse Secrets | Swiss politicians are to debate the country’s controversial banking secrecy law amid ongoing pressure to scrap rules allowing the prosecution of whistleblowers. The debate follows a leak of data on potentially criminal Credit Suisse clients to a consortium of outlets including the Guardian. Theatre | The curtain will come down on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s West End musical Cinderella less than a year after its opening, causing dismay among some cast members who had no notice of the closure. The show has suffered heavy losses during its lockdown-affected run. What happened? A draft supreme court opinion, apparently by conservative justice Samuel Alito, was leaked to Politico in a story published late Monday night. It appears to show that the court is preparing to rule in favour of Mississippi in a case over whether the state can outlaw nearly all abortions at and after 15 weeks gestation – a direct challenge to the guarantee of abortion rights enshrined in Roe v Wade. The 98-page document, which includes 118 footnotes and a 31-page appendix on historical state abortion laws, was published in full. “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” it says. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.” It says Roe v Wade “must be overruled” and goes on: “It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” What is Roe v Wade? Roe v Wade is the court decision which protects the right to an abortion in the US up to the point a foetus can survive outside the womb, widely regarded as 24 weeks gestation. A full term pregnancy is 39 weeks gestation. The 1973 ruling is among the most controversial in American history and has been subjected to many legal challenges over the year – but survived until now. For more details on the challenge to the law currently under consideration, take a look at Jessica Glenza’s explainer from December. What does the leak tell us about the court’s decision? While the opinion is purportedly a draft, it would have been written following a vote on the question at hand by the court – and indicates that a majority of justices reached the same view as Alito. Politico reported that four other Republican-appointed justices supported the decision, meaning a total of at least five votes on the 9-member court. After such a vote, a justice is assigned the majority opinion and then writes a draft, which is then circulated and subject to edits. It is possible for changes to be made to the opinion, or even for votes to change, before the court’s final ruling, which is expected in the next couple of months. How significant is a leak of a draft supreme court ruling? The Guardian’s Washington correspondent David Smith called the leak “stunning and unprecedented” and said it would be “the worst security breach” in the court’s history. Theories abounded over the likely source of the leak, from a clerk for a liberal justice hoping to raise public pressure on the court before it publishes its decision to a conservative who wants to soften the impact of the decision when it comes – in other words, nobody knows. A tweet from Scotusblog, a respected news and analysis site, said that it was “impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the Court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the Justices and staff. This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable sin.” How did reproductive-rights advocates react to the news? With fury. A BuzzFeed reporter posted a video of about 200 protesters outside the court chanting slogans like “abortion is healthcare” and “my body, my choice”. Another video showed somebody urging attendees: “If you feel like fucking screaming, then just scream”. What about politicians? Democrats said that overturning Roe v Wade would be a catastrophe. They were led by House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, who issued a joint statement saying such a move would be “an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history”. They also immediately sought to make Roe v Wade an issue for crucial upcoming midterm elections: Christie Roberts, Democratic senatorial campaign executive director, said that “At this critical moment, we must protect and expand Democrats’ Senate majority with the power to confirm or reject supreme court justices”. Republicans by turns praised the apparent vote and condemned the leak itself. Now what? It is worth reiterating that it is still possible that votes could change and mean that the apparent draft opinion remains just that – a draft. But if the supreme court does rule along the lines suggested by the leaked document, the consequences will be rapid and hugely consequential. Because the US congress has never enshrined the right to terminate a pregnancy, the overturning of Roe v Wade would mean individual states can immediately make their own decisions over the way forward. Twenty-six of them would be expected to move quickly to do so, with many having “trigger” laws on the books which would automatically come into effect in those circumstances. That means that women in those states would immediately face severe restrictions on their ability to have an abortion, and the US would become one of only four countries to curtail that right in nearly 30 years.

5/3/2022,"Footage of violent racist incidents such as the murder of George Floyd is traumatising black children, according to the author Claudia Rankine, who believes it could be one of the factors contributing to a rise in child suicide among black communities in the US. The poet, playwright, essayist and academic said the frequency and availability of such images has not led to black people being safer and instead is having a negative effect on the mental health of young people. Rankine said there was now a “generation of kids” in the US who were “terrified” and “feel they don’t have options” in a world where they are criminalised “from the moment they are children”. She added: “When you begin to take into account that the suicide rates around black children, especially black boys are going up, you understand they’re being traumatised by the information that’s coming towards them.” A recent piece in the New Yorker cited research that found racial discrimination can exacerbate mental health issues, while having to deal with things such as body scanners at school and violent racist imagery on the internet means that at “younger and younger ages, [black children] begin to question whether life is worth living.” In the US, as in the UK, the pandemic has triggered warnings about the rise in mental health problems among children, which were already an issue before March 2020. One US study from 2018 found the suicide rate among black children, between the ages of five and 12 years old, was twice that of white peers. Rankine’s latest play, The White Card, addresses the use of traumatic imagery directly by exploring the white liberal racism of a family of art collectors and their impact on a black artist during the Trump era. Its European debut is in Newcastle-upon-Tyne at the Northern Stage before it tours the UK, and when it was first published and staged in 2019 it was described as “subtly dramatising the full spectrum of racism from micro-aggression to surveillance to death as spectacle”. Northern Stage’s artistic director, Natalie Ibu, said the play would feel relevant to a UK audience because of the increased interest in anti-racism after the Black Lives Matter protest movement, and news stories such as the Child Q case. Ibu said: “If you’re living in a country in which a teenage black girl can get stripped at school by police and no one batted an eyelid, then we’re a country that needs to have a conversation about race, racism and whiteness.” The White Card was inspired by a conversation Rankine had with an audience member, who asked her the question: “What can I do for you? How can I help you?” during a Q&A session. When Rankine told the man he needed to ask what he could do to change himself he became hostile, which led her to write a play about white liberal biases and “put it in the theatre in actual white bodies so they know I’m talking to them”. Rankine believes culture can play a critical role in reshaping the way people think about race. She said she loved Steve McQueen’s Small Axe series because the five films interrogated the racism that black British people faced in the 60s, 70s and 80s, and showed how it wasn’t that dissimilar to the US. She said: “I think those films are about the ways in which the same issues that black people have to negotiate here in the US have had a long history in Britain. This is what it looks like, in case you didn’t realise it.” Her writing has also been credited with popularising concepts such as “microaggressions” and after the success of her book Citizen: An American Lyric, she received the 2015 National Book Critics Circle award for poetry and a 2016 MacArthur “genius” fellowship. She says that one of the biggest issues in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter movement is to convince white people that they need to address white supremacy personally. “How do you get white people to understand they really believe they’re better than anyone else?” she asks. “It wasn’t something they were born with, it’s something that the culture made them believe.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

5/3/2022,"Should we be celebrating press freedom at all today? Last year a record number of journalists were jailed worldwide. Five out of every six of us live in a country where press freedom has declined over the past five years; some 400 journalists have been killed in the same time frame. Vladimir Putin has crushed the last vestiges of independent journalism inside Russia. And from India to the Philippines to the UK, there’s been a sharp rise in coordinated, misogynist attacks against female journalists. There seem few causes for celebration, then. And yet this year, I’m daring to believe there’ll be some cautious reasons for hope. For a start, there’s the bravery of our many colleagues who keep reporting, even in the most hostile circumstances. In Peru in recent weeks, the legendary Gustavo Gorriti and IDL-Reporteros, an online newspaper based in Lima, have endured break-ins, physical assaults and smear campaigns, but they keep going. Mexico is one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a journalist, but that doesn’t stop the investigative journalism organisation Quinto Elemento and their partners from exposing mass graves, money laundering and much more. When the offices of Canal de Moçambique and Canal Moz in Mozambique were ransacked and set ablaze, the editor-in-chief, Matías Guente, and his team refused to be cowed. “We will not bow to fire,” ran the paper’s headline that week. There’s plenty of courage and determination to celebrate, then – but, also, increasing ingenuity. In the Philippines, Nobel prizewinner Maria Ressa faces up to 100 years in jail on trumped-up charges, yet she and her Rappler colleagues aren’t just continuing to report the news and embarrass corrupt politicians. They’re building new technology for newsrooms, and have assembled a powerful coalition, ranging from the Catholic church to rural newspapers, to call out lies and hold presidential candidates accountable ahead of next week’s crucial election. Their mantra? “In crisis, we innovate.” Meanwhile, Paris-based Forbidden Stories is unveiling the Safe Box Network: a secure digital system where journalists in danger can keep their stories safe. If something happens to the reporter, their work will be published nonetheless – both a handy insurance scheme, and a big disincentive for those tempted to harm journalists in the first place. “Now, killing the journalist won’t kill the story,” as Forbidden Stories’ founder, Laurent Richard, told me recently. Indeed, as the violence, intimidation and censorship have got worse, many journalists and their allies in law, tech, activism, advertising and elsewhere have just got more creative. Networks have sprung up to deploy targeted ads, mirror sites, free VPNs and much more to deliver accurate news about the war inside Russia, despite draconian Kremlin censorship. Journalists forced to flee are teaming up with other news outlets and building new operations across Europe. The war has also, finally, forced politicians to try to curb the abuse of our courts to silence and intimidate journalists. In March, Dominic Raab announced plans aimed at deterring strategic lawsuits against public participation (Slapps), a tool often used by oligarchs against journalists. Britain’s days as the capital of “libel tourism” may also be numbered thanks to similar European Union plans, announced weeks later, which would also refuse to recognise judgments from outside the EU – including London. The US also announced a global defamation defence fund late last year. While not perfect, Europe’s landmark new deals on tech regulation could be a big step forward in curbing the harassment and abuse of journalists online, too, by forcing big tech companies to clean up the disinformation and hate speech that pollute our news environment. We may also see meaningful action on spyware used to target and surveil journalists, after the Pegasus scandal earlier this year. Critically, big tech firms such as Apple have committed action and money to the cause, as have governments on both sides of the Atlantic. The devil will be in the detail, but it is at least movement in the right direction. It shouldn’t have taken Ukraine’s epic human tragedy or scandals such as Pegasus to force action from our leaders. And there have been other, far less desirable consequences of Putin’s war. Facing constricting energy supplies, Boris Johnson duly trotted off to Riyadh to court Saudi crown prince Mohamed bin Salman, ignoring the gruesome murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A month later Johnson was in Delhi, cosying up to the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, without so much as a mention of Rana Ayyub, Fahad Shah, Sajad Gul or the countless other journalists in Kashmir alone who have been arrested and jailed. “Global Britain” should be so much better than this. The situation remains dire. We can fete the bravery of journalists such as Ayyub, who stand tall in the face of relentless attacks from Modi’s ruling BJP. “I am proud of the fact that the government is scared of me and my words because somewhere it is impacting them, my truth is impacting them. I’m glad,” she told the Perugia journalism festival last month. But the ongoing persecution has taken a huge toll on her health and her ability to work. Meanwhile, Novaya Gazeta in Moscow was finally forced to suspend operations in recent weeks and its editor, Nobel prizewinner Dmitry Muratov, was brutally attacked by Putin’s thugs. Yet from journalists devising their own insurance schemes to keep colleagues alive, to lawmakers who are finally feeling pressure to act, there is much to fight for – and win – in the coming weeks and months. As Muratov said of journalism in his Nobel speech just weeks before Russian tanks swept into Ukraine: “Yes, we growl and bite. Yes, we have sharp teeth and strong grip. But we are the prerequisite for progress. We are the antidote against tyranny.” Mary Fitzgerald is director of expression at the Open Society Foundations, and former editor-in-chief of openDemocracy",Opinion/Opinion,"Around the world, journalists are resisting the regimes that would jail and kill them | Mary Fitzgerald",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/03/journalists-regimes-jail-kill-russia-india
5/3/2022,"A leaked initial draft majority opinion suggests the US supreme court is poised to vote to overturn the Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Politico reported on Monday. The supreme court and the White House have declined to comment. A woman’s right to have an abortion through the first trimester of pregnancy was protected nationally in 1973, following the supreme court’s landmark 7-2 ruling. Plaintiff Jane Roe, later identified as Norma McCorvey, was an unmarried pregnant woman who was unable to get an abortion under Texas law, where it was illegal unless to save the life of the mother. Roe’s lawyers said she was unable to travel out of the state to obtain an abortion and argued the law was too vague and infringed on her constitutional rights. “Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us,” supreme court justice Harry Blackmun, a Republican nominated by the president Richard Nixon, wrote in the sweeping majority opinion that detailed attitudes about abortion from the time of the Persian empire. The Texas law infringed on women’s right to privacy, was overly broad and violated the due process clause in the US constitution’s 14th amendment, the decision said. “This right of privacy ... is broad enough to encompass a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. “Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. “In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.” Five Republican-nominated judges were among the majority. The court ruled the state could regulate the procedure during the second trimester and even ban it in most circumstances in the third. “We do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake,” Blackmun wrote. “We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct.” Justices Byron White, a Democratic appointee, and Republican-nominated William Rehnquist, later US chief justice, dissented. The decision provoked a firestorm among social and judicial conservatives, who have long sought to undermine or overturn it.",News/US news,What is Roe v Wade and how does it affect abortion rights in the US?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/what-is-roe-v-wade-and-how-does-it-affect-abortion-rights-in-the-us
5/3/2022,"The Reserve Bank of Australia has lifted its official cash rate for the first time in more than 11 years in its first intervention in a federal election since John Howard lost office in late 2007. The central bank lifted its cash rate target from the record low 0.1% it had hovered at since November 2020, during the depths of the Covid pandemic. It was raised more than expected to 0.35%, and the RBA signalled more rises to come. “The board judged that now was the right time to begin withdrawing some of the extraordinary monetary support that was put in place to help the Australian economy during the pandemic,” the RBA governor Philip Lowe said in a statement. “The economy has proven to be resilient and inflation has picked up more quickly, and to a higher level, than was expected. There is also evidence that wages growth is picking up. “Given this, and the very low level of interest rates, it is appropriate to start the process of normalising monetary conditions.” An increase was widely expected after consumer price inflation spiked in the March quarter, with both headline and underlying inflation climbing to their highest levels in more than two decades. The size of the increase, though, was 10 basis points larger than the 0.15 percentage point rise, a surprise that sent stocks lower and the dollar higher. While most market economists had expected the cash rate increase, the move came despite Lowe’s earlier assurances that he wanted to see inflation figures as well as wages data – not due out until 18 May – before lifting rates. This failure to signal Tuesday’s move could damage the credibility of future comments from Lowe and the RBA, some economists have said. On the flip side, by lifting the cash rate during an election campaign, the RBA has underscored its independence. The nine-member board is chosen by the treasurer and includes treasury secretary Steven Kennedy, an appointment unlike that which occurs in the central banks of similar countries, such as Canada. “The election has no influence at all on today’s decision,” Lowe told a press conference in Sydney. “We don’t take the political situation to account. We do what we think is right for the country.” While the rate rise will hurt borrowers, those with deposits will be cheering after years of little or no return. Tuesday’s hike will be passed on to both lending and deposit rates by commercial banks but the size of the increase and pace of adjustment will no doubt draw scrutiny, particularly as more rises are likely soon. “Inflation has picked up significantly and by more than expected, although it remains lower than in most other advanced economies,” Lowe said. “This rise in inflation largely reflects global factors,” he said. “But domestic capacity constraints are increasingly playing a role and inflation pressures have broadened, with firms more prepared to pass through cost increases to consumer prices.” The verdict will likely stoke the cost-of-living debate during the election campaign, and potentially make it harder for the Morrison government to spruik its economic management credentials. Others, though, will be looking to see what promises Labor under an Anthony Albanese government can deliver to ease inflationary pressures. Lowe made it clear the May rise will be followed by more increases soon. “The board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation in Australia returns to target over time,” he said. “This will require a further lift in interest rates over the period ahead.” But the timing and size of future increases will depend on how the “balance of risks” evolve, Lowe said. David Plank, ANZ’s head of Australian economics, said the 25-basis point increase “ended up surprising everyone”. “The move is at the hawkish end of the spectrum,” Plank said. “This reflects the RBA’s elevated inflation forecasts.” These predictions includes the headline inflation to reach 6% by the end of 2022, with core or underlying inflation at 4.75%. In March, the latter came in at 3.7%. The ANZ said another increase at next month’s board meeting of 40 basis points to 0.75% “seems a distinct possibility”, Plank said.",News/Australia news,Reserve Bank interest rates: RBA lifts official cash rate to 0.35% in first rise since 2010 ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/03/reserve-bank-of-australia-lifts-official-interest-rates-to-035-in-first-rise-since-2010
5/3/2022,"It’s the worst possible outcome: according to a draft majority opinion published by Politico, the US supreme court has voted to overturn Roe v Wade, along with its sister decision Planned Parenthood v Casey. This momentous ruling will result in abortion becoming immediately illegal in an estimated 26 states when it is officially issued, likely sometime next month. The draft opinion, authored by Samuel Alito, the most rabidly hateful member of the court’s archconservative wing, will upend 50 years of precedent and undo a landmark ruling that has profoundly shaped legal doctrine, popular conceptions of the law, and millions of American lives. It will make women prisoners to their own bodies, and to men’s ideas of what those bodies must mean. It will make our country weaker, crueler, stupider and less vibrant. Before the court heard oral arguments in the case Dobbs v Jackson, a challenge to a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks’ gestational age, some court watchers – mostly male – predicted that this outcome was unlikely. They chin-strokingly declared that judicial nominees like Amy Coney Barrett or Neil Gorsuch were really moderates (both have signed on to the draft opinion) or that chief justice John Roberts’ incrementalist impulses would temper the passions of his more misogynist colleagues. Feminists, meanwhile, were more consistent in measuring the depth of the right’s commitment to sexism and more perceptive in understanding the implications for other areas of the law in a world without Roe. But after oral arguments on 1 December, even those pundits who were most committed to their performance of sophisticated calm had to admit that there was little doubt that this would be the outcome. The hearing, whose audio was livestreamed to the public, turned into a carnival of delusional hypotheticals and nodding insistence on the triviality of precedent. Amy Coney Barrett asked why women needed abortion, now that “safe haven” laws allowed for new mothers to surrender newborns without being arrested. Kavanaugh rattled off long lists all the decisions that the court had overturned in the past. It was a joke, a festival of misogyny, an unserious legal formality providing a gossamer of legitimacy for a preordained outcome. Roe would be overturned. In a way, the leaked opinion didn’t tell us anything we did not already know: these are the last days of reproductive freedom in America, and most states will soon ban abortion outright, or restrict it so onerously that it is inaccessible within their borders. But Alito’s draft opinion nevertheless represents about as odiously maximalist an approach as the court could have taken. The opinion does not just overturn Roe and Casey; it expresses outright contempt for the notion that the constitution protects bodily autonomy for women. It articulates a rigid and unchanging vision of individual rights, one in which only those freedoms with robust historical precedent and explicit enumeration in the text of the constitution will be recognized by the court. This an interpretation that, if carried to its logical conclusion, would eradicate many of Americans’ other rights that the court has recognized based on so-called substantive due process concerns, among them the right to contraception, the right to gay marriage, and the decriminalization of gay sex. The end of legal abortion will not be where the court’s reactionaries stop. They aim to hurt, punish, and narrow the lives of Americans in many more cruel and inventive ways. The sudden illegality of abortion in most states come June will also create new legal landmines that will rapidly erode other individual rights. As women cross state borders for care, red states will try to limit interstate travel. As activists send abortion pills through the mail, aggressive searches and seizures of packages and personal belongings will become more frequent. As women find ways to end their pregnancies, many of them will be arrested on criminal charges and some of them will be convicted. As doctors face patients with life-threatening pregnancy complications, many of them will not know what they are legally permitted to do, and in fear, they will let their patients die. Some of those who make the other choice, and help their patients live, will be arrested. All of this will create legal precedents that erode American freedom, making life more burdensome, more brutish, and less safe. There are ways to fight. Of course, legal rulings aside, American women do not derive their moral right to control their own bodies from the US supreme court; they derive it from their human dignity. And many of them will seek and provide abortions, whether the court likes it or not, in accordance with this higher, more noble law. Others will donate to the abortion funds that will be in dire need of support as costs and demand skyrocket. Still others will spread the word about organizations like Plan C, which mails abortion pills to women in the US from abroad. Some will call their senators, and demand that the US Senate seize upon this moment of popular outrage to abolish the filibuster and pass the Women’s Health Protection Act before the moment fades and it’s too late. And some will call their state representatives and urge them to adopt the most aggressive pro-choice laws possible, in advance of what is coming. But none of this changes the fact that the reversal of Roe will come at an intolerable human cost. Abortion has so frequently been spoken of as a “high stakes” or “hot button” political issue that it is easy to lose sight of the foundational dignity that the right provides to women and others. The state compelling a person to be pregnant is not like compelling her to pay taxes. The event doesn’t occur in a courtroom or on a balance sheet; it occurs inside her body. The question at hand is whether half of the country will have control over their own insides, or whether the government can be so intimate and torturous that it can enforce its will even inside their own organs. And, in turn, the question is whether she can have the dignity and the freedom to choose her own family, to shape her own life – or whether that freedom is withheld based on her sex. Some have raised doubts about whether America can call itself a democracy, now that policymaking power has been largely taken over by the unelected courts – whose decisions, like this one, are so radically out of step with, and indifferent to, public opinion. But it is also worth wondering whether any country can call itself a democracy that does not protect abortion rights. In making abortion illegal, the court is imposing a legal status that is so cruel, so personal, and so life-altering on half its population, that those subject to this imposition cannot be called free. Is there any condition more essential to democratic citizenship than a person’s control over her own body? Can we call ourselves a free country without it?
