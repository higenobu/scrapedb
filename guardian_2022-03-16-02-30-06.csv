3/16/2022,"Jack Monroe’s powerful comments to the work and pensions select committee tell us more about the social security system than some MPs might have realised (Cost of living crisis could be fatal for some UK children, Jack Monroe tells MPs, 9 March). Eight years ago, Monroe told an all-party parliamentary inquiry into hunger, on which I served as secretary, that “if my benefits had been paid quickly, in full and on time, I would have been able to meet my living costs”. The cruel caps, cuts and freezes to which the social security budget has been subjected since then mean that, in Monroe’s words to the committee last week, even a 6% increase in April “is not going to adequately cover the difference in cost of living, plugging the gap for what people haven’t had for so long”. Simultaneously, while Monroe was giving evidence to the committee, one of Feeding Britain’s affordable food clubs was reporting that it was serving a new group of people who, for the first time, find themselves on the edge of crisis. Unless April’s increase in benefits is bound more closely to the rising cost of living, the size of this new group will expand at an alarming rate.Andrew ForseyNational director, Feeding Britain  Last week, I was asked if I knew of any way that a single mother of two could get help to pay for an oil delivery. She could not afford the minimum 500-litre order, the price of which has nearly doubled since her last order. I searched diligently, but while there is help for users of energy firms, there appears to be none for those who have to pay for their heating upfront, be it oil, bottled gas or even solid fuel. Here in rural Northumberland, we have no access to mains gas and even the moderately well-off are sinking into fuel poverty. This is causing real hardship and needs a rethink from the government. Taxes on wealth and excess profits, and stopping wealth being hoarded offshore, would help the economy work the way it should, supporting the most vulnerable. What we lack is a government with vision, courage, a sense of urgency and basic competence coupled with an understanding that the world has changed. I’ve left off wishing for compassion, fearing that that is too much to ask.Pam WalkerAssociate minister, Upper Wansbeck churches, Northumberland  I am surprised that there has been so little adverse comment on the large increases in daily standing charges that many gas and electricity companies have imposed as part of higher energy prices coming into force. Standing charges favour large fuel users over small ones. They disincentivise customers from reducing fuel use, and penalise poor and small households. The companies say standing charges reflect the cost of maintaining a gas or electricity connection, while the variable (per kWh) charge reflects the cost to them of purchasing power supplies. But the price of maintaining connections has not increased at all. It is the cost of buying wholesale gas and electricity that has gone up sharply, so there is no justification for raising standing charges. Ofgem says that the way firms structure their prices is up to them, provided they stay within the overall price cap. This ignores the important energy efficiency and social equity arguments against standing charges. It is time for the regulator to look again at this blatant rip-off of poorer customers.Peter CarterFormer deputy director general, Office of Electricity Regulation  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/16/2022,"Your report (Johnson announces terms of reference for Covid inquiry, 10 March) says that Lady Hallett, its chair, “will not be asked to apportion blame for any failures she identifies”. This means systemic failure is built into the inquiry. The principal role of the government is to design, maintain, implement and adapt systems. When those systems fail, it can be because of genuinely unforeseeable events. That was not the case with Covid; it was because the systems were badly designed or weren’t implemented. Blame is perhaps an ugly word, but preventing its identification also means that accountability is excluded, and without accountability, what sort of a joke of a democracy do we have? As the head of policy at the Royal Statistical Society wrote in your pages, “We shouldn’t blame mutant maths for poor policy outcomes” (From A-levels to pensions, algorithms make easy targets – but they aren’t to blame, 17 August 2021). Ascribing system failures to the systems themselves is just another way of evading responsibility for incompetence. Somebody chose that system, or chose to neglect it. Constructing the system for the inquiry to exclude accountability is building failure into its design.Dr Tony BrauerJordans, Buckinghamshire  It is incredibly disrespectful to the families of the tens of thousands of people who died at home during the pandemic for their experiences to be omitted from the terms of reference for the Covid-19 inquiry. People are dying without the vital support they need. Since the start of the pandemic, Hospice UK estimates that almost 67,000 people are likely to have missed out on specialist palliative care such as adequate pain relief. The inquiry presents an opportunity to bring this issue to light and to make sure that people are able to get the care they need. Without urgent action to find out what happened to the people dying behind closed doors, we won’t know what they experienced and thousands more could still miss out on the expert care that they deserve. Vital lessons need to be learned from the experiences of people dying at home to uncover crucial information so that people can be better supported at the end of life.Dominic CarterHead of policy and research, Hospice UK  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/16/2022,"The Speaker of the House of Lords has urged ministers to toughen up the vetting and appointment system for new peers following concerns about the suitability of recent nominees such the Evening Standard proprietor, Evgeny Lebedev. While the Speaker, Lord McFall, has no powers to limit peers’ access to parliament, his strongly-worded comment came in response to a request from the SNP for the Russia-born peer’s parliamentary pass to be revoked. Ministers have defended his appointment by his close friend Boris Johnson in 2020 after the Sunday Times reported that security services originally had concerns about Lebedev, whose father was a KGB agent, as far back as 2013. In a letter to McFall, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said the reported concerns of security services meant Lebedev’s pass should be rescinded. McFall does not have this power. But in a statement in response to the letter, he called for ministers to consider stronger powers for the House of Lords appointments commission (Holac), which vets candidates. Johnson is understood to have pushed forward the nomination despite Holac’s concerns about Lebedev. There was, McFall said, “a case for examination of the appointments process, including a more robust vetting system and potentially stronger powers for Holac, ensuring that new appointees are able to make a worthwhile contribution to the important work of the house. “I would urge the government to look at this, drawing upon the work of those who have already taken extensive evidence on this and proposed sensible reforms. I am always open to engagement with the government on these matters. “An examination of the appointments system is, however, just one element of what needs to be a bigger package of reform of the House of Lords, including reducing the size of the house and increasing the diversity of its members allowing us to reach out to all parts of the United Kingdom.” Since his appointment, Lebedev has spoken only once in the Lords. After a report noted this last month, he submitted two parliamentary questions. Johnson has been accused of brushing off security concerns about Lebedev, which whom he has a close relationship, attending parties at his Italian castle, including when he was foreign secretary. In his letter to McFall, Blackford said that given the reported security concerns, “Lord Lebedev is clearly not a fit and proper person to act as a legislator nor a lobbyist in this democracy. He should not therefore be in a position to maintain privileged access to the parliamentary estate”. Asked about Lebedev on Sunday, Michael Gove, the communities secretary, appeared to suggest that reopening the question of the peerage would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin. “I think one of the things that Vladimir Putin would like us to do, is to have an approach in the UK that said that everyone of Russian ancestry was somehow persona non grata,” he said. Lebedev has insisted that he is not a security risk, and that he condemns Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While the Lord Speaker has limited powers over peers, those in the role can and do express concerns about the wider running of the upper house. In 2019 McFall’s predecessor as Speaker, Lord Fowler, said the Lords should reduce the number of “passengers” who contributed little to its business. He also wanted to slim down the chamber to a planned ceiling of 600. There are currently about 800 members.",News/Politics,Lord Speaker urges ministers to tighten system for vetting peers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/15/lord-speaker-urges-ministers-to-tighten-system-for-vetting-peers
3/16/2022,"Over two nights this week, millions of viewers watched the horror that was ITV’s Jeremy Kyle Show exposed. The two-part investigation, Jeremy Kyle: Death in Daytime, on Channel 4, suggested that the production team lied to vulnerable participants, some of whom had obvious mental health issues, with sometimes terrible consequences. The Jeremy Kyle Show was taken off air only after one victim, Steve Dymond, “failed” a lie detector test on the show and killed himself a week later. It was also revealed that at least one other participant had killed herself after appearing on the programme years earlier – and the investigation hinted there were potentially more cases. But the programme’s greatest shock lay not in its content but in what – or who – was not on screen. It approached more than 200 people who had worked on the Jeremy Kyle Show over 14 years, and not a single one would go on camera. Just four junior members of the production team and a camera operator agreed to be interviewed anonymously. Actors played them on the actual programme. We were told they were too afraid to appear. One commented that if they did so, they would never work again – as if the threat of blacklisting by ITV was so powerful. Compare this with the bravery of the ordinary people who so often appear on ITV. As it happens, I began my career at ITV, and the first programme I produced was about rape in marriage, not then a crime in this country. Women appeared face-to-camera in the programme, thus identifying not just themselves but also their rapist husbands. Truly brave. I produced many more programmes over the years in which people talked to camera about being hunted by the mafia, terrorised by murderous street gangs and raped by war criminals. Yet when journalists, producers and researchers were themselves asked to talk about their experiences working in television, not a single one was prepared to come forward. Are TV bosses really scarier than the mafia and Vladimir Putin? I felt ashamed for my profession that not a single person was prepared to put their head above the parapet. But here is where it gets complicated. Nearly all the people who worked on Jeremy Kyle were quite new to television. For many it was their first big break. The four production team members who agreed to be interviewed anonymously were all from northern, working-class backgrounds. That’s pretty unusual in TV, where most are middle class and many from the south of England and top universities. For the young producers on Jeremy Kyle, landing a job on a network television programme was the potential start of a glamorous career. Their own backgrounds were not dissimilar to those of the programme’s participants. It is clear that those staff who victimised the guests should perhaps partly be seen as victims themselves. They confessed that they lied to people to persuade them to go on TV, terrified they would be sacked if they failed – in some cases they said they were explicitly told they would be fired if they didn’t succeed. “You were just, like, always acting,” said one. The staff admitted they would put family members in separate rooms and incite them to anger by relaying damaging comments each had allegedly made about the other. “You were always winding people up.” They were supposed to subject people to a “mental health checklist” but missed out important details so they would pass. “You would quite often lie.” They would work until four or five in the morning, sometimes, up to 14 or 15 hours nonstop. They knew what they were doing was wrong. The camera operator said, “What will haunt me for the rest of my days was that I didn’t do anything about it.” Under intense pressure, they lost their moral compasses. It was revealed that there were frequent calls from participants saying they were going to kill themselves, but the production team felt they themselves were helpless to press for the programmes to be cancelled. “There was probably a Steve Dymond type every week,” was one chilling admission. Of course, there was a very long “right to reply” from ITV at the end of the programme saying there were proper procedures in place to protect participants. Executives have publicly called it a “conflict resolution” programme. When I was a TV boss, I always refused to obey instructions to say ludicrous things like that. And if ITV was so confident in the programme’s rectitude, why did it take it off air after Dymond’s death? A show producer involved in the programme in which he appeared also killed herself soon after. So what should the television industry take from this hapless tale? Jeremy Kyle was photographed on a beach by a tabloid last week, presumably to symbolise that he is out of the business and all washed up. The regulator Ofcom has introduced tough new rules to protect programme participants. Broadcasters have strengthened their whistleblowing procedures. But in the end there’s only so much outside regulation can do. It also comes down to leadership. When I spoke at training courses at Channel 4, I would say that when people felt pressure to do something wrong, they should ask themselves, “What would my granny think if she knew I was doing this?” That’s still good advice, but it’s not just up to low-ranking employees to be the moral conscience of the industry. TV bosses need to keep repeating that there’s no place for the Kyle style of culture, so the question doesn’t even need to come up.

3/16/2022,"The Queen’s art collection has become involved in the cultural boycott of Russia by withdrawing permission for three swords to be displayed at the Kremlin Museums in Moscow. The Royal Collection had agreed to loan the 17th-century weapons as part of an exhibition about duelling, sponsored by the Russian oligarch and former fencer Alisher Usmanov, who had sanctions imposed upon him by the UK, EU and US earlier this month over his ties to Vladimir Putin. The Guardian can reveal that the Royal Collection withdrew permission in mid-February as more than 100,000 Russian troops amassed on Ukraine’s borders before the invasion on 24 February. The Queen’s collection was among a number of European institutions to pull out of the Moscow exhibition, forcing its postponement. The Duel: from Trial by Combat to a Noble Crime had been due to start on 4 March but the Kremlin Museums announced an indefinite delay. It said: “The core of the project consists of exhibits from European museums, which were forced to withdraw them before the time due to the geopolitical situation.” A spokesperson for the Queen’s Collection said: “A decision to postpone a loan of three swords from the Royal Collection to the Kremlin Museums in Moscow was made in mid-February.” She did not elaborate. The swords all date from the early 17th century, including one that is said to have belonged to King Charles I. The Queen’s swords had been expected to feature in the exhibition, as examples of weapons used in historic duels. A Kremlin Museums press release archived on the web had listed the Queen and the Royal Armouries museum in Leeds as key participant lenders to the exhibition, along with other European institutions including the Louvre in Paris, Madrid’s Prado and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The Royal Armouries museums confirmed it loaned six items to Moscow, including a duelling 17th-century gauntlet, a cavalry helmet and breastplate from the civil war. It said the items were on their way back from Russia after being recalled. “Due to the escalation of the situation in Ukraine, the Royal Armouries recalled the loan items. This mirrors the process that other major European collections have gone through regarding the items from their collections that are also on loan as part of this exhibition,” it said. “The Moscow Kremlin Museums have acted professionally and collaboratively throughout, and the items have left Russia and are en route through Europe.” The Kremlin Museums also requested engraved Henry VIII armour, on display in the Tower of London, but this was refused. The Armouries said: “We made the decision not to lend this item as it is required to travel with Royal Armouries’ staff accompaniment, which was not possible in the circumstances.” The French authorities have suggested the move to withhold permission for loaned works to be displayed in Moscow was coordinated among the European institutions. A spokesperson for the French culture minister, Roselyne Bachelot, was quoted in Le Monde as saying: “Our presence could have been exploited as a sign of divergence among Europeans. There was no question of disassociating ourselves [from the other European lenders].” They suggested correspondence with the Kremlin Museums had remained cordial and had taken place “without any evident hostility”. The main sponsor of the exhibition was listed as Usmanov’s art, science and sports foundation. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Usmanov was one of the first Russians to be sanctioned by the UK, US and EU, who described him as “one of Vladimir Putin’s favourite oligarchs”. He responded by accusing the the EU of “false and defamatory allegations”. This month, Usmanov stepped down as president of the International Fencing Federation, saying he would suspend his duties “until justice is restored”. The archived press release from the Kremlin Museums gave a potted history of duels, which makes interesting reading in the context of the invasion of Ukraine. It says: “In a judicial duel, God was believed to help the one standing up for a righteous cause, even if the opponent was more powerful, as it happened in the Old Testament battle of David and Goliath.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has frequently been likened to a modern-day David fighting the Russian Goliath. A rapier sword that was due to be loaned by the Queen depicts David beheading Goliath on its sculpted hilt.",News/UK news,Queen joins cultural boycott of Russia by withholding swords destined for Moscow,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/queen-cultural-boycott-russia-swords-moscow-royal-collection-ukraine
3/16/2022,"Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants accused of planning the 9/11 attacks are reportedly in talks with US prosecutors over a potential plea deal that would see them plead guilty in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. The New York Times reported that negotiations are under way for a possible plea agreement that could bring to an end what is arguably the biggest criminal case in US history. The five defendants were first charged in 2008 with plotting or logistically supporting the terrorist attacks that led to the murder of almost 3,000 people in New York’s Twin Towers, the Pentagon in Washington, and in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Pre-trial procedures under the so-called military commissions that were especially devised for the terror suspects held at Guantánamo Bay have been going on for more than a decade. But they have been consistently bogged down in technical and ethical disputes, foremost of which has been the long-running debate over whether the defendants can ever receive a fair trial given the torture to which they were subjected. The five defendants are: Mohammed, who by his own account was the mastermind of 9/11; Mohammed’s nephew Ammar al-Baluchi; Walid bin Attash, who is alleged to have helped train two of the 19 hijackers; Ramzi bin al-Shibh, accused of organizing logistics in the attack; and Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, alleged to have arranged financing. All five men were subjected to torture techniques euphemistically referred to as “enhanced interrogation techniques” in secret CIA prisons or “black sites”. Mohammed was subjected to waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning, 183 times. Details of the harrowing torture inflicted on Baluchi by CIA interrogators at a black site known as the Salt Pit outside Kabul surfaced this week in a new court filing. An official report by the CIA’s inspector general recounted how the detainee was repeatedly slammed against a plywood wall as a form of training for new “interrogation students”. Negotiations over a possible guilty plea are likely to take some time, the New York Times reported. Were a deal finally reached, it could have significant consequences, not only for the five defendants but for the future of Guantánamo itself. One of the key demands raised by the prisoners in a joint submission, the newspaper reported, is that they be allowed to serve the entirety of their sentences at Guantánamo, the military prison established at a US naval base in Cuba after 9/11. The prisoners are allowed to pray and eat collectively at the camp – privileges that might be withheld them were they transferred to maximum security prisons in mainland US, where solitary confinement is the norm. That in turn might involve the US government agreeing to keep Guantánamo open for decades to come, given the life sentences without any chance of parole that would almost certainly be meted out for Mohammed and at least some of the other defendants. Joe Biden, like Barack Obama before him, has expressed a desire to close the prison, though the task has so far proved elusive. Any plea agreement would also require sensitive handling both politically and in terms of the thousands of family members of 9/11 victims, some of whom have been vocal in demanding the death chamber for their loved ones’ murderers.",News/US news,Accused 9/11 plotters reportedly in talks over deal to avoid death penalty trial,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/september-11-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-prosecutors-plea-deal-report
3/16/2022,"Russian shells and missiles have again pounded Kyiv, killing at least five people and prompting city hall to impose a 35-hour curfew from Tuesday night amid signs the invading force was tightening its grip on the Ukrainian capital. As Polish, Czech and Slovenian prime ministers were due to arrive in the embattled city on Tuesday in a symbolic show of European solidarity, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said it faced “a difficult and dangerous moment”. After repeated bombardments and almost encircled by Russian forces, about half of Kyiv’s 3.5 million pre-war residents have fled, officials have said, with many of those who remain spending their nights sheltering in underground stations. Klitschko promised it would not surrender. “The capital is the heart of Ukraine, and it will be defended,” he said. “Kyiv, which is currently the symbol and the forward operating base of Europe’s freedom and security, will not be given up by us.” As the number of refugees fleeing the country continued to climb, Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki, the Czech leader, Petr Fiala, and Janez Janša of Slovenia were set to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to express the EU’s “unequivocal support” for Ukraine. “It is our duty to be where history is forged,” Morawiecki said. “Because it’s not about us but about the future of our children who deserve to live in a world free from tyranny.” The trio would also present “a concrete support package”, officials said. The series of four heavy pre-dawn explosions rocked residential districts of Kyiv early on Tuesday, hours before talks between Ukraine and Russia were set to resume. “Streets have been turned into a mush of steel and concrete,” said the head of the capital region, Oleksiy Kuleba. “People have been hiding for weeks in basements.” In the east, the airport in Dnipro also sustained massive damage overnight, while Russian forces launched more than 60 strikes on Ukraine’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, according to the regional administration chief, Oleh Sinehubov. The strikes hit the city’s historic centre, including the main marketplace. The UN said that nearly 1.4 million children – almost one every second – had left Ukraine since the invasion began on 24 February. The International Organization for Migration said more than 3 million people had now fled the Russian onslaught, in what NGOs have called Europe’s biggest refugee crisis since the second world war. One strike on Kyiv hit a 16-storey housing block where fire raged and smoke billowed from the shattered skeleton of the building, as emergency services and stunned locals navigated an obstacle course of glass, metal and other debris littering the road. Ukraine was “fighting for life”, Zelenskiy said. “We are fighting against tanks, planes and mortars that Russia is using to destroy us. But Russia is also destroying itself. Every shot against Ukraine, this is a step that Russia takes to destroy itself, to self-isolate … everybody leaves Russia now, all who can think.” He warned that Russia’s “war machine” would inevitably target more western countries if it was not stopped by coordinated international action. “We can stop Russia,” he said. “We can stop the killing of people. Else they will also come to you.” Civilian evacuations from some of Ukraine’s hardest-hit cities continued on Tuesday, with authorities in the devastated southern port of Mariupol saying 2,000 civilian vehicles had left the city along a 260km (160-mile) “humanitarian corridor” to the Ukraine-held city of Zaporizhzhia. Another 2,000 cars were waiting to leave Mariupol which has been under heavy bombardment for more than two weeks and is largely without power, heating or water. But Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said a convoy with supplies for Mariupol was stuck outside the city. Civilians trapped in the besieged city were “essentially being suffocated with no aid”, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said, adding that people there were “facing the impossible choices of how to feed their families and themselves and are trapped”. Peace talks between the two sides resumed on Tuesday, meanwhile, with the Ukrainian president sounding cautiously optimistic. The Russians had “begun to understand they will not achieve anything by war”, he said, adding that Monday’s round was “pretty good … but let’s see. They will continue.” While previous talks focused on humanitarian issues, the latest aim to achieve a ceasefire, secure Russian troop withdrawals and establish security guarantees for Ukraine, Kyiv has said. The Russian delegate, Leonid Slutsky, suggested draft agreements may not be far off. Russia again claimed on Tuesday, without evidence, that US advisers in Ukraine were helping Kyiv develop biological and nuclear weapons. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, said foreign consultants in Ukraine represented “a new threat” to Russia’s security and were potentially raising the risk of nuclear war. The US has categorically denied Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims “laughable” and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon itself. Russia’s military progress has been slow and costly, with the Kremlin apparently underestimating the strength of Ukrainian resistance. Military experts believe Russia’s military now needs time to regroup and resupply its troops, paving the way for a possible pause or slowdown in fighting. Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff, voiced hope that a shortage of Russian resources could lead to some form of peace agreement by May at the latest, with more minor clashes continuing possibly for up to a year. “We are at a fork in the road now: there will either be a peace deal struck very quickly, within a week or two, with troop withdrawal and everything, or there will be an attempt to scrape together some, say, Syrians for a round two, and, when we grind them too, an agreement by mid-April or late April,” Arestovich said. Russia has drawn up lists of 40,000 Syrian army and pro-regime militia fighters to be put on standby for deployment in Ukraine, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Tuesday. Reports from Syria said Russian officers had already set up registration offices in regime-held areas. After US assertions that Moscow had turned to Beijing for military and economic help, China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, insisted the country was “not a party to the crisis – still less does it want to be affected by the sanctions”. The west has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia over the invasion, hitting billionaire oligarchs close to the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, freezing state assets and cutting off much of the country’s corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Moscow to change course. The EU on Tuesday formally agreed a fourth package of measures, including an import ban on a range of steel products, a ban on most new investment in Russia’s energy sector, an EU export ban on luxury goods and a ban on the rating of Russia and Russian companies by EU credit rating agencies. The sanctions also include a travel ban and asset freeze on Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club. The UK also announced sanctions on a further 370 Russian individuals, including more than 50 oligarchs and their families, with a combined net worth of £100bn.",News/World news,Kyiv facing ‘dangerous moment’ amid signs of Russia’s tightening grip,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/kyiv-facing-dangerous-moment-amid-signs-of-russias-tightening-grip
3/16/2022,"It is March 2020 and a new illness called “coronavirus” means 3.7 million people with pre-existing health conditions in England are being told by the government to shield at home. As someone with weak breathing muscles in a respiratory pandemic, my mind goes to the important question: is there anything good on TV? With all entertainment venues – and basic human contact – off limits, reacquainting myself with an old friend called television seems like a plan. I start with BBC iPlayer’s Him and Her: an alternative romantic comedy about people who never leave their flat seems fitting. As the world goes to hell, I continue with the genre known as “incredibly wholesome”: Schitt’s Creek; Ted Lasso; Ghosts. When TV soap production stops, I have even more time on my hands and decide to take this pursuit seriously. I use the hours to finally finish shows I let fall by the wayside in more sociable times. Parks and Recreation. Orange is the New Black. Pandemics apparently curb productivity, but not from where I’m sitting. As the months go on, the rest of the country returns to newly reopened cinemas and theatres, but, for shielders like me, entertainment is still confined to my front room. National Theatre at Home transports me to my local playhouse for The Madness of King George. Grayson’s Art Club takes me to galleries filled with colour and light. Disney+’s WandaVision creates cinematic wonder for the small screen. I find myself using television as therapy and company. Classic epsiodes of The Simpsons make me laugh. Feel Good lets me cry. A BritBox subscription takes me from Rev to Twenty Twelve and, with it, to a pre-Covid era. It is comforting to notice eternal truths. Boris Johnson should not be allowed near public office. Olivia Colman really is in everything. By spring 2021, I enter what I call the time travel phase, watching classics I was too young for when first broadcast (This Life) and rewatching shows I was technically too young for at the time but saw anyway (the entire Sex and the City box set). As I get used to working fully from home, I break the day with Steph’s Packed Lunch. Linda Barker is crafting with Michael Portillo. Denise van Outen is wrestling a small dog. You don’t get this in the office. Two years on and Boris Johnson has removed the last Covid measures in England. Many clinically vulnerable people who were venturing out worry they will have to return to a life indoors. Others are balancing the pros and cons, weighing up isolation versus safety. For my part, I risk a visit from my two-year-old niece. To ease meeting for the first time in a while, we stick on CBeebies’ Hey Duggee. She is visibly impressed that I know Duggee, too, as if she believes he exists in a magic box in her house and I have coaxed him out to visit mine. Perhaps television is a magic box. It may not solve our problems in the toughest of times but it is there for us through them, a little glow of escapism in the corner to remind us what we are and how to feel. We asked Guardian readers how television helped them through shielding. Here are some of their e. Ruth Murran, 52, from Co Durham, who has cerebral palsy“Television has given me routine, a window to the world, a chance to learn things and something I can share with family and friends I’m separated from. I turned to Killing Eve and The Tourist (I often focus on programmes with people who are having a worse time than me!). I watch House of Games while my parents play along in Warwick at the same time. Say Yes to the Dress offers a way to be temporarily absorbed by something that doesn’t really matter. My husband has been drawn in too.” Jenni Mills, 69 from Wiltshire, who has rheumatoid arthritis“At the start of the pandemic, I set up a WhatsApp group for furloughed colleagues and we found ourselves WhatsApping each other about what we were watching on TV. We’d chat as we watched music documentaries on BBC Four and old Top of The Pops repeats, sharing memories – and sometimes photos – of what we’d been doing when that music was in the charts. Television became a way of feeling less isolated, knowing friends were watching the same programme at the same time.” Rory McDaid, 33 from Suffolk, is immunocompromised due to medication“TV has helped as a constant, ever present distraction. Whether it’s something I’m watching on repeat – like Friends and Taskmaster – or something zeitgeist-y – like The Mandalorian – that makes you feel like part of a collective experience, it has always been there. Foundation on Apple TV+ was one of my favourite shows of 2021. Various animated shows, such as Jujutsu Kaisen and Ranking of Kings, have been gems. Reacher has been a fun distraction. A huge guy punching his way out of most problems has perhaps been a reflection of my anger at the world!” Anonymous“Without TV, I truly believe I would have become seriously emotionally unwell while shielding. I turned to Detectorists, Foyle’s War, The Great Pottery Throwdown, The Dog House, 24 Hours in A&E, The Great British Sewing Bee. Just being able to sit down with others – real and imagined – helped. TV has allowed me to remember what it is to be human. Simon Hawtin, 46 from Bristol, who has ME“I’ve finished entire series on their day of release. Seen almost every Premier League goal on MOTD2. Shared the joy of new Star Wars stories with my kids. Through times of stress, sickness and isolation, television has been my companion and my comfort blanket. There’s a moment at the start of Gardeners’ World where the camera is still, there is no voiceover or music, simply the sound of bird song. At a time when my life felt completely empty and bleak, those moments gave me a sense of joy and hope that the world was still a beautiful place.” Anonymous from Leeds, who has asthma“My mother died at the start of the pandemic and I’ve had to adjust to living alone and shielding. We always watched an episode of something every evening while having dinner, and I decided to continue that. I finished watching Gilmore Girls, which I started when Mum was in hospital. I finished Heartland, which I’d been watching with Mum. I was sad that she wouldn’t see the characters get married.” Denise Nolson, 52 from Stroud, has ME, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rheumatoid arthritis“I would be climbing the walls without television. Anything from The Haunting of Hill House, Carnival Row and Stranger Things to The Walking Dead and Bridgerton. For me TV provides simple, pure escapism, a way of shutting off from the real world and losing myself for a few hours at a time. The great thing about stories is, as when we were children, there may be struggles but generally good triumphs over bad. Hope is rewarded.” Did a particular show lift your spirits during shielding?

3/16/2022,"Queensland’s eight biggest lobbyists have donated more than $430,000 to Labor and the LNP since the start of 2020, amid concern from integrity experts who say laws should be changed to prohibit the sector from making any political donations. AJ Brown, a professor of public policy and law at Griffith University and a board member of Transparency International Australia, told Guardian Australia that donations from lobbyists should be banned outright. He said concerns stemmed from the fact a lobbyist’s core business is to promote the interests of third-party clients. “It defeats the purpose of donation transparency,” Brown said. “It’s wrong. There’s no way to eradicate the risk [that donations may be perceived as coming indirectly from lobbyists’ clients].” Brown said “the same principle” should also be applied to large accounting or professional services firms that work for third-party clients and governments, and which should also “not be making donations to political parties”. Queensland has banned donations from property developers and property industry bodies. Some of those banned donors are represented by lobbyists who are allowed to make their own political contributions. Since 2020, a state election year, eight large lobbying firms have made regular donations to both major Queensland political parties. The vast majority of that money has gone to Labor, which has been in power in Queensland since 2015. The biggest donor in that period was Anacta Strategies, run by Labor figures Evan Moorhead and David Nelson, who gave more than $160,000 to the Queensland Labor party. Nelson said the company made “no apologies for being a Labor firm” and would continue to support the party within the rules. He said Anacta supported ongoing regulation of political donations and that all the company’s donations had been declared in accordance with the law. “Queensland has some of the strictest regulations in the country, with real-time disclosures and donation caps,” he said. “Should the laws be tightened further we will continue to abide by them.” At a hearing of Queensland’s parliamentary economics and governance committee on Monday, the acting chief executive of the state’s Crime and Corruption Commission, Bruce Barbour, said there was a “serious and urgent need to reform lobbying laws”. “Lobbying must be conducted in an ethical and fully transparent manner,” Barbour said. At the committee hearing, lobbyists from three firms were asked by Mermaid Beach MP, Ray Stevens, whether they understood public concerns about the source of their donations. “Do you understand that the public have great concerns about the appearance of those large donations to political parties, particularly after the success of lobbying by a particular firm to achieve an outcome, and how that is bad for the public confidence in the lobbyist industry?” Stevens asked. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The managing director of Liberal-aligned lobbyist Barton Deakin, Andrew Humpherson, said donating to parties on behalf of clients would be regarded as “unethical” under their corporate code. The head of Labor-aligned lobbyist Hawker Britton’s Queensland practice, Elliot Stein, told the hearing his firm made political donations but that these were not made on behalf of their clients. “From our perspective we always welcome greater levels of transparency and disclosure,” Stein said. “Under our laws, and the nature of how elections are run and required to be funded, political parties will naturally need to attract private investment to run political activities. Any changes to that scheme is a matter for this parliament and we’d welcome it.” Electoral Commission Queensland rules require all donors to disclosure whether they are contributing on behalf of a third party. The CCC has expressed concern that lobbying regulation does not capture in-house lobbying, done by employees of larger companies, which are not subject to the same scrutiny as lobbying firms. Barbour told the committee he had concerns about “sham arrangements” where a company might hire what’s essentially a lobbyist but appoint them to an internal position which is not subject to disclosure. Lobbyist Paul Bini, from Crisis&Comms Co, noted that the electoral commission would require declaration of any donation by a third party. Bini told the committee about 80% to 90% of lobbying was done by larger companies with in-house lobbyists and that these interactions with government were not subject to the same scrutiny as lobbying firms. “With all due respect to the CCC, concerns about sham arrangements and those sorts of things is much less of an issue [than the fact] the regulation misses most lobbying activity. “To create balance and fairness for the clients of lobbyists … the current system in its current form should be expanded to in-house lobbyists.” Stein told the committee: “The activities of companies like ours are the tip of the iceberg.” “We’re out in the open, clear, transparent, reported and logged in the public domain. We welcome that transparency.”",News/Australia news,‘It’s wrong’: expert calls on Queensland to ban political donations from lobbyists,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/its-wrong-expert-calls-on-queensland-to-ban-political-donations-from-lobbyists
3/16/2022,"State Emergency Service units in some of the hardest-hit flood areas in northern New South Wales had warned the closure of regional offices in 2020 would reduce their ability to respond to natural disasters. Communication between the SES units and senior levels of the organisation reveals tension about a restructure which was blamed on NSW government budget cuts. In November 2020, 12 SES units in the Northern Rivers and Richmond valley wrote to the commissioner warning that a restructure “threaten[ed] the continued existence of units … and the future of the service”. The complaint was spearheaded by the Kyogle SES unit and co-signed by unit commanders including in Ballina, Broadwater, Casino, Coraki, Lismore, Mullumbimby, Murwillumbah, and Richmond Tweed – some of the towns worst affected by the recent floods. In response, the SES commissioner, Carlene York, conceded that “transformation did result in a reduction in staff” and had harmed “connection and support to units”. “However this was necessary to meet government savings targets,” she said. In the 2018 budget, the then NSW treasurer and now premier, Dominic Perrottet, increased the “efficiency dividend” for government departments from 2% to 3%. Unions warned at the time the measure would cost jobs and hurt services, but the government justified it on the basis it would “reduce back-office costs and focus expenditure where it is needed most”. The response by the state SES and Australian Defence Force to what authorities describe as a one-in-500-year flood has been sluggish, prompting criticism that local communities were left to conduct their own rescues and clean-up. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Most SES units do not conduct rescues and SES members do not blame the quality of the flood response on the restructure, but say it has contributed to a long-term decline in capacity responding to natural disasters. In the complaint, the SES units said the “removal of regional offices” had “pushed significant new administrative burdens on to volunteers, frustrating and demoralising dedicated members”. “Very experienced and skilful members have withdrawn from active participation in several units as a result of recent developments,” it said. New procedures for community engagement during Covid-19 had left the SES “increasingly invisible”, making it more difficult to attract volunteers and donations. “All volunteer services have suffered in recent decades but ours is becoming increasingly difficult. “Our active members grow older and our capacity to work for our community diminishes.” The new training regime was too focused on “keyboard and screen-based courses”, while “region-based training seems to have disappeared”, replaced by courses “hundreds of kilometres away” in Sydney or Newcastle. “The changes we have referred to here are undermining morale, cutting unit membership numbers and throwing up barriers to what we see as our essential roles as emergency service volunteers within and for our communities. “These are not trivial problems. They are serious concerns.” York responded that it was “regretful the cluster feels undervalued and disappointed”, blaming the closure of regional offices on “government savings targets” but promising to “endeavour to seek additional resources”. York promised consultation to fix deficiencies in training and that community engagement could recommence. “I want to assure you the staff at [SES headquarters] and throughout the zones are not remote bureaucrats, noting approximately 50% of staff are volunteers as well, having a very good understanding of the needs of units. “From what I have seen they sincerely want to support the volunteers.” Bob Mills, a former SES member and Labor staffer, told Guardian Australia the restructure had caused issues with “training, administration and coordination with ambulance, police and fire [the rural fire service]”. “Coordination used to be handled by the regional head office, who had everyone’s number and knew how to contact everyone,” Mills said. “Now each unit is supposed to know how to do it – and they just don’t.” “The state government is now throwing equipment at the SES but they’re not being trained to use it. There’s nobody to do the training and assessment.” Mills, who left the SES in January, said there had been meetings to address training issues, but they were still unresolved and “up in the air”. Mills thinks the increasing professionalisation of the SES points towards having a civil natural disaster authority, which Labor has said it will consider if elected. “My personal view is they’re going to have to go semi-professional, like the army reserve, with people who are on standby. “They’ve been doing this on the cheap, on a volunteer basis, but they’re now demanding very professional standards.” The minister for emergency services, resilience and flood recovery, Steph Cooke, declined to answer questions about why the government had imposed savings targets on the SES. “Internal SES reporting lines and structures are a matter for the SES,” she said. “The overall response to the 2022 floods will be subject to a review.” A NSW SES spokesperson said it “values the local knowledge and experience of our volunteer membership” and acknowledged that “recent weather events have increased the demand on NSW SES resources”. The spokesperson said the organisation “strives for continuous improvement”. “The NSW SES relies on community members volunteering their services, and we always seek additional volunteers into any unit across the state.”",News/Society,SES units in flood-hit NSW raised alarm in 2020 that restructure threatened ‘future of the service’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/ses-units-in-flood-hit-nsw-raised-alarm-in-2020-that-restructure-threatened-future-of-the-service
3/16/2022,"Emma Cassar is at the helm of one of Victoria’s biggest logistical challenges: completing and operating a new quarantine facility during a pandemic. The head of Victoria’s quarantine program is quick to point out that much of the state’s new purpose-built site was created in just nine months – “the time it takes to build a domestic house”. With capacity for 1,000 people once completed, the Mickleham quarantine hub on the northern fringes of Melbourne welcomed its first group of travellers last month, amid ongoing construction at the site. By the end of the month, when hotel quarantine arrangements end, it will be Victoria’s sole quarantine facility. Under Victoria’s Covid restrictions, all unvaccinated arrivals must undergo seven days of isolation upon their arrival in the state. Its construction was initially estimated to cost the commonwealth $200m, but the federal government now expects the total cost to reach $580m. The ongoing operational costs of the site – to be covered by the Victorian government – are yet to be publicly released. Despite being dubbed a “white elephant” by critics, the federal and Victorian governments argue that a purpose-built facility is crucial in the ongoing battle against Covid, future variants and other pandemics. The loosening of Covid restrictions in Victoria means the sprawling site can have as few as 10 to 15 residents at one time. The site opened late last month with a 500-bed capacity and will ramp up to full capacity by April. While the Omicron wave has receded, there are concerns that winter could see a spike in case numbers. “Having lived this pandemic for the last two years, the one thing we know is when we think we understand it, we’re quickly shown by this virus how quickly it can change, and we certainly see really big numbers over in the UK and Canada,” Cassar says. “It is the safest possible facility that we can have for a pandemic.” Adult travellers must pay a fee of $1,500 to stay at the facility, with $500 charged for each additional adult and $250 for children aged three to 18. The centre is also open to Victorians unable to safely isolate at home, including close contacts or frontline workers, free of charge. But the site has potential to be used for alternative purposes. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, this month flagged that it could be used as short-term accommodation for Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion. Cassar also points to domestic violence victims and flood evacuees as groups the facility could house, and says these alternative accommodation uses were front of mind during the design process. “We’re even thinking about the services that we could provide, if there were outages or failures in hospital catering … we could pick those things up as well,” she says. At full capacity, the site would be run by 600 staff rotating across a 24-hour roster. The four villages – each with a 250-person capacity – consist of cabin-like accommodation with the aesthetic of a budget hotel. Guests arriving at the 22-hectare site are checked in by a staff member, stationed behind a glass window, via an intercom. The cabin’s wrap-around balconies, mirroring the Northern Territory’s Howard Springs quarantine facility, allow guests to indulge in fresh air and sunshine. “Balconies, to someone who hasn’t done quarantine, doesn’t sound like much,” Cassar says. “But when you can’t go out and get fresh air, it’s incredibly distressing.” The facility boasts a state-of-the-art kitchen, contactless food ordering and room service, laundry and waste facilities. There are also accessible rooms for guests with disability. But at the heart of its design is strict infection-control protocol. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The site is divided into “red zones” – comprising guest accommodation and hence a higher Covid risk – and “green zones”, where staff members work. Purpose-built individual ventilation systems snake above the rooms, which are each also fitted with an air-purifier. The free-standing rooms are connected via footpaths and not corridors – a source of transmission in quarantine hotels. Five hundred CCTV cameras are installed to ensure residents remain on site for their quarantine period. The announcement of the facility in April last year came amid drawn-out discussion over the funding split and divergent views on the best use of the facility. While the Victorian government invested an initial $15m for its design, Cassar says Quarantine Victoria is still liaising with the state government to determine how many beds would be operational and the ongoing costs. “As we’ve done previously, all that will be made publicly available,” she says.

We’ve never been complacent with thinking that we’ve understood this,” Cassar says. “We’ve constantly sought to both reflect and learn from each state, and international colleagues. And we’ve really developed expertise.”",News/Australia news,"Victoria’s $580m hub for 1,000 visitors awaits the end of hotel quarantine",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/victorias-580m-hub-for-1000-visitors-awaits-the-end-of-hotel-quarantine
3/16/2022,"Women with genes that predispose them to endometriosis also have a higher risk of developing certain ovarian cancers, new research suggests. A study of genetic markers in nearly 15,000 women with endometriosis and more than 25,000 women with ovarian cancer has found what researchers say is a causal link between the two conditions. “We have estimated that the odds of having ovarian cancer over a lifetime is up to 2.6 times higher for women carrying genetic risk factors for endometriosis,” said the study’s lead author, Dr Sally Mortlock of the University of Queensland. The genetic link was specific to certain kinds of epithelial ovarian cancer – the most common category, which accounts for an estimated 90% of cases. Endometriosis – a condition in which the tissue that lines the uterus also grows outside the uterus – affects an estimated one in 10 women of reproductive age. “Endometriosis affects as many women as diabetes and asthma yet it has not received the same level of attention or funding, leaving women to suffer in silence,” Mortlock said. Mortlock emphasised that while there was a “significant overlap in genetic risk factors” between the two conditions, the overall risk for developing ovarian cancer was still low. She said having endometriosis increased the risk of developing ovarian cancer to one in 55, compared with an estimated ovarian cancer risk of one in 76 women generally. “We explored specific areas of DNA that increase the risk of both diseases,” Mortlock said. The researchers found that women with 27 genetic markers – which have previously been strongly linked to endometriosis – were also more likely to have ovarian cancer. Using a statistical method known as Mendelian randomisation, the team were able to demonstrate a causal genetic link, and establish “directionality from endometriosis to EOC [epithelial ovarian cancer] risk rather than vice versa”. “Some of these genes have important roles controlling the ability of our cells to adhere, or stick, to each other and respond to hormones,” Mortlock said. “This gives us clues that these pathways might be important in disease development and progression.” The identified genes could be used as future drug targets to treat both conditions, she said. Tracy O’Mara, an associate professor at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the research demonstrated a causal relationship between the two conditions, which have previously been linked in epidemiological studies. “The relationship between endometriosis and ovarian cancer has [previously] been looked at observationally,” O’Mara said. “It’s nice that they’ve used these genetic techniques … it really shows the shared biology between the two.” One limitation of the study is that its DNA data only included women of European ancestry. “Whether the results can be extrapolated to other ethnic groups is something that would need to be looked at as well,” O’Mara said. The research was published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine.",News/Society,Women with genes for endometriosis have higher risk of ovarian cancer,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/women-with-genes-for-endometriosis-have-higher-risk-of-ovarian-cancer
3/16/2022,"The New South Wales treasurer, Matt Kean, believes the creation of a federal anti-corruption body is vital to safeguard Australia’s economic prosperity and rule of law. Just months out from the federal election, Kean used a speech to highlight the importance of “strong anti-corruption bodies” to hold every level of government accountable. The comments come after the federal attorney general, Michaelia Cash, in February dumped the Coalition’s 2019 election promise to create a commonwealth integrity commission. Speaking at a private event as part of the Social Good Summit Australia – a United Nations Foundation affiliate – earlier this month, Kean made his case for the body. “Our economic prosperity is built on the strength of our society,” he told the audience. “Our commerce depends on our security and safety. Our contracts depend on the rule of law and a judicial system that is free from corruption, and that’s why we need strong anti-corruption bodies – not just at the state level but also at the national level.” The Guardian understands the comments were made off the cuff and were not included in the written version of the speech later uploaded to the senior Coalition figure’s website. Kean has a history of needling his federal counterparts over issues including action on climate change and, most recently, on Covid economic support. High-profile investigations by the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption have divided members of the Liberal party room, most recently after the former premier Gladys Berejiklian resigned from her role during a probe in September. At the time, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, labelled the commission a “kangaroo court” and said the inquiry involving Berejiklian was “an absolute disgrace”. In late February the body found the former NSW Labor MP Ernest Wong engaged in corrupt conduct by concealing illegal political donations and then trying to get one of the fake donors to lie about it. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Investigations by the NSW body have also led to the resignation of former Liberal premier Barry O’Farrell and the expulsion of former MP Eddie Obeid from the Labor party, before he was jailed. The key word in Kean’s comment was “strong”, said Bill Browne, the senior researcher for the Australia Institute’s democracy and accountability program. He said a stronger commission than the model laid out in draft legislation presented by the Morrison government in 2020 was needed to ensure it had the right powers to do its job effectively. “It’s reassuring to hear calls from senior Liberals for an integrity commission and, more than that, a strong integrity commission at the federal level,” he said. “NSW – with Icac – has one of the stronger integrity commissions in Australia and we’ve seen the benefits that that can bring with exposing corruption where it exists. “The fact that we’re hearing now from senior Liberals demonstrates that the issue has been dragged out for too long.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app The premier, Dominic Perrottet, last year told the National Press Club that he supported the role of the commission in the state. “Icac in NSW plays a very important role in preventing corruption and uncovering corruption,” he said. “Ultimately, what we should be doing is instilling confidence, not taking it away.” Integrity is expected to shape up as a key federal election issue, with Labor and high-profile independents to campaign on the Coalition’s broken promise. In February, the Liberal MP for Bass, Bridget Archer, crossed the floor to support an independent integrity bill introduced by the Victorian independent MP Helen Haines. Archer criticised the government for failing to bring its own integrity bill to parliament, calling it “the most important thing we need to do” in this term. The same month, the moderate Liberal MP Jason Falinski told the Guardian the government should have introduced its proposed federal integrity commission to “start the debate”. “I am really disappointed that we are not going to put legislation to the parliament,” the Sydney MP said. Kean also said in his speech work needed to be done to ensure the state was an “educated society” and emphasised the importance of acting on climate change amid devastating floods. “The reality is that our economic prosperity does not come at the expense of the environment, it depends on it,” he said.

3/16/2022,"In modern football, entire months go by where nothing really happens, where the status quo is more or less maintained. In the 2021 grand final – in the time it takes to put the kettle on – a 57-year-old curse was buried. Halfway through the third quarter, the Western Bulldogs had kicked eight of the last nine goals. Marcus Bontempelli was playing himself into grand final folklore. Like a tiny bouncer ejecting a bikie, Caleb Daniel slung the biggest man in football onto the astro turf. The Demons were being outplayed and outcoached. Their defenders, the best in the competition all year, were pointing fingers, shaking heads and under siege. On SEN, Gerard Healy was laying into Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver. “I was shitting myself, to be honest,” Petracca later said. “We were probably one goal away from the game slipping away,” the coach, Simon Goodwin, conceded. Bailey Smith has the kind of mane you see in the mounting yard at Saratoga. He has 350,000 Instagram followers. But at a crucial stoppage on the wing, he had butter fingers. His pocket was picked by James Harmes, who weighted a perfect kick to Bailey Fritsch. He looks like an articled clerk. But he’s a lovely set shot. Goal. Deep breath. Game on. He wasn’t recognised in Norm Smith medal voting, and was left out of most best player lists, but ruckman Luke Jackson was a key cog in every passage of play that sealed this premiership. For the initial three-goal thrust, he was matched against Stefan Martin – about to turn 35 and playing his second game in three months. The All Australian captain and the hero of the preliminary final deferred to the teenager. “He’s the perfect matchup for Stef,” Max Gawn told his coach on the bench. In the space of a minute, with Bontempelli off resting, Jackson won two centre square contests. Petracca, moving like a speed skater, waltzed out the front of both stoppages. He finished with 40 disposals, two goals and 24 contested possessions. In the history of football, only Gary Ablett Jnr has managed those figures. Ablett did it in front of two lifeguards and a dog on the Gold Coast. Petracca did it in the most important game in his club’s history. The second thrust came in the dying seconds. The mad minute, Melbourne fans call it. This time, Jackson was matched against Tim English, who looks like he should be climbing beanstalks. This time, Bontempelli was back in the middle. This time, Beveridge came down to the bench to try and calm things down. All year, he’d spoken of tidal waves. He’d unleashed one against Port Adelaide a fortnight earlier. He’s often at his deadliest when his side is three or four goals down. But there was nothing he could do. This grand final was done. As Petracca dribbled his preposterous goal, the social commentator and Senate candidate Jane Caro fired out a tweet. “Dear most Aussies, who are the Dees? What is this thing you all care so much about?” Her answer came in the next few days, as footage emerged of Melbourne fans in lockdown. Every one of them is inured for disappointment. Their reactions veered from sullen silence, to relief, to incredulity, to utter certainty, to unbridled joy. It brought to mind George Graham at Anfield in 1989 – “Isn’t it lovely to have moments in your life where you think, ‘oh, nothing can beat that. Nothing’.” Ten weeks later, in the first week of summer, they gathered at the MCG. It wasn’t like the drunken euphoria at the Whitten Oval in 2016, or the bonnet-hopping mayhem on Swan Street the following year. It was clearer, more sober. It had surely sunk in by now. They started cheering four or five seconds before goals. They gave Neal Daniher a standing ovation. This time, the coach wasn’t bumped off stage by the mayor. In round one last year, just over 20,000 people turned up to the opening game against Fremantle. There was nothing particularly flashy about the Dees at that point. They looked tighter and more organised down back. They were finally hitting targets. They had a charmed run with injuries. They were winning in a host of different ways – grinding out wins, blowing teams away early, adjusting at half-time and storming home in the second half. They built the foundation, finally became trustworthy, ironed out some mid-winter chinks, and then went whoosh. Question marks remain over many of their major challengers. Luke Beveridge, looking like a sergeant-at-arms of the Bandinos, has called for a revolution. But what he really needs is a ruckman. So does Chris Scott. Brisbane and Port Adelaide keep throwing away home finals. Richmond can start anew after a 2021 where nothing went right. But their best player is coming off a lacerated kidney. He’s no longer the Champion of the Colony. The four leading candidates for that are all playing at the MCG on Wednesday night. Many Melbourne people, including the captain and coach, hinted that there was something a little underwhelming about burying the curse so far from home, that what they really coveted was a flag at the MCG. “Dynasty” is the most misused word in football. They have all the pieces, and all the motivation, to pick up where they left off in Perth. The first few weeks, you suspect, will be a giant victory lap for fans. But then comes the hard part. Then comes the winter grind, the challenge of being hunted, picked apart and copied, and of trying to replicate 30 minutes of almost perfect football.",Sport/Sport,Melbourne buried their AFL curse but Demons still long to lift flag at home | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/16/melbourne-buried-their-afl-curse-but-demons-still-long-to-lift-flag-at-home
3/16/2022,"On Monday The Cook Up with Adam Liaw will return to SBS Food for a second season. Each weeknight from 7pm, the celebrity cook will be joined by a pair of high-profile friends – everyone from the actor Pia Miranda to fellow MasterChef alumnus Julie Goodwin – for half an hour of food, fun and conversation. While The Cook Up is filmed in SydneyLiaw’s pre-pandemic adventures took him around the globe. Other food-centric shows saw the cook, writer and TV host explore everywhere from Scandinavia to Singapore. On one trip, filming his show Destination Flavour in China, Liaw happened upon an antique tea shop. There he found a silver tea tray that he instantly fell for – but didn’t manage bring home. Here Liaw tells us about the tea tray that got away, as well as the story of two other handy personal belongings. I hate to say something so seemingly trivial, but it’s probably my noise-cancelling headphones. I really, really don’t deal well with loud noises and these are absolute lifesavers. I wear them when I’m working, on planes, watching TV at night, and if I could get away with wearing them full-time around my kids without looking like a terrible father, I absolutely would. I find particular kinds of noise to be a big factor in how I perceive stress. I have no problems with music, or going to footy games or concerts and cheering my head off. But when it comes to combinations of noises like a TV going with an extractor fan and a video game all at the same time, I find it a little difficult. My headphones put in a lot of work as a stress-reduction tool – and if my house was on fire I’d probably have them on already. Hands down, my rice cooker. It gets used every single day without fail. We’ll usually have it on a timer so each morning we wake up to freshly cooked rice at 6am, and that pot will last us through to dinner. This one is a whiz-bang pressurised version from Korea and it makes fantastic rice. I add a mixture of about 12 different wholegrains to the rice, so instead of just white rice (although I love white rice) it’s a mixture of white rice, brown rice, amaranth, sorghum, buckwheat, barley, black beans, azuki and various other things. That gives the rice a great taste and aroma, and also more protein and fibre. In my family (and many Asian families) rice is the centre of just about every meal, which is ironic considering my wife and I often don’t eat it in the evenings. Our children do, however. If nobody is having rice the meal somehow feels incomplete. I was filming Destination Flavour China a few years ago and I had a rare day off so I went out exploring. I’d wandered around for a few hours when I came across a tiny tea shop in the back streets of a residential area. I’m a bit of a tea nerd, so I went in and had a few cups with the owner. We chatted and, as well as tea, he also sold tea antiques. He showed me this unspeakably beautiful Qing dynasty silver tea tray and I immediately fell in love. Chinese tea trays are like little tables: you can put teacups and teapots on top, and they have perforations so that when you pour the hot water over the surface, it drains into a reservoir below. This one was about the size of a large shoe box but made of solid silver, covered with beautiful engravings of dragons and flowers. After a bit of haggling I agreed to buy it. In truth the haggling was half-hearted, because from the moment I saw it I knew I wanted it. It wasn’t cheap, but it was the kind of item you rarely – if ever – find outside China, and when you do the prices are exorbitant. It was more money than I had with me and I couldn’t use a credit card, so I left the shop and spent a couple of hours trying to rustle up enough cash from ATMs and money changers to buy it. I finally scraped just enough together, but in doing so I’d turned myself all around. When I went back to where I thought the shop was, it just wasn’t there. High-density residential areas in China are often hundreds of rows of identical apartment buildings, and I spent hours trying to find the shop but just kept going around in circles. The crew and I drove out of town the next morning, and to this day every time I have tea from my wooden tea table at home, I think about the one I didn’t lose but couldn’t find.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Adam Liaw: ‘We wake up to freshly cooked rice at 6am’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/16/three-things-with-adam-liaw-we-wake-up-to-freshly-cooked-rice-at-6am
3/16/2022,"Voters in the US are not convinced the Indo-Pacific should be a priority region for the Biden administration, and isolationist sentiment in the country continues to rise, according to a new analysis by the United States Studies Centre. The new USSC State of the United States report, to be launched in Canberra at an event on Wednesday with the defence minister, Peter Dutton, Labor frontbenchers Penny Wong and Brendan O’Connor, and US congressman Joe Courtney, finds support for the US alliance with Canberra remains strong. But the USSC’s chief executive, Prof Simon Jackman, says the US in 2022 is “consumed by a fractious debate about its role in the world, and is almost paralysed by disunity”. The new analysis draws on YouGov polling undertaken in the US and Australia last December. The US sample size was 1,200 and the Australian sample size was 1,211. The data shows isolationist beliefs in the US have increased steadily from 28% of respondents in 2019 to 40% at the end of 2021. The new report also notes that prior to 2016, the American National Election Studies – a time series dating back to 1952 – has never found more than 30% of Americans holding isolationist beliefs. While Joe Biden has stressed the importance of nurturing alliances since winning the White House, voters in the US appear more ambivalent. The largest group of respondents – around half or more – felt alliances made the US neither more nor less secure. This suggests, the report says, “the majority of Americans are unsure about the value of US alliances”. As well as growing isolationism, there is also pervasive pessimism. Voters in both the US and Australia also believe America’s best days are behind them (60% of respondents in the US and 70% in Australia). The research suggests people who voted for Biden in 2020 “are now just as pessimistic about the future of the United States as they were during the Trump administration, while the Republicans’ preferred candidate for the 2024 presidential election remains Donald Trump”. Jackman says the analysis suggests the US currently lacks the national unity that leaders of Australia’s defence and diplomatic establishment view as the critical ingredients of our national defence. “The implication for Australia is clear,” Jackman said. “While the US alliance remains Australia’s single most valuable strategic asset, Australia must continue to rapidly evolve its own capabilities, resilience and autonomy.” Jackman said realising the potential of the Aukus partnership would “require unrelenting focus and attention in Washington, cutting through domestic political division, bureaucratic inertia, vested interests and the many competing demands for the US attention and focus”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The USSC analysis suggests people in the US are hesitant about sharing technology, like nuclear submarine capability, with allies, including Australia (35% of respondents said it was acceptable to share with Australia). The new analysis does show there is bipartisan consensus in the US that China is a major problem. New research from another leading Australian foreign policy thinktank, the Lowy Institute, to be released on Wednesday, looks at China’s future growth trajectory. A paper co-authored by Lowy’s lead economist, Roland Rajah, says China will likely experience a substantial long-term growth slowdown owing to demographic decline, the limits of capital-intensive growth, and a gradual deceleration in productivity growth. Rajah suggests annual economic growth in China will slow to about 3% by 2030 and 2% by 2040, while averaging 2–3% overall from now until 2050. The country remains on track to be the world’s largest economy, “but it would never enjoy a meaningful lead over the US and would remain far less prosperous and productive per person even by mid-century”.",News/Australia news,"Rising US isolationism means Australia must become more resilient and autonomous, thinktank warns",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/rising-us-isolationism-means-australia-must-become-more-resilient-and-autonomous-thinktank-warns
3/16/2022,"Getting Covid wasn’t the way I intended to spend my first few weeks of being 32, but like many other Australians battling the Omicron wave, earlier this year I was stuck on the couch mired in lethargy for weeks. Unable to concentrate on anything new, I was delighted to find all six seasons of Lena Dunham’s Girls available to stream. Like the show’s protagonists, I was 22 and fresh out of university when it came out to acclaim in 2012 – and watched in real time as that acclaim turned to backlash. Heralded as the millennial answer to Sex and the City, critics were irked by Dunham’s candid style, the awkward and in-your-face sex scenes, and the unlikability of the four main characters. The show also had its blind spots when it came to representation. In many ways, Hannah (played by Dunham), Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna were not unlike my own friends. We were also working out what our careers would look like, compromising on the men and women we dated, and coming to the crushing realisation that our ambitions were unlikely to eventuate with the grandiosity we had dreamed of. Still, I felt a level of distaste for the chaos and self-indulgence of the eponymous girls. Twenty-two-year-old me loved hate-watching it while claiming some level of intellectual superiority over the way it depicted my generation of women. Fast-forward 10 years, and rewatching the series I don’t feel the irritation and condescension that I would have expected to solidify with time. Instead, I feel a nostalgic affection for the leads and a startling sense of admiration for the true hero of the series: Ray. I’m aware I’m choosing to centre one of the few male characters in a TV series literally named Girls – but I do have my reasons. On first viewing, Ray – played by Alex Karpovsky – was a distasteful interjection into the quirky, alcohol-infused, social media-fuelled millennial dreamscape of the series. Thirty-three, grumpy and with a penchant for long soliloquies about all the ways in which the world is broken, Ray seemed to mostly be there to contrast the youthful abandon of Hannah and her friends’ 20s, haunting them like a spectre of their depressing 30s to come. But with the benefit of age and perspective, Ray really shines through as a down-to-earth giver of pragmatic advice, who uses his gruff exterior to mask a genuine depth of caring for his friends. Across six seasons (spoiler alert but come on it’s been 10 years), Ray proffers meaningful advice to Marni amid her directionless ennui (“I’m old enough to recognise that all this bullshit comes from a deep dark well of insecurity,” he says – advice that seems relevant to most existential crises); he shows genuine love and care for ex-girlfriend Shoshanna as she grapples with what life after uni even is; and he portrays a depth of grief at the loss of his father figure and employer in season six, which contrasts starkly with the random chaos of the other characters, who seem incapable of a real feeling towards anyone other than themselves. Ray isn’t without his faults, obviously. He reads Hannah’s diary without her permission; he is rude and aggressive a lot of the time; he is prone to fits of yelling at strangers. But lurking beneath his frustrated masculinity is a glimpse of something tender and real. There’s a lot that Girls got wrong. There was very little meaningful diversity, interrogation of class or race, a dose of fat-shaming and a reinforcement of some fairly icky sexuality and gender norms. But Ray Ploshansky? Ray speaks to my 32-year-old cynical heart, and I’m here for it.",Arts/Culture,"Rewatching Girls, an unlikely character shines through: the grumpy 33-year-old man",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/16/rewatching-girls-an-unlikely-character-shines-through-the-grumpy-33-year-old-man
3/16/2022,"Queensland will have a shortage of more than 1,700 high school teachers within three years, according to federal government modelling which depicts a severe national shortfall in the number of secondary educators. Documents obtained by Guardian Australia predict Queensland and New South Wales will bear the brunt of that shortfall, with each needing more than 1,700 teachers by 2025. Teachers and union representatives warned they were facing what one described as the “perfect storm” of booming enrolments, an ageing workforce and a mismatch in the type of educators required compared to those coming out of university. Even as most states and territories were expected to not have enough secondary teachers, a glut of more than 8,000 primary school teachers was predicted across Australia by 2025. The modelling – completed by the federal department of education and circulated to state and territory education ministers – shows a 25% decline in Queensland’s high school teaching graduates over a five-year period to 2025. Secondary school enrolments are forecast to rise by 13% in the same period. But a spokesperson for Queensland education minister, Grace Grace, disputed the predictions. The spokesperson said the Queensland government statistician’s office figures show enrolments across state schools will increase 4.4% between 2021 and 2026. Modelling by the state government was also said to show there will be enough teachers to meet enrolment growth. “We made a commitment at the last election to employ 6,190 new teachers and 1,139 new teacher aides over the next four years, and we are on track to meet that commitment,” Grace said. “This is in addition to the more than 6,000 new teachers we have employed since 2015, as well as more than 1,500 new teacher aides.” Teachers at public and private schools across Queensland – who wished not to be named as they were not authorised to speak about their work – said they were buckling under increasing workloads. One department head at a large state school in southeast Queensland said he and his staff were “totally overworked”. The teacher has almost two decades experience, and said he was now “struggling to get through every day”. “Teachers are wanting to walk away in droves,” he said. “They are totally over it.” He said his roughly 10 teachers were struggling with stress and anxiety, swamped under an “immense workload” that was oriented towards “business goals” not “student outcomes”. “I have young teachers telling me they want to retrain now,” he said. An English teacher at an all-girls school in Brisbane said pressure on teachers was increasing in the private system as well. “Very recently, two colleagues of mine have taken stress leave and I’ve not seen that before” she said. “Both were burned out, had health scares and needed to take time off.” A study released by the federal government’s Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership in December found a quarter of teachers said they intended to leave the profession before they retired, and more than half of those planned to leave within the next decade. It found one in three teachers aged under 30 intended to leave over the coming 10 years. Queensland Teachers Union president Cresta Richardson said regional schools do “whatever it takes” to ensure continuity of education for their students. “That is what you do in a school, you get together to ensure the best outcome for your kids,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But that meant administrators would have to add teaching to their daily workload and somehow “catch up on things that have accumulated throughout the day”. In the 12 months to last June, more than 30,000 people moved to Queensland from interstate – almost the equivalent to adding a city the size of Gladstone in a year. “The state government is doing a good job of building schools in the metro growth corridors, but they need to focus on encouraging teachers to outback and more rural areas,” Richardson said. As well as reducing workloads, teachers say increasing pay and locality allowances would help make the career more desirable. In all, more than 4,000 extra high school teachers nationwide are needed over the next four years to meet demand, according to federal government modelling. South Australia is projected to fall more than 1,100 high school teachers short of its needs in 2025, Western Australia will have a dearth of 900 and the Northern Territory be short more than 100 high school teachers. Victoria was forecast to have a surplus of almost 1,000 teachers, Tasmania about 200 more than needed and the ACT was forecast to roughly match its high school teaching requirements. The Department of Education said the acting federal education minister, Stuart Robert, had “led discussions at education ministers meetings to better understand teacher workforce issues across the country”. The Queensland education minister said the Palaszczuk government was “always keen to recruit more of the brightest minds to educate our youngest Queenslanders – particularly to remote and regional areas”. “That’s why we offer incentives including relocation assistance, subsidised housing, and one of the highest graduate starting salaries in the country,” Grace said.",News/Australia news,"Queensland to have one of nation’s worst teacher shortages, modelling suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/queensland-to-have-one-of-nations-worst-teacher-shortages-modelling-suggests
3/16/2022,"It wasn’t until Jess Woolhouse was alone in the water, after pulling a bleeding shark attack victim to safety, that the fear finally took hold. Until that moment, the father of three had been acting purely on instinct when he paddled towards a five-metre great white shark and helped rip Phil Mummert from danger at a surf break at Bunker Bay, 260km south of Perth. More than 50m from shore and with the shark circling below, Woolhouse and fellow surfers Father Liam Ryan and Alex Oliver pulled 28-year-old Mummert on to a longboard and paddled hard for shore. “Liam and Alex held on to him from the sides, and I was at the rear … finally a wave came and I pushed from the back of the board and so they made it in [to shore],” Woolhouse said. “I looked up and everyone was in, the last couple of people were scrambling up the shore and I hadn’t caught a wave in, it was at the point that the dread sunk in. “I genuinely was like ‘Oh great, I’m the last one out here and this thing is obviously hungry’, and it is the first time the reality of it all sunk in. It was crazy.” The surfers’ heroic actions on that sunny winter’s day in July 2020 have earned them one of the nation’s top bravery awards. Woolhouse, Ryan and Oliver are three of 15 people being recognised with Australian Bravery Decorations by the governor general, David Hurley, for acting selflessly and putting themselves in jeopardy to protect the lives or property of others. “No one sets out to be brave. No one really knows how, when presented with a dangerous situation, they will act. The men and women that we are celebrating today acted bravely,” Hurley said on Tuesday. “Each found themselves in a perilous situation. There was a threat. They or fellow citizens were in danger and, in that instant, they chose to help.” Among the other recipients honoured on Tuesday were two navy officers who ran into a burning building to try to save an elderly man at Greenwell Point in New South Wales and a truck driver who, covered in fuel, rescued several people from a petrol tanker accident in Melbourne. Russell Irwin tried to stop an armed home invasion in Cranbourne North and Gyles Deacon was honoured for rescuing a fisherman swept from rocks at Wombarra in NSW. Mummert says he has no doubt he would be dead if the trio hadn’t paddled over to help him. “The shark came from behind and to the side of me and got me from there, so I didn’t see it before it bit me,” he recalls. He said he came face to face with the shark as he floated in the water with half a board strapped to his leg. Mummert says he knew the shark had bitten his board in half, but he didn’t realise it had also taken a chunk from his buttocks to his knee. In the fight of his life, injured Mummert says he slammed what was left of his board into the shark’s face and mouth and tried to kick it away as it circled and charged at him multiple times. “I really remember quite vividly trying to push it away in the side and I just remember it felt like I was pushing a brick wall and its skin was really rough,” Mummert said. “It was so solid, I remember as I pushed it, it didn’t move – it just moved me backward and I knew that what I was doing wasn’t working.” This is not the first shark attack at Bunker Bay. In 2011, 21-year-old bodyboarder Kyle James Burden was bitten in half and killed instantly by a great white shark. Mummert says when he saw the other surfers coming toward him, he thought “What are you doing? Go and save yourselves.” “I was doing my best to fight it off on my own but there is only so long you can do that for, it would have got me eventually and as far as I’m concerned the only reason the shark disappeared in the end was because those three came over.” After almost two years recovering from the attack, Mummert says he has finally turned a corner and can go surfing again, despite residual nerve pain in his leg. Exactly a year after the attack, Ryan and Woolhouse say they went back to the Bunker Bay break, called The Farm, and surfed it again. They plan to make the pilgrimage each year. Ryan, Woolhouse and Oliver were strangers to Mummert before that fateful day, but despite living three hours from each other, they keep in touch. Woolhouse says although the trio have also received a gold medallion for exceptional bravery by Surf Life Saving WA, he doesn’t feel like a hero. “I would say I just feel lucky – lucky I was the right guy in the situation at the right time and I was able to get away scot-free,” Woolhouse says. “These awards really mean a lot to me because without sounding like an absolute bogan, I really am a proud Australian.”",News/Australia news,‘No one sets out to be brave’: WA surfers who rescued shark attack victim win top bravery award,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/no-one-sets-out-to-be-brave-wa-surfers-who-rescued-shark-attack-victim-win-top-bravery-award
3/16/2022,"We’ve all seen the setup in the movies. The gates open slowly, a recently released prisoner walks out, looking dazed. They stare at the sky, breathe in the air, say “so long suckers” and walk down the road to freedom and their future. But what happens after that? For prisoners without a home or family to go back to life outside can be a lot more precarious and unstable than life on the inside. One new solution to the lack of suitable accommodation for recently released prisoners is to place them for a few months in a house with a private citizen, while they readjust to life on the outside. That’s the setup in the new SBS three-part documentary Life on the Outside, an Australia-first experiment that was inspired by a fully operational initiative in the US. On the show, prisoners are housed with individuals and families in their homes as they spend the first 100 days getting back on their feet. The hope is that with recidivism rates so high (one in two Australian prisoners return to jail within the first two years of being released), the program will provide a more gentle landing for the newly released. A chaotic start to life on the outside can set people up for failure and reoffending. The film-makers of Life on the Outside have obtained intimate access to both the former prisoners and their hosts – filming inside homes and capturing the tension and awkwardness as all parties settle in. There are tensions. The hosts have good intentions – but what are their limits? The prisoners have sometimes spent decades inside – how will they adapt to living in a stranger’s suburban home? At first it’s weird for everyone. Do you hug or handshake hello? Do you impose rules or let guests come and go as they please? Can their friends visit? Danielle Cormack, the show’s host and Wentworth actor, says: “It’s not the perfect solution, but it’s an approach that can inspire conversation and debate around people who are clearly struggling. With the right strategies you can really help another human being thrive. “I hope this show becomes a conversation starter for a lot of people to start challenging the system and the policies around the correction system. It costs $110,000 per year to house an inmate, and the recidivism rate is shockingly high.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning While the show touches on politics and policy, it’s the human stories that dominate. There’s Amanda, an empty-nester who agrees to house Sierra, a 41-year-old mother of two who has spent the past 13 months in custody. Nigel, a teacher, agrees to house Dane, a 24-year-old Bundjalung man and father of three, who was in prison for 10 months. And husband and wife hosts Wayne and Julie take in Brett, a serial offender who has been to prison four times. But my favourite pairing was Louise and her two adult children, Brittany and Reggie, who open their home to Jeremy, a 41-year-old who has spent nearly half his life inside and has been to prison 14 times. Louise and her family are models of kindness and non-judgment, while Jeremy is determined to start afresh. Viewers will ask themselves the question: could I open my home to a former prisoner? Although not all the arrangements work out in the series, the open-heartedness of the hosts and the former inmates’ resilience and willingness to adapt is incredibly inspiring and moving. The magnitude of the struggle facing those leaving incarceration is also revealed in interviews with former inmates, who share their perspective on the challenges they faced on the outside. One is Eleni Psillakis, who spent 11 months inside and says prisoners face a whole new set of challenges once they are released. “Former inmates don’t know of the services available to them,” she says. “They are also made to jump through so many hoops to sort out their Centrelink. They have to keep a housing diary, there are mutual obligations with Centrelink, they might not have ID. I have many women saying that this is too hard, jail is easier.” Now Psillakis helps other recently released inmates as the program manager at Dress for Success Sydney, which helps unemployed women with professional clothing and life skills needed to obtain employment. Former inmates face substantial discrimination when looking for work, she says: “If the offence has nothing to do with the role, then what’s the problem? Most of the time we get a great response from employers because we tell them our story.” Another former inmate on the show is Joe Kwon, a personal trainer and the founder and CEO of ConFit Pathways, a not-for-profit that aims to help tackle recidivism among young people. Kwon “went in when I was 21 and came out when I was 30”. When he was released, he didn’t have anywhere to stay and didn’t want to couch surf. “Most of my friends got married in the time I’d been inside and I hadn’t met their spouses,” he says. “Imagine saying, ‘Hey, my friend’s been in jail for a decade – do you mind if he stays?’” He managed to find a room in a share house in Lidcombe. “I didn’t have any money – it was an old dilapidated house and they were going to knock it down. I had cold showers, there were holes in the floorboard – but at the end of the day it’s better than jail,” he says. Kwon is really excited about the initiative tried in Life on the Outside, because of its potential to drive systemic reform. “It’s a make or break for anyone that doesn’t have the support on the outside,” he says. “[It] can be the difference between whether they make a life for themselves, or go back inside.” Life on the Outside starts Wednesday night on SBS",Arts/Television & radio,‘It’s make or break’: would you open your home to help a former prisoner?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/16/its-make-or-break-would-you-open-your-home-to-help-a-former-prisoner
3/16/2022,"Environmentalists once saw abstraction as the biggest obstacle to climate action. How, they wondered, could one focus the public on the distant future? Today, we confront the opposite problem, with the very immediacy of the crisis generating a strange paralysis. When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that global heating made extreme flooding more common, its new report at the end of February spurred relatively little discussion – in part because of the water covering swathes of Queensland and New South Wales. As tinnies plucked desperate residents from the deluge, who could give due weight to the warning from Prof Brendan Mackey, one of the IPPC authors, that the science clearly projected “an increase of heavy rainfall events?” The urgency of rescuing flood victims muffled the impact of a document that the UN secretary general, António Guterres, described as “an atlas of human suffering”. It also diverted attention from a previous manifestation of that suffering: the 2019/2020 Black Summer fires that burned out 84m acres of land and killed at least 33 people. That crisis remains far from resolved, with more than half of the $2.74bn pledged by the Morrison government to bushfire recovery still unallocated. Yet, as the scale of recent flood damage becomes more apparent, the Black Summer survivors might legitimately wonder as to whether they’ll be remembered or not. On Twitter, the chief executive of Greenpeace, David Ritter, has compiled a helpful list of scientific warnings connecting fossil fuels, atmospheric warmth and rainfall. In 2007, for instance, the Garnaut climate change review predicted “longer dry spells broken by heavier rainfall events”; in 2015, scientists found that global warming increased the frequency of La Niña events; in 2016, the Department of Energy and the Environment published a State of the Climate report which warned of more intense floods. A comparable dossier might be assembled about bushfires, beginning with the 2003 report that explained how “climate change throughout the present century is predicted to lead to increased temperatures and, with them, a heightened risk of unplanned fire.” In 2007, the IPCC warned that “heatwaves and fires are virtually certain to increase in intensity and frequency”; in 2008, the National Inquiry on Bushfire Mitigation and Management explained that “fires’ frequency, intensity, and size are expected to increase under climate change”. But despite all of that, in 2017, Scott Morrison chose to borrow a “prop” from his friends at the Minerals Council of Australia to wave in the House of Representatives. “This is coal,” he laughed. “Don’t be afraid, don’t be scared. It won’t hurt you!” A few years later, the same Scott Morrison stood in a ruined Lismore and mused: “Australia is getting hard to live in because of these disasters.” With the right climate policy we might have transitioned away from fossil fuels under conditions of relative stability. Instead, we’ve allowed the symptoms of ecological breakdown to proliferate so greatly as to render addressing underlying causes increasingly difficult. “I’ve never seen so many natural disasters …” said the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. “[M]ore cyclones, more floods, a couple of year ago … we had the catastrophic fire event in central Queensland.” But even as Palaszczuk acknowledged the role of the climate crisis in the recent catastrophes, she doubled down on her state’s output of fossil fuels. “Queensland is lucky,” she said. “We have coal, we have gas, and we have huge renewable investment, which is going to really rapidly increase over the next 10 years.” One presumes that, with a multibillion-dollar flood bill looming and many of its citizens homeless, the state doesn’t want to forgo the mining revenue on which it has traditionally relied. What an illustration of the mess in which we find ourselves – reliant on coal to pay for the damage coal brings! In a different context, the sociologist C Wright Mills outlined what he called “crackpot realism”, a political consensus perfectly reasonable on its own terms but utterly deranged from the perspective of the species. Most scientists attribute the proliferation of pandemics to environmental degradation: deforestation and uncontrolled urbanisation increase the likelihood of pathogens crossing over from animals to humans. So, logically, Covid-19 should have spurred a ceasefire in the war on nature. But that’s not what happened. Carbon emissions have now rebounded to their highest level in human history, as, in response to the Covid downturn, politicians relied on coal to reboot their economies. The same “crackpot realism” manifests in relation to Ukraine. As the British academic Helen Thompson notes, it’s been obvious for decades that “addressing climate change would be constrained by geopolitics, and that choices about which new energy sources to develop would have geopolitical consequences.” The west’s refusal to quit fossil fuels thus facilitated Russia’s imperial ambitions. Paradoxically, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has now emboldened those most committed to further pollution. The Nationals’ Matt Canavan, for instance, say that the war means Australians should “stop trying to save the planet by building a green economy, and instead defend Australia by rebuilding our industrial base.” If we once hoped that real-world manifestations of the climate emergency would, in and of themselves, force world leaders to change, we should quit kidding ourselves. It’s now clear the reverse holds true: that each fresh environmental calamity sends the wealthy and the powerful, like dogs returning to their vomit, to the cheap profits of the carbon economy. As disaster chases disaster, we need to hold our leaders’ feet to the flames – and, for that matter, to the water. That means drawing the links between global heating and the proliferation of “one-in-1000-year” occurrences and insisting on climate action, even (or perhaps especially) amid economic and political uncertainty. Yes, the “crackpot realists” of the political class will scoff. They’ll say we’re naive and dismiss us as utopians. Mills had a response to such people. “[P]recisely what they call utopian,” he said, “is now the condition of human survival”.",Opinion/Opinion,Is battling back-to-back disasters distracting us from fighting the climate crisis? | Jeff Sparrow,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/15/is-battling-back-to-back-disasters-distracting-us-from-fighting-the-climate-crisis
3/16/2022,"Australian choreographer Lucy Guerin has just landed in Melbourne from Aix-en-Provence, where she has been working on a show involving young dancers, all aged between 11 and 18. “It opens in November,” she says. “I’m going back there once more because we have to rehearse during the school holidays.” In the meantime, she’s in Australia to premiere a new show, Flux Job, at North Melbourne’s Arts House. That eclecticism, not to mention her global reach, is typical of an artist who has always had one foot in the international scene – both for artistic reasons and practical necessity. “There aren’t a lot of touring options in Australia. If you spend a lot of time and money making a work, you want people to see it,” she says. It will be 20 years in September since Guerin launched the company that bears her name, Lucy Guerin Inc. While she is not prone to retrospection, she has started looking back at past work in preparation for another show she’s planning. “I don’t tend to get out the old videos, but I’ve been returning to some of the movement concerns I had when I was younger,” she says. It is an extraordinary body of work, including shows such as Structure and Sadness, which used symbol and abstraction to explore the 1970 collapse of the West Gate Bridge; or Human Interest Story, which blended spoken word and dance to investigate the impact of news cycles on our psyches. Or the gloriously monochrome Motion Picture, which saw the 1950 noir film DOA projected on to the dancers. Born in Adelaide, Guerin “really began my choreographic life in New York”, a city she lived in for seven years. She initially trained as a ballet dancer, which surprise those familiar with her work, eschewing as it does the emotive pull of ballet for something more sparse and cerebral. “I never became a ballet dancer, but the idea of repetition, those sequence of movements that you do in class every day, finding out more and more about the same movement, gave me a sense of inquiry, of going deeper into things,” she explains. Ballet isn’t the only influence that has stayed with Guerin since those early days; she became interested in “release techniques”, which she describes as “much more about the way the body is structured anatomically”. With its emphasis on the natural inclinations of human movement, on the principals of fluidity and ease, release techniques have widely influenced contemporary dance. “There’s a funny thing that happens when you’ve been a dancer for a long time and you move into choreography,” Guerin says. “You try to create movement and you really feel inhabited – it’s like being possessed – by a lot of different ghosts. It feels like all the movement styles you’ve ever learned just start coming out.” But over time, the anxiety of influence wanes. “Now, it’s the opposite. I’m almost more influenced by younger generations of choreographers, or just curious about what is coming up,” she says. It is this curiosity, this need to “let the flow of ideas wash over you, just to stay connected with what’s going on”, that has ensured Guerin’s reputation as an innovator remains as strong now as when she first burst on to the scene. “Dance is a social and collaborative form, so I’m always being inspired and in communication with the dancers – and with my collaborators, composers, designers, costume designers – when I’m making new work.” Her new show, Flux Job, wasn’t intended to reflect the lives of dancers over the past two years of isolation, but it bled into the work, perhaps inevitably. “It always began with four individual dancers inhabiting their own worlds. And because it’s been postponed and rescheduled over almost two years it just became about separation,” she says. Two central ideas solidified for Guerin as she was developing Flux Job: space and time. “Space has become such a topic of concern, and proximity is charged now with danger,” she says. “Everyone is very conscious of space, which is one of the fundamental and essential elements of choreography. I almost couldn’t help but incorporate that into the work.” And similarly, the malleability of time during lockdowns; for Guerin, “There’d be days when it would seem to just disappear and get stalled up, and then others when it just expanded.” Guerin has been lumbered with the postmodern tag almost from the beginning of her career. While she doesn’t care to categorise her work – “I just feel it’s impossible to label yourself; that’s the job of others, really” – she can see why her style encourages the term. Postmodernism has a particular meaning in dance that is distinct from other fields, like art or literature; it describes work that is often nonlinear and anti-narrative, rejecting dramatic arcs and emotive gestures. Any suggestion of climax or catharsis is almost viewed as suspicious, as being too easy or cheap a way to communicate meaning with audiences. “I don’t enjoy going to shows where I can feel myself being pushed and manipulated into certain emotional states,” Guerin says. “I love seeing things that are more abstract, which leave a lot of space for me to have my own thoughts, where I can almost participate in the work, rather than having it imposed upon me.” This could almost read as Guerin’s manifesto. Her ascetic and highly disciplined approach to the art form is why audience reactions to her work can vary so dramatically, why there seems such a vast array of interpretive possibilities available to us. Even Guerin finds herself shocked sometimes: “I can never tell what the audience reaction will be.” She remembers the reaction to her 2009 show Untrained as particularly disconcerting. The show saw two professional and two amateur dancers responding to specific instructions; the gap between the two pairs became a kind of competition between awkward naturalism and polished competence. “People found it really funny – I was sitting in the audience mortified. I thought ‘Oh my god, this is terrible, they’re laughing at the work!’” Guerin says. “But in the end that laughter was really supportive and I got used to it.” With such a rich back catalogue of works, are there any that Guerin feels are central to her legacy? “Sometimes you’re working with an idea and it might take a few works to really nail it, but there’s lots of them I quite like,” she says. She mentions Split, an ingenious work that involved two dancers bifurcating the stage with duct tape, then abandoning one half of the playing space, until they’re left with a square too small to do anything in but stand. And Conversation Piece, which recorded live improvised speech and looped it in increasingly bizarre and complex ways, exploring the nexus between the spoken and the gestural. “I’ve always had this interest, or confoundedness, about the relationship between language and movement,” she says. “I’ve tried in many works to figure it out, not always successfully. In Conversation Piece, I found a meaningful connection between those two things.”She has returned to that interest in Flux Job, which blends text and movement, this time in collaboration with the brilliant theatre director Adena Jacobs. And having dancers speak on stage – not their usual job – links back to Untrained and the line between professionalism and competency. It seems that, no matter how far Guerin goes as a choreographer, her interests and ideas loop back on themselves, scratching at a sequence of movements to find the layers underneath. That discipline, the sense of inquiry she learned in ballet class all those years ago, has deepened with time. “I suppose that’s what I’m looking for,” she says. “Something that’s distilled and pared back – yet really compelling.” Flux Job by Lucy Guerin Inc runs at Arts House, North Melbourne Town Hall, 16–20 March",Arts/Stage,‘It’s like being possessed’: Australia’s star choreographer Lucy Guerin on 20 years of dance,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/16/its-like-being-possessed-australias-star-choreographer-lucy-guerin-on-20-years-of-dance
3/16/2022,"New South Wales is facing a severe secondary teacher shortage, with unreleased federal government modelling suggesting the state will be short-staffed by 1,700 educators within three years. Documents obtained by the Guardian show more than 4,000 extra high school teachers are needed nationally over the next four years, with the biggest shortfalls predicted in New South Wales and Queensland. A separate internal NSW Department of Education briefing shows the state-wide shortage is expected to be most severe in science and technology subjects, in rural, regional and remote schools, and in lower socio-economic areas. The national forecast said the secondary teacher shortage would jump above 9,000 across Australia if schools only relied on domestic – and no international – students. While most states and territories are expected to have a shortage of secondary teachers, a glut of more than 8,000 primary school teachers is predicted across the country within four years. The federal government also expects more than 50,000 teachers to permanently leave the profession between 2020 and 2025, including almost 5,000 teachers aged between 25 and 29. The NSW Teachers Federation head, Angelo Gavrielatos, described the situation as a “perfect storm that cannot be denied any longer”. “The sooner all governments stop the denial, the better we will be,” he said. “The cause is uncompetitive salaries and unsustainable workloads. If you know the cause, you know the solution. Fix it.” The workforce modelling was completed by the federal Department of Education and circulated to state and territory education ministers to be discussed at an upcoming meeting. It was sent in draft form to the NSW state government and obtained by the Guardian. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The federal Department of Education said the acting education minister, Stuart Robert, has been leading the conversations with ministers “to better understand teacher workforce issues” nationally – a task usually left up to the states. “These discussions have resulted in the department undertaking modelling of teacher demand and supply, which has been tested with jurisdictions and the non-government schools sector,” a spokesperson for the department said. The NSW education department documents show one in five students in regional parts of the state are now being taught maths by a non-specialist teacher, while 70,000 students could be affected by shortages by 2030. Briefings provided to the NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, in 2021 warned the department needed to find an additional 4,100 teachers this year, with severe shortages in some regions. While the state could meet teacher shortages “at an aggregate level”, a shortfall of 800 Stem-qualified teachers meant that about 40,000 students were being taught by “out-of-field” teachers in 2022. In total, the department warned, one in eight secondary students across the state would be taught by “out-of-field” teachers in 2022. The predicted shortfalls come amid rising concern over the longevity of teachers across the sector, with many reporting feeling overworked even before the pandemic. A study released by a federal government body in December found a quarter of teachers said they intended to leave the profession before they retired and more than half of those planned to leave within the next decade. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) research found one in three teachers under 30 – and almost 40% of teachers aged between 30 and 39 – intended to leave the profession in the next decade. Low pay, heavy workload, stress and an inability to control the student population were among the top reasons given for planning to leave. The briefings to the education minister warned the shortage was particularly acute in regional parts of the state, where out-of-field teaching is as high as one-in-five. “Stem-qualified teacher shortages could affect as many as 70,000 students each year by 2030,” the briefings warned. “The situation is particularly acute in rural and regional areas, where out-of-field maths teaching is currently as high as 22%.” The shortfall of teachers in NSW has been well documented. In January Guardian Australia revealed 70 public schools across the state had staff vacancy rates of 20% or higher, while there were 3,300 vacant teaching positions across the state in October last year. Last year the government announced a new Teacher Supply Strategy to provide 3,700 extra teachers over the next decade. The strategy aims to address shortages in the profession by recruiting teachers from interstate, improving perceptions of teaching by funding a marketing campaign and accelerating the careers of high-performing teachers. In a statement, the state education department said the government was “on track” to meet its 2019 target of an additional 4,600 teachers over four years. “The department acknowledges the specific challenges facing specific subject areas in certain locations across the state, and is implementing a range of targeted scholarships and incentives to attract Stem teachers where they are needed most,” a spokesperson for the department said. But the strategy has been criticised by the NSW Teachers Federation for failing to address teacher pay. Since 2011, the NSW government has capped wage increases for public servants at 2.5%, a measure that has prompted increased hostility from unions who say pay has not kept pace with rising cost-of-living pressures across the state. In the briefings obtained by the Guardian, the department provided talking points to the minister on a number of questions relating to teacher pay, including: “NSW teachers are among the lowest paid in Australia. Why is this the case?” and “Teachers play such a critical role which isn’t reflected in their pay. The profession is undervalued – why can’t the government just lift the cap?”. The briefings blame the shortfall on a lack of qualified teachers in particular subject areas (such as Stem), the difficulty of providing staff to schools in regional or remote parts of the state and what it described as an “increasing” difficulty in finding casual staff to plug holes. On the latter, the department warned shortages of casual teachers had been exacerbated by their use as part of the Covid Intensive Learning Program, a $383m program placing extra teaching staff in classes to help address education shortfalls resulting from the pandemic. It also cites “higher sick leave” among casuals. But the minister defended teacher paying, saying public school teacher salaries were “competitive with those offered by other state education systems”. “In 2011 the annual salary for teachers at the top of the salary scale was $84,759,” her spokesperson said. “In 2022 the band 2.3 annual salary is $109,978. Over the last 11 years the classroom teacher salary at the top of the scale has increased by $25,219 which represents a 29.75% increase from the 2011 salary.”",News/Australia news,Government projections forecast shortfall of 1700 secondary teachers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/a-perfect-storm-government-forecasts-shortfall-of-1700-teachers-in-nsw
3/16/2022,"Australia should abandon skills shortage lists and labour market testing in favour of granting temporary visas for all jobs earning more than $70,000, the Grattan Institute has argued. Australia’s temporary migration system is delivering the “worst of both worlds”, with employers bringing fewer high-skilled workers in while those earning as little as $53,900 are vulnerable to exploitation, the thinktank argues in a report released on Tuesday. The Turnbull government overhauled the temporary skilled visa system in 2017, dividing jobs with skills shortages into streams that granted two- or four-year stays. Critics said the move severed the pathway to permanent residency and citizenship for some in a bid to boost Australian jobs. Temporary migration remains unpopular in Australia, with Labor and unions complaining pre-pandemic that more than one million temporary visa-holders have work rights, contributing to lower wages in Australia. The Grattan report, by Brendan Coates, Henry Sherrell and Will Mackey, said that use of temporary skills shortage visas had become “more costly and less certain”. Workers on the visa declined from 110,000 in 2014 after the mining boom to just 60,000 in 2021, accounting for one in every 200 workers in the workforce. Instead, industries such as aged care reliant on overseas-born workers tend to employ permanent residents, New Zealanders and international students. The report noted that more than half of those on the temporary skilled visa now earn less than the typical full-time Australian worker, a problem exacerbated by the fact the low-income threshold to access the visa has remained frozen at $53,900 since mid-2013. “Employers are sponsoring a growing number of low-wage workers with few skills,” it said. The report argued it is “practically impossible to quickly and reliably identify skills shortages in individual occupations”. “Instead, temporary sponsorship should be reserved for higher-wage jobs in any occupation. Targeting higher-wage migrants will better address most genuine skills shortages that emerge.” The Grattan Institute called for a new temporary skilled worker visa, granting a right to work in Australia for four years, with no restriction on renewal and a clear pathway to permanent residency. With a threshold of $70,000, some 66% of jobs would be eligible for temporary sponsorship, up from 44%. The report argued that labour-market testing – the requirement to advertise a job in Australia before filling it with a visa-holder – is “superficially appealing” but “unworkable in practice”. It suggested the process had become a “complicated box-ticking exercise” that doesn’t add much to local employment because “no government official can assess whether an employer has made a genuine attempt to hire an Australian worker first”. The report argued workers on the temporary skilled visa are particularly vulnerable to exploitation because the visa is tied to their sponsoring employer and they must leave Australia within 60 days if they stop working for them. It proposed that workers are able to change employers into any job earning above the threshold, with 90 days to remain in Australia to find a new job if they become unemployed. “This would enable migrants to walk away from employers who mistreat them.” The report also called for labour agreements, which permit sponsorship for lower-wage jobs, to be abolished. The Grattan Institute called for a crackdown on bad-faith employers who mistreat their workers, with the home affairs department to conduct more random audits. It also suggested a number of employer-friendly reforms to: replace all upfront costs with a $1,000 nomination fee and ongoing monthly fee based on the number of workers sponsored; and grant accredited employers sponsoring high-wage workers faster five-day visa processing. In August a Liberal-controlled parliamentary committee recommended an overhaul to the skilled migration program to give temporary workers and some international students clearer pathways to permanent residency in Australia. The report also called for a relaxation of labour-market testing requirements, which prompted backlash from Labor which warned this would prevent Australians having the first shot at a job.",News/Australia news,"Australia should grant temporary visas for all jobs earning over $70,000, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/australia-should-grant-temporary-visas-for-all-jobs-earning-over-70000-report-says
3/16/2022,"In North Adelaide, as the street sweepers wind up their morning clean, Peter Malinauskas is fresh from his “hump day” park run around the River Torrens. The 41-year-old Labor leader – who looks as if he has barely broken a sweat – has been inviting locals to join him for a weekly 6am jog as he casts himself as the man “running for the future” at Saturday’s South Australian election. “We invite anyone from South Australia to come for a run and this morning I was joined by a whole bunch of young Libs, so that’s part of the political discourse,” Malinauskas says with an eye-roll.“But I enjoy it. It’s more to clear the head than anything else.” “Mali”, as he is known at his footy club and in political circles, has become the focus of Labor’s election campaign, the fresh face of the party that until 2018 had been in government for 16 years. A golden boy of the Shoppies union for which he was state secretary, Malinauskas made a name for himself in state politics after being one of a small group who tapped Mike Rann in 2011 to inform him his time as premier was up. He was just 30 years old. Commentators are near-united that Malinauskas is peaking at just the right time – poised to do what six months ago was almost unthinkable – ending Steven Marshall’s Liberal government after just one term. Canberra will be watching closely. The state poll is shaping as the first test of incumbency since the arrival of Omicron, a barometer for the federal campaign that will follow in May. Six months ago the state political landscape looked very different. South Australia was locked in the daily news cycle of Covid case numbers, and press conferences fronted by the chief health officer, Nicola Spurrier, (“Saint Nicola” as she became known) and the police commissioner, Grant Stevens, guided every turn. Compared to the eastern states, South Australia remained relatively untouched by the pandemic: it had endured just one six-day lockdown, and had managed to keep a lid on community transmission with light-touch restrictions. Marshall’s Covid team was widely commended for its handling of the Covid crisis, and Malinauskas chose a bipartisan approach. “The judgment that I made early, at the beginning of Covid was that I said I was going to be a constructive opposition leader, and so this was an important opportunity to demonstrate I was serious about it,” Malinauskas says. “So we backed the government all the way, (but) the problem for that for us politically – which is no one else’s problem apart from my own – is that it relegated us to non existence.” Assuring South Australians that the state was ready to reopen, Marshall decided to forge ahead and reopen the border on 23 November. It was the day “to introduce Covid into SA”, said the police commissioner. This, unlike the decisions that came before it, was one squarely owned by the premier. The next day South African health authorities reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization. Quickly overwhelmed by the virus as the border reopened, promised Christmas freedoms didn’t arrive. Just as some families were reunited, others became divided by quarantine and isolation rules. Case numbers exploded and testing sites were stretched. Amid what Malinauskas describes as the ensuing “calamity” over summer, Labor’s message on health policy reform targeting the state’s overwhelmed health system struck a chord. Suddenly, Labor was back in the hunt. In a buzzing cafe in Adelaide’s city centre, perched over coffee, Marshall is adamant the decision to open up in November was the right one. “I stand by that decision 100%,” Marshall says. “That was in line with the best health advice since day one. We’ve listened to the experts, we’ve listened to evidence we haven’t told people to drink bleach, and we’ve actually kept our state safe and at the same time, our economy strong.” “We’ve had the fewest days of lockdown of any jurisdiction in the country, we have had our kids at school and people at work. And yes, it’s been tough. There have been plenty of people that have suffered because of it. They’ve had to make sacrifices but those individual sacrifices, those collective sacrifices are exactly and precisely what’s kept our state safe.” Last Saturday, just a week before the election, most of the state’s restrictions were lifted: singing and dancing were back; the local daily paper, The Advertiser, heralded it was “time to party like it’s 2019”. Marshall is hoping his government will get credit for its pandemic management, and is campaigning on the risk the change back to Labor would pose as the state embarks on recovery. The Liberals released their costings early on Monday to zero in on Labor’s $3bn in new promises, warning that voters will pay more if Malinauskas is successful. The party’s costings for a promised new hydrogen plant have also come under fire, with the Grattan Institute suggesting the price tag to liquefy hydrogen would be “in the low hundreds of millions of dollars”, not $31m as Labor suggests. “This election is about a stronger economy,” Marshall says. “When we came to government, South Australia was considered as a backwater. I think that now South Australia has a spring in its step. I think people are proud to be South Australian. I do not think that existed under 16 years of Labor (when) each and every year we saw a mass exodus of major companies, capital, and most importantly, young people out of South Australia.” “That has been completely reversed in just four years and that’s why we need to have a continuation of a Liberal government to maintain that momentum, to build on that momentum and to create new and exciting opportunities for the next generation.” He points to SA having the fastest growing economy in the nation “for the first time ever”, and record exports and investment that would be threatened by a Labor government “throwing money around like confetti”. Marshall’s problem, however, is people don’t appear to be listening. As much as the Liberals want the election to be about the economy, at a pre-polling booth in Daw Park, in the key marginal seat of Elder, dozens of campaign posters make clear that the big issue at next weekend’s poll is health.Labor has seized on a the perennial problem of ambulances ramping outside major hospitals to pledge to “fix the ramping crisis”, while defensive Liberal campaign material reminds people that Labor made cuts to the health system while it was in office and while Malinauskas was health minister. Labor’s candidate for Elder, Nadia Clancy, is well versed on the ramping statistics as a slow trickle of voters comes into the uniting church hall to cast an early ballot. “Ambulance response times have gone down – they were 85% on time back in 2017 2018 under Labor, for the life threatening ones, and now that response time for the first week of January is 33%. That’s significant. “We want to increase hospital beds, increase nurses, doctors and also ambulance officers and ambulances, because we know that it’s not one thing that you change to fix it.” The Liberal MP, Carolyn Power, known in Adelaide for being targeted by SA Labor for her former surname “Habib”, says the campaign is “just the usual scaremongering tactics”. “The work that we’re doing on health is incredible. We’re upgrading every suburban hospital, Flinders medical centre has almost doubled in capacity, and we are reactivating the Repat (hospital).” “So I think it’s just your usual opposition. They never let the truth get in the way of a good story.” Ramping is a decade-old issue in South Australia, but has worsened in recent years due to complex issues in the health system that lead to “bed block” and patients being treated in “ramping” ambulances waiting for admission. The most recent data from SA Health shows an improvement since October last year when ramping peaked at almost 3000 hours, but January’s figure of 1,522 hours is still more than double the 653 hours waiting to offload patients in 2018. Posters of Malinauskas plastered across Adelaide’s suburbs promise to “fix the ramping crisis”, while a union campaign has posters of Marshall as the face of a cigarette packet “hazardous to your health” warning. The Ambulance Employees Association SA has tapped into the services of advertising guru Dee Madigan, running a stunningly effective campaign that has pitted the state’s paramedics against the government. SA ambulances have for two years being cruising Adelaide’s streets with “chalked” messages of protest on them saying “lives are at risk” under Marshall. On Tuesday, the ambulance union claimed that two people had died on Monday night waiting for delayed ambulances to arrive. Hammering health as its priority on every day of the campaign, SA Labor has also promised to ditch the Liberals proposed new $662m Riverbank arena, which it derides as a “basketball stadium”, and divert the funds into health. Political observers on both sides suggest Marshall is facing a “Mediscare” moment. The premier, who may have a positive story to tell about the investment being drawn into South Australia, is being overwhelmed by the campaign on health. Marshall’s enthusiasm for the state’s burgeoning space and tech industries is reminiscent of Malcolm Turnbull’s “jobs and growth” platform while he was being hammered relentlessly on Medicare before the 2016 federal election. Labor’s promise to fix ramping is caveated. The pledge is to reduce ambulance response times back to 2018 levels by the end of the next four-year term. “It won’t happen overnight,” he says. “We want to get ramping down to such a level that ambulances start rolling up on time, and we have said that will take us a full term to achieve.” Malinauskas’s weekly park runs promoted across social media are part of a slick campaign that includes shared Spotify playlists (featuring tracks that spell out a campaign slogan), a topless photo opportunity that earned him the moniker “commander in beef”, and populist policies such as bringing back the V8 supercar race to the city and tearing up a contract with a property developer to allow for a new Adelaide Crows headquarters. Labor has $3bn in new spending promises, including the $590m hydrogen plant, which have become the target of a Liberal scare campaign. The Liberals are finding it hard to blight Malinauskas, who is a centrist, a Catholic, and an Adelaide University football club veteran who has won support from within Adelaide’s business community. He is also eminently likable. SA Labor under campaign director Reggie Martin has a reputation for being among the best marginal seat campaigners in the country, regularly pushing the boundaries of acceptable practice to win. It once dressed volunteers up in Family First t-shirts to try to snare back some votes. Its Habib flyer was credited with sandbagging Elder in 2014. It knows how to win. By contrast, the Liberal party in SA are known for their ability to lose. The Liberals have spent most of the past 50 years in the political wilderness, winning four of the 15 elections held in the state since the end of Sir Tom Playford’s near-30 year reign in 1965. They are the least successful major political party of any state or territory. Beset by bitter internal disputes between moderates and conservatives, the Liberals famously returned to a minority government just one term after its landslide victory at the 1993 state bank election. Marshall, who was credited for successfully managing internal divisions to get into government, has now lost the support of much of his right flank. Private members’ bills on abortion and voluntary euthanasia that were backed by prominent moderates, including Marshall, have angered conservatives, with SA federal senator Alex Antic decrying the “egregious agenda of social policy reform” in state parliament. Marshall froze out conservatives while standing by his moderate deputy Vickie Chapman, who was finally stood aside after a conflict of interest saga that dragged on for months. Three conservative Liberal MPs have joined the crossbench – one over a state Icac probe into expense fraud, another who was acquitted of assault charges but found to be a “drunken pest”, and a third, Dan Cregan who defected and did a deal with Labor to assume the role of speaker. The disarray triggered by Cregan’s defection led Marshall to concede last year that while he had been focused on the pandemic, “maybe I should have spent more time on the politics”. But Marshall rejects criticism that he has failed to maintain party unity, saying he is the longest serving leader of the party since Thomas Playford, while stressing he intends to “create a better balance going forward” with conservatives in his cabinet. Voters, he believes, are more interested in outcomes than the political internals. “I think people are over politics, they want actual outcomes for themselves and for their families. I think South Australians know they’ve got lower costs, they’ve got a stronger economy and most importantly, they now have a state pride that just didn’t exist before.” “Labor are just political opportunists at every single turn and that has never served South Australia well.” Marshall also downplayed suggestions that Scott Morrison’s unpopularity could harm his chances, saying the state had an “excellent relationship” with the federal government that had served SA well. “We haven’t had that combative position that the previous state Labor government had, but that did not deliver for South Australia. Maybe it was good for them electorally, who knows, but it was certainly not good for South Australia.” The pendulum for the state’s parliament shows Labor – theoretically – has a straightforward path to victory. It needs a 2% swing to pick up the four seats needed to form a minority government with a Labor-aligned independent. If the only published Newspoll is correct, Labor is a shoo-in with a 5% swing. Marshall is already in minority, holding just 22 seats in the state’s 47 seat house of assembly. Labor holds 19 seats. There are six independents. But despite momentum clearly with Malinauskas in the run-up to the poll, confident predictions are few and far between given South Australia’s propensity to keep politics weird. At the last election, Marshall scraped into power amid a three-horse contest with Nick Xenophon despite expectations of a hung parliament. In 2014 Jay Weatherill clinched victory with a two-party preferred vote of just 47% after a legendary pizza negotiation led to his minority government. A former leader of the state Liberals later defected to sit at Weatherill’s cabinet table, shoring up Labor’s numbers. In 2010, Labor again defied expectations against an ascendant Isobel Redmond and maintained majority government, losing just two seats despite suffering an 8.4% swing against it. And going back a decade, Rann formed minority government in 2002 with a former Liberal turned speaker, Peter Lewis, and later boasted a Nationals MP as a Labor water minister. Former Liberal MPs running as independents have indicated they are prepared to negotiate, but given the state’s history, no one is ruling out one of the party’s defectors backing Labor. Marshall suggests this election will be an “arm wrestle”, but insists he can still win a majority. “People underestimated the Liberal party at the last election, people said there was no way we could form government, and three weeks out we were coming third in the polls,” he says. “Elections are always tight in South Australia. I mean everybody would like to be 60- 40% up a week from election day, but it very rarely happens in South Australia. This is no different. It’s going to go down to the wire.” Meanwhile, Malinauskas is talking down any suggestion of a landslide, insisting his task to take back the treasury benches after just four years in opposition is “substantial”. “I think politicians who try to make predictions these days are foolish. I mean, who has predicted an election outcome correctly in the last decade?” “What are we trying to do here? We’re trying to knock off a first term government, we’re trying to knock off a pandemic premier. It’s without precedent. “On paper, the pendulum says our task is difficult, but here’s what we have got going for us: We’ve done the policy work, we genuinely have a vision for the future, my team is united, we’re hungry, and we actually like each other’s company, which is more than the other mob can say. “And that gives us every shot.”",News/Australia news,South Australian election: can social media savvy Peter Malinauskas lead Labor back to power?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/south-australian-election-can-social-media-savvy-peter-malinauskas-lead-labor-back-to-power
3/16/2022,"Melbourne residents opposed to Tullamarine airport’s $1.9bn proposed third runway say the federal government must implement an independent committee to review noise impacts. While the proposal is still in the early consultation phase, residents say an independent forum should be established before the project is built. Last month, Brisbane airport began trialling aircraft noise reduction measures after the deputy prime minister and infrastructure minister, Barnaby Joyce, established an independent review of the impact of its new parallel runway, opened in 2020, following noise complaints. Melbourne airport’s third runway would run parallel to the existing north-south runway. Public consultation on the proposal ends in mid-May with the final plan for the 3km runway to be submitted to the federal infrastructure minister for approval next year. The retired GP Michael Howson, who has a farm on the the Maribyrnong River near the airport, said it was vital that a “totally independent expert commission” review the proposal. “This would assess the proposal rather than after the fact trying to mitigate or prevent the disaster,” he said. “There is no way of reducing noise to safe levels once it is built.” Howson has written to Joyce, urging him to commission a “fully independent expert review” of the proposed third runway. He said, based on current capacity and future projections, the runway would result in five times as many planes flying over Melbourne than currently fly over Brisbane. He said he was concerned about international studies which pointed to the negative health impacts from aircraft noise, particularly for students of nearby schools. Howson said the best comparison of noise impacts would be the short-term noise monitoring conducted by Airservices Australia at Horseshoe Bend Park in Keilor East in 2016. Horseshoe Bend is 1km further on from the end of the current north-south runway than Keilor would be from the proposed new runway. “This gives us the best idea of what’s happening, as there’ll be a noise level of that intensity – of around 70-80 decibels every three to six minutes,” he said. “If you allow for a 10 decibel difference for being indoors, that means there is a 60-70 decibel level, so the teacher trying to teach gets drowned or so needs to shout or wait for the planes to pass.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He argued these noise levels were incompatible with residential living and against the World Health Organization’s 2018 recommended safe maximum noise levels for aircraft noise. The former Brimbank mayor John Hedditch agreed a forum of independent experts was needed. Brimbank council’s area includes the suburbs directly south of the airport that will be impacted by the new flight path. “It’s got too much vested interests in it and I’m not confident we’re getting a balanced perspective at all,” he said. “The airport has an interest in getting the most viable, cost-effective operational model in place and that’s what it’s doing here. The community’s voice is not being heard by decision makers.” He said Melbourne’s second airport – Avalon – should be considered as an alternative for the additional runway. Hannah Robertson, a spokeswoman for the Melbourne Airport Community Action Group and Keilor local, said any forum would need to make a “genuine commitment to support the community” and genuinely explore “protecting health and wellbeing”.

It has forecast that annual passenger numbers will grow from 37 million to more than 76 million by 2042. The $1.9bn project is scheduled to be finished in 2027 at the earliest. A spokeswoman for Melbourne airport said an independentreview was a decision for the federal government. “We would fully participate if that decision was made,” she said. “Melbourne Airport engaged independent experts to rigorously assess environment, health and social aspects of this project, for the construction period and as operations begin and increase over time. “We are confident that the assessments are thorough, but we also welcome community analysis and response.” Joyce did not respond to questions.",News/Australia news,Calls for expert panel to study noise impacts of proposed third runway at Melbourne airport,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/calls-for-expert-panel-to-study-noise-impacts-of-proposed-third-runway-at-melbourne-airport
3/16/2022,"Environment groups have described a Morrison government plan to remove the need for federal environmental approval for developments in some regions as a “step towards an industry free-for-all” rather than an effort to protect nature. The government announced on Monday night it would use a little-known section of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act to establish what are known as regional plans. Under the law the environment minister may create regional plans and exempt certain developments – such as mining or agriculture – from the requirement to gain individual federal environmental approval in areas covered by a plan. The government has committed $62.3m in the budget to establishing plans in up to 10 yet-to-be-chosen regions as part of its push to reduce environmental bureaucracy. The announcement is part of a larger $128.5m package that also includes $37.9m for further streamlining of environmental assessments and $12m to modernise environmental offsets policy. The Wilderness Society (TWS) said it was deeply concerned the Coalition was pledging funding with the apparent aim of “circumventing environment protections for some of Australia’s most iconic and sensitive natural landscapes and wildlife”. “Given the government’s track record, we’re concerned that this seems like yet another step towards granting an industry free-for-all [rather] than an effort to protect nature,” said Suzanne Milthorpe, the national environment law manager for TWS. Since last year, legislation that would clear the way for the government to hand its environmental decision-making powers to state and territory governments has been blocked by the senate, in part because the Morrison government has not adopted a set of national environmental standards recommended by a review of national laws. Milthorpe said the new announcement was “consistent with the continued attempts to get around the parliament and effectively achieve bilateral agreements by stealth”. “There’s been 20 years of government reviews, audits and state of the environment reports all saying the one thing: Australia’s wildlife and natural landscapes are being destroyed because our environment laws are being sidelined in favour of fossil fuel and developer interests.” At a media conference in Mackay in Queensland on Tuesday, the environment minister, Sussan Ley, said if implemented, regional plans would have the effect of completing the environmental assessment and approval stages upfront, “rather than every single project starting their homework from the beginning”. She said it would give developers assurance their projects could proceed but there would be “no backwards step” for the environment. “Every part of this announcement is about making the environment more protected … but also recognising the effect that those awful delays have had on jobs and development,” she said. Tania Constable, the chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, said the changes would “help provide greater certainty for businesses to invest in regional Australia, supporting local communities, jobs and furthering sustainable development”. Andrew McConville, the chief executive of the oil and gas industry’s peak body, the Australian Petroleum Production & Exploration Association, said the announcement would result in “better environmental protection while reducing the costly regulatory burden on business”. The government has not announced any of the locations for its proposed regional plans, though the resources minister, Keith Pitt, has signalled his desire for Queensland’s Bowen basin to be considered. Establishing the plans will not be straightforward and will require cooperation from the relevant state or territory governments. Federal environment department officials told a senate estimates hearing last month that the location for a proposed pilot of a regional plan – funded in last year’s budget – still had not been chosen because conversations with a willing state or territory had not advanced. Freedom of information documents released to Guardian Australia last month show environment officials, as well as stakeholders who were consulted late last year, have also asked how compliance with environmental law would be enforced under a regional plan. In responses to separate questions from Guardian Australia, Ley’s spokesperson said the locations would be finalised after further discussions with the states and territories and would be selected across “differing bioregions and geographies”. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) called for more information from the government about its proposed regional planning approach and where the 10 priority areas would be. Sophie Power, the ACF’s biodiversity policy adviser, said regional planning had merits if it was used to improve the environment of a whole area. “We are concerned the government’s approach appears to focus on making things easier for resource extraction industries, rather than protecting nature,” Power said.

She said it had been more than a year since the federal government received the final report from the Samuel review, which found successive Australian governments had failed to protect the environment. “To this day, the Morrison government has still not formally responded,” she said. “Instead, we now see it has focused on looking to exploit a loophole in the EPBC Act to allow major projects to bypass federal environmental assessments through regional plans.” Vassarotti said the federal approvals process was important because it helped put environmental assessments by state and territory governments in a national context. “While regional plans could in principle be a useful tool … the agenda for this announcement is entirely skewed towards removing this national context and relying solely on individual jurisdictional analysis.”",News/Australia news,Environment groups say Coalition plan to bypass federal approvals a ‘step towards industry free-for-all’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/environment-groups-say-coalition-plan-to-bypass-federal-approvals-a-step-towards-industry-free-for-all
3/16/2022,"Wait times blew out for ambulances in NSW for patients with life-threatening conditions such as cardiac arrest during the Covid pandemic, a report published on Wednesday shows. The Australian Paramedics Association described the findings of the Bureau of Health Information (BHI) report as “alarming”, but said the pandemic was not entirely to blame for the worsening response times. The report shows the median response time for patients with life-threatening conditions, known as “P1A” cases, was 8.5 minutes in the October-December quarter of 2021. The benchmark is 10 minutes. In early September, the number of P1A responses per week peaked at 792, with the percentage of patients reached within 10 minutes sinking to 51.8% around the same time. Covid-19 cases added significant pressure to the workload of paramedics, the report shows. “Hospitalisations for people with Covid-19 during the Delta wave started from late June and increased gradually until late July,” the report found. “From August, these numbers increased sharply, with a peak of 1,266 patients with Covid-19 in hospital recorded on 20 September. Of those patients, 19% received care in intensive care units and 9% were ventilated.” There were 33,780 ambulance responses to P1A cases in 2021, up 7,001 (26.1%) compared with 2019 when data was last reported. The percentage of these cases reached within 10 minutes was 63%, compared with 71.4% in 2019. The number of high-priority patients with serious but not immediately life-threatening conditions, known as “P1” patients, increased in metropolitan areas as Covid-19 cases rose during Delta and Omicron waves, the data shows. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning There were 605,462 emergency P1 responses in 2021, with 46.6% reached within the benchmark time of 15 minutes, compared with 58.3% in 2019. The percentage of P1 cases reached within 15 minutes decreased sharply from the beginning of the Delta wave to a low of 34.2% in the week ending 11 September. “The emergence of the Omicron variant in late November resulted in another rise in weekly P1 responses – peaking at 12,589 in the week ending 18 December,” the report found. “Following a recovery, the percentage of P1 cases reached within 15 minutes decreased sharply again in December to a low of 37.2%.” The president of the Australian Paramedics Association NSW, Chris Kastelan, said the data reflected a five-year low for NSW Ambulance and some of the worst-ever response times recorded. In a statement, the union said “residents should be alarmed over worsening response times”. “NSW Ambulance is very clearly underperforming and, even more concerningly, we’re falling further behind with every quarter,” Kastelan said. But he said the pandemic was not wholly to blame. “Patients in NSW are waiting longer and longer for an ambulance, and it isn’t a temporary blip because of Covid – today’s figures map squarely onto a consistent downward trend over five years,” he said. “There’s no excuse for inaction in the face of these results. In an emergency situation, every minute counts. But in NSW, median response times have increased by three minutes in the past four years alone. “The government needs to step up, listen to frontline workers, and invest in better outcomes. We urgently need another 1,500 paramedics just to bring staffing ratios in line with other states.” The union is demanding better pay plus an investment in specialist paramedics who can treat patients at home, to reduce strain on the healthcare system. The chief executive of the BHI, Dr Diane Watson, said health services were responding to constant change caused by rises and falls in the number of Covid-19 cases. Increases in demand for emergency ambulance responses in September and December 2021 were in metropolitan areas, while rural and regional demand was stable throughout the year, Watson said. Meanwhile, the data shows efforts by NSW hospitals to increase elective surgery capacity in the first half of 2021 brought the waiting list down to pre-pandemic levels by June, before the Delta wave and subsequent suspension of non-urgent surgery in Sydney hospitals caused it to increase again in metropolitan local health districts. “In rural and regional local health districts, the waiting list decreased steadily throughout 2021,” Watson said. “Overall, while the waiting list reached a high for 2021 of 95,102 at the end of October, it was still below the record 101,024 in June 2020.” At the end of 2021, there were 10,770 patients on the waiting list who had waited longer than recommended, with 9,309 of those in metropolitan local health districts.",News/Australia news,"‘Worst ever’: sharp increase in wait times for NSW ambulances during Covid, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/worst-ever-sharp-increase-in-wait-times-for-nsw-ambulances-during-covid-report-finds
