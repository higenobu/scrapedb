3/22/2022,"A pro-Kremlin tabloid claimed in an article that close to 10,000 Russian soldiers have died during the country’s invasion of Ukraine, citing Russia’s Ministry of Defense, before deleting the information and claiming they were the result of a hack. The paper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, said in an article that 9,861 Russian soldiers had died and 16,153 had been injured during the invasion, according to data from the Defense Ministry. However, the article was reposted minutes later without the paragraph providing information on casualties. The original article was captured by the Internet Archive. The paper said the information was added by a hacker in a statement released shortly after the paragraph was deleted. The article couched those figures as a response to Ukrainian officials who claimed to have inflicted crippling losses on the Russian military. Ukraine claimed on Saturday that up to 14,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in fighting, while U.S.-intelligence estimates put the number of Russian dead at around 7,000. The Russian Ministry of Defense had previously acknowledged the combat deaths of just 498 soldiers. No other outlets carried the alleged Russian Ministry of Defense figures reported by Komsomolskaya Pravda. Russia has enacted policies to censor news and social media during the war with Ukraine, including passing a law that punishes citizens convicted of spreading “false information” on the war with up to 15 years in prison. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova on March 14 held up a sign that read “Stop the war. Don’t believe propaganda. They’re lying to you,” during a live broadcast by her former employer, Russia’s Channel One. Ovsyannikova was detained and fined 30,000 rubles over a separate video but still faces potential charges under the new law, according to ABC News. While Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in mid March that around 1,300 Ukrainian troops had died in the fighting, the government has not disclosed official casualty numbers. Civilian casualties also continue to mount in Ukraine. Russian forces are currently besieging the southern port city of Mariupol, where Ukrainian officials say around 2,000 civilians have been killed. Russian forces targeted a shopping mall in Kyiv on Monday, with at least eight people reportedly killed in that attack, according to Sky News. Russia claimed that Ukrainian forces were using the mall to store a rocket system.

3/22/2022,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled that a former county clerk from Kentucky knowingly violated the rights of same-sex couples by denying them marriage licenses in 2015, clearing the way for a jury trial seeking damages against her. The ruling from U.S. District Judge David Bunning on Friday also denied a request for immunity from former Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis. Davis thrust herself into the center of the U.S. culture wars on the issue of LGBTQ rights by denying the licenses in 2015, citing her religious beliefs. She briefly went to jail for contempt of court over her refusal and a deputy clerk in the eastern Kentucky county issued the licenses. The two couples in the lawsuit had sought to marry in the immediate aftermath of the landmark 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision Obergefell v. Hodges. They sued Davis in 2015, alleging she had violated their constitutional rights. In the Obergefell case, the highest court in the United States found that, under the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, states must grant same-sex marriages and recognize those of other states. But Davis repeatedly refused to issue marriage licenses, despite a letter from the governor instructing all county clerks to issue the licenses and a legal opinion from the Rowan County attorney, which she had sought, advising that she had a legal requirement to do so. ""It is readily apparent that Obergefell recognizes Plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment right to marry. It is also readily apparent that Davis made a conscious decision to violate Plaintiffs' right,"" the judge ruled in a summary judgment. With the essential facts in the case now settled, the two couples, David Ermold and David Moore in one case and James Yates and Will Smith in another, can proceed to jury trial to seek damages against Davis as an individual. Davis had previously been granted sovereign immunity in her official capacity. Liberty Counsel, a Christian organization representing Davis, said it would continue to argue she is not liable for damages because she is entitled to a religious accommodation granted by the state legislature and former Governor Matt Bevin. The group's statement also noted that conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court could seek to revisit and overturn the Obergefell decision. ""This case raises serious First Amendment free exercise of religion claims and has a high potential of reaching the Supreme Court,"" Liberty Counsel founder and Chairman Mat Staver said in the statement.

3/22/2022,"STORY: Speaking alongside British defense minister Ben Wallace during a visit to London, Reznikov said 150 Ukrainian children had been killed since Russia invaded, with more than 400 schools and kindergartens and more than 110 hospitals destroyed. ""This is a state terrorism. That is why (the) Kremlin must be stopped because it will go further. It will attack other countries,"" Reznikov said. He did not cite any evidence to support his assertion. Russia denies targeting civilians and denies its action is anything more than what it calls a 'special operation' to weaken Ukraine's military and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

3/22/2022,"U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn this weekend called a landmark 1965 Supreme Court ruling legalizing access to contraception ""constitutionally unsound"" in comments criticizing the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the high court. Blackburn's comments came ahead of Senate confirmation hearings for Jackson, nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Joe Biden. Blackburn, R-Tennessee, sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which began the hearings on Monday. Ruling: Decisions on same-sex marriage, contraception could be threatened by abortion ruling SCOTUS updates: Ketanji Brown Jackson hearing updates: Making history, first Black female SCOTUS nominee faces senators ""Constitutionally unsound rulings like Griswold vs. Connecticut, Kelo v. the city of New London, and NFIB vs. Sebelius confused Tennesseans and left Congress wondering who gave the court permission to bypass our system of checks and balances,"" Blackburn said in the video address. ""It is the 11th hour and Judge Jackson's stance on the Constitution remains a secret."" Blackburn's office on Monday declined to comment and did not address Tennessean questions about about her position on contraceptive access, including her specific objections to the ruling, if she would support a state's right to further legislate access to birth control and if she believes government power should supersede a marital right to privacy. The other cases Blackburn cited included a ruling on eminent domain and the Affordable Care Act. In a social media post last week, Blackburn called for ""constitutionalists"" who believe ""the Constitution is THE standard, and its meaning does not change over time."" The Griswold decision was a landmark case in 1965, when seven Supreme Court justices voted married couples have a right to ""marital privacy"" in the decision to use birth control. The decision invalidated a 19th-century Connecticut law banning contraceptive use. Though marital privacy, or broader privacy rights, are not explicitly stated in the Constitution, the majority in Griswold found that fundamental rights to privacy are implied within at least five amendments. Conservative critics who prefer a strict reading of the Constitution have long criticized the ruling as an overstep. Criticism of the Griswold case has emerged recently in hardline conservative circles with an eye on rolling back Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion 1973 ruling that heavily citied the Griswold case. Last month, three Michigan candidates criticized the Griswold decision as an infringement on states' rights. The Republican candidates for Michigan attorney general all decried the Griswold ruling at a debate in February, the Detroit Free Press reported.
