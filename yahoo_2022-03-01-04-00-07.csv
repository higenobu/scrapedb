3/1/2022,"Turkish-made Bayraktar drones have taken a prominent role in Ukraine's war effort. Commanders shared several video showing the TB2 model hitting Russian convoys. The footage was a needed morale boost as Russia continues its campaign. As Russia pounded Ukraine in the opening days of its invasion, the defenders credited a new piece of equipment with helping them fight back — the Bayraktar TB2 drone. Videos shared by the Ukrainian military showed at least one strike appearing to tear apart a column of Russian tanks and other armored vehicles. One came from Malyn in the Zhytomyr region, some 150 kilometers from the capital Kyiv, and showed the destruction of a Russian BUK surface-to-air missile launcher, per the Ukrainian military. ""Bayraktars at work,"" said the caption for the same video posted on an official military Facebook page. ""Be afraid, enemies, there will be no peace for you in our land."" The operators can be heard cheering after the strike lands. Another was from Chornobaivka, in southern Ukraine, an area that experienced heavy fighting from Russian forces pouring in via occupied Crimea. Later video from on the ground appears to show the results, with charred, smoking metal strewed along a highway. The first was shared by a Ukrainian embassy and the second by a staffer at the open-source research collective Bellingcat. The Russian invasion of Ukraine represents the first outing in a major conflict for the Bayraktar, an armed drone with 12-meter wingspan and distinctive triangular tail section. It is produced by the Turkish weapons manufacturer Baykar, which says the drones can reach altitudes of 25,000 ft and fly for 27 continuous hours, operated remotely from up to 300km away. Each one can carry up to four laser-guided bombs or rockets, for an estimated total payload of 150 kilograms. The Bayraktar is showing the effectiveness of small drones like this to unleash havoc on invading columns of vehicles. A US MQ-9 Reaper, by comparison, has a 20-meter wingspan and can carry up to 1,701 kilograms of ordnance. According to The Wall Street Journal, they can also be a powerful aid to artillery strikes by giving laser-pinpointed coordinates for strikes which would otherwise involve some guesswork. Ukraine received the drones for the first time in 2019, but didn't use them in combat until 2021. Its armed forces published a video of the first time it was used, to destroy a separatist piece of artillery in the Donbas region: It quickly acquired celebrated status among Ukrainians as war descended, and videos of its prowess went viral on social media: Insider counted well in excess of 5 million views across various iterations of the two above videos between Facebook and Twitter posts. In a widely-shared video of an unnamed Ukrainian soldier mocking the Russians, the drones' power was a key point: ""Is everything OK with you, dudes? How do you like our Bayraktars? What do you think... oh what's that flying over you right now?"" On Telegram, the popular channel run by the Ukrainian parliament shared both Bayraktar strike videos on Sunday, the first of which said ""Let's win together!"" and the second of which concluded ""Our army, our power!"" Ukraine's embassy to Turkey posted videos of the strikes and their aftermath. Per the Journal, one message in Turkish translated to: ""Never a rose without a thorn. Russian invaders have to put up with Bayraktar TB2s."" It said the embassy also called the strikes ""divine justice"", framing them as revenge for an airstrike in Syria that killed 34 of its troops, for which some have blamed Russia.

3/1/2022,"As Russian forces try to encircle Kyiv, the Biden Administration is growing concerned that if Russia’s efforts to take Ukraine’s capital city aren’t as successful as Russian President Vladimir Putin hopes, the situation in Ukraine could spiral even further. U.S. intelligence has suggested that Putin’s likely plan is to encircle and then take Kyiv—with hopes and dreams of installing a pro-Kremlin regime in Ukraine—but things are already not going according to plan. The Russians have become “frustrated” in recent days in their efforts to take the capital city, a senior U.S. defense official told reporters in a call Monday. “They have been slowed and they have been frustrated by their lack of progress on Kyiv.” How U.S. Special Forces Can Fight Putin Without Starting World War III And with that frustration comes consequences, the official warned. “We're certainly mindful that the frustrations could lead to a more aggressive approach by the Russians,” the official said, suggesting that Putin could escalate his forces' tactics. “One of the things that could result is a reevaluation of their tactics and the potential for them to be more aggressive and more overt in both the size and scale of their targeting of Kyiv.” The alarming warning about Putin’s possible impending temper tantrum comes after Russia watchers have sounded alarm at Putin’s activities, from his rage-filled speech kicking off his invasion into Ukraine, to his disregard for human and civilian life in Ukraine, to placing his nuclear forces on high alert. Leaders around the world are increasingly realizing just how deranged Putin may be, and taking steps to show other countries just what a pariah he is. The Biden Administration announced plans to sanction Putin personally last week, putting him on the same level as other dictators like North Korea’s Kim Jong-un. In the latest salvo, Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United Nations, compared Putin to Adolf Hitler, appearing to suggest Putin kill himself just like Hitler did a year after western Allied armies landed in Normandy, France, and pushed Germans back to Berlin. “If [Putin] wants to kill himself, he doesn’t need to use nuclear arsenal. He has to do what the guy in Berlin did in a bunker in… 1945,” Kyslytsya said Monday at a United Nations General Assembly meeting on Russia’s invasion. As of Monday, Russian forces are still approximately 25 kilometers away from Kyiv, the official said—just five kilometers closer than they were this weekend. And on the way, they’ve had several setbacks. Belarus Issues Dire World War III Warning as It Gets Ready to Send Troops to Ukraine The Biden administration isn’t sure whether the delay is due to lack of planning or running through their supplies too quickly and not executing their plans properly. But they are certainly running out of gas, the U.S. official said. “Fuel and sustainment are unique challenges to them right now,” the senior U.S. defense official said. “Our indications are that they ended up having to rely on fuel and sustainment capabilities earlier in the process than what we believed they had planned to… they’re running out of gas and they’re having logistics problems.” Part of Russia’s problems keeping its forces sustained is due to Ukrainian resistance, according to the official. Ukrainians are putting up a strong resistance in multiple Ukrainian cities Putin wants to lay his hands on, the official said. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/1/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin is feeling the consequences of the invasion of Ukraine, as world leaders and corporations slash ties to the Kremlin left and right. In the days following the announcement that he had authorized invading the neighbor country, entities ranging from world leaders to small business owners are consistently attempting to squeeze Russia out of the global economy. On Saturday, the United States, Canada and other European allies released a joint statement announcing that ""selected"" Russian banks would be removed from the SWIFT financial system. UKRAINE BATTLES RUSSIAN FORCES: LIVE UPDATES A senior Biden administration official explained that the financial system is comparable to ""Gmail for banks,"" and said that the effects could be crippling. ""If one of these de-SWIFTED and Russian banks wants to make or receive a payment with a bank outside of Russia, such as a bank in Asia, it will now need to use the telephone or a fax machine. And in all likelihood most banks around the world will simply stop transacting altogether with Russian banks that are removed from SWIFT,"" the senior administration official said. Many countries are also barring Russian flights from entering their airspace, such as members of the European Union and Canada. In a statement, the European Union President Ursula von der Leyen said that airspace within the EU will be shut down for Russian airlines, and even private jets that are Russian registered. ""Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane – and that includes the private jets of oligarchs,"" der Leyen said. ""This will apply to any plane owned, chartered or otherwise controlled by a Russian legal or natural person."" Several U.S. states, including Ohio, Virginia and New Hampshire, have also halted the sale and purchase of Russian-made vodka. PUTIN IS PLAYING 'POKER' WITH USA AND EUROPEAN ALLIES, TRYING TO 'BLUFF,' EXPERT SAYS ""Today I directed @OhioCommerce to cease both the purchase & sale of all vodka made by Russian Standard, the only overseas, Russian-owned distillery with vodka sold in Ohio. Russian Standard's vodka is sold under the brand names of Green Mark Vodka & Russian Standard Vodka,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tweeted on Saturday. A Las Vegas bar owner and his patrons took to the street to literally pour Russian vodka down the drain. LAS VEGAS BAR OWNER AND PATRONS POUR RUSSIAN VODKA DOWN THE DRAIN IN SHOW OF SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE Retired CIA Senior Clandestine Services Officer Dan Hoffman told Fox News Digital that Russia currently has a cloud of ""cr-p"" around them, and no individual wants to do business with them. ""Even if you're a business that doesn't care about anything except making money, the last thing you want to be doing is go there. You go to lots of other places to do your business, you don't need to go there,"" Hoffman said. Oil companies are also taking action against Putin, as BP announced Sunday it is dropping its stake in Russian energy company Rosneft, in which it has a 19.75% stake, according to its chief executive, Bernard Looney. He will also resign from the Rosneft board. ""I am convinced that the decisions we have taken as a board are not only the right thing to do, but are also in the long-term interests of bp,"" Looney said in a statement. ""Our immediate priority is caring for our great people in the region and we will do our utmost to support them."" BP Chairman Helge Lund also cited the Russian invasion of Ukraine as the reason for making the decision. ""Russia’s attack on Ukraine is an act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region,"" Lund said. ""BP has operated in Russia for over 30 years, working with brilliant Russian colleagues. However, this military action represents a fundamental change."" Anti-Putin protests have erupted in cities around the world as thousands in Switzerland, England, Germany, Greece, Italy, Taiwan, Spain, France, and the United States flooded the streets in support of Ukraine. People in Russia are turning their back to Putin, with more than 3,000 protesters across the country reportedly arrested between Thursday and Sunday morning, according to the human rights group OVD-Info.
