2/14/2022,"Not the knockout blow Eddie Jones was seeking when urging his side to channel Muhammad Ali but mercifully it is always a safe bet Marcus Smith will float like a butterfly when afforded this much time and space. Italy’s 34th consecutive Six Nations defeat will not live long in the memory but this could yet prove to be a seminal moment in Smith’s England career. The 22-year-old is destined for a long and prosperous run in the No 10 jersey and already you sense England’s World Cup hopes next year will largely hinge on Smith’s form. His performance here is significant in that regard because this was the first time that Jones has truly given him licence to showcase his full array of attacking talents, the first occasion where it has felt like he has his head coach’s total trust.  To illustrate, it was the 28th minute when Smith hoisted a high kick down the middle of the field to be contested. When he made his debut last summer against USA it was the very first thing he did but here, with the lively Harry Randall inside him, with Harlequins teammates Alex Dombrandt and Joe Marchant rarely far away, Smith was given the freedom of Rome by Jones. Short of a battering ram at inside-centre – the role that André Esterhuizen performs so well for Harlequins – while Manu Tuilagi gets back up to speed, Jones gave Smith all the ammunition he needed to “light up Rome”. His determination to run with the ball, to play with his head up was evident throughout and it was little surprise that he got the ball rolling with the opening try. Maybe the best compliment to be paid to Smith is that it does not bear thinking about how England might have performed had he not been on the field. Indeed, Jones rarely bows to external pressure but it felt telling that when he introduced George Ford in the closing stages Smith stayed on the field. That was less about versatility and more to do with acknowledging his performance had been too polished to withdraw him from the field prematurely, as he did against Scotland. It allowed him to produce a trademark goosestep late on – as England emerged from the slumber they slipped into in the second half it was he who fizzed a fine pass to Elliot Daly for his try. All be told it was a performance full of swagger from Smith, who displayed a maturity against Scotland but an assuredness here. A different challenge posed and another emphatic answer. The intent was obvious the moment Jones announced a team with so many attacking threats but perhaps the most interesting selection was that of Randall at scrum-half, next to Smith, who also caught the eye. The 24-year-old has had his injury problems but he and Smith dovetailed well last summer and Jones clearly believes it is a partnership worth persevering with. That in itself is interesting because, those matches against USA and Canada aside, Ben Youngs had started every England match since the 2019 World Cup. It is a rare thing indeed for Youngs to be omitted from the starting lineup and the fact that this was the occasion when he equalled Jason Leonard’s all-time England caps record of 114 yet still he was benched felt telling. For his willingness to trust Randall demonstrates his determination to broaden England’s attacking horizons and certainly the Bristol scrum-half provides Smith with a speed and crispness of ball that Youngs does not always offer. His kicking left plenty to be desired and it would be a bold move to start him against Wales but it must be said his withdrawal coincided with England’s slip into ennui. “[Marcus and Harry] made a really good start,” said Jones. “There was a lot of pace on the ball early. Marcus took the ball to the line really well in patches and Harry added that little bit of zip.” What’s more, for all the promise that Smith and to a lesser extent Randall showed, there were times when England looked frantic. Max Malins had a fine match but early on he twice fumbled the ball and for all that Ellis Genge delivered a delightful assist for Jamie George’s second try, for Smith’s pass to Daly, equally there were some sloppy mistakes or missed opportunities. Freddie Steward had a far more accomplished performance than against Scotland but he really ought to have found Smith on his inside in the first half while Dombrandt found himself running around in a circle at one point – evidence that the new attacking machine is not truly oiled just yet. What will disappoint England supporters the most is the manner in which their side coasted to the final whistle in the last 20 minutes. It is entirely understandable that the levels of intensity did not come anywhere near to matching Saturday’s two gripping contests but still, supporters wanted to see England as Jones has urged them: to be ruthless and leave Italy on the canvas. In truth it was never a heavyweight contest but with Smith at the helm, chalk it up as an emphatic England win on points.",Sport/Sport,Marcus Smith proves he can knock teams to the canvas for Eddie Jones,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/13/marcus-smith-proves-he-can-knock-teams-to-the-canvas-for-eddie-jones
2/14/2022,"Trouble with defenders has been the defining theme of the season so far for Leicester, but in the run-up to the visit of West Ham, Brendan Rodgers was offered a kind of comfort – in the form of a reminder that things could, in theory, have been worse. All of the many players he has had to use in defence have made costly mistakes in this campaign, sometimes several times in the same match. But none have featured in home movies involving a tormented cat. So there’s that. Much of Leicester’s chronic instability can be traced back to the injury suffered in pre-season by Wesley Fofana, the precocious Frenchman who quickly became fundamental to Leicester after joining from Saint-Étienne as a 19-year-old in 2020. Fofana continues to make his way back from the leg break inflicted in an August friendly and may return to full training this month. Whenever he is fit enough to regain his place, he will be welcomed back warmly.  There was no such welcome on Sunday for West Ham’s Kurt Zouma, just boos when the stadium announcer read out his name. Another player to arrive in English football from Saint-Étienne as a 19-year-old, the Frenchman has played in the Premier League for four clubs over the past eight years and generally been regarded as a decent, dependable centre-half, apt to head a goal from a set-piece but otherwise unlikely to inflame passions. And then came that outrageous, ludicrous, sad video. Suddenly Zouma is a public enemy, an ex-cat owner and embarrassment to his club. West Ham fined him but chose not to drop him. On Friday David Moyes appealed for the player to be shown “a little bit of forgiveness” and to be allowed to learn and atone. Which is convenient for the club who have invested a lot of money and hope in the player. But it is also a fair plea, especially in an age when justified condemnation can quickly acquire a metaphorical, hypocritical bloodlust. Some denouncers of human folly or wickedness have at least one trait in common with the hunters on MyOutdoorTV, the subscription channel run by a company owned by Arsenal’s Stan Kroenke. It turned out that West Ham did not get to deploy Zouma at Leicester because the player, apparently, felt unwell during the warmup and had to pull out of the match. One hopes he recovers. Issa Diop stepped into the visitors’ defence in place of Zouma. It took him less than 10 minutes to make his mark and, in the process, tore a now-familiar look of panic across the faces of Leicester’s defenders. Diop’s long straight pass from the back exposed the looseness and slowness of the home defence. Jarrod Bowen peeled off James Justin and raced into the space behind Caglar Soyuncu and Daniel Amartey before lashing a crisp left-foot finish past Kasper Schmeichel. West Ham have been frustrated in recent weeks by teams who sit deep and deny them such space, but Leicester seldom play that way, especially at home, and their offside trap was faulty. Leicester’s grim luck with injuries continued on the half hour when Justin, only recently back from 11 months out with knee damage, was forced off. Rather than wallow in their misfortune, Leicester kept trying to pick their way through the West Ham defence. They were not making many inroads until Aaron Cresswell failed to use his head and gave them a hand. Youri Tielemans dispatched the penalty perfectly. Leicester played from there like a team reprieved. Soon they splayed the visiting defence regularly. Harvey Barnes caused Vladimir Coufal so much pain that Moyes decided the merciful thing to do was replace him with a different right-back. Ryan Fredericks coped better. On the left, Cresswell was at times overwhelmed. When Barnes duped Coufal on the hour and chipped a cross to the back post, Ricardo Pereira hurled himself in front of Cresswell to head his first league goals since rupturing a cruciate ligament two years ago. It was a moment of personal triumph for the Portuguese as well as a kind of collective redemption for Leicester’s defenders, who had tightened up since that inauspicious start. It seemed for a while that it would also be the winning goal. But West Ham are chasing Champions League qualification and Leicester’s defensive record incites opponents. They have conceded more goals from set pieces than any other Premier League team this season so, when Bowen swung in a corner in stoppage time, there was no surprise to see Diop’s central defensive partner, Craig Dawson, leaping above Amartey to send the ball into the net. The fact that it did not come off his head as he intended, but off the top of his arm, added a touch of bad luck that made the goal all the more typical of Leicester’s season.",Sport/Football,West Ham cope with Zouma’s no-show while Foxes’ failings laid bare again | Paul Doyle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/13/west-ham-cope-with-zoumas-no-show-while-foxes-failings-laid-bare-again
2/14/2022,"Before 60 Minutes went to air on Sunday night, a mate of mine called to express her frustration. She’d seen the clips of the prime minister strumming his Hawaiian instrument while the Morrison family looked on semi-awkwardly and Karl Stefanovic presided at the head of the table, a couple of margaritas in, looking like he’d just bagged a Logie.  She’d seen April Sun in Cuba (Oh-Oh-Oh-My-God-Make-It-Stop); the breathless promos trumpeting Jenny Morrison as her husband’s “secret weapon”. Enough already, was her point. Enough of whatever this infomercial was. Enough of Morrison’s ephemera, the featherweight impressionism, the rehearsed verisimilitude. Daggy dad. Sharkies fan. Curry chef. Identities curated and stacked inside one another like hollow babushka dolls. Why, my mate wondered, can’t we just have a prime minister? Just that. A prime minister. Plain and simple. Weighted and steadied by the office. The times felt too serious for this vaudevillian engineering his reboot on prime-time television. Morrison’s first-world problem – would he win the coming federal election? – didn’t really feel that pressing, with people still dying, with businesses struggling to come back from their government-induced hibernation. She felt of all the characters Morrison had constructed, his character of prime minister remained the least fleshed out, and consequently, the least convincing. Given the character of prime minister would be the only one that ultimately mattered, this seemed an oversight. Prime minister Morrison – if he was ever really there forcefully enough to make a lasting imprint – was now in danger, she felt, of disappearing entirely. The constant packaging and repackaging was overwhelming the present. I had these observations front of mind on Sunday night as Morrison sat beside wife Jenny and spectated while she said a bunch of things the prime minister evidently felt he couldn’t say. Like sorry about that ill-timed overseas holiday (but I remember a time when prime ministers were allowed to be humans). Like Grace Tame’s cause is noble but that young woman should learn to mind her manners. Like that Magda Szubanski isn’t very nice. Like my husband absolutely isn’t a psycho, he’s just very task-oriented. Like Peter van Onselen shouldn’t ask questions at the National Press Club that upset my daughters and make me “feel sick to my stomach”. It was prime ministership by proxy. By character reference. This is not intended to be a criticism of Jenny Morrison. She’s an intelligent woman. A warm and relatable person. A loyal spouse is as entitled to express her views as anyone else. She doesn’t need anyone’s permission to speak. But there’s a simple point to make. If there’s a mess, Jenny Morrison isn’t responsible for the cleanup. It shouldn’t be incumbent on her to have to explain or translate her husband to Australian voters; to be Scott’s secret weapon. This idea is actually so patronising it’s hard to know where to begin with it quite honestly. Before Sunday night’s program went to air I just assumed such a hackneyed conceit was a bit of troglodyte magazine television puffery – a cliche rolling off the same production line as happy wife, happy life, and boy, he’s punching above his weight there. But Jenny to the rescue was the trope of choice, and everyone did seem to lean in. Here’s the thing. In case it isn’t obvious, Scott Morrison is the prime minister. It is Morrison’s record voters will be evaluating in a few months time. If the prime minister is having trouble connecting with people, if people are angry with him, that’s on him. If people are tired of poor judgments, the antidote is simple. The prime minister needs to make better judgments. If people think Morrison lacks empathy, he could try a little humility. I suspect that’s more effective than special pleading. And most of all: if Morrison has a substance problem, if voters are wondering what is real, the answer to that is not more puffery.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison’s problems won’t be solved by Jenny or engineered TV puffery | Katharine Murphy,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/scott-morrisons-problems-wont-be-solved-by-jenny-or-engineered-tv-puffery
2/14/2022,"Good morning. Australia has ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Kyiv as the Ukraine crisis worsens. Some countries are warning their citizens to leave the country entirely. And vulnerable Australians are being forced to hide at home due to expensive Covid tests. Roughly one in three Australians have confidence in the Morrison government, which is the lowest approval since the 2019-20 summer bushfires, according to a survey. The longitudinal survey of 3,472 Australians was conducted in the final two weeks of January, as the Omicron wave and eased restrictions resulted in some days with more than 100,000 new Covid cases. The ANU’s Centre for Social Research and Methods found 34.5% of adult Australians had confidence or were “very confident” in the federal government, down from a peak of 60.6% in May 2020.  Scott Morrison has ordered the evacuation of the Australian embassy in Kyiv, warning the situation in Ukraine has reached a dangerous stage. The order echoes that of many other countries, including Britain and Germany, who have advised their citizens to leave immediately. Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, says the government has directed the departure of embassy staff to a temporary office in Lviv, with the buildup of Russian troops on the border. Britain believes that Russia’s powerful FSB spy agency has been given the task of trying to engineer coups in Ukraine’s major cities in the immediate aftermath of any invasion launched by the Kremlin. Meanwhile, fears of flying over Ukrainian airspace have led some airlines to scrap or divert flights as tensions between the west and the Kremlin mount over a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine. Vulnerable Australians are being forced into “hiding at home” and lower-income workers are forfeiting meals because of the cost of rapid Covid antigen tests, unions and welfare charities have warned as they plead with the Morrison government to reverse its long-held opposition to providing free testing kits for all people. Despite the government’s recent move to make rapid antigen tests tax deductible for workers and businesses, a coalition of advocacy groups including the Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) warn the tax write-off plan provides a greater discount to higher-income earners. The so-called “Super Saturday” byelection results may be bad for the NSW government, but they are not surprising. While the full results won’t be known for weeks, it was clear by Saturday evening that the government had lost Bega for the first time since the seat was created in the 1980s. Two years of the pandemic have meant drops in essential screening and detection, while cancer patients undergo treatments alone and isolate to avoid Covid risks. A proposed new coal-fired power station at Collinsville in north Queensland is now being pitched as a “flexible” firming project – a pivot that neatly aligns with federal government moves to bankroll such plans. Unemployment in regional Australia has dropped below the magic 4% but experts say the outcome is “double-edged”, as surging vacancies amid a shallow labour pool looms as the bigger issue. As disillusionment with the Morrison government grows, a new generation of female independents is emerging to run against the system itself. Rudolph Giuliani, who was prominent in Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election result, is considering giving testimony to the congressional committee investigating the deadly 6 January Capitol insurrection, the New York Times reported on Sunday. Police moved in to clear and arrest the remaining protesters near a key US-Canadian border bridge early Sunday, trying to end one of the main demonstrations that have broken out across Canada against Covid vaccine mandates and other restrictions to bring the pandemic under control. The husband of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian charity worker detained in Iran, has said she is “very, very angry” after learning about the collapse of a deal to bring her home. Zaghari-Ratcliffe fears she is a “bargaining chip” in ongoing nuclear talks and is filled with “anger at her life being stolen” and the government’s “lack of urgency” in securing her release, Richard Ratcliffe said. New research into sudden weight loss finds a possible cause of cachexia in cancer patients and Cockayne syndrome in children. Trekking into a walk-in campsite with a tent and provisions for fire-cooked meals on your back can definitely be a romantic experience. But if you’re after intimacy and seclusion that is a little less rugged, accommodation in scenic areas often escalates from under-the-stars to five stars, with not much in the middle. We’ve scoured Australia for short stays and experiences that feel special but not extravagant, within a few hours of every capital city. “In 2021 my mother lost her partner of 33 years and my year-long relationship ended,” writes Natasha May. “The grief we feel in missing romantic love has bound us tighter than ever.” It’s been one year since Brittany Higgins came forward with sexual assault allegations that shook the government. Last week she spoke at the National Press Club alongside former Australian of the Year Grace Tame about Scott Morrison’s failure to lead on this issue.

2/14/2022,"Jenny Morrison says she was a little bit disappointed with the behaviour of the former Australian of the Year Grace Tame during a function at the Lodge in January, and hopes her own daughters will be “fierce” but also show “manners and respect”. The prime minister’s spouse told the Nine Network on Sunday night the focus during the reception on 25 January should have been “on all the incredible people coming in” so Tame’s unwillingness to smile at her hosts or for the cameras was “a little bit disappointing, because we’ll welcome you in our home”.  The prime minister has repeatedly declined to criticise Tame in the controversy that followed the reception on the eve of Australia Day. Tame, a survivor advocate, won last year’s Australian of the Year prize after her advocacy was instrumental in overturning a Tasmanian law preventing survivors from speaking publicly about their assault. During the function for the 2022 Australian of the Year finalists in Canberra, Tame – who had roundly criticised Morrison’s suboptimal response to federal parliament’s #MeToo reckoning during the previous 12 months – declined to engage in conventional niceties. Last week, during an appearance at the National Press Club, Tame said last August she had received a “threatening” phone call from a senior member of a government-funded organisation warning her not to criticise the prime minister on the eve of last month’s Australian of the Year awards because there was “an election coming soon”. In response to the allegation, the prime minister said he had not and would not authorise any such actions. The National Australia Day Council has denied having threatening conversations with Tame. The Morrison family participated in an extended interview with the Nine Network’s 60 Minutes program on Sunday night. Jenny Morrison is rarely interviewed, but she was a significant focus of the program, characterised as the prime minister’s “secret weapon” in the looming federal election campaign. Jenny Morrison addressed several controversies that have eroded her husband’s standing with voters during the program – including the family’s now infamous holiday in Hawaii during the catastrophic summer bushfires in 2019-20. Morrison has said previously he followed through with the holiday because he had made a promise to his wife and daughters. Jenny Morrison said she was “more than sorry if we disappointed” in the decision to leave the country during the bushfire emergency. “I thought I was making the right decision for my kids. I obviously was wrong.” She said she wish the holiday had never happened “but I can’t change it”. While apologising for the misjudgment, she also editorialised about the subsequent public backlash. She made the point that expectations of contemporary prime ministers were different than the expectations that surrounded earlier prime minister, like Bob Hawke. “I think then it was OK to have a holiday and things like that and, and it doesn’t seem that way now. “Like, people want you to be seen to be doing something, um, all the time.” When the former Liberal party staffer, Brittany Higgins, alleged last year she’d been sexually assaulted in Parliament House, Morrison at one point told journalists it had taken a conversation with his wife to prompt him to display more empathy. Morrison was widely criticised for his perceived mishandling of the aftermath of Higgins’ allegation which triggered a broader #MeToo reckoning in the Australian parliament and led to public rallies. Morrison’s standing with female voters took a significant hit during the furore. The prime minister attempted to recover from the damage by introducing more workplace support for political staff and by reshuffling his cabinet to amplify a female “perspective” within the government. Asked by the interviewer Karl Stefanovic on Sunday night whether it had taken a conversation with her for the prime minister to really comprehend the seriousness of Higgins’ allegation, Jenny Morrison leapt to her husband’s defence. “I think Scott totally gets things,” she said. “I think he’s all about problem solving. And so, that can come across sometimes as serious, uncaring or lacking empathy. But it isn’t that at all.” She said her husband was very task oriented, and as a result of his focus, the environment in Parliament House was changing. “I feel happy that that will happen. “That my girls in like 10 years’ time – heaven forbid if they want to go into politics – can walk safely around and know what’s going on.” Jenny Morrison said her husband should be permitted to reflect publicly on some of their private conversations. “I think he should be able to say what happens with us in our life. “Yes, he talks to me regularly. Do I make policy decisions? Absolutely not. Would you want me to? Because they’d be bad. But I can tell him how I feel about something.” The prime minister’s wife said the ruthlessness of professional politics repelled her, but she said she wanted her husband to win the coming election contest. A Newspoll published on Sunday evening has Labor 10 points ahead of the Coalition on that survey’s two-party-preferred measure.
