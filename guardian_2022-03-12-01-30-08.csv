3/12/2022,"The UK government views the British property tycoon Nick Candy and a consortium headed by Todd Boehly and Hansjörg Wyss as serious contenders to buy Chelsea after inviting potential bidders to approach it with takeover proposals. Chelsea are in an unprecedented state of limbo after sanctions were imposed on Roman Abramovich, with the Russian oligarch barred from selling the club for the time being, but the feeling in Westminster is that the government believes the process of finding a new owner will not be derailed by this week’s dramatic developments. The decision to freeze Abramovich’s assets because of his ties to Vladimir Putin and the Russian government has left Chelsea at risk of major financial problems, but it has not deterred parties interested in buying the club. Boehly and Wyss are waiting for a response to their opening offer, which was between £2bn and £2.5bn, and Candy is working on a proposal. There is also strong interest from Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs. Neither Johnson nor the Ricketts family has responded to questions about their plans. The situation is urgent from Chelsea’s perspective. They have been granted a special licence to continue football-related activities but they are operating under heavy restrictions. Abramovich is unable to put money into Chelsea and fears are growing that the European champions could fall into administration if a sale is not agreed soon because they are not permitted to collect matchday income, merchandise sales have been banned and the shirt sponsor Three has suspended its partnership. However the government is keen to target Abramovich rather than Chelsea, which it views as a “significant cultural asset”, and it will consider an application for a new licence that would permit a sale. Chris Philp, the digital and technology minister, said on Friday that Abramovich would be prevented from selling the club but potential buyers could approach the government with takeover proposals as long as the Russian would not benefit from the deal. The viability of potential buyers is being discussed in political circles. Boehly and Wyss remain confident that their consortium, which includes an unnamed businessman, will be viewed favourably by the government and Premier League. It is understood that Candy, a Tory donor, is also seen as a strong contender to buy Chelsea. The property developer is working on finding investors and his proposals include plans for an expensive redevelopment of Stamford Bridge, which could work in his favour. Candy, a Chelsea fan, is worth a reported £1.5bn. “We are examining the details of yesterday’s announcement and we are still interested in making a bid,” Candy’s spokesperson said. “Clearly, this is a time of great uncertainty for all Chelsea fans. In our view, no one is the owner of a football club – you are the custodian of it for the fans and the community.” The sale process is being overseen by the New York-based bank The Raine Group. Other interested parties include the Turkish businessman Muhsin Bayrak, Jamie Reuben and the Crystal Palace shareholder Josh Harris. However there is a feeling that even if Reuben wanted to step away from Newcastle United, it would be difficult because the Reuben Brothers property business founded by his father and uncle not only holds a 10% stake in the club but is heavily involved in implementing Saudi-funded plans to launch hundreds of thousands pounds worth of regeneration projects on Tyneside. The UK government and Premier League are understood to be extremely keen to see the proposed redevelopments start taking shape, and previously closed doors may be now opened for Reuben Brothers to explore business opportunities in Saudi Arabia and the wider Gulf region. Moreover Jamie Reuben is said to be enjoying his directorship at St James’ Park and was at Southampton on Thursday night, cheering Eddie Howe’s team on alongside his co-director Amanda Staveley. Chelsea, who host Newcastle in the Premier League on Sunday, remain in discussions with the government about softening some of the restrictions it faces – including a £20,000 limit on costs for away matches. That limit does not apply to Wednesday’s Champions League at Lille because it had already been booked. The licence permits Chelsea to continue paying employees but does not allow Abramovich to profit from the club’s income. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We’re in constant contact with the club and the Premier League over any issues that have been raised through the sanctions and the licence that the Treasury has issued them. In terms of process, it’s now up to the club to apply for any amended licence. I believe Chelsea have said that they will do that, and we’ll obviously work with the club to consider any operationally necessary changes. But as we said yesterday, the measures we put in place are to ensure that any revenue generated can’t find its way back to the Putin regime.” Chelsea fans have faced criticism for chanting Abramovich’s name during their side’s win at Norwich on Thursday. The government spokesperson added: “We understand the strength of feeling that Chelsea fans will have, and their passion for the club. But it’s important to remember that these sanctions are being imposed on those who have provided support to the Putin regime and the brutal assault on Ukraine.”",Sport/Football,Nick Candy and Boehly-Wyss seen as serious Chelsea buyers by government,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/nick-candy-todd-boehly-hansjorg-wyss-serious-chelsea-buyers-government-roman-abramovich
3/12/2022,"Regular listeners to the BBC Radio 5 Live film show must bid tinkety tonk old fruits to presenters Mark Kermode and Simon Mayo, who have announced that the show will come to an end after 21 years on air. The church of Wittertainment will hold its final service – before setting off on one of its fabled cruises into the sunset – on 1 April. Mayo announced the news at the beginning of Friday’s live show. “Twenty-one years is a long time to be clogging up the schedules and we have decided – and to be clear, no one else has decided – to … step away, to withdraw, to spread our wings, to exit pursued by a bear. We are way too expensive and there are much better things for the BBC to be spending their money on.” Mayo stated that the 1 April edition would be “our last show on 5 Live”, and Kermode tweeted a photo of Spinal Tap captioned, “But like Tap, we’ll be back … stay tuned”, hinting at the possibility that the pair’s cinematic double act might find a new home elsewhere. The news marks Mayo’s conclusive departure from the BBC after he left the Radio 2 Drivetime show in October 2018 – following a controversial pairing with Jo Whiley – first moving to Scala Radio and later Greatest Hits Radio. Kermode hosts the weekly television Film Review on the BBC News channel and will continue to present Screenshot alongside Ellen E Jones on BBC Radio 4. They are the latest high-profile talent to depart the BBC for the commercial sector: Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel have joined Global for a new show, and footballer Peter Crouch is taking his podcast to Acast. Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review began life as a segment on Mayo’s 5 Live radio show in 2001 and later a podcast in 2005. It became a fully fledged two-hour show in 2010. In 2014, it was the BBC’s second most-downloaded podcast, although it did not appear in the broadcaster’s top 10 programmes last year – now facing much stiffer competition from the broadcaster’s renewed focus on podcasts and BBC Sounds – or Baby Sea Clowns, as a withering Mayo would put it. The format of the show includes a digressive countdown of the UK’s Top 10 films – often starting with a low-charting outlier that previously received praise from Kermode – an interview with a film star or director, usually conducted by Mayo, in-depth reviews of the week’s new films, and much interaction with listeners. The oft-bickering duo also consider the TV movie of the week, as well the “so bad it’s bad” TV movie of the week, and assess new DVD releases – a feature that had ostensibly been limping to its end as physical media dies out. Over its duration, the show has established a vast amount of in-jokes and lore with its listeners – rather, members of the church – who may identify as STLs (short-term listeners), MTLs (medium-term) or LTLs (long-term), depending on the length of their relationship with the show. They might write in to say hello to actor Jason Isaacs, a friend of the show; to confess to the tiny cinematic hill they wish to die on; or to report violations of the show’s Code of Conduct for cinemas, which includes “no eating anything harder than a soft roll” and “no irresponsible parenting” – and certainly no eating a full Mexican meal, as once witnessed by a scarred Mayo. The show has also kept track of listeners’ births, deaths and marriages, testament to the personal relationship that many have cultivated with it. That bond was strengthened during the UK’s lockdowns. Despite cinemas being closed, the show continued on a weekly basis with Kermode and Mayo broadcasting from their respective homes – the former usually doing battle with a noisy boiler – and reviewing digital releases and coining new forms of merriment to make up for the lack of new material to cover. While film-makers such as Michael Bay and those behind the movies of Entourage and Sex and the City may breathe a sigh of relief at the acerbic pair’s departure from the BBC, online, the tributes were manifest – and unredacted by the show’s producer, usually merciless with scrubbing praise from the end of listeners’ emails. Live on Friday’s show, Kermode followed Mayo’s announcement with the invocation of a line familiar to Wittertainees (and Tom Hanks): “Just to add, as we’ve always said, it’ll all be alright in the end – and if it’s not alright, it’s not the end.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘We’ll be back … stay tuned’: Kermode and Mayo’s BBC Radio 5 Live film show to end after 21 years,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/11/well-be-back-stay-tuned-kermode-and-mayos-bbc-radio-5-live-film-show-to-end-after-21-years
3/12/2022,"Step by step the Ukrainian soldiers advance and position themselves in the woods, their weaponry all too visible from their shoulders. If there was any doubt about whether western arms were getting into the hands of Ukraine’s soliders, footage posted on social media on Thursday dispelled those concerns. It shows Ukrainian light infantry, some wearing the country’s distinctive yellow armbands, carrying several types of anti-tank weapons, including British NLAWs, and rocket-propelled grenades, as part of what is said to be a counterattack against Russian forces near Kyiv. But while it may appear heroic, it is still not anywhere near a fair fight. There has been an intense focus on Russia’s strategy, tactics and deployment since the start of the war in Ukraine, but there has been relatively little said about Ukraine’s approach. The footage offered a rare glimpse of what Ukraine can offer in the field: light forces fighting to prevent Russian armour encircling Kyiv. “Ukrainian operational security is very tight. We know very little about what they’re doing or how, by design,” said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare specialist from the Rusi thinktank. He said the strategy appears two pronged: to hold out in Kyiv and other major cities, and to try hit and run tactics elsewhere. “They are investing heavily in urban defence, particularly Kyiv, but in rural areas we’ve seen the military use ambush tactics against Russian convoys on roads, which will make it difficult for Russian forces to operate away from the road network without being detected or attacked by irregular forces”. Since the war began, what the UK and other western countries describe as “defensive weaponry” has been flooding into Ukraine, at least 17,000 anti-tank weapons and about 900 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. Arms are airlifted to Rzeszów in south-eastern Poland, now defended by a US Patriot battery, and being taken on by land thereafter, where supply routes to Kyiv at least remain open. And as the footage indicates, at least some Ukrainian forces have no shortage of shoulder-mounted arms for now. Yet it also shows what Ukraine lacks. It has no real match for Russian artillery, which has been remorselessly targeting Kharkiv and Mariupol in the east with grim consequences for civilians. And while Russian air power has been more absent by day – because, the UK says, the air force is worried about the threat of anti-aircraft missiles – it is able to run bombing missions at night. There were airstrikes overnight on Dnipro and on airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk in the west, which had been relatively peaceful. Ukraine seems to have no way to combat Russian artillery once it has bedded in and encircled, or nearly encircled, a city. “Offensively going after Russian artillery requires combat power that Ukrainian forces struggle to generate. Ukraine will probably be on the losing side of any traditional artillery duels that it gets into,” Reynolds said. It is a point not lost on Ukraine’s leadership. Knowing that Nato has repeatedly said no to a no-fly zone, Volodymyr Zelenskiy opted for different –and broader – plea in his address to British MPs this week. “Please ensure that our Ukrainian skies are safe,” the president said, carefully, referring both to aircraft and artillery. Yet the help required is not forthcoming. Britain has said it is now willing to supply anti-aircraft missiles and other countries are ready to send resupplies. But the west is not willing to supply heavy guns and tanks – or fighter jets that could help fend off Russian massed forces, after the US said it was not prepared to act as an intermediary and pass on 28 Polish MiG-29s. Such supplies, it is feared, would provoke Russia unnecessarily. Ukraine’s dominance of social media narrative also makes it easy to ignore Russian successes. In the last 24 hours Russia’s ministry of defence has released footage of Russian armour on the move near Kyiv. Other social media footage shows a captured Javelin anti-tank bazooka and Geneva-convention-breaking images of captured and humiliated Ukrainian prisoners. It is uncertain how long Kharkiv can hold out for, where 48 schools and a psychiatric hospital are said by local authorities to have been bombed. The situation is worse in Mariupol where 1,200 civilians are already said by the city’s authorities to have been killed and repeated attempts at evacuations have failed amid continuing shelling. “No electricity, water and gas supply. Meaning no means for heating,” warned a Red Cross worker as he described a desperate situation in the city on Thursday. This week the US estimated that 5,000 to 6,000 Russian troops had been killed and 2,000 to 4,000 Ukrainian troops, plus many more civilians. Another US assessment estimated that both sides had lost 8% to 10% of the military assets that they had committed to the fighting. Against such a backdrop looms the possibility of a bloody siege of Kyiv. Russian troops have been trying to encircle the city, which may explain why Ukrainian forces have been so keen to counterattack – to stave off the sort of shelling seen in the east. Yet an attempt by Russian forces to build up a force around Brovary, to the east of Kyiv, earlier this week was beaten back, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank monitoring the fighting. Video emerged on Thursday morning showing a Russian column, seemingly underestimating the danger, being attacked on the main E95 road outside Brovary. It was a crucial victory, leaving Russian forces only in control around the north-west and west of the capital, although it has longer-range Iskander and Kalibr missiles that could target Kyiv in numbers if it chose. Nevertheless Ukrainian counterattacks appear possible, at least for now, where Russian forces have overextended themselves. Whether they can continue if a city is roughly encircled appears far less less certain. This week Zelenskiy promised to “fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores in the streets”, but in reality Ukraine’s military plan appears to amount to sheer, bloody survival. “It is quite difficult to see what their strategy is, beyond holding the Russians out of major cities,” said Ben Barry, a land warfare specialist with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. In other words, such is the military imbalance that the principal hope for Ukraine is that the longer it can hold up, something will emerge to turn the tide.",News/World news,West’s weapons are seeing action in Ukraine – but it is unlikely to be enough,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/west-weapons-seeing-action-ukraine-but-unlikely-enough-russia-war
3/12/2022,"More than two centuries after Samuel Taylor Coleridge awoke from a drug-addled reverie – if the story is to be totally believed – to pen his great poem Kubla Khan, the only version of the work in the writer’s own hand has returned to the corner of south-west England that inspired him. The unique manuscript is the centrepiece of a new exhibition on Coleridge at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton, close to the hills and valleys he and William Wordsworth roamed at the end of the 18th century. Experts hailed it as a chance to re-examine the story behind the poem, which has become almost as famous as the piece itself, and a reminder of the fundamental role Somerset played in the Romantic movement, which is overshadowed by the impact the Lake District had on Wordsworth. Alexandra Ault, a lead curator at the British Library who is supervising the loan of the manuscript, said she was excited to see it on display in Somerset. “It’s so amazing,” she said. “This is the only known manuscript of Kubla Khan written in Coleridge’s hand, but it does so much more than that. It raises as many questions as it answers. Bringing it to Somerset makes us think about Coleridge again and ask questions about him and the poem.” At the end of the 18th century, Coleridge lived for three years at in a draughty, mouse-infested cottage in Nether Stowey, north of Taunton, where he wrote some of his most renowned poems including The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and worked with Wordsworth on their collection of poetry Lyrical Ballads. According to Coleridge, Kubla Khan was created in a farmhouse in the Somerset hamlet of Culbone on the seaward slopes of Exmoor in the autumn of 1797. He claimed he was on one of his long rambles when he suffered an upset stomach. Resting in a farmhouse, he said he took two grains of opium and fell into a reverie during which the fantastical world of Xanadu – the “stately pleasure dome”, the “caverns measureless to man” – emerged. He woke and began writing the poem down but was interrupted by “a person on business from Porlock” [a town on the Somerset coast], which broke his flow, leaving him with only a “fragment” of the world that had appeared to him. Ault said the Taunton exhibition was a chance to revisit this story. “Did he really fall asleep and was he really woken by someone from Porlock or did he cook this up when the poem was published later [in 1816] on to make it all seem more fantastical? “We don’t really know when Coleridge first penned Kubla Khan. We don’t have the first drafts. What we have is this fair copy. Let’s not accept Coleridge’s story, let’s look again.” Ault said this manuscript – written in iron gall ink on blue notepaper – may have been written several years later for a Gloucestershire collector who had it in her possession by about 1804. The manuscript was sold after her death and was acquired by the British Library in 1962. Tom Mayberry, the chief executive of the South West Heritage Trust, said it was a vivid reminder of an extraordinary time in English literature. “This was the moment when Coleridge and Wordsworth gave a new voice to English poetry. In Lyrical Ballads they created one of the foundation stones of English Romantic literature and Kubla Khan stands out as the strangest and most marvellous of all the poems that emerged from that time in Somerset.” Other treasures on display in Taunton include a mahogany writing table used by Coleridge, a bible he preached from at the local Unitarian chapel and a rare edition of Lyrical Ballads. “Somerset can be forgotten in that story of the Romantic poets,” said Mayberry. “Clearly for Wordsworth the Lake District was profound but what he and Coleridge achieved in Somerset was a turning point in their lives and in literature.” It is the last chance to see the Kubla Khan manuscript for a while. Blue paper loses its colour so after its sojourn in Somerset it will be returned to the British Library and rested away from the public gaze.

3/12/2022,"A rodent that lives on the plains of Inner Mongolia fells tall grasses so that it can scan the skies for flying predators, a study involving experts from the University of Exeter has found. The practice by Brandt’s voles also means that shrikes, a type of carnivorous bird, are denied handy perches and places to use as larders for their prey, the study discovered. Scientists from Exeter and universities in China and the US have established that the voles cut tall bunchgrass when shrikes, also known as butcher birds, were nearby. The voles do not eat the bunchgrass, but were observed to manage it as a means of self-preservation, an example of “ecosystem engineering”. “When shrikes were present, the voles dramatically decreased the volume of bunchgrass,” said Dirk Sanders of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the university’s Penryn campus in Cornwall. “This led to fewer visits from shrikes, which apparently recognise cut-grass areas as poor hunting grounds. An activity like this is costly for the voles in terms of energy so cutting the grass must significantly improve their chances of survival.” The voles attack the bottom parts of the stem and leaves and dropped them on the ground. They also dig burrows that lead to the roots being cut. Researchers tested the impact of keeping the predators away by putting up nets over certain areas. With no shrikes overhead, the voles stopped cutting the bunchgrass. Other examples of ecosystem engineering include elephants opening up areas of African savanna and fish off the Catalan coast reducing the canopy height of seagrass, but these make areas safer for other species rather than their own. Shrikes often perch on the branches and stems of shrubs and tall grasses to search for prey such as voles and large insects. They store their food by impaling their prey on a thorn or a stem, as if storing food on a meat hook. “We sometimes underestimate the ability of wild animals to react to changes in their environment,” Sanders said. “In this case, the voles were able to change their behaviour in response to the removal of predators. “Our findings are a reminder that species show remarkable adaptations. It also underlines that the loss of even a single species in a food web can result in unexpected changes to an entire habitat.” The paper is published in the journal Current Biology, entitled “A rodent herbivore reduces its predation risk”.",News/Science,"Mongolian rodent fells tall grass to foil predators, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/11/mongolian-rodent-brandts-vole-trims-tall-grass-to-foil-predators-study-finds
3/12/2022,"At an Oval Office meeting with then Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko in 2017, Donald Trump asked his national security adviser if US troops were in Donbas, territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists, which Vladimir Putin last month used as pretext for a full and bloody invasion. Describing the meeting in a new book, the then US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, writes: “An affirmative answer to that question would have meant that the United States was in a shooting war with Russia.” Yovanovitch adds: “I pondered whether it was better to interpret Trump’s question as suggesting that the commander-in-chief thought it possible that US troops were fighting Russia-led forces, or instead as an indicator that the president wasn’t clear which country was on the other side of the war against Ukraine. “Either way, it was disconcerting that he did not seem to know where we had our troops – his troops – deployed. I could only imagine what the Ukrainians were thinking.” Trump fired Yovanovitch in 2019, amid attempts to withhold military aid to Ukraine in return for political dirt on Joe Biden and other rivals, an affair which fueled Trump’s first impeachment. Yovanovitch describes the Trump-Poroshenko meeting in Lessons from the Edge: A Memoir, which will be published on Tuesday. The Guardian obtained a copy. The book comes three weeks into the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which followed years of proxy warfare in the east of the country. Yovanovitch also writes that Trump told Poroshenko Ukraine “was a corrupt country, which he knew because a Ukrainian friend at Mar-a-Lago had told him”. Trump, she says, also said: “Crimea was Russian, as the locals spoke Russian”. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a move never recognized by the international community. Yovanovitch writes that Trump’s words were “surprising enough to hear from one head of state to another” but Trump topped them by asking his national security adviser, HR McMaster, whether US troops were in Donbas. “Everyone kept a poker face on,” she writes. Echoing descriptions of Trump’s favored working techniques by multiple close aides, Yovanovitch says Poroshenko deployed “visual aids, which Trump really liked” as he “ably pushed back” and made his case for support. Poroshenko requested the inclusion of Javelin anti-tank missiles in a package of security aide. Trump seemed open to the idea, Yovanovitch writes. In 2019, however, news broke of his attempt to withhold military aide and secure dirt on Biden. Yovanovitch’s book comes as Poroshenko’s successor, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, leads his country’s fight against Russian invaders, his forces using US-supplied Javelins and other weapons sent by allies. The Poroshenko meeting was brief and forms a small part of a book which tells Yovanovitch’s story of machinations involving Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s attorney, which led to her firing and Trump’s impeachment. But her description of the meeting echoes others by sources including John Bolton, McMaster’s successor as national security adviser, which have shown Trump risking embarrassment and mishap when one-on-one with world leaders. Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, recently revealed that Trump risked disaster in an early meeting with his counterpart Reuven Rivlin, when he praised the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas and criticized Benjamin Netanyahu, then the Israeli prime minister, for being unwilling to seek peace. Trump’s comments “knocked everyone off their chairs”, Friedman wrote. Participants in the meeting with Poroshenko appear to have stayed seated. Yovanovitch writes that she sensed “Trump had come into the meeting viewing Ukraine as a ‘loser’ country, smaller and weaker than Russia”, only to be “a little surprised by Poroshenko”, who was “as physically imposing as Trump” and who was also “a billionaire businessman”. After the meeting, Trump said Ukraine was “a place that everybody’s been reading about”. Poroshenko told reporters he was “satisfied with the results of the negotiations”, and said the two leaders discussed military and technical cooperation. Yovanovitch “hoped that Poroshenko had created the kind of favorable impression that would make Trump rethink his views of Ukraine and its importance to our strategic interests”. However, she adds, “Trump’s obsequiousness toward Putin was a frequent and continuing cause for concern”. In 2018, Trump staged an infamous summit with Putin in Helsinki at which the two men spoke in private for close to two hours. Trump’s “toadying up” to Putin at the press conference which followed, Yovanovitch writes, made her lose her appetite. “When the Ukrainian media called,” she writes, “ … we took the opportunity to reinforce the point that US policy was to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression”. Five years on from Trump’s meeting with Poroshenko, with Ukraine in a fight for its existence, Trump seems not entirely to have shed his suspicion that US troops could be in the country – a step the Biden administration has made clear will not be taken, given the potentially huge cost of confrontation with Russia. Last month, Trump appeared to misunderstand a Fox News host, to the extent of believing Americans troops had landed in Ukraine. “You shouldn’t be saying that, because you and everybody else shouldn’t know about it,” the former president said, seemingly mistaking reports of Russian troop movements for US ones. “They should do that secretly, not be doing that through the great Laura Ingraham.” “No, those are the Russians,” Ingraham corrected him. “Oh, I thought you said that we were sending people in,” Trump said. “That’ll be next.”",Arts/Books,Trump told former Ukrainian president ‘Crimea was Russian’,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/11/donald-trump-ukraine-crimea-russia-poroshenko-book
3/12/2022,"As a longtime activist and co-founder of Black Voters Matter, and because I lived in Selma, Alabama, for about 10 years, I’ve participated in many Bloody Sunday and Selma to Montgomery commemorations. But this time, it feels a little different. This is the first time after the renewed battle for federal voting rights legislation, which we have fought for throughout 2021 starting with our fight against Georgia’s voter suppression bill early in the year, and continuing with similar efforts in Florida as well as Texas, where activists and legislators successfully delayed a voter suppression bill for six months. In a series of actions involving non-violent civil disobedience, I was arrested five times, including one arrest which resulted in an overnight stay in a DC jail. This movement eventually led to the historic Senate debate and unsuccessful vote this past January. In the aftermath of all of this, returning to Selma for the Bridge Crossing Jubilee takes on even more meaning than usual. This is also the first time I am participating after being diagnosed with two forms of cancer in 2021. I’m now immunocompromised, constantly exposing myself to crowds. If I’m feeling tired, or if I feel an ache in my back, I wonder, Is this because I walked multiple miles or participated in a four-hour rally, or is this something related to my health condition? I’m battling cancer, and I’m battling against a wave of state-level voter restrictions upheld by the supreme court and Senate inaction that would turn back the clock on voters rights. Over the past week Black Voters Matter joined local and national partners, each responsible for organizing a leg of the 54 miles from Selma to Montgomery. We are determined to continue the work of a generation of freedom fighters who came before us. It is the Sunday of the Bridge Crossing Jubilee, and at 5 this morning it took me longer than usual to get dressed. Usually for events, I put on my trusted jogging pants, “Black voters matter” hoodie and hat, with my Black voters matter shoes and I am out the door. Today would be different, partly because of the nature of this anniversary, but also because I would be sharing the stage with the vice-president of the United States, as a leader of a national social justice organization that played a central role in fighting for voting rights this year. So my usual “uniform” remained in the closet, and I reluctantly grabbed a suit, but true to my activist heart, the Black voters matter hat punctuated the outfit because, as my staff will tell you, I always want to send a message that Black voters matter, even when I am not saying a word. Vice-president Kamala Harris attended the bridge crossing, but we didn’t have time for a conversation beyond, “nice to meet you”; I would have loved to have discussed the future of voting rights, or even the economic development needs in Selma, but today would not be that day. That experience is symbolic of what the Selma commemoration has become – a multi-day photo op. As someone who has access to folks with national influence and access to resources, I feel a responsibility to voice the frustrations of this community which gave so much to this country but has received so little in return. On this day, I didn’t, and even though I know it was more a function of limited access than a personal failing, I still can’t help but feel like I fell short. The Poor People’s Campaign, Transformative Justice Coalition and Rainbow Push Coalition coordinated the first day of the Selma to Montgomery march (not counting the Sunday bridge crossing). I wanted to attend along with some of our BVM team to show support for these three organizations, which have been deeply involved in the battle for voting rights legislation, but I also wanted to attend to assess Covid protocols and the ever-present problem of threats. We generally do a good job planning for this as we travel the country in the Blackest bus in America, which attracts its fair share of attention from racists in many states, especially in more rural counties. In light of conservative extremists using vehicles as weapons, like in Charlottesville, we take safety at marches very seriously. All went well today, but the safety concerns will always linger. Instead of participating in day two of the march, I spoke at a press conference in downtown Montgomery organized by the Alabama chapter of the League of Women Voters to raise awareness about a proposed bill that could eliminate the ability for voter mobilization organizations to register voters or assist with vote by mail. That evening, BVM hosted a dinner with our funding partners to advocate for extra resources in Alabama’s Blackbelt. Driving home from the dinner (where I ended up pulling clean-up duty), I received a phone call about a safety concern that sent my mind on a whole new iteration of asking whether there was something I’d overlooked. My mind spiraled into thinking about tomorrow, the day BVM was in charge of organizing. Will we stay on schedule? Will college students feel the trip to join us was worth their time? Will our political objectives be met? Those questions stayed on my mind all night. It started off kind of shaky when I woke up at around 4am, not intentionally but probably because of that nervousness you feel when you want to make sure you’re not oversleeping when you’ve got something important to do. I ended up using that time to to think about what I wanted to say when it was time to speak to the crowd to get everyone fired up to march. Our BVM team loaded our bus on schedule and we arrived at the starting point right on time. When we arrived I thought, this doesn’t look like the 600 people we were expecting. I tried not to worry about it. With a combination of freedom songs, racial justice chants, and a DJ playing a rotation of old school and current jams geared towards our college-aged marchers, we ended up picking up more marchers along the way, totaling close to 800 throughout the day. It was a mix of protest march and a moving block party all rolled into one. By the time we reached the end of the nine miles BVM was in charge of organizing, marchers shouted out, “Let’s keep going”and “let’s go back and do it again!” It’s important to know they enjoyed it because the presence of Black joy, Black culture and Black love has always been important for sustaining our movements. I was excited that BVM’s nine-mile leg of the march went through historic Lowndes county – a part of Alabama’s Blackbelt region that helped shape my activism – so I could highlight its role in the voting rights movement and ongoing battles over sewerage problems that affect the health of residents there. For me, a highlight today was when one of the four “foot soldiers” – residents of Lowndes county who had participated in the 1965 march and/or were evicted from their houses and lived in “tent city” – made us laugh, cry and took us to church, all within her five-minute speech. As I told the audience when the group finished speaking, the history they shared today was absolutely priceless! If one of our objectives for the day was to have participants gain a better understanding of Lowndes county and for Lowndes county to feel valued and appreciated, that mission was definitely accomplished. Often during our movement, we sing, “I woke up this morning with my mind, stayed on freedom!” Well, I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on a helluva back ache! Nevertheless, I had to go back to pass the torch to our friends from labor union organizations who coordinated Thursday’s leg of the march. I was intending to simply make a few remarks, then pass the torch, since I knew my body wouldn’t let me do another nine miles. But, next thing you know, we were two miles into the march! My wife convinced me to take a ride back to our car. I’m writing this Thursday night, back in my hotel room, getting ready for the final day tomorrow, when the march ends in Montgomery, which is being coordinated by our friends at the Legal Defense Fund. It ends at the capitol building, the same end point for the 1965 march where Dr King gave his famous “How Long?” speech, a speech that I have referenced a couple of times during our rallies last year. I’ll be one of the speakers at the rally tomorrow. I can only pray that whatever I say will be worth someone quoting 57 years later. But more importantly, my hope is that what I and others say tomorrow, what we’ve done this week, and the plans that our coalition is putting in place for the rest of the year, result in the passage of voting rights legislation. This week has been about strengthening our movement so that we can move beyond fighting against voter suppression to fighting for the broader vision of racial justice and the type of society that we truly deserve. We still have a lot more bridges to cross, and many more miles to march. And I’ll be there.

3/12/2022,"Georgia lawmakers are trying to pass a bill that would ban discussions of gender identity and sexual orientation in private schools, introducing the measure the same day the Florida senate passed its so-called “don’t say gay” bill. Under Georgia’s new bill, the Common Humanity in Private Education Act, no private school classroom would be able to “promote, compel, or encourage classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not appropriate for the age and developmental stage of the student,” reported NBC. Proponents of the measure say that it promotes parental rights and inclusion in their children’s education, but LGBTQ+ advocates argue that the bill is another example of attacks on LGBTQ+ youth happening nationwide. “We know it’s not about parental rights,” said Jeff Graham, the executive director of the LGBTQ advocacy group Georgia Equality, to NBC. “It really is about restricting the activities, participation and learning of children in school.” Compared to Florida’s bill, Georgia’s measure focuses exclusively on private schools, though critics of the measure have argued that the bill’s wording could also include all publicly funded programs. While the bill has little chance of passing soon, given how late it was introduced into Georgia’s legislative session, opponents of the bill worry that its introduction now could energize Republicans ahead of elections in the fall. Current discussions of the bill could also set the stage for more serious consideration next year. In addition to Florida and Georgia, several other states have introduced or passed bills in recent months marginalizing LGBTQ+ people. Iowa governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill last Thursday that banned trans girls and women from participating in high school and college athletics, despite arguments that the bill was discriminatory and targeted a non-existent problem. In Tennessee, Republicans advanced legislation on Tuesday that would ban public schools from using textbooks that “promote, normalize, support or address LGBT issues or lifestyles” in K-12 classrooms, reported the Associated Press. Kansas Republicans introduced a bill last month that would make it a class B misdemeanor to teach classroom materials on “homosexuality,” changing the state’s current obscenity laws, reports NBC. Outside of anti-LGBTQ+ laws targeting school activity, several states have introduced marginalizing laws or directives that prosecute outside of the classroom. In Texas, Republican governor Greg Abbott instructed the state’s child protection services to investigate any parents providing their children with gender-affirming care, accusing them of “abuse.” Tennessee, Iowa, and Oklahoma are some of the states currently considering the most pieces of anti-LGBTQ legislation, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, reported CNN.",News/US news,Outcry as Georgia lawmakers aim to pass Florida-style ‘don’t say gay’ bill ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/georgia-florida-dont-say-gill-bill-legislation
3/12/2022,"Films about dysfunctional families often call to mind Tolstoy’s line from the opening of Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” It struck me that the opposite might be true watching this thoughtful, gentle debut from the Portuguese visual artist Catarina Vasconcelos: a lyrical, introspective love letter to her family, gorgeously shot on 16mm. It’s a kind of fictionalised art documentary that for the first hour or so is essentially about Vasconcelos’s grandparents’ life together. It begins with her elderly grandfather Henrique (played by José Manuel Mendes) moving into residential care. In voiceover Henrique talks tenderly to his wife, Beatriz, who died of a stroke in 1984. He was a sailor by trade, away at sea for long stretches of married life; he missed births and milestones, and didn’t meet one of his daughters until she was four. We watch a dramatisation of their marriage; Beatriz talks as well; so too do other members of the family, including their eldest son Jacinto, the director’s father. To her family Beatriz is a tree, a practical woman with deep roots. For her, the children are like birds, who will fly away in time. This poetic voiceover is pierced with an ache of longing and loss. And it’s a film of extraordinary, beautifully composed images, each one like a painting itself: the strong capable hands of the family’s maid cutting a squash or closeups of the veins on a leaf. In the second section, Vasconcelos focuses on the loss of her own mother in 2003. In a tremendously moving scene, she keeps on screen a photo taken at her birth, the blissful moment her mother saw her for the first time. Over the top, her dad talks about watching her at 17 arriving at hospital to find her mother dead. The film isn’t really concerned with any bigger truths or issues but it will no doubt be treasured by the Vasconceloses; others may feel that it is a long time to watch the story of someone else’s family, however gently and poetically told.

3/12/2022,"Cricket and theatre have long been intimate bedfellows. Stroll round Lord’s on a Test match day and you meet more actors than at an Equity AGM. Playwrights from Beckett and Pinter to Rattigan and Hare have been drawn to the game for obvious reasons: that cricket, like drama, is a formalised ritual pulsating with subtext. That is palpably true of the latest cricket play, I Don’t Think We’ve Met, written by Ian Smith, an academic and ex-captain of Pinter’s team, The Gaieties It was given a one-off performance this week at a London dinner emcee’d by Graham Gooch: an extraordinary event that was about a lot more than the game itself. Smith’s subject is the great cricketer Colin Cowdrey, who, as a batsman, was a model of elegance: in my favourite cricket book, Australia 55, Alan Ross wrote of the young Cowdrey that “he placed and drove the ball to the on with a distribution of balance that would have delighted Michelangelo”. But Smith’s starting point is the way Cowdrey, in his early forties, was summoned at short notice to join an England team plagued by injuries on the Australia tour of 1974. This triggers Cowdrey’s reminiscences of his whole career, including his first tour of Australia under his admired captain Len Hutton, and the torrid time he endured in the West Indies in 1959-60 and 1963 facing the fast bowling of Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. “What do they of cricket know who only cricket know?” CLR James famously asked, and Smith’s play inevitably becomes about something more than Cowdrey’s heroics at the crease. I see it as a celebration of a chivalric courtesy rapidly becoming outmoded in an age of commercial opportunism. In one of the key scenes, Cowdrey is invited in 1974 by the England captain, Tony Greig, to join a breakaway Players’ Association that will vastly increase the earning power of cricketers. Rejecting Greig’s blandishments, Cowdrey quietly replies: “I’ve always played for more than what I’m paid.” On his return home in 1975, Cowdrey is dismayed to learn that his friend Ted Heath is being replaced as leader of the Conservative party by Margaret Thatcher, which will eventually lead to an even more profound elevation of the profit-motive. You could argue that the comfortably-off Cowdrey didn’t have to worry about money. But the play is really about the public virtue, and the professional cost, of Cowdrey’s innate good manners. What makes the play moving is that the role of Colin Cowdrey is played by his son, Chris. Although he regularly hosts public events, Chris has no acting experience but seems to have inherited the familial modesty: he told me that people constantly tell him that he resembles his father – except when he’s playing cricket. Ian Smith skilfully voices a variety of characters, including Tony Greig, Peter May and John Arlott, and Stephanie Tripp both plays Mrs Cowdrey and provides the svelte narration. As for the title of the play – which would be a perfect fit for Radio 4 – it derives from a famous encounter in Australia in 1974 when the newly arrived Cowdrey, on going out to bat. politely introduced himself to the fast bowler Jeff Thomson, by saying, “I don’t think we’ve met – I’m Colin Cowdrey,” to which Thomson elegantly replied, “That’s not going to help you, fatso. Now piss off.”",Arts/Stage,I Don’t Think We’ve Met celebrates a golden age of cricketing chivalry | Michael Billington,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/11/i-dont-think-weve-met-celebrate-ian-smith-colin-cowdrey
