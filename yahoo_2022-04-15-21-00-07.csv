4/15/2022,"The Transportation Security Administration has nothing on the security guards manning the entrance at Drai's Beach Club. Within seconds of peering into a small black clutch, they found contraband. The Tic Tacs, they said, had to go. The small white mints are just one of the hundreds of items that have found themselves on dayclubs' mile-long list of prohibited items. The pools' lists include many items that are often floating around in a purse or pocket. No gum. No nasal spray. No over-the-counter medication and, at some clubs, no prescription medication. ONE WEEKEND, 10 VEGAS POOL PARTIES: $50 cocktails, long lines for Snoop Dogg and twerking in thongs HEADING TO A LAS VEGAS POOL PARTY?: Don't make these rookie dayclub mistakes ""I actually have to take medication twice a day,"" said Laura Hill, an Australian who was pool hopping in Las Vegas this month. ""I just take it in the morning and night, I didn't bring it with me. But I'm like man, if I had to have that with me, that would suck."" Hill added that she also often carries eye drops – another item on many pools' no-no list. How strictly these rules are enforced varies; one USA TODAY reporter was able to get into Daylight Beach Club, a pool at Mandalay Bay, with a smartwatch despite the pool's ""no wearable technology"" rule. LAS VEGAS POOL PARTY ESSENTIALS: Details on admission, security and drink prices at Encore, Drai’s and 8 more Many of the dayclubs note that their online lists are not exhaustive, so guests should be prepared for security to stop them from entering with items that may not be listed. Visitors can usually find extensive lists of prohibited items and dress codes on a dayclub's website or on signage near the entrance. A number of dayclubs – including Wet Republic Ultra Pool at MGM Grand, Wynn's Encore Beach Club, Ayu Beach Club at Resorts World and Virgin Hotel Las Vegas' Elia Beach Club – do not allow jeans of any sort, according to their websites. Elia, Stadium Swim at Circa, Ayu and Encore go as far as saying no pants of any kind are allowed. Other common types of apparel that are banned include athletic wear, baggy clothing, ripped or torn clothing, robes, tank tops, baseball caps and excessive chains and jewelry. Guests at Drai's Beachclub at the Cromwell should also leave their Speedos at home. The fashion faux pas of wearing socks with sandals is also outright banned at Wet Republic and Elia. The perfect selfie angle is going to be harder to find at certain pools with selfie stick bans. Tao Group Hospitality's Las Vegas dayclubs (Wet Republic, Liquid Pool Lounge at Aria, Tao Beach Dayclub at The Venetian and Marquee Dayclub at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas), Stadium Swim and Drai's forbid the device. Have eye drops in your purse? You'll have to toss it before entering Drai's, Elia, Daylight Beach Club at Mandalay Bay or Stadium Swim at Circa. Daylight also includes contact lens solution cleaner, liquid hand sanitizer and tissues on its online list of prohibited items. Elia has banned perfumes, hairsprays, tanning sprays and nasal sprays, according to its website. Over-the-counter medication is not allowed inside Elia, Daylight, Liquid, Marquee, Stadium Swim, Tao and Wet Republic. Some pools (Elia and Daylight) ban all medications, even those that are prescribed. Stadium Swim does not allow more than one daily dose of a prescribed medication, according to signage near the pool area. Daylight's website says both prescription and nonprescription medicine fall under its zero-tolerance policy for drugs. Guests are advised to take the proper dosage before arrival. The dayclub notes that diabetic kits, EpiPens and inhalers are acceptable with ""proper documentation."" Drai's at the Cromwell and Daylight at Mandalay Bay and Stadium Swim at Circa say wearable technology is not allowed. Stadium Swim notes that it does allow smartwatches, though. Encore Beach Club at Wynn's website says the pool has the right to decline entry to or remove guests with ""excessive or extreme"" tattoos, body modifications or jewelry. Signage at Circa's Stadium Swim also says the property reserves the right to decline entry to or remove guests with ""excessive, offensive or extreme tattoos or body modifications."" All liquids are banned at Liquid, Wet Republic, Marquee, Tao, Drai's and Elia Beach Club. Elia Beach Club also forbids liquid makeup. The concierge desk at Circa says each Stadium Swim guest can bring one sealed water bottle. Dayclubs do enforce this rule; USA TODAY reporters were told they could not enter Wet Republic at MGM Grand with the small water bottles their pool party tour bus handed out just minutes before. Bags at Elia and Daylight must be smaller than 8.5-by-11 inches. Guests should also be prepared to pay to store their bag in a locker. Bag checks at dayclubs visited by USA TODAY reporters the week of April 1 ranged from $20 to $75 per day. Tao Hospitality Group prohibits signs larger than 11-by-17 inches or attached to a pole or stick at its dayclubs, according to its website. Elia notes that no ""weapons of any kind"" that can be used to cause bodily harm are allowed. This includes pens and pencils.

4/15/2022,"(Adds details, quotes) April 15 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry said on Friday it had struck a military target on the edge of Kyiv overnight with cruise missiles and promised more strikes against the Ukrainian capital in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian targets. The ministry said its forces had also taken full control of the Ilyich Steel Plant in the besieged port city of Mariupol, which has been encircled by Russian troops for weeks. Powerful explosions were heard in Kyiv on Friday which appeared to be among the most significant there since Russian troops pulled back from the area earlier this month in preparation for battles in the south and east. The explosions were reported to have been heard after the Russian defence ministry announced that the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, had sunk while being towed after being badly damaged. Ukraine claimed the Moskva's damage was the result of one of its missile strikes. Russia's defence ministry spoke only of a fire breaking out and of exploding ammunition. The defence ministry said in its statement that its overnight missile strikes on Kyiv had struck the 'Vizar' factory on the edge of the Ukrainian capital which it said made and repaired missiles, including anti-ship missiles. It pledged more strikes on Kyiv. ""The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime,"" the ministry said in a statement. It said its forces had shot down a Ukrainian Mi-8 helicopter which it said had attacked the village of Klimovo in Bryansk region on April 14 and had also shot down a Ukrainian Sukhoi-27 jet. A group of up to 30 Polish mercenaries had also been destroyed, it said. Russia launched what it calls its ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24. Ukraine has put up fierce resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia.

4/15/2022,"Tracy Gaeta, 54, was shot and killed by a Stockton police officer after backing her car into a police vehicle, reported NBC News. Lawyers for her family say the officer used excessive force and that she never threatened anyone nor was she armed.
 K-9 officer Kyle Ribera fired more than 30 shots into her car Feb. 22. The body camera footage of the incident was released April 7. The police department said the incident began when Gaeta was seen on surveillance striking a police SUV at a red light. She was pursued by Ribera, stopped at a dead end and backed into his car.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce More on the incident from NBC News: According to the body camera video, Ribera then fired 18 shots into Gaeta’s car. Her vehicle’s reverse lights remained on, and Ribera fired several more shots. After changing his service weapon’s clip, Ribera yelled for the driver to raise their hands, according to the video. Gaeta began driving, pulling forward several feet, then reversing away from Ribera. He opened fire again, shooting more than a dozen times, according to the video. Gaeta was taken to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead, the department said. According to a policy adopted by the Stockton Police Department in 2019, officers are “generally” prohibited from firing at fleeing vehicles. Gaeta’s family attorney Gary Gwilliam said the officer acted against the department policies on firing at moving vehicles. “No matter what was going on with her — even if she had committed a heinous crime — he didn’t have the right to shoot her. She never threatened him,” he said via NBC. A spokesman from the Stockton Police Department told NBC News a review of the incident was underway which will end in a decision by the local district attorney’s office on whether to place criminal charges against Ribera. Gaeta’s daughter, Tressie, called her a “loving, caring grandmother” in a statement from Gwilliam’s office. “I hope that we can find justice because she did not deserve to die like that,” she said.",U.S./The Root,California Woman Killed After Stockton Police Officer Fired 30 Shots Into Her Car,https://news.yahoo.com/california-woman-killed-stockton-police-141809107.html
