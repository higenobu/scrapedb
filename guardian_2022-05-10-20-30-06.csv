5/10/2022,"Grindr plans to float through a merger with a so-called Spac investment company in a deal that values the gay dating app at $2.1bn (£1.7bn). The app will receive $384m as part of the deal with Tiga Acquisition Corp (TAC), the Singapore-based special purpose acquisition company (Spac) – also known as a “blank cheque” shell company that raises money first and seeks businesses to buy later. Grindr, which launched in 2009 and specialises in dating among the LGBTQ+ community, had 10.8 million monthly active users last year. Of these 723,000 paid for one of its subscription services, called Xtra and Unlimited, with paying users up 31% over 2020. The average amount of time users spend on the app each day hit 61 minutes in December and 80% of profiles on Grindr are 35 years old or younger – with just 11% aged 41 or older – according to the company’s investor presentation. The company’s revenues rose 30% last year to $147m – and it expects growth of between 35% and 40% this year – and made $77m in adjusted profits. The valuation is more than triple the $608m that owner San Vicente Acquisition paid for Grindr two years ago. Grindr said that as part of the deal, which will result in existing shareholders owning about 78% of the company, the chief executive, Jeff Bonforte, would step down. “It has been the longstanding goal of Grindr’s current ownership and management that Grindr be led by members of the LGBTQ+ community,” the company said in a statement announcing the deal. “Working together, Grindr’s board and management have identified and been in discussions with a potential new chief executive officer candidate who would bring a depth and breadth of experience across technology, finance, and management, including time spent in an executive leadership role at a public company.” Grindr, which is based in West Hollywood, California, and Tiga said the deal may require clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets deals for potential national security risks. In 2019, CFIUS ordered the Chinese gaming company Kunlun Tech Co, then owner of Grindr, to sell the company over concerns that personal data of US users could be accessed and used by China’s government. The company sold Grindr a year later for $608m. The deal means Grindr will join the much larger $20bn Match group, which owns dating brands including Tinder and Hinge and has about 100 million users in total, and Bumble, which has about 40 million users, as publicly listed dating apps.",News/Business,Gay dating app Grindr to float in $2.1bn deal,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/10/gay-dating-app-grindr-float-spac-deal

5/10/2022,"US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has built a massive digital surveillance system that gives it access to the personal details of almost every person in America, a two-year investigation by Georgetown University law center has found. Researchers from the Center on Privacy & Technology on Tuesday released one of the most comprehensive reviews of Ice activities, concluding that the federal organisation has strayed well beyond its duties as an immigration body to become what is in effect a domestic surveillance agency. Operating largely in secret and with minimal public oversight, Ice has amassed a formidable armory of digital capabilities that allows its agents to “pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time”. The vast mountain of data to which Ice now has access includes: Driver’s license data for three of every four adults living in the US Data drawn from the utility records of 75% of adults, covering more than 218m unique utility consumers in all 50 states Information on the movements of drivers in cities that contain 75% of the US population Facial recognition technology drawn from the driver’s license photos of at least a third of all adults The Georgetown researchers base their report, American Dragnet: Data-Driven Deportation in the 21st Century, on hundreds of freedom of information requests and a review of more than 100,000 previously unseen Ice spending transactions. The documents reveal the extent to which the agency’s surveillance has expanded beyond sharing information with law enforcement to exploiting an array of public and private databases. The agency operates an enormous dragnet of information stored by state and local government, utility companies, social media platforms and private data brokers. The end result is that Ice enjoys almost universal reach, with its intelligence weaponised through the use of powerful algorithmic tools for searching and analysing data. Almost all of that activity, the report points out, is done in the absence of warrants and in secret, beyond the purview of federal and state authorities. The scale of Ice surveillance shocked even the report’s authors. “I was alarmed to discover just how easily federal immigration agents can pull detailed records from the most intimate corners of all our lives,” Nina Wang, a policy associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology and a report author, told the Guardian. She added: “In its attempts to target an ever-growing number of people for detention and deportation, Ice has reached into the private homes and lives of almost every person in America.” Wang said the immigration agency now had an unfettered ability to “trace the movement of your vehicle on the roads, look up your address from your water or electricity bills, and conduct face recognition searches on your ID photos, all without needing a search warrant. “These tactics open massive side doors around existing privacy protections, and many lawmakers still have no idea.” Ice was created in 2003, in the febrile post-9/11 era. Initially it focused on mining the intelligence-gathering potential of the criminal justice system, operating a scheme known as S-Comm in which digital fingerprint data was shared with it by federal, state and local law enforcement. Since then, Ice has increasingly resorted to databases compiled by non-law enforcement entities as a way of widening its dragnet. The Georgetown researchers suggest the motivation was partly to increase the number of deportations of undocumented people and partly as part of the US government’s “larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives”. The center’s review of Ice spending from 2008 to last year revealed that overall investment in new surveillance infrastructure increased fivefold from about $71m to $388m. In that period, Ice spent more than $1.3bn on geolocation technology, including contracts with private companies that own license plate scanning databases. A further $96m was spent on biometrics, largely face recognition databases; $97m on private data brokers that gather data on individuals from a range of different sources including more than 80 utility companies; and a staggering $569m on data analysis just to be able to comb through the mammoth quantities of intelligence Ice now had within its grasp. Approximately $189m was paid to Palantir Technologies, the tech company co-founded and chaired by the Trump-supporting billionaire Peter Thiel. The money went towards custom-built programs created by Palantir to allow Ice agents to link public and private databases so that they could, in the center’s words, “visualise an interconnected web of data pulled from nearly every part of an individual’s life”. The researchers found a woefully inadequate response from federal and state authorities in terms of privacy protection. Congress, for instance, has yet to hold a full oversight hearing on Ice surveillance. One of the most disturbing aspects of the Ice surveillance system is how it has been used to skirt controls introduced by cities and states and designed to protect communities from precisely these kind of intrusive searches. After many legislatures introduced so-called “sanctuary” policies that prevented police forces working with Ice agents to facilitate deportations, Ice simply sidestepped the restrictions by finding other channels through which it could acquire intelligence, including through DMVs, private data brokers and utility companies.",News/World news,"US immigration agency operates vast surveillance dragnet, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/us-immigration-agency-ice-domestic-surveillance-study
5/10/2022,"Feeling that you just can’t win when it comes to the Daily Mail presumably comes with the territory if you are Labour leader, but Keir Starmer could be forgiven for thinking his treatment is particularly unfair. “Starmer accused of piling pressure on police,” the paper’s front-page headline said on Tuesday, directly below a red banner saying, “Beergate: Day 13”, a tally of how many days, some might argue, the paper has been trying to persuade Starmer to do exactly what he has now done. The Labour leader’s decision to pledge that he would resign if issued with a penalty over an April campaign event in Durham last year, where he was pictured holding a beer, “placed detectives in the difficult position” of knowing their decision would have major political ramifications, the Mail story warned. One unnamed government source said “ministers were concerned that Sir Keir’s intervention could place ‘undue pressure’ on Durham Constabulary to clear Sir Keir, or at least refrain from fining him”. A separate editorial comment from the paper said, in typically steadfast style, that Starmer’s televised statement announcing the decision “combined lawyerly weasel words with trademark sanctimony”. In a section that seemingly hints at a lack of contact between those writing the editorials and the team in charge of news, the comment added: “Superficially of course, he appears to be doing the decent thing, though frankly, he didn’t have much choice.” The lack of choice would arguably be the message regular readers would have taken from the 13 days – and counting – of Mail coverage about “beergate”. One front page, on 30 April, boomed: “Police told to investigate Labour’s lies.” A series of other similar front pages urged Durham police to look again at an incident that they had concluded in February had broken no Covid rules, and then explained at length how untenable Starmer’s position would be if the force changed its mind. Other stories have detailed what the paper insists are inconsistencies in Labour’s narrative about the evening in question, and reasons why it demonstrably broke guidelines in place at the time. It is, of course, now a matter for Durham police, who have some experience in politically charged Covid investigations, having decided to take no action against Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s then-chief adviser, for his ill-advised drives through their territory in the peak of lockdown. No one, beyond perhaps a handful of experienced detectives, knows what they will decide. But one thing seems clear: whatever happens, the Daily Mail will not be especially happy.",News/Politics,Damned when you do: why Starmer can’t win with the Mail,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/damned-when-you-do-why-starmer-cant-win-with-the-mail
5/10/2022,"Sri Lankan troops have conducted a dramatic pre-dawn operation to rescue the prime minister, firing warning shots in the air to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters who had stormed his official residence in Colombo. Five people were killed and nearly 200 were wounded on Monday in the worst violence in weeks of protests over an unprecedented economic crisis, and demonstrations continued on Tuesday. In an attempt to placate the protesters, the prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, resigned on Monday, but that did little to calm public anger. Protesters who forced their way into the capital’s “Temple Trees” residence attempted to storm the main two-storey building where Rajapaksa was holed up with his family. “After a pre-dawn operation, the former PM and his family were evacuated to safety by the army,” a top security official told AFP. “At least 10 petrol bombs were thrown into the compound.” Rajapaksa’s evacuation to an undisclosed location followed a day of violent protests in which five people, including a lawmaker, were killed and nearly 200 wounded. The security official said police kept up a barrage of teargas and fired warning shots in the air to hold back protesters at all three entrances to the colonial-era building, a key symbol of state power. Dozens of homes of top Rajapaksa loyalists were torched elsewhere in the curfew-bound country, which has been under a state of emergency since Friday. The emergency order from President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the outgoing premier’s younger brother, gave sweeping powers to the military as protests demanding the duo’s resignation escalated over the country’s worst-ever economic crisis. Protesters and Sri Lankan religious leaders blamed the former prime minister for instigating the family’s supporters to attack unarmed protesters on Monday, sparking retaliatory attacks. Rajapaksa’s resignation follows months of protests over the country’s deepening economic crisis, as once-peaceful demonstrations turned violent. Turmoil began to engulf the country on Monday after violence at a major protest site in Colombo, where pro-government supporters attacked demonstrators and police responded with teargas and water cannon. In one incident just outside Colombo, a politician from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters blocking his car, killing a 27-year-old, and then later took his own life. According to police, another ruling party politician opened fire on protesters in the southern town of Weeraketiya, killing two and wounding five. Mahinda Rajapaksa had been asked to resign by his brother at a special meeting on Friday, in an attempt to appease demonstrators who have been taking to the streets in their thousands since March. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka’s powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office for mishandling the economy and plunging the country into the worst financial crisis since independence. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was president for a decade between 2005 and 2015, had reportedly been resistant to stepping down, but on Monday submitted his letter of resignation to the president. “Multiple stakeholders have indicated the best solution to the present crisis is the formation of an interim all-party government. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation so the next steps can be taken in accordance with the constitution,” he wrote. The resignation is the latest concession made by the Rajapaksas in the face of protracted anger and protests. The president recently agreed to repeal an amendment to the constitution that had concentrated power in his hands and hand power back to the parliament. Other members of the Rajapaksa family who had previously held seats in the cabinet have also stepped down, with the president the only remaining member of the political family still in power. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, known widely as Gota, has repeatedly said he will not resign as president, despite the clarion call of the protests being “Gota go home”. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has rattled their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from those who had previously been supporters of their brand of chauvinist nationalist politics, which pandered to the country’s Sinhalese Buddhist majority. Sri Lanka’s foreign reserves have dropped so low that the country cannot afford to import basic essentials, leading to shortages of fuel, food and medicines. People have been forced to endure daily power cuts of up to 10 hours, fuelling mass protests across the country since March. Over the weekend, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, the second in recent weeks, in a bid to regain control over the streets. However, Monday marked a violent shift in the demonstrations when hundreds of pro-government supporters gathered outside the prime minister’s residence in Colombo and urged Mahinda Rajapaksa not to resign. The group, some armed with sticks and wooden bars, then launched an attack on an anti-government protest camp nearby, with police reportedly looking on as the clashes began.",News/World news,Troops rescue outgoing Sri Lanka PM as houses torched in deadly night of unrest ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/troops-rescue-outgoing-sri-lanka-pm-as-houses-torched-in-deadly-night-of-unrest
