3/27/2022,"In the late 1940s, amid the rubble of the Second World War, Dr Toichi Itoh was quietly working away to make the world a more beautiful place. With a lifelong fascination for one of the most iconic flowers of his native Japan, he had the fantasy to cross herbaceous peonies with tree peonies, to create incredible hybrids the likes of which had never been seen before. A trained botanist, he knew that if he could pull this off, a phenomenon called hybrid vigour would probably mean this elusive union would result in enormous flowers that were not only larger, but longer-lasting and available in totally novel colour combinations. There was just one small problem with his ambition: it was thought totally impossible. Not only do the flowers of the two peonies tend to bloom weeks apart, even if you could get them to coincide, genetic incompatibilities between the two meant the crosses would never take, hence why centuries of dedicated breeding had never even come close. But Dr Itoh was nothing if not tenacious, for after well over 20,000 attempts to make this cross by hand, in 1948 one miraculous seed pod ripened, creating a handful of healthy baby plants that defied what the botanical world thought possible. In a cruel twist of fate, however, he didn’t live long enough to see the first flowers of these slow-growing plants, but his tireless love of peonies has given later generations some of the most wonderful hybrids out there in the form of the ‘Itoh’ peonies that bear his name. These peonies combine the best of both worlds – often the fragrance of the herbaceous types, for example, alongside the long-lastingness of the tree forms. With their sturdy, compact architecture meaning they won’t need staking to avoid collapsing under the weight of their giant blooms, they are even far more resistant to peony blight and slug attack. As Dr Itoh predicted, hybrid vigour does indeed mean they produce the largest of all peony flowers. And, being sterile, their lack of pollination means they last around twice as long; some varieties will even throw up a second flush of flowers later in the year. I love ‘Canary Brilliants’ for its cocktail of peachy-pink and apricot-orange shades and powerful scent on metre-high plants. For fans of single-block colours, ‘Bartzella’ has massive, lemon yellow, double flowers, that look like cake decorations and have the most uplifting scent. ‘Pastel Splendor’ looks like an oriental poppy, with dusky pink, single flowers with the darkest of red patterns at their centre. It’s a variety that combines perfectly with ‘All that Jazz’, which is (to me) a double version of the former, with painted burgundy bases to their delicate pink petals. Now here comes the only catch: the enormous difficulty in producing these hybrids, a process that can even today take around 15 years, does mean they are much more expensive to buy, but what you are paying for is the dedication of geniuses like Dr Itoh, the fruit of whose passion you can enjoy for a lifetime.

3/27/2022,"A group of senior Labour women are to launch a new campaign to give mothers the resources to run for parliament, amid concerns that the prevailing Westminster culture puts women off standing while their children are young. In an attempt to revisit a successful campaign that helped boost the proportion of female Labour candidates in the 1990s, a group of MPs, former ministers and peers from the left and right of the party are backing a plan to end what they describe as a “motherhood penalty” in the party’s selection process. It follows claims by some potential candidates that they have been asked who is going to look after their children while they are fighting for a seat. Among those backing the campaign are Cherie Blair, Baroness Shami Chakrabarti and former home secretary Jacqui Smith, who will all help select potential candidates. The campaign, set up by Labour MP Stella Creasy, has been dubbed “MotheRED”. It comes months after Creasy was reprimanded for taking her three-month-old son along in a sling when she spoke in parliament late last year. She subsequently asked for urgent clarification of the rules. The organisers of the campaign said that, according to research by the Good Parliament Project, men with young children are as likely to stand or be elected as their peers, while women with young children remain underrepresented. It has been launched to coincide with Mothering Sunday. The successful candidates will be given a grant towards the costs of childcare and standing for election, and will also have to commit to backing a series of family-friendly policies on paternity leave, flexible working and childcare provision. The move comes after the party stated that childcare costs would be excluded from the cap on spending during selections. Selections for the next election are expected to intensify after local polls in May. “It’s good to see the party recognise that childcare during a selection process shouldn’t be part of a cap” said Creasy. “But finding the cash to cover these costs is still a barrier to participation for mums if you don’t have the extra money. “So many women tell us they get challenged about their status as a mum during selections and asked who is looking after their children. MotheRED is about tackling the culture in the party which means many brilliant women end up not standing or waiting until their children are much older – so we miss out on their talent in the parliamentary Labour party – and making sure more family-friendly policies like universal childcare are on the agenda.” The campaign, which is open for applications from Sunday and will raise a war chest through crowdfunding, echoes the Emily’s List effort of the 1990s, which helped MPs including Smith win seats at the 1997 election. “Getting selected to stand for election is lonely and tough,” said Smith. “When I received financial support from Emily’s List at the very start of my political career, I got an enormous practical boost to help with the costs, and a psychological boost knowing that other women recognised the hill I had to climb.” Chakrabarti added that the party which introduced all-women shortlists almost 30 years ago “must innovate once more”. The final list of candidates receiving support will be chosen by a 30-strong group of MotheRED ambassadors. The candidates will be expected to support policies including affordable childcare, a reformed benefits system and ringfenced paternity leave.",News/Society,Labour women lead push to make it easier for mothers to run for parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/labour-women-lead-push-to-make-it-easier-for-mothers-to-run-for-parliament
3/27/2022,"Covid-19 patients who have been hospitalised should also be routinely tested for flu, researchers have said. The call was made after the publication of a paper in the medical journal the Lancet that revealed having both conditions more than doubles the risk of a patient dying. Scientists also discovered that individuals who had contracted both Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and influenza viruses were more than four times more likely to require ventilation support and 2.4 times more likely to die than if they just had Covid-19. “We found that the combination of Covid-19 and flu viruses is particularly dangerous,” said Professor Kenneth Baillie of Edinburgh University. “We expect that Covid-19 will circulate with flu, increasing the chance of co-infections. That is why we should change our testing strategy for Covid-19 patients in hospital and test for flu much more widely.” The study looked at more than 305,000 hospitalised patients with Covid-19 and involved researchers from Edinburgh University, Liverpool University, Imperial College London and Leiden University in the Netherlands. A total of 6,965 patients were found to have had Covid-19, while 227 also had the influenza virus. These individuals experienced significantly more severe outcomes, researchers found. “We were surprised that the risk of death more than doubled when people were infected by both flu and Covid-19 viruses,” said Professor Calum Semple of Liverpool University. “It is now very important that people get fully vaccinated and boosted against both viruses, and not leave it until it is too late.” This point was stressed by Professor Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London. “The vaccines that protect against Covid-19 and flu are different, and people need both. The way that these two infections are treated is also different so it’s important to test for other viruses even when you have a diagnosis in someone who is hospitalised with a respiratory infection.” The scientists’ warning comes as it was revealed that more than 600,000 people will be invited for a Covid-19 booster jab this week as infection levels climb close to record highs in England. About one in 16 people in private households in England – or 3.5 million people – are likely to have had Covid in the week to 19 March, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is up from one in 20 – or 2.7 million people – in the previous seven days and is the third week in a row that infections are estimated to have risen. Since rolling out the spring boosters last week, more than 470,000 people have come forward for a jab, NHS England said. It is asking people to wait to be invited before trying to book, with the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommending that eligible people get their vaccine six months after their initial booster for maximum effectiveness. About 5.5 million people in England aged over 75 or immunosuppressed will be able to get the booster. Researchers say the steep rise in infections across much of the country is being driven by the Omicron BA.2 variant, a more transmissible form of Omicron. The figures are further evidence that Covid-19 is becoming rapidly more prevalent in the UK and come as the number of people in hospital with the virus continues to increase. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England has increased across all age groups and regions, the ONS found. Infection levels among the over-70s remain at their highest since estimates began in England in May 2020, with about one in 20 (5%) likely to have the virus, up week on week from one in 30 (3.5%). Covid-19 remains most prevalent among young children, however. About one in 12 (8.3%) of those aged between two and school year 6 are estimated to have had the coronavirus last week, up from one in 16 (6.3%)..",News/World news,"Patients with Covid and flu double the risk of dying, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/patients-with-covid-and-flu-double-the-risk-of-dying-say-scientists
3/27/2022,"Normality is another world for Shakhtar Donetsk. When Russia invaded Ukraine, football was stopped and the lives of the players, coaches, staff and fans were turned upside down in an instant. There was no time to waste with lives at stake as the autumn’s Champions League games against Real Madrid and Internazionale quickly became a distant memory. Sergei Palkin, the chief executive, has been at the forefront of the club’s humanitarian efforts and ensuring the safety of players from the academy to the first-team captain. Critical decisions were constantly needed as the invasion began, a world away from transfer and contract negotiations, as Shakhtar looked to use their influence to make a positive impact as football takes a backseat during the conflict. “We are dreaming when everything will be returned to normal, we dream of flying to play Champions League games,” Palkin says. “For us it will be the biggest win and the greatest happiness, but for now we can only dream about it. “When you are leading a normal life, you never think about being happy, or your freedom, as you do in all democratic countries. When you have this kind of situation where war has arrived in our homes, you start to think about the essential stuff.” The club left Donetsk for Lviv in 2014 after the outbreak of conflict with Russia that year. They have since endured a nomadic existence, moving to Kharkiv and then Kyiv as they looked to settle away from the fighting as their stadium, the Donbas Arena, was damaged by shelling. Knowing the impact of being forced out of their home, the club turned their focus on to humanitarian efforts in Lviv. “At the beginning it was quite hard. When the war started it was a mess at the border because thousands and thousands, maybe even millions, wanted to leave the country on one side and from the other we wanted to bring support, food and medicine from abroad, so it caused problems. Now the situation is clear and structured. We are working in a good and normal way but we still have a few logistical problems.” It is estimated that 3.7 million refugees have fled Ukraine since the start of the conflict, many passing through Lviv on their way to safety across the border in Poland. Shakhtar quickly formulated a plan to get their foreign players and coaching staff out of the country after moving them into a hotel in Kyiv. The director of football, Darijo Srna, took 36 hours to drive out of Ukraine as gridlocked roads delayed progress. With the help of the Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, the club’s players were taken to Romania with their families within a week of the invasion. Shakhtar know they need to look after the physical and mental wellbeing of their young players, who could be scarred for ever by the past month’s events. A huge project to take the club’s academy players abroad has meant many have travelled to the safety of Split thanks to the influence of Srna and assistance from the Croatian government, with 110 people already taken to the country. In the Lviv Arena, Shakhtar are providing supplies, including food, water and medicine to those passing through. The refugees, including many children, have left their hometowns across Ukraine, carrying only bare essentials. The club’s owner, Rinat Akhmetov, who has called Vladimir Putin a “war criminal”, is helping to finance the support at a stadium that had played host to Shakhtar when they first left Donetsk but is now sheltering thousands of people left without homes. “I stayed in Kyiv for two weeks and, after that, we talked with the club directors and decided we needed to start to help people and realised that a lot of refugees were coming to the western part of Ukraine and the directors decided to move to the west to open this humanitarian club,” says Palkin. “Thousands and thousands of people are coming from the eastern part of Ukraine; you see what is happening in Mariupol, with Kharkiv and other cities along the Russian border, therefore we are all trying to support them. Many of them are staying in the western parts of Ukraine, some of them go abroad to Poland, to Hungary and other countries, so they need big support here as the situation is catastrophic. In Mariupol, we have a humanitarian catastrophe and we need to help all those people.” Among those volunteering at the stadium are many of Shakhtar’s Ukrainian players who stayed behind, unless they have three or more children. While many of their age have joined the army, the players “have no war experience, so they are in last position to join the armed forces”, says Palkin. Instead, they are diligently working with those in Lviv, packing boxes of supplies and delivering them to those who need it. Their presence is reassuring and warmly felt as they take time to speak to those sheltering in the stadium. Shakhtar hold on to hope of playing once more, buoyed by the support shown throughout football. Seeing the Ukrainian flag adorn Premier League grounds is a morale boost. “We see everything that is going on around the world,” Palkin says. “We see the English championship, we see the German championship and before every game we see big support and for us it is very, very important because when we see this kind of support it brings us strength and we get stronger to help our situation. For us it is very important. Thank you very much to all the football people around the world who are supporting us.” There is, however, frustration within Shakhtar that the Premier League has not allowed players from Ukrainian clubs to move to England over fears it will damage sporting integrity, despite Fifa and Uefa extending the window owing to the extenuating circumstances. Football is not the focus for now, there are far more important things to be getting on with in a country ravaged by war, but optimism is still rife. “We all believe we will win, this is the most important thing,” a resolute Palkin says. “When you all believe in something and are united, this makes things more positive. We are not leading a normal life, when you switch on the TV to try and watch a film to relax. We have no time for this, you cannot think about relaxing. Now all of our efforts are on one purpose: to win this war.”",Sport/Football,Shakhtar provide supplies to refugees but ‘dreaming of return to normality’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/27/we-are-dreaming-when-everything-will-be-returned-to-normal
3/27/2022,"Women and girls staged a protest near the Taliban’s Ministry of Education in Kabul on Saturday, calling on the group to reopen girls’ secondary schools in Afghanistan. The protesters chanted, “Education is our right – open the doors of girls’ schools!” as armed Taliban members looked on. The Taliban have previously broken up demonstrations and detained those involved, but this protest was allowed to continue. The Taliban have been widely condemned for a last-minute U-turn last week ordering schools to close, just hours after teenage pupils began to arrive for the start of the new academic year. Since the Taliban took power, girls’ primary schools in most of the country, along with all boys’ schools, have remained open, but older girls have not been allowed back in the classroom. The Taliban’s Education Ministry said girls’ secondary schools would restart on Wednesday last week, but the decision was overruled by the group’s central leadership, who said they would remain closed until a “comprehensive” and “Islamic” plan had been drawn up. After the Taliban’s ban on girls’ education beyond the age of 11, women’s rights activist Mahbouba Seraj went on Afghanistan’s Tolo TV to ask: “How do we as a nation trust you with your words any more? What should we do to please you? Should we all die?” An Afghan charity called PenPath, which runs dozens of “secret” schools with thousands of volunteers, plans to stage countrywide protests demanding the Taliban reverse its order, said Matiullah Wesa, PenPath’s founder. The Taliban’s U-turn is believed to reflect divisions between hardline and more moderate elements. In some provinces, particularly in northern Afghanistan, local Taliban officials have allowed teenage girls to continue to study, but others appear to oppose the idea. The US Special Representative for Afghanistan said on Saturday he was hopeful the U-turn would be rethought. Thomas West told the Doha Forum: “I am hopeful we will see a reversal of this decision in the coming days.” The US had cancelled economic meetings with the Taliban in Doha, officials said. In a further deterioration of life under Taliban rule, women were prevented from boarding aircraft, including some flying overseas, because they were travelling without a male guardian, two Afghan airline officials said on Saturday. Officials said dozens of women who arrived at Kabul’s international airport on Friday to board domestic and international flights were told that they could not do so without a male guardian. Some of the women were dual nationals returning to their homes overseas, including some from Canada, it was reported. Women were denied boarding on flights to Islamabad, Dubai and Turkey on Kam Air and the state-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines after a Taliban leadership order, the officials said.",News/World news,Protesters call for the Taliban to reopen Afghan girls’ schools ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/protesters-call-for-the-taliban-to-reopen-afghan-girls-schools
3/27/2022,"One Monday in March 2020, Joe Lycett got a call inviting him to go on live TV to explain why he’d recently changed his name by deed poll to Hugo Boss. Long story short, he’d done it to challenge the brand’s heavy-handed use of cease and desist letters, and it was a typically Lycettian stunt, Robin Hooding the rich with humour and a small amount of rage. It was one of his rare days off, when he wasn’t filming a Channel 4 show or on a standup tour. Which meant that, when he got the call, Lycett was doing his unofficial weekend job, caring for a friend who was dying of bowel cancer. “I said, ‘They want me on the Victoria Derbyshire programme in an hour.’ And he was sat next to me in the bed like, ‘Well, off you go then!’ He loved it. All the carnage I create.” So his friend would’ve loved what happened two years later. “I go for a swim with my mum once a week,” he says, taking a delicate swig of coffee. “And she normally takes a bit longer to come out, so while I was waiting I posted a made-up Sue Gray report on Twitter. I found the Cabinet Office logo and put it together as a little image on my phone.” It was the end of January 2022 and partygate was raging. Which was why it wasn’t a huge surprise when he got a message from someone who works in Parliament to say it had been read as a serious leak, that MPs were visibly panicking. Among the “findings” on Lycett’s document were the revelation that one of Johnson’s staff was referred to as “Twateral Flow”, and that they played a game called “Pass the Arsehole”. He tells me the story with glee, in full and considered paragraphs, holding eye contact. “One of the things I both loved and hated about my friend was that he’d always stay at a party after everyone else had gone, whereas I love going home. So when he was told he had days to live, he defied all of it, and just kept going.” Until of course, he didn’t. The day after Lycett’s Sue Gray report made headlines, he tweeted again. “I write comedy sometimes as a way of anger,” he began. He was angry, he said, because his friend had died in lockdown, “and I wasn’t there because I was following the rules, and we had a tiny insufficient funeral, because we were following the rules, and I drove his kids away from that funeral back to Birmingham without any sort of wake, because we were following the rules, and it felt unnatural and cruel and almost silly, but we did it because we followed the rules.” He ended quietly: “You might wonder how it feels to have been described in the papers as having caused these people ‘chaos’ and ‘mayhem’ and ‘mass panic’ because of a few jokes. Let me be clear: it feels absolutely fucking fantastic.” It was one of those moments when a flag was stuck in the wet sand of the pandemic, an anger perfectly articulated that resonated first across the internet and then across the country. He only wishes his friend could have seen it – he would have been thrilled at the chaos. “I’m very proud of what I wrote,” he says. “And it feels like a good use for my comedy.” Because yes, while Joe Lycett is very keen to make people laugh, he also wants his work to have an impact, and he does this largely by being lovely. There’s another comic he adores: “Quite an auntie-like figure, really smiley, and then she calls you a cunt and you love it. I think that sort of thing is quite powerful. You can get away with so much when you’re nice.” He chuckles, delightful. Recently he made a documentary about greenwashing, pointing out that the $900m Shell claims to spend on renewables is dwarfed by the $17.8 bn of their total investments. When he visited the Shell headquarters to confront them, “Our director found it so fascinating. Having worked on lots of other films where people are in your face, with a banner maybe, he saw that security don’t really know how to deal with someone who’s not being aggressive, who’s just being very lovely, telling them you like their jacket. It’s disarming. And so I run with that as much as possible.” Along with the Hugo Boss stunt, three series of his consumer watchdog show Joe Lycett’s Got Your Back have seen him challenge Uber Eats’ hygiene policies by creating a takeaway located in an old skip, and flashmob a bank into refunding a defrauded customer. Rather than trying to fix the world, Lycett attempts to massage its smaller bureaucratic aches – Got Your Back, he offers, is a show that “celebrates the paper cuts of life”. The Lycett I meet today is gently but noticeably different from the Lycett on TV – similarly charming, joyfully charismatic, but… “More masculine?” he suggests. “After lockdown I watched some of my old videos and I just didn’t recognise myself at all. Who is this person that’s flailing about being camp and ridiculous? It felt like another life that only exists on stage and drunk in gay clubs. Before I started performing I was always very irritating and obnoxious at dinner parties. Comedy is a good outlet for that – I can get the praise that I clearly need from that section of my life. And then the rest of the time I sort of enjoy being a bloke with a cat, doing my gardening.” On Instagram he has a fabulous sideline in gardening content, much of which involves labelling his camellias variations on “slag”. He is insistent that he’s not a political comedian. “I’m not!” You are, I say. “I’m not.” You are. “Am I?” He uses his shows as a sharpened tickling stick, embarrassing corporations into behaving better. He speaks vividly and regularly online about LGBTQ rights. Though less obviously political, the matter-of-fact way he discusses his own mental health is striking. For the last year of his friend’s life he couldn’t eat or drink, and later Lycett realised it was this association that led to him getting panic attacks where he was convinced he was going to be sick. “And so I started to sort of close myself off from the world, which was obviously the wrong thing to do. Because what I’ve since discovered through therapy is to overcome those things, you have to do tons of it, and see that you’re OK.” He grimaces. “I had ‘an outbreak’ just before going on live TV. I thought I was going to be sick on Lorraine. Which actually would have been amazing. Ten minutes of standup writing itself.” He tweets Boris Johnson after PMQs as if he’s his best girlfriend, and he channels his anger into jolly but subversive stunts, which have led to him becoming a national treasure in waiting. “I do worry. There’s genocide happening all over the shop and I’m worried about somebody who’s been attacked in a gay village in Birmingham. Is my anger proportional here? But I suppose I’m cross because it’s my community. And at the moment I can see how the same mistakes and judgments are being made that I’ve seen before. I feel like we’re going backwards, and so that does make me cross.” In what way? “Trans rights for instance. The way trans people are talked about in the British media is completely different to America. It’s really important to talk about. I thrive and I exist and have rights because people before me fought for them. It’s my duty to do the same for the trans and non-binary community. I’m not a woman, so I can’t comment on what it is to be a woman. But I know it’s not right to treat people inhumanely.” When he talks about anger, sometimes it seems more like fear, or grief. “Stonewall, like any organisation of that size, will have made mistakes. But if you lose it, there’s nothing like it. You won’t see it again. And some people’s lives depend on it. It feels like the attack on Stonewall is emblematic of the attack on LGBT rights at large.” He’s bisexual, which means (he joked to an audience), “You’re all at risk.” How much does his queerness inform his work? “I think if I wasn’t queer, I’d probably be working at” – he hmmm’s – “Ernst & Young. Doing some sort of mid- to top-tier accountant role. Probably pulling in around £100k? I’d have a very nice wife, two children, one with learning difficulties, but nothing that will hinder them too much.” He looks a little wistful. “Subconsciously, very early on, I knew I was not going to thrive in a corporate environment. The way I speak, let alone dress, was not encouraged. And so it’s not even really about sexuality, it’s about identity – it’s not about who you’re fucking, it’s about what you want to say. And my very existence was always sort of… questionable. I think the anger that I sometimes feel towards institutions is probably pent-up anger from that time. The institutions that turn you into the men that work for these institutions only serve the ones that conform, and anyone who can’t do that is left behind.” A few years ago a particularly nasty school bully served him in a Tesco Express, and told him how funny he was on TV. Lycett didn’t quite know what to do, so he said thank you, brightly. On a signet ring Lycett wears on his left hand is the dialling code for Birmingham, his home and, arguably, his muse. He was born there in 1988, and after a decade of touring the country’s comedy clubs, and going viral after an 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown appearance in which he recounted a battle with York Council over a parking ticket (apart from popping down to London to film The Great British Sewing Bee or, for instance, Iceland to film Travel Man), Birmingham is where he’s stayed. In 2019, after buying a house in Kings Heath he invited the Birmingham lord mayor Yvonne Mosquito to officially open his kitchen extension. “It’s just a quietly creative and brilliant place. And it’s not showing off about being brilliant, it’s just getting on with it.” His new show is built around a stunt he’s been working on for three years, which began when he realised he’d paid too much for his house, but ended up as, “a love letter to my local community – it’s the thing I’ve made that I’m most proud of.” Why? “Because at its core, the show’s not about me. It’s about my neighbours’ goodwill.” The stunt includes aliases, drag queens, estate agents and phone calls from the police. “And it’s kind of amazing doing the previews and watching audiences as they realise what’s happening. It’s beautiful to see them go, ‘Wow, people; people are good.’ We all needed that; a reminder that out of something as silly as me trying to get my house price up, this incredibly empowering event can happen.” The new show is called More, More, More! How Do You Lycett? How Do You Lycett?, with previous standup shows titled I’m About to Lose Control and I Think Joe Lycett and That’s The Way A-Ha A-Ha, Joe Lycett, which correctly suggest audiences dancing into the theatres, and him cheered before he’s even tried to bring down the government or told an impish story about his visit to the post office. He brings up a specific comic strip. The first square is a comic on a podcast, quietly and seriously explaining the importance of comedy as an artform, as a political tool. And the second is the same comic on stage shouting about all the pussy he gets. “I know comedy isn’t high art, it’s basically just men shouting shit into rooms of drunk people,” he says, twinkling. “But I do love it.” Tickets for Joe Lycett’s tour, More, More, More!

3/27/2022,"Danish-born Norwegian writer-director Joachim Trier’s existential tragicomedy opened to rave reviews in Cannes last year and has since garnered international awards recognition, including Oscar nominations for original screenplay (with regular co-writer Eskil Vogt) and international feature film. Described by Trier as “a coming-of-age film for grownups who feel like they still haven’t grown up”, it continues the director’s cinematic love affair with the Norwegian capital, previously explored in Reprise and Oslo, August 31st, with which this forms a loose trilogy. Blending melancholy wistfulness with unruly energy and piercing humour, it’s a down-to-earth tale of love and death, boosted by a brilliantly believable central performance and elevated by fantastical moments of hallucinogenic horror and ecstatic joy. Cannes best actress winner Renate Reinsve is a revelation as Julie, a potential high-achiever with an aversion to “seeing things through”, whose life goals are a moving target – personal, professional and romantic. On the surface, she enjoys freedoms that her predecessors could never have imagined, forever reinventing herself as she searches for a persona that fits her psyche. Yet while 21st-century social mobility may have rewritten the rules of social engagement, the expectation of finding “success” in love remains oppressively omnipresent, heightened by the impending spectre of Julie’s 30th birthday. Is her ideal partner out there waiting for her? Has she already blown her chances of happiness? And what happens when two perfectly matched people’s paths cross just as their respective timelines diverge? In an interview with this paper, Reinsve noted astutely: “We asked questions when we made this movie and I feel we didn’t give any answers”, adding that the film was more like “a big conversation” than a statement. That’s certainly true of her portrayal of Julie, who has the quality of being that rarest of screen beings - a work in progress. Over a couple of hours, divided in mock-literary style into 12 chapters plus prologue and epilogue, we see Julie evolve, making (often reckless) decisions, the tangible consequences of which seem to be physically absorbed into Reinsve’s mesmerising performance. Thus, we watch as Julie falls for Aksel (Anders Danielsen Lie), a comic-book author several years her senior, whose down-and-dirty non-PC creations are becoming popular enough to risk being neutered for the mainstream market. They seem a happy couple despite the differing demands of their respective ages, such as whether or not to start a family. But in her daydreams Julie flies off to an assignation with Eivind (Herbert Nordrum), whom she met while gatecrashing a wedding and with whom she spends a blissful evening playfully testing the boundaries of what constitutes “cheating”. In his previous film, Thelma, Trier flirted with the supernatural spectre of Stephen King’s Carrie, conjuring an eerie vision in which burgeoning sexuality seems to slip into telekinesis. While The Worst Person in the World may be an altogether more “realist” work, Trier (who inserted a clip of Dario Argento’s stylish slasher Opera into his English-language film Louder Than Bombs) retains an affection for the fantastical, most notably in a breathtaking sequence in which Julie makes a cross-town dash through Oslo to spend a perfect day with Eivind, while time stands still for the city’s other inhabitants. Remember the grotesquely glib time-stopped set pieces from Sean Ellis’s supposedly “arty” 2006 British rom-(non)-com Cashback? Now imagine the flipside of those misogynist interludes, as Trier perfectly captures the heady euphoria of infatuation that our heroine experiences in all its infinite beauty and sadness. No wonder a shot of Reinsve’s beaming face from this sequence has become the film’s defining poster image, her propulsive happiness contrasting starkly with a title that will strike a chord with anyone who has ever loved and lost and blamed themselves. Shot in sensuous 35mm by Kasper Tuxen and blessed with an anarchic spirit that at times reminded me of Maren Ade’s sublimely awkward German comedy drama Toni Erdmann, this is far and away Trier’s best work to date. As for Reinsve, who was on the brink of abandoning acting altogether when this role came calling, it is surely the launchpad for a remarkable screen career.",Arts/Film,The Worst Person in the World –  a mesmerising heroine for our times,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/27/the-worst-person-in-the-world-a-mesmerising-heroine-for-our-times
3/27/2022,"The troops gathered on the border. The supreme leader decided that it was time to invade, to teach the other side a lesson. Shortly afterwards, troops breached the internationally recognised border and clashed with local forces. Not Ukraine 2022, but Vietnam 1979. In January of that year, the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping told the US president Jimmy Carter that he wanted to “spank the butt” of his neighbours. For a month, Chinese and Vietnamese forces clashed, leading to a death toll of tens of thousands. Chinese troops withdrew in March 1979, when, unlike Vladimir Putin, Deng sensibly decided to declare a famous victory and head home. Since then, there has been no unambiguous breach of an international border by Chinese troops. China’s brief invasion of Vietnam isn’t much talked about today during the Ukraine crisis. None of the western actors wants to bring it up when they are trying to pressure China over its general fixation on the sanctity of national sovereignty. And Moscow won’t mention it, because it brings back an awkward memory for their friends in Beijing: China’s 1979 venture wasn’t really about Vietnam, but about Russia. Sino-Soviet relations had become poisonous ever since the split between the two communist superpowers in 1960. Vietnam, with Soviet backing, invaded and occupied Cambodia in 1978, ousting the Khmer Rouge. In the bizarre cold war politics of the time, both the US and China supported Pol Pot’s genocidal regime because its Vietnamese enemy was supported by Moscow. On 4 February, at the Beijing Winter Olympics, Xi Jinping and Putin declared a “friendship without limits”. Shortly afterwards, Russia invaded Ukraine; most analysts judge that Beijing had some idea that Russia would attempt to seize further Ukrainian territory but almost certainly did not realise that there would be a full invasion. China is genuinely concerned about the Russian destruction of Ukraine’s sovereignty, although it will not say so in public, calling instead at the UN for vaguely defined humanitarian gestures and censoring pro-Ukraine sentiments on Chinese social media. But Beijing seems to see little benefit in becoming a mediator in the conflict, judging that many of its partners in the global south, such as Pakistan and South Africa, do not consider a European crisis to be an existential test for them or for China. China’s primary motivations in seeking peace between Russia and Ukraine are pragmatic. Ukraine is an important, though not crucial, source of grain for China and having to find new suppliers of cheap cereals in a hurry for its middle-class population could fuel inflation. There are pluses for China in a settlement that leaves Putin in charge but weaker and still sanctioned. China could become the sole major market for Russia’s wheat and fossil fuels, obtainable at bargain prices, although traditional allies of Russia such as India have not taken nearly such a hard line against Moscow as the west and might also provide markets. Russia is also still China’s preferred partner to create semi-formal military groupings (rather than Nato-style binding alliances) against the west. Beijing has repeatedly suggested the Shanghai Cooperation Organization should be used to mediate in Ukraine; the SCO is a would-be Nato dominated by China and Russia, with India and central Asian states as members. However, the Russia-China relationship is not just about power politics pure and simple. Somewhere in the pragmatic relationship of the present day lies muscle memory of a more emotional link between China and Russia, not just the Soviet Union but a longer tradition of Russian literature and culture that shaped the modern Chinese revolution. One of China’s greatest modern authors, Ba Jin, took his pen name from syllables in the Chinese transliterated names of the revolutionaries Bakunin and Kropotkin. Young Chinese women, leaving their families to take part in the communist uprising of the 1940s, would cite Turgenev’s poem Threshold (1878). The work is written in the voice of a man speaking to a young woman about to join the anti-tsarist movement; he says she will suffer “alienation” and “loneliness”, to which she replies: “I know, and I still want to enter.” The heyday of that Russian influence was in the 1940s, when Soviet ideology and the lure of Soviet technology also influenced Chinese visions of Moscow as the future, and in the 1950s, when the country was isolated from the US. It was emotionally distinct from the anti-foreign Cultural Revolution that Xi grew up with, but it was very much the world of his father, the veteran revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun. From the 1960s to the end of the cold war, the love turned to hatred, as ideological disputes brought the two countries close to war over border islands on the Ussuri River in 1969, prompting Chinese enthusiasm for the opening to the US that took place just over 50 years ago. In recent decades, the relationship has become warmer, as Moscow and Beijing realise that it gives them both cover against the encroachment of the west. Yet the post-cold war trajectory of Putin’s Russia and Xi’s China is not the same. China has seen its economy and global influence soar, while Russia’s spending power and life expectancy have shrunk. In some areas, such as central Asia, cooperation masks mutual distrust. Russian residents of Siberia have become increasingly resentful of Chinese investment in their region. China has created one of the most powerful civilian and military economies in the world, yet Russia’s elites still look to the west, many considering China rich but “uncultured” (nekulturny, a much stronger insult in Russian than English). China feels a little superior because Russia has never come up with a Huawei; Russia is a touch contemptuous because China has never produced a Dostoyevsky. In that ambivalence, along with unmentioned episodes such as the 1979 proxy war between them, lies a shared history of respect and resentment. This still seems to flavour the relationship today between Xi and Putin.  Rana Mitter is author of China’s Good War: How World War II Is Shaping a New Nationalism (2020).

3/27/2022,"In December 2018, actor Amber Heard published a column in the Washington Post that was a clarion call for providing more support to women who speak about domestic violence. Heard, now 35, described personal experience in arguing for change. “Like many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet – I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didn’t see myself as a victim,” Heard wrote. “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.” “Friends and advisers told me I would never again work as an actress – that I would be blacklisted. A movie I was attached to recast my role. I had just shot a two-year campaign as the face of a global fashion brand, and the company dropped me,” Heard continued. “Questions arose as to whether I would be able to keep my role of Mera in the movies ‘Justice League’ and ‘Aquaman.’” Heard did not mention her alleged abuser by name, but the timing of this piece indicated that she was talking about her ex-husband, Hollywood star Johnny Depp. Heard had publicly accused Depp of domestic abuse in 2016. Depp filed a $50m defamation lawsuit against Heard in March 2019, arguing: “The op-ed’s clear implication that Mr Depp is a domestic abuser is categorically and demonstrably false.” Depp’s suit alleged that Heard’s piece left his reputation and career in tatters, so much so that he was dropped from the role of Captain Jack Sparrow in Disney’s wildly popular Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Depp not only denied Heard’s allegations, but claimed that she abused him. Heard has since filed counterclaims against Depp, alleging that he defamed her. It has been an immense legal battle between the pair that has generated a slew of headlines and kept both of them in the media spotlight regardless of their work onscreen. But now their made-for-tabloid legal battle will reach a crescendo on 11 April, when the case goes to trial in Fairfax county, Virginia. At issue in the case is far more than two bold-face names: it’s about domestic violence, free speech and victims’ rights. That’s all far from the usual tittle-tattle that happens when celebrities hit the court circuit. Depp and Heard met while filming the 2011 comedy The Rum Diary. They wed in 2015 in Los Angeles, USA Today reported. Heard sought divorce from Depp in 2016. She also obtained a restraining order against him, claiming their divorce was finalized in 2017. Heard won $7m, promising that she would donate this money to the American Civil Liberties Union, according to People and the newspaper. Depp’s rise to immense global fame began in the mid-1980s. His first non-extra movie role was in the 1984 film Nightmare on Elm Street. Depp’s breakthrough came in 1987 when he landed a position on 21 Jump Street. His rise to mainstream stardom was in 1990, when he appeared in John Waters’ Cry-Baby and Tim Burton’s Edward Scissorhands. Exactly what impact the Virginia proceedings will have on first amendment free speech protections, or victims’ rights, remains unclear until the trial begins. However, it is all but certain the proceedings will provide as clear an answer as possible about whether Depp abused Heard. “There are a lot of issues that have to be unpacked in any defamation case,” said Mariann Wang, who represented former Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos in her defamation case against Donald Trump. “Fundamentally, if the speaker can prove that what she said or wrote was true, that will bar his claim.” Roy Gutterman, director of the Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications, provided a similar explanation. “A plaintiff in a defamation case has to prove that a false statement is published about that person and that it causes harm to their reputation,” Gutterman said. “Looking at this from the outside, I think the biggest issue is really the truth or falsity of the allegations – whether Johnny Depp committed domestic violence against his wife or then-girlfriend and, on the converse, whether Amber Heard made stuff up about this.” Those interviewed by the Guardian had mixed views as to whether lawsuits filed against accusers might deter others from coming forward. “You’d expect the increase in high profile defamation lawsuits against women discussing prior sexual assaults and intimate partner violence to have a silencing effect on victims wanting to talk about their traumas,” Carrie Goldberg, owner of victims’ rights law firm C A Goldberg, PLLC, said in an email. “But instead, we’re seeing that victims with something to say are getting savvier about how to discuss their abuse while protecting themselves from litigation. We’re getting more cases where survivors of assault and abuse come to us for legal advice before sharing their stories.” “Rarely will a plaintiff-abuser actually be able to disprove an assault or abuse, but abusers sue because they think that will somehow help their public profile – as if by calling their accuser a liar, the public will believe the allegations are untrue,” Goldberg also said. “Mostly, the abuser’s goal is to bring the lawsuit to intimidate the other person into retracting and apologizing. “Unfortunately, the abusers who bring defamation cases tend to be wealthy and able to afford legal fees, while the victims are not necessarily of equal financial power. So the victim may be incentivized to retract, rather than spend six figures they don’t have defending a lawsuit.” Gutterman said: “Whenever we see one of these defamation cases, especially with a verdict against a speaker or a writer, there’s always a fear of a chilling effect, and the underlying Washington Post column was a serious exploration of an individual’s experience with domestic violence.” “It’s also important to note that Johnny Depp wasn’t specifically named in that piece, though she’s always going to be linked to him so it wouldn’t really take much to connect the two,” Gutterman pointed out. “As a society, under the first amendment, we want to allow people to express themselves on important issues such as domestic violence and abuse – and I wouldn’t want to see liability attached to [that.]” Several of those interviewed noted that defamation cases bring attention to the events behind allegedly damaging statements. High-profile cases will be chronicled by the media. Discourse surrounding alleged wrongdoing will continue – regardless of the outcome – putting to question whether a victorious plaintiff actually wins. The fact that allegations will be litigated in public are “often a reason why many people do not bring defamation claims,” Wang said. “It becomes the centerpiece of the trial, so you end up, in fact, prolonging the conversation around the underlying facts,” continued Wang, of Cuti Hecker Wang LLP. “Defamation actions can be very exhausting and brutal on both sides … under any circumstance, the underlying accusations are going to be talked about and entertained.” “This case is a mess, to tell you the truth,” Gutterman said at one point during his interview. “And in a way, they’re re-litigating a contentious marriage through civil tort law with these dueling defamation claims.” Gutterman pointed to Depp’s unsuccessful defamation case against the British tabloid newspaper the Sun over an April 2018 column that called him a “wife beater”. The judge dismissed Depp’s libel claim, determining that the column was “substantially true” – and found that he assaulted Heard on a dozen occasions and made her “fear for her life” three times. “The court in the Sun case found that there was substantial truth in the allegation even though Amber Heard wasn’t a party to that lawsuit – certain elements of the underlying facts might play out even in the Virginia court,” Gutterman also said. “It’s already been so messy – and frankly, so disturbing – to see this play out in public, I would imagine the only end game he has is to try to restore his reputation,” said Winter Wheeler, a mediator and arbitrator who previously worked as a litigator. “In my opinion, I don’t think that happens from winning this case, if he does, in fact win.” “I think people have already made a decision about how they feel about him, and I don’t think that that’s going to change,” Wheeler said. “Dragging your alleged victim back into court doesn’t sit well with your average person.” “If I had to mediate this case, I would ask him, ‘What are you really trying to accomplish here? Because ultimately, you’re not going to walk away with a net positive,” Wheeler added. “It’s just more people with their eyes on you.”",News/Law,Heard v Depp: dueling defamation claims embroil actor and her ex in court battle,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/27/amber-heard-johnny-depp-dueling-defamation-claims-court
3/27/2022,"Despite reaching one of the darkest moments in more than 40 years as a dissident and human rights activist, Oleg Orlov says that he has no plans to flee Russia. “I made a decision a long time ago that I want to live and die in Russia, it’s my country,” Orlov told the Observer. “Even though it’s never been so bad.” That’s saying something for Orlov, who can recall printing homemade anti-war posters in the late 1970s to protest against the Russian invasion of Afghanistan or in support of Poland’s Solidarnost movement, and was an observer and negotiator during the bloody war in Chechnya in the 1990s. He has been arrested three times for holding pickets since late February, when Russian troops launched an assault on Ukraine. And he doesn’t rule out a prison term in his future. “I understand the high likelihood of a criminal case against me and my colleagues,” he said. “But we have to do something … even if it is just to go out with a picket and speak honestly about what is happening.” Tens of thousands of Russians have fled the country since it invaded Ukraine, fearing a wave of government repression and a possible closure of Russia’s borders similar to what happened in the Soviet Union. However, a devoted, diverse cadre of anti-war activists have stayed behind, continuing to protest, post online , fundraise and organise opposition to Vladimir Putin’s war against their neighbour. “I made a decision that I’m not going. That was my decision,” said Ilya Yashin, 38, a veteran street and political activist who also serves as a municipal deputy in Moscow. “I understand all the risks. I understand what it could mean for me. “But it seems to me that anti-war voices sound louder and more convincing if the person remains in Russia,” he said. Yashin has continued to speak out against the war publicly, filming streams on his YouTube channel that reach 1.5 million viewers or more. He estimated that 80% of his friends and colleagues, many in opposition politics or journalism, had left the country. “I think I have more friends in Georgia and in Vilnius now than in Moscow,” he said. There was no judgment of those who had left, he said, while he looked on those who stayed with “great sympathy, great respect”. Through his activism, he also hoped to show that many Russians do not support this war. “What’s the point of doing politics in Russia if you’re not willing to protest against war at such a historic moment?” he said. The danger to activists like Orlov and Yashin is real. The government has already opened nearly a dozen cases into alleged “fakes” about the military, which can carry a sentence of up to 15 years, and has made more than 15,000 arrests of protesters. “There are a lot of people asking for advice about whether to leave,” said Pavel Chikov, the head of Agora, a Russian human rights group based in Kazan, Tartarstan. “I tell all of them that if you’re thinking about leaving, you have to leave and watch the Titanic from the [rescue] boat, not on board.” “If people are hesitating, they will blame themselves if they stay and can’t leave later,” he said. Chikov compared the situation to that of the condition for activists inside Chile under Augusto Pinochet, or in Turkey after the recent failed coup attempt. “There’s no understanding of how far or how deep this can go,” he said. In Yekaterinburg, Yevgeny Roizman has been a fixture in local politics for two decades. The former mayor and anti-narcotics activist is a rare official in the regions to express openly his support of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. A month after calling the war an act of “betrayal” by Russia against Ukraine, he continues to hold open-door consultations with local residents, a hallmark of his social activism in Russia’s fourth-largest city. “I am almost 60, I lived my whole life in Russia, where the hell am I going to go?” Roizman said at the weekend. “Many people see me as an example – they are staying because they see that I haven’t left,” he said. “My presence gives them the assurance that everything will be normal one day. And I know I am not alone in the country – there are still many normal people left.” Roizman said he doesn’t judge the many who have fled but that he needs to be able to “look myself in the mirror”. “I now understand how the anti-fascists felt during the Third Reich,” he said. “But I can’t flee, it is unacceptable for me to do that.” Others reasons for staying are diverse. Some worried about family members, and others were concerned that once they left they would probably never be able to come back. Lucy Shtein, a municipal deputy and member of Pussy Riot, said she felt she could be more effective as an activist outside Russia, but that she could not leave because she is awaiting sentencing for promoting a pro-Navalny protest. “I always wanted to stay in Russia until the very end because I knew that once I leave I will not be able to return for a long time,” she said. Dmitry Ivanov, a pro-democracy activist and computer science student who runs the “Protest at MGU” [Moscow State University] Telegram channel, also said he feared that if he leaves, “then there will be no way back”. The IT student would probably be “welcomed abroad”, and said the police had “shown a lot of interest in me”. But he insisted that he had not done anything illegal, just “encourage others to go out and protest peacefully”. “That is allowed by law,” he said. “I don’t think I should be afraid or run away. This is my country.”",News/World news,‘Our voices are louder if we stay’: Russian anti-war activists refuse to flee,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/our-voices-are-louder-if-we-stay-russian-anti-war-activists-refuse-to-flee
3/27/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the government will deliver a cost of living package that will offer relief “right across the Australian community”, amid growing expectations that the fuel excise will be cut. As he announced a $365m extension of an apprenticeship wage subsidy scheme in Perth on Sunday, Morrison said the budget would seek to provide financial assistance to households without driving up inflation. “This budget once again is about Australians – the pressures they face, the cost of living pressures that they’re having to deal with. To guarantee the essential services that they rely on, to ensure that we can keep them safe (and) that we can support the defence forces that secure our position in a very volatile Indo-Pacific region,” Morrison said. “It’s about the economic plan which is going to guarantee their economic success, not just over the next couple of years, but for the decade ahead.” He said the government’s record in managing the pandemic demonstrated that it had the financial credentials to “keep the pressure on inflation down”, saying Labor would have paid people to get vaccinated and unnecessarily extended jobkeeper. “The problem with Labor is when they start spending they can never stop – they don’t have the discipline. We have the discipline to know when you need to spend and when you need to stop.” The government has already announced a number of measures ahead of Tuesday’s budget, including business cashflow assistance, new health funding, infrastructure commitments and more money for veterans and defence. But the shape of the government’s cost of living package – expected to be the centrepiece of treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s fourth budget – remains unclear. The government is pegging its pre-election political recovery on the budget, with current polling figures suggesting an uphill battle for the Coalition to win the May election. There has been robust internal debate over whether to extend or increase the tax offset for low and middle income earners, but Frydenberg has insisted this was always intended as a temporary measure that had worked as an economic stimulus. Low and middle income earners on up to $126,000 a year are already in line to receive the payment of up to $1,080 when they lodge their tax return for the current financial year. With the economy recovering strongly and expectations that inflation could hit 5% this year with wages lagging behind, Frydenberg has indicated an additional but more modest cash payment for wage earners and some welfare recipients will be forthcoming. Pensioners are expected to receive a $250 payment as part of the pre-election cash splash. Frydenberg also suggested the government would cut the 44c per litre fuel excise to help motorists with the price of petrol, which is now more than $2.20 a litre. “Fuel prices have skyrocketed and for many families this is not a choice” Frydenberg told the ABC on Sunday. “These are costs that families are incurring and, of course, are putting real pressure on household’s budget.” Frydenberg is also flagging a “significant” improvement to the budget bottom line, which is benefiting from soaring commodity prices, higher than expected tax receipts and lower payments. “That’s the fiscal dividend we are getting to the bottom line from having a strong economy,” Frydenberg said in a separate interview on Channel Nine. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said Labor was “broadly supportive” of a cut to fuel excise that would help address cost of living pressures, but said there also needed to be consideration of reforms that had “enduring economic benefit”. “Certainly Australians need some kind of relief from these costs of living pressures. Petrol is a big part of the story, as everybody knows, but it’s not the only part of the story,” Chalmers told the ABC’s Insiders program. “We think that there is a place for cost of living relief in the childcare system, we think there’s a place for cost of living relief when it comes to power bills, and our policies go to those solutions.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison spruiks cost of living package as expectations of fuel excise cut grow,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/27/scott-morrison-spruiks-cost-of-living-package-as-expectations-of-fuel-excise-cut-grow
3/27/2022,"In August 1968, as Soviet tanks rolled into Prague, a small group of students and writers in Moscow organised a protest in solidarity with the people of Czechoslovakia. The poet Natalya Gorbanevskaya and seven other dissidents sat down in Moscow’s Red Square and unfurled banners with slogans that have a chilling resonance today: “We are Losing Our Friends”; “Shame on Occupiers”; “For Your Freedom and Ours”; and “Long Live a Free and Independent Czechoslovakia”. This extraordinary act of courage was met with customary brutality. The activists were arrested and most served long sentences in penal colonies. Gorbanevskaya was sent to a psychiatric hospital. Václav Havel, the dissident playwright who became president of Czechoslovakia in 1989, later wrote: “For the citizens of Czechoslovakia, these people became the conscience of the Soviet Union, whose leadership without hesitation undertook a despicable military attack on a sovereign state and ally.” These dissidents were also the inspiration for the free expression organisation Index on Censorship, which turns 50 this month. Among their number was young teacher Pavel Litvinov, who was sentenced to five years in a Siberia labour camp. Earlier, Litvinov had co-authored a pamphlet entitled Appeal to World Public Opinion, calling on the west to wake up to the suppression of dissent in the Soviet Union, which he likened to Stalin’s show trials of the 1930s. “We appeal to everyone in whom conscience is alive and who has sufficient courage,” he wrote and described the crackdown as “a stain on the honour of our state and on the conscience of all of us”. British poet Stephen Spender organised a telegram of support from artists and intellectuals including fellow poet WH Auden, philosopher Bertrand Russell, composer Igor Stravinsky and writers JB Priestley and Mary McCarthy. Two weeks before the Red Square demonstration, Litvinov outlined proposals for a support network for “the democratic movement in the USSR”. He suggested a committee of “universally respected progressive writers, scholars, artists and public personalities” from the west to keep the fate of Soviet dissidents in the public eye. He gave his plans to Dutch human rights activist Karel van Het Reve to smuggle abroad. Litvinov’s idea was to establish an organisation in support of intellectual dissidents: a version of Amnesty International exclusively for writers, artists and academics. Many early meetings took place in the offices of the Observer, with the support of editor David Astor. But when the young translator Michael Scammell joined the organisation, the idea emerged of a magazine publishing and promote the censored work of writers worldwide. The first issue appeared (with Scammell as editor) in spring 1972 and included poetry from Gorbanevskaya, recently released from the psychiatric hospital, and two short pieces from the most celebrated anti-Soviet writer of all, Alexander Solzhenitsyn. If Vladimir Putin is inspired by his Soviet predecessors, his internal opponents should be inspired by the tiny handful of protesters who raised their banners in Moscow in 1968. I was reminded of their bravery in the early days of the invasion of Ukraine, when Sofia Rusova, co-chair of Russia’s trade union for journalists, stood alone near Red Square holding a sign reading, “War with Ukraine is Russia’s disgrace.” Despite the obvious parallels, 2022 is not the same as 1968, and Ukraine is not Czechoslovakia. There have been considerably more than eight Russians protesting against this invasion and still they braved a Soviet-style crackdown on demonstrators to come out in numbers in the Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine and Russia itself. Critical outlets such as Dozhd (TV-Rain) and radio station Ekho Moskvy have stopped broadcasting. But Novaya Gazeta, whose editor, Dmitri Muratov, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021, is still publishing, as has the Moscow Times. Encrypted electronic media such as messaging apps Telegram and Signal make a total blackout impossible. Rusova, the lone Moscow demonstrator, has not been carted off to a psychiatric ward and has gone on posting updates about media freedom via social media. In 1992, after the fall of the Berlin wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Pavel Litvinov wrote in Index magazine: “Only a few people understood at the time that these individual protests were becoming part of a movement the Soviet authorities would never be able to eradicate.” The heirs to Gorbanevskaya and Litvinov have taken to the streets of Russia, and Index on Censorship will be proud to amplify their voices.

3/27/2022,"Judge a political party by the choices it makes. Rishi Sunak may plead that no chancellor could protect everyone from a cost of living crisis driven by events outside his and the country’s control. But he protests too much. There were two realities as he composed the spring statement that he presented last week. First was the warning from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that British households faced the most severe drop in living standards for 66 years. Second was the unexpected good news that, far from being in a tight fiscal spot, there was a revenue bonanza that would carry the budget deficit in four years’ time to the lowest for a generation. The chancellor had some £30bn of financial headroom he had not expected in October. Sunak had choices, but he chose not to make them. Living standards for the poorest in our society are already desperate. Sunak could comfortably have afforded the £6bn to lift universal credit by £20 a week, restoring the valuable increase made during the pandemic. He could have indicated that he would fully index all benefits to reflect the surge in inflation that is so swelling the Treasury’s coffers. His refusal to do so, estimates the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, will pull a further 600,000 people into poverty, of whom around a quarter are children. He could have indicated that he would revisit February’s package to help households with their energy bills, given the OBR forecast of a further 40% rise in energy prices in the wake of the Ukraine war. As a result, the price cap will rise to £2,801 in October, nearly £2,000 higher than 18 months ago, equivalent to a 6p rise in the standard rate of income tax. He did none of these, contenting himself with raising the fund available to local authorities to assist vulnerable people by a mere £500m. After taking all the measures into account, including the concessions on national insurance and fuel duty, the typical working-age household will see its income fall next year by 4%, or £1,100, according to the Resolution Foundation. But the poorest quarter of households will see their income fall 6%, taking 1.3 million into absolute poverty. These numbers are breathtaking, but avoidable. The Trussell Trust reports that 600,000 more people used food banks in 2021, taking the grand total to more than 2.5 million. That number will surely rise at least another 600,000 in 2022 to more than 3 million. Yet Britain is one of the richest countries on Earth. What kind of society are we creating that we are prepared to live with such poverty in our midst? For the Tory party, what matters is not the condition of the people but the drive for tax cuts and the shoehorning of every policy ambition into the straitjacket of artificial constraints on debt. A moral and effective social policy is the also-ran. It is a carelessness born of profound cynicism. There are many Britons with every reason to believe that they should not live in a society that makes so many choose between eating, clothing or staying warm. But prevailing Conservative practice indicts their poverty as a matter of choice; they should pull themselves up by their bootstraps into self-reliance. But as we learned from the pandemic, the rich cannot insulate themselves from poor people crowded into multi-occupied decrepit housing, incubating the virus. Self-interest alone demands we all care. The doctrine of self-help ignores the reality that for the poor the struggle is just to survive. But beyond that, acknowledgement of reciprocal obligation to our fellow citizens defines our humanity. There is a collective “we” beyond the “I” demanding tax cuts. By their choices we shall know them. Last week, the Conservative party’s choices, and their impact, were laid bare.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on Rishi Sunak’s spring statement | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/27/observer-view-rishi-sunak-spring-statement
