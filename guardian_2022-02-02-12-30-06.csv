2/2/2022,"Children in Afghanistan are rummaging through bins looking for plastic to sell while women sit in the middle of busy roads begging for food, spurring fresh calls for the Australian government to ramp up assistance to the poverty-hit country. Fiona McSheehy, an aid worker currently based in Afghanistan, told Australian senators on Wednesday she had witnessed “desperately heartbreaking” scenes over the past three months, as humanitarian groups warn of rising poverty and famine.  The acting country director for Afghanistan at Save the Children, addressing a Senate hearing in Canberra by videoconference, said half of Afghanistan’s population was aged under 18 and “they have no real future at the moment”. “I’ve been involved in humanitarian work for more than two decades now and this is by far and away the most complicated and also deeply saddening situation I’ve ever been in,” McSheehy said. “I’ve been here for about three months. Since I arrived, I have seen the number of children on the street increase dramatically. You see them rooting through things like rubbish bins to try to find things that they can then sell – plastic and things like that. “We see them lined up in streets begging as people try to get to the airport, and they’re selling face masks one by one – that’s how desperate they are for an income.” McSheehy, who has also travelled to some of the provinces, said during her time in Afghanistan she had seen “more poverty and more desperation”. “Every now again you’ll see a woman and her children just sitting in the middle of the road begging for food and money, while cars and lorries drive either side of them. It is desperately heartbreaking,” she said. McSheehy also told the hearing that each morning the streets of Kabul were lined with men sitting in wheelbarrows waiting for a day of work. She said if she went back three hours later, most of those men were still there waiting – because there was no work. That meant it was hard for parents to feed their children, she told the Senate’s foreign affairs, defence and trade references committee, which is continuing its inquiry into Australia’s engagement in Afghanistan.

Mat Tinkler, the acting chief executive of Save the Children Australia, described the situation in Afghanistan as a “living hell”. He said on Wednesday there were now 13.1 million children in need of humanitarian aid – an increase of 3.1 million children in just three months. “Senators, we are watching the world’s largest humanitarian crisis unfold right now and every day the risk to an increasing number of children’s lives becomes both more severe and more urgent,” he said. Tinkler said 22.8 million people – almost the entire population of Australia – were “on the brink of famine”. By the middle of the year, more than 95% of the population could be living in poverty. He asked what it would take for the Australian government to do more to try to avoid this catastrophe.

That left about $13m in new funding dedicated to the crisis this year. “For context we spent $10bn over two decades on our military engagement, so half a billion dollars a year in funding, in Afghanistan,” Tinkler said. “I think the world and Australia needs to ask itself, are we comfortable watching this tragedy unfold, are we comfortable watching a projected 1 million children die this year of malnutrition?” Tim Watkin, the head of government relations at the Australian Council for International Development, described it as an “escalating humanitarian crisis”. Nadine Haddad, a senior policy adviser to World Vision Australia, said the severity of the situation in Afghanistan was “far too much for anyone to comprehend”. She emphasised the importance of aid to directly help people in need, with safeguards to ensure money did not go to the Taliban leadership, but added: “The priority of humanity must take over.”",News/Australia news,‘Living hell’: Australia urged to ramp up Afghanistan aid as humanitarian crisis unfolds,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/living-hell-australia-urged-to-ramp-up-afghanistan-aid-as-humanitarian-crisis-unfolds
2/2/2022,"An SAS soldier has told the federal court he saw Ben Roberts-Smith order another Australian soldier to execute an unarmed, kneeling Afghan man during a raid on a village in 2009. The soldier, still a member of the SAS and anonymised in the court as Person 41, said he was part of a raid that was clearing a compound in Afghanistan known as Whiskey 108 on Easter Sunday 2009.  He was investigating a room in the compound where he had discovered bomb-making materials and opium when he emerged into a courtyard to see Roberts-Smith and another soldier, known as Person 4, standing above a kneeling elderly Afghan male, near the entrance to a tunnel. Person 41 told the court that Roberts-Smith and Person 4 asked him for the suppressor from his M4 rifle, which he lent to Person 4, presuming he was going to investigate the tunnel as a potential hideout for insurgents. Person 4 did not go into the tunnel. Person 41 said: “RS [Roberts-Smith] walked down and grabbed the Afghan male by the scruff of his shirt.” Person 41 said Roberts-Smith walked the man about two metres until he was in front of Person 4, “then kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down … RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’.” Person 41 said he did not want to witness what he realised was about to occur, and stepped back into the room where he had previously been. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle – “I’ve fired thousands of those rounds and I know what they sound like”. He waited another “15 or so seconds” before stepping back into the courtyard. Person 41 said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. He inspected the body. “There was quite a lot of blood flowing from the head wound.” Person 4 handed back Person 41’s suppressor, which was warm from having been used. The two Australian soldiers did not speak. “He seemed to be in a bit of shock to me.” Before giving his evidence, Person 41 sought, and was granted by the judge, a certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act, protecting him against self-incrimination. Person 4 is scheduled to give evidence, on behalf of the newspapers, later in the trial. Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial recommenced Wednesday in the federal court after another months-long delay caused by Covid restrictions and lockdown. During earlier evidence before the court, Roberts-Smith was questioned over the alleged murder of the elderly man inside the compound. He said he never ordered the man shot and allegations he had were “completely false”. The events of Easter Sunday 2009, in Whiskey 108, in a village known as Kakarak in Uruzgan province, have emerged as central to the allegations made against Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross winner, and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers have also alleged that during the same raid on Whiskey 108, Roberts-Smith dragged another detained Afghan man – who had a prosthetic leg – outside the compound, threw him to the ground, and shot him with a machine-gun “10 to 15 times”. Roberts-Smith says he killed the man with the prosthetic leg, but that he was an insurgent, running outside the compound, and carrying a weapon. Roberts-Smith insists the man was a legitimate target, a threat to soldiers’ safety, and was killed within the laws of war. The prosthetic leg was later souvenired by another soldier and used as a drinking vessel at the Australian soldiers’ unofficial bar on base, the Fat Ladies’ Arms. Roberts-Smith said he never drank from the leg, though conceded in court he “contributed to and encouraged a culture where it was acceptable to drink from the leg”. He has been photographed alongside soldiers who were drinking from the leg. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith ‘ordered Australian soldier to execute unarmed Afghan man’, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/ben-roberts-smith-ordered-australian-soldier-to-execute-unarmed-afghan-man-court-hears
2/2/2022,"If one was looking for a motive for the extraordinary leak of text messages describing the prime minister, Scott Morrison, as “a horrible, horrible person”, “a fraud” and a “psycho”, then the wild factional brawl within the New South Wales division of the Liberals is a good place to start. “This is a major hit job by NSW on Morrison and his offsider, [Alex] Hawke,” one senior NSW Liberal said of the blue-on-blue attack.  Morrison also upped the ante. During a chat with 2GB’s Ray Hadley he publicly threatened federal intervention in the NSW division. “If they can’t endorse [federal environment minister Sussan Ley] they should get out of the way and let the federal executive ensure we can get things done,” the prime minister said. On Monday, the state executive rebuffed a motion designed in the prime minister’s office to automatically re-endorse three sitting members, including Ley. The NSW Liberal party, arguably the most dysfunctional branch in the country, is in the final stages of trying to carve up the spoils for the next federal election: eight safe or winnable seats that could guarantee careers in federal parliament for years. The choices could determine whether Morrison holds or picks up seats in NSW. Understandably he wants a say. The problem is the rules don’t give him one. The composition of the parliamentary party will also determine the balance of internal power within the three factions in the NSW Liberal party – the moderates, the right and the centre right. This will determine the policy direction of the Liberals in the future. But more immediately, it’s also about the influence of those who rule within the party behind the scenes. Despite the federal election being due by May, party mechanisms have been seized up by obstruction. It has now reached a crisis point, with factional organisers unable to deliver on a complex peace deal on who will be candidates. This threatens to expose their own weakness and could implode the NSW division. The prime minister, a former state director of the NSW Liberals, and Hawke – his immigration minister who is also the convener of the centre-right faction, the PM’s power base – are at the very heart of this internal toxic dispute. Hawke, who represents the prime minister on a crucial vetting committee, is being blamed by all for the delays in choosing candidates by failing to make himself available to scrutinise candidates. Some think the pair are engineering a crisis so the PM can pick candidates. The other factor is the relatively new rules which were designed to insert democracy into preselections. Plebiscites of all branch members are required under new rules, but the results are unpredictable or in some cases undesirable to some. These have been delayed by Hawke’s actions to the point they may no longer be possible. In the branches, members are furious. The right and the moderates are desperately trying to stitch together a grand bargain that satisfies everyone, to no avail. Candidates are now withdrawing, fearing the seats are unwinnable, and there are threats of legal action from members over the breach of the new rules. So when texts allegedly sent between the former premier, Gladys Berejiklian and “a cabinet minister” were lobbed into the public domain on Tuesday via a question at the press club in Canberra, the fingers immediately pointed to one of the most prominent factional players in NSW: Matt Kean – the NSW treasurer, Berejiklian confidante and moderate convener. On Wednesday morning on 2GB’s Ben Fordham show, Kean denied he was the leaker. “I played no part in the ambush of the prime minister. It was not me,” he said. It was “completely insulting” to suggest he was behind the text messages, Keen told Fordham. But as to whether the text exchange was between him and Berejiklian, Kean fell back on a form of words that were less unequivocal. “I’ve been through my messages, I’ve got no reason to believe I’ve ever referred to the prime minister that way,” he said. Berejiklian said she couldn’t recall the exchange. But this is not accidental and its delivery at a televised event ensured maximum media follow-up. Those of us who have peaked inside the feudal court of the NSW Liberals can vouch that the prime minister and Hawke are extremely unpopular with many right and moderate factional figures. On the right, many feel Hawke’s actions – which have effectively delayed preselections – are about engineering a crisis and denying branch members democracy. Among the moderates, the dominant faction, there is equal frustration as they blame the prime minister for upsetting the more recent peace deal. Others see in the leak an attempt to distance the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, from the prime minister and his record on Covid-19 planning, the related economic slowdown and women’s issues. Perrottet’s electoral test will come sooner, with four state byelections scheduled for 12 February. But for Perrottet, there are risks he too could be tarnished in the eyes of the electorate by the organisational division’s infighting. There’s an old adage in politics: if you can’t govern yourself, you can’t govern the country. Voters might not follow the ins and outs of factional wars, but they know it causes paralysis in governments, pollutes who gets preselected to represent them and leads to cronyism within a political party. In short, they hate internal bickering. So if someone in the NSW or federal Liberals thought this was a smart strategy, they probably need to get out more.",News/Australia news,Leaking explosive text messages won’t solve the Liberals’ toxic internal dispute | Anne Davies,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/leaking-explosive-text-messages-wont-solve-the-liberals-toxic-internal-dispute
2/2/2022,"Two heads have been stolen from separate graves in a Melbourne cemetery, with police saying the grisly crime has distressed the families of those whose bodies were disturbed. It is not believed anything else was taken from the coffins, which were located in mausoleums in Footscray cemetery.  Victoria Police acting inspector Ben Jarman said the first theft occurred overnight between 27 January and 28 January, and the second between Monday night and Tuesday morning. The thefts occurred at mausoleums towards the rear of the cemetery, and were reported to police after passersby noticed graves had been damaged. “It is very distressing for the families, obviously they weren’t expecting this news to come from Victoria Police,” Jarman said. “They expect their loved ones to be put to rest, at peace.” There were no known links between the two people whose graves were targeted, Jarman said. A third grave site was also disturbed, but it was a pre-purchased plot that did not contain human remains. Jarman said police were unclear about the motive for the crime, which constituted theft and removal of body part offences, but he was not ruling out that it was linked to satanism. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Because it’s such an uncommon crime to be committed, until we catch up with the offender and find out a motive, it’s very difficult to say what the motive is,” he said. Jarman was not aware of similar cases occurring in Victoria, but said that would form part of the investigation. It is unclear how many people are involved in the offences, which occurred when the cemetery could only be accessed by foot, but it is expected tools were used to access the remains. There had been items left at the scene by the offenders, Jarman said. “It is difficult to say whether they are acting alone, there is a … lot of work to get into these mausoleums, there was a substantial amount of damage, but too early to say at this stage.” Jarman said police would increase patrols in the area, and the local council was working with the cemeteries trust to improve security, including by installing CCTV.",News/Australia news,Two human heads stolen from graves in Melbourne cemetery,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/two-human-heads-stolen-from-graves-in-melbourne-cemetery
