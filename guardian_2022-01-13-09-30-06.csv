1/13/2022,"Endemic ill-health in England’s “left behind” neighbourhoods costs the country almost £30bn a year because people are often too ill to work and die earlier, a report claims. The cost of lost productivity results directly from those very deprived areas having much worse health than the rest of the country, according to parliamentarians and academics.  Experts from the Northern Health Science Alliance (NHSA) have calculated that the economy would grow by that amount if health in those areas was improved to such an extent that local people began to enjoy the same health as those in better-off places. Thursday’s report, by the NHSA and all-party parliamentary group for left behind neighbourhoods (LBNs), highlights the scale of the challenge Boris Johnson faces in meeting his pledge to level up England’s poorest and richest areas. “The health of people living in left behind neighbourhoods is considerably worse than the health of people living in the rest of the country,” said Dr Luke Munford, the report’s lead author and a lecturer in health economics at the University of Manchester. “This is true across all measures of health.” The report shows rates of obesity, lung conditions, high blood pressure, mental health problems and other diseases are much higher than the national average in the 225 LBNs. This means people there have less “healthy life expectancy” and also shorter lives and thus are less productive over their lifespan than those elsewhere. For example, men in the poorest areas die on average 3.7 years earlier than their counterparts in the rest of England while women live three years fewer. Both sexes in those regions also typically live 7.5 years less in good health – free of disease and disability – than those in better-off places, which also limits their ability to work, while 9.1% of people say their health is “bad” or “very bad” compared with 5.5% in England as a whole. Despite that, people in LBNs work the longest hours in England, the authors found. They spend an average of 36.9 hours a week working, a little more than those elsewhere. However, they earn less and are sometimes in areas of high unemployment, which can depress wages, the report said. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, has described the stark disparities in health as “the disease of disparity” and pledged to make tackling them a key element of the government’s levelling up strategy. However, publication of a white paper setting out the detail of how levelling-up would be achieved by the time of the next general election in 2024 was delayed last year and is due soon. The 225 places have been identified as left behind neighbourhoods by combining data from the Community Needs Index with that from the Index of Multiple Deprivation. They have poor physical and digital connectivity, low community engagement and a lack of community spaces, as well as high levels of social and economic deprivation. They are mainly post-industrial areas of the Midlands and north of England as well as coastal towns. The co-chairs of the group are Paul Howell, the Conservative MP for Sedgefield in Durham – Tony Blair’s old seat, and Dame Diana Johnson, the Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull. The researchers found that people in LBNs have much lower gross added value – a measure of productivity – than those elsewhere. That and other factors, such as poorer educational attainment, mean that the £20,400 they earned on average in 2018 was £8,256 less than the rest of England. Given that just over 15 million people live in the 225 LBNs, the total loss of productivity relative to the rest of the country is £124.1bn a year, the academics calculated. The 23.8% of that sum that can be directly explained by worse outcomes in local council areas containing at least one LBN equates to £29.8bn. “It is unacceptable that those living in the poorest areas of the country can expect to die more than a decade earlier than those in wealthier areas,” said David Finch, the assistant director of healthy lives at the Health Foundation thinktank. “Only 47% of people with a health condition or disability that limits their ability to work are in employment, compared with 81% of those without. And areas with high levels of income deprivation have greater concentrations of poor health. For example, in Hartlepool in the north-east, 21% of working-age people have a work limiting disability compared to 11% in Hillingdon in London,” Finch added. He urged ministers to use a “whole government approach”, in which every department plays its part in reducing health inequalities if they hoped to succeed. That would involve helping low-income families to cope with the rising cost of living and ensuring that long-term investment in infrastructure is designed to promote good health, he added. “Without this, levelling up is likely to remain little more than a slogan.” David Buck, an expert in health inequalities at the King’s Fund, said: “What is really needed is a much longer term and strategic look at how government finance reaches areas of the greatest need over time as a matter of course, not a beauty contest; how high-quality businesses are attracted to these areas and stick there; and how social infrastructure is valued and boosted and is not seen as a cost on the public purse but a long-term investment in people’s health and in their productivity.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",News/Inequality,"Ill health in ‘left behind’ areas costs England £30bn a year, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2022/jan/13/ill-health-in-left-behind-areas-costs-england-30bn-a-year-says-report
1/13/2022,"Millions of older people in the UK are facing an energy emergency, with a leading charity saying people are being forced to switch off their heating, limit hot showers and live off soup and sandwiches to pay their increased energy bills. Age UK has urged ministers to take immediate and decisive action to “mitigate the potentially devastating impact of the escalating crisis” caused by rising energy bills, which could go up by another 50% in April.  In a letter this week to Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, and Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, the charity said it was concerned that “many older people on low incomes already feel under so much financial pressure that they are rationing their energy use”. “For example, we have heard from older people who are too worried to use their oven and are living off soup and sandwiches instead, showering only every two days rather than daily, and constantly watching their smart meter and turning their heating off once their daily spending exceeds the meagre limit they have set,” Age UK said. Older energy bill payers are more likely to live in fuel poverty, which is expected to reach record highs in the UK this year because of increased gas and electricity costs. The global gas crisis caused the fastest rise in energy bills on record in October, and the average bill could increase further by April to cover the cost of bankrupt suppliers. Consumer groups and energy suppliers have repeatedly called on the government to act. Their proposals include the Treasury cutting the 5% rate of VAT on energy bills, moving green levies into general taxation, and helping to defer the cost of protecting customers affected by the collapse of dozens of suppliers in recent months. Age UK said the government must reassure older householders that they would not “face an energy bill in the spring that will be beyond their means to pay”. Age UK’s charity director, Caroline Abrahams, said: “The astronomical hike in energy prices now widely anticipated has already forced many deeply anxious older people on low incomes to turn their heating down below what is comfortable or advisable, with some switching it off altogether for some or all of the day and night. “This situation will have a devastating impact on the health of our older population unless the government intervenes quickly and takes their fears away.” She added: “Ministers will have to go considerably further than offering token gestures of financial support such as adding £10 a year to the Warm Home Discount Scheme from next year. Energy price rises on the scale we are now seeing are unprecedented and the government’s response must be equal to the threat they pose to older people living on low and modest incomes.” Age UK has urged older people to call its free national advice line before turning their heating off or down to make sure they are receiving all the financial support available.

1/13/2022,"Ovo Energy is moving to cut a quarter of its entire workforce in an attempt to cut costs amid the growing industry crisis. The UK’s third-biggest supplier of gas and electricity is expected to announce the loss of 1,700 roles out of 6,200 as part of a voluntary redundancy scheme as soon as Thursday. Gas market prices last month reached an all-time high of £4.50 per therm, about nine times higher than this time last year.  Earlier this week the company said it was “embarrassed” after an email was sent out advising customers to keep their heating bills low by “having a cuddle with your pets”, eating “hearty bowls of porridge” and “doing a few star jumps”. The redundancy scheme, first reported by Sky News, will be announced alongside a pledge to increase minimum pay across the company to £12 an hour, and to “reshore” all customer-facing jobs to the UK. It is also understood that Ovo is to open an academy in Glasgow as well as consolidate its sites to three locations in London, Bristol and Glasgow. Record wholesale price increases for gas and electricity have prompted the government to look into ways of mitigating the effect on the cost of living in Britain. Campaigners fear fuel poverty could reach its highest level since records began without government intervention, warning that 6 million UK homes may be unable to pay energy bills after a further price hike in spring. Ovo, which has about 4.5 million UK customers, was set up by Stephen Fitzpatrick in 2009 and was acquired by SSE’s retail customer base two years ago. It is the third-biggest energy firm behind Centrica’s British Gas and E.ON Next, the brand combining customers of E.ON and npower. It is also backed by the Japanese industrial group Mitsubishi.

If you’re after breaking news, you won’t find it here (head over to our live blog for that) and if you’re already thinking about lunch, why not give Felicity Cloake’s chana masala a crack. If you’re using tinned chickpeas, it’ll be ready just in time. Now, on to the reads. Marijuana has been legal to grow in the US state of Oregon since 2015. So, why are massive, illegal grow operations booming? The characters: “For a bespectacled middle-aged conservationist, Christopher Hall is surprisingly reckless,” Felisa Rogers writes. With a team of just three detectives, Josephine county sheriff Dave Daniel doesn’t have the staffing power to properly tackle the problem. “Have you ever seen the movie Animal House?” he asks. “Kevin Bacon is in his little … uniform and he’s got his hands in the air and he says, ‘Remain calm, all is well,’ and then completely gets mowed over by the crowd? That’s me.” Cedar Grey and his wife, Madrone, own a legal farm, and he has been growing cannabis in the area since 1998. “I mean it’s really, really strange for me to be calling for a huge law enforcement or military crackdown on growing marijuana because for so long I just wanted it to be free for people to grow,” Cedar says. “But what’s happening here has to stop.” How long will it take me to read? About five minutes. With healthcare systems under pressure from Australia’s soaring Covid numbers, it can be difficult to know when to seek help. Here, doctors share the symptoms to look out for. Helpful suggestion: “Now is a good time to prepare a Covid-safe plan should you or a household member get Covid and be isolating for a period of time,” says Dr Karen Price, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. “This would include having ready access to the guidelines as well as isolation needs, food, fluids, pets and medications.” Wandering the streets of Paris, crippled by self-loathing and negative thoughts, the novelist Sarah Moss found reprieve in the form of a silver dragonfly bracelet. Notable quote: “I wasn’t sure it would work,” Moss writes of her day off in the city. “I knew myself perfectly capable of walking the streets hour after hour telling myself that any competent person would be enjoying museums and shops and cafes and what kind of privileged neurotic steals a day from her work and her family and then doesn’t even have the guts to buy a croissant … ” How long will it take me to read? About three minutes Meet the young men getting vasectomies for environmental reasons. Is this really a thing? “Nick Demediuk [is] an Australian GP and one of the world’s most prolific vasectomy clinicians,” writes Simon Usborne. While “most of his patients are fathers over the age of 35 … the doctor, who has completed more than 40,000 procedures since 1981, now estimates that about 200 of the 4,000 patients his clinic sees each year are younger men without kids. About 130 of them say they are doing it for the planet.” Isn’t it a bit extreme? From a medical standpoint, it’s actually a pretty low-key procedure. “The operation … is now typically bloodless; there is no scalpel involved. … The process takes 15 minutes and is more than 99% effective.” Also: “Vasectomies address the gender imbalance that still accompanies the choice and practice of birth control. They come with less risk than more invasive and less reliable methods of female contraception.” How long will it take me to read? About six minutes. In the final part (for now) of our summer series A Day at the Beach, we meet Feather – a Byron Bay legend – who tells us about the day she scattered her husband’s ashes. Notable quote: “He always said he’d come back as a sea eagle and I always look up when I’m at the beach. They are so often above me and I think, ‘There he is, he’s there.’” How long will it take me to read?

1/13/2022,"“Idon’t know how you do your job,” is a common sentiment oncologists hear from those who assume that treating cancer must be uniformly depressing. But this is not the whole truth. The real gratification comes from accompanying patients on a tough journey and staying the course. Which is why I rush to intensive care when I hear that one of my long-term patients has been admitted overnight.  While I was away, her disease progressed. She had begun aggressive chemotherapy and days later, she fell ill. Expecting a conversation about a temporary setback, I encounter a gravely ill woman who is intubated, with failing organs, on maximal life support. Her family has been allowed in for a glimpse. Our long association makes the exchange hard. I tell them that the next 24 hours will be critical and even if she survives, there is difficulty ahead. The misgivings have already begun – should she have had the chemo? How could a person go from working to dying in a matter of days? Did we or they miss a red flag? Her husband and children ask probing questions, but they are polite, restrained and incredibly gracious. We’re so glad you’re back, the husband says. She missed you. I sense genuine affection but also the silent hope that now that I am back I will unravel the disaster. The responsibility feels enormous. Behind the masks and shields, our eyes are moist. A few hours later, the intensive care doctor calls. She’s very unwell, he says before getting to the real point. “I am asking you if we can make an early call to palliate and discharge her from ICU.” “When?” “Now.” My disbelief must be open because it prompts the rueful explanation that a Covid patient needs an intensive care bed. The pieces fall together instantly. With intensive care at capacity, I am being asked to move my patient to make room for another. “After all, your patient does have incurable cancer.” My bile rises. And even as I know it’s a petty question, I can’t help asking: “Is the Covid patient vaccinated?” “No,” he says wearily. “That’s why he is so sick.” Recriminations flood my mind, but this is no time for argument. I have deep regard for an old colleague who feels ethically conflicted and is asking for my help. I am torn between respecting his predicament and honouring my patient. He agrees that absent a pandemic, if I had suggested withdrawing care, he would have counselled hanging on a little longer. And he concedes that while many of my patients die prematurely, it is important for the family to know that we did all we could. To change course merely hours after our bedside conversation would multiply this family’s grief. In turn, I understand that for a chance at survival, the Covid patient needs a ventilator. “So, let’s make your position really clear for the night shift.” By nature, I seek consensus and I’d like nothing more than to relieve my colleague’s obvious stress. But in a career filled with ethical dilemmas, this one really tugs at me. Only my word stands between the trajectory of a patient’s life and how her family will forever recall the experience. I am staggered by a power that I never sought, and it makes me queasy. Keeping my voice steady, I say: “If you are asking for my permission to withdraw care tonight, I can’t give it. My patient may have cancer, but she deserves a chance.” As I worry about alienating him, his voice breaks. “I hope that if asked, my parent’s oncologist would make the exact same decision.” The revelation leaves me speechless but with patients to see, there will have to be another time to ask after him. Much is being said about the courage and sacrifice of health professionals to keep the healthcare system running but almost all of us would rather be on the frontline than anywhere else. When we enter the profession, we consecrate ourselves to serving humanity – there could not be a better time to do this. From the students rolling up their sleeves to the specialists redirected to treat Covid patients, not to mention all the nurses, paramedics and service staff sustaining a threatened workforce, this is an extraordinary and privileged time to be on the frontline. But truth be told, we will spare the kitchen orchestra and the free drinks in exchange for a genuine reckoning with the difficulties we are facing. Often, medicine, needs to fix up its own troubles. But this time, there is something every individual has the power to do. There is strong evidence of the efficacy of vaccines in protecting against severe illness and death. Even with the more infectious Omicron variant, the fully vaccinated are less unwell and have a greater chance of leaving hospital for home. The collective request from a concerned and tired workforce to the public is: get vaccinated, get your booster and keep up sensible precautions. No one wants to be in the invidious position of deciding whether to save you or the next patient. (Yes, rationing happens everywhere but it doesn’t have to be as egregious.) My patient died quickly in intensive care. When we spoke, her family was grateful for our compassion and care and could not fault the system. We don’t know what happened to the other patient. If he endured a prolonged wait, his family might feel let down by the delay, though his certain extended stay in intensive care will impact the next patient. I doubt this will be any consolation to anyone, least of all those who must actually make the difficult decisions.
