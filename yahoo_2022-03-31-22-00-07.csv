3/31/2022,"Several hundred Russian soldiers were forced to hastily withdraw from the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine after suffering “acute radiation sickness” from contaminated soil, according to Ukrainian officials. The troops, who reportedly dug trenches in a contaminated Red Forest near the site of the worst nuclear disaster in history, are now being treated in a special medical facility in Gomel, Belarus. The forest is so named because thousands of pine trees turned red during the 1986 nuclear disaster. The area is considered so highly toxic that not even highly specialized Chernobyl workers are allowed to enter the zone. Local reports suggest that seven buses with the zapped troops arrived in Gomel early Thursday. Journalists on the ground have also reported “ghost buses” of dead soldiers being transported from Belarus to Russia under the cover of dark. Ukraine Admits It’s ‘Impossible’ to Say if Chernobyl Is Safe U.S. intelligence reported Wednesday that Russian forces began withdrawing from the defunct site. Russia said the withdrawal from Chernobyl was part of a pledge to scale back the invasion. But Ukrainian media says it is actually because the troops were “irradiated” from the contaminated soil. “Another batch of Russian irradiated terrorists who seized the Chernobyl zone was brought to the Belarusian Radiation Medicine Center in Gomel today,” Yaroslav Yemelianenko, who works for the Public Council at the State Agency of Ukraine for Exclusion Zone Management, posted on Facebook. “There are rules for dealing with this territory.” The Chernobyl facility fell to Russian control on Feb. 24, the first day of the invasion. Workers were on duty for more than 600 hours before being allowed a shift change. International concern grew immediately when Russian troops moved heavy military hardware through the area, kicking up radioactive dust without any protective equipment. Forest fires in the area also raised concern about environmental contamination. Digging trenches in the forest—considered the most contaminated area of the site—drew widespread ridicule from Ukrainians who work at the site. The debacle is the latest in a series of missteps by the Russian troops struggling to keep their footing in their increasingly failed war. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/31/2022,"Russian troops in Ukraine appear to be using twigs, hay, and saplings to cover their vehicles. One video on social media shows a Russian vehicle taped with saplings, per The Washington Post. In comparison, Ukrainian troops have been using camouflage nets to obscure themselves in the war. Russian forces in Ukraine appear to be using carpets, saplings, and hay to cover their armored vehicles in what could be a sign they haven't been provided adequate camouflage equipment, The Washington Post reported Wednesday. One video on social media apparently depicting a firefight shows a military vehicle with pine saplings sparsely taped to its side, per The Post. Another video, also identified by The Post, depicts Russian troops covering an armored vehicle with tarpaulin and carpets. Several images of a Russian convoy crossing into the eastern Donbas region the day before the war began also show the roofs of military vehicles covered with straw. Another photo shows a Russian armored vehicle in the convoy topped with twigs. Rob Lee, an expert on the Russian military, told The Post that the absence of camouflage netting among some Russian forces showed a surprising lack of preparation and perhaps an initial overconfidence from their military leaders. The US military has used camouflage nets since the 1990s and recently upgraded them to fit woodland, snow, and desert environments. Ukrainian troops have also been using such nets, with civilians even helping to weave them for use on the frontline. The quality of Russia's troops and equipment has come into question in the weeks after Russian President Vladimir Putin initiated a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called Russia's army ""incompetent,"" adding that Moscow was ""driving their people to slaughter"" and that Ukrainian troops had inflicted ""unprecedented losses"" upon the invaders. Russian casualties have continued to mount in a war that has almost certainly lasted far longer than the Kremlin anticipated. A NATO official estimated on March 24 that at least 40,000 Russian troops had been killed, captured or injured in the invasion.

3/31/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Thursday signed a decree ordering 134,500 new conscripts into the army as part of Russia's annual spring draft, but the defence ministry said the call-up had nothing to do with the war in Ukraine. The order came five weeks into Russia's invasion, which has run into fierce Ukrainian resistance. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Tuesday that none of those called up would be sent to any ""hot spots"". The issue of conscripts' involvement in the war is highly sensitive. On March 9, the defence ministry acknowledged that some had been sent to Ukraine after Putin had denied this on various occasions, saying only professional soldiers and officers had been sent in. Putin's spokesman said at the time that the president had ordered military prosecutors to investigate and punish the officials responsible for disobeying his instructions to exclude conscripts. The annual spring military draft, which runs from April 1 to July 15, will affect Russian men between the ages of 18 and 27, Putin's decree said. Shoigu said on Tuesday that those called up would begin to be dispatched to their assigned bases in late May. ""Most military personnel will undergo professional training in training centres for three to five months. Let me emphasize that recruits will not be sent to any hot spots,"" he said in remarks published on his ministry's website. However, Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer representing several members of Russia's National Guard who refused an order to go to Ukraine, said that under Russian law conscripts could be sent to fight after several months of training. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. The war has killed thousands of people and uprooted millions. In recent days Russia has reframed its objectives, saying it never intended to take the capital Kyiv and other major cities but is focused on ""liberating"" eastern areas where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting the Ukrainian army since 2014. Its statements have been greeted sceptically by Ukraine and Western governments. Military analysts have suggested the declared focus on the eastern Donbas region may be an attempt to make it easier for Putin to seek a face-saving exit.
