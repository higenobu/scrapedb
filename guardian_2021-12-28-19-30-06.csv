12/28/2021,"Omicron is “not the same disease we were seeing a year ago” and high Covid death rates in the UK are “now history”, a leading immunologist has said. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and the government’s life sciences adviser, said that although hospitalisations had increased in recent weeks as Omicron spreads through the population, the disease “appears to be less severe and many people spend a relatively short time in hospital”. Fewer patients were needing high-flow oxygen and the average length of stay was down to three days, he said.  A number of scientists have criticised the government’s decision not to introduce further Covid restrictions in England ahead of New Year’s Eve, with some describing it as “the greatest divergence between scientific advice and legislation” since the start of the pandemic. They have expressed concern that while the Omicron variant appears to be milder, it is highly transmissible, meaning hospital numbers and deaths could rise rapidly without intervention. The NHS Providers chief executive, Chris Hopson, said it was still unclear what would happen when infection rates in older people started to rise. “We’ve had a lot of intergenerational mixing over Christmas, so we all are still waiting to see, are we going to see a significant number of increases in terms of the number of patients coming into hospital with serious Omicron-related disease,” he told BBC Breakfast. NHS staff absences caused by having to isolate over Omicron are also causing strain on the health service, with experts predicting up to 40% of staff in London could be off in a “worst case scenario”. “We’re now seeing a significant increase in the level of staff absences, and quite a few of our chief executives are saying that they think that that’s probably going to be a bigger problem and a bigger challenge for them than necessarily the number of people coming in who need treatment because of Covid,” said Hopson. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said the government was keeping the level of Covid hospital admissions under “very close review”. He acknowledged that infection rates from the new Omicron variant were rising but said there was evidence it was not resulting in the same level of hospital admissions as previous waves. “There is early encouragement from what we know in South Africa that you have fewer hospitalisations and that the number of days that they stay in hospital if they do go into hospital is also lower than in previous variants,” he told the BBC. “At the moment we don’t think that the evidence supports any more interventions beyond what we have done. But obviously we have got to keep it under very close review, because if it is the case that we started to see a big increase in hospitalisations then we would need to act further.” John Bell told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago of intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely, that is now history, in my view, and I think we should be reassured that that’s likely to continue.” He said that over the course of multiple waves of Covid, including Delta and Omicron, “the incidence of severe disease and death from this disease has basically not changed since we all got vaccinated”. He added that quiet streets over the past couple of weeks showed people had been “pretty responsible” with regard to protecting themselves from the virus. Speaking after the government’s announcement on Monday that they would not be introducing any more Covid restrictions this year, Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, warned that the latest data was incomplete. He cautioned that the latest case figures did not include data for samples taken between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, and that it would become clear how the virus had moved through the population over the Christmas period in the coming week or so. “While nobody wants to live under tighter controls, the public need to realise that if we end up with a significant problem of hospitalisations and mass sickness, it will be worse than if authorities had acted earlier,” he said. Speaking on Tuesday, Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said people with Covid should eventually be allowed to “go about their normal lives” as they would with a common cold. “This is a disease that’s not going away. Ultimately, we’re going to have to let people who are positive with Covid go about their normal lives as they would do with any other cold,” he told BBC Breakfast. “If the self-isolation rules are what’s making the pain associated with Covid, then we need to do that perhaps sooner rather than later. Maybe not quite just yet.” Hunter said Covid would one day be regarded as a cause of the common cold and would not warrant the reporting of daily case numbers. “Once we’re past Easter, perhaps, then maybe we should start to look at scaling back, depending on, of course, what the disease is at that time,” he said.",News/World news,"Omicron is ‘not the same disease’ as earlier Covid waves, says UK scientist",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/omicron-is-not-the-same-disease-as-earlier-covid-waves-says-uk-scientist
12/28/2021,"This year has been excruciating for many Americans who have been battered by Covid, extreme weather disasters and political discord, but for one individual 2021 will be remembered for having propelled her into national prominence. Rachel Levine has shattered not one but two major glass ceilings this year. In March, she became the first openly transgender person to win confirmation in the US Senate after Joe Biden nominated her as assistant secretary of health.  Then in October she was sworn in as the first openly transgender four-star officer as an admiral and head of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. At that exalted rank she gets to wear the blue uniform of the corps, which though non-military is one of eight uniformed services. It’s been a heady 12 months, having been plucked from relative obscurity as health secretary for Pennsylvania on to the national stage. Levine’s meteoric rise is all the more impressive given how few openly trans federal officials there are in American public life. In an interview, Levine told the Guardian that she was touched not only by the honour and privilege of her new roles, but also by the “profound responsibility that I take very seriously”. She added that she would be looking to make an impact “both in terms of my advocacy through the LGBTQ+ community and also through the policy changes we can make across health and human services and the administration”. As the new head of the 6,000-strong commissioned corps, tasked with leading the federal government’s response to a multitude of health crises, Levine now finds herself in the thick of several raging disputes. Most poignantly for her, as the highest-profile trans official in the country, she is at the centre of the debate around appropriate treatments for individuals considering gender transition, especially adolescents. A graduate of Harvard and Tulane Medical School, she was trained as a pediatrician and specialised in adolescent medicine at Penn State. As such she has both personal and professional skin in the game. Levine said her starting point when thinking about trans youth was how at risk they are. “Transgender youth are very vulnerable,” she said. “They are vulnerable to being bullied, to discrimination and harassment.” Sensitive and supportive medical care has overwhelmingly positive outcomes, she said. “There is so much evidence that trans youth, when they are supported by their family and community and receive the standards of care treatment, they have excellent physical and mental health outcomes.” By contrast, “trans youth who are not accepted, do not have support from family or community, do not have access to the standard of care treatment, have big mental health issues. So we need to empower transgender youth, we need to nurture them, not discriminate against them.” In May, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced through its civil rights office that section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which bans discrimination on grounds of sex, would henceforth include sexual orientation and gender identity. The decision, which is being challenged by religious groups, requires health providers in receipt of federal funds to offer gender transition treatment. Levine said a priority for next year would be to roll out that rule change across the nation. “We are going to work to promulgate and distribute that for health insurance throughout the US,” she said. Much of the toxicity around the trans debate, Levine believes, is whipped up by partisan posturing. “A lot of this is political. There are those who are using these issues as wedge issues in the upcoming election.” She has personal experience of being targeted by such hostility. Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, was rebuked during Levine’s confirmation hearing for his “harmful misrepresentation” of transgender surgery as a form of genital mutilation. Jim Banks, a Republican congress member from Indiana, was temporarily suspended from Twitter in October for willfully misgendering Levine. In a tweet, he said: “The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man”. In addition to such politically laden hatred, Levine thinks that fear plays a large role in driving much of the transphobic agenda. “People fear what they don’t understand and have experience of. I’m hoping that my appointment, and my being open and out and working for the nation’s public health, will lead to less fear and more acceptance. That’s my goal.” How does she cope with the virulent personal attacks? She said that as a pediatrician, treating sick children, she learned how to compartmentalize. “I sublimate that. I take those challenges and I throw them into my work, and it motivates me even more.” The transgender debate is just a small part of Levine’s daily workload. There is no shortage of health crises piling up on her desk, not least the gathering storm of Omicron and the resultant battle to get millions of Americans boosted. Within the fight against Covid, Levine said she was especially ardent about addressing the health inequities that have been exposed by the pandemic. “Covid-19 like nothing else has shown the depth and breadth of health disparities in the United States, particularly among individuals of colour,” she said. She is also passionate about directing the resources of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps towards dealing with the health consequences of the climate crisis. As the crisis deepens, she said, the US is likely to be affected by the spread of vector-borne diseases such as those carried by mosquitoes. Already vulnerable communities are being assailed by extreme weather conditions. Life-threatening heatwaves have been found to disproportionately affect communities of colour. Levine highlighted the plight of many agricultural workers. “Farmworkers shouldn’t have to risk their health, even risk dying, due to extreme heat just to put food on their family’s table,” she said. “Minimum-wage workers shouldn’t have to decide between cooling their homes with electricity or paying for medication. Families across the country shouldn’t have to worry about safe drinking water.” Levine said that as the dangers of the climate crisis gather pace, the role of federal government was to help vulnerable communities build resilience. “The health equity lens is critical,” she said, “as we look at climate change and fight for environmental justice.”",News/Politics,"‘People fear what they don’t understand’: Rachel Levine, pioneering trans official, on protecting Americans’ health",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/28/rachel-levine-us-trans-health-official-profile
12/28/2021,"Next month marks the return of one of the UK’s most enduring and versatile singer-songwriters: Elvis Costello, whose new album with his band The Imposters, The Boy Named If, is out on 14 January. Alongside the release, he’ll answer Guardian readers’ questions, which you can post in the comments section below. Initially rooted in the righteous anger of the punk scene and the populism of pub rock, Costello has been a fount of strident, melodious songwriting since his breakthrough in 1977. Oliver’s Army, Pump It Up and I Don’t Want to Go to Chelsea are defining moments in the new-wave era, while ballads such as Alison remain equally celebrated.  His impeccable and far-ranging taste meant that soul, jazz and country music were also folded into his sound as the 80s progressed, but his pen remained sharp: commerce, Margaret Thatcher and – on the peerlessly beautiful Shipbuilding – the cruelty of war were among his lyrical targets. He was also a producer on classic albums for bands such as Madness, Squeeze and the Specials, and other collaborators down the years have included Paul McCartney, Burt Bacharach and Alison Krauss. Opera, New Orleans R&B, a ballet score, orchestral works, piano jazz … Costello has stayed inquisitive and adventurous in the decades since, his creativity only briefly curtailed in 2018 by an “aggressive” prostate cancer which he managed to beat. Now back into a groove of regular albums and tours, Costello, 67, is ready to answer your questions on his remarkably varied career. Post them in the comments section below by 3 January. We will publish his answers in the 7 January edition of the Film & Music print section, and also online.",Arts/Music,Post your questions for Elvis Costello,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/28/post-your-questions-for-elvis-costello
12/28/2021,"By turns fetid and febrile, pyretic and putrid, and all things hot and sticky, this unique avant garde work is the result of a collaboration between writer-director Stefan Lernous and his colleagues at Abattoir Fermé, a theatre company based in the Belgian Flemish-speaking city of Mechelen. It has a plot, of sorts: there’s a guy named Dave (Tom Vermeir, caked like everyone else in the film with white make-up that makes him look like a zombie) who looks after his family’s supposedly empty hotel, an elaborate set full of rooms encrusted with mould, grot and dead stuff, all of it in the process of mulching down into one sludgy, semi-organic mass. Perhaps the title is a clue that this is all taking place in some para-aquatic terrain, which would explain the abundance of tridents and fishtanks and other watery kit. Anyway, Dave is not entirely alone; this soggy hell has other people in it. There is an unseen neighbour who is watching some extremely noisy porn with whom Dave communicates via shouts. A young woman named Nora (Anneke Sluiters) who insists on renting a room; another husky-voiced woman (Ruth Becquart) in fleshy pantyhouse who complains that she’s bored with “fingerbanging” herself all day. Dave’s angry shouty mother (Tania Van der Sanden) is on hand, and Dave’s dead Aunt Lucy (Dirk Lavryssen) who seems to have died on a sofa some time ago, her altered state only noticed when Nora takes a closer look. Later, there are wild parties, autopsies in the kitchen, and a whole lifetime for Dave lived inside a glass case with a pretty strawberry blonde and a football team’s worth of ginger kids.  Perhaps Hotel Poseidon is meant to be someone’s nightmare or a diorama of Dave’s subconscious. But it really yields up very little in the way of actual meaning, and it was not entirely enjoyable to watch. But this film has a strange, incontrovertible integrity that demands and deserves admiration, especially for art director Sven Van Kuijk’s intricate design, and the crazy aural bricolage of screeching violins, echoes, dialogue and the sound of someone moving furniture that acts as a regular backbeat throughout.

12/28/2021,"It’s vaguely amusing to recall now that for much of the year, the very existence of this Ashes series was the subject of fraught, board-level speculation. Tense negotiations were conducted between Cricket Australia and their counterparts in England. State governments, federal government, public health experts and players all had to bestow their approval. Would the 2021-22 Ashes happen at all? Well, as it turned out, not really. Around 850 overs separated the dismissal of Rory Burns on the first morning in Brisbane and the dismissal of Jimmy Anderson on the third morning in Melbourne: the series decided in a little over nine days’ worth of cricket. And so as the victorious Australians celebrated wildly on the MCG outfield, it was possible to wonder whether they were overdoing things a touch. Was there any real satisfaction to be taken in despatching an opponent this easily? Did it not all feel a little hollow? A little comfortable? A little embarrassing?  But then perhaps we are guilty here of reducing the contest as a whole to England’s desiccated level. After all, to play Test cricket for Australia in 2021 still essentially means something. Winning Test matches for Australia still means something. The Ashes still means something, and not just as a rivalry or as a commercial concern but as a basic test of sporting ultimacy, a seeker of truth, a gauge of character. Nobody exemplified this better than Scott Boland, the country’s newest cricketing hero after taking six for seven on debut. Boland is a fine bowler and a lovely story to boot, but he will be the first to admit that none of this really made sense. Never again will he enjoy the serendipity of being able to face this opposition, on this ground, at this point in their sporting trajectory. All he really had to do was turn up on time, put his socks on and not get no-balled for throwing. And yet in running in hard and doing his best, Boland accorded this contest a measure of respect that England had long since mislaid. What does it mean to play Test cricket for England in 2021? This is a more contested question. England have issued caps to 25 players this calendar year, from Jofra Archer to James Bracey, Dan Lawrence to Dom Bess, and it has long become impossible to discern who deserves what. Somewhere amid the bubbles and the brain-fades, the revamps and the rotations, the very point of the England Test team has become somehow blunted, dissolved, obscured. None of this makes it inevitable that you will get rolled over for 68 in bright sunshine. But it certainly doesn’t help. A thought exercise: if you had to re-select an England squad for this Ashes tour, knowing what we do now, would it have been possible to do anything differently? Maybe you send out a distress flare to Dom Sibley or Liam Livingstone or even Darren Stevens. Maybe you decide not to rush a half-paced Ben Stokes back from injury. But the raw materials of this team do not fundamentally change. This is what there is. Instinctively, we want to believe that there are 11 cricketers in England capable of collectively scoring more than 68 in a completed Test innings. But maybe there aren’t. This is, after all, a game England have been playing for a while. It’s tempting to regard this as a nadir, but England were all out for 67 five Ashes Tests ago. Before that there was the 85 against Ireland, the 58 against New Zealand, eight wickets for Roston Chase, 10 wickets in a session against Bangladesh. Every time lessons were learned, approaches were altered, decks were shuffled, and the same thing happened again. Nobody gets to act surprised at any of this. Naturally, there is a certain sense of climax here. Joe Root and Chris Silverwood will probably pay for this latest debacle with their jobs. Silverwood is clearly a capable coach, but something about this team and this moment appears to have detached him from reality, like a waiter in a restaurant talking you through the specials while the kitchen slowly catches fire behind him. Root is approaching five years as captain and either there’s nothing more he can do, or he’s actually making things worse. Either way, best to move on and concentrate on the one skill in which he genuinely has a claim to greatness. And yet, what is the wider aim here? Where is the institutional will to turn this team around? Will it really come from the England and Wales Cricket Board, which derives the vast majority of its revenue from selling home Tests and short-form cricket to punters and broadcasters? Producing Test teams that win big overseas series may be very nice, but it doesn’t keep the tills ringing. Staging a high-quality County Championship at the height of summer may produce better cricketers, but it won’t keep the bonuses flowing. Besides, if you think about it, England really has no divine right to be good at this. It is by no means inevitable that England will be good at Test cricket again. This isn’t Pakistan or India. The game does not live and breathe in our streets or our public spaces or our school system. History and tradition aside, cricket does not flow through the national bloodstream any more than judo or surfing or esports. Perhaps a close parallel is with the West Indies around the turn of the century: powered by one of its greatest batsmen (for Brian Lara, read Joe Root) and two of its greatest bowlers (for Ambrose and Walsh, read Anderson and Broad), and yet infected with a basic, complacent decadence. Over time they would recover their dignity. They would be competitive. They would occasionally even win. But their true calling –driven largely by commerce and circumstance – would be to produce brilliant short-form cricketers for the global marketplace. As for Test cricket, the sun had already set and risen somewhere else. In the short term, of course, England have no greater objective than to summon the basic species pride to make the last two Tests vaguely competitive. We’re not even talking a win here. A century, a partnership, even a fifth day would feel worthwhile at this point. In the longer term, meanwhile, there are broader existential questions to be answered. What is this team for? What does it want to be? Why should people care about it? English cricket has spent years labouring under its many delusions. The greatest of all would be to assume that this is as bad as it gets.",Sport/Sport,"After awful Ashes defeat, will England ever be good at Test cricket again? | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/after-awful-ashes-defeat-will-england-will-ever-be-good-at-test-cricket-again-cricket-australia
12/28/2021,"When Britain fully left the European Union in January, it marked the start of a very difficult 12 months for the entrepreneur Rob Law, whose Trunki children’s suitcases used to sell well in mainland Europe. “We’ve had so many logistical challenges,” he said. “It’s been the perfect storm.” While trade has picked up since the start of the year, supply bottlenecks and the coronavirus Omicron variant have added to the challenges posed by the end of the transition period.  In 2021, companies across Britain have suffered from the worst trade disruption in recent memory, as problems caused by Brexit collided with the pandemic. However, it is Brexit that Law fears will have a permanent impact. “There’s always going to be more cost, more delays, it’s never going to be as smooth as it used to be,” he said. In November, the government committed to boosting UK exports of goods and services from £600bn to £1tn by 2030, under the banner “Made in the UK, sold to the world”. A year-end look at what Brexit has delivered so far suggests reaching that target will take more than a 12-point plan and a new slogan. The most up-to-date figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which cover the first 10 months of the year, show goods exports to the rest of the world are down by 14%, or more than £40bn, compared with 2019. For UK trade with the EU, exports have risen by 6%, or about £7bn, in the year to October compared with the same period in 2020, in a recovery from the worst economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. However, they remain 13%, or about £18bn, down on the same periods in 2019 and 2018. . The aggregate figures obscure how certain sectors have suffered dramatic shortfalls, in what could mark permanent structural changes. Outbound shipments of clothing and footwear to the EU are both down by about 60% compared with 2019. Meat exports have plunged by almost 25%, vegetables and fruit are down by an even steeper 40%. Fishing, held up by Brexiters as a sector that would benefit from being unshackled from EU rules, is now nursing a 15% fall in exports. The unravelling of British textile exports could be down to “rule of origin” requirements, which require a proportion of a product to be domestically produced to benefit from a trade deal. This is because a high proportion of clothing sold by UK retailers is made in Asia or the US, making them ineligible for the tariffs negotiated in the post-Brexit trade deal. Michael Gasiorek, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex, said: “In textiles and clothing it is almost certainly associated with rules of origin and having to pay tariffs on exports to the EU; in food products it is probably to do with customs controls and the costs of checks on standards, and possibly from transport and logistic complications.” Fish and meat exporters say they have been hit by higher costs for sending lorry shipments through ports, with an army of extra workers required to deal with additional bureaucracy and paperwork. Figures from the ONS show more than a quarter of firms currently trading in the UK have seen a rise in their costs. Other data shows UK exporters have been losing market share. Work by the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis on trade by advanced economies shows goods exports for the month of September were just 1.3% below the monthly average in 2018, after adjusting for inflation. In the UK, however, real exports were almost 15% down in the same month. Few expect the free trade deals struck by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and her successor as trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, will make up for the drop in business – the EU is the UK’s nearest and biggest market, and still accounts for almost half of trade. Official government figures estimate the free trade deals signed so far – including those with Australia, New Zealand, and Japan – will add less than 1% to UK GDP over 15 years. A trade deal with the US would produce the same as these small deals combined, experts say, still not enough to make up the EU shortfall. “It’s crazy what they’ve done,” said Angus MacNeil, the SNP chair of the Commons international trade committee. “I compare it to saying we need six or seven planets populated entirely by Americans to make up for Brexit.” For Trunki, sales in Britain are back to pre-pandemic levels as families bought more wheelie suitcases and bags in anticipation of going on holiday, but EU sales are still at 80% of 2019 levels. Law plans to open a German distribution hub to sidestep delays and red tape for shipments sent directly to customers from the firm’s Plymouth factory, after an earlier plan to set up a base in the Netherlands started to unravel. He is optimistic that despite the challenges he will keep trading, even with the extra barriers. “It can’t be as bad as this year, it can’t be as bad as January with not being able to get things out of the country. It can’t be,” he said. Exports to the EU also ground to a halt in January for North Shields-based recycling firm ECS Textiles, stymied by border checks and paperwork for the assorted items of clothing, toys and bric-a-brac it would send to Latvia by sea each week. The firm has since given up on selling to the EU, having found a buyer in Russia and Belarus instead. “The [Brexit] deal was obviously done very last-minute, and it was very slapdash,” said James Officer, sales manager at the firm. While some might say expanding horizons outside of the EU is part of the point of Brexit, Officer disagrees. Selling to Russia and Belarus isn’t as profitable, and the countries he now does business with carry significantly more risk. As Belarus descended into political turmoil, and the UK introduced financial sanctions to punish the Lukashenko regime, ECS almost went bust after its bank account was frozen for nine weeks because it was receiving payments from the country. The local Labour MP, Alan Campbell, stepped in and helped resolve the situation. “You’re out of the frying pan with Europe and into more hot water in Belarus. Brexit absolutely was not a good thing for our business. I haven’t seen any benefit,” Officer said. Britain’s chaotic year for trade is not all down to Brexit. Major economies the world over have faced Covid disruption – with lockdowns in China and the worst backlogs on record in southern California – caused by pandemic restrictions, shortages of lorry drivers and mismatches in supply and demand. In the UK, car exports are down 30% on 2019 levels, held back in large part by shortages of microchips around the world. Chemical exports, on the other hand, have performed more strongly than anticipated, up 5% on 2019 levels, despite warnings the sector stood to be among the biggest losers from Brexit. Chemicals have been in part protected because regulations covering the industry remain in line with EU rules – for the time being. While economists say it is difficult to disentangle the effects of Covid and Brexit, many business leaders argue leaving the EU has made a bad situation worse. There is concern over a further worsening of relations with France, and if negotiations over the Northern Ireland protocol end in stalemate. Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “A renewed trade spat likely would ensure that global manufacturers remain reluctant to locate production facilities in Britain, thereby undermining exports in the medium term.” He cautioned that the competitiveness of UK goods could start to decline “indefinitely” as tougher migration rules push up labour costs and a departure from EU safety standards restricts where products can be sold. The £1tn export target is likely to be about 67% higher than total trade volumes this year. It might not be reached at all. On current form, said Tombs, the target “looks like another Brexit fantasy”.",News/Politics,‘Perfect storm’: a look back at a tumultuous year of Brexit and Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/28/a-look-back-at-a-tumultuous-year-for-uk-trade
12/28/2021,"Workers at the American Red Cross charity are speaking out about what they say is low pay, chronic understaffing, poor working conditions throughout the pandemic and proposed cuts to their healthcare.  “The morale is at an all time low in my 23 years of history here,” said Darryl Ford, a collection technician at American Red Cross in Warner Robins, Georgia, and president of local union branch USW L254. He described Red Cross’ response to the pandemic as business as usual, as the non-profit ramped up blood drives anywhere they were able to hold them, since many typical blood drive sites closed when the pandemic hit. Ford also criticized the American Red Cross for doing little to nothing to clarify to the public that the blood donation drives were just testing for Covid-19 antibodies, not performing Covid-19 testing and providing inadequate PPE to workers. Due to the low pay, scheduling problems and working conditions, Ford noted that American Red Cross in his region experienced workers leaving throughout the pandemic. “People are quitting,” added Ford. “It’s a slap in the face to the employees for management to say ‘we’re going to cut your healthcare and not pay you anything, while we’re going to work from home and be safe.’” The Coalition of American Red Cross Unions, which represents about 4,900 workers from 11 international unions at American Red Cross across the US, is bargaining with the American Red Cross over the national addendum to the unions’ contracts, which expires on 31 March 2022. The unions are pushing for wage increases, to preserve existing healthcare plans and for solutions to address chronic staffing shortages around the US. The American Red Cross reported a revenue of more than $2.8bn in the 2020 fiscal year and the CEO of the non-profit received a salary of more than $700,000. The majority of its revenue, approximately $1.73bn, went toward biomedical services, the part of the organization that collects blood donations and sells them to hospitals and healthcare providers. The American Red Cross provides about 40% of the nation’s blood supply. Workers who collect and manage blood donations for the non-profit continued working throughout the Covid-19 pandemic as essential workers. Alexis Zebrowski, a member of CWA Local 1118, worked as an aide specialist at the branch in Albany, New York for one year before quitting in November 2021 over the low pay around minimum wage, understaffing and working conditions through the pandemic. As an aide specialist, she collected platelet, plasma and blood donations, conducted medical physicals of donors and took patient histories and helped run blood donation drives, which she noted were consistently understaffed and resulted in work shifts that went at least one hour or longer past her scheduled ten-hour shift without being able to take breaks. “I can go work at any fast food restaurant and make more money,” said Zebrowski. “I was sick of the pay and all the constant bargaining and everything. The contracts still keep getting pushed out because they don’t want to give us a raise or even acknowledge anything we do for the company. It’s a slap in the face to work for the amount of money we are working for.” She said the low pay and forced overtime led to worsening understaffing through the pandemic, with management rushing new hires through training and blaming existing staff when errors were made as a result. “When we’re working, we’re expected to work at 100%, but we never have 100% in return,” added Zebrowski. “We’re always forced to come into work no matter what, sick or not, we were expected to be there. Otherwise, we’d be fearing for our job because we’d be too worried about being written up for attendance.” Bobbie Terrell, a collections technician and member of AFSCME Council 31 at a branch in Peoria, Illinois, criticized American Red Cross for responding to chronic staffing shortages in her area by offering $1,500 sign on bonuses for new hires and paying them higher wages, while the only appreciation or benefit that longtime employees have received is pizza. “The people they’ve hired since November are significantly making more money than the staff who have been here for years,” said Terrell. “That’s a major slap in the face to the current staff that have worked through this whole pandemic and not been offered anything but pizza.” She also expressed frustration with American Red Cross’s proposal to cut the employees’ health insurance benefits, saying she is concerned that cutting healthcare will worsen staffing problems. She also criticized the organization for not paying workers to quarantine after being exposed to donors or coworkers who test positive for Covid-19. “Staff are being sent home for 10 to 14 days at a time, unpaid,” added Terrell. “We’re on the frontlines doing the job for them of collecting these life-saving products and basically they’re telling us that it’s at our own risk.” A spokesperson for American Red Cross claimed the non-profit plans to offer wage increases and retention bonuses to existing employees. But the spokesperson added that the group has not yet reached an agreement with unions on the terms and how the raises will be implemented, in addition to ongoing negotiations over healthcare. They noted employees were provided with pay to quarantine in Spring 2020 and from 21 November 2020 to 2 April 2021. “Across the country, many employers are facing staffing shortages as a result of pandemic employment trends and vaccination requirements, which have exacerbated the challenges to recruit and retain staff,” said the spokesperson. “Over the past few months, the Red Cross actively recruited to fill vacancies on our biomedical services teams and have made significant investments in additional resources and tools to seek out and attract candidates, including new hire bonuses.” The spokesperson added: “Our intention is to reach a fair and amicable agreement with the Coalition of Red Cross Unions and all of our local unions.”",News/Society,‘Slap in the face’: American Red Cross workers describe exploitative work conditions,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/28/american-red-cross-workers-describe-exploitative-conditions
12/28/2021,"Joe Root insisted he will wait until the end of the Ashes tour to discuss his future as Test captain and called on English cricket to “reset” its approach to the red-ball format after Australia claimed a series victory in the space of 12 days. In the aftermath of England’s innings defeat in Melbourne, an unassailable 3-0 scoreline sealed by an embarrassing collapse to 68 all out on the third morning, Root was asked whether he wanted to continue in a role that has brought an English record 27 Test wins and yet seven defeats from eight in Australia.  “The series isn’t over yet. We’ve got two very big games and, more than anything, it’d be wrong to look past that,” replied Root, who was among the victims as debutant Scott Boland managed remarkable bowling figures of six for seven from four overs. “I’m in the middle of a very important series. My energy has to be all about trying to win the next game. I can’t be selfish and start thinking about myself. I think more than anything you’ve got to keep looking to do everything we can to get the players in the best possible place to go and win Test matches.” Root had earlier been removed for 28 during 80 minutes of carnage, meaning his own personal annus mirabilis with the bat fell 80 runs short of breaking Mohammad Yousuf’s Test record of 1,788 in a calendar year. Ultimately others have fallen short here, with Rory Burns, dropped in Melbourne, the next best with 530 runs in 2021. On the third morning they also registered their 54th duck of 2021, equalling a record set in 1998. This was also England’s ninth defeat since the start of January, equalling another record for a calendar year. After 2016 saw eight Test losses, the year ended with a jaded Alastair Cook stepping down from the captaincy. It may be that the decision is taken out of Root’s hands, with both he and the head coach, Chris Silverwood, set to see their positions reviewed by Ashley Giles when the director of men’s cricket arrives in Australia next week before the fourth Test. The problems appear to go beyond captain and coach, however, with this latest Ashes trouncing furthering calls for English cricket to re-evaluate its approach to the first-class game. Root hopes a reboot occurs, similar to the one that followed England’s harrowing 2015 World Cup campaign and then saw Eoin Morgan lift the trophy four years later. Root said: “It’s a big part of where the game is at in our country right now that the only place you can really learn [to play Test cricket] is in the hardest environment for what is quite a young batting group. “They’re having to learn out here in the harshest environments. You look back at 2015 and the reset that happened in white-ball cricket, and maybe that’s something that needs to be happening in our red-ball game as well.” In the short term the England team are dealing with a Covid-19 outbreak among the near 60-strong touring party that has seen three coaches and three family members test positive for the virus and forced to isolate and could yet threaten the completion of a tour that, after Sydney, concludes with a day-night Test in Hobart. Both sets of players were cleared by emergency PCR tests before the third day was allowed to commence at the MCG, with additional testing to take place over the coming days. For Australia the series win caps a rewarding couple of months that began with a surprise victory at the T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. However their captain, Pat Cummins, declined to be drawn on the future of the head coach Justin Langer, whose position has been the subject of much debate over the past 12 months. Cummins, who replaced Tim Paine before the start of the series, said: “I think we’ll savour this victory today and continue the Ashes. I don’t think today is the day to speculate on [Langer’s future]. We’ll all sit down together after this series. His contract is up for renewal in a few months and we’ll deal with that then.” On his side’s Ashes campaign to date, Cummins added: “It doesn’t just feel like a three-nil victory, it really feels like we’re setting ourselves up for the next few years as well. We’ve got seven players in the top 10 of the world at the moment – four batters [Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, David Warner and Travis Head] and three bowlers [Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc]. “We probably haven’t strung the performances over the last couple of years that we probably expected of ourselves. So I think this really consolidates that we are a really good, strong Test cricket side and it’s a good sign for the next few years.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root wants post-Ashes England ‘reset’ but puts off captaincy discussion,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/28/joe-root-wants-post-ashes-england-reset-but-puts-off-captaincy-discussion-australia-cricket
12/28/2021,"A review into crossbow ownership has been ordered by the home secretary just days after a 19-year-old man was arrested at Windsor Castle on Christmas Day allegedly carrying the weapon. The Metropolitan police are investigating a video, which has been linked to the suspect, which appears to show a masked figureholding a crossbow and saying they want to “assassinate the Queen”.  A Home Office spokesperson said the department had been instructed by Priti Patel to look at possible ways to “strengthen controls” on the weapons. The spokesperson said: “Crossbows are subject to controls, and legislation is in place to deal with those who use them as a weapon. “At the home secretary’s request, we are considering options to strengthen controls on crossbows. Work on this has been ongoing throughout the year, and we keep all relevant laws under review to maintain public safety.” The man arrested on Christmas Day within the grounds of the castle in Berkshire where the Queen is in residence has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, the Metropolitan police said. According to the Daily Telegraph, Whitehall sources said officials had been instructed to “incorporate any lessons” from the arrest into a review of crossbow laws which was ordered earlier this year. Under current legislation, it is an offence for anyone under 18 to buy or possess a crossbow and for anyone to sell a crossbow to someone aged under 18. Crossbows may also be considered offensive weapons and are prohibited from being carried in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Demands for tighter regulation of crossbows initially came after the five-day inquest into the death of Shane Gilmer in April. The 30-year-old died after his neighbour, Anthony Lawrence, broke into his house in January 2018 and shot him and his partner, Laura Sugden, who survived the attack. The coroner, Prof Paul Marks, submitted a report to Patel in May in which he said he was concerned there was “no ongoing control, record or licensing requirement for (crossbows)”, unlike firearms. On Monday the father of the 19-year-old arrested on Christmas Day reportedly told MailOnline: “Something’s gone horribly wrong with our son and we are trying to figure out what.” “We’ve not had a chance to speak to him but are trying to get him the help he needs,” he said. “From our perspective, we are going through a difficult time. We are trying to resolve this issue and it’s not easy.”",News/UK news,Priti Patel orders review of crossbow laws after Windsor Castle incident,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/priti-patel-orders-review-of-crossbow-laws-after-windsor-castle-incident
