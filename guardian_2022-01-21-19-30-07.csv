1/21/2022,"The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said allegations of blackmailing by government whips against Tory rebels need to be investigated but are unlikely to be true. Speaking to Sky News, Kwarteng said: “Any form of blackmail and intimidation of that kind simply has no place in British politics.” He added: “We need to get to the bottom of the matter. I’d find it very unlikely that these allegations are true.”  On Thursday, William Wragg, the chair of the public administration committee, claimed there had been attempted blackmail involving threats to funding in the constituencies of his fellow Conservative MPs who backed a confidence vote in Boris Johnson’s leadership. No 10 dismissed the allegations and said they would only be investigated if any evidence was presented. Although Kwarteng was sceptical of the allegations, he suggested they should be investigated. He said: “I find it strange because the whip’s office doesn’t actually have the power over spending in that way. But obviously, we’re going to take the allegation seriously and we need to look [get] to the bottom of it.” He added: “I’ve been an MP for 12 years now and I’ve never heard of the kind of allegations that have been made – blackmail, the idea that somehow money is being withheld from communities that need it on account of the behaviour of the MPs, I’ve never heard of anything like that.” “It’s really important that whips get on with MPs – it’s a really important relationship. So I was very surprised to see the allegations. I haven’t seen any evidence to back them up. But obviously we have to look and see what’s actually gone on. “I don’t want to get drawn into what will happen if unsubstantiated allegations [are] proven true. All I would like to say is that it’s completely unacceptable. And we need to get to the bottom of the matter.” Christian Wakeford, the former Tory MP who defected to Labour on Wednesday, said the whips had threatened to withhold money for a school in his Bury South constituency when he was considering rebelling against the government. Kwarteng told Sky: “He’s a Labour MP now, and of course, part of his job is to try and discredit the government.” Asked later by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about Wakeford’s allegation, Kwarteng said: “I’m sure it will be investigated if it’s not being so already … I think Christian Wakeford will be aware that the whips don’t have authority to spend money in local communities. I don’t think it is true.” He added: “I think the claims have been unsubstantiated, as the prime minister said, he hadn’t seen any evidence. I haven’t seen any evidence of this. Any allegation of that seriousness should be looked into and would have consequences if it is found to be true.” The claims over whipping tactics came as Johnson battled to remain in power before the outcome of an inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray into allegations of rule-breaking partying at Downing Street during coronavirus restrictions. The Times reported that rebels were considering releasing texts or recordings of their conversations with whips to show their tactics.",News/Politics,"Blackmail allegations need to be investigated, says Kwasi Kwarteng",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/21/blackmail-allegations-need-to-be-investigated-says-kwasi-kwarteng
1/21/2022,"It’s deeply ironic that lubricant has such a dry reputation among many folks. Sadly, scores of people are labouring under the misapprehension that a tube of lube is a product you only reluctantly reach for when there’s some kind of uncomfortable problem with your love life. In fact, while it can certainly help solve and soothe a vast plethora of bedroom-based issues, as we’ll explore, lubricant has huge potential to be fun as well as functional. A water-based formula such as Kynect – the new name for KY Jelly – is the Swiss army knife of the sex world: indispensable for all sorts of adventures and activities. It’s the one simple “must have” I’d recommend to pretty much any human who wants to enhance their erotic pleasure, whether partnered or solo, and I want to normalise its usage without shame, embarrassment or restraint – consensual bondage excepted.  Here’s a roundup of reasons why cracking out the lube can lead to a more cracking sexual experience … Lubricant helps condoms work more safely, and feel more sensualA little lube applied to the outside of a condom once it’s on reduces friction, which in turn reduces the chances of your rubber ripping or accidentally being tugged off during intercourse. Pop a small drop inside the tip of the condom before you roll it on (a practice known as “gift wrapping”), and it’ll feel better for the wearer, too – just a touch is enough to increase sensitivity around the head of the penis without affecting grip at the base, so your protection stays in place. Oil-based products such as moisturising lotions, petroleum jelly, baby oil, coconut oil and massage oil can all degrade latex, making natural rubber condoms more likely to break. Different oils interact with the material in different ways, depending upon their molecular structure, and thus have more or less capacity to cause damage, but the golden rule is that if you’re relying upon condoms to provide a barrier between you and STI risk and/or unplanned pregnancy, anything oily shouldn’t be touched with a bargepole, and your bargepole shouldn’t touch anything oily. If massage features as part of your foreplay, switch to using a water-based gel such as Kynect rather than an oil to help your hands glide smoothly and safely, and make skin glisten and gleam seductively. As a bonus, lube is easier to wash out of your sheets post-playtime: all gain, no stain. Plus, if you’re prone to yeast infections, use of oils in and around the vagina is associated with higher rates of candida colonisation – the fungus responsible for thrush – so switching could help you avoid itching. Fancy a new smooth move? Draw inspiration from the Japanese “nuru” massage technique, in which both partners’ bodies are glossed with lube, and they slip-slide their whole selves against one another. It enhances sensation during masturbationUsing lube during a ménage a moi can also help men avoid “death grip syndrome”: coined by renowned American sex columnist Dan Savage, this phrase describes a situation whereby a penis owner becomes conditioned via long-term rough, harsh manual masturbation habits to only orgasm in response to similarly aggressive forms of stimulation, meaning that the comparatively soft, gentle feelings of a vagina or tongue aren’t strong enough to induce climax. He may even struggle to maintain an erection during coupled play. The complication is thought to particularly affect circumcised men, who tend to have reduced genital sensitivity as their glans is always exposed rather than being covered with a foreskin, making them more likely to develop intense masturbatory practices. Using lube with a looser stroke when alone can help foster a more satisfying response to lighter stimulation. It combats vaginal dryness … which is much more common than you thinkThe hormone oestrogen is responsible for ensuring that the walls of the vagina stay plump, elastic, and moisturised with a clear lubricating fluid – so when oestrogen levels dip every month at certain points in the menstrual cycle, or on a permanent basis after menopause, it’s utterly normal to feel dehydrated downstairs. Hormone levels also change during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and dryness can additionally be caused by underlying conditions such as diabetes; reactions to perfumed soaps and shower gels; alcohol; stress; treatments such as chemotherapy; and all manner of medications, including contraceptive pills. Certain antidepressants that give you a hand handling the blues can unfortunately make your pink bits arid, while antihistamines that stop your eyes and nose running can also halt fluid production in more southerly mucous membranes. Given all these factors, it’s no wonder that many women have experienced dryness causing discomfort during sex. Use lube. Make things wetter. Make things better. Simple. It helps when your mind’s turned on, but your body hasn’t caught up yetOn occasion, dryness can be a sign that you’re not in a sexy mood; that what’s happening isn’t tickling your pickle; or that you need more foreplay before things move forward. However, that’s not always the case. Sometimes you can be dying to treat yourself to a quickie before the kids wake from their nap (or the teens get back before curfew), yet your body can’t work to make moisture at 100 miles per hour. Or maybe you begin feeling fabulous in your head, but then when your bits don’t immediately cooperate in bed, worrying about feeling dry starts to dampen your mood (there’s that irony again!) … which makes it even harder to get wet. Your partner notices things aren’t going smoothly; it puts them off their stride too; and the whole fumble starts tumbling down. Lubricant can break this vicious circle in a dash. It’s vital for anal playThe bottom line? Lube is essential for any voyage up the back passage, as unlike the vagina, the anus doesn’t produce its own natural moisture at all. Plugs, probes, prostate toys, or penetration by a person: whatever you’re introducing to your rear end, using lashings of lube and warming up slowly are the best ingredients to feel fantastic and avoid injuries such as tears or fissures. It plays perfectly with sex toysAdding lube can bring a whole new dimension of sensation to a favourite vibrator or stimulator. Some silicone-based lubricants don’t react well with certain silicone toys, though, and can cause them to “rot” or “peel”. A plain water-based formula is gentle on the genitals and on toys too. It stops chafing during long sex sessionsIf you’ve got a dirty weekend planned, lube can help prevent you from walking like a rodeo bull-riding cowboy come Monday morning. And on a more everyday level, if you’re someone who requires a prolonged period of stimulation in order to orgasm, but finds themselves getting sore before they manage to get off, lube can take away the “ow” before the “O”. It makes cervical smears less stressfulAlong with tips like asking for a smaller speculum and to insert it yourself, bringing your own water-based lube can make cervical screening a less anxiety-inducing process for those who find this important health check triggering, painful or nerve-racking. For more support, I recommend the Vulval Pain Society’s Smears without Tears guide, and the My Body Back project for survivors of sexual abuse and assault. It helps bodies fit together betterIf you’re trying to put a girthy/long peg in a small/tight hole, lube equals less frustration, easier tessellation.

1/21/2022,"The owner of restaurant chains including Wagamama and Frankie & Benny’s said it expected full-year profits to hit the top end of its forecast despite a dramatic slowdown in sales last month because of the impact of the spread of the Omicron variant. The Restaurant Group (TRG), which owns 650 restaurants and pubs and operates 70 concessions mostly in airports, expects adjusted profits for 2021 to be at the top end of its £73m to £79m guidance to investors. It welcomed the government’s decision to lift plan B restrictions but warned that consumer confidence might take longer to recover.  The company said its performance had been achieved through good cost control and strong trading, with sales at its Wagamama chain up 11% in October and 8% in November compared with pre-pandemic levels. However, TRG, which owns brands including Garfunkel’s, the Tex-Mex chain Chiquito, Brunning & Price and Coast to Coast, said that sales slowed to only 1% growth in December as Omicron hit. TRG’s concessions business reported revenue declines of 34%, 24% and 34% in the final three months of last year compared with 2019. “The introduction of the UK government’s plan B in early December, which included advice to work from home, calls for further caution in socialising and increased testing requirements for international travel, reduced consumer confidence and put additional restrictions on the hospitality sector,” the company said. “[However], TRG continued to trade ahead of the market demonstrating our ability to outperform in all market conditions.” The company expects a sustained recovery to be some way off, though, as consumers continue to go out less and international travel lags pre-pandemic levels. “While we are encouraged with the recent government announcement that all plan B restrictions will be lifted next week, we expect consumer confidence may take longer to recover,” it said. “We are also mindful that the recovery in air passenger volumes remains dependent on the timing of changes to both UK and international restrictions.” TRG also expects to better its net debt forecast of about £190m and end the year at less than £180m. “Management reacted quickly to reduce food and staff costs, which allowed it to protect margins through December,” said James Ainley, an analyst at Citi. “In addition, capex projects were shelved or delayed, which has also supported a better than expected net debt performance.”",News/Business,Wagamama owner TRG expects to rise above the Omicron effect,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/21/wagamama-owner-trg-expects-to-rise-above-the-omicron-effect
1/21/2022,"Women and girls whose grandfathers or great-grandfathers began smoking at an early age tend to have more body fat, research that taps into the extraordinary 30-year-old Children of the 90s study has found. In an earlier piece of work it was discovered that if a father started smoking regularly before reaching puberty, then his sons, but not daughters, had more body fat than expected.  Now researchers believe they have pinpointed higher body fat in females with grandfathers or great-grandfathers who began smoking before the age 13. No effects were observed in male descendants. The research suggests exposure to substances can lead to changes that may be passed through the generations, though the team behind the research concede that much more work is needed to confirm this and understand how it may happen. They have been able to spot the possible link because of the detail and depth of inter-generational data the University of Bristol study provides and it is an example of findings that the scientists could not have anticipated when it was launched in 1991. Prof Jean Golding, the founder of Children of the 90s and lead author of the latest report, praised the participants in the study – an original cohort of 14,000 pregnant women who agreed to take part plus, now, their children and grandchildren. Other pieces of research over the decades that could not have been foreseen include the finding 20 years ago that women who eat oily fish during pregnancy, even only once every two weeks, have children with sharper eyesight. This was believed to be the first time diet in pregnancy was shown to be associated with a child’s visual development. A study published in 2013 concluded that iodine deficiency in pregnancy could have an adverse effect on children’s mental development. The discovery was made possible because the study had urine samples from early in participants’ pregnancies and detailed records of what the expectant mothers were eating. Yet another finding was that early signs of a genetic liability to Type 2 diabetes could be spotted in children as young as eight and a link was also made between peanut allergies and skin cream containing peanut oil. The Children of the 90s project has even allowed experts to examine how wounds heal by looking at participants’ BCG vaccine scars. For the latest study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers dug into data on the smoking experiences of grandfathers and great-grandfathers. They could not look into the smoking of grandmothers and great-grandmothers as so few smoked, but were confident they would have reasonably reliable data from the male side of the family because they were likely to boast about smoking at a very young age. Golding said: “This research provides us with two important results. First, that before puberty, exposure of a boy to particular substances might have an effect on generations that follow him. Second, one of the reasons why children become overweight may be not so much to do with their current diet and exercise, rather than the lifestyle of their ancestors or the persistence of associated factors over the years.” Golding said animal experiments had shown that exposure of males to certain chemicals before breeding can have effects on their offspring but there has been doubt as to whether this phenomena is present in humans. “If these associations are confirmed in other datasets, this will be one of the first human studies with data suitable to start to look at these associations and to begin to unpick the origin of potentially important cross-generation relationships. There is a heck of a lot more to discover,” Golding said.",News/Society,Pioneering study finds generational link between smoking and body fat,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/children-of-the-90s-smoking-body-fat
1/21/2022,"Scott Morrison has taken aim at China for “economic coercion”, foreign interference and cyber attacks in a speech to the Davos World Economic Forum. Without naming the source of “sharper geopolitical competition”, the Australian prime minister warned of increasing territorial disputes in the Indo-Pacific region and urged an end to protectionist measures directed at Australia.  Australia has been the target of Chinese tariffs on key agricultural exports, such as barley and wheat, due to a long series of grievances including “interference in China’s Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs” and “spearheading the crusade against China in certain multilateral forums”. Morrison told the forum that the global strategic environment had “deteriorated” with the world becoming more “fragmented and contested particularly here in the Indo-Pacific, which has become the world’s strategic centre of gravity”. Morrison said the region had become “highly contested” due to increased use of “grey-zone tactics” seeking to “coerce and intimidate”. “There are tensions over territorial claims, there is rapid military modernisation, there is foreign interference occurring in nations right across the Pacific and here in Australia. “There’s malicious cyber threats and attacks that are taking place, disinformation, economic coercion.” In response, Morrison said Australia had sought a “web of alignment” with nations that wanted to cooperate to “favour freedom and the rule of law”, including Pacific nations, Asean and the Quad group with Japan, India and the US. “Australia’s interests are inextricably linked to an open inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific, one where the rights of all nations are protected … as well as aspirations as sovereign nations.” Morrison argued that Australia had sought to “hold firm to its values” despite experiencing economic protectionist and coercive measures that were “not without costs”. “But I also believe it’s come at a significant cost to the countries which implement such measures – it’s hard to see how anyone wins from such tactics. “The world can’t afford to march in that direction.” Morrison also noted increased tension with Russia over Ukraine and between the G2 of US and China. “The idea that we would be in a hemisphere of influence with one power in the region, is not something that is consistent with global stability and regional stability.” Australia has sought to fight off Chinese tariffs at the World Trade Organization, while some National party members in the ruling Coalition suggesting countering with protectionist measures. The US has vowed to help Australia resist Chinese protectionism. Morrison also used the Davos speech to boast of Australia’s economic recovery from the pandemic, with unemployment down to 4.2%, and its health outcomes, with the second-lowest death rate in the OECD from Covid and eighth-highest vaccination rate. Morrison said there had been no “great resignation” in Australia, crediting its success to a “business-led recovery” and not pursuing “funky experiments” with a permanently enlarged role for government in the economy. On climate, Morrison said Australia had cut its emissions by 20% on 2005 levels and now aims to achieve net zero by 2050. But when asked if Australia would sign up to the ICAO protocol for net zero emissions in the aviation sector, Morrison dead-batted by saying Australia “doesn’t make commitments without fully considering what the impacts are”.",News/Australia news,Morrison speaks out against China’s ‘economic coercion’ at Davos,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/21/morrison-speaks-out-against-chinas-economic-coercion-at-davos

1/21/2022,"“We’re like Batman and Robin – obviously, I’m Batman.” Andi Oliver, 58, is with her daughter, Miquita, 37, bunkering down in a coastal cottage in Hastings for a while to recuperate after a busy 12 months of working together. “We just want to sleep for a bit,” groans Miquita. But between bickering over which houses are the best to peek into on walks back home in east London, bursting into unstoppable deep belly laughs every five minutes, and occasionally pausing our conversation to answer the calls of other family members, it becomes clear that a restful time isn’t something the Oliver women experience much of. Both have successful television careers in their own rights (TV chef Andi is now a regular on weekend cooking shows; Miquita is best known for hosting 00s hit teen-show Popworld) but, in recent years, mother and daughter have merged their professional paths. It started with a BBC roadtrip show in 2018, Eight Go Rallying: The Road to Saigon, which saw them drive 3,000km around south-east Asia in a Morris Minor. They gained a deeper understanding of each other, and got a flair for working together, so when the pandemic hit, the pair formed a bubble and started an irresistibly upbeat Instagram series, What’s for Dinner Mummy?, documenting the joy of cooking. They also charmed viewers on Celebrity Gogglebox. Separately they are great – but united, they have an endorphin-pumping energy that can force a toothy smile out of anyone.  Their next project is BBC Two’s culture series The Caribbean With Andi and Miquita, which airs on Sunday. “My parents grew up on different ends of the same street in St John’s in Antigua,” recalls Andi, “but they didn’t actually meet until they moved here and went to a dance in Leicester.” It’s this sort of tale that has always piqued her curiosity about her heritage, but it’s taken a while for her daughter to catch up. “Mum treated me to a trip to Antigua for my 11th birthday, but I didn’t want to go if I’m honest; I was young, settled at school and probably in love with a boy I didn’t want to leave behind,” giggles Miquita, fully aware of how brattish it sounds now. “She was a moody teenager!” Andi quickly interrupts. “She didn’t get the personal, familial, gut-wrenching ‘connection’ that I wanted her to have.” The new show was the pair’s second shot at it; they had been trying to get it commissioned for nearly five years. “This kind of story has always been really important to us – and the world – it just wasn’t given a platform,” says Miquita. “But the Black Lives Matter movement blowing up – it gave us the opportunity to tell what we’d wanted to for a long time.” Not only did the duo finally get the chance to showcase their story, they were able to do it as more than just the stars of the show they pitched – they are also producers. “It’s a big deal for us,” says Andi, of roles that saw her and Miquita work closely with the director, and get their teeth stuck into the editing. “We realised a dream to be more than presenters after broadcasting for so many years.” The pair also hope their adventure will help to change people’s perceptions of their destination: “In the UK, there’s a sort of homogenised idea of the Caribbean,” says Miquita. “It becomes one island, usually Jamaica. To the point where I – a woman of Caribbean descent – didn’t even really know much about the other islands.” This is rectified as the intrepid travellers explore the Caribbean island by island (Antigua, Barbuda, Barbados), meeting islanders to get a real sense of local life and – most importantly – learning the different ways they let their hair down. “In Barbados, you have a beer with your food at 8am on a Saturday morning and basically go on a pub crawl,” says Andi (in stitches of laughter). “This lovely man called Brian took us out and he said it’s all a respected part of culture,” chirps Miquita (also chuckling away). “In Barbados they don’t drink with guilt or shame. I was talking to my friends about this the other day – I learned a lot about that – eradicating the shame that comes with having a drink in the UK and just having fun.” Food and drink was always going to be a big – and very welcome – part of the show with Andi involved (she opened Wadadli, a Caribbean food pop-up, in her local pub in Clapton, east London, during the pandemic). In fact, she says she is infuriated by how misunderstood Caribbean food is in the UK. “People often call it Jamaican food, which drives me up the wall. Every island has its own version of Caribbean food. People have travelled through the Caribbean islands for all sorts of reasons and left their imprint in the DNA and the food. There’s a dish in Antigua called ‘vina dosh’ which is a really old way of cooking pork marinated in vinegar; in Portugal there’s a dish called ‘vinah d’alhos’ which is also pork marinated in vinegar; then in India there is a dish called ‘vindaloo’ …” “She loves telling that story,” Miquita rolls her eyes before cracking up again. Did they find a new connection to the islands? “Without giving too much away, we had DNA tests done and they were quite mind-blowing. Expect lots of ugly crying on the telly,” howls Andi. “We were there at a time of change: Barbados became a republic last year and is now run by two incredible women [president Sandra Mason and prime minister Mia Mottley],” adds Miquita. “It felt serendipitous being there.” While many women would balk at the thought of working so closely with their mother or daughter full-time – regardless of how well they get on – these two make it look easy. It would be enviable, if they weren’t so likable. “We did some crazy things together; we were terrified when we went deep-sea swimming! To be a mother and daughter on an adventure together and show what it’s really like: the truths of it, the ins and outs, the ups and downs … we’re really proud of that,” says Miquita, in a suddenly more serious tone. “My mum was a single parent until my stepdad came along. We’re used to being a team: Mum was 20 when she had me, so it was a baby looking after a baby. We’ve always looked after each other and this just feels like an extension from how it started.” “Aw, that’s lovely!” coos Andi. They pause for a millisecond – and then the laughter erupts once more.

1/21/2022,"One day, during the first Covid lockdown, Caleb Azumah Nelson’s father offered to cut his hair. “He’s not great with his words, but that’s a very specific way of saying: ‘Can I care for you?’” explains the 28-year-old writer and photographer, who spent the pandemic back in his family home in south-east London with his parents and his younger twin siblings. It’s just such moments that illuminate his debut novel, Open Water: tender, carefully observed and reported, casting a gentle light on the limitations of masculinity. A lot has happened since the book was published: he’s toured Germany, Austria and Switzerland; won the American accolade of a listing among the National Book Foundation’s “5 under 35” for exciting young writers; and this month he scooped his first big prize, the Costa first novel award, which brings with it the chance of being chosen as the overall book of the year, next month. He was standing in the street when the news came through: “I yelled with joy. It absolutely hadn’t been on my radar. I’ve been too busy trying to write the next one.”  At the heart of the novel is a love affair between a young couple – he a photographer, she a dancer – which repeatedly runs up against the man’s inability to process his anger about the injustice and violence he sees all around him. “When I was writing, I wasn’t conscious that I was trying to understand and sort through this idea of masculinity,” he says. “I was exploring two people who were trying to be as honest as they could with each other. And I think so often in love, men aren’t necessarily dishonest, but they don’t know how to express the whole truth.” Azumah Nelson wrote the book in 2019, after a grim two years in which he had suffered a rush of family bereavements. “I was beginning to feel very hazy. Like I’d lost some form, and some detail, in myself,” he says. He would go to the cinema, to art galleries, spend hours listening to music – “just trying to be as present as I could be”. And that, he says, “is where the writing started from”. At first it was “very lyrical essays that were a bit all over the place, to be perfectly honest”. He was working four days a week at the Apple store at Oxford Circus (hard on the feet but very handy for dialogue) and devoting the rest of his time to his photography and writing. “I was sending stuff around to literary agents, because, despite the fact that I was quite young, I really felt I had something to say.” He was reaching the bottom of his list when one agent finally bit, suggesting that fiction might be where his talents lay. Within a month he had submitted an early draft, which she batted back. So he scrapped it, quit his job, and by September had produced a novel. In the intensity of the relationship it depicts, Open Water has been compared with Sally Rooney’s Normal People when in fact it is nothing like it. For a large part of the novel, the unnamed characters aren’t even lovers; they share a bed as friends, exhausted after nights out on the town, getting to know each other. “I have nothing against Sally, because I enjoyed her books and loved the adaptation as well. But I think I favoured sensuality over sexuality,” he agrees. Besides a love story, Open Water packs into its 160 pages a passionate conversation with the artworks that have described and shaped young Black people like Azumah Nelson: the writing of James Baldwin and Zadie Smith, the paintings of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye and the music of the south London streets on which its author grew up. The son of Ghanaian parents, both of whom arrived in the UK as children, Azumah Nelson was a bookworm who, by 11, was petitioning his Catholic primary school to install a library because he was getting through novels faster than his midwife mother could buy them for him. Like both characters in the novel, he went to a private secondary school – in his case, winning a scholarship before becoming a star hockey player and reaching the under-16s national basketball squad. This relative privilege didn’t give him immunity from being stopped and searched by the police. “It happens really often: even as I was writing the book,” he says. Nor did it protect him from more insidious forms of institutional racism. The backstory of the novel is full of uncomfortable details from his narrator’s schooldays, such as being confused with other pupils who also happened to be Black. Was this his own experience? Yes, he says. There were four Black pupils in his year. He had great PE and English teachers, “but we were always made to feel grateful”. Running through Open Water is an exploration of where the freedom to fully and safely be oneself is to be found in a society riven with dangers for young Black men: it might be in a barbershop, a club or a loving relationship. “You would learn that love made you worry but it also made you beautiful,” reflects the narrator. “Love made you Black, as in, you were most coloured when in her presence.” His use of the second person is not a stylistic affectation but an outward expression of his narrator’s struggle to own his own feelings. Both his novel and short story, Pray, which first brought him to public attention with a shortlisting for the 2020 BBC short story prize, are shaped by acts of violence within the Black community. “I haven’t been directly connected to people who have passed, or have inflicted that violence, but you always know someone who has,” he says. “It’s never far away from you, and it’s something that has had a significant effect on me. There’s a lot of collective grief in these communities I’m part of.” Such acts, he says, “are moments in which we fail each other, and I don’t think that’s happened on its own. It’s directly influenced by state violence, whether that be the government making it harder for marginalised communities, or police stop-and-searching someone yet again, and that person not knowing where to put the anger and reaching for the person closest to them.” Fiction, like music and art, can help to give a manageable form and focus to those feelings, he believes – and responses to Open Water bear this out. “I’ve had quite a few messages from guys who have said I understood what it meant to not be able to express something.” Women, meanwhile, report being drawn in by his unusual depiction of love. “It’s such a surprise to see what resonates with people. It depends on where they are.

1/21/2022,"How should one feel about the first year of the Biden presidency? I can’t really say I’m disappointed, since I didn’t have high hopes going into it. But I do feel dread. This last year has felt a bit like being trapped in a nail-biting intermission between two horror films. The opening instalment consisted of Donald Trump’s first four years in office – it ended with the cliffhanger of a deadly plague and a surreal, poorly executed, but still terrifying ransacking of the Capitol. The sequel practically writes itself, as the man ascends to power a second time, even more emboldened and determined to hold on to power.  Of course, the script is not yet set in stone. If regular people in the US get organised, we can help push the political class toward a different ending. But to do this effectively, we need to tell a story that begins earlier. To continue with the bad movie metaphors, the prequels are what got us into this mess. For decades, senior Democrats tacked rightward, helping to create the social conditions that Trump and his cronies took advantage of to propel themselves to the White House. Instead of rolling back Reaganism and standing up to a swiftly radicalising conservative base, the party elite helped implement and further entrench an undemocratic, corporate agenda. Democratic functionaries slashed welfare, invested in the military and policing, deregulated the financial sector, increased fossil fuel production and lobbied for disastrous international trade deals. The people who did this are Biden’s natural milieu – and they want Americans to believe their problems began in 2016. Establishment Democrats are desperate to paint Donald Trump and the Covid-19 pandemic as aberrations to an otherwise agreeable status quo. Thus a speedy “return to normal” is all it will take to cure what ails us. The problem, however, is that “normal” was a crisis. The political scientist Corey Robin recently pointed out a core paradox of the Biden administration. On the one hand, Biden has some important accomplishments under his belt: two enormous spending bills and crucial federal appointments, including dozens of judges. But, as Robin notes, they are tainted by an awareness of their fundamental inadequacy. These perilous times require more than generous spending bills and staffing tweaks – Americans need to restructure the economy, stabilise the environment and democratise the political system, before it’s too late. Though never the progressive candidate, Biden briefly appeared to be willing to break with tradition and embrace a bolder approach. “When President Biden took office, he promised to make ending poverty a theory of change,” Shailly Barnes, policy director at the anti-poverty group, Poor People’s Campaign, told me. “While we saw glimmers of what that might have been, we have yet to see this implemented in practice. The 140 million people who are poor or one emergency away from economic ruin … need more than short-term or temporary assistance programmes.” Consider one area I know well: the fight for student debt cancellation. Short-term assistance is all these borrowers have received, despite Biden’s promise of mass relief. Student debt cancellation is an interesting litmus test for the administration. While other proposals he campaigned on – such as raising the minimum wage and securing voting rights – require legislation to pass, the president has the power to cancel all federal student loans with a single signature. But instead of picking up the pen, the president has balked and backtracked, misleadingly focusing on the few Ivy League graduates who would benefit from write-offs. At the end of last year, his administration publicly declared that turning student loan payments back on was a high priority for the administration. Why? A concern about optics: his advisers worry that further relief programmes would undercut messaging about the economy’s good health. Given this intransigence, activists like myself have had to fight the White House tooth and nail just to get it to extend the student loan payment pause to 1 May. Here, the folly of Biden’s first year is on full display. Student debt cancellation would be a win for the American people and the administration. The more loans are cancelled, the more the economy is boosted and the more the racial wealth gap narrows. It is also incredibly popular with young voters, Black voters, and even Republicans. Given that it is a midterm year, delivering on this promise should be a no-brainer. Reform of the criminal punishment system is another area where progress has stalled, despite Biden having come to power after a wave of historic racial justice protests. Members of the dominant, corporate wing of the Democratic party like to marginalise progressives and activists while presenting themselves as savvy and responsible realists. This strategy is both insulting and absurd: there’s nothing naive or irresponsible about wanting a decent and equitable society where people aren’t buried in unpayable debt and don’t have to live in fear of the police. But the strategy is also self-defeating. “They think they are pissing on the left, but what they are really doing is failing to fight visibly [and] vocally for millions of everyday working people,” rural Pennsylvania organiser and author Jonathan Smucker told me. “There is no world in which that is good politics.” The Biden administration has instead been engaged in a dispiriting saga of insider negotiations – negotiations that make an already restive public feel even more frustrated and abandoned. Where the build back better bill is concerned, the president should have instructed his allies in Congress to load it up with extra investment that would mollify opposition and make it harder for his party’s obstructionists, like Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, to hold it hostage. As the organiser Will Lawrence, a co-founder of the youth-led environmental justice-focused Sunrise Movement, put it on Twitter: include a “buyout of coal industry shareholders, and a generous lifetime pension for every miner in West Virginia. Blanket the airwaves promoting it for two weeks in West Virginia. Then put it to a vote and dare Manchin to vote against it.” If you are going to lose because a coal-baron senator is determined to derail your entire agenda and doom millions to deepening poverty and climate chaos, you may as well go down with a real fight. This fight should clarify for the public where the real problem is – not in culture war distractions, but the corruption of our political system by corporate interests – and it would make clear that the Democrats were firmly on their side. President Biden’s first year has ultimately demoralised people, while also providing an opportunity for Republicans to appear poised to seize power. Last spring, a strategic memo by Representative Jim Banks, leader of the largest bloc of House conservatives, was leaked: “URGENT: Cementing GOP as Working-Class party.” It laid out one plot for the second feature of the horror film I keep imagining. Of course, reactionaries will never actually defend working people. But they’re busy crafting a deceptive and destructive script. And if the current administration doesn’t act, we’ll all be watching it soon.

1/21/2022,"The Multiverse – or should that be Multiverses, as there are now Marvel and DC versions? – is clearly a good thing for superhero movies. Just as naysayers had begun to suggest comic book flicks might have exhausted all their vim and verve, along comes Spider-Man: No Way Home, a movie that uses the introduction of alternate realities to restore characters such as Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin and original wall-crawler Tobey Maguire with all the wide-eyed enthusiasm of a nine-year-old who’s just realised he can have He-Man and Jabba the Hutt battling a team comprising Snarf from the Thundercats and the Care Bears? The problem is, the internet has now worked out that if Maguire and Andrew Garfield can return to the big screen despite having never previously been in any Marvel superhero flicks, fans can really have anyone they want in future episodes. Dig deep enough and there are web rumours that the upcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness could feature the return of Robert Downey Jr as a version of Iron Man from another universe who did not die in the Infinity Wars. Not enough of an eye-popper for you? Some reports have even suggested that Tom Cruise could play a third version of Iron Man.  There is a danger here that we are getting into Snakes on a Plane territory, where fans end up almost writing the script for the film-makers. Andy Muschietti’s upcoming The Flash will see Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton return as alternative versions of Batman. And, let’s face it, there would hardly be gasps of shock if new kid Robert Pattinson turned up in Gotham at some point too. Thanks to the wonder of modern technology, DC could even re-enlist 1960s Batman Adam West if the late actor’s estate were up for it. It’s not like it hasn’t happened before. It even looks as if Hollywood’s A-list is beginning to get in on the act. This month’s GQ features Willem Dafoe pitching the tantalising prospect of himself and Joaquin Phoenix as duelling clown princes of Gotham in an-as-yet-to-be-but-let’s-face-it-probably-going-to-be-now future sequel to the Oscar-winning Joker. “There is something interesting about, like, if there was a Joker imposter,” Dafoe mulled. “So it would be possible to have not duelling Jokers but someone that [claims] to be the Joker that isn’t the Joker. “And that kind of opens up the possibility of an interesting story, particularly if you had Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker, and then you had someone who was either imitating or riffing off what he did. I fantasised about that. But other than that I am not talking to anybody [about it], you’re the first one.” But, in the current climate, it’s likely the GQ interviewer won’t be the last. And again, why not? We’re not entirely sure how Phoenix’s Joker really connects to the DC extended universe, where Jared Leto is still ostensibly Batman’s nemesis. In fact we’re not really sure if there is a DC universe any more, but there is certainly a Multiverse if The Flash is anything to go by. And that means everyone can have everything they’ve ever wanted right now, even if it means six different actors playing Batman in the same movie, like some gothic take on the spoof James Bond movie Casino Royale (1967 version) in which everyone from Peter Sellers to Woody Allen played versions of 007. Not buying that this fan-fulfilling version of reality is the one we now live in? Let me just point out that Disney+’s biggest current show is an entire series based on a minor character from Star Wars who barely had more than a few lines in George Lucas’s original trilogy. And, yes, I love it too, green-skinned, pig-face henchmen and all. So why shouldn’t Dafoe pitch his own Joker sequel? And why shouldn’t Iron Man be played by Cruise in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness? Except that eventually all this Multiverse-inspired stunt casting is going to become tired too, and DC and Marvel will have to think of something even more far fetched. Which, of course, we’ve all probably already worked out. First, we had superheroes who appeared in each other’s movies. Then we had superheroes from different studios appearing in each other’s movies. The next logical step is for a massive DC-Marvel crossover event in which Disney and Warner Bros triple their values overnight by sending Batman into battle against Spider-Man, and Wolverine up against Superman. In fact, let’s throw Luke Skywalker and Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible in for good measure. At this rate, Tom Cruise could actually end up fighting himself, and all in the name of good old-fashioned entertainment. It’s going to be like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen on steroids and LSD. I personally can’t wait.",Arts/Film,No way back!

1/21/2022,"After all those weekly showstopper challenges, it was perhaps inevitable: the TV phenomenon The Great British Bake Off is to become a stage musical. Billed as a heartwarming and wholesome comedy, the production will follow eight amateur bakers as they compete to impress the judges under the gaze of a pair of presenters. The musical will have its world premiere at the Everyman theatre in Cheltenham this summer. The score is by the award-winning duo Jake Brunger and Pippa Cleary whose previous musicals include an adaptation of Sue Townsend’s novel The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13¾.  The new musical’s producer, Mark Goucher, said that the TV competition – which first aired on BBC Two in 2010 and is now broadcast by Channel 4 – “gets to the heart of the nation”. An average of 6.9 million viewers watched the grand final of the 12th series, in November, in which 45-year-old Italian engineer Giuseppe Dell’Anno triumphed. Work on Great British Bake Off: The Musical began a couple of years ago in association with the executive producer of the TV series, Richard McKerrow, and the company behind the programme, Love Productions. McKerrow said the musical “has been a creative labour of love that has taken several years of painstaking development” and he hoped that it “embraces the soulful warmth and humorous spirit of the television show … We often say, ‘Love the bakers, love the baking!’ Now it’s time to love the singers, and love the songs!” The cast for the production, which opens on 22 July, is yet to be announced. The subject of baking has been a recipe for success in previous stage musicals including the Broadway and West End hit Waitress, set in a diner famed for its whimsically named dishes including Polka Dot Peach Pie, Couch Potato Pie and Lost Shepherd’s Pie. Stephen Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd – about the Victorian barber turned serial killer – has a less appetising menu. In one of its songs, the waltz A Little Priest, the baker Mrs Lovett promotes her “shepherd’s pie peppered with actual shepherd on top”.",Arts/Stage,Songs of glaze: Great British Bake Off musical to hit the stage this summer,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/21/great-british-bake-off-the-musical-stage
