1/1/2022,"By Katanga Johnson and Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican chair of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said on Friday she will step down from her role effective Feb. 4, 2022, removing a key remaining obstacle to President Joe Biden's ambitious banking reform agenda. Jelena McWilliams, a holdover from the Trump administration who was appointed to the role in June 2018, had previously said she intended to serve out her full term, which was set to expire in mid-2023. However, McWilliams is now outnumbered on the FDIC's board - which must vote on key rule-makings - by Democrats, sparking a messy public fight https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-fdic-chair-mcwilliams-says-vote-initiated-by-majority-democratic-members-out-2021-12-14 in recent weeks over who should set the agency's agenda. The five-member FDIC board currently has three members appointed by Democrats: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra, FDIC board member Martin Gruenberg, and acting head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Michael Hsu. McWilliams is the lone Republican, with one other position vacant. Gruenberg, who previously ran the agency under President Barack Obama, will serve as interim director. McWilliams' unexpected resignation will hand full control of the agency to Democrats, speeding up Biden's banking reform agenda which in many instances must be jointly agreed by all three federal banking regulators - the FDIC, the OCC and the Federal Reserve. Democrats are eager to take a tougher stance on banks, reverse breaks dished out by former President Donald Trump's regulators, boost competition, and tackle thorny issues including community lending rules, climate change and cryptocurrencies. All this should be easier with McWilliams out the way, analysts have said. Earlier this month she tried to block efforts by the board's Democratic members to solicit public feedback on changes to bank merger rules, which Democrats want to toughen up. ""Chair McWilliams started a political fight she couldn't win,"" Dennis Kelleher, president of the Washington-based advocacy group Better Markets, wrote in a tweet on Friday. McWilliams did not say why she was resigning and could not immediately be reached for comment on the public holiday. ""Throughout my tenure, the agency has focused on maintaining and instilling confidence in our banking system while at the same time promoting innovation, strengthening financial inclusion, improving transparency, and supporting community banks and minority depository institutions,"" she said in a statement. Analysts have previously suggested Gruenberg could be renominated to run the agency for another five-year term. Other names floated https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-wallstreet-regulators-factb-idUKKBN28716L by analysts and Washington insiders to replace McWilliams include Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor, and Michael Barr, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School and former Obama administration Treasury official, both of whom had previously been seen as possibilities for the Comptroller role.

1/1/2022,"A video of China police publicly shaming alleged human smugglers has gone viral on social media. Users on the social media platform Weibo are divided over whether the punishment was appropriate. Publicly parading and shaming suspects has been banned since the 1980s, according to the Global Times. A city in China paraded four alleged human smugglers through the streets in a public shaming exercise on Tuesday morning. A video capturing the parade was posted to Chinese social media, igniting fierce discussions on whether the move in the southern Chinese city of Jingxi was appropriate. The four men are accused of smuggling people across the border from Vietnam into China — despite China's borders remaining closed as a part of the country's COVID-zero policy. Clad in hazmat suits, the suspects were escorted by eight policemen wearing the same protective gear and accompanied by an even larger group of armed policemen. They walked down crowded streets in the southern Guangxi province as the suspects wore placards bearing their names and photos. Australian Broadcasting Corporation journalist and former China correspondent Bill Birtles reposted a copy of the video on his Twitter account. The state-run Guangxi Daily said the punishment ""effectively deters border-related crimes."" However, public shaming has been banned since the 1980s, according to state-backed Global Times. Users on the Chinese social media platform Weibo were divided over the punishment. ""Extraordinary means for extraordinary times,"" said Weibo user Mujian. User Anguanglu said China said the public punishment is a ""feudal"" practice, adding that it was hard to understand why Jingxi authorities would use the ""vile"" method to punish the suspects. ""A regression of civilization and the rule of law,"" commented another Weibo user. Global Times said the move by the authorities could itself be ""suspected of violating the law and is improper."" China's Ministry of Public Security told local authorities to ban ""rude law enforcement"" last year, the outlet added.

1/1/2022,"You might think the world’s wealthiest could date anyone they want — but who they choose to stay with may surprise you. Yes, there are a few 20-something supermodels, but some of these women have been with their billionaire partners for decades — well before their rise to riches. Many are media personalities, CEOs and investors, and several have devoted their lives to history-shaping philanthropic causes. Take a look at these billion-dollar better halves and their million-dollar meet-cute stories. The founder of Kora Organics skin care — and the first Australian model for Victoria’s Secret — tied the knot with the co-founder of Snapchat in 2017. Evan Spiegel, who became one of the world’s youngest billionaires at 25, first met Kerr at a Louis Vuitton event at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The supermodel told him her favorite song was Estonian composer Arvo Pärt’s “Spiegel im Spiegel.” Kerr was previously married to actor Orlando Bloom, and the pair has a son together. On Spiegel and Kerr’s first date, the Snap billionaire gifted her a homemade gingerbread house with her and her son’s names written on it in frosting. Today, Spiegel has a net worth of $9.2 billion, according to Forbes. The couple has two children together. Priscilla Chan met “nerdy” sophomore Mark Zuckerberg back in 2003 while waiting in line for the bathroom at his “going-away” party. He’d launched a prank website he thought would get him expelled from Harvard. Despite the not-so-romantic beginning, the pair started dating. Zuckerberg wasn’t expelled but did end up dropping out to work full-time on Facebook. Zuckerberg’s net worth is currently a whopping $123.1 billion. Chan married Zuckerberg in a surprise ceremony in 2012, after she graduated from medical school. The duo co-founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2015, pledging 99% of their wealth from Facebook shares toward building a better future through education, the justice system and health care. Chan and her husband also created nonprofit disease research center CZ Biohub in 2016. Chan eventually quit her job as a pediatrician to devote her time to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. The pair has two children, as well. By most standards, this Frida star and film producer is incredibly wealthy — but not when compared to her husband. François-Henri Pinault belongs to the Pinault family, which has an estimated fortune of $51.6 billion, Forbes says. Salma Hayek met Pinault at a Palazzo Grassi gala in Venice in 2006. The pair was married twice in 2009 — once in a quiet city hall ceremony in Paris on Valentine’s Day, and the second time in a star-studded event in a Venice opera house, complete with a masked ball at historic art museum Punta Della Dogana. Pinault is CEO and chairman of luxury group Kering, which his father founded in 1963. The conglomerate owns brands like Gucci and Balenciaga. Hayek favored the latter, wearing a stunning, ivory gown for her fairytale Venice wedding. Canadian musician Claire Boucher reportedly met the world's richest man and Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter, bonding over a joke involving an AI-powered dystopia and a French 18th century art style. (Of course.) Grimes’ music uses an eclectic mix of styles, which The Wall Street Journal once described as “the kind of music you imagine a group of vampires would listen to if this group of vampires also happened to be on a cheerleading squad.” While the couple has occasionally perplexed the public by unfollowing and refollowing each other on social media, they welcomed baby boy X Æ A-12 — pronounced ""X Ash A Twelve”, in case you were wondering — in 2020. Nicole Schuetz, founder of clean-energy investment firm Sutro, married billionaire Kevin Systrom at a jazz-age Halloween masquerade in Napa that one might deem Insta-worthy. Kevin, founder of Instagram, has a net worth of $2.3 billion. The pair reportedly met at their alma mater, Stanford, and got engaged in 2014, the same year Schuetz founded her own firm. The proposal was indirectly facilitated by their Instagram-famous golden retriever, Dolly, says Vogue. Kevin tricked her into thinking Dolly had run away, so he could lead her to just the right spot in front of the sunset. Nicole, who has an MBA/MS in Environment and Resources, created her consultancy to help channel funds into climate and clean energy solutions. If you also want to make money while making the world a better place, you can set up a sustainable portfolio in minutes — even if you're only investing your ""spare change."" This businesswoman and animal rights activist has been dating Oracle founder Larry Ellison for over a decade. Ellison, one of the richest men on the planet, has a net worth of $120.8 billion, owns almost all of Hawaiian island Lanai and sits on the board of Tesla. In 2013, he opened Malibu restaurant Nikita — yes, named after his girlfriend — with Mediterranean/Italian fare like Kobe beef sliders and lobster salad. The Hollywood Reporter dubs it “Gazillionaire Grub.” Kahn runs a real estate agency and has worked with the California Wildlife Center. She and her boyfriend made headlines in 2016 for donating $1.16 million to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park’s Rhino Rescue Center — and the rhino that’s named after her, as well. Google co-founder Larry Page booked an entire private island when he wed Lucinda Southworth in 2007 — with fellow billionaire Sir Richard Branson attending as best man. Southworth, who has a PhD in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford and holds degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Oxford, is a research scientist and philanthropist. The couple founded the charitable Carl Victor Page Memorial Foundation in 2004 and donated $15 million to fight Ebola in West Africa in 2018. Page stepped down as CEO of Alphabet, parent company of Google, in 2019 but remains a board member and controlling shareholder and has a net worth of $124.5 billion. In 1968, before Phil Knight made his billions, he was teaching Accounting 101 at Portland State University to help support a modest side-business. There he met star student Penelope Parks and asked her to join his imported shoe company, Blue Ribbon Sports. Parks, who worked on administrative tasks like bookkeeping and typing, began dating Knight, and the pair got married the same year. Three years later, Blue Ribbon Sports was rebranded to Nike, the footwear empire everyone knows today. The Knight family has a collective net worth of over $61 billion, Forbes says. In 2020, Phil and Penny made the second and third largest charitable donations of the year in the U.S., with $900 million toward the Knight Foundation and $300 million toward the University of Oregon. Part of that money is speculated to fund the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. The one-time wealthiest man in the world made headlines in 2019 for his $38 billion divorce with long-time wife Mackenzie Scott, but Jeff Bezos has since been spotted with TV anchor and host Lauren Sanchez. Sanchez and the retired Amazon CEO — who is worth over $194 billion, partly because people keep overpaying on Amazon — reportedly began dating while separated from their previous spouses in 2018. Sanchez is a licensed helicopter pilot and founder of Black Ops Aviation, an aerial film and production company. People reports she’s worked as a consultant on Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk and Catherine Hardwicke’s Miss Bala and she’s done some aerial shots for Bezos’ aerospace company, Blue Origin. Author and artist Ricky Lauren has been married to fashion designer Ralph Lauren for over half a century. Ricky was working as a receptionist at a doctor’s office in 1946 when Ralph came in for an appointment, says Port magazine — which also claims that he proposed on their very first date. They didn’t actually marry until much later — 1964 — and it would still be a few years before he launched his eponymous fashion brand. Ricky’s written five books, featuring her own photography and watercolor illustrations, and she and her husband own several properties, including a lovely stone manor in Bedford, New York and three beachside properties in the Hamptons. Ralph stepped down as CEO of his fashion company in 2015 but remains executive chairman and chief creative officer, with a net worth of $7.2 billion. Not much has been written about “Lady Branson,” long-time wife of billionaire British tycoon Sir Richard Branson. The investing news site Market Realist says Templeman was raised by a wealthy ship carpenter in Glasgow but worked several jobs to support herself before meeting Branson. At the time, she was still married to a Scottish keyboard player, Ronnie Leahy — but Branson was not deterred. The founder of Virgin Group told Page Six that he wooed Templeman with a romantic flyover of Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. He pretended to be interested in buying the property, but it was mainly an excuse to get her on a helicopter ride. He actually did end up buying the island in 1978 for $180,000, and the couple still live there today. They wed in 1989 and have two children together. This attorney and entrepreneur is a big player in the legal world, though she seems to value her privacy. She quietly married Google co-founder Sergey Brin in 2018, according to media reports, and didn’t announce the news until the following year. Shanahan is the founder of patent company ClearAccessIP and a research fellow at CodeX, the Stanford Center of Legal Informatics, which develops technologies to support the legal system. She also founded the Bia-Echo Foundation, which invests in social change, such as criminal justice reform and extending female fertility. Brin stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019 but remains a controlling shareholder and board member and has a net worth of $120 billion. The pair has one child together. The Dells met on a blind date in 1988, before Michael became a household name. He took his company, Dell Computer Corporation, public that same year, and the couple married in 1989. Susan Dell comes from a family of athletic and ambitious go-getters, and she is no exception. She’s competed in marathons, triathlons and cycling races across the world and founded three fashion labels — including luxury brand Phi, which shuttered during the 2009 recession. Susan and Michael, who share four children, also co-founded the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which is dedicated to helping impoverished children and families. She’s also a lifetime trustee of Dell Children’s Medical Center and a board member of the scientific research Cooper Institute in Dallas. This interior designer turned investor and philanthropist has been married to former Google CEO Eric Schmidt since 1980. The couple has been busy founding organizations to carry out their philanthropic goals. That includes the Schmidt Family Foundation (which focuses on sustainability), the Schmidt Ocean Institute (which promotes oceanographic research) and Schmidt Futures (which funds efforts to advance society through tech). Wendy remains president of the Schmidt Family Foundation and is also a competitive sailor. She founded oceans solutions initiative 11th Hour Racing in 2010. Eric left the board of Alphabet in 2019 and retired from his position as technical advisor in 2020. He still has a net worth of $24.1 billion. Internationally renowned concert pianist Hélène Mercier first met the French fashion tycoon at a dinner party in 1989 — and insisted he play the piano for her on a New Year’s date later that year. “His hands were trembling, he was dying of fear, but he was determined to get to the end,"" Mercier told The Wall Street Journal. The pair wed in 1990 in a private ceremony in France, with Mercier in a white Lacroix suit and her husband in white jeans and a blue blazer. Despite her busy schedule — she performs at around 20 concerts a year and practices two to six hours a day — she often attends fashion events with Arnault. Arnault, who had eclipsed Jeff Bezos as richest man in the world in May 2021, is the chairman and CEO of LVMH, an empire that spans brands from Louis Vuitton to Marc Jacobs. He and his family currently have a net worth of $199.9 billion. Nita Dalal, a trained bharatanatyam dancer, wed into the wealthiest family in India in 1985. She’s a formidable businesswoman herself, serving as a board member of the family business, Reliance Industries as well as East India Hotels and she is a co-owner of cricket team Mumbai Indians. She’s also a founder and chairperson at Dhirubhai Ambani International School — one of India’s top international schools — and Football Sports Development Limited, an organization that aims to develop sports in India through grassroots programs. This year, she also launched Her Circle, a female-focused, community-building platform. Husband Mukesh has a net worth of $89.9 billion. He inherited conglomerate Reliance Industries, which is involved in natural resources, retail and telecommunications, following the death of his father in 2002, and serves as CEO. Connie and Steve Ballmer wed in 1990 and have three sons together. While Steve’s recently been recognized for his generous philanthropic efforts, Connie says she’s more of a “save-the-world person” than her husband is. “I need him to catch up with me. It's all really new for him,” she told Forbes, after her husband left the helm of Microsoft in 2014. Connie is the co-founder of Ballmer Group, which focuses on improving economic mobility for impoverished American children and families, and also serves as a general partner and founding investor at Blue Meridian Partners. She is also on the boards of the Obama Foundation, StriveTogether and the Los Angeles Clippers Foundation. Connie earned her bachelor’s degree in journalism at the University of Oregon and previously served as a founding member of the school’s governing board for seven years. The former New York superintendent of banks and unofficial “First Lady of New York City” has been in a relationship with Mike Bloomberg since 2000. The pair first met at a business luncheon where Bloomberg was speaking and later ended up dining at the same restaurant. “He looked at me and came over and said, ‘Would you like to have a drink after this?’” Taylor told The Washington Post. Obviously, she said yes. Diana Taylor has an MBA and public health degree from Columbia, and she’s worked on Wall Street and held a number of high-profile roles, including deputy secretary to former New York Governor George Pataki, managing director at Wolfensohn Fund Management, vice president of KeySpan Energy and vice chair of Solera Capital. She currently serves on the boards of Citigroup, Brookfield Asset Management and Sotheby’s, and some charitable boards and initiatives as well, like the International Women's Health Coalition. Interior designer Jennifer Gilbert first met the billionaire co-founder of mortgage lending company Quicken Loans when she designed his office. The Michigan State University graduate stepped back from her career after getting married — she and Dan have five kids together — but began getting back to work when her youngest was in preschool. She founded online interior design resource Doodle Home in 2010 and Amber Engine, a Detroit-based home furnishings company, in 2015. She’s also the founder and creative director at Pophouse, which focuses on workplace design. She has designed spaces for Quicken Loans as well. She and Dan founded the Gilbert Family Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to finding a cure for neurofibromatosis — a genetic disorder that one of their children suffers from. This The Wall Street Journal reporter got set up on a blind date with Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. The pair hit it off immediately and later wed in 2013. Cari Tuna and Moskovitz became the youngest couple to sign the Giving Pledge — Warren Buffet and Bill and Melinda Gates’ campaign for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth — in 2010. Moskovitz, who currently serves as CEO of project management solution company Asana, has a net worth of $21.6 billion. Tuna, a Yale graduate, quit her job in 2011 when Moskovitz was named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire to focus on her charitable efforts full time. The couple founded their philanthropic foundation for helping “humanity thrive”, Good Ventures, together that same year and have given away millions of dollars since. Indian-American artist Elissa Patel Waverly and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky swiped right on each other on Tinder in 2013 and have been going steady ever since. Unfortunately, Patel Waverly’s first experience on an Airbnb boat in India was less than appealing. “There were a lot of bugs and I'm very scared of bugs. Brian's one job in our relationship is to kill bugs and he wasn't there,” she told Condé Nast Traveller. She previously worked as a community marketing manager at selfie app Frontback, as a marketing operations consultant at grocery e-commerce platform Mercatus and as an account executive at payment service provider WePay. She has since moved away from her marketing career to focus on her career as an artist. Her brand East Darjeeling employs local talent and donates to the cause of helping underprivileged communities around the world. Patel Waverly also has a degree in marketing from Santa Clara University and studied international business at the Imperial College London and finance and economics at Shanghai University. Deirdre Hindmarsh met fellow student James Dyson at the Byam Shaw School of Art in 1966 and the couple wed two years later — years before Dyson became the billionaire vacuum kingpin he’s known as today. Deirdre used to teach art to support their family as James struggled with his inventions. She’s now known as a fine artist and fabric expert and has designed contemporary carpets and rugs for over two decades. The trained soprano also hosts a charitable opera event each year and the proceeds go toward medical research charities. The couple founded a charity, The James and Deirdre Dyson Trust, which supports causes such as arts, health care and education. Pam and Pierre Omidyar were college sweethearts before he earned his billions from creating online auction site eBay — the long-standing rumor that he set up his site to help his then-girlfriend, now-wife collect Pez candy dispensers has since been debunked. Pam, a self-professed ocean lover, has a bachelor’s degree in biology from Tufts University and a master’s in plant molecular genetics from the University of California, Santa Cruz. When her husband’s company went public in 1998, the couple immediately decided they’d donate most of their wealth within their lifetimes. Pierre currently has a net worth of $18.2 billion. Pam co-founded The Omidyar Network, a foundation that supports social and economic change, with her husband in 2004. She also sits on the board of Humanity United, an organization focused on ending human rights abuses, and Hopelab, a non-for-profit that designs technologies to improve the health and well-being of young people, which she also founded. Few people are dazzling, daring and lucky enough to marry rich. If you want to become a millionaire, you'll probably need to take a more pedestrian approach. It's a long and challenging road, but you can get started with some of these simple money-saving and money-making tips: Land a better mortgage rate. Interest rates are historically low right now, but they may not stay that way for long. If you refinance, you may be able to save hundreds each month and thousands over the lifespan of your loan. Consolidate high interest debt. With interest rates as bad as 20% — or even worse — credit cards make it easy to fall into debt. Combining all of your balances into one loan with a much lower interest rate can help you save hundreds and free yourself from debt faster. Invest in a ""fine"" asset. Returns on fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol have crushed the S&P 500 in recent years. That used to be an option only for the ultra rich, but with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. Turn pennies into a portfolio. Even if you don't have much money to spare, you can still earn big returns from today’s runaway stock market. A popular app will help you invest your “spare change” from everyday purchases.

1/1/2022,"I guess you could say I had a mild mid-life crisis. My kids are growing up fast, and I want to be a fit and active parent. As I’ve moved into my mid-40’s I’ve been more and more conscious of my health and the need to find a better balance with work and family commitments to enable me to put more time into my own wellbeing. Prior to COVID, I was traveling a lot for work and it was hard for me to get into a routine—or at least that was my principle excuse. It dawned on me last summer that one of the silver linings of this pandemic was that I wasn’t travelling, and I decided it was now or never. I’d been trying to get in better shape for some time, but struggled to be disciplined and consistent in diet and exercise. My wife knew of a couple of people who were training with Ultimate Performance in Hong Kong and she kept showing me the results. The final straw that motivated me to get in touch was that she showed me one of these transformations after a particularly unhealthy couple of days! Above all, I want to be a role model for both my son and daughter and to promote an active lifestyle. We’re an active family and they are both involved in lots of sports; my son Harry is particularly passionate about sport in general. He’s only eight and I’ve been pretty involved to date but looking ahead I’m really motivated to stay fit and healthy and set a great example for him as he grows up – and participate myself where possible! I also have two brothers and one of them lives in Hong Kong too. We’re quite competitive, so I also set myself a little side challenge to inspire him to sign up to UP. I think after seeing my results he was driven to try and better me so he did sign up and has had a really impressive transformation with UP in the last few months too. I had done weight training before, but never with this kind of targeted focus and detailed coaching. When I began the transformation challenge, I was physically fit in a cardio sense, but pretty out of shape; I had 27 percent bodyfat and subpar upper body muscle condition. My core was also quite weak. The first thing we did was reduce my daily calories to 1,500, with the majority of that being taken up by protein. I also upped my water consumption. I used to intermittent fast and eat quite lean Monday to Friday, but weekends I rarely controlled myself so would eat too many carbs. During the transformation I was extremely disciplined. I weighed out all my portions and put everything into an app (much to the frustration of my family as I was always tapping away on the phone). I had very few cheat days also. I found it tough to eat enough protein, so had a daily whey protein shake and the occasional protein bar also. I also ate a lot more vegetables! The biggest and most eye opening lesson for me was the impact of carbohydrates on glycogen storage and water retention in particular. In the past I’ve struggled with really fluctuating weight and now I know so much more about how my body works and how to control that. From a work out standpoint and I know a lot more about how to put together workout and target specific muscle groups. I’m still a novice but feel much more confident and productive in the gym now. I was in the gym just three days a week, but I also did light cardio on the intermittent days, including 5km runs, trail runs, and cycling. Most weeks I took a day off with no exercise but at one point I got in a routine of seven days a week and I felt good for it. I enjoyed a lot of the exercises, although I found squats and deadlifts tough, split squats and pendulum squats especially. However, these exercises have made a massive impact on my core strength and I’ve noticed that my historic lower back weakness has been so much better. No pain no gain! As a parent with a busy career it’s hard to find the time before or after work every day, and there is huge demand for sessions before 9 a.m., at lunchtime and after 5 p.m. I was lucky to have a supportive family and employer, and be able to shift my working schedule to enable me to go to the gym a couple of times a week at less busy periods during the working day giving me back some time to be present at home as a parent on those days. Of course I still had to get up early or train late a couple of days and on weekends but flexibility at work gave me the balance to sustain it and establish healthy habits. Over the duration of three and a half months, I lost about 26 pounds, went from 27 percent to 13 percent bodyfat, and increased my muscle mass by about 3 pounds. Aside from the obvious physical results, the biggest associated gain was cognitive function. I found that I was quicker, sharper and more productive at work and definitely had more energy. I also completely stopped snoring, which was popular at home! I had a few limiting beliefs to begin with about whether I could get below 80kg (176 pounds) and sustain there. I got to 72.5kg (160 pounds) in the end so I’ve absolutely changed those beliefs and I’m really confident I can sustain it. I feel much more in control of my health which also helps when I do want to just relax and enjoy some indulgent food or drinks or rest for a few days. That doesn’t knock me off track as it might have done before. I think I have a bit further to go, although I would say I have definitely done the hard part. But I still have some goals remaining, and I know I can achieve more. My advice to anybody who wants to work on their own fitness would be to get a trainer who supports you outside the gym, as well as in it. Time in the gym is important, but the biggest thing for me was having someone there to make me make the healthy choices when I was struggling to motivate myself. Whether it was putting in an extra 3,000 steps to hit my daily goal, choosing the right food to order in a restaurant, going for a run at 10 p.m. after a long day at work or so many other tipping points that got me to my goal. The reason I achieved this was because I had my trainer Dan there keeping me on the straight and narrow outside the gym as much as in it. Also, look beyond the cost and don’t think of it on a “per gym session” basis! One big concern I had that almost stopped me was the price of personal training. On reflection, when I look at the time Dan put aside for me literally every day in and out of the gym the value is so much more palatable. I couldn’t have done it on my own and I’ve realised that at my age, health is worth every dollar invested.
