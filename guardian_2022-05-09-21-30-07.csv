5/9/2022,"Britain would support and provide assistance to Poland or any other central or eastern European country willing to supply Russian-designed jet fighters to Ukraine, the defence secretary has said. Ben Wallace said on Monday the UK would “stand by any country who makes that choice” and would “defend their right to do it” – although it is a step that no country has been willing to take for fear of Russian reprisals. A plan for Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets familiar to Ukraine’s pilots in March via the US collapsed after White House objections – and has not been revived despite Kyiv’s repeated call for more airpower to defend itself. When asked about whether Ukraine still needed more powerful weapons to force out the Russian invaders, Wallace said the UK had supported the idea of a Polish jet transfer at the time – and continued to do so. “If Poland chose to do that we would support them,” he said. Britain would be willing to backfill – lend airpower to make good any shortfall – Wallace said, highlighting that in April the UK agreed to send two additional Typhoon jets to Romania, taking its total contingent to six, as part of a Black Sea air policing mission. Poland, Slovakia and Bulgaria have a handful of MiG-29 jets that could in theory be given to Ukraine, but the US and other western countries have worried that such a move could be dangerously escalatory, given that Nato has agreed it does not want to enforce a no-fly zone or more directly go to war with Russia. But during the past month, the west has stepped up its supply of weapons, with the US giving 155mm Nato standard howitzers, Germany supplying Gepard 2 mobile artillery and Britain providing a range of armoured vehicles for troop movement. Wallace said that both he and Boris Johnson wanted to “do everything we can” to try and meet Ukraine’s military needs – but acknowledged that the issue of air power was a remaining area of discussion amongst western donors. “The only real key is the debate about air,” Wallace said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine amounted to the beginning of a new cold war, Wallace said, arguing that whatever happened in the war Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, was likely to be “around for some time” afterwards. Nato countries would have to ask “how are we going to contain him and his Russia” in a way that provided security and safety to Europe, said the defence minister, who added: “I’m an old soul, I do remember the cold war.” Eastern and central European countries want the UK and western allies to send more troops to garrison the alliance’s Russian flank. That plus ongoing support to Ukraine is likely to lead to growing pressure to increase defence spending from its existing level of about 2% of GDP, the floor target set by Nato. Wallace’s remarks came in response to questions after a speech timed to coincide with Russia’s 9 May Victory Day parades commemorating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war. In it he had accused Putin and his inner political circle of “mirroring” the fascism of the Nazis by attacking Ukraine.",News/Politics,UK would support countries willing to supply Russian-designed jets to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/uk-support-countries-supply-russian-jets-ukraine-ben-wallace
5/9/2022,"Tuesday’s Queen’s speech is meant to be a relaunch for Boris Johnson’s beleaguered government, against the backdrop of a deep cost of living crisis, and with Tory backbenchers still divided about his future. But if the advance briefing is anything to go by, this is an administration with little fresh to offer. A “bonfire of red tape” is certainly not revolutionary: Gordon Brown had the Hampton review and the Better Regulation taskforce; George Osborne had his own “bonfire of red tape”, not to mention a “Red Tape Challenge”. With the benefit of hindsight, most such efforts are widely viewed as worthy, but incremental. Of course, freed from the shackles of the EU, the government has more wriggle room to make regulatory change; but the examples given by Boris Johnson during the leave campaign – the size of olive oil bottles and the packaging for fish – underline the modest scale of what is likely to be possible. Such tweaks would also almost certainly be dwarfed by post-Brexit border bureaucracy. Some bills will enact crucial but long-promised changes, such as reform of the school funding formula, or ensuring Companies House, the official register of companies, combats fraud. Other plans, such as the levelling up bill, giving local authorities the power to force landlords to rent out empty shops and take control of empty buildings, appear modest, but are clearly designed to deliver the changes “red wall” voters may hope to see if they are to stick with Johnson at the next general election. A new British Bill of Rights, meanwhile, allows the government to keep one of its favourite culture wars – the battle against “lefty lawyers” – burning brightly, while Channel 4 privatisation would cheer the party’s rightwingers. But the overall sense, as with mooted plans for tackling the cost of living crisis that included two-yearly MOTs, is of a government scrabbling around for ideas. Part of the difficulty, for an administration which has never had much of a guiding purpose beyond Brexit and keeping Johnson in power, is knowing what its electoral constituency is. In Friday’s local election results, the Tories received a kicking from the Lib Dems in the south, amplifying the warning signal sent by the Chesham and Amersham byelection last year. So the list of expected bills appears shot through with the contradictions of trying to keep north and south, red wall and blue wall, onside. Hence the toned-down planning reform mooted by Michael Gove at the weekend: gone is the no-holds-barred approach drawn up by his predecessor, Robert Jenrick, that was intended to disfranchise Nimbies and lead to a drastic increase in housebuilding. Instead, local authorities will apparently be given more latitude in applying housing targets; and Gove was full of soothing talk of small-c conservative developments such as Prince Charles’s favourite, Poundbury in Dorset. While CCHQ sources continue to deny that an autumn election is even a remote possibility, there is also a whiff of Lynton Crosby’s notorious advice to David Cameron to “get the barnacles off the boat”, too. Gone is the ban on foie gras and fur, it appears – and gone, too, the employment bill that would have strengthened workers’ rights, but perhaps couldn’t be easily shoehorned into the theme of levelling up. Plenty of legislative time will also be taken up working through bills carried over from the last parliamentary session – including on animal welfare and online safety. It remains to be seen whether Johnson can fashion a coherent narrative out of Tuesday’s pomp and ceremony. But as after Rishi Sunak’s spring statement, there is a clear risk that again, the main impression is of a government that has failed to grasp the scale of the crisis at hand.",News/Politics,Queen’s speech preview shows a government scrabbling around for ideas,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/queen-speech-preview-bills-boris-johnson
5/9/2022,"Ilove ketchups. I love how their tart sweetness makes my mouth water, and how you can preserve a whole gamut of fruits by cooking them down with onion and spicing in this sweet-sour celebration. The barely-there scent of cucumber in today’s ketchup works wonderfully with fish; I like to highlight the lightness of both with a herb-flecked barley salad peppered with the sweet crunch of apple and toasted seeds. A summery dish that smacks of seaside holidays, and perfect for the forthcoming jubilee celebrations. The smokiness that comes from grilling the mackerel works beautifully with the sharpness of the ketchup. You can also roast the fish instead, if you prefer.

Put everything in a blender, puree until smooth, then pour into a large saucepan and bring to a simmer. When the mix starts to bubble, turn down the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 35-40 minutes, until reduced by a third. Meanwhile, bring a pan of salted water to a boil, then simmer the pearl barley according to the packet instructions (usually 25-30 minutes), until tender. While the barley is cooking, toast the sunflower seeds in a dry pan until lightly browned, then tip into a small bowl. Once the pearl barley is cooked, drain and empty into a separate bowl, dress with the olive oil and lemon juice, and season. Heat the grill to its highest setting. Season the mackerel and rub all over with a little oil. Grill for three to four minutes on one side, then turn over and grill for a few minutes more on the other side, until a skewer slides easily into the thickest part of the fish with no resistance. Toss the barley with the remaining salad ingredients, setting aside some of the herb mix to garnish, and pile on to plates with the mackerel and spoonfuls of cucumber ketchup.

5/9/2022,"Attempting to do a second world war aviation picture on a microbudget certainly meets the definition of underdog British pluck. But unlike the RAF in the Battle of Britain, Spitfire Over Berlin can’t surmount overwhelming odds. It’s somewhat frustrating because it’s not the visuals that let Callum Burn’s film down (though some of the CGI used for the external scenes is much too clean-looking); it’s the cliche-ballasted script, without enough fuel to fill an hour-and-a-quarter runtime, that sends the film blazing groundwards. Spitfire pilot Edward (Kris Saddler), who enjoys buzzing English hedgerows on practice flights, seems to be the local daredevil in residence. But he draws the short straw when he is the only man available for Operation Extreme Jeopardy: to take an unarmed observation plane over Berlin to photograph defence installations in order to dissuade an American squadron that is obliviously about to undertake a suicide mission. Burn intersperses Edward’s German mission with black-and-white flashbacks to a previous sortie gone awry, which generates a small amount of narrative heat. They can’t disguise the almost complete lack of drama in the present-day sections, with budget limitations, presumably, meaning no closeup shots of whatever it is Edward is photographing. Without that, the film languishes in a sunlit limbo, alternating flatly between CGI externals of the place and cockpit closeups. The light switching from green to red, as the onboard camera goes on the blink, does not qualify as the stuff of high-adrenaline cinema. It is possible for a low-budget film to snare viewers with a claustrophobic premise, as Stephen Knight’s concrete-pour nail-biter Locke showed in 2013. It would have to work far more inventively than Burn’s film, though. Edward mostly just monologues away to Georgie, the pin-up girl tucked next to his flight display, presumably looking for some Matter of Life and Death lyrical uplift. But the film is over-reliant on this device; and given how inert the rest of it feels, the effect is more like an amateur flyboy having a nervous breakdown on the tarmac at a country airshow. Spitfire Over Berlin’s ambition is laudable, and the flight sequences are precise and technically accomplished for a DIY production. But it needs to take a good hard look under the hood.  Spitfire Over Berlin is released in cinemas on 13 May.",Arts/Film,Spitfire Over Berlin review – jolly British pluck only gets low-budget war film so far,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/09/spitfire-over-berlin-review-second-world-war-aviation-drama
5/9/2022,"A body representing football writers in Scotland has apologised after a speaker’s sexist and misogynistic jokes prompted attendees to walk out of its annual awards dinner. The backlash to remarks at Sunday’s Scottish Football Writers’ Association event, which also saw Sir Alex Ferguson receive a lifetime achievement award, has seen the body pledge to review its format. Gabriella Bennett, the co-chair of Women In Journalism Scotland, told BBC Radio Scotland: “I really enjoy it as an event, but there are always off-colour jokes made by the speakers … sexist or misogynistic. But last night’s speech was really next-level. I walked out after about five minutes of maybe a 20-minute speech. “My table stood up to leave, and I saw Eilidh Barbour and people on her table start to leave. But there were loads of people laughing at these jokes. We were two tables in an enormous room and lots of people found it really funny, so there’s lots of work that we still need to do in really changing people’s minds about what’s acceptable. “I’m no longer shocked or surprised by these kind of offensive remarks masquerading as banter … but I am sickened – by normalising this kind of thing, by minimising these kind of remarks … it’s incredibly insidious. It’s really damaging for women trying to be respected. It allows men to speak to women in a certain way in a professional situation.” Broadcaster Barbour, who has helmed coverage of various sports for the BBC, Sky Sports and Amazon Prime Video, tweeted: “Never felt so unwelcome in the industry I work in than sitting at the Scottish Football Writers Awards. A huge reminder there is still so much to do in making our game an equal place #callitout #equalgame.” In a statement, the Scottish Football Writers’ Association said it “apologises to anyone offended or upset by material from one of our after-dinner speakers”. The statement added: “We have agreed unanimously that this will act as a catalyst to review and improve the format of our future events to make it an enjoyable and inspirational event for all.”",Sport/Football,Scottish football writers’ body sorry as ‘next-level’ sexist jokes prompt walk-out,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/scottish-football-writers-association-sorry-sexist-jokes-prompt-walk-out
5/9/2022,"Food bank users were pursued for parking charges of up to £170 and threatened with court action after an enforcement company took over management of a community centre car park in Sunderland. Clients and volunteers at the Youth Almighty Project (Yap), which runs a food bank and community services, were hit with parking charge notices (PCNs) for using the charity’s free car park after the firm contracted to manage the site was taken over by an Australian multinational called Smart Parking. “They have begun issuing £100 tickets (reduced to £60 if paid within 14 days) to anyone that uses the car park, including me and my staff, even though we own the site,” Phil Tye, the Yap chair, said. “Even after we’ve contested them, people are receiving letters from a debt collection agency demanding £170 and threatening legal action if they don’t pay within seven days.” It was only after Guardian Money contacted Smart Parking that the charges were cancelled. Parking enforcement companies patrol privately owned car parks on behalf of landlords to crack down on drivers who trespass, overstay or fail to pay. Typically, the firms receive the income from PCNs, which can be up to £100 each, rather than payments from the landlord. The sector has been criticised for disproportionate charges for minor infringements of parking rules and in February, the government announced plans to cap most private parking charges at £50. It will also force firms to allow drivers a 10-minute grace period before issuing a PCN. A new code of practice will make it easier for drivers to challenge tickets if there are mitigating circumstances and restrict fees levied by debt collection agents. At the time the changes were announced the minister for levelling up, Neil O’Brien, said private firms were issuing roughly 22,000 parking tickets a day, and often charged “unreasonable fees”. Yap took on Enterprise Parking Solutions in 2020 to stop unauthorised drivers using its car park. Permitted vehicles belonging to staff and customers were registered on a white list and any PCNS issued to them were routinely cancelled, according to Tye. However last August, Enterprise and its 68 sites was acquired by Smart Parking, which manages car parks for retail parks and supermarket chains across the UK. Tye said Yap did not know about the takeover until an engineer turned up and change over some equipment. “Since then, instead of logging authorised vehicles on a white list, we have to email the details, but the emails are not acted on and Smart Parking is failing to cancel erroneously issued PCNs,” he added. The charitysaid it did not receive a new contract from Smart Parking, which has refused to release it from the three-year agreement signed with Enterprise. When Tye demanded Smart Parking withdraw from the site, he received a letter from the firm’s lawyers threatening court proceedings to recover “significant” lost profits and legal costs. “A multimillion-pound global company is making profits from hungry families,” Tye said. “How can this be legal?” The benefit of a contract can lawfully be transferred to a new company without the agreement of the client under certain circumstances, according to Emma Marshall, a senior associate in the commercial dispute resolution practice at the law firm Browne Jacobson. “It depends on whether the contract provided for what would happen on a change in the ownership of the company’s assets and whether the old owner complied with any conditions in the contract,” she said. Yap’s contract with Enterprise states that the benefit – the income stream – can be assigned to a third party. Smart Parking cancelled 19 PCNs issued to volunteers and users within 24 hours of Guardian Money’s intervention. It has since agreed to refund other drivers who claim they were incorrectly charged. It declined to explain why it had not previously responded to evidence the PCNs had been incorrectly issued. A spokesperson said: “Following an exchange of communications we have spoken to Mr Tye and after a good meeting we have agreed a strategy for moving forward. We very much look forward to working together into the future.” ",Lifestyle/Money,Food bank users and volunteers threatened with £170 parking fines,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/09/food-bank-users-threatened-with-170-parking-fine
5/9/2022,"A Massachusetts family was in for a surprise when it wanted to give a stray puppy a dog’s chance and brought it home. The family rescued the dog after finding it worse for wear on the side of the road. But when experts were consulted they quickly concluded it was a coyote, according to the Cape Wildlife Center in Barnstable. The eastern coyote pup appeared to have become separated from its animal family at much too young an age to be able to flourish independently. It and was found “wandering and distressed by the side of a busy road,” the center said. “He was then accidentally taken home by a local family after they mistakenly identified him as a lost puppy. After realizing their mix-up they called us for assistance. “With the help of the Mass department of public health we were able to determine there was no potential exposure risk to rabies, and were able to clear him for care, and granted permission to rehab by Mass Wildlife,” the center added. The coyote pup has been recovering in the center’s isolation ward. A foster sibling from the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island has arrived at the Barnstable center and will be introduced to the pup soon. The cape center plans to raise the two pups together in its outdoor caging once they have been vaccinated. “They will be raised together and will be given a chance [to] grow and learn natural behaviors,” the center said, adding: “We work hard to give them as much of a natural upbringing as possible.” Although the coyote pup was saved, the center warned that the case could have easily gone awry, as coyotes are considered a rabies vector species in Massachusetts, or common carriers, also including raccoons, skunks, bats and woodchucks. “We are grateful to every single person who takes time out of their day to help wildlife when they are in need, but we always encourage people to call the appropriate resources prior to intervening,” the center said.",News/US news,Lost puppy taken in by US family turns out to be coyote,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/lost-puppy-us-family-massachusetts-coyote
5/9/2022,"Northampton Town plan to lodge a formal complaint with the English Football League because they believe Scunthorpe United’s team selection at Bristol Rovers compromised the integrity of the final day in League Two, which saw Rovers beat Northampton to the final automatic promotion place on goals scored. It is understood Northampton, who won 3-1 at Barrow last Saturday, have raised concerns with the EFL and the Football Association about the circumstances surrounding a wild final day. Rovers were promoted on goals scored, with their 71 superior to Northampton’s 60, after the clubs finished level on points and goal difference. Northampton face Mansfield in the playoff semi-final first leg on Saturday. Rovers went into the final day needing to overturn Northampton’s five-goal advantage and scored five second-half goals to win 7-0 at home to Scunthorpe, who named seven teenagers in their starting lineup and four players from their Under-18s side, including 17-year-old first-year scholar goalkeeper Owen Foster. Scunthorpe were relegated last month and finished the season with four wins, one of which was away from home. Scunthorpe made three changes from their previous game against Hartlepool, with second-year scholar Oliver Lobley, whose own goal gave Rovers the lead at the Memorial Stadium, making his league debut. As at home to Hartlepool, Liam Feeney, 36, and Anthony Grant, 34, started on the substitutes’ bench. The average age of the starting lineup was 20. EFL guidance states that from the fourth Thursday in March, any team sheet for a league game should include at least 10 outfield players who featured on the team sheet for the previous league game. Scunthorpe adhered to such instruction. Rovers will be investigated by the FA for the pitch invasion which occurred in the 85th minute following their seventh goal. The Scunthorpe manager, Keith Hill, said his team were “hopeless” in defeat and declined to discuss whether his goalkeeper was punched by a home fan during the pitch invasion on 85 minutes. “I don’t really want to talk about it,” he said. “The referee’s done a report and I want to leave it with them. I don’t want to spoil what is a tremendous day for Bristol Rovers and Joey. About the health and safety of me and my staff in my technical area during the course of the game, and with respect to what did happen, the referee is going to file a report to the FA.” Scunthorpe have been approached for comment. The EFL have declined to comment.

5/9/2022,"Concerns about the extent to which racing fans have “got out of the habit” of going to the track during the pandemic can only increase following the news that Chester’s prestigious May Festival from Wednesday to Friday last week attracted a total attendance of 35,000 – a 35% drop from the 53,500 who were at the course over the same three days in 2019. Chester is – according to Guinness World Records, at least – the world’s “oldest racecourse still in operation” with a history dating back to 1539, and also one of Britain’s best-attended tracks, thanks in part to its memorable setting and layout, between the historic city’s Roman walls and the River Dee. In 2019, its 15 meetings, all on the Flat, attracted a total of 240,541 racegoers, an average attendance of 16,000 for every card, while the reported crowds for the three-day May Festival were 15,340, 15,148 and then 22,926 for the Chester Cup on Friday. All British racing was suspended in May 2020 and the meeting was cancelled, while the sport was still behind closed doors when the May Festival returned in 2021. The first renewal with full crowds for three years, however, pulled in “8,000 then just over 11,000 and just over 15,000” according to Louise Stewart, the track’s new chief executive, who was overseeing her first May Festival last week. That represents a significant loss in revenue, not just for the racecourse but the local economy as a whole. Chester was noticeably quiet on Wednesday, both at the track and in the city – eerily so for veterans of a meeting where the daily attendance had not previously dropped below 11,000 this century – and while there was much more of an atmosphere on Thursday and Friday, there was still plenty of breathing space for the Roodee’s racegoers. That, of course, may have made it a more enjoyable afternoon for the punters, and shorter queues for bars, toilets and betting may well have upped the spend-per-racegoer. But the huge hit to ticket revenue will be a hefty blow to absorb, for all that the course was expecting a drop in numbers. “What we have seen is lower walk-ups than in previous years, and that is common across all racecourses at the moment,” Stewart said on Monday. “There are also a lot of variables at play, especially with the May Festival. People have got out of the habit of going racing, the weather was quite bad the last time [it was staged with a full attendance] and there’s also what’s happening in the wider world. “There was an obvious bounce-back in the events sector after the pandemic when people were delighted to be out and spending again, but now there is the cost of living crisis and the cost of fuel, there are quite a few new variables and it’s very difficult for anyone to predict how it is going to play out. “We’ve yet to analyse spend-per-head across the three days but the rest of the season looks strong and we will still be offering our open course ticket in the summer, which means that you can park up close to trackside for £10. It really is a course with something for everyone.” Catterick 1.30 Langholm2.00 Fragrance2.30 Blackcurrent3.00 Haven Lady3.30 Ustath4.00 Tiger Spirit4.30 MahanakhonWolverhampton1.40 Bang On The Bell2.10 Global Effort2.40 You're Cool3.10 Jenny Ren3.40 Robasta4.10 Hachert4.40 Four Feet5.13 Courtside (nap)Musselburgh1.45 Chattel Village2.20 Ayr Empress2.50 Sun Festival3.20 Aquamas3.50 Albegone4.20 Rum Going On4.50 BramhamWindsor5.05 Carp Kid5.40 Radio Goo Goo6.10 Tomouh6.40 Modern News7.10 Royal Aviation (nb)7.40 Crystal Delight8.10 Punda MariaSouthwell5.20 Capricia5.50 Percussion6.20 Treyarnon Bay6.50 Clear The Runway7.20 Coastguard Station7.50 Mr Dealer8.20 Brianna Rose Significant meetings at Newmarket, Sandown and Newbury have all seen substantial drops in attendance compared to 2019 in recent weeks and months.

5/9/2022,"Chepalungu forest has been at the heart of Kenya’s Kipsigis community for as long as anyone can remember. It is also a source of streams that recharge the Mara River and, owing to its proximity to the Maasai Mara national reserve, a refuge for wildlife. But during widespread protests following the presidential election results in 2007, much of the forest in Bomet county, south of the Rift Valley, was destroyed and the trees felled. Joseph Towett, an elder from the community and a passionate conservationist, remembers the devastation. “Trees were regarded as a home for animals and birds, so cutting them was like destroying them. The destruction was like a curse,” he says. The disappearance of indigenous trees such as African wild olive, cedar, red stinkwood and nandi flame, was not just a blow to biodiversity but also to the Kipsigis’ way of life. The forest is a valuable source of herbs and plants for medicines and traditional ceremonies. “Without these plants, our ceremonies lack authenticity and this poses a big problem for our community,” says David Sigei, who lives next to the forest. “When the forest was destroyed, some of these trees disappeared.” Chepalungu forest reserve is managed by Kenya Forest Service (KFS) and stretches across 4,871 hectares (12,000 acres) divided into two blocks: Siongiroi with 871 hectares and Kapchumbe with 4,000 hectares. Although the forest is overseen by KFS, with the help of international organisations such as the WWF and US Forest Service, local communities are playing a central role in bringing the forest back to life. In 2008, Towett set up the Chepalungu Apex Community Forest Association, which is owned and managed by local people, with the aim of reintroducing lost tree species. By getting involved in tree planting, the community has managed to restore more than 160 hectares of land and cover it with trees once again. The Kipsigis people’s livelihood and culture are deeply embedded in nature, says Towett, making them key to conserving the forest’s biodiversity and mitigating the impact of the climate crisis. Past changes in land use and planting exotic trees for commercial purposes have contributed to the loss of indigenous species. Now, villagers are taking a collective responsibility for managing, conserving and participating in tree planting. “When the community discovered that they were losing a very important aspect of the environment, they started being actively involved in conservation,” says Sigei. Jane Rotich, a forest scout and advocate for traditional herbal remedies, says that during the Covid lockdown in Kenya fewer people were able to access health facilities and many turned to traditional medicinal plants, leading the community to step up efforts to preserve and plant indigenous trees. “Unlike before, you don’t struggle looking for these plants. They have grown again and are easily accessible,” she says. The county government of Bomet has prioritised the free provision of indigenous seedlings for the communities in Chepalungu forest. “We have established a database list of extinct indigenous tree species and we insist on buying more of these than exotic seeds,” says Gilbert K Korir, an environment officer for the county. In Chepalungu forest, they have successfully planted 90,000 trees and indigenous species are regenerating well. But while they have the support of the community, the climate crisis still poses a threat to the forest. “Unreliability of rainfall is the greatest challenge to restoration programmes,” says Timothy Oyondi, Chepalungu forest station manager for the KFS. Ousseynou Ndoye, the regional coordinator for west and central Africa at the African Forest Landscape Restoration initiative, an effort to restore 100m hectares of land in Africa by 2030, emphasises the importance of small communities in restoring nature across the continent. “They restore small areas of degraded forests and lands which, when aggregated, become very significant. They are the local landscape actors who implement forest landscape restoration on the ground,” he says.
