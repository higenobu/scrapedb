1/6/2022,"Cole Hagan, 16, survived a brutal attack by his classmates that sent him to the ICU. Hagan, who hoped to play college football, is now undergoing intensive speech and physical therapy. His family filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against several classmates and their parents.  The family of a Texas teen who suffered a brutal attack at the hands of his teammates has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against several of his ""friends"" and their parents.  Cole Hagan, 16, was at a pool party in Lake Jackson, Texas on December 3 when a few of his peers from Brazoswood High School lured him outside where he was ambushed by another student, 17-year-old Reid Mitchell.  Mitchell was charged with aggravated assault, along with Logan Huber, 18, and Ayden Holland, 17, who are accused of luring Hagan outside to be assaulted.  Hagan, who returned home from the hospital just in time for Christmas with his family, is now in outpatient rehab at TIRR Memorial Hermann undergoing speech, physical, and occupational therapy, his family told Insider.  The Hagan family has filed a lawsuit against 16 individuals seeking an excess of $50 million in damages and naming several of Hagan's peers and their parents, who the lawsuit claims ""knew or should have known of the plan to attack Cole Hagan."" ""The Hagan family is going to pursue justice in this case,"" attorney Loren Klitsas told Insider. ""Their son Cole, a star football player, is permanently damaged, and they have no choice but to pursue the parties that are responsible for it. It's horrible."" Christopher Wylie said he has been a target for physical abuse since blowing the whistle on Facebook's giant data scandal in March. Wylie rocketed into the public consciousness and became involved in the Brexit debate in Britain, which he said made him vulnerable to attack. The suit accuses Mitchell of assault and Huber and Holland of the threat of bodily injury. The three have also been accused of making ""false and defamatory statements...injuring Plaintiff, Cole Hagan's reputation."" After giving their initial statements to police following the attack, Huber and Holland returned to the police station to change their stories, claiming the assault on Hagan was sparked by Hagan's behavior toward their female friends. Those claims have not been corroborated by police, nor was any evidence of them included in police affidavits, as Insider previously reported.  Huber's lawyer, Scott Brown, said he is confident his client will be proven innocent of claims in the Hagan family's lawsuit. ""We believe that, unfortunately, he was just an innocent pawn in all of this with no knowledge of exactly what was going to happen, the way that it happened,"" Brown told Insider.  Several students are also accused of the threat of bodily injury as the lawsuit claims they knew of the attack before it happened and did not stop it. One student is accused of sending photos of Hagan to Mitchell ""to commence the plan to brutally assault"" the unwitting teen. Others are accused of being aware of the attack before it occurred. The students and their families could not be reached for comment. ""It is shocking because this is a small town and these kids all know each other,"" the Hagan family's attorney Klitsas told Insider. ""They all hang out together, and that's why it's such a head-scratcher, that such a violent act could be done by this mob against a really nice kid."" The parents involved who have been accused of negligence are Robert Brandon Mitchell, Trista Wylde Huber, Thomas Holland, Wendi Holland, Hailey Vitek Rodd, Steven Rodd, Paul Cagle, Shelley Stroud, and Rodney Stroud. They could not be reached or did not respond to requests for comment. Read the original article on Insider",U.S./INSIDER,A Texas high school athlete was brutally beaten at a party with friends.

1/6/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Prosecutors urged the judge who presided over the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell on Wednesday to conduct an inquiry into a juror’s reported claims that he was a victim of sexual abuse. Maxwell, 60, was convicted last week of charges that she conspired to recruit and groom teenage girls to be sexually abused by the financier Jeffrey Epstein. In interviews published Wednesday by The Independen t and the Daily Mail, one juror in the case described a moment during the deliberations when he told fellow jurors that, like some of Epstein's victims, he had been sexually abused as a child. And he said he convinced other jurors that a victim's imperfect memory of sex abuse doesn't mean it didn't happen. “I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,” he said he told the jury, according to The Independent. ""But I can’t remember all the details, there are some things that run together."" In a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan, prosecutors said those reports “merit attention by the Court.” The juror was identified only by his first and middle name in the articles. Prosecutors suggested in their letter that Nathan schedule a hearing in about one month, along with a schedule for lawyers to file briefs regarding the applicable law and the scope of the hearing. “The Government respectfully submits that any juror investigation should be conducted exclusively under the supervision of the Court,” prosecutors wrote. If the judge decides to conduct a hearing, her staff should “promptly contact the juror to notify him” and inquire whether he would like a lawyer to be appointed in connection with it, prosecutors said. Potential jurors in Maxwell's case were asked to fill out a questionnaire asking: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” Quoting from the press reports, prosecutors said the juror asserted that he “flew through” the questionnaire and didn’t recall being asked if he’d been a victim of sex abuse. Defense lawyers did not immediately comment. Prosecutors said in their letter that they'd reached out to defense counsel on Tuesday night but they had not yet responded. Prosecutors said they were “not aware of the defense position on this issue.” Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019 as he awaited a sex trafficking trial. No sentencing date has been set after Maxwell's conviction and she is still facing trial on perjury charges.",U.S./Associated Press,Prosecutors alert Maxwell judge of juror's sex abuse claims,https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutors-alert-maxwell-judge-jurors-190608948.html
