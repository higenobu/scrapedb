4/16/2022,"The UN’s refugee agency has condemned Boris Johnson’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda as “a symbolic gesture” that will be unworkable in practice. Speaking to the Guardian, Gillian Triggs, the assistant high commissioner at the UNHCR, said the proposed arrangement would only accommodate a few hundred people a year, making it extremely expensive as well as illegal and discriminatory. Ministers insisted on Friday that the scheme would save money in the “longer term”, despite a reported cost of up to £30,000 per person. But government insiders said the expected torrent of legal battles could leave it costing substantially more, with some predicting it could take two years before anyone was flown to Rwanda. Home Office sources said they were braced for judicial reviews and a wave of immigration tribunals over the lawfulness of attempts to offshore asylum seekers who arrive after travelling across the Channel on small boats. There are two appeal stages for judicial reviews and three for those seeking to challenge their removal through an immigration tribunal, casting in more doubt Johnson’s stated aim of removing people to the central African country in the next six weeks. Home secretary Priti Patel signed a “ministerial direction” authorising the policy to be implemented despite an objection on spending grounds from her department’s permanent secretary. A Home Office source said the ministerial direction was issued because the savings made in the long-term by the new policy could “not be quantified with certainty” but that Patel did not want to let “a lack of precise modelling” hold the decision back. Downing Street has said it expects that thousands of asylum seekers will be relocated within the first few years of the scheme. Triggs accused the UK of “attempting to shift its burden to a developing country” and warned that the arrangement signed off by Patel “would not comply with the UK’s international legal responsibilities”, adding: “All the indications are that it will be unworkable.” Triggs continued: “We want to end the vulnerability of people on the move to people-trafficking and of course we want to stop people drowning, but we strongly disagree with victimising the very people who need protection. There should instead be an increase in legal pathways to the UK.” The proposals seemed designed to appeal to anti-migrant sentiment in the UK, she suggested. “We are a politically neutral, humanitarian body – it’s not really for me to comment on the politics,” Triggs said. “But we are in an environment in which populist governments will appeal to their rightwing, anti-migrant sentiment and this would presumably be part of that.” Two former Tory international development secretaries on Friday voiced their opposition to the policy, and cast doubt on whether the government would successfully fly anyone to Rwanda. Rory Stewart told the Guardian there was a “very strong possibility it’s complete pie in the sky” and had been “rushed out to distract people” from the prime minister being fined by police for attending a party in Downing Street that broke Covid laws. Stewart, a minister under Theresa May, said that when he was in government, it was hard enough to remove citizens of some countries back to their place of birth. “It’s a completely extraordinary thing to be doing and I think legal challenges will mean they won’t make it on to the planes,” he predicted. Stewart, who visited Rwanda earlier in the month, said it was “one of the very poorest countries on Earth” and a “particularly extreme environment into which to put people”. The Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell also said it was an impractical, immoral and incredibly expensive plan. “The costs are eye-watering,” he told the BBC. “You’re going to send people 6,000 miles into central Africa – it looked when it was discussed in parliament before that it would actually be cheaper to put each asylum seeker in the Ritz hotel in London.” Triggs also warned that the UK was introducing a discriminatory approach towards refugees, offering an uncapped scheme for asylum seekers from Ukraine and a “draconian” system for refugees from other countries. “At the political level, we are seeing levels of discrimination,” Triggs said. “We are deeply concerned that the processes appear to be discriminatory. One of the fundamental principles of international law is is non-discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnicity or nationality.” Triggs hoped the popular support for Britons to house Ukrainian refugees would encourage the government to rethink its proposals. She said: “We saw an outpouring of sympathy and generosity by the British people themselves. So we see this announcement as out of character with British values. We hope that the public response will help to ameliorate the negative aspects of this proposal with Rwanda.” Johnson was also sent a letter by 150 British organisations supporting refugees that warned the plan would “cause immense suffering” and “result in more, not fewer, dangerous journeys – leaving more people at risk of being trafficked”. The signatories, including the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, LGBT+ refugee advocates Rainbow Migration and HOPE not Hate, said Rwanda had “a poor record on human rights” and the most vulnerable people were set to “bear the brunt”. Future legislation will be needed to put the deal signed by home secretary in Rwanda earlier this week onto the UK’s statute book. Alf Dubs, a Labour peer who was a child refugee, told the Guardian he expected there would be “quite a battle about this” and the Bishop of Durham, who also sits in the House of Lords, has signalled his opposition to the policy, saying it is “wrong in so many ways”. Home Office minister Tom Pursglove defended the Rwanda initiative, saying it would “crush” the business model of people smugglers and lower the costs of housing all those that arrive in the UK illegally, which he said ran to £5m per day. He said on top of the £120m already committed to fund the scheme, “we will continue to make contributions to Rwanda as they process the cases, in a manner that is similar to the amount of money we are spending on this currently here in the UK”. Pursglove added: “But longer term, by getting this under control, it should help us to save money. “We are spending £5m per day accommodating individuals who are crossing in hotels. That is not sustainable and is not acceptable and we have to get that under control.”",News/UK news,UN refugee agency condemns Boris Johnson’s Rwanda asylum plan ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/un-refugee-agency-condemns-johnsons-rwanda-asylum-plan
4/16/2022,"Former White House aide Stephen Miller testified on Thursday to the House select committee investigating January 6 about whether Donald Trump encouraged his supporters to march on the Capitol, according to a source familiar with the matter. The virtual deposition, which lasted for roughly eight hours and was earlier reported by the New York Times, also touched on Miller’s role in the former president’s schemes to overturn the results of the 2020 election and return him to office, the source said. Miller was Trump’s top domestic policy adviser and chief speechwriter. His appearance made him the latest Trump White House official to speak to the select committee, a day after Trump White House counsels Pat Cipollone and Pat Philbin talked to the panel for the first time. House investigators asked Miller about the language in Trump’s speech at the rally that took place at the Ellipse on January 6, a speech that Miller helped draft, the source said. The select committee focused on the use of the word “we” throughout Trump’s speech, which it believes had the effect of encouraging the crowd to march to the Capitol in order to pressure Congress to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election win, the source said. Trump used the term repeatedly over the course of his 75-minute speech, including when he told his supporters “we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue … and we are going to the Capitol.” The remarks, House investigators reportedly believe, amounted to an effort by Trump to encourage his supporters to march from the Ellipse to the Capitol on a false pretense, in the hope that they would disrupt Congress from certifying Biden as president. That determination has come in part after the select committee reviewed Trump’s private schedule for that day, which showed there were no plans for the former president to join such a march, and that he was to be back to the White House, the source said. Proof of bad intention on the part of Trump could bolster the select committee’s claim in the filing that he engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States by seeking to obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means. Miller contested that characterization, and told the select committee the use of the word “we” in Trump’s remarks was not an effort to incite the crowd to storm the Capitol but a rhetorical tool used in political speeches for decades, the New York Times reported. The panel is in possession of the speech and several draft versions, the source said. Miller, who testified pursuant to a subpoena issued in November, helped draft the speech with two other Trump aides – Vince Haley and Ross Worthington – who have also been subpoenaed. The select committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Miller’s testimony. Over the course of the extended deposition, House investigators asked Miller about his role in a brazen scheme to pressure legislatures to send slates of pro-Trump electors to Congress on January 6 in battleground states actually won by Biden, the source said. The select committee also asked Miller about the former president’s claims about election fraud. Miller told the select committee that the election had been stolen, and raised several instances of the supposed fraud, the source said. Miller’s appearance was at times heated and adversarial, the source added. Miller invoked executive privilege to some questions concerning his conversations with Trump, and only testified in response to the subpoena and after protracted negotiations involving his lawyer.",News/US news,Ex-Trump aide Stephen Miller testifies to House January 6 panel for eight hours,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/stephen-miller-january-6-deposition-trump
4/16/2022,"“Labour is definitely due a comeback now,” said Wakefield market stall owner Mohammad Javed. After coming to the area from Pakistan aged 16, he has spent the last four decades observing life in the town centre from his busy high street spot. “I’ve seen the rise and fall of this town, I know the locals, and I’m telling you – the Tories have outstayed their welcome.” Javed said he was not as critical of the Conservatives as many of his customers and fellow stall owners, but that he would never consider voting for them after the local Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan was this week convicted of assaulting a 15-year-old boy in 2008. “It’s shocking and appalling,” Javed said. “Add to that the inhumane foreign policy – the announcement that asylum seekers will be sent to Rwanda for processing – and you’ve got a completely untrustworthy party.” Like many Wakefield residents, his feelings about the former MP are tied into an overall distrust and disillusionment with those in power. After Ahmad Khan’s resignation, the fight for the marginal red wall seat is on. It will be a significant test for the leadership of Keir Starmer, offering the possibility of the first Labour byelection win from the Tories in a decade, and a possible indication of the way the wind is blowing before May’s local elections. Tony Murray, a lifelong Labour voter who grew up in Wakefield, gave up his membership and voted Conservative when Jeremy Corbyn became party leader. Now he says he will be going back to Labour. “For me, Partygate did it,” he said. “I lost someone during the pandemic and I can’t abide the double standard the Tories have shown. I feel so let down.” Cliff and Lisa Wright share Murray’s frustration, but feel Labour would not be able to address the economic challenges the local area faces. “The town is in desperate need of change and regeneration. We think the Ahmad Khan news will definitely swing sentiment to the left, but personally we’ll be sticking with the Conservatives. Let’s not let one bad apple spoil the whole barrel.” Their daughter, Danielle Wright, who grew up in Wakefield and is a dentistry student at Newcastle University, strongly disagreed, citing Partygate and Priti Patel’s foreign policy as the main reasons. “The Tories made a mockery of the Covid rules. Those photos of Johnson and Co socialising in the middle of lockdown were a real knife in the back for the rest of us,” she said. “As for Patel and the Rwanda deal, how can she be so hypocritical as to introduce rules so harsh they would prevent her own family being in the UK?” Walking through Wakefield, it is clear this is a place trying to redefine itself after decades of post-industrial decline. Boarded-up pubs and social clubs jostle alongside brand new branches of H&M and Zara. Artisan food shops and boutiques are popping up amid dilapidated warehouses. Michael Graham, Labour councillor for Wakefield West, believes this tension presents a real opportunity for the area. “Wakefield has been without an MP for the best part of a year,” he said, as Ahmad Khan faced legal proceedings. “And in response, its people have pulled together. They want better for their town. “Following Ahmad Khan’s conviction, some serious questions have to be asked. And regarding the Rwanda plan, I’ve already had a handful of emails this morning from constituents describing the decision as ‘nonsensical and cruel’.” Labour held Wakefield from the 1930s until Khan’s victory in the 2019 general election and Graham believes the shift to the right happened because people were not feeling heard, but he is optimistic over Labour’s chances of byelection victory. Without Corbyn’s leadership and after Brexit, amid a cost of living crisis, he argues Wakefield is “very winnable”. “The cost of living crisis is a major issue for people in my constituency,” he said. “Token tax rebates aren’t enough. I went to the food bank yesterday and there were people there who had never set foot in a food bank and never thought they would have to. Wakefield deserves better.” Graham shared stories of constituents who have been in touch outraged over the “tone deaf” decisions Tories have made in recent weeks and months, and insists these decisions have left even the most ardent of lifelong Conservative voters undecided about which way to vote. In a quiet corner of the town centre, Howard and Linda Greensmith seem to sum up the mood in Wakefield: “This is a Labour town, filled with Labour people. On election day, everything is to play for.”",News/Politics,Wakefield’s disillusioned residents say it is time for political change,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/15/wakefields-disillusioned-residents-say-its-time-for-political-change
4/16/2022,"The bodies of women and girls have long been a battlefield in war. This week, the UN’s high representative on sexual violence in conflict, Pramila Patten, warned that reports of attacks in Ukraine were increasing exponentially, while Sima Bahous, executive director of UN Women, called for an independent investigation into sexual violence there. The brutal accounts of assaults by Russian troops have chilling echoes of wars elsewhere. According to the UN, there were heightened levels of conflict-related sexual violence last year. Rape is one of the most common atrocities in wartime, though in some wars it is particularly widespread and even systematic. The vulnerable – such as disabled people – are often targeted. And war puts women at increased risk even when they have fled the conflict zone, or when a conflict has ended. Ms Patten fears that a humanitarian crisis is turning into a trafficking crisis, and the UN refugee agency has urged the UK not to allow single men to host lone Ukrainian women following predatory approaches. Yet despite its prevalence, sexual violence is one of the least understood, reported and punished crimes in conflict. Stigma and fear – including of the reaction of their own families and communities – prevent victims from coming forward. Men and boys are attacked too and may be even more reluctant to disclose what has happened to them. Survivors know that their attackers are unlikely to suffer any consequences, while they must live with trauma, punitive social costs and often long-term damage to their health. The broader difficulties of pursuing perpetrators in what some have termed an “age of impunity” – so visible in Russia’s actions from Grozny to Aleppo – are well documented. But it is also true that rape has not been treated with the same gravity as other offences. It was not listed in the indictments for the Nuremberg trials, and the Tokyo tribunals never addressed the Chinese and Korean women forced into sexual slavery by Japanese troops. There was no justice for the estimated 2 million German women raped by Soviet soldiers after the country’s defeat. The hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi women held in rape camps by Pakistani troops in the 1971 war never saw their attackers punished. The 1949 Geneva conventions specify that “Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, enforced prostitution, or any form of indecent assault.” But it is only relatively recently that a fuller understanding of the crime has emerged, treating it not as the “spoils of war” or extension of an existing culture of sexual violence, but as a weapon used to terrify, dehumanise and even destroy the enemy. In the 1990s, the horror of the systematic rape of Bosnian women and Rwandan women led to the successful prosecution of rape as a crime against humanity and then as an act of genocide, at the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. But members of Islamic State have yet to be punished for systematic sexual violence towards Yazidi women. Prosecutions for rape in conflict remain extremely rare. As foreign secretary, William Hague launched a high-profile initiative to prevent sexual violence in war zones, but attention – and funding – ebbed after his departure. Liz Truss was right to renew the UK’s commitment. Experts have called for specialist training of lawyers and psychologists at all tribunals. The Global Survivors Fund, launched by Nobel peace laureates Dr Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, seeks to improve reparations. But above all, what is needed is the international will to address the issue, with increased financial and political backing for bodies such as the international criminal court, and a determination to prioritise tackling sexual violence.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on ending rape in war: endemic but largely unpunished | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-ending-in-war-endemic-but-largely-unpunished
