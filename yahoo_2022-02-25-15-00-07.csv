2/25/2022,"An entire garrison of 13 Ukrainian border guards was killed in the first day of fighting on the nation’s Snake Island after the soldiers refused to surrender to invading Russian forces, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy said in an address that the guards had attempted to protect the island, resisting demands from Russian forces to lay down their arms. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, posted audio to Facebook in which Russian forces can be heard telling the soldiers to surrender and “avoid bloodshed,” according to a translation by The Washington Post. The garrison refused and were all killed in an artillery strike. Zelenskyy said the 13 soldiers would be honored posthumously with the Hero of Ukraine award. Russia treacherously attacked our state in the morning, as Nazi Germany did in #2WW years. As of today, our countries are on different sides of world history. 🇷🇺 has embarked on a path of evil, but 🇺🇦 is defending itself & won't give up its freedom no matter what Moscow thinks. — Володимир Зеленський (@ZelenskyyUa) February 24, 2022 Snake Island, also known as Zmiinyi Island, is about 30 miles off the coast of Ukraine and is less than 42 acres. The Post noted that the island marks the edge of Ukraine’s territorial waters and serves as a strategic post in the Black Sea. Zelenskyy said at least 137 people have been killed in Ukraine since the beginning of Russia’s invasion and hundreds had been wounded. That tally was expected to climb as Russian forces closed in on the capital, Kyiv, and Zelenskyy said in his address that “the fate of the country depends fully on our army, security forces, all of our defenders.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/25/2022,"White supremacists hijacked an Asian American New York assemblywoman’s Zoom meeting, attacking participants with offensive language and images.

Yuh-Line Niou, a Taiwanese American politician representing Lower Manhattan, was hosting a virtual volunteer organizing event on Monday when the white supremacists appeared and disrupted their meeting, reported PIX11.

According to Niou, the offenders shared pornographic images, used racist language and shouted “white power” throughout the ordeal.

“There was [sic] antisemitic attacks, anti-Asian attacks, homophobic attacks,” the Democratic assemblymember was quoted as saying.

Niou, who is currently running for state senate against Sen. Brian Kavanagh, said the Zoom bombers showed “pornography that had racial epithets written on it.”

“They started to call me names, an ‘Asian ch*nk wh*re’ was the one that was loudly said,” she added.

Niou and her team were not able to record the incident as they were focused on kicking the trespassers out and maintaining control of the event. They have since reported the incident to Zoom.

Several participants of the Zoom later confirmed what happened. According to state assembly candidate Illapa Sairitupac, who was among those exposed to “explicit sexual language that implied sexual violence,” said, “No matter what your politics are, it is unacceptable to stoop this low.”

Sairitupac, a son of Indigenous Peruvian immigrants, further slammed the attack on Twitter by stating he was “outraged” by the “racism and sexism.”
 


The unprovoked attack of the female politician came amid the continued rise of violence against Asian-American women, including the recent killings of Michelle Go and Christina Yuna Lee.

Niou noted that virtual meetings hosted by politicians of color have recently become a frequent target of such “Zoom bombing.”

“I received a message from the people that help run [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’] events, and other lawmakers of color, and they say it happens almost every event that someone’s trying to hack in,” she said.

NextShark has reached out to Niou for further comment on the incident.

Last month, Niou was also targeted with racially charged comments from New York gubernatorial hopeful Derrick Gibson, who told her to “Go back to China” before challenging her to call him “a racist,” as NextShark previously reported.

In response to Gibson, Niou said, “You’re a racist.”
