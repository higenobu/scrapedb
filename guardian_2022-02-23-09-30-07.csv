2/23/2022,"Dominic Perrottet has sought legal advice over the decision to close down Sydney’s train network in the early hours of Monday, while issuing a stinging rebuke to his transport minister, saying he “should have been advised” about the shutdown before it occurred. The New South Wales premier insisted he still had confidence in David Elliott despite asking him to “reflect” on comments made on Tuesday, when the minister revealed he had gone to bed before a decision to close the rail network, which prompted widespread headaches for commuters.  “The minister will reflect on that and realise that all ministers are available 24/7,” Perrottet said. “That’s my expectation as premier. “My expectation is that ministers are immensely connected to the operational matters that are occurring within their portfolios.” On Tuesday Elliott said he had not been called by senior bureaucrats when they decided to shut the metropolitan train networkbut added he would probably not have answered had attempts been made to contact him. The minister also confirmed he had gone to sleep despite having an “inkling” a major disruption was on the way. Labor later brandished a text message in parliament that appeared to show he was aware of the potential for widespread disruption. Perrottet said he and the minister “should have been advised” and would investigate the role played in the decision by the Transport for NSW secretary Rob Sharp, the minister and senior officials in the shutdown. “There’s a breakdown in process here,” he said. “The technical legal issues are complex and I need to continue to get advice. I’ve sought advice and I’m working through it.” He said he was confident the decision made to stop trains “was the right one” – which was his first concern – and he was now turning his attention to why proper processes were not followed.

Perrottet also confirmed he had not yet seen the risk assessment on which the decision to scrap services was made.",News/Australia news,‘Ministers are available 24/7’: NSW premier rebukes David Elliott over Sydney train shutdown,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/sydney-trains-shutdown-nsw-premier-dominic-perrottet-rebuke-transport-minister-david-elliott
2/23/2022,"Ukraine’s president has called up the country’s reservists after Russia began moving troops into the country’s east, and warned that Ukraine could face a battle for its very existence. Volodymyr Zelenskiy ruled out a general mobilisation in an evening address to the nation. But the decision to bring reservists back into active duty was a further sign that Ukraine was bracing for a possible military clash with its neighbour.  Vladimir Putin said that Russia will support the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a larger war in the near future. For weeks Zelenskiy has urged calm, and a search for diplomatic solutions, even as western allies issued increasingly urgent warnings about Russian invasion plans. Now he has told his country it must “increase the readiness of the Ukrainian army for all possible changes in the operational situation”. He added: “We need to promptly replenish the Ukrainian army and other military formations.” Zelenskiy’s defiant speech came after the US said on Wednesday that the invasion it had forecast for weeks had finally begun. Zelenskiy said that Ukraine is a peaceful country, but its people would not stay quiet in the face of aggression. “If we remain silent today, we will disappear tomorrow. We have hard work ahead, every day, but we are read for it, with confidence in ourselves, our country and victory,” he said. Zelenskiy also said he had held a cross party meeting to propose a defence coalition government and announced the launch of an “economic patriotism” programme of tax breaks and other incentives to bolster a country battered by the threat of war. Ukraine is losing billions of dollars a month as Europe’s worst security crisis in decades has prompted many who are able to flee the capital, Kyiv, moving to other cities or out of the country entirely.

2/23/2022,"Some of the world’s greatest directors launched their careers with an idea, a few thousand pounds and some friends with spare time on their hands. Those same friends would often go on to make up the bulk of the audience. But Netflix is giving Britain’s next big thing a chance to show their debut feature to the single biggest viewership the world has ever amassed – and is giving them a seven-figure sum to make it.  An unknown director, producer or writer will be given £1.5m and a global launch on the streaming service, in an effort to discover a future generation of “bold, distinctive” UK storytellers. The scheme, to be announced on Wednesday, will allow the directors to make anything from crime thrillers and sci-fi to romance and comedy, driven by the principle that “daring” film-making can “drive commercial as well as critical success and can emerge from all backgrounds”. At least one project will be picked from six shortlisted film-makers, who will each have received £30,000 to develop their projects over a year, with intensive training from industry mentors. Netflix will accept applications from across the creative spectrum – theatre, TV, video gaming, online content, commercials, graphic novels, music promos and short films. The programme, titled Breakout, will be open to film-makers who have not yet made a feature but whose work has already attracted industry or public attention. One of the biggest challenges for any film-maker, particularly a first-time one, is raising money for their film. Hannah Perks, Netflix’s manager of UK films, said the £1.5m budget would allow them to focus on the creative side. “They’re not going to have to think about putting that financing together – and their film will be shown on Netflix globally. It’s every film-maker’s dream to have a global release.” Breakout will proactively encourage submissions from underrepresented groups to reflect the full range of voices in modern Britain. Perks singled out for praise productions such as His House, an acclaimed horror film about the plight of Sudanese refugees in a spooky council house, a debut feature by the British writer-director Remi Weekes, who had previously made shorts and commercials. She said: “Although it’s about new talent, it’s about people who are film creatives, but who might also have worked in advertising, music videos or photography, and who haven’t had a chance to make a feature film but who have ideas. It’s about giving them a really healthy budget to make something that can be on Netflix and hopefully kickstart their career as film-makers – especially British film-makers, making commercial films our audiences love. “We haven’t got as many British films as we’d like on the service. That’s a key reason why we’re doing this. We want to get more British film-makers, up-and-coming film-makers.” The programme is a collaboration with Creative UK, which supports the creative industries. Paul Ashton, its head of film and television, said: “Talent is everywhere but opportunity is not, and from our very first conversation it was clear that Netflix shared our desire to offer career-changing opportunities to film talent in the UK.” Netflix, which is streaming in more than 30 languages and 190 countries, is the UK’s the most popular streaming service, with an estimated 14 million subscribers at the end of last year. Last September it announced it would provide training opportunities on its UK-based productions, including Sex Education, The Witcher and Top Boy.",Arts/Film,Netflix offers £1.5m budget in search for new UK film-makers,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/netflix-breakout-search-for-new-uk-film-makers
2/23/2022,"Fraud and error are likely to have cost the UK government as much as £16bn across the Covid-19 emergency loan schemes, according to parliament’s spending watchdog, which described the losses as “unacceptable”. A report from the public accounts committee published on Wednesday said the Treasury should by the end of the year come up with estimates of fraud and error losses across the individual schemes and how much it intends to recover.  The government guaranteed or gave out loans worth £129bn to people and companies during the coronavirus pandemic to support them financially through lockdown restrictions. However, ministers were warned from the start that the speed of the schemes would open them up to fraud. Since then government agencies have found large-scale frauds across several parts of the system, ranging from the coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) for furloughed workers, the bounce back loan scheme (BBLS) for small companies, and the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) for mid-sized businesses. Reports from crime and bankruptcy agencies have shown some loans were used to fund gambling, luxuries and home improvements. Theodore Agnew dramatically quit his role as a Treasury minister in a speech in the House of Lords last month after criticising the lack of action to recover stolen money. Data from government departments’ annual reports suggested fraud and error losses of between £12.4bn and £20.1bn, with a central estimate of £15.7bn, the report said. The furlough scheme is estimated to have suffered the largest fraud and error losses of £5.3bn, followed by the BBLS where £4.9bn is thought to have been lost. The government has funded a “taxpayer protection taskforce” to chase fraud in the schemes including furlough run by HM Revenue and Customs, but anti-corruption experts are concerned that funding is inadequate to fight fraud in bounce back loans. The government will also have to write off £21bn in loans to people or businesses who will be unable to pay them back. Dame Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said the loans fraud was part of a pattern of repeated failings by the government. “Lack of preparedness and planning, combined with weaknesses in existing systems across government, have led to an unacceptable level of mistakes, waste, loss and openings for fraudsters which will all end up robbing current and future taxpayers of billions of pounds,” she said. Hillier added that the Treasury should continue to account specifically for Covid-19-related spending measures throughout their lives, rather than allowing the spending to be absorbed into individual budgets. All of the UK’s Covid-19 responses are expected to cost £370bn over as long as 20 years in the case of the cultural recovery fund, according to National Audit Office data. Some £260bn had been spent by September 2021. “Government must be held accountable in this way to all the future taxpayers who will be paying for this response,” Hillier said. “Crucially this must ensure lessons are learned for when the next big crisis hits – be it climate, health or financial.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “We reject the claims made in this report. No fraudulent payments have been written off and the taxpayer protection taskforce is expected to recover up to £1bn from fraudulent or incorrect payments. “Thanks to the speed and scale of our intervention, the economy is back to pre-pandemic levels and growing at the fastest rate in the G7. The cost of inaction could have had a catastrophic impact on jobs and livelihoods.”",News/World news,UK lost up to £16bn due to fraud and error in Covid loans schemes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/uk-lost-up-to-16bn-due-to-and-error-in-covid-loans-schemes
2/23/2022,"Primary school-aged children produce about four times fewer aerosol particles when breathing, speaking or singing compared with adults, which could help explain why they seem to be at lower risk of spreading Covid. Various studies have suggested that young children are about half as susceptible to catching Covid as adults, and, despite carrying a similar amount of virus in their noses and throats, appear to pass it to fewer people if they do become infected.  One possibility is that the size and shape of their lungs and respiratory tracts means they emit fewer tiny airborne droplets called aerosols as they breathe and speak. These particles can linger in the air, particularly in enclosed space such as classrooms, so fewer aerosols could mean other people are less likely to be infected if they also occupy those spaces. To investigate, Dr Mario Fleischer at Charité University Medicine Berlin, and colleagues recruited 16 healthy children aged eight to 10 and used a laser particle counter to measure how many aerosol-sized particles they emitted when breathing at rest, and during speaking, singing and shouting. The results, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, suggested that shouting produced the most particles, followed by singing, speaking and then breathing. However, particle emission rates and volumes for singing, speaking and breathing were around four times lower for children, compared with measurements taken from 15 adults. “More precisely, children emitted [particle rates and emissions] during speaking of the same order of magnitude as adults breathing, and while singing, they emitted similar [particle rates and volumes] to the adults while speaking,” Fleischer said. The amount of aerosols produced during shouting was more similar between adults and children, however. The authors also cautioned that there was considerable variation between individuals, and their results didn’t suggest attending schools or after-school clubs was without risk. “Especially in constellations with high vocal loudness, which are common in the everyday life of children and adolescents, the aerosol emission could be similar for different age groups, as the measurements for the shouting condition show,” said Fleischer. “On the other hand, singing and talking at volumes typical for children might be less restricted if the time frame is limited, like in common school and extracurricular settings.” He added that other factors, such as the number of children and the design of indoor ventilation, also mattered, and that further research was needed to inform any recommendations made to schools.",News/World news,"Children ‘breathe out fewer aerosols’, which may reduce Covid risk – study",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/children-breathe-out-fewer-aerosols-which-may-reduce-covid-risk-study
2/23/2022,"Thomas Tuchel says Romelu Lukaku was dropped from Chelsea’s 2-0 win against Lille in order to take him out of the firing line after a torrid afternoon at Crystal Palace in which he touched the ball only seven times. The club-record signing spent the entire evening on the bench as a lively Chelsea attack, spearheaded by the excellent Kai Havertz, helped Tuchel’s side to put one foot in the Champions League quarter-finals.  Lukaku was widely derided for his performance at Selhurst Park on Saturday and his head coach explained it was time for him to take a “step back” from the starting lineup. “[It was] not the moment, after the match where everybody was focused on the few touches he had, to put him right away into the next fire,” Tuchel said. “It was the moment to take a step back. That was the decision and you can clearly see we had a strong win. Almost every question is about Romelu. The focus is huge. There are nine other players that didn’t play and we should never forget it is a team sport.” Tuchel went on to say Lukaku, who he had explained was “a little exhausted” before the match, was not ready to play with the intensity required. “The focus today was on intensity, a high-speed game and also hard work on the ball and, off the ball, to have intense teamwork. Romelu struggled in the last games to deliver that. That’s what I meant when I said he was tired: not only physically tired but mentally tired.” Havertz opened the scoring with his seventh goal of the season, Christian Pulisic adding the second, and Tuchel said the forward had shown “immense” work rate. He did not know why Lukaku, who was not among the four used substitutes, did not warm down with his teammates after the game and said it was a matter for his fitness staff. Mateo Kovacic and Hakim Ziyech both departed during the second half with injuries and are doubts for the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday. Tuchel said he regretted not replacing Kovacic at half-time.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel defends ‘mentally tired’ Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/thomas-tuchel-defends-mentally-tired-chelsea-striker-romelu-lukaku
2/23/2022,"Stamford Bridge was a crisp, clear, boisterous place at kick-off in this last-16 first leg, the air crackling with a comforting midweek energy under those low white lights. And for the next 90 minutes two things happened. First up there was that unavoidable sense of wider turmoil. What a strange, fraught occasion this was for the world’s most guilelessly weaponised sport, another turn as the hot dog seller in the background of history, a bumbling tourist on the front line of world events.  At lunchtime Roman Abramovich’s name had been bandied about the houses of parliament, the British prime minister insisting (incorrectly, it was later withdrawn) that sanctions were already in operation against Chelsea’s owner. By late evening this had been translated through the lens of midweek football into a meeting of English and French champions in the Gazprom-sponsored Uefa Champions League, with an unavoidable sense of interlocking fingers entwined around this occasion. In the middle of which, as ever, a game of football broke out. Geopolitical tensions may come and go. But we will always have neat, tactically astute Chelsea Champions League knockout victories. And from a certain angle this was almost a parody of the form: clean sheet, set-piece goal, N’Golo Kanté breakaway, good hustle, nice patterns, Thomas Tuchel on his feet having an ongoing, deeply personal argument with his disobedient invisible twin. Chelsea were excellent in many ways, a team working in sync and offering by the end the clearest demonstration – in his absence – of what exactly is eating Romelu Lukaku. Tuchel lined up his team with seven essentially defensive outfield players here and a Pulisic-Ziyech-Havertz front three that did not so much scream goals as whisper it very quietly through the sleeve of a heavy woollen jumper. By 79 minutes he had used four subs, none of whom was Lukaku. Timo Werner was out there, wheeling around like a runaway shopping trolley. But Werner also works like a mad thing in deep areas. It took him eight minutes to make it to seven touches. Tuchel said after the game that he left Lukaku out because he was tired. What was most notable was how utterly out of kilter with the rest of this team he looks these days. Here Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz worked like Trojans in attack, running not just the channels but every channel, shuttling up and down the pitch utterly in tune with the collective effort. It was Havertz who made the difference early on, when he seemed to have a kind of invisibility cloak, penetrating the sovereign borders of the Lille six-yard box three times in quick succession. The last of these saw him force the corner from which he opened the scoring on eight minutes with a nicely timed run and a header. It is easy to forget how young he still is. In outline he has every attribute, from that compelling rangy stride, a footballer who looks as though he has strayed on to the pitch from some passing student charity half marathon, to the relentless ghosting movement. With 67 minutes gone he was back by his own corner flag, blocking off a forward run, hustling a Lille throw-in, doing deep, tactical, textural things. He is perfect for Tuchel, too. Chelsea’s manager wants control above all. Here he leapt up repeatedly, skinny ankles pounding the touchline, arms describing unknowable geometric shapes in the air. The thing that gets him most is failed turnovers, an inability to bite in at the right moment. And it was from there that the second goal came, made by the master of the creative turnover, and the game’s best player on the night. Kanté took the ball in the centre circle, saw a sliver of green and surged away, still so wonderfully light across the turf, then played the perfect pass at the perfect pace to Pulisic. His finish was expertly taken, garland to a fine, energetic performance. And that was pretty much that. There was time for Tuchel to have another tantrum on the touchline, hands thrashing at the air like a man being menaced by a swarm of crows. At that precise moment Chelsea were funnelling the ball about at the back, the game at a standstill. But Tuchel had seen lines, shadows, peril, misaligned objects. This is the level of precision he demands, the level of control freakery. Tuchel might have feigned mild surprise at those seven Lukaku touches against Crystal Palace but he sees all this stuff, just as he must also see his own inability to change that script, or to wring any more from this £90m asset. Leaving Lukaku out here was abrupt and to the point. Chelsea will surely march on from here, but it is hard to see how a performance so tight, so uniform in tone and texture leaves any space for that oddly misaligned record signing. These are the moments that clarify teams, seasons, relationships. This one does not look sustainable.",Sport/Football,Romelu Lukaku watches from the margins as Chelsea dismantle Lille | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/22/romelu-lukaku-watches-from-the-margins-as-chelsea-dismantle-lille
2/23/2022,"Countries should clamp down on the “aggressive” and “unethical” marketing of formula milk for babies, including forcing companies to sell products in plain packaging, a report by the World Health Organization and Unicef has said. In research, commissioned 41 years after the global health community drew up guidelines aimed at regulating the industry, experts found that the marketing of formula had “no limits” and had become more “unregulated and invasive” in the digital age.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director general, said it was clear the marketing was “unacceptably pervasive, misleading and aggressive”. He said: “Regulations on exploitative marketing must be urgently adopted and enforced to protect children’s health.” One measure the report suggests that governments explore is the standardised, plain packaging of formula products, a controversial proposal that will draw comparisons with tobacco marketing regulations in place in the UK since 2017. Dr Nigel Rollins, a paediatrician in the WHO’s department of maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, said that while nobody was equating formula milk with cigarettes, the way both products were marketed were “not dissimilar”. “The commonalities are there,” he said. “But instead of packaging being an opportunity for commercial marketing, it should be a place where public health can actually give accurate information to women. And if that type of information can be given clearly and honestly, then I think that’s a good thing.” In the report, Tedros and Henrietta Fore, Unicef’s executive director until last month, said that while formula milk “has its place for women and parents who are not able or do not want to breastfeed”, babies’ best possible source of nutrition was their mother’s milk. The message carries particular weight in developing countries where parents often do not have easy access to clean water or sufficient supplies of formula powder, which public health bodies say can result in milk that is potentially harmful and can lead to diarrhoea and malnutrition. The long-term benefits of breastfeeding, to both mother and child, applied “across the board”, said Rollins. The WHO advises that babies everywhere be exclusively breastfed for the first six months and are given breastmilk alongside solid food until they are two years old. The new research – which comes 41 years after a set of non-binding regulations known as the international code of marketing of breastmilk substitutes was passed by the World Health Assembly – surveyed 8,500 parents and pregnant women and 300 health workers in eight countries, including Britain, China, Nigeria and Bangladesh. It found that the $55bn (£40.5bn) formula-milk industry was sending “misleading, scientifically unsubstantiated” messages, many of which violated the 1981 code. Large numbers of health workers internationally had been approached by the industry to influence their recommendations to new mothers through promotional gifts, free samples, funding for research, paid meetings, events and conferences, and even commissions from sales, the research found. Formula-milk manufacturers often carried out “exploitative” practices known as “pain-point marketing”, which purport to present solutions to common infant problems, such as colic, reflux and broken sleep, it added. The collective effect of this marketing was that parents were making crucial choices based on wrong information, Rollins said. “Decisions on something as fundamental and as influential as infant feeding should be primarily based on the most accurate and truthful information and not information that is somehow linked with commercial interests and commercial gain,” he added. The report makes no formal WHO recommendations, but suggests how countries could act, from tougher legislation on the promotion of formula to greater investment in programmes to support breastfeeding, including paid parental-leave policies. It calls for governments to look at the possibility of banning health workers from accepting sponsorship from formula-milk companies, and forcing products to be sold in plain packaging. “Exploring the area of plain packaging is definitely an area that we’re looking [at] because it was an area brought up by the mothers [surveyed],” said Rollins. “Mothers said they found the packaging confusing, not clear, and they were left uncertain what to do, or what to choose, because of the messages on the package.” The idea of formula in plain packaging was mooted in the UK in a 2017 private member’s bill put forward by the Scottish National party MP Alison Thewliss, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on infant feeding. At the time, Vicky Fallon, now a lecturer in psychology at Liverpool University, wrote that while a marketing clampdown was welcome, this move made her feel “conflicted”. “The message this conveys to mothers is really concerning – that in terms of health risks, formula is somehow on a par with tobacco or more risky per se than alcohol or other products known to negatively impact health. “To enforce plain packaging on a product which is not inherently harmful is neither justifiable nor proportionate,” she wrote.",News/Global development,"‘Aggressive’ marketing of formula milk flouts code, warns WHO as it urges curbs ",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/aggressive-marketing-formula-milk-flouts-code-warns-who-tobacco-plain-packaging
