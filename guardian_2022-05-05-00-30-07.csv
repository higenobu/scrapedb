5/5/2022,"This week’s local government elections take place against the backdrop of a deepening cost of living crisis. Inflation is at its highest level in three decades, and the worst is yet to come. With wages struggling to keep pace with rising prices, living standards are being eroded fast. Throw in Partygate and the fact that it is mid-term for the current parliament, and all the conditions are in place for voters to give the government a proper kicking. The Conservatives expect to perform terribly, with good reason. Arguably, though, the elections matter just as much – if not more – for the opposition parties than they do for the Tories. They will be a test of whether the Liberal Democrats can win in suburbia and in the south-west of England, and whether the Green party can translate public concern about the climate emergency into votes. For Labour the stakes are even higher, because it needs to show it is on course to avoid a fifth successive general election defeat. The fact that the government is in such serious trouble puts added pressure on Keir Starmer to do well. There are reasons why Labour’s gains could be limited. The seats being fought were last contested in 2018, when the Tories did badly. Much of the action in England will be in London and the other metropolitan cities, which are already Labour strongholds. That said, in the past there has been a strong link between living standards and voting patterns. In the late 1970s, when Britain was also struggling with stagflation, the Tory opposition posted impressive byelection victories in what had been considered safe Labour seats and took control of the Greater London council. Margaret Thatcher’s victory at the 1979 general election was only partly due to the winter of discontent; the strikes followed a period in which the real level of wages had been squeezed by the Labour government’s pay policy. Many people in Britain are once again getting poorer, not because of a 1970s statutory incomes policy but because of a cocktail of factors: rising energy costs, dearer food, higher taxes, rising interest rates, less generous social security. Less than two months after delivering his underwhelming spring statement, Rishi Sunak, is under pressure to come up with yet another mini-budget to help struggling households make ends meet. The government’s problems are compounded by two other factors: it has been in power for 12 years, during which time which economic performance has been poor; and its support to the economy during the pandemic provided voters with the impression that there was nothing the state couldn’t do in an emergency provided it had the political will. Both factors should be helpful to Labour. To those who argue that Labour should be streets ahead in the opinion polls rather than enjoying modest single-digit leads, Starmer’s argument is that things look a lot better than they did when he took over as leader two years ago and that the path to victory at the next general election is a work in progress. This week’s elections will be a test of whether there is any substance to this claim. There is plenty of evidence that voters are fed up with the government; not so much that they are wildly enthusiastic about Labour. There is still time for Starmer to cut through with the public. There looks like being a second surge in energy prices in the autumn, which will mean the cost of living crisis will rumble on. Sunak may eventually filch Labour’s plan for a windfall tax on North Sea energy companies and that will allow Starmer both to say “we told you so” and rebut the claim that he lacks concrete policies. Rachel Reeves looks like a chancellor in waiting. Governments sometimes cling on to power in tough economic times. That was the case in 1992, an election that followed a deep recession in which unemployment reached three million and a record number of people had their homes repossessed. Voters were worried that Labour would put up their taxes and raise the cost of their mortgages. They didn’t trust Neil Kinnock with the economy, and it is possible that they will come to the same conclusion about Starmer. Like Kinnock, Starmer faces the difficulty of tacking back towards the centre without making the party seem dull. Labour tends to perform best when it makes people feel upbeat about the future, and the country could do with some sunny optimism right now. Equally, it is possible that economic factors don’t influence elections in the way they once did. Thatcher and Tony Blair were at their most popular when living standards were rising strongly but the old patterns may be breaking down in an era of culture wars. Given that people are being faced with the choice of whether to heat their homes or eat this looks improbable. The economy still matters a lot. So here’s the position. Britain has high inflation and may soon be in recession. A prolonged war in Ukraine means energy costs will remain high. The economy is riddled with structural weaknesses, from low productivity to creaking infrastructure. The Conservative party’s reputation for economic management and low taxation lies in tatters. Brexit, the issue that dominated the last election, is not going to swing the next one. The prime minister has been fined by Scotland Yard for breaking his own lockdown rules. In football this would be the equivalent of a striker standing two yards from goal with a foot on the ball and defenders nowhere in sight. Frankly, if Labour can’t smash the ball into the net now, then there is really only one question to ask: when on earth is it likely to do so?

5/5/2022,"The mayor of Mariupol says contact has been lost with Ukrainian troops holed up in the devastated port city’s Azovstal steelworks, as Russia steps up efforts to gain full control of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, which make up the eastern Donbas region, and secure a southern land corridor, via Mariupol, to occupied Crimea. Footage published on 3 May showed smoke raising from the steelworks: Footage from Lviv in the west showed the aftermath of what Ukraine said was a Russian cruise missile attack targeting electrical substations that cut off electricity to parts of the city. Russia’s defence ministry said it had disabled six railway stations in eastern Ukraine used to supply Ukrainian forces with western-made weapons, hit 40 Ukrainian military targets including four ammunition and arms depots, and fired two cruise missiles at military targets from a submarine in the Black Sea. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/5/2022,"Replacing 20% of the world’s beef consumption with microbial protein, such as Quorn, could halve the destruction of the planet’s forests over the next three decades, according to the latest analysis. The move would also halve emissions from the global food system, by reducing the razing of trees and the methane emissions from livestock. Previous studies have found meat alternatives have lower environmental footprints but this latest analysis is the first to assess what impact that could have in the world. Deforestation also devastates wildlife but is proving very difficult to stop. Experts say the best way is to cut demand for the products driving the destruction, such as replacing them with greener alternatives. Microbial protein is brewed in warm bioreactors, like beer, with the microbes fed sugar. The protein-rich product could taste and feel like meat, and be as nutritious, the researchers said. Today, 83% of farmland is used for livestock and their feed crops, but the meat and dairy produced accounts for only 18% of the calories consumed by humans. The production of ruminant meat – mostly beef, but also lamb and goat – has more than doubled since 1961, but a series of studies have shown meat-eating in rich nations must fall drastically to beat the climate crisis. “The food system is at the root of a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, with ruminant meat production being the single largest source,” said Dr Florian Humpenöder, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany who led the study. “The good news is that people do not need to be afraid they can eat only greens in the future. They can continue eating burgers and the like, it’s just that those burger patties will be produced in a different way.” The research focused on microbial meat as it had been produced at industrial scale for 20 years and was already available, said Dr Isabelle Weindl, also at PIK. “Even accounting for the sugar as feedstock, microbial protein requires much less agricultural land compared [with] ruminant meat.” Previous studies have shown the protein quality of microbial meat is equivalent to beef but it requires 90% less land and water and produces 80% less greenhouse gas emissions. The study, which was published in the journal Nature, used computer models that included middle-of-the-road projections of socioeconomic factors such as rising demand for beef, growing world population, increases in income and shifts in international trade. The 56% reduction in deforestation – 78m hectares (193m acres) – resulting from one-fifth of beef being replaced by microbial protein occurred in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Significant deforestation still occurred in the modelling due to the production of other foods, such as palm oil and cocoa. The researchers found the substitution of microbial protein largely cancelled out projected rises in demand for beef, meaning new areas of pasture did not need to be cut into forests. Increasing the proportion of beef replaced to more than 20% resulted in diminishing returns because much of the deforestation had already been prevented, with a 50% replacement leading to an 82% cut in deforestation by 2050. Microbial protein can be produced from a range of microorganisms, including bacteria, but the main source on the market today is produced from fungi, with the market leader being Quorn. “The best meat alternative is to eat less,” said Humpenöder. “But [microbial protein products] can make it easier for people to switch away from meat.” The study did not analyse the effect of plant-based alternatives to meat, but these would also be expected to significantly cut environmental impacts. Meat cultured in bioreactors from animal cells is still in early stages of development and was not included in the study because of a lack of suitable data. Dr Tilly Collins at Imperial College London, who was not part of the study team, said: “While the predictions of these models depend strongly on our ability to deliver such protein substitution, there is no doubt that the efficiency of biotech-enabled alternatives offers huge future potential for more sustainable food provision. “Governments and food production business need to coordinate to develop appropriate standards [for microbial protein] and thus future public confidence. Our nuggets may never be the same again.” The bioreactors used to create microbial protein require heating, and using high-carbon sources of electricity would offset part of their benefit, but green electricity is expanding quickly as costs continue to fall. Humpenöder said: “Microbial protein should not be seen as a silver bullet, but rather as a building block in a large transformation of the whole food and agricultural system, combining it with reductions in food waste, incentives to eat healthier, and de-incentivising the sale of products with high environmental impacts.”",News/Environment,Swapping 20% of beef for microbial protein ‘could halve deforestation’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/04/swapping-20-of-beef-for-quorn-could-halve-global-deforestation
5/5/2022,"You come at their Egyptian King, you best not miss. That’s a maxim that might be wiring back and forth through Gerónimo Rulli’s stunned noggin after he got up in Mohamed Salah’s grille last night, accusing the weak link in Liverpool’s attack of clanking him upside the head, even though it was his own teammate’s fault. Having given it the big one, it was probably then incumbent on the Villarreal keeper to make a couple of similarly sized saves to help his team to the Paris final of Coupe de Grande in three weeks’ time. But he didn’t, letting efforts by Fabinho and Luis Díaz go straight through the holes in his cartoon-hunk-of-cheese-influenced body, then with Sadio Mané in close attendance, deciding to nip off for the paper. Let’s hope he didn’t pick up a copy of L’Equipe, he’ll not like those player ratings one bit. That was supposed to be the uneventful tie, too. Should tonight’s reprise between Real Madrid and Manchester City take a similar leap forward in terms of drama and entertainment, it’s going to end 11-10 after extra time, and that’s before we get to penalties. The Fiver ventures to suggest that City are the superior side, but they should have been four up after 20 minutes of the first leg, and now look. So who knows? Real will surely feel less nervous at the Bernabéu. The home crowd will have their back; they got away with one last week; and the domestic title is already safely tucked away in their back pocket – a prize that saw Carlo Ancelotti become the first manager to complete the sextuplet of league titles in Spain, Italy, Germany, France and England plus not making a show of himself at Everton, the latter perhaps the most astonishing achievement of all. Ancelotti is also hoping to become the first manager to win Big Cup four times, surpassing the achievements of Bob Paisley and Zinedine Zidane. His opposite number tonight would simply like to join the triumvirate on three wins, a total he’d surely already have breezed past were it not for his tendency to overthink things. “We have to be better but at the same time we could play much worse and win and nobody can deny my assessment is right,” Pep Guardiola riddles-me-this. “There are moments when you train really badly before the game and then put in an exceptional performance, or you train really well and the guys do badly. I don’t know what’s going to happen. The selection will be to try to win the game.” Those last 10 words hang heavy. Oh dear.

5/5/2022,"Wayne Couzens deserves “decades in jail” but not a whole-life order, his barrister has told a court in the former police officer’s appeal against his prison sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. Jim Sturman QC, for Couzens, said the sentencing judge’s finding that the former police officer was not remorseful was “untenable”. But Tom Little QC, representing the Crown Prosecution Service, said Couzens’s offending was of the “utmost seriousness”, adding: “His criminality was, as found by the judge, a fundamental attack in reality on our democratic way of life.” Senior judges heard on Wednesday challenges or appeals to the prison sentences of five killers, including the whole-life terms of Couzens and the double murderer Ian Stewart. Emma Tustin and Thomas Hughes, who killed six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, are also having their sentences reviewed. The term handed to Jordan Monaghan, who murdered two of his children and his new partner, is also under review. A bearded Couzens, wearing a grey jumper, appeared by video link from HMP Frankland at the start of the hearing for his appeal against his whole-life term. The former police officer was handed a whole-life term last year for the rape and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard after he abducted her in south London on 3 March 2021. It was the first time the sentence had been imposed for a single murder of an adult not committed in the course of a terror attack. Sturman told the court of appeal: “Mr Couzens accepts that his crimes are abhorrent and nothing I say in any way is intended to minimise them or to minimise the impact of these crimes on Sarah Everard’s family and huge circle of friends.” He told the court that it was accepted that Couzens deserved “decades in jail” but argued a whole-life term was excessive. Sturman added: “The combination of his remorse and his guilty pleas … should balance out that aggravating factor which clearly exists, of him being a police officer, albeit off-duty in half uniform.” The barrister told the court that Couzens was unique out of the 64 people currently serving whole-life orders. He said in written submissions: “Whilst this may well be considered by the public and the court to be a case of equal seriousness to a political, religious, or ideological murder, it is not such an offence, not does it fall into any other category listed in the schedule.” Sturman later argued that police officers are not unique in being able to detain people, giving an example of a teacher able to detain vulnerable pupils. He concluded: “A lot of very unique and very horrible cases come before the court … but in our respectful submission, the court should think long and hard and step back from a whole-life order in this case.” Little, for the CPS and attorney general’s office (AGO), said of Couzens that “a whole-life order was a correct sentence to impose in this truly exceptional case”. “A police officer is in a uniquely powerful position,” Little said, with Couzens carrying out an arrest, alone, on one of London’s busiest roads during lockdown. Little said the sentencing judge had provided a “clear and coherent justification” for the sentence that he had imposed. “The judge was entitled to form the view that he did in relation to a lack of genuine contrition,” he added. Couzens, 49, formerly of Deal, Kent, and Ian Stewart, 61, previously of Royston, Hertfordshire, are attempting to appeal against their whole-life orders. Tustin, 32, previously of Solihull, and Monaghan, 30 at sentence and previously of Blackburn, will have their sentences challenged by the AGO as unduly lenient.

5/5/2022,"Critics of the government have seized on comments made by the environment secretary, George Eustice, who suggested people could help ease the cost of living crisis by buying value-brand food. Opponents pointed out that this would barely scratch the surface when energy bills have soared by 54% and the most vulnerable are already buying the cheapest foods. For many non-perishable lines, supermarkets offer several options, and these increasingly include an own-brand version and a cheaper value range. Financially, there can be a lot to be gained by moving down from a branded product to a supermarket own-brand, and more still by switching to its value range. But there are pros and cons of buying own-brand foods. And according to nutritionists, cheaper often does mean a drop in quality. Take a tin of baked beans bought at Sainsbury’s, for example. Online, the supermarket is charging £1 for a two-serving can of Heinz Beanz. Its Sainsbury’s own version retails at 35p and its Hubbard’s Foodstore line costs 21p. The tins may look directly comparable, but they are not: while Heinz’s weighs in at 415g, the other two weigh 400g each. But even when you strip out that difference, the cost saving is big: for Heinz, you are paying £2.41 a kg, for Hubbard’s you are paying 53p. Inside the tins, all is not equal either. In this instance, Heinz and Sainsbury’s both boast 51% beans, but the Hubbard’s tin contains 45%. That’s 212g from Heinz and 180g from Hubbard’s. For a product where the headline prices are more closely matched, the saving could be eaten into if you need to buy an extra pack to get what you actually need. However, the price difference is so great that in this instance you could buy two of the cheapest and still make a big saving. The other bits of the ingredients list are also worth comparing. Value products need to be bulked out somehow, and with beans the sauce will make up more of the mix to cut costs. A lot of the difference may be water – it’s the third ingredient in all of the products. Vinegar has been used by Heinz but skipped in both budget versions. At Morrisons, the best-known brand of rice pudding, Ambrosia, is on offer at two cans for £1.60, while the Morrisons Savers version is selling for 20p. Both have just 9% rice, but water features on the ingredients list of the cheaper product (second only to skimmed milk), while Ambrosia is 72% milk, and lists full-cream milk as its top ingredient. This means it has much more fat (4.4g a serving compared with 1.4g in the cheap line). In some cases, cheaper lines do better in taste tests than their better-known rivals. Which? has published a list of named brands that have been beaten by value ranges in its reviews – Lidl chocolate spread, Choco Nussa, is £1.09 for a 400g jar (27p per 100g) versus £2.90 for 350g of Nutella (83p per 100g) and was more highly rated by tasters. It also has less sugar and saturated fat in each serving. Another household favourite beaten by a budget version is Marmite – Which?’s taste testers scored it at 65%, but gave Aldi’s Mighty Yeast Extract 75%. The budget retailer charges £1.69 for 240g (70p a 100g), while Marmite typically costs £2.49 for 250g (£1 a 100g). Caroline Hind, a nutritionist at the Vitaminology, says some value versions of products “contain more sugar, processed oils and starchy fillers that are low in nutrients and terrible choices for people managing weight or at risk of diabetes”. Sugars can be difficult to detect, she says, when they are badged as syrups or given unfamiliar names. The latter is true for beans. The Hubbard’s version has glucose-fructose syrup, which some studies have suggested is worse for your liver than standard sugar.

5/5/2022,"For the first time, cities across Israel have scrapped fireworks displays that normally mark the country’s Independence Day out of consideration for military veterans and others with post-traumatic stress disorder. Parties and celebrations that begin on Wednesday evening in more than a dozen cities, including Tel Aviv, will not be accompanied by the cracks and bangs of fireworks. Israeli authorities in Jerusalem have opted instead for a silent pyrotechnic show. The move comes after increasingly vocal concerns from former soldiers, who say that the noisy festivities bring back the horrors of war. “After much thought and consideration, which also included a comprehensive survey, I decided that there will be no fireworks at Independence Day ceremonies this year,” the mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, said in a statement. “One of the things that shaped and influenced the decision were appeals from soldiers struggling with PTSD seeking to cancel the show, as well as full consideration for the people living with disabilities. I hope that next year we will find a suitable alternative.” “For most Israelis, fireworks are maybe a nice image in the sky, but for [veterans] it is the sound of gunfire and battle,” the Israeli culture minister, Hili Tropper, wrote in a Facebook post announcing that this year’s national ceremony in Jerusalem would proceed without fireworks. “They have fought enough. They have paid a heavy price. This year we are reaching out to them.” Currently, Jewish men and women in Israel must complete at least two years’ military service. The country has fought several wars since its creation 74 years ago, and occupied the Palestinian territories since 1967. According to Israeli defence ministry figures from 2020, about 5,000 former soldiers are recognised as having PTSD, although the actual number is believed to be much higher. The country was shaken this time last year when a 26-year-old veteran of the 2014 Gaza war suffering from PTSD set himself on fire near Tel Aviv, resulting in severe injuries. The incident prompted debate over the adequacy of support systems for wounded and psychologically ill soldiers. “Awareness of PTSD is growing among the public … There isn’t a single family who doesn’t know someone with PTSD,” said Prof Yair Bar-Haim, the acting director of the National Centre for Traumatic Stress and Resilience at Tel Aviv University. “More veterans are coming forward to talk about their difficulties than before. It’s a gradual process, but I think it’s becoming very clear to Israelis that people who experienced war should be accommodated and taken seriously. When you weigh the price the people we sent to war paid, versus 15 minutes of joy seeing fireworks in the sky, it’s an easy decision.” About 5% to 8% of Israel’s general population has been diagnosed with PTSD, comparable with rates in western countries, although the proportion with conflict-related psychological difficulties is higher, Bar-Haim said. In the occupied Palestinian territories, where data is patchier, one survey found 23.2% of Palestinian adolescents suffered from PTSD. Dr Samah Jabr, a leading psychiatrist in Ramallah, has argued that the diagnosis does not adequately describe the Palestinian experience of trauma, which she calls “repetitive and ongoing”.",News/World news,Israel scraps Independence Day fireworks after appeals from veterans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/04/israel-scraps-independence-day-fireworks-after-appeals-from-veterans
5/5/2022,"The UK has said it will ban the export of services including accountancy, consultancy and PR advice to Russia in the latest attempt to isolate the country’s economy after the invasion of Ukraine – but lawyers will still be able to service Russian clients. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, announced the “ban on services exports to Russia” in a press release on Wednesday. It is thought that the measures will not take effect for several weeks. Russian oligarchs, many of whom own significant assets in London and the UK, have in the past employed a vast array of British accountants, consultants and public relations advisers to carry out legally required reporting duties as well as lobbying and managing their reputations. The UK is one of the world’s leading providers of professional services such as accounting. The Foreign Office said British firms account for about 10% of Russian imports in accounting, management consultancy and PR advice. However, any ban would for the most part formalise an exodus by big professional services companies that was completed weeks ago. The “big four” accountants that dominate the sector globally – Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC – had by 7 March all announced they would exit Russia, while other services companies have ditched wealthy Russian clients in part because of concerns for their own reputations. Since well before the latest invasion of Ukraine there has been widespread support in parliament, including from Conservative party MPs, for measures to prevent London companies from being “enablers” to Russian companies that play an important role in supporting Vladimir Putin’s regime. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told parliament in March it was “shameful” that Russian companies could “launder their money and their reputations through our capital city”, pointing to “an industry of enablers”. However, it is understood that the measures will not affect the legal profession or other important services sectors such as software development and cloud services. That means law firms will be free to continue to serve Russian clients. In some cases lawyers may even be able to serve clients who are subject to sanctions under licences provided by the Treasury. Truss said: “Doing business with Putin’s regime is morally bankrupt and helps fund a war machine that is causing untold suffering across Ukraine. Cutting Russia’s access to British services will put more pressure on the Kremlin and ultimately help ensure Putin fails in Ukraine.” The government also announced new sanctions on Russian reporters whom it accused of “spreading disinformation in Russia, justifying Putin’s illegal invasion as a ‘special military operation’”. They included war correspondents for the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company and the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. Iain Wright, the managing director of the Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAEW), said: “Many of our individual members and member firms have already taken proactive steps to disengage as appropriate with Russia. ICAEW is confident that chartered accountants, whether in practice or in business, will be ready and willing to play the fullest possible role in making these further measures effective.”",News/Business,UK lawyers still able to work for Russian clients despite new services sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/uk-to-exclude-law-from-new-services-ban-to-russia-following-ukraine-war
5/5/2022,"The supreme court’s leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision protecting a woman’s right to an abortion in the US, is not official yet, but the ink might as well be dry. At best, Roe will be gutted to the point of near meaninglessness; it is very likely that come June, the ruling will be overturned entirely, allowing so-called “trigger laws” in 26 states to ban abortion as soon as possible. The US in 2022 will suddenly resemble the US in 1972, when a handful of states had legalized abortion and twomen sought out shadow networks of illegal providers – some dubious and dangerous, some not. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that as a conservative majority solidified on the court, and as Roe’s vulnerability became more clear, a handful of recent films have focused on the tense days just before legalization. Happening, the French director Audrey Diwan’s film based on Annie Ernaux’s memoir, is a spare, haunting portrait of a young woman’s search for an illegal abortion in 1960s France. (The film, which premiered at Sundance in January, is out in the UK and arrives in US cinemas this weekend.) Phyllis Nagy’s Call Jane, which also premiered at Sundance and will get a wide release in October, stars Elizabeth Banks as a late-60s suburban housewife who goes from patient to provider within the Jane Collective, a real underground abortion network in Chicago. The Janes, an HBO documentary recounting the history of the Jane Collective, will premiere in June, probably coinciding with the court’s final decision. Culture is not linear cause and effect, and it’s impossible to say how film and television portrayals of abortion play into this extreme regression. But they do offer an imperfect mirror to a culture in flux – one that, contrary to the court and state legislatures, has generally made slow progress toward depicting the reality of abortion, which for many women is safe, uncomplicated and free of shame. It is a great irony that as abortion on screen has become less sensationalized and more realistic, the off-screen landscape for reproductive healthcare in the US has grown more hostile and misaligned with public opinion. Take the burgeoning mini-genre of abortion road-trip movies – a handful of films from the last two years, disparate in tone but united on a woman’s right to choose, whose plots stem from the difficulties of obtaining reproductive healthcare in the US. Those films – Natalie Morales’s Plan B, Rachel Lee Goldenberg’s Unpregnant and Eliza Hittman’s Never Rarely Sometimes Always – were in part a response to a wave of state-level crackdowns on abortion access passed in 2019. All three – two buddy comedies and a somber drama – took their teenage protagonists’ decision to get an abortion or, in the case of Plan B, emergency contraception, as a given. Their drama hinges not on internal ambivalence but the real inane and cruel hurdles – age restrictions, hours of travel, money, so-called “crisis pregnancy centers” posing as medical care – to enacting her will. In contrast to past films, which have portrayed post-Roe abortion as more dangerous than it is, both the pre-Roe films and the abortion road-trip movies depict the procedure as clinical, careful and undramatic. Call Jane includes a real-time procedure whose steps are repeated; Nagy’s camera lingers over the metal instruments, the calm instructions of the providers, on several women’s faces in anxious, determined repose, emphasizing the procedure as precise, professional medical care. Director Alex Thompson’s 2019 comedy Saint Frances takes a similarly unsentimental approach to medication abortion, an increasingly common method for US women and one that barely reaches the screen. The procedure is unvarnished and straightforward: we witness Bridget (the film’s writer, Kelly O’Sullivan), a 34-year-old ending a surprise pregnancy, endure cramps and shed clotted blood over the course of an evening, then go about her life with all its other complications and contradictions. It’s worth noting that the anti-abortion movement has their own arsenal of personal stories and cinematic depictions, often in lockstep with the religious right and the Republican party. Unplanned, an anti-choice propaganda film, featured a gory portrayal of a 13-week-old fetus “twisting and fighting for its life”, as protagonist Abby says – a depiction numerous medical experts deemed inaccurate and misleading. The film spread through word-of-mouth, faith-based groups and sold out theaters across the US, grossing $19m domestically. The 2021 drama Roe v Wade, a much-delayed and beleaguered production by the siloed conservative Hollywood ecosystem, featured numerous rightwing celebrities including Jon Voight, Stacey Dash and Tomi Lahren. On the television front, the rise of streaming services and peak TV helped proliferate portrayals of abortion as mundane and unapologetic – an aspect of a character’s life rather than its defining trauma. Broadly speaking, abortion had been one of the last frontiers for television, enough that the New York Times’ Kate Aurthur referred to it in 2004 as “television’s most persistent taboo”. As Tanya Melendez outlined for Vox, abortion on television could, until the mid-2000s with very few exceptions, be classified into three major plot lines: a character considers terminating a pregnancy but doesn’t have to go through with it due to miscarriage or a false positive; the women’s decision is resolved by a presumed instinct for motherhood; and a “both sides” plot which pits a woman’s choice and those trying to stop her as equally understandable sides of a complicated moral debate. There were a few exceptions – a 2010 plot line from Friday Night Lights, for example, is a rare example of an adult helping a teenager navigate parental consent restrictions in Texas. But things didn’t change much until the 2010s, when Shonda Rhimes conquered network television and the rise of streamers fostered more opportunities for female creative talent and fewer content restrictions. On Rhimes’s Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal, main characters undergo abortion – clean, clinical – without emotional distress or asking for permission. Streaming saw the rise, in the 2010s, of what Jezebel termed the “chill abortion”. On shows such as Claws, Glow, Sex Education, Shrill, Dear White People, Euphoria, Jane the Virgin and Girls, abortion is a medical decision that doesn’t derail the character, and is but one of many events in her life. On the other side of the coin in the Trump era, Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale imagined a system of forced birth in the US – a dystopia that many awkwardly if not completely inaccurately likened to the Republican party’s assault on reproductive rights in the 2010s. Network TV appears to be catching up. A 2021 episode of NBC’s hit This Is Us framed an abortion as a teenager as a traumatic event that required healing, but because of a toxic relationship, not the abortion itself. The writer and executive producer KJ Steinberg told Entertainment Weekly she wanted the flashback storyline, which features scenes from before and after the procedure, “to reflect the seriousness of the decision without representing it as a life-defining trauma, because it’s not. The trauma was the abusive relationship.” This is not to say that abortion on screen reached accuracy just as access crumbled. According to a report by Abortion Onscreen, a project run by reproductive health researchers at the University of California at San Francisco, TV in 2021 continued to overrepresent white women receiving abortions (68% of portrayals; the majority of women in the US who get them are people of color) and underrepresent women who are already parents (14%, compared with 59% in real life.) Both TV and film have underplayed the restrictions many women, particularly poor women and people of color, faced in obtaining an abortion even with Roe on the books. Film and TV have undoubtedly shaped our collective understanding of abortion – there’s power in disclosure, in honest depiction, in busting taboos. But soft influence cannot, unfortunately, overturn a supreme court ruling. The latest mini-wave of abortion films looking to the past – Call Jane, Happening, The Janes – could once be seen as a warning, now as a window to a regressive future. We shall see how the devastating shock of that will suffuse the next mutation of abortion on screen.",Arts/Culture,Abortion on screen: how film and TV depictions have changed over time,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/04/how-film-tv-depictions-abortion-change
5/5/2022,"Once upon a time? What a tedious way to begin a story say the cast of this irresistible new show by Kneehigh founder Mike Shepherd, his first since the mighty Cornish theatre company disbanded last summer. Before it even kicks off, Calvino Nights has pyrotechnics and flag waving, music and dancing, with actors prowling through the crowd trying to swindle us. They are latterday versions of Crack, Crook and Hook, the crafty trio whose deceptions are recounted in the Italo Calvino collection of Italian folk tales that inspired the evening. “We’re robbers, we’re rogues, we’re thieves,” they chant roisterously. To make it clear: “We nick stuff!” In Shepherd’s show – co-directed with Elayce Ismail and co-written with Carl Grose, Anna Maria Murphy and Tim Dalling – it is as if the stories slowly bloom up among the cast, much like the set seems to have grown from the ground. Ladders are entwined with branches in a pyre decorated with weathered instruments and sculptures of animal heads. Inside it, a live band make merry. Any show staged at the open air, clifftop Minack has instant atmosphere – the backdrop is the Atlantic Ocean – but Calvino Nights fully utilises the setting. It’s theatre that sharpens the senses. You might expect one of the sea stories collected by Calvino to be prominent in the patchwork of the script but other elements dominate. The show’s fire master, Paka Johnson, wields burning instruments, orchestrates bursts of flames as a musical accompaniment and at one point sets the stage alight, underscoring Caitlin Kaur’s darkly wistful singing. Kaur plays The Wife Who Lived on Wind, whose habit of eating air appeals to a skinflint tycoon (Dalling in fine comic form). Calvino’s miser was a prince in Messina; here he becomes a preening gazillionaire with an Elon Musk-esque obsession with Mars. The story is combined with that of the mean soup-seller Mama Cook (the brilliant Bea Holland) who has a chickpea-sized son, leading to a rather protracted escapade about a rocket heist, but neatly making the point that miserliness and exploitation are not the preserve of the megarich. The show, like the folk tales collected by Calvino, also springs from a very real awareness of poverty. Mama Cook’s refusal to provide succour to a band of travellers gains pertinence from the way they emerge as if migrants from the ocean. Among the cast is Girum Bekele, a talented puppeteer and circus performer who arrived in Calais from Eritrea and joined the Good Chance ensemble in the “Jungle” refugee camp. This compassionate show wears its heart on its sleeve (and on Shepherd’s own chest: he sports a “make love not war” T-shirt). It also has a sharp sense of political outrage. The characters are on a search for their moral compasses – and they’re not alone, Shepherd observes. The morals of these stories could afford to be more understated but the stagecraft is often arresting. String and rod puppetry enriches the characters of Pete, Mama Cook and Calvino himself (also portrayed by Shepherd) and a huge puppet emerges at the climax, with wings made from twisted roots, her reproachful stare softening with a slight turn of the head. Lucy Seaber and Ruth Shepherd’s costumes include mix ’n’ match tracksuit tops and black kilts, which let the performers’ scratches and tattoos become part of the show’s aesthetic. The band, led by musical director Alex Lupo, strike up with the force of a crashing wave, and everyone on stage – including puppeteer Sarah Wright – is juggling a number of roles, if not flaming skittles as well. Presented by the Minack and imPossible Producing, it is a bounteous night that deserves a longer life. Calvino would surely have approved: his collection was inspired by the Tuscan proverb “The tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it.” This is nothing if not beautiful.  Calvino Nights is at the Minack theatre until 19 May. Then at the Lost Gardens of Heligan, from 27-29 May.",Arts/Stage,Calvino Nights review – irresistible theatre that sharpens the senses,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/04/calvino-nights-review-minack-theatre-porthcurno
5/5/2022,"Times like this, seemingly more than ever, call for that proverbial ray of sunshine, ie a holiday in the sun. But if you have a clutch of family members tagging along, especially impatient under-eights, you won’t want to drag them too far across the globe to find it. So the question, then, is where? If it were a mathematical equation, it would look something like this: Family holiday + all-year sunshine + bearable flight duration = happy smiles + lighter spirits + a healthy dose of vitamin D. If algebra isn’t your strong point, the answer is Tenerife – or its south-west coast to be specific. Temperatures here hover between 21C and 29C throughout the year, and the only blues you’ll encounter are those of the sky and the ocean; all at just four hours flying time from the UK. Adeje’s beaches are perfect for sunbathing, swimming and snorkelling Costa Adeje and the coastline of nearby Guia de Isora are the sunniest areas of the island. And it’s no coincidence that the 12-mile stretch between Playa de El Bobo and Alcalá is where most of the family attractions are based, including 15 sandy beaches. The picks of the bunch for families being Playa del Duque, Playa la Pinta and Playa de Fañabé. Golfers take note: there are two world-class courses here – the 27-hole Golf Costa Adeje and the spectacular Abama Golf, and green fees are substantially lower in summer than winter. Golf Costa Adeje offers 27 holes Away from those hallowed greens, a whale and dolphin watching excursion from Puerto Colón is a must-do. Pilot whales and bottlenose dolphins cruise the deep waters off the south-west coast, and close encounters with at least one species are almost guaranteed. A clutch of boat operators run three- or four-hour sails along the coastline, generally with food, drinks and a swimming stop included. Back on land, the south-west coast offers the best viewpoints for the Canary Islands’ renowned sunsets. Grab a bean bag on the rocks of Playa Paraiso at the uber-chilled Roca Negra Sunset Club and, while the offspring explore the rock pools, you can sip a cocktail in peace as the sky turns a glory of fiery red over the neighbouring island of La Gomera. Whale and dolphin watching trips leave from Puerto Colón And when it’s time to munch, almost all restaurants in the south are super family friendly; don’t be too alarmed if one of your brood is whisked up into the arms of an adoring member of staff in the middle of your mains. Many seafood eateries on the south-west coast offer the catch of the day delivered straight from the colourful boats bobbing in the sheltered village harbours of El Puertito, Alcalá and Playa San Juan. Alternatively, if you get a night off from the kids, book an ocean-view table at one of a dozen bayfront restaurants in pretty La Caleta – or, if you really feel like treating yourself, try the nearby Michelin-starred Restaurante El Rincón de Juan Carlos. Where to stayConveniently slap-bang in the middle of the island’s sunniest stretch lies the Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife, one of the best accommodation choices for families looking for luxury and liveliness. Its central location means it’s easy to get to most of the main points of interest. Siam Park and the excursion boats of Puerto Colón are within a 15-minute drive, as is the local hub Costa Adeje, while the dramatic cliffs of Los Gigantes are less than half an hour away, and Teide national park is 40 minutes by car. Sunsets on the south-west coast are spectacular The hotel’s striking pair of towers soar above the resort village of Playa Paraiso, offering an eyeful of ocean from balconies on all 15 floors. Some also overlook a white, lagoon-style pool area that features a DJ dock and live-music stage. For guests after an extra level of opulence, the Rock Royalty rooms and suites on the upper floors offer the ultimate upgrade in design and far-reaching views, plus access to a concierge service, a dedicated VIP reception desk and the exclusive Rock Royalty lounge. Across the hotel, rooms come with optional extras such as a Fender guitar and amplifier or a Crosley record player with a clutch of vinyls to set the mood. As you’ll gather, this is not a place where you need your kids to keep the decibels down. In fact, bouncing tunes are a constant wherever you roam, and making a bit of noise is all part of the fun – guitar lessons and DJ mixing sessions are just two of the music-themed activities offered to teens. Add in the kids clubs, Xboxes, F1 simulators, small cinema, sports facilities and laid-back vibe, and the Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife is as good as it gets for keeping you and your little rays of sunshine beaming under the island’s perennial blue skies. The Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife is family friendly, and the perfect place to make some noise And while the kids are at play, the adults can have their own fun, whether taking a yoga class, hitting the gym, joining a dance session or just chilling by one of the three sprawling pools. Then, when you’re ready for some downtime, there’s the sumptuous Rock Spa, an oasis of relaxation with indoor and outdoor pools, a sauna, Turkish baths, massages, wraps – and a snow cabin. Appropriately, it’s just the place to retune. With so much going on, the hotel’s restaurants and bars are great places to catch up with family and friends between activities. If healthy and organic floats your boat, a lunch of fresh fish and salads at the Beach Club could hit the spot. Meat lovers will make a beeline for Montauk with its impressive menu of steaks – rib-eye, sirloin or T-bone, all served with sides that include six-cheese macaroni and papas arrugadas (salt-baked Canaries baby potatoes). Elsewhere, Italian restaurant Capolavoro serves risottos, gnocchi, homemade pasta, and pizzas from cinque formaggi to boscaiola – with a specials pizza and pasta kids’ menu for younger diners. Narumi restaurant serves up a taste of Asia Or, for the taste of something completely different, try Narumi - Hard Rock Hotel Tenerife’s pan-Asian restaurant, where Japanese sashimi meets Vietnamese pho, red chicken curry meets pad thai and ramen. Sitting on Narumi’s terrace, a glass of sake in your hand, with a gentle Atlantic breeze wafting past and the setting sun casting vibrant hues across the sky, you could be forgiven for thinking it was the perfect end to a perfect day.

5/5/2022,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s £4.25bn bid for Chelsea has been “rejected out of hand” by the US bank overseeing the sale but he has not given up hope of buying the club, a spokesperson for his business Ineos has said. Ratcliffe made a late offer last Friday, two weeks after the deadline, but a consortium led by Todd Boehly were granted preferred bidder status and they are in a five-day exclusivity period, attempting to agree a deal with the club’s current owner, Roman Abramovich. “We’ve been rejected out of hand by Raine but we will keep reminding people we are still here,” Tom Crotty, a director at the British petrochemicals company Ineos, told Bloomberg. Ratcliffe signalled his seriousness by meeting the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust last weekend and a source close to Abramovich has cautioned against writing off Ratcliffe. “We will continue to engage with the fanbase,” said Crotty. “We see ourselves as a fan-based bid.” On Tuesday the sale was plunged into major doubt because of fears Abramovich is attempting to renege on his promise to write off his £1.6bn loan to the club. Ratcliffe, who offered to pay £2.5bn for Chelsea and pledged to invest £1.75bn over the next 10 years, is poised if talks with Boehly break down. Consortiums led by Sir Martin Broughton and Steve Pagliuca are also watching with interest after Boely’s group were selected ahead of theirs.

5/5/2022,"With Roe v Wade on the brink of defeat, following the leak of a supreme court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito and signed by four other conservative judges, the court’s views – and track record – on abortion are under extreme scrutiny. Here’s what the nine justices have actually said over the years about it. Roberts voted for abortion restrictions in two major cases: in 2007, to uphold a ban on what opponents call “partial-birth abortion”, and in dissent in 2016, when the court struck down Texas restrictions on abortion clinics. But when a virtually identical law from Louisiana came before the court in 2020, Roberts voted against it – and wrote the opinion striking it down, insisting the 2016 case “was wrongly decided” but that the question nevertheless was “whether to adhere to it” in deciding the 2020 case. Roberts’ views on when to break with court precedent could determine how far he is willing to go in the Mississippi case. At his 2005 confirmation hearing, he said overturning precedent “is a jolt to the legal system”, which depends in part on stability and evenhandedness. Merely thinking that an earlier case was wrongly decided is not enough to overturn it, he said – it requires looking “at these other factors, like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments”. Thomas has repeatedly called for Roe to be overturned, and voted to do so in 1992 when he was a dissenter in Planned Parenthood v Casey. In 2000, he wrote of Roe: “Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman’s exercise of control over her own body ends, depending on one’s view, human life or potential human life. Nothing in our federal constitution deprives the people of this country of the right to determine whether the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother. Although a state may permit abortion, nothing in the constitution dictates that a state must do so.” Breyer, who announced his retriement earlier this year and will be replaced by Ketanji Brown Jackson (whose own record “offers few clues” as to how she’ll lean on abortion cases), led the two supreme court majorities in defense of abortion rights, in 2000 and 2016, though he has acknowledged the controversy over abortion. Millions of Americans believe “that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child”, he has said, while millions of others “fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity”. Still, Breyer wrote, because the constitution guarantees “fundamental individual liberty”, and because it has to govern even when there are strong divisions in the country, “this court, in the course of a generation, has determined and then redetermined that the constitution offers basic protection to the woman’s right to choose.” Alito, who wrote the majority opinion in the leaked draft, has a long track record of opposing abortion rights. He voted to uphold every abortion law the supreme court has considered since his 2006 confirmation. Before, as a federal appeals court judge, he voted to uphold a series of Pennsylvania abortion restrictions, including requiring a woman to notify her spouse before obtaining an abortion. The supreme court ultimately struck down that notification rule in Casey and reaffirmed the abortion right in 1992 by a 5-4 vote. In 1985, while working for the Reagan administration, Alito wrote that the government should say publicly in a pending abortion case “that we disagree with Roe v Wade”. He also noted he was “particularly proud” of his work arguing “that the constitution does not protect a right to an abortion”. Sotomayor joined the court in 2009 with virtually no record on abortion issues, but has voted repeatedly in favor of abortion rights since then. Recently, when the court allowed Texas’s restrictive abortion law to take effect, Sotomayor accused her colleagues of burying “their heads in the sand”. Her displeasure with the court’s recent Texas ruling was evident at a virtual appearance she made. “I can’t change Texas’s law, but you can,” she said. Kagan also has repeatedly voted in favor of abortion rights in more than 11 years as a justice. She is also arguably the most consistent voice on the court arguing for the importance of adhering to precedents. She called Texas’s new abortion law “patently unconstitutional” and a “clear, and indeed undisputed, conflict with Roe and Casey”. Kagan had already grappled with the issue of abortion before becoming a justice. While working in the Clinton White House she was the co-author of a memo that urged the president for political reasons to support a late-term abortion ban proposed by Republicans in Congress, so long as it contained an exception for the health of the woman. Ultimately, George W Bush signed a similar late-term abortion ban without a health exception. The supreme court upheld it. Gorsuch has perhaps the shortest record on abortion among the nine justices. He was in the majority allowing Texas’s restrictive abortion law to take effect. In dissent in 2020, he would have upheld Louisiana’s abortion clinic restrictions. But Gorsuch insisted at his Senate confirmation hearing that he was concerned about procedural issues, not the subject matter. “I do not care if the case is about abortion or widgets or anything else,” he said. Trump named Kavanaugh to the supreme court shortly after he sided with the administration in a 2017 case involving abortion. He later dissented from the Louisiana decision, and voted to allow the new Texas law to take effect, though he has taken a less absolutist stance than some of his conservative colleagues. In the Louisiana case, for example, Kavanaugh wrote that more information was needed about how the state’s restrictions on clinics would affect doctors who provide abortions; and although he voted to allow the Texas law to go into effect, during oral arguments he appeared to have doubts about its novel structure and whether it would lead to a spate of copycat laws, both on abortion and other rights protected by the constitution. Barrett has a long record of personal opposition to abortion rights, co-authoring a 1998 law review article that said abortion is “always immoral”. Her one public vote on the supreme court concerning abortion was to allow the Texas “fetal heartbeat” law to take effect, though she joined Kavanaugh in raising skeptical questions about its structure. She also cast two votes as an appeals court judge to reconsider rulings that blocked Indiana abortion restrictions. In 2016, before Trump’s election victory, she spoke about how she thought abortion law might change if Trump had the chance to appoint justices. “Roe’s core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion – I don’t think that would change,” said Barrett, then a Notre Dame law professor. She said limits on what she called “very late-term abortions” and restrictions on abortion clinics would be more likely to be upheld.",News/Law,US supreme court justices on abortion – what they’ve said and how they’ve voted,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/04/how-supreme-court-justices-voted-abortion-alito-roberts-thomas-kavanaugh
5/5/2022,"‘Our beginning was a worm,” says John Outram. “It had light-sensitive cells at one end that later turned into eyes.” He is standing in the bathroom at the top of his house in London’s Connaught Square, explaining the symbolism of the patterns that line the walls of his shower.Three white worms wiggle their way across a background of blue mosaic tiles at the base of the cubicle, while a black I-shape floats against a band of red tiles above, denoting “the emergence of the ego”. A third yellow band at the top marks the realm of light, where the figure of “thought” appears between two triangles, signifying the parted halves of the “heap of history”. It’s a lot to digest before breakfast – and we haven’t even got on to the symbolic ceiling (the “raft of reason”) or the hexagonal serpent-skin floor tiles. “I stand here every morning to do my exercises,” says Outram, breaking into an infectious giggle. “A good dose of metaphysics sets one up for the day.” The eccentric architect has reason to be cheerful. At the age of 87, he is enjoying an unexpected wave of popularity. Having been stamped with the label of postmodernism – out of favour since the 1990s, when his work was described as “architectural terrorism” – he has been rediscovered by a new generation, thirsty for colour, pattern, ornament and fun. The last few years have seen several of his buildings listed, from the Isle of Dogs pumping station, that cartoonish temple to summer storms, to an opulent country house in Sussex built for the Tetra Pak billionaires Hans and Märit Rausing. Illustrations of Outram’s buildings can now be found emblazoned on T-shirts and mugs, while he has a growing following on Instagram, which he joined during lockdown, where he expounds his esoteric theories to a rapt audience. And now, for the first time, the full breadth of his maverick output has been brought together in a monograph. So how does it feel to be recognised so late in life, after years in the wilderness? “I call it being dug up,” he says with a chortle. “Disinterred, as it were. It’s quite entertaining.” As Geraint Franklin, the book’s author, observes, the English have never quite known what to do with Outram. His buildings are hi-tech, neoclassical and postmodern all at once, yet they fit neatly into none of these categories. His chubby columns house sophisticated mechanical systems for ventilation, wiring and drainage, while simultaneously alluding to ancient mythologies in their richly layered ornament. A huge jet engine fan in the pediment of the pumping station helps to cool the machinery inside, while also standing as the symbolic source of the “river of somatic time”. A pyramidal glass fireplace in the Egyptian-themed Sphinx Hill house in Oxfordshire summons momentous Pharaonic allusions, while cleverly sucking smoke beneath the floor to a hidden flue. In Outram’s world, embracing technology and modernity did not preclude the presence of poetry and history. While others of his generation, like Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Michael Hopkins, stripped their structures back, Outram piled it all on, mining inspiration from Sumerian, Egyptian, Chinese and Mayan cultures with magpie glee. While Rogers thought that “buildings of the future will be more like robots than temples”, Outram saw they could be both. But this wasn’t pomo, in his eyes at least. “I’ve always thought of myself as a modernist,” he says, “who rejected the injunction to be illiterate.” Ornament was a crime for most of his peers, but he revelled in architecture’s ability to tell stories, densely “scripting” his buildings’ surfaces with meaning – even if it was in a language that only he himself could understand. Born in Malaysia, where his army officer father was stationed, Outram’s outsider status owes something to his upbringing. His childhood saw spells in Burma and India, before he arrived at prep school in England at the age of 11, feeling like “a refugee from the British empire.” His early exposure to the vivid sights and sounds of South Asian cities informed his impression of the classical world, as being “much more like India than like the British Museum. Very noisy, very smelly, very colourful.” Step inside his Judge Business School in Cambridge, or Duncan Hall at Rice University, Houston, and you get a sense of what the dazzlingly painted Parthenon might have felt like. Outram’s interiors explode in a polychromatic riot, their striped columns supporting coloured entablatures, beneath vaulted ceilings that writhe with decoration. There are metaphorical rivers and symbolic rafts aplenty, but it doesn’t matter if you don’t know the code. “I put it all in,” Outram once said, “and you can do what you like with it.”The storyteller-architect would probably have been a writer if it wasn’t for his father, who forbade him from taking English at A-level. He insisted on physics and geography instead, both of which Outram failed. After his national service as a pilot, he entered London’s Regent Street Polytechnic in 1955, where he gained a technical grounding in architecture and the building trades, instilling a practical attitude he retained his entire career, that “the common way to build is likely to be the best way to build”. Unlike his hi-tech peers, his projects rarely exceeded the capabilities of the average builder. “The problem with hi-tech is that it’s very expensive, and the tech isn’t very high,” he says. “I’d been a pilot, so I knew what real hi-tech was – and it wasn’t suitable for architecture.” He completed his studies at the Architectural Association, winning his place with a camp rebuff to the macho new brutalism, in vogue at the time. Responding to a brief for a writing shed for a playwright, Outram designed an organic pod with a drawstring entrance to a fur-lined interior. It was a disarming use of unexpected materials that would become characteristic of his work. As Franklin writes, base materials are subject to an almost alchemical transformation in Outram’s hands. Humdrum concrete – which he once described as a “funereal porridge of muddy ashes” – could be transformed into “blitzcrete” with fragments of coloured brick, ground and polished to an edible nougat finish. It debuted at his New House for the Rausings in Wadhurst, Sussex, in 1986, where five types of crushed brick swirl across the facade like confetti in the wind. To commemorate the millennium, Outram was invited back to Wadhurst to add an outdoor dining veranda, for which he concocted his most elaborate column design yet. “It’s an ontogeny in architectural form,” he says, explaining how the design embodies the development of an organism from its earliest stages of life, just like his shower tiles. Raised on four stout legs, a base of blue concrete contains black marble “eggs”, from which an octagonal lotus of green blitzcrete emerges, marking “the amphibious stage”. It supports a ring of 12 rods, patterned with swirling bands of blue and white concrete, signifying the first cry of life, topped with a cylinder of translucent crystal and a capital of glossy black concrete – the pinnacle of “thought”. The columns look like candy-cane rockets, ready to blast the Rausings off to a parallel sugar-coated dimension. Conjuring bespoke fantasies for wealthy families and well-heeled universities was one thing, but Outram’s encounters with more commercial clients didn’t always bear fruit. One illuminating section in the book is devoted to his unrealised scheme for office developer Stuart Lipton in the City of London, which would have seen a palatial facade encrusted with glazed turquoise tiles, lacquered blue and red concrete cylinders, and friezes of cast glass, supported on columns of indigo blue, green granite and brick-red concrete. But the lettable floor area wasn’t big enough to pay for such a majestic envelope, so it was canned. Some saw his design as a Trojan horse to help secure permission for the wider Ludgate scheme – “a little ‘engine’ of a building,” Outram remarked, “that would tow the rent-rich freight cars through to planning permission”. His most fitting unrealised commission was for Battersea Power Station, which he was hired to transform into a wonderland of “shoppertainment” by Hong Kong developer Victor Hwang. “We planned to have holographic races around the ceiling,” Outram recalls, “and gigantic columns that would open up to reveal things inside, like a jazz band or marionettes.” Given what has happened around the power station since then, his psychedelic phantasmagoria may well have been preferable to seeing it choked with luxury flats. “They wanted me to bring Las Vegas to Wandsworth,” he says, the irrepressible giggle returning. “I ultimately resigned, but we had a lot of fun.” John Outram by Geraint Franklin is out now",Arts/Art and design,‘I’ve been dug up!’ – the dazzling rebirth of ‘architectural terrorist’ John Outram,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/04/dug-dazzling-rebirth-architectural-terrorist-john-outram-cartoon-mashup-blitzcrete
