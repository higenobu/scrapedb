12/28/2021,"Andy Beckett is right to warn that fears of overcrowding could stoke xenophobia and racism (The myth of an overcrowded Britain suits our island psyche – and this government, 23 December). But it isn’t just “some environmentalists” and countryside lovers who know there is a problem. We live far beyond our island’s capacity to support us. The UK imports around a third of its food; bad for a heavily indebted country that has turned its back on free trade in an unstable world. England is one of Europe’s most densely populated countries, and parts are buckling ecologically. The water environment is desperately stressed in areas with the highest growth. Biodiversity suffers from habitat fragmentation, pollution and disturbance as we expand our urban footprint. Our addiction to car-dependent sprawl is destroying landscapes that contribute to our wellbeing and our food.  If the population boom really has ended, that’s good news for the environment, but real benefit would need a huge decline. Nostalgia for a “full” country? No.Jon ReedsAlston, Cumbria  Andy Beckett argues that overcrowded Britain is a myth. Perhaps, however, he is using the wrong criteria to judge the question. I believe that we are overcrowded if we do not have enough infrastructure to support the population. The questions he should have asked include whether we have enough decent housing, enough NHS facilities, a good enough transport network, good enough wastewater disposal facilities, and the ability to produce most of our own food requirement. Looked at on this basis, it seems pretty clear that we are overcrowded.Graham GoddardLlanelli, Dyfed  Perhaps Andy Beckett should reassess his definition of “full”. Rather than look at how many people are physically in the country, we should define “full” as how many of them actually have somewhere to live, as was highlighted by this report.Alan GentCheshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/28/2021,"Matthew Belmonte is correct in decrying the autism label, but he does not go far enough: it can be a very serious handicap to be so labelled (Letters, 21 December). Advancement in employment is generally easiest for people who are team players with interpersonal skills. When I discovered my own autistic traits 20 years ago, initially through identifying with Liane Holliday Willey’s book Pretending to be Normal, I soon realised that my 38-year career to that date had been critically dependent on cognitively superimposing neurotypical layers over my behaviour as far as possible.  Undoubtedly, formal diagnosis is the only way that support and care can be considered for those who really need it; for the rest of us, “pretending to be normal” is a far better option. Consciously focusing on the strengths of your autistic traits, such as concentration on detail, can yield competitive advantages if you look for them. The effort involved in understanding and aping social interaction can be extremely stressful, however.Bob SeymourOgmore-by-Sea, Vale of Glamorgan  The notion that the “label” of autism should be reserved for “those who need it most” is at best misguided and at worst ignorant, and arguably dangerous, for autistic individuals such as myself. On the surface, I may seem “high functioning” – an outdated and misleading descriptor. An acquaintance is likely to perceive me as quiet, intelligent and perhaps slightly odd, but not disabled. To them, I am not someone who “really needs” my diagnosis. What they do not know is how I struggle with work; at present, I cannot hold on to even the most simple jobs because I find the environment and the social expectations overwhelming. Much of adult life makes no sense to me. Yet I went to university. I have a master’s degree. Does this mean I am not autistic enough to need the label? Those who receive the label of autism are already those who really need it, and to suggest otherwise is a step backwards.Name and address supplied  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Since many of the countless victims were students, it is appropriate for universities elsewhere to ensure that their bravery and martyrdom is not eradicated from history. University student unions in the UK, not least at those institutions with many Chinese students, should keep their memory alive by renaming their building or part of it. This is what several did following the murder by the authorities of the black South African anti-apartheid student activist Steve Biko. The Steve Biko Bar at Bradford University closed in 2005 but the student union building at Manchester University (which has the largest student union in the UK) is still named after him.

12/28/2021,"England will have no further Covid restrictions over New Year’s Eve, Boris Johnson has ruled, meaning nightclubs and mass events can continue but people will be urged to test before seeing those who are vulnerable. After a virtual briefing with England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, No 10 said the data would continue to be reviewed but that no new steps would be taken before the new year.  The decision makes England an outlier in the UK, after Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put limits on social gatherings and mass events. Instead, Johnson and the health secretary, Sajid Javid, will put an emphasis on personal responsibility, despite warnings from health bosses and trade unions, stressing the needs to wear masks indoors, keep areas ventilated and to take tests before seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives. Before Christmas, Johnson’s cabinet pushed back against new curbs, with key opponents including the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. Three cabinet ministers who spoke to the Guardian on Monday said they remained sceptical any further measures were necessary. New coronavirus restrictions came into force from Monday in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. From Boxing Day, Wales restricted to a maximum of six the number of people allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants, as well as other restrictions on numbers for larger events. Nightclubs have been closed. In Scotland, up to three households can meet, with one-metre distancing between groups at indoor and outdoor venues such as bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and gyms. Table service is also required at places where alcohol is served and nightclubs are to close for at least three weeks from 27 December. Northern Ireland is also recommending restricting socialising to three households, while up to six people can meet in pubs, bars and restaurants. Nightclubs have also been closed there.",News/World news,"No new Covid restrictions in England before new year, Boris Johnson says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/27/boris-johnson-will-impose-no-further-covid-restrictions-before-new-year
12/28/2021,"England could fit an air purifier to every classroom for half the price of the new royal yacht, a move which scientists and campaigners say would significantly reduce the spread of Covid in schools. The move would cost about £140m, according to calculations by the Liberal Democrats. Government sources have said there will be no delay to the start of the school term, despite surging Omicron cases, and that any additional restrictions will not include classroom closures.  Schools, however, have said high numbers of teacher absences as a result of self-isolation could mean they are forced to send whole year groups home. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has called on retired teachers and those who have left the profession to help fill the gaps. The general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, told the Telegraph that classroom closures could occur if schools had no alternative. “If you have a fixed pool available of those who can teach young people, then the only final resort schools and colleges have is to start thinking about the certain year groups that should be prioritised in the short term,” he said. Government guidance suggests teachers should open external windows and internal doors to improve natural ventilation and schools “should balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature”. Opening windows is likely to be more difficult when schools return in cold January temperatures. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said the government’s advice to use CO2 monitors was less effective because they give information on where more airflow is needed but do not affect the flow itself. Headteachers have also criticised the cost of the government’s preferred supplier for air filters – one of the units, made by Camfil City M, costs £1,170 and a Dyson model costs £424.82. Wilson said schools should not be paying for the units at all. “Failure to act right now will fail our children in the future. The government has a week to solve this, otherwise pupils will be left out in the cold and missing out on vital learning once again,” she said. “Nadhim Zahawi gave a cast-iron guarantee that schools would stay open. Unless he gets a grip on this quickly, he will be adding to the countless broken promises from this Government. Worse still, he will be breaking a promise to all our children.” The German government invested £452m in October 2020 in improving ventilation systems in public buildings, including schools, including upgrading air conditioning systems and air purifiers, described by the then-chancellor Angela Merkel as “one of the cheapest and most effective ways” of tackling Covid spread. New York City has also undertaken extensive ventilation surveys and distributed about 100,000 high efficiency particulate air (Hepa) purifiers.",News/Education,England could fit Covid air filters to all classrooms for half cost of royal yacht,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/27/covid-air-filters-for-all-classrooms-in-england-would-cost-half-of-royal-yacht
12/28/2021,"At university we were given a task to explain how the readings we did that week on sexual coercion in the education system were applicable to the contexts we came from. A woman from a low income country went first, and described how “virginity testing” (where fingers are used to test if the hymen is still intact) was part of childhood schooling in her country. It was my turn directly after and I was slightly lost for words. “Uhh … I grew up in a privileged area of Australia so nothing like that happened to me in my schooling … but when I was doing the readings on sexual coercion, I realised I and people I knew experienced the behaviour described pretty much every weekend.”  I was met with shock from the rest of the members of the group as I described the ways in which sexual coercion was a fundamental part of being a teenager in Australia. It was hard to comprehend for these people from all parts of the world that this could possibly occur. How could Australia let this happen? It’s such a “developed” country! This and two other pivotal conversations spurred me to ask my Instagram following if they or anyone close to them had been sexually assaulted by someone who went to an all-boys school in Sydney. Over weeks this turned into a national campaign demanding consent education with more than 45,000 signatures. It’s shocking to learn that Australia’s norm is riddled with human rights violations and gender-based violence. It hides under a big banner that screams “Australia is a safe and happy place” but our attitudes toward gender and sexuality have created power imbalances, taboos and widespread violence. I now look back on 2021 and think about the year that Australia said we want better. I admire the more than 6,700 people who named the school that their perpetrator of sexual assault went to. I remember every time a headline emerged about allegations involving people in the highest ranks of our country. I’m grateful that Brittany Higgins had the courage to come forward with her allegation that she was raped inside our very own Parliament House, which triggered the Jenkins report. I’m thankful Grace Tame used her platform to advocate for victims of child abuse in every way feasible. And I reflect in awe about the students across Australia who protested, shared petitions, walked out, stood up, and spoke out. All of this has meant that 2021 will be remembered for some big wins. After decades of women demanding so, and the tireless work of Saxon Mullins, an affirmative model of consent has been passed in New South Wales, and Victoria may soon follow. This reform is groundbreaking beyond the courtroom, because we stop assuming that the default access to a body is a yes, and that “only no means no”, and instead teach the community that without enthusiasm, sex is assault. In NSW parliament, a debate received unanimous, cross-party support for earlier and holistic consent education. It was triggered by 20,000 ordinary citizens who demanded it occurr. Then there were an estimated 110,000 people who attended March 4 Justice rallies nationally, which will go down in history as the biggest uprising against the treatment of women that Australia has seen to date. Outside the public sphere, in a time of reflection, myriads of conversations were held across Australia this year, and incrementally each one has contributed to nurturing a new Australia. This has not come without challenges. For many Australians this year, sexual assault dominating discourse has meant they have had to relive their own experiences, reveal personal details to people around them, or hear heartbreaking stories about loved ones. For some, it’s been a year where behaviours that have seemed normal in the past were suddenly branded as acts of violence. This is something I can say from experience is both confronting and empowering. For too many, these conversations involved finding out that people around them have opinions which have made them feel unsafe and unsupported. Yet, we still did it. We leveraged the work of human rights activists and feminists for generations before us so that those after us can do the same. This year, Australia learned that it can no longer plead ignorance. We have a problem, and it’s a gendered one. Experts have solutions, youth have opinions. Listen to them. I’ve read many news articles this year about Grace, Brittany and myself. While it has been an honour to be in their company in this way, I hope 2022 is the year where we better include and elevate the voices of traditionally marginalised groups of society. This is the only way we can truly turn Australia into a safe and happy place for all. Young Australians don’t care about taboos and we don’t care about expectations. We are making it clear that we want better in 2022 and we will keep marching, keep signing, keep walking out, and keep speaking up until we get it. Listen to us.

12/28/2021,"It’s been a huge political year, dominated again by the Covid-19 pandemic, and a federal election is just around the corner. Scott Morrison will want to go into that contest trumpeting the government’s achievements. But substantial items remain on the prime minister’s to-do list. Here is a selection of unfinished business.  It feels like a lifetime ago but a $17.7bn aged care package was the centrepiece of the May budget. That package was the government’s response to the damning findings of the aged care royal commission. Morrison and the health minister, Greg Hunt, adopted a great many, but not all, of the recommendations from the inquiry. One of the central measures was an extra $7.5bn allocated for home care, including $6.5bn to clear the waiting list of an estimated 80,000 people over the next two years, and about $800m to support 1.6 million informal carers, including respite services for 8,400 Australians. The government promised to allocate 40,000 additional home care packages in 2021-22 and the same in 2022-23. In early December the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, released new quarterly data tracking progress. By the end of September, 10,000 additional places had been released. But as of 30 September, 74,143 people were still waiting for their home care package at their approved level. If you want to fix aged care, you need a workforce strategy. The Grattan Institute noted in December the government had “no clear plan to meet future workforce requirements” and “home care staff are underpaid for what they do”. In a report titled Unfinished Business: Practical Policies For Better Care At Home, the thinktank said 58,000 more carers would be needed just to meet the planned increase in home care places. “To attract and retain home care workers, they should get better pay and conditions,” the report said. The aged care royal commission recommended low wages be increased. The government “noted” that recommendation rather than supporting it. Back in June 2018, the then minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, convinced her cabinet colleagues to fund a new national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces by the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins. In March 2020, Jenkins handed down 55 recommendations, including a proposal for employers to face an obligation to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. When the government responded formally to the recommendations in April, it balked at the central proposal, saying it would assess whether the proposed positive duty may “create further complexity, uncertainty or duplication in the overarching legal framework”. In July Jenkins chided the government again on the positive duty, reminding it the problem in workplaces was much larger than “a few bad blokes”. But the central recommendation was omitted from the legislative reform package passed by parliament in late August. The government said it would continue to mull over the proposition. Equivocation about the key recommendation happened in the middle of the furore over the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins’ allegation of sexual assault, the historic rape allegation against frontbencher Christian Porter, which he stridently denies, staff members sharing lewd pictures in Parliament House, and complaints about the online behaviour (not sexual) of Liberal National MP Andrew Laming towards two female constituents. The legislation omitting the positive duty was also passed immediately before the government’s National Summit on Women’s Safety – prompting the Australian of the Year, sexual assault survivor Grace Tame, to blast the government’s “clear pattern of denial, minimisation, ultimately dismissal of women’s issues”. Higgins’ allegation of sexual assault triggered a reckoning inside federal politics. Jenkins was asked by the government to review parliament’s toxic workplace culture, and her insights about the prevalence of sexual harassment and bullying were bracing to say the least. Jenkins recommended a number of structural and cultural changes, including more normalised human resources processes for parliamentary staff. The report landed on 30 November. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, says the first two recommendations will be implemented early next year, with changes to the workplace framework legislated before the election. We’ll see if that happens. That would be progress, but it would leave the bulk of the systemic changes to be implemented post-election. The Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, signalled repeatedly during this term that he wanted to legislate a national voice to parliament. But the process has moved slowly. The government has also balked at enshrining the voice in the constitution, first proposed in the Uluru statement from the heart in 2017. The Uluru statement recommended a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, a Makarrata or truth-telling commission and an eventual treaty between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Just before Christmas Wyatt took the first steps towards a legislated option. Cabinet approved the establishment of 35 regional and local representative groups. Morrison said in August: “Some might want this process to be faster. I want it to be right.” After a climate policy pivot spanning the best part of 12 months, and a torturous five-minutes-to-midnight negotiation with the Nationals, Morrison managed to land a new commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. But the policy underpinning the putative transition was entirely underwhelming. The prime minister also did not manage to persuade colleagues to increase the ambition of Australia’s current 2030 target. The Nationals vetoed that. Morrison will hope the government’s 2050 commitment is sufficient to shore up Liberals under electoral pressure from climate-focused independents in the coming election, but not ambitious enough to cause the Coalition political trouble in regional Queensland. In any case, the story is not over. Morrison will continue to face pressure to do more. Some Liberals are already pushing for a more ambitious target for 2035. Australia also agreed at the end of the Cop26 in Glasgow to re-examine our 2030 target by the end of next year. We all saw the big announcement – Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and “that fella from down under” unveiling a trilateral security partnership called Aukus. Eight planned nuclear submarines, the first of them unlikely to be in the water until about 2040, and 18 months before we determine precisely how to proceed. Aukus at the substantive level is a plan for a plan. Cost? Unknown, although the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says it could be as high as $171bn. When he signed up for Aukus, Morrison cancelled a $90bn contract with the French-owned Naval Group. Emmanuel Macron retaliated with a mic drop moment on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in November, branding Australia’s prime minister a liar. The former prime minister Paul Keating, concerned about a loss of strategic autonomy, delivered his verdict at the National Press Club. “Eight submarines against China when we get the submarines in 20 years’ time – it’ll be like throwing a handful of toothpicks at the mountain.” It’s long forgotten now, but on 13 December 2018, Morrison said he would proceed with two reforms – a religious discrimination bill (more of that shortly) and a federal integrity commission. The government had begun work to convert the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity into an anti-corruption body before Malcolm Turnbull lost the leadership. Morrison (who had once dismissed a federal body as a “fringe issue”) said in December 2018 the proposed commonwealth integrity commission would have a public sector division and a law enforcement division. He said his federal model would “avoid the serious failings of state-based integrity bodies that on too many occasions have proved to be kangaroo courts falling victim to poor process and being little more than a forum for self-serving mud slinging and the pursuit of personal, corporate and political vendettas”. Experts promptly deemed the proposal deeply suboptimal. The ensuing consultation process was then dragged out for years. The government had a draft of its preferred legislation ready in January 2020, but Porter, the attorney general at the time, didn’t want to flag it “during the holiday period”. He warned the “consultation process will be extensive and will take as long as necessary to ensure the model we deliver has the powers and resources it needs to be effective, while also avoiding the pitfalls that have been seen with similar state-based bodies”. The final legislation threatened to surface in the final two parliamentary sitting weeks of 2021, but it didn’t land in the parliament. Morrison attempted to blame Labor. But his problem was internal. One of his backbenchers crossed the floor in an effort to trigger debate on a stronger model being championed by independent MP Helen Haines. On that same day in December 2018, Morrison told reporters he was “looking to legislate before the election” a religious discrimination bill. But the proposal would be slow going because of different objectives within the government. Some wanted a law to protect “religious freedom” – giving Australians a positive right to express religious opinions. Morrison had once declared there was “no more fundamental liberty” than freedom of religion. But others had significant reservations. Porter produced a hybrid – an anti-discrimination bill with more assertive religious freedom elements. By July 2019, Morrison told the opening session of the Hillsong annual conference that the religious freedom debate was too rights oriented, and it was “not the laws that make freedom of religion work, it’s the culture that accepts it”. Roll forward to the final parliamentary sitting fortnight of 2021, and the same internal divisions that had made the proposal so difficult to land continued to fester. In an effort to get the bill to parliament, the current attorney general, Michaelia Cash, agreed to drop the divisive “Folau clause”, which would have protected employers from claims of indirect discrimination if they sanctioned employees for misconduct for expressing religious beliefs. But the internal wrangling continues, with the fate of the legislation uncertain. Just before Christmas, Cash appeared to renege on a deal with Liberal moderates on the package. Moderates want immediate changes to protect gay students from discrimination in religious schools.",News/Australia news,Unfinished business: eight things on Scott Morrison’s to-do list as election nears,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/unfinished-business-eight-things-on-scott-morrisons-to-do-list-as-election-nears
12/28/2021,"At the end of November, my mum asked me to help her get the nativity scene out of the attic. It was uncharacteristically early for her to set it up, but given the two years we’ve all experienced, I understood her desire for the year to be finished and the holidays to arrive. And now here we are, deep in a strange festive season, where party invitations are dependent on producing a negative rapid antigen test.  The threat of catching Covid aside, parties can be hazardous places, especially for our clothes. From less-than socially distanced dancefloors to cigarette smoke and spilt drinks – this week we ask some experts how to care for your outfit, once the revelry is over. No matter how tempting it may be, Chloe Naughton, the program director for Melbourne Fashion festival, says “the worst thing you can do is take off whatever you’re wearing and leave it in a pile on the floor”. Instead, she suggests hanging it, or laying it flat on a drying rack or table to air it out before putting it away. If you have a steamer, and extraordinary willpower, she suggests giving each piece a light steam first. When Naughton gets home at the end of the night, the fabric and construction of the garment will determine whether she hangs it up or lays it down, since some things like knits and heavy cottons can be stretched by hanging. A good rule of thumb is to hang up clothes you’d normally hang, and lay clothes you’d normally fold out flat. This is even more important if your clothes smell like cigarettes. She says be sure to hang them up outside your wardrobe, and not put them anywhere near your clean clothes. “Then take it to the dry cleaners first thing in the morning.” At a pinch, she says, you can also use a fabric freshener spray. Naughton says if someone spills wine, the best thing to do is pour sparkling water on it immediately to flush out the stain. She says this helps to “break it down and stops it from embedding into the threads”. But if it’s a delicate fabric, like silk, it should be left alone and taken promptly to the dry cleaners the morning after. If some oil falls on your shirt or pants, she says it “needs to be washed out then and there, because if the oil soaks in it will stain”. It may feel weird to walk around in a moist shirt, but if you want it to survive the night, Naughton suggests you “go to the bathroom straight away and use lukewarm water and hand soap” to remove the oil. For stains that you may not notice until the end of the night, oil, red and brown sauce or wine stains can be softened with a cool soak and then run through a hot wash of at least 60C, says Steve Anderton, a laundry expert from the consultancy group LTC Worldwide. It’s best to do this while the stains are fresh; if marks persist try using a general stain remover. He says to use a premium detergent containing a biological enzyme and an emulsifying agent. Anderton says garments made from polyester or nylon are highly attracted to fats and oils, including sweat. So if they’ve been stained or worn enthusiastically on the dancefloor, they’ll need to be treated with an emulsifying agent to break this bond. You may need to wash them more than once at 60C – but no higher. Polyester is thermoplastic, and excessive heat can damage it. Naughton says, “if it’s a really hot summer’s day and I know I’ll be at a party in the sun, I’ll choose to wear a breathable fabric like a linen or a cotton”. She says this is because these fabrics allow her body to breathe and make for a more comfortable experience. Naughton recommends taking most garments to the dry cleaners the day after a party, and preferably opt for eco-dry cleaners. Especially prioritise delicate fabrics. She says, “silk needs to be treated by the professionals”. It’s important to remember that silk may appear fine the day after a party, but stains from sweat and deodorant can damage the fabric over time and appear later. If a New Year’s Day run-about to find an open dry cleaner feels a bit ambitious, rethink wearing a silk jacket or chiffon dress on a night that may get rowdy.

12/28/2021,"In the mid-1980s, the Melbourne arts community was divided. In the underground, there was a vibrant punk music and arts scene, while the big arts institutions, such as the National Gallery of Victoria, were seen as old-school and out of date – unsupportive of young artists and lavishing precious public funds on overseas acquisitions. One such purchase was Picasso’s The Weeping Woman, painted about the same time as his famous Guernica. The flamboyant NGV gallery director Patrick McCaughey bought the artwork for a staggering (at the time) $1.6m. But the terrible Australian dollar meant the sale price was actually closer to $2m.  McCaughey predicted that the lurid lime green and purple Picasso “will haunt Melbourne for the next 100 years”. His prediction turned out to be true – but for all the wrong reasons. In 1986, not long after excitedly introducing The Weeping Woman to the city, it went missing. Who stole Picasso’s painting from the NGV is the subject of a four-part SBS documentary called Framed, presented by The Feed’s Marc Fennell. As the documentary reveals, it took a couple of days for the painting’s theft to be noticed. A note on the wall said it had been relocated to “the ACT”. Staff and visitors assumed it had been relocated to a gallery in the ACT – the Australian Capital Territory – until the Age received a typewritten letter signed by the “Australian Cultural Terrorists”. This group claimed responsibility for stealing the Picasso and said the painting would be destroyed in a week if their demands were not met. The Victorian arts minister at the time, Race Mathews, who was also the police minister, was singled out in the letter for “the clumsy, unimaginative stupidity of the administration” in this “hick State”. The Australian Cultural Terrorists made a list of demands, including more funding for the arts and a prize for young Australian artists. The theft of The Weeping Woman became hot news around the world. It had all the ingredients of a great story: the stuttering, bow-tie wearing, charismatic NGV head McCaughey pleading for the (uninsured) painting to be returned; the brazen, articulate and verbally aggressive thieves; the huge police operation that included draining the moat around the NGV; and then the rumour network set alight with everyone seeming to know who did it but nobody agreeing who it was. Using a mix of re-enactments and interviews, Fennell has assembled a mix of people who were there at the time, including the journalist Virginia Trioli, the then chief conservator of the NGV, Thomas Dixon, the cultural critic and journalist Ashley Crawford, the artist and activist Gabrielle de Vietri, the journalist Margaret Simon and a former detective sergeant, Bob Quigley. It’s interesting how differently things played out in 1986. There was little security at the gallery, including no CCTV, and the brand of typewriter used to write the ransom notes was key to finding the perpetrator. It’s the sort of story you assume couldn’t happen now. The painting later turned up unharmed in a locker at Spencer Street station but the crime was never solved. Thirty-five years later, the story is still captivating.",Arts/Culture,Framed: Marc Fennell unpacks the NGV art heist that rocked Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/28/framed-marc-fennell-unpacks-the-ngv-art-heist-that-rocked-australia
12/28/2021,"A 61-year-old refugee who had been held for more than nine years in Australian immigration detention has finally been granted a three-year temporary protection visa. Masoumeh Torkpour fled Iran in 2011 and has been in detention ever since. In 2018 she was granted refugee status and a refugee tribunal found that she should be issued a temporary protection visa because her mental health issues – including OCD, depression and adjustment disorder – were being exacerbated by conditions in detention.  However, she was denied a visa due to rigorous “character” tests. Torkpour was sentenced to two months’ imprisonment during her detention for spitting at and biting detention centre staff over disputes about food and access to a mobile phone. She had been granted asylum in Canada in 1991 after fleeing Iran two years earlier, but was jailed for four years for stabbing a woman she found in bed with her husband. As a result she was barred from obtaining a permanent visa in Canada. She returned to Iran from Canada in 2005 to care for her dying father, but was then detained for having left Iran illegally. The prison sentence in Canada also made her ineligible for a permanent visa in Australia on character grounds. Torkpour was given accommodation in a Melbourne hotel after her release on 15 December, but has now been advised she must find a new home. A spokesperson for the Department of Home Affairs said eligible individuals released from immigration detention could receive transitional support for up to six weeks. Torkpour said she welcomed freedom after so many years, but was struggling to adjust after so many years of being moved from one form of detention to another. She said it was “very stressful to be dumped into the community alone to fend for myself, while I have mobility problems and everything makes me extremely anxious”. Torkpour said the first thing she bought after her release was a candle. “Imprisonment banned me from lighting a candle for years. Finally, I can buy a candle to light on Christmas in honour of Mary, who was lonely too,” she said. Jana Favero, of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said women on temporary visas faced innumerable challenges. “They face barriers to work, find it almost impossible to access emergency housing and are ripe for exploitation. “We are the only country in the world that only grants temporary protection to people found to be refugees. We are setting people up to fail and forcing them into poverty and destitution.” Torkpour said she now hoped to be reunited with her son, Daniel, who lives in Canada. “For years I was labelled as dangerous and rejected,” she said. “But my broken heart hopes that after 11 years, 2022 will bring my son Daniel back from Canada into my arms.” Whatever the future holds, Torkpour cannot be sent back to Iran, as it rejects the involuntary return of its citizens who have sought asylum overseas.",News/Australia news,‘Finally I can buy a candle’: 61-year-old refugee released after nine years in Australian detention,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/finally-i-can-buy-a-candle-61-year-old-refugee-released-after-nine-years-in-australian-detention
12/28/2021,"The government’s religious discrimination law could place “a heavy burden” on already marginalised Muslim communities because it allows discrimination on national security grounds, Islamic organisations have said. Scott Morrison has said the proposed legislation should “give Australians of faith confidence – confidence to be themselves and confidence in the country they belong to”.  But three organisations have raised concerns about a section of the bill that says it is not unlawful “for a person to discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person’s religious belief or activity” for national security reasons. The exemption applies if the person discriminating “is performing a function or exercising a power relating to law enforcement, national security or intelligence under a law or program of the commonwealth”. The bill says “the conduct constituting the discrimination” must be “reasonably necessary in performing the function or exercising the power”. The Australian Muslim Advocacy Network (Aman) said the proposal “imposes a heavy burden on Muslim communities who are already marginalised and feel highly vulnerable”. “There is absolutely no legal justification for authorities to discriminate against communities or people based on their faith,” the network said in a submission to the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. “Their work is to assess and prevent the risk of violence.” The government has argued the bill is needed to prohibit direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or activity in work and other areas of public life. Aman argued other parts of the bill provided “a much-needed safeguard” from discrimination, but the exception clause “sends a dangerous signal to law enforcement that religious discrimination against Muslims will continue to be necessary”. It cited an Australian Human Rights Commission survey that found the most common situations in which Australian Muslims reported experiencing unfavourable treatment included when dealing with law enforcement. This was nominated by half of all respondents. Aman said Australia’s definition of terrorism included a motive of religious, political or ideological causes. According to the submission, the idea of a religious cause of terrorism “propagates the lie that Islamic religiosity leads to terrorism” and had also “legitimised Isil movements”. Authorities and the media labelled the activities of Islamic State and other overseas terrorist groups as religiously-motivated, the submission said, “even though their actions would be sufficiently and more appropriately covered under ‘ideological’ or ‘political’ cause”. “This submission notes that authorities do not refer to white supremacists as ‘patriotically motivated’ or ‘patriotic cause’, even though that is how they may refer to themselves,” Aman said. The Islamic Council of Victoria also called for the removal of the exemption, saying it would “enable law enforcement and security agencies to allow biases, stereotypes and unfair procedures to govern their functions and powers”. “Muslims have long been subjected to racial profiling and targeting under the guise of national security,” the council said in its submission. “The introduction of [this section] will only make it clear that the commonwealth government believes that religion is a legitimate basis for discriminating against individuals and religious groups.” The Australian National Imams Council told the committee the exception appeared to be “unduly broad in the protection which it provides”. “If such a provision operates to provide a broad exemption to law enforcement, national security and intelligence functions, it risks alienating Muslims and creating a sense of mistrust given the experiences of coercive and investigative powers being misused,” the council said. The bill says the definition of national security includes the process of granting, revoking or denying Australian government security clearances. A spokesperson for the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, said the exception was “not directed towards any specific religion”. It was “necessary to ensure that nothing in the bill interferes with the ability of bodies that perform law enforcement, national security and intelligence functions, or exercise associated powers, to continue to protect Australia’s national security”. “The exception recognises that, in some circumstances, a person’s religious belief or activity may have a connection to law enforcement, national security or intelligence,” the spokesperson said. “For example, criminal or terrorist acts may be motivated by certain religious beliefs, and so those beliefs would be relevant to a law enforcement investigation.” Cash’s spokesperson said the exception was “subject to limitations that ensure the exception is a reasonable limitation on the rights to equality and non-discrimination”. When the prime minister introduced the bill to parliament in late November, he said: “To deny protection from discrimination for their religious beliefs is to tear at the very fabric of multiculturalism in this country.” But the government was unable to pass the bill before parliament rose for the summer break amid unresolved internal divisions, including over a push from moderate Liberal MPs to protect gay students from discrimination in religious schools. The human rights committee is due to complete its report by 4 February, shortly before the scheduled resumption of parliament. The Senate’s legal and constitutional affairs legislation committee is also conducting an inquiry into the bill with the same deadline. Labor has reserved its position until the inquiries are complete, with leader Anthony Albanese saying he supports religious freedom but also declaring changes should not come at “the expense of discriminating on the basis of other people’s characteristics”.",News/Australia news,"Coalition’s religious discrimination bill sends ‘dangerous signal’, Muslim groups say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/coalitions-religious-discrimination-bill-sends-dangerous-signal-muslim-groups-say
12/28/2021,"A South Australian doctor who has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in crowdfunding for a potential Covid-19 vaccine has been given permission to submit clinical data for assessment by Australia’s medicines regulator. Prof Nikolai Petrovsky, who has been publicly critical of Covid-19 vaccines approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has raised more than $850,000 on the fundraising website GoFundMe for Covax-19, a vaccine candidate developed by his company, Vaxine Pty Ltd.  Petrovsky has previously published many peer-reviewed papers on diabetes, genomics and vaccine development, but he has been criticised for advocating for Covax-19 to be approved for use in Australia without making publicly available substantial peer-reviewed clinical evidence to support its efficacy. Covax-19, also known as Spikogen, is made from synthetically manufactured spike proteins and completed a phase I clinical trial – a small safety study of 40 patients – in Australia last year. To date, no results from Covax-19 human clinical trials have been published in peer-reviewed journals, evidence of which is usually required for regulatory approval in Australia. One study on Covax-19’s effects in mice and ferrets has been published in the peer-reviewed journal Vaccine. Covax-19 has been approved for emergency use in Iran, where phase II and III clinical trials are currently under way. The lack of publicly available data from clinical trials to support statements about Covax-19’s efficacy has raised concerns among experts, particularly while Vaxine is soliciting donations from the public. They are pushing for more transparency around the timeline of clinical trials conducted in Iran, and calling on Petrovsky to publish the results of his research in peer-reviewed journals. As his company raises funds for Covax-19’s development and TGA approval, Petrovsky has criticised competing vaccines already provisionally approved by the regulator, leaving experts concerned confidence in those Covid vaccines may be undermined. His GoFundMe has also sought support for a clinical trial in Australia, describing previous government funding of the vaccine as “hush money”. A later petition has asked the federal government to provide Vaxine with more financial support. Petrovsky, an endocrinologist at Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide, runs Vaxine Pty Ltd with his wife, Sharen Petrovsky, the company’s business manager. Sharen, who also goes by Sharen Pringle, created the GoFundMe in October. The professor has refused to personally receive a TGA-approved vaccine because he says he has been vaccinated with Covax-19. “It has been agreed that I am taking long service leave from Flinders Medical Centre until such time as I can receive a vaccination exemption or the vaccine mandates are withdrawn,” he said in a statement to Guardian Australia in November. SA Health – which runs Flinders Medical Centre – said it was “unable to comment on matters relating to the employment of individuals”. Petrovsky, who also holds an unpaid academic title as a professor at Flinders University, has spoken in recent months against policies imposed to control the pandemic. A viral clip of him speaking at an anti-vaccine mandate event in Adelaide, in which he describes being “extremely uncomfortable” with the TGA-approved vaccines and “not fully confident about what’s happened over the past 18 months”, has been shared widely online including by Craig Kelly, Rod Culleton and apparent vaccine sceptics. In that video, Petrovsky described mRNA vaccines as “very new technologies in their infancy”, and asked “what level of confidence do we have that they have been through the usual process [of rigorous testing]”. Petrovsky’s GoFundMe page is critical of government funding for the biotech firm CSL and the “AstraZeneca vaccine that has been linked to deaths from central venous thrombosis”. In a recent podcast interview, he claimed Australians would be able to import his vaccine from overseas to administer themselves, though he acknowledged this would not qualify people as vaccinated under Australian Covid-19 vaccine policies. “Even in Australia, there are routes that people can get access to unapproved products if they are approved somewhere else, so people can personally import a vaccine for their own use,” Petrovsky said. In that interview, Petrovsky said about 1m doses of Covax-19 had been distributed in Iran, and that a Covid-19 vaccine for cats was in development in Kazakhstan. Guardian Australia has not been able to independently verify the number of doses distributed in Iran. He has also referred to mRNA vaccines as “gene therapy vaccines”, saying the technology was developed “to put new genes inside people”. The TGA told Guardian Australia: “Any suggestion that mRNA vaccines are ‘gene therapy’ is categorically rejected. mRNA vaccines do not interact with DNA to change our genetic code in any way so the assertion is patently false.” On 15 December the TGA granted “provisional determination” to Covax-19 – a status which lasts for six months and serves as a preliminary step that allows a company to submit clinical data for the regulator to assess. The status is no guarantee that the vaccine will be approved for use. Advice published by the TGA says the regulatory body considers phase III clinical trial data published in a peer-reviewed journal to be “baseline” evidence for a vaccine’s efficacy. In a statement on 14 December, the TGA said: “Comprehensive data demonstrating the safety, quality and effectiveness of COVAX-19 (also known as Spikogen) has not [yet] been submitted to the TGA for assessment.” In announcing Vaxine’s provisional determination status, the TGA said it had considered “factors such as the evidence of a plan to submit comprehensive clinical data”. Associate Prof Paul Griffin, director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services in Brisbane, said it was unusual that Covax-19’s regulatory approval was being crowdfunded, given the “tremendous” funding opportunities provided to promising Covid vaccines throughout the pandemic. In a Conversation article in June, Griffin described Covax-19 as a “potentially promising” local candidate, but now says he is troubled by the lack of publicly available clinical data to substantiate claims about its effectiveness. “While it’s great to see Australian scientists having a go and trying to develop new vaccines, particularly for Covid at the moment, I’m quite concerned about [the lack of publicly available data about] that vaccine,” Griffin said. “People need to have some confidence … that the claims being made are substantiated with good quality data,” he said. “I would be very confident if that was forthcoming … it would be very easy to go down well-established paths of obtaining more funding,” Griffin added, citing government grants as an example. Griffin is also concerned that Petrovsky’s criticism of other vaccines while promoting his own “could undermine confidence in Covid vaccines that have already been approved”. He said Petrovsky had generated a “very large following of people … who are holding off getting licensed vaccines because they’re hearing that [Covax-19] vaccine is the solution for them”. A $100m deal to sell Vaxine to biopharmaceutical firm Immuron previously fell through, according to a report in the AFR in September. Petrovsky’s crowdfunding effort initially sought money to apply for TGA approval, and now has a target of $1m to run a “post approval” trial. Initial application and evaluation fees for a new prescription medicine total more than $250,000. An update on the fundraising page said the “Phase 4/post approval Trial [sic]” – also referred to elsewhere as a “Phase 2/3b Study” – was “anticipated to commence mid-to-late January 2022”. Sharen Petrovsky is described as the “clinical trial manager” in letters sent to those interested in participating in any trial, which have been seen by Guardian Australia. In November, people who had registered for the company’s trial received letters on Vaxine letterhead informing them of South Australia’s then policy that participation in a Covid-19 vaccine trial was a valid exemption from South Australia’s vaccine requirements. The letter said: “In order to preserve the integrity of the clinical trial, it is an enrolment criterion that you be Covid-19 vaccine naive at the time of your entry into the trial. Hence receipt of any other Covid-19 vaccine is a key trial exclusion criteria.” SA Health was forced on 27 November to issue a statement clarifying that simply registering for a proposed trial was not grounds for an exemption to vaccine mandates. “South Australia does not just recognise being on a waiting list for a proposed vaccine trial as a reason for exemption from a vaccination requirement,” it said. In a new direction issued on 8 December, SA police said taking part in Covid vaccination trial was no longer a valid reason for vaccination exemption. An update posted to the GoFundMe page on 8 December said the company had submitted an ethics approval application to conduct the study. But as of 22 December, SA Health said it had not received an application for ethics approval. “At this stage, the Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee (SAC-HREC) has received no submission for Vaxine’s Covax-19 vaccine Phase 4 trial,” it said in a statement. Petrovsky did not respond to requests for comment to clarify what ethics committee the company had submitted an application to. In a statement, the National Health and Medical Research Council said: “An informal registration process, or providing information about a future trial to generate interest in it, does not necessarily require ethics approval.” All human research in Australia is expected to conform to the requirements of a national statement on ethical research conduct, it added. Dr Kyle Sheldrick, a medical doctor and researcher, would like Petrovsky to make the results of the clinical trials in Iran publicly available. Petrovsky’s GoFundMe describes Covax-19 as “showing protection against the Delta virus variant in a Phase 3 clinical trial in 16,876 subjects in Iran”, but that trial is not set to be completed until March 2022. No peer-reviewed interim results have been published. Sheldrick was critical of the timeline of the phase III trial, telling Guardian Australia it was unusual for a vaccine to be approved so rapidly in any country. The trial is listed on the US ClinicalTrials.gov registry as having started on 7 August 2021 – the date on which the first participant was enrolled. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning According to listed information, it has an estimated primary completion date of 1 March 2022. This is when all participants have been monitored for six months after receiving their second dose – corresponding to 201 days from the last patient receiving their first dose. Working backwards, 201 days before 1 March gives a date of 12 August. “[That] would then imply they were planning to recruit their entire population base in five days,” Sheldrick said. The trial defined the vaccine’s efficacy based on the number of Covid infections between 35 and 201 days after people received their first dose. Assuming the first enrolled participant was on 7 August, an infection would count only if it occurred after September 11. Covax-19 was approved in Iran on 6 October. Based on that date, Sheldrick estimated the maximum time participants were followed up after their second jab was 25 days. “We’re talking about an incredibly short period of follow up,” he said. Griffin said: “There’s a reason we have a process in terms of sharing results and publishing in peer-reviewed journals, so we can be assured of the quality of the content and see for ourselves that this vaccine is potentially safe and effective.” “That just hasn’t been forthcoming,” he said. “There was lots of talk … that there would be some good data coming through. Six months down the track, while there’s lots of claims of higher levels of safety and efficacy, we still haven’t seen good data to actually verify any of that.” Petrovsky told Guardian Australia in November that publishing clinical trial results in scientific journals had “no bearing on whether a product is approved or not”. “Despite being under no obligation to do so, we do of course plan to publish all the clinical data on our vaccine in a high profile scientific journal but … of course such papers take time to write.” Petrovsky also said claims Covax-19’s efficacy were unsubstantiated was “an outrageous claim”. He said the Iranian FDA had “independently peer-reviewed all the phase 3 outcome data”. An official document Petrovsky provided to Guardian Australia did confirm the Iranian FDA had given emergency approval for the vaccine but it did not contain information to verify this statement. According to GoFundMe’s website, money can be withdrawn from a campaign at any time. Vaxine was last year awarded $1m – the same amount as the crowdfunding target – to develop Covax-19 by the Australian government’s Biomedical Translation Bridge initiative.

Accepting the funding was “a decision we regret to this day,” he said. On December 21, Vaxine sent an email to its supporters with the subject “A call to action”, asking people to sign an e-petition to the parliament of Australia. That petition, which closed for signatures on 22 December, called on the federal government to provide “necessary financial support and advance purchase commitments” to Vaxine for Covax-19. Meanwhile, experts continue to push for transparency in clinical data. “I am always suspicious of companies talking about their science without publishing their science, while actively fundraising based on that science,” Sheldrick said. Griffin said: “We don’t know this vaccine is safe and effective yet. It might prove to be in the future, but we have insufficient [publicly available] evidence at this point in time.”",News/World news,Questions over data transparency around Australian doctor’s $1m GoFundMe Covid-19 vaccine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/28/questions-over-data-transparency-around-australian-doctors-1m-gofundme-covid-19-vaccine
12/28/2021,"The Covid positive test rate in New South Wales has risen to 6.5%, the highest since the pandemic began. The positivity rate is up from 1.73% a week ago and 0.71% a fortnight ago, a figure some epidemiologists say is likely to mean a proportion of cases are going undetected.  In the 24-hour period to 8pm on Sunday, 97,241 tests were conducted, with 6,324 cases detected, resulting in a positive test rate of 6.5%. Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, an epidemiologist at the University of Sydney, said: “Early in the pandemic, the World Health Organization set 5% test positivity and below as the marker of having infections and transmission relatively under control.” After the easing of restrictions in mid-October, the positive test rate hovered at 0.5% or below while testing numbers remained relatively high. “Around 15 December our test positivity started to depart from the [roughly] 1% which we typically have in NSW,” Martiniuk said. The timing of the uptick in test positivity corresponded with the lifting of restrictions in conjunction with the arrival of the Omicron variant and holiday socialising. “When there is a high test positive rate, the number of confirmed cases is likely to be only capturing some of the true number of cases.” Provided testing turnouts are consistent, the higher the positive test rate climbs, the greater the extent of undetected spread of Covid. While the state has recorded its highest positive test rates since the start of the pandemic, Martiniuk said it was important to keep in mind the slightly lower testing numbers over the Christmas weekend. Head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, prof Nancy Baxter, said while the increased positive test rate did indicate a level of undetected viral spread, it was difficult to know the extent. “It does however mean people are using the service appropriately. The increase in positivity is not consistent with the narrative that inappropriate or unnecessary testing is what’s driving the long lines,” Baxter said. Baxter also said an increase in the positive test rate could be due in part to rapid antigen tests having detected asymptomatic cases, which were then confirmed by PCR tests. Testing facilities across the state have been overwhelmed in the face of the outbreak; patients are routinely waiting 72 hours to receive results, with some reporting waiting times of well over 100 hours. 100 hours down & still waiting for a result. Entire household in lockdown attempting to do the right thing. But 4 days+ and no result and no answer at the only number provided.

St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney was forced to issue an apology; the medical director of SydPath, the hospital’s pathology service, prof Anthony Dodds, attributed the mistakes to human error. On Monday the pathology lab announced another 995 people had been prematurely sent negative test results while the actual results were yet to be determined. The hospital said the additional results would be delivered by Monday night. Despite the increased positivity rate, Martiniuk says NSW’s testing levels are “very good”. In Malawi, where Martiniuk has worked, test positivity has remained “comparatively high” due to lower testing levels. In Ontario, Canada, with a population double that of NSW, about 70,000 tests are being carried out a day, or roughly half of NSW’s tests before Christmas Day. There, the positive test rate is 18.7%. Martiniuk emphasised the ongoing importance of testing in slowing and reducing the spread of Covid infections. “Testing will help us understand the potential load on hospitals and primary care.”",News/Australia news,"Covid positive test rate in NSW jumps to 6.5%, highest since start of pandemic",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/28/covid-positive-test-rate-in-nsw-jumps-to-65-highest-since-start-of-pandemic
12/28/2021,"There’s never been more ways to ask for money on the internet. For rightwing extremists looking to monetise hate, that can be a big opportunity – and the earning potential of these digital assets hasn’t gone unnoticed in Australia. Earlier this year, I traced funding networks associated with a sample of Australian channels that share rightwing extremist content on the chat app Telegram, and found links to at least 22 online funding tools. These included donation requests via wallet addresses for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, monero, ethereum and litecoin.  Of course an interest in cryptocurrencies is not on its own indicative of racism or extremism, but a recent analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) found a cohort of white supremacists largely originating from North America has likely generated “a substantial profit” from bitcoin by getting in early, giving them access to funds “that would almost certainly be unavailable to them without cryptocurrency”. Controversial Canadian “alt-right” figure Stefan Molyneux, who denies being a white supremacist but was pushed off YouTube for his commentary about women and “scientific racism”, has received at least 1,250 bitcoin from supporters according to the SPLC (one Bitcoin was worth A$68,647 at the time of writing). As was posted in March on a Telegram channel associated with Blair Cottrell, who was convicted by a Victorian court of inciting hatred of Muslims in 2017: “crypto is actually making a lot of our guys rich.” While bitcoin may have created eye watering profits for “early-adopter” rightwing extremists, privacy coins like monero – which attempt to obscure the origin and destination of transactions – also appear to be increasingly embraced by far-right groups. After the National Socialist Network’s Thomas Sewell was charged with a number of offences this year in connection with an alleged assault and an alleged armed robbery, there was a donation drive to cover the Australian’s legal fees. In December alone, support requests for both bitcoin and monero donations were shared into Telegram channels associated with US and Australian far-right livestreamers with tens of thousands of followers, as well as accounts linked to Australia’s anti-lockdown movement. Sewell is pleading not guilty to the charges. Donation requests by the Australian far right – albeit for legal fees as well as content creation or lifestyle needs – can serve to solidify ties with followers as well as provide the chance to engage with international networks. While this activity isn’t illegal, the president of Insight Threat Intelligence and an expert on terrorism financing, Jessica Davis, says that in other cases regulators are challenged by the blurry line between fundraising that supports activities such as the creation of propaganda and the risk that some extremists may use it to support acts of terror. One of the most prominent terrorist attacks associated with far-right ideology in recent years does not appear to have been directly supported by external funding. New Zealand’s royal commission into the 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack concluded the terrorist was self-funded. But money was still an important part of the picture. The terrorist made at least 14 donations using PayPal and bitcoin to groups and individuals who promoted far-right views. Davis says, in some cases, donating to extremists “does start to demonstrate how seriously people are taking that propaganda”. It can be tempting to see far-right fundraising as something that happens far outside the financial systems we use to buy lunch or book flights. And yet, even in my Australian sample, mainstream services such as PayPal and crowdfunding sites like Buy Me a Coffee remain popular. And as cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, their use becomes increasingly frictionless – an evolution that will have implications for tracking and regulation. A professor of computer science at Elon University and co-author of the SPLC analysis, Dr Megan Squire, points to website plugins like BitPay, which help facilitate smooth cryptocurrency payments. “The technology and some simple interface solutions can start to … lower the barrier to entry, and make it easier for ‘Joe Blow’ user to actually donate,” she says. Davis has also observed the growing adoption of what she calls “financial tradecraft” that makes it harder for investigators to follow the trail, including methods of obscuring which wallets are receiving funds. Further complicating the picture are digital currencies created by entertainment and communication platforms. Perhaps the best known of these projects is Facebook’s troubled Libra project. The company behind the chat app Telegram also launched a blockchain project and cryptocurrency despite its reputation for failing to police extremist content. The company shut it down after pushback from the US Security and Exchange Commission. Then there is the blockchain-based Odysee. Viewers can support content creators using a cryptocurrency called LBRY Credits or cash tips. While a number of Australian far-right content creators use Odysee’s video platform, the ultimate motive is unclear: it’s just as likely to be used as a backup for videos that could be removed from YouTube than as a fundraising tool. But there are potential points of pressure and scrutiny for far-right fundraising, such as cryptocurrency exchanges – where fiat currencies can be converted. Some cryptocurrency exchanges already have terms of services that prohibit hate speech and other activities. Coinbase, for example, reportedly blocked transfers to the notorious neo-nazi site The Daily Stormer in 2017. Earlier this year, the company’s user agreement explicitly prohibited uses that “encourage hate, racial intolerance, or violent acts against others”. The push to remove far-right individuals and groups from funding platforms has typically been the result of public pressure. Following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, for example, PayPal and other services were lobbied to remove accounts used by figures involved in the event. Similar pressure has come to bear after the 6 January insurrection, which was also used as an opportunity to make online content and ask for donations by a number of far-right actors. However, the power such payment tools have to remove accounts for all types of users, often without transparency and avenues for appeal, is of increasing concern. Given this fresh spotlight, Squire says we may see a renewed push into cryptocurrencies by the far-right. “The tech for keeping yourself secret is a lot better now than it was in 2017 after Unite the Right in Charlottesville, which was the last big moment when a lot of these guys moved onto crypto,” she says. “There are more coins, there are more services. It’s harder to get a handle on.” Ariel Bogle is a researcher and journalist with a focus on technology and extremism.
