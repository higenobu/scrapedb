1/31/2022,"The leaders of the Senate foreign relations committee said on Sunday they were on the cusp of approving “the mother of all sanctions” against Vladimir Putin, warning there would be no appeasement as the Russian president contemplates an invasion of Ukraine.  “We cannot have a Munich moment again,” the panel’s Democratic chair, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, told CNN’s State of the Union, referring to the 1938 agreement by which allies ceded parts of Czechoslovakia to Hitler, believing it would stave off war. “Putin will not stop if he believes the west will not respond,” Menendez said. “We saw what he did in 2008 in Georgia, we saw what he did in 2014 in pursuit of Crimea. He will not stop.” Menendez said he believed bipartisan negotiations for a severe package of sanctions against Putin were “on the one-yard line”, despite disagreements with Republicans over whether they should be imposed before or after any Russian invasion. Tensions on the Ukraine border continued to escalate over the weekend with Reuters reporting the Russian military build-up included supplies of blood in anticipation of casualties. The UK government promised to ramp up sanctions against Putin and his associates to deter aggression. “There is an incredible bipartisan resolve for support of Ukraine, and an incredibly strong bipartisan resolve to have severe consequences for Russia if it invades, and in some cases for what it has already done,” Menendez told CNN in a joint interview with his committee’s Republican ranking member, James Risch of Wisconsin. “We are building on the legislation that both Senator Risch wrote independently, and I wrote, which I called the mother of all sanctions. It’s to include a variety of elements, massive sanctions against the most significant Russian banks, crippling to their economy, Russia sovereign debt. These are sanctions beyond any that we have ever levied before.” Risch said talks had been a “24 hour-a-day effort for the last several days” in an attempt to reach agreement over timing and content of the package, and that he was optimistic. “That’s a work in progress,” Risch said, when pressed over discussions about pre-emptive sanctions or measures to be taken in the event of an invasion. “[But] I’m more than cautiously optimistic that when we get back to DC tomorrow that we’re going to be moving forward.” Menendez said he believed western allies did not have to wait to start penalising Putin. “There are some sanctions that could take place up front because of what Russia has already done, cyber attacks on Ukraine, false flag operations, the efforts to undermine the Ukrainian government internally,” he said. “But then the devastating sanctions that ultimately would crush Russia’s economy, and the continuing lethal aid that we are going to send, means Putin has to decide how many body bags of Russian sons are going to return to Russia. “The sanctions we’re talking about would come later on if he invades, some sanctions would come up front for what has been done already, but the lethal aid will travel no matter what.”",News/World news,US Senate panel close to approving ‘mother of all sanctions’ against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/ukraine-crisis-us-sanctions-russia-putin
1/31/2022,"The vaccine sceptic and anti-lockdown campaigner Laurence Fox has said he has coronavirus. The actor, who finished sixth in last month’s London mayoral elections, tweeted a picture on Sunday of a positive lateral flow test.  Above it, he wrote: “In other news, felt shivery and crap yesterday. Turns out I have been visited by Lord Covid at last and have the Omnicold (if the LFT is to be believed!) On the #Ivermectin, saline nasal rinse, quercetin, paracetamol and ibruprofen. More man flu than Wu-flu at the moment.” Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic treatment used mainly for animals but approved in different doses to treat some parasitic worms in humans. It has not been proved to be effective at preventing or treating Covid but has been promoted by vaccine-sceptic public figures such as the comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan, who said he used the drug to treat himself when he became sick with Covid, and the Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Fox’s tweet came four days after he posted a picture of himself wearing a T-shirt with a slogan saying “No vaccine needed, I have an immune system.” In another tweet posted on Sunday, he said he was on day two of the virus. After a number of people commented in response to Fox’s tweet asking where he had got the Ivermectin and why he was taking it, he responded by saying: “Not only do you only have to sign a form saying you feel well to get into Mexico, but you can also buy drugs like Ivermectin over the counter that the vaccinaholics don’t want you to get hold of here. I’m so happy to be joining the natural immunity club. Going to have a nap.” Launching his mayoral campaign last year, Fox said he would not get the Covid jab until after 2023, by which time he claimed all the tests needed to convince him of its safety would be completed. He has also cast doubt on the UK’s death toll from the pandemic, claiming some doctors were seeking to add non-Covid deaths – including that of his mother in 2020 – to the official tally to support the “government’s fear-based narrative”. And Fox has questioned the scientific basis of long Covid, which the Office for National Statistics estimates is affecting 1.3 million people, or 2% of the population, in the UK, based on people self-reporting symptoms that last more than a month after a Covid infection.",Arts/Culture,Laurence Fox says he has coronavirus and is taking Ivermectin,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/30/laurence-fox-has-coronavirus-and-taking-ivermectin
1/31/2022,"Derby County, clearly, have no intention of giving up. As they go into yet another week where their hopes of surviving as a club are up in the air, Wayne Rooney’s team gave their fans every reason to chant: “We’re Derby County, we fight till the end” on a day when the local support for the club was proved to be beyond doubt. In the sixth minute of stoppage time of a game that had been slated as potentially Derby’s last ever, substitute Krystian Bielik, on his first appearance for a year after an anterior cruciate ligament injury, took off into the air with his back to goal and scored the equaliser with a brilliant scissor-kick. That the Polish midfielder damaged his shoulder as he hit the ground did not dampen the manic celebrations that ensued.  Tom Lawrence’s free-kick had been headed back by Richard Stearman, the 34-year-old centre-half who had abdicated his defensive duties to go and join an all-out attack as Derby, not for the first time in this spirited winter, came from two goals behind to salvage a draw. Now Rooney, having declined the invitation to be interviewed for the Everton manager’s job, just needs the club to be saved. The season’s biggest Championship crowd, of 32,211, gave a sense of just how important this club is to its community. It would have to be a Nottingham Forest player who had started this match by rubbing salt into their wounds. Lyle Taylor, seven minutes into his Birmingham City debut on loan from Derby’s fiercest rivals, scored the first goal to dilute the fervour of the crowd before Scott Hogan made it 2-0. “Lyle Taylor, he’s sending you down,” sang the triumphal visiting fans as Derby’s big protest match got off to the worst start. Birmingham have been able to make five signings this month and when Onel Hernández prodded the ball wide, Taylor, who also scored against Derby for Forest last season, finished in style by sending the ball back where it had come from into the far side-netting. Birmingham have taken five points out of nine over the past nine days to alleviate their own relegation fears but it is more than the prospect of a mere demotion which made this such an emotional occasion for Derby. They turned up in their thousands to proclaim their support for this famous old club. It was less a protest march and more a communal cry for help as around 2,000 Derby fans walked from the town centre to Pride Park before kick-off. Club poet Jamie Thrasivoulou gave a stirring pre-match address to the sellout crowd, Derby’s biggest in the league for nearly three years, who were so wound up as the match started it felt as if the club’s whole future depended on the result of this one game. Thankfully the prospect of this being Derby’s last game before liquidation was allayed after Quantuma, the administrators, and the EFL had jointly announced a month’s stay of execution on Thursday. Three prospective buyers will be particularly interested this week to hear how an independent arbitration deals with the compensation claims of Middlesbrough and Wycombe, as clearing that part of the financial burden would be significant. Back on the pitch, Hogan volleyed in 11 minutes into the second half after Ryan Woods crossed from the right but Derby improved after Bielik came on and a sense of momentum gathered. It was a chaotic match, exacerbated by Luke Plange’s goal in the 87th minute that gave Derby hope of salvaging a late point. At one point Stearman was the only defender back against three Birmingham attackers as Rooney let even Curtis Davies off the leash. Sure enough, six minutes into added time, when a free-kick into the penalty area bounced up, Bielik took off into mid-air to perform a remarkably acrobatic finish to extend the sense that, hope against hope, Derby know how to pull off the most unlikely of comebacks.",Sport/Football,Derby fans stage protest before Bielik’s late heroics seal draw with Birmingham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/derby-birmingham-championship-match-report
1/31/2022,"US coalmining giant Peabody Energy has repeatedly submitted incorrect greenhouse gas emissions reports to the Australian government, prompting questions about the reliability of national climate data based on company assessments. The Clean Energy Regulator found Peabody had a history of filing inaccurate reports required under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act due to calculation errors, poor record-keeping and inconsistent data collection and analysis.  The mistakes were in both directions, leading to significant under- and over-reporting of emissions from the underground Wambo coalmine in New South Wales. The total error was large – when added up, out by more than 51% of the total emissions from the site – but the under- and over-reporting largely cancelled each other out. It meant the submitted total was 5.4% lower than what it should have been.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Peabody is the fifth-biggest coalminer in Australia, owning two thermal coalmines (used for electricity generation) and five metallurgical coalmines (for steelmaking). The company has agreed to hire an external consultant to compile its emissions reports using industry best-practice reporting methodologies, and to commission an independent auditor to examine its mines and other facilities. Annica Schoo, the lead environmental investigator at the Australian Conservation Foundation, said there were “more and more examples” of companies submitting emissions data that did not stand up to scrutiny. It follows Dutch scientists examining satellite imagery and finding the amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, leaking from some Queensland coalmines was greater than has been reported. Schoo said the company reports lodged with the regulator were used to help fulfil Australia’s international obligations under several treaties, including the Paris climate agreement, and as part of the government’s annual projections of future emissions. “The accuracy of this data is critical to getting on top of the climate crisis. The lack of care Peabody has shown is completely unacceptable,” she said. In response to questions, the regulator said there were no broader concerns about the accuracy of emissions data submitted to the government, and ensuring the data was accurate was “an enduring compliance and enforcement priority”. Emissions reports were reviewed and assessed, and that assessments drew upon a range of information sources, it said. A spokesperson for Peabody said the company understood the importance of accurately capturing and reporting emissions and had “at all times genuinely sought” to act in compliance with the act. “The reporting issues identified were completely unintentional and the result of calculation errors, which we have taken immediate actions to rectify,” they said. “An independent expert auditor has thoroughly reviewed our systems. We have already acted on many of his recommendations and our processes will be regularly reviewed to embed necessary improvements.” Schoo said the regulator had “done the right thing” by requiring Peabody to address its emissions reporting but it was a concern that it was the first compliance action of its type since the safeguard mechanism – which was promised to prevent increases in industrial emissions but in practice often hasn’t – was introduced in 2016. Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director with the Australia Institute, said the “enforceable undertakings” agreed by Peabody following the reporting failures were an example of the regulator being “all bark and no bite”. “We are left with rising emissions from Australia’s major polluters, enabled by loose reporting requirements,” he said.",News/Environment,Australian regulator finds large-scale emissions misreporting by coalminer Peabody,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/31/australian-regulator-finds-large-scale-emissions-misreporting-by-coalminer-peabody
1/31/2022,"That the narrator and author of this Florida-set debut share a name is no coincidence. This is raw, semi-autobiographical fiction at its most painfully honest, which could only have been written from actual experience of a teenage descent into addiction, criminality and young offender institutions. The first traps laid for the 14-year-old David, who’s run away from home to hook up with a girl, are appalling; he’s plied with crack by an old man at a bus stop and subsequently abused. What swiftly follows is the chaos of a desperate search for drugs, interspersed with rehab, reflection and reoffending. The total absence of plot makes All Day Is a Long Time feel more like a memoir.  Add the science of substance abuse and its effect on the brain and body, and the book can be teeth-grindingly gruelling. But in David’s quieter moments, when Sanchez’s writing has a fine, almost hallucinatory quality, it’s also a thought-provoking portrait of the vulnerability present in family life and how easily that can turn into damage. It’s telling, too, that even when the narrator is high, he spends days in the public library trying to make sense of himself and the world in the work of Hemingway and Melville, Descartes and Faulkner. The latter is an obvious influence on the bravura stream of consciousness in the final pages. So though the ending for David is left open, the biography in the endpapers offers succour: “David Sanchez lives in Tampa, Florida.

1/31/2022,"In 1997, Radiohead’s bassist Colin Greenwood was asked about Pink Floyd, a band whose name kept being mentioned in relation to their then-new album OK Computer. His younger brother Jonny was a fan, he said, and had made the band watch the 1972 film Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. “Dave Gilmour sitting on his arse playing guitar, and Roger Waters, with long, greasy hair, sandals and dusty flares, staggers over and picks up this big beater and whacks this gong,” he protested. “Ridiculous.” It’s a quote that comes to mind while watching the live stream of the second gig by the Smile, the latest project from Johnny Greenwood and Thom Yorke – an album’s worth of material performed in the round before an audience, the band’s three members in a kind of circular cage made of LED strip lights – and considering what the difference is between the music they’re making and that of Radiohead. The most obvious point of departure is that the drum stool is occupied by Tom Skinner, of acclaimed London jazz band Sons of Kemet, whose presence noticeably alters the band’s rhythmic flow. He’s perfectly willing to play a pounding Neu!-inspired Motorik beat on We Don’t Know What Tomorrow Brings, but more often you notice the stuff that divulges his jazz chops: the suppleness and slipperiness about his playing, the emphases that don’t always appear where your rock-trained ears expect them. Equally, it’s hard to avoid the feeling that, in the Smile, Greenwood and Yorke are allowing their prog rock tendencies full rein, unencumbered by band mates’ grumbling about sandals and flares. Greenwood’s guitar riffs are complex and knotty – there’s a particularly fantastic, percussive example driving Thin Thing – the time signatures are frequently lurching and awkward, the songs’ structures are uniformly episodic. “Don’t bore us, get to the chorus,” sings Yorke on Open the Floodgates, presumably in character as the kind of unconscionable simpleton who requires such artless baubles: there certainly aren’t any choruses here.  There are, occasionally, beautiful melodies (Free in the Knowledge definitely has one amid the acoustic guitars and synths softly wailing like distant sirens and, a little ironically, given that the gig seems to be sponsored by Spotify, it recalls the kind of thing Neil Young once might have written) but, at risk of sounding like said unconscionable simpleton, they’re often sketchy and meandering. What you remember about these songs aren’t the tunes, but the sounds and dynamics: the techno kick drum on The Same, which is programmed slightly out of kilter with the electronics so it appears to lurch drunkenly rather than tether the song; the woozy bed of analogue synthesiser drones on Speech Bubbles, the naggingly odd piano riff on opener Panavision. Elsewhere, there are notable similarities between what’s going on here and the sound Yorke and Greenwood make in their day job. Yorke’s voice, high and keening, is one of the most distinctive in rock; Radiohead’s latterday desire to meld rock and left-field electronica is much in evidence; the lyrical mood of the 14 songs they play is, well, very Radiohead, filled with dread and crushing but inevitable disappointment – “somebody is telling lies”, “what will become of us?”, “shame on you”, etc – emotions that one suspects have been sharpened by the fact these songs were formed during the Covid pandemic and the Boris Johnson administration. Free in the Knowledge even suggests revolution, albeit in that shaky, doubtful way familiar from Radiohead’s You and Whose Army? “When we get together, well then, who knows?” sings Yorke, but it doesn’t feel like a call to arms, more a distracted mutter. “OK I guess if you like this kind of thing,” offers Thin Thing. It’s far too harsh a judgment to say: well there’s the review written for you. Nevertheless, there’s certainly a grain of truth within it. It’s a performance that’s intriguing rather than dazzling, intermittently spellbinding, filled with fascinating ideas that don’t always coalesce.

1/31/2022,"A Holyrood politician who received death threats after she called for a more realistic debate about paedophiles has described how the experience prompted her to disclose her own abuse as a child. Speaking in detail for the first time since the row earlier this month, the Scottish National party MSP Karen Adam told the Guardian she was hurt by “the injustice of being called a ‘paedophile enabler’ when I’m actually a survivor of this myself. But it was a great cost to me personally, and I felt that my arm was twisted to do so.”  Adam, 46, who was elected last year, became embroiled in a fierce debate after responding to the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell. She wrote on Twitter: “Paedophiles and predators are people. Not bogeymen under the bed. Not Mac-wearing flashers in the street, faceless and nameless. They are our family, friends and colleagues.” On reflection, she concedes that amount of nuance is hard to put across in a tweet. “But in my experience, it is often the most unlikely, unsuspecting people around us who do these things and that’s how they manage to get away with it,” she said. “And that’s why it’s hard for children and young people to come forward because they feel nobody’s going to believe that uncle so-and-so has touched them inappropriately, because he’s a part of their family.” She said nothing had prepared her for the backlash that built through the early days of January. Alongside many who supported her point, brutally critical responses flooded in, describing her views as “shocking”, “degenerate” and branding her a “paedophile sympathiser”. She was told to kill herself and threatened with being “put through a wood chipper”. A Police Scotland investigation continues. “I felt heartsick,” she said. “It started to dawn on me that this was not accidental, that people were perhaps purposely misrepresenting my words.” Chris McEleny, an Inverclyde councillor and general secretary of Alex Salmond’s Alba party, responded that Adam’s view was proof that “the SNP has been captured by ideological zealots”. Alba, founded by the former first minister last spring before failing to secure any seats in the Holyrood election, issued a press release describing the tweet as “grotesque” and saying “to attempt to humanise the most vile behaviour in society is an appalling error in judgment”. McEleny later said he “rejected in the strongest possible way” any threats made to Adam and issued a plea to conduct political discussion online “in a much nicer way”. Adam claims abuse came from US-based Trump supporters, Tommy Robinson supporters and Alba supporters – as well as those advocating gender-critical viewpoints and British unionists. “They’re purposely misrepresenting my words for political gain and to support political movements. I’ve seen this before. The more open I am about my progressive views, the more I am called a pervert, or a predator enabler, for supporting trans rights, for supporting LGBT rights overall,” she said. The MSP for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, which covers parts of Aberdeenshire and Moray, had previously spoken in public about being the parent of a child who has experienced sexual abuse. “My daughter has been quite outspoken about her own experiences, and I always ask her permission before I discuss anything,” she said. She had never before disclosed her own abuse, even to close family members, but the ferocity of the backlash changed her mind. “I felt I had to disclose my own story to take the focus away from her,” she said. I’ve heard a tabloid has picked up on this tweet as a story.I myself am a survivor of child sexual assault. I have also been open about my experience as a mother of my daughters abuse at the hands of a family member. To anyone denying or dismissing the fact that these … 2/4 It was the first time her father knew what had happened. “It was overwhelming. I couldn’t eat. I felt so sick. I couldn’t sleep. My mind was buzzing at night-time. I had put it behind me and moved on. And now I’m confronted with it all again.” Adam’s experience might initially be dismissed as another flare-up of online outrage and political point-scoring. But the personal consequences have been real enough, and reveals some uncomfortable truths about the reality of being a woman in Holyrood, the pitfalls of social media and the weaponisation of certain subjects in an ongoing culture war. While she is grateful for the support she has received from colleagues across the chamber, Adam says being a woman in public life in Scotland in 2022 is “extremely difficult”. She said: “I’ve come across a lot of misogyny …I’m often infantilised, people question my decisions, even in regards to setting up my staff team. And this is just everyday stuff, without even getting to the abuse.” She added: “The most important email I received during this whole time was from a survivor who told me that they felt incredibly empowered because this was spoken about in a public sphere. You’re taught to feel shame and stigma and not talk about these things. It’s time for that to end.” In the UK, the NSPCC offers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

1/31/2022,"Dominic Cummings has said it is his “duty to get rid” of Boris Johnson as prime minister, describing it as “sort of like fixing the drains”. The prime minister’s former chief adviser called his former boss a “complete fuckwit” whose only preoccupations were “Big Ben’s bongs” and “looking at maps” to “order the building of things” in his honour.  Cummings, who has sent evidence to the Cabinet Office inquiry led by Sue Gray, said it was imperative Johnson was removed from office. Speaking to New York magazine, he called it “an unpleasant but necessary job” and said it was legitimate to remove a prime minister who had won a big election victory if they were not up to the job. Johnson is expected to be handed a heavily redacted version of the Sue Gray report into alleged breaches of lockdown rules in Downing Street early next week, as allies briefed over the weekend that an operation to save him from a vote of no confidence was winning round MPs. The prime minister is expected to travel to Ukraine on Tuesday and release the long-awaited levelling up white paper on Wednesday as a show of purpose to his restive MPs. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, one of those in contention to replace Johnson should he be forced out, said on Sunday Johnson was “absolutely” the best person to lead the Conservative party into the next general election. “There is no contest. There is no discussion,” she said. “He has achieved an 80-seat majority for the Conservative party. He has delivered on the Covid vaccine programme, the booster programme, he’s delivered on Brexit and he will do a fantastic job winning the next election for the Conservative party.” Johnson’s chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, was in the spotlight on Sunday as the Sunday Telegraph revealed he had been at the first day of the England v India Test at Lord’s on 12 August, three days before Taliban forces entered the Afghan capital. Rosenfield, along with the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, and Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, is among those expected to be criticised in the redacted version of Gray’s report – which the Metropolitan police have asked to be stripped of details of the most egregious alleged rule-breaking while a police investigation is carried out. Johnson has told angry MPs he will oversee a full clearout of the No 10 operation, which the Guardian understands could include a number of close allies of his wife, Carrie Johnson, who have had a power base in No 10 since the departure of Cummings and his associates. Cummings revealed one of the most damaging No 10 lockdown gatherings on his Substack, where Reynolds had emailed staff inviting them to drinks in the garden and to “bring your own booze”. Cummings has said Johnson was warned about the gathering, which the prime minister has admitted to attending but claims to have thought it was a work event. The former adviser told New York magazine Johnson was driven entirely by what would be in the papers the next day. “In January 2020 I was sitting in No 10 with Boris and the complete fuckwit is just babbling on about: ‘Will Big Ben bong for Brexit on 31 January?’” he said. Asked if it was fair that he was mounting a campaign to remove his former boss, Cummings said: “What’s fairness got to do with anything? It’s politics. All this is not fair. The fact that someone wins an election doesn’t mean that they should just stay there for years, right? If you’ve got a duffer, if you think someone can’t do the job, or is unfit for the job. “You know, as he said to me: ‘I’m the fucking king around here and I’m going to do what I want.’ That’s not OK. He’s not the king. He can’t do what he wants. Once you realise someone is operating like that then your duty is to get rid of them, not to just prop them up.” Cummings also told the magazine Johnson acted as if considering “what would a Roman emperor do? So, the only thing he was really interested in – genuinely excited about – was, like, looking at maps. Where could he order the building of things?” Cummings said Johnson fantasised about “monuments to him in an Augustine fashion”.",News/Politics,Dominic Cummings says it is his ‘duty to get rid’ of Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/30/dominic-cummings-says-it-is-his-duty-to-get-rid-of-boris-johnson
1/31/2022,"The only lingering question as Viktor Hovland celebrated a sixth tournament win in under two years was how Rory McIlroy was simultaneously taking out his frustration. McIlroy needed a birdie at the 72nd hole of the Dubai Desert Classic to claim the title for a record-equalling third time. Par would have been sufficient for the Northern Irishman to join Hovland and Richard Bland in a play-off. Instead, disaster and drama struck; McIlroy found water with his approach to the par five. After a bogey six consigned McIlroy to third, the four-times major winner was a picture of agony and anger as he made a speedy exit from the Emirates Club. It did not look a wise idea for anybody to get too close. McIlroy’s denouement will sting long beyond departure from the UAE.  Onlookers will speculate over whether McIlroy was correct to take on the last green from 260 yards. He had miraculously saved par from a bush on the previous hole, perhaps rendering a further dice with danger unwise. The counterpoints relate to McIlroy’s regular – and regularly successful – policy of being aggressive and that he was hardly planning to mis-hit a fairway wood. McIlroy did not become essential viewing by playing percentages. McIlroy knew as soon as his shot was airborne that it would find the pond that protects the 18th green. As a putt for par slid past, McIlroy knew his fate. Dubai has been good to McIlroy but it has also been the scene of the occasionally painful blow. Hovland had finished eagle-birdie to reach 12 under par. Bland, enjoying a career resurgence at 48, converted from 22ft at the 18th for the same aggregate. Yet McIlroy, playing further back in the field, had holes to spare and the trophy within his grasp. For the second time in the desert in little over two months – McIlroy was also in pole position to win the DP World Tour Championship – capitulation was to prove the theme. Hovland, the outstanding 24-year-old from Oslo, will rise to world No 3 after this triumph. He has the leading duo, Jon Rahm and Collin Morikawa, firmly in his sights. “I have quite a lot to prove to be able to beat those guys but this is a good start,” said the Norwegian. “It is very rewarding to see all the hard work paying off. I guess being No 3 is pretty crazy but that stuff can vary week-to-week. I’m not going to let that stuff dictate my mood or how I do things.” On the first replaying of the 18th, Bland lipped out from 6ft for a four. Hovland tapped in for precisely that after comfortably finding the putting surface in two. Having only turned professional in the summer of 2019, Hovland continues to provide cause for great European hope. Hovland’s 66 was the finest round of day four and five fewer than McIlroy. “I posted a good number to make it interesting for the guys behind me,” Hovland added. “I knew that I could post that good score today. I played some good golf this week but I didn’t quite get the same momentum that I did today.” Hovland’s eagle at the 17th came after he drove the green at the dog-leg par four, with his putt rolled in from 33ft. “I might make that putt one in 20 times,” he added. The quintet that shared fourth included Justin Harding, who led going into the final round, plus the English duo of Tyrrell Hatton and Sam Horsfield. Tommy Fleetwood, playing in the company of McIlroy and Harding, slipped to a 75 for a tie for 12th.

1/31/2022,"Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 10m cases and 140,000 deaths linked to the disease. The government figures below include confirmed cases only – some people who have the disease are not tested.  At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus’s impact before the centre of the virus shifted northwards. More recently, hotspots have developed again across the country, with London being hit earliest by the Omicron wave. Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March 2020, although national restrictions were relaxed in all four nations of the UK over the summer of 2021. Details of the English guidance are listed here, Scottish guidance here, Welsh guidance here and Northern Irish here. Cases in the UK first peaked in early April 2020, before falling in late spring and summer. After reaching a record level in January 2021, cases declined sharply. They remained high but stable after the latest lockdown release in July 2021, but have since surged with the arrival of the Omicron variant. The number of tests available affects the number of recorded cases. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus rose sharply after records started at the end of March 2020, peaking in April. That figure began rising again in September and reached a new record in January 2021. It is now at a relatively low level but is increasing steadily throughout winter 2021-22. Deaths surpassed their first-wave peak in January 2021, with daily deaths once again standing at over 1,000. As with hospitalisations, the number of deaths is now at a relatively low level, although there has been an increase over the autumn and winter. In this graph, deaths are counted as people who have died within 28 days of their first positive test. Counting everyone with Covid-19 listed as a cause on their death certificate results in a higher figure (see note below). Since mid-May 2021, cases have shot up at a rate comparable to the start of the second wave in autumn 2020. However, hospitalisations and deaths remain much lower than at the equivalent time during the second wave. Scientists say this is down to the protective effects of vaccines. Since UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December 2020, the UK’s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Until early July, hundreds of thousands of people were being vaccinated every day, although this then slowed down. The introduction of the booster campaign in October 2021 increased vaccine rollout once again. With first-dose vaccines open to over-12s in the UK from 20 October 2021, vaccines are available to everyone except younger children. However, in all age groups there is a persistent number of people who are not vaccinated. The lowest rates of vaccination are among younger age groups. While they were the last to be invited for vaccinations, there are concerns about vaccine hesitancy among younger people. The Covid-19 virus has mutated significantly since it first emerged. A small number of the variants have become “variants of concern” because they are more transmissible, more dangerous or evade vaccines more than the original virus. The Alpha variant that emerged at the end of 2020 was dominant in the UK until it was overtaken by Delta in spring 2021. Since Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization in November 2021, it has entered the UK and spread rapidly. Data in the chart below is based on sampling tests in England and compiled by the Sanger Institute. These numbers lag case data by several weeks. Lockdown had brought down case rates for everyone. But different age groups have been affected differently. Throughout the pandemic working-age people between 20 and 60 have had the highest levels of infection. This has become more stark since the vaccine rollout has protected many of the more vulnerable elderly people in society, with case rates rising among the younger groups while staying relatively low among older people. In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic. This data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. The government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means they are able to quickly capture deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread. The ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently. They count all deaths where Covid is on the death certificate. About 90% of these deaths are directly due to Covid while it is a contributory factor in the remaining deaths.

1/31/2022,"Like many of the irresistibly catchy pop songs it showcases, Sing 2 follows a tried and tested formula. Hapless koala bear promoter Buster Moon (Matthew McConaughey) must risk failure, humiliation and being chucked out of the window of a luxury hotel to put on a show. His animal stars (including two pigs, an elephant, a gorilla and a porcupine) overcome various obstacles to perform to a non-stop soundtrack of pop and rock bangers. What’s more, everything rests on luring a reclusive star – in this case Clay Calloway (Bono) – out of retirement. It’s a formula, after all, that made a considerable hit out of the first film, which was also written and directed by Garth Jennings. While there are no surprises whatsoever here, the perky charm remains.

1/31/2022,"Legislation to allow Britain to hit banks, energy companies and “oligarchs close to the Kremlin” with economic sanctions will be introduced by the government this week, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said. The scheme is the latest attempt by the UK to dissuade the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from launching an invasion of Ukraine, and was announced hours after Britain said it was willing to deploy more forces to Estonia and other Nato allies in eastern Europe.  “We’re going to be introducing new legislation so that we can hit targets including those who are key to the Kremlin’s continuation and the continuation of the Russian regime,” Truss told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme. “There will be severe costs on an invasion into Ukraine. And we would target Russian financial institutions, we would target energy companies, we will target oligarchs close to the Kremlin,” she added. Both the foreign secretary and the prime minister, Boris Johnson, are expected to visit Kyiv early this week, despite the pressure faced by Downing Street over the “partygate” scandal. A redacted version of Sue Gray’s report is expected to emerge on Monday. Foreign Office sources said Britain’s existing sanctions regime allowed the UK only to target those linked to the destabilisation of Ukraine; the new legislation will permit a wider targeting of the “strategic interests” of the Russian state. Any legislation will probably have to be sped through parliament as about 100,000 troops are massing in Russia and neighbouring Belarus, creating what Truss described as “a real threat of invasion”. The government has been accused of allowing Kremlin-linked money to flow easily through the City of London, and in some cases Russia-linked individuals donating to the ruling party. Last week, the Center for American Progress, a US thinktank close to the president, Joe Biden, warned that “uprooting Kremlin-linked oligarchs will be a challenge given the close ties between Russian money and the United Kingdom’s ruling Conservative party, the press, and its real estate and financial industry”. The thinktank proposed creating a joint US-UK working group to “prod stronger action from the UK government”. When asked about the thinktank report, Truss told the BBC: “We are doing more. We are introducing new legislation.” Britain, in conjunction with the US, has stepped up its rhetoric about the Russian threat to Ukraine, with London warning of a possible coup plot a week ago. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has talked down the risk, arguing that Kyiv has faced a constant military threat from Moscow since 2014. Russia denies it will invade, although the Kremlin said it was unhappy with the US response last week to its security demands. Moscow wants Ukraine never to be allowed to join Nato and has demanded a broad range of troop withdrawals from former Warsaw pact countries in eastern Europe. On Sunday, it emerged that Britain had offered to double its troop numbers in eastern Europe, where 900 lead a multinational battlegroup in Estonia and 150 in Poland, while Biden said Washington would deploy “not too many” additional forces – a few thousand at most – “in the near term”. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said on Sunday that combat troops would not move to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion. “We have no plans to deploy Nato combat troops to Ukraine,” he said, adding later: “There is a difference between being a Nato member and being a strong and highly valued partner as Ukraine.”",News/Politics,"UK to bring in measures to allow for tougher sanctions on Russia, says Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/30/liz-truss-says-uk-will-introduce-tougher-sanctions-on-russia-this-week
1/31/2022,"Atrue-life story that traces one woman’s tumultuous relationship with her serially unreliable father, Sean Penn’s Flag Day looks terrific. With its grainy, handheld camerawork and fondness for gloaming, magic-hour light, visually it feels like a cross between Terrence Malick’s Badlands and Barbara Loden’s Wanda. But the film, adapted by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth from a memoir by the journalist Jennifer Vogel, and starring Penn and his daughter, Dylan, makes heavy weather of the story at times. For all the bold stylistic decisions and visual energy, the actual storytelling tangles itself up in a convoluted, nonlinear structure, depleting some of the thrust and restlessness of the camerawork. Still, as forger, con artist and sometime bank robber John Vogel and his daughter Jennifer, the Penns give committed – and in Dylan’s case exposed – performances. Their real-life relationship brings authenticity to their scenes together; however, this fails to fully anchor some of the more showily histrionic moments.
