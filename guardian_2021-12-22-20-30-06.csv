12/22/2021,"The cost of abating the carbon impact of a proposed third runway at Heathrow has doubled since parliament approved the idea of expansion, a report presented to MPs suggests. A study by the New Economics Foundation suggests the carbon value or cleanup cost of the runway has increased from £50bn to £100bn, twice the figure presented to ministers and parliamentarians by the Department for Transport in the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) in 2018.  The “carbon value” of the expansion is the price of abatement required to offset the carbon emissions of the runway. This autumn the government revised carbon values to bring them into line with new legally binding net zero obligations, passed in June 2019. The report – presented to the all-party parliamentary group on Heathrow expansion and regional connectivity – suggests these changes have a significant impact on the proposed runway expansion. “In a climate emergency, any project or policy which creates new greenhouse gas emissions comes at great cost to society. Either we suffer the consequences of deeper ecological collapse, or someone, somewhere, has to ‘clean up’ those gases,” the report said. When a country, as the UK does, has a legal commitment to cut carbon emissions to zero, most options for reducing emissions and removing carbon from the atmosphere are already being utilised, the report said. “The cost, therefore, of cleaning up, or ‘abating’, new emissions, gets higher as your climate ambition rises,” the report said. In September a new set of costs of carbon abatement were released by the government. “Our calculations show that at Heathrow, the carbon cost of emissions resulting from the airport’s proposed expansion over the period 2025-2050 has doubled, from around £50bn, to over £100bn when considering the new government carbon values.” the report said. The change in costs impacts all proposed airport expansion. Across eight airports planning projects all have had their climate cost dramatically underestimated, NEF says. The research suggested cumulatively the eight active airport expansion plans come with an emissions price tag of £73.6bn between 2025 and 2050. Only a fraction of this, £11.8bn, is likely to be reclaimed in taxes on the aviation industry. The remainder, £62bn, will be a cost to government and represent “a colossal subsidy to polluting industry, and significant cost – either economic, environmental, or both – to the rest of society,” the report said. David Simmonds MP, co-chair of the APPG, said: “This report highlights the need to get the detail right when considering our future aviation picture and the government’s Jet Zero review. “We cannot afford to underestimate the implications for major projects such as Heathrow expansion and future generations will not thank us for creating complicated financial mechanisms which won’t do anything to actually help the environment.” Paul McGuinness, chair of the No 3rd Runway Coalition, said: “As was perhaps inevitable, Heathrow expansion’s carbon costs have escalated exponentially, even before they’ve put more greenhouse gas emitting planes into our atmosphere. The ever-growing case for the government to cancel Heathrow expansion has become incontrovertible.” When MPs voted for the Airline National Policy Statement, which contained the expansion in principle in 2018, the net economic value of it was between £3bn and -£2.5bn, he said. Now the carbon abatement cost element of Heathrow expansion have increased exponentially, the total economic impact of the scheme can now only come at a great cost to the UK economy, said McGuinness. Lord Deben, chair of the Climate Change Committee, which advises government, said last month: “There is not any space for airport expansion”. The CCC recommends “no net expansion of UK airport capacity unless the sector is on track to sufficiently outperform its net emissions trajectory and can accommodate the additional demand”. A Heathrow spokesperson said: “Reducing carbon emissions from flying has always been a central consideration of our plans to expand Heathrow. “We have always known that we will have to prove that a new runway is compatible with the UK’s net zero target. While our current focus remains on responding to the pandemic, we remain confident that we can expand and meet stringent targets. “The UK aviation sector was the first in the world to commit to net zero and publish a detailed plan to get there. The recent commitment by the whole global aviation sector to net zero and the UK government’s ambition for 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030 are clear steps towards taking the carbon out of flying, even as we grow.”",News/Environment,"Cleanup cost of Heathrow third runway doubles to £100bn, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/22/cleanup-cost-of-heathrow-third-runway-doubles-to-100bn-mps-told
12/22/2021,"Voting rights are under assault by Republican state lawmakers, clearly afraid of the power of the Black electorate and empowered by the gutting of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act. The federal response, or lack thereof, will affect not only Black voters but the power of all Americans to shape our government with our votes. Endemic racism obscures the obvious: an attack on Black voters is an attack on the foundation of our democracy. With two voting rights bills held hostage in the US Senate by threat of a Republican filibuster, Democrats are not fighting back with the same vigor that Republicans have used to trample on the rights of voters. A failure of US Senate Democrats to move on the passage of voting rights will ultimately be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If they fail to secure rights for the voters who put them into office, their base for the midterm elections will shrink and open a path for a Republican takeover in 2022.  However, Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, recently pointed out in a speech on the Senate floor that when the will is there, Congress changes its rules to allow legislation to pass. He noted that the Senate recently enabled a vote on raising the national debt ceiling to prevent a default on government financial obligations and uphold the full faith and credit of the US government. Warnock shone a light on the hypocrisy of changing Senate procedure for financial legislation but not to combat the suppression of Black voters. “We’ve decided we must do it for the economy, but not for the democracy,” he said, pointing out that Democrats are hiding behind technicalities to avoid an ugly confrontation. But racism cloaked in the relic of the filibuster cannot prevail over our hard-won right to shape our democracy. Since Black voters showed up in record numbers in the 2020 election, trying to save a democracy that has not always protected us, the political backlash from Republican state houses has echoed throughout 2021. The result is that Black voters have less protection today than we had at this time last year. Yet Joe Biden and a Democratic Congress have not used the power that Black voters secured for them to protect our rights. They have expended their political capital on the infrastructure and Build Back Better bills, when the basis of democracy should be their most urgent priority. The failure of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to pass in a Democratic Congress shows the lengths to which Republicans will go to keep Black voters away from the polls. Yet even without federal voting protection, in the 2021 “off-year” elections, Black people came out in strong numbers to prevail in local elections throughout the south. Black Voters Matter (BVM) has been in the streets, on the phones and connecting with our partners to mobilize for elections, showing that there is no off-year when it comes to voting. In the recent November races for city council, mayor and the statehouse of representatives throughout Georgia, where new state laws have taken direct aim at the Black electorate, we mobilized Black voters to make our voices heard. With on-the-ground canvassing and voter outreach caravans, we turned out Black voters in Warner Robins, Georgia, for a crucial city council race. Our texting and phone banking campaigns in Hinds County, Mississippi, helped to secure a major victory in a local judge’s race. And this summer, on our Freedom Ride for Voting Rights, we started mobilizing Black voters from New Orleans to Washington DC months before important local elections took shape. And our movement is still gaining momentum. Last week, as the president convened leaders from around the world for his Global Democracy Summit, BVM partnered with local and national advocacy organizations on coordinated voting rights actions across the country to point out the administration’s hypocrisy. Holding a global summit on democracy is a slap in the face to the millions of citizens in Biden’s own backyard who still face significant obstacles to the polls. In response, we held nearly a dozen events nationwide, including a student hunger strike led by Un-Pac Arizona, calling on Biden and the Senate to pass voting rights legislation before Congress goes into holiday recess. Actions also took place in California, Delaware, Georgia, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Virginia and Washington DC. Basic civil rights do not take a holiday, so neither should those entrusted to safeguard those rights. We will continue to push and build a movement to demand #RightsBeforeRecess. Voting rights is not just about election day; it’s a 365-day mission. We have responded to attempts to block us from the ballot with more community organizing, more education, more outreach and even more energy. And it’s now time for congressional Democrats to respond by clearing the way to pass laws that protect not only Black voters but the rights and freedoms of all of us.

12/22/2021,"It happened overnight. Larry Ryerson, 78, woke up on a Sunday morning in late June in Medford, southern Oregon, to find thousands of seedlings on his 10-acre Christmas tree farm dying.Their bright green coloring had drained away after a day of triple digit temperatures. And over the next two days, as temperatures climbed as high as 115F, Ryerson watched the young trees, many just over a foot tall, turn brown and die.“It just kind of breaks your heart that you go out there and one day they’re nice fresh-looking trees, and the next day, they’re wilted and turning colors,” said Ryerson, who co-owns U Cut Christmas Tree Farm with his sister. “And there’s nothing you can do about it.”Ryerson estimated that he lost 4,500 trees and was only able to keep his u-cut open for three days this year because of the lack of inventory. His business, which has been around for almost four decades, typically opens around Thanksgiving and continues to sell all the way through Christmas Day.  “I just feel so sorry that a lot of people come up here year after year to get their own tree and we’re one of the few tree farms left in the valley,” he said.Ryerson isn’t alone. Christmas tree farms across Oregon, the nation’s largest producer, have found themselves in a precarious position after a year of extreme weather. A deadly “heat dome” pummeled the Pacific northwest beginning in late June, shattering heat records in Oregon and the surrounding area, and a drought engulfed the state for months. The heat and drought are estimated to have wiped out millions of trees across the state, most of them seedlings, leaving farmers to navigate the fallout of what several described as the worst summer in memory. Some, like Ryerson’s farm, saw huge swaths of their crops destroyed, while others were left with rows and rows of trees with entire sides scalded or new growth withered.And with the changing climate, this will not be the last year of extreme weather. Now, some Christmas tree farmers across the state have started taking steps to prepare for a future in which the climate may be much less hospitable to their industry. Tom Norby, the president of the Oregon Christmas Tree Growers Association and owner of the Trout Creek Tree Farm, says such changes could include planting cover crops, or experimenting with growing types of trees more resistant to the heating climate. Norby’s own farm had minimal loss this past year, which he attributed to planting grass between each of his trees, which helped to keep moisture in the soil and block heat from radiating up to the trees. But some changes may have to be more dramatic, such as planting months earlier, or even relocating farms farther north.“Frankly,” said Norby, “in 100 years, it may be in British Columbia.” This past summer, it was the timing of the heatwave that made it especially lethal. It struck early in the summer, mere months after seedlings were planted and right in the middle of the crop’s peak growth period.At the same time, prolonged dry periods, which have become increasingly common in the region, were already making seedling survival a challenge (Christmas tree farms typically don’t irrigate, due to their location and the fact that the trees normally haven’t needed it). Dana Furrow, co-owner of Furrow Farm in Hillsboro, Oregon, which includes an 80-acre Christmas tree farm, said when the temperatures pushed well past 100F in June, they had only planted their seedlings weeks before, when the climate was already dry. By the time the heatwave hit, her crops were in the midst of early growth – a very sensitive period. The result was the farm lost thousands of seedlings, along with virtually all of its harvestable, u-cut Noble fir trees. “It definitely hurts because you’ve already put the cost of the seedlings, the labor, the time, working the fields. I mean it’s a lot,” she said. “Christmas trees are a very labor-intensive crop. So, you lose all of that and you don’t get that back.” Noble Mountain Tree Farm, a wholesale grower in Salem with about 4,000 acres and more than half a million trees in sales every year, lost about 280,000 seedlings, according to Bob Schaefer, its general manager. At the same time, more than a quarter of its primary species, Noble fir trees, were rendered unsalable this year. He said that they’re looking at having to do a lot of replanting and additional fertilizing in an effort to help the new trees catch up to the other seedlings. For this season, they’ve had to give their retailers the option of either receiving fewer trees or taking other species. Overall, the impact on consumers has been fairly minor. Some businesses have priced their trees slightly higher, while others haven’t been able to offer the variety of species they have in years past. Norby estimated that inventory was down by 5% to 10% across the state, but clarified that there was no Christmas tree shortage.“You want a Christmas tree, they’re out there,” he said. “But, you know, here’s the thing, we should be embracing Christmas tree growers. And what you might get is a slightly damaged tree, you know, a tree that’s expressing some of the signs of this global warming event.”The real impact might not be felt for years to come, according to Chal Landgren, Oregon State University Extension Christmas tree specialist. He cited the fact that most of the damage was on seedlings (Christmas trees take six to 10 years to mature).“We’re going to just have to watch, you know, we’ll know when that date gets closer. But there’s gonna be this kind of gap from the damage from this year, in eight years,” he said.Ryerson has already started to make changes to his farm in Medford, after the heatwave. In October, they planted a fresh batch of seedlings – months earlier than normal – in hopes that the rain would help their root systems. He has also started looking around for additional nutrients that might help to protect his crops.But after this year’s devastation and watching his house and some of his trees burn down in 2019, those changes may simply not be enough. “If I have another year like this year, I probably have to go out of business,” he said, “just because you work so hard to get them grown and all of a sudden they die – well, what’s the point?”",News/US news,The crisis unfolding in America’s Christmas tree capital,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/christmas-tree-crisis-unfolding-oregon
12/22/2021,"There is a brisk trade in reboots right now, but it can be a tricky concept to master. The past few months alone have seen the return of Dexter, Sex and the City and Gossip Girl, while next year promises new True Blood, Fresh Prince of Bel Air and Frasier. But for every Doctor Who or Queer Eye, in which a reboot becomes a reimagining, there’s a Gilmore Girls or, and I shudder at the memory, Supermarket Sweep. To get attention for reviving a classic is easy; to do it well is very hard indeed. Happily, The Wonder Years (Disney+) has been done with care and innovation, and taps into the nostalgic appeal of the original late 80s/early 90s sitcom, while carving out a new path. The original Wonder Years began in 1988 with a character called Kevin looking back on his glorious 1960s youth. This time, the story centres on the Williams family, and their life in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1968. Don Cheadle narrates as the adult Dean; young Dean is played by Elisha Williams, who is so good that he makes me question whether my preconceptions about child actors might be unfair, after all.  Several reviews in the US have pointed out that if this employed a similar timeline as the original, we would be watching Dean look back wistfully at the 00s. I love a low-rise bootcut jean and a belly button piercing as much as anyone, but the 60s setting is far more handsome, and provides a social and cultural backdrop that nudges this above the usual sitcom fare. The Williams are a black family, which makes the prospect of a series that leans heavily on nostalgia far more interesting; the rose-tinted glasses through which a 12-year-old white boy might look at his youth in suburban Anytown are clearly going to be different from those of a 12-year-old black child in Alabama. Within moments, older Dean has set his middle-class family’s life in context: his father had already given him “the police talk” about how to behave around cops, politicians are exploiting racial divisions on a national stage, and white flight is taking white families out of the city centres. Dean’s older sister, Kim, wears a Black Panthers T-shirt and references Bobby Seale, co-founder and activist. The school system has only recently been desegregated, and in the first episode Dean, or “Black Jesus”, as his friend teases, decides to be “the great unifier”, pushing for his baseball team to play a team of white kids. Dean is an awkward, precocious child who is shorter than his best friend and is ashamed to wear thick glasses. He goes through the trials and tribulations that most adolescents are forced to endure. This is about education, bullying, friendship, first love, family and riding a bike moodily around town – and for the most part, it is delightful. Dean is in love with Keisa (Milan Ray), a tough girl who borrows his comic books. His older brother, Bruce, is fighting in Vietnam; Kim is finding her own political identity. As the youngest, he says, “all the good parts have been handed out”. All that’s left for Dean is to work out where he fits in or, perhaps more accurately, where it’s OK not to fit in. He calls himself “sheep number three”. Crucially, it’s funny, and has a winning, easy charm. It feels like the kind of comedy that trusts its audience with smart jokes. The humour is divided between young Dean’s wide-eyed wonder and youthful sensitivities, and the older Dean’s knowledge, as narrator, that when you are 12, the trivial stuff can seem insurmountable, and the things that really matter might fade into the background. It realises that viewers can handle the big ideas with the smaller ones, often at the same time. The test for any reboot is whether there is a point to it. Has it done something new with the name, rather than coasting on brand recognition? The answer, in this case, is an emphatic yes. It would have been simpler to have made another nostalgia-loving period piece, which doesn’t examine the idea in any meaningful way; instead, it balances its plates with care.

12/22/2021,"Texas officials have quietly restarted a controversial program to ask people on the voter rolls to prove their citizenship, sparking alarm that thousands of eligible voters could be wrongfully targeted.  The Texas secretary of state’s office has identified just under 12,000 people it suspects of being non-citizens since September, when the program restarted (there are more than 17 million registered voters in Texas). About 2,327 voter registrations have been cancelled so far. The vast majority of cancellations were because voters failed to respond to a notice giving them 30 days to prove their citizenship. The secretary of state flags anyone as a suspected non-citizen if they register to vote and then subsequently visit the Texas department of public safety (DPS), the state’s driver’s license agency, and indicates they are not a citizen. Local election officials in Texas’ 254 counties are then asked to review the names. If those officials cannot verify citizenship, they are required to send them a letter asking them to prove their citizenship within 30 days or else their voter registration gets cancelled. But election officials in Harris county, the most populous in the state, are concerned about the accuracy of the data being used to challenge voters. After the county mailed proof of citizenship requests to 2,796 people, 167 voters - nearly 6% of those contacted – responded with proof of citizenship. The state removed an additional 161 people from the list of people whose citizenship needed to be verified, according to a county official. “We are not confident in the quality of the information we are being mandated to act upon,” Isabel Longoria, the county’s election administrator, said in an email. In Fort Bend county, just outside of Houston, officials mailed notices to 515 people in October. About 20% responded with proof of citizenship and the rest were removed from the rolls, according to John Oldham, the county’s election administrator. Many of the people who responded said they had accidentally checked a box during their DPS transaction indicating they were not citizens, Oldham said. In Cameron county, along the US-Mexico border, election officials have sent out 246 letter since September, almost all to people with Hispanic surnames, according to the Texas Monthly, which first reported the program restarted. About 60 people have been cancelled so far. After the notices went out, a married couple who had heard about the notices came into the elections office to provide their naturalization papers, even though the couple’s citizenship wasn’t challenged, said Remi Garza, the county elections administrator. “It saddened me too,” Garza said. “People who shouldn’t have to be concerned about this type of proving citizenship felt that the had to do that.” Voting rights groups say they are trying to better understand the process the state is using, but are concerned eligible voters are getting targeted. “​​A US citizen voter who gets a challenge letter is understandably intimidated. And especially for naturalized US citizens, who went through an entire bureaucratic process to be able to vote, getting a letter that accuses them of being an ineligible voter is particularly intimidating,” said Nina Perales, an attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. “People will naturally assume, based on this official correspondence, that they might have made some kind of mistake, or that they are not proper voters.” The program had been on hold since 2019, when a federal judge ordered Texas to stop a similar, error-filled, effort that he described as “ham-handed”. As part of a settlement in that case, Texas agreed to only flag people if they registered to vote prior to the DPS visit in which they indicated they weren’t a citizen. It also agreed to reinstate and challenge voters who provided proof of citizenship, even if it was outside the 30-day window. The citizenship check comes as Republicans have moved to blunt the rapidly growing political power of Texas’ non-white population. Texas prosecutors have sought criminal punishments for people, including non-citizens, who make voting mistakes and the attorney general, Ken Paxton, has zealously pursued claims of voter fraud, which is exceedingly rare in Texas and elsewhere. Bruce Elfant, whose office oversees voter registration in Travis county, said his office so far has internally been able to confirm that less than 100 of the 300 to 400 people flagged by the secretary of state’s office were citizens. Most in the group had been flagged because of clerical errors, he said. His office has not yet sent out any challenge notices and is waiting for more information before it does so. In El Paso county, state officials referred 4,000 suspected non-citizens for review, and around 300 had already offered proof of citizenship, said Lisa Wise, the county’s election administrator. The county isn’t currently cancelling the registration of any voter who doesn’t respond, she said. Federal law prohibits officials from conducting mass voter cancellations within 90 days of a primary election. Texas’ primary is on 1 March, so the state can’t remove anyone who doesn’t respond to a proof of citizenship letter until later this spring. Thomas Buser-Clancy, a senior staff attorney with the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said his organization was trying to understand why eligible voters were being flagged, but it was clear “something is not going right”. “Even if your system flags one eligible voter and threatens to remove them, that’s a problem,” he said. “If you have hundreds, and if you add it up across counties, you’re probably getting to thousands of eligible voters, being threatened with removal.” Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas secretary of state’s office said he was confident in the data. “We’re following the settlement agreement exactly as we’re supposed to. If the counties have additional information where they’re able to cross people off the list who have in fact become citizens and they’re lawfully registered to vote, that’s great. That’s how the process is supposed to work.” But Buser-Clancy noted that those who were able to affirm their citizenship likely only represented a fraction of the eligible voters who were probably affected. “Those people are the lucky ones that both received the notice, like actually went through their mail, looked it up, and had the documentation on hand to send in,” he added. “What that tells you is that there’s some other percentage of people who are going to be removed from the rolls even though they’re eligible voters.”",News/US news,Alarm as Texas quietly restarts controversial voting program,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/texas-voting-program-voter-rolls-citizenship
12/22/2021,"Who doesn’t love a good holiday-season ritual? Weeping through the end credits of Scrooged. Sousing mince pies with brandy cream, and eating them for breakfast. Staying up late on Christmas Day so you can follow the start of the Boxing Day Test, even though England are already two down in the series and you’ve started to remember why the Ashes is cricket’s most consistently overrated contest. It’s such a comfort, in our turbulent modern times, to have these traditions to cling to. If there’s a spectre at the feast, a fly in the eggnog, a potential choking hazard in the plum pudding, is only the sense that a team with England’s considerable resources ought to be putting up a better fight than this. After all, they’re not not just letting themselves and their fans down. Think of the Australian team, who have been waiting all year for a chance to prove themselves after losing to India. Beating this England side isn’t going to prove anything.  Still, it’s all part of the routine: that frustrating feeling that England really ought to have a chance this time, that Australia aren’t the force they appear to be. One more stop on our four-yearly tram-ride around the ’burbs of Ashes nostalgia. This tour is already trying its hardest to plagiarise its predecessors: the past two Tests have riffed on Ashes infamy and strung a series of England’s greatest hits into the sporting equivalent of a jukebox musical. To open the show, an embarrassing error on the very first ball of the series that sets the tone and presages England’s ultimate doom. We’ll have Rory Burns perform that one. And why not have England show up at the Gabba Test with an underpowered bowling attack? Hmm, trickier. We’d have to convince them to leave out their two best seam… oh wait, they have. It’s not all straight from Now-That’s-What-I-Call-The-2000s. There have been plenty of throwbacks to earlier periods, too. After their abject first innings in Brisbane, England let 10 for one become 166 for one. Then, having briefly fought back and ripped the guts out of the middle order, they watched Travis Head and the tail disport themselves to the tune of nearly 200 runs. If that scenario is giving you flashbacks, you clearly lived through the Steve Waugh/Ian Healy era. As for the state of the batting, well, that one’s a golden oldie. Behold, the instantly collapsible travel XI, precariously propped up by a stoic, heroic captain. Anyone over 30 can hum along to that one, because they’re playing Michael Atherton’s song. Although to be fair, even Atherton was doing a cover version of Graham Gooch at the time. There have been any number of episodes, in recent years, that have caused the more experienced England fan to complain that it’s like the bloody 1990s all over again. This, of course, is nonsense. At no stage did a 90s team contain England’s greatest wicket-taker of all time, or an all-rounder capable of emulating and even exceeding the legend of Ian Botham. It didn’t have a batter who averaged over 40 in Tests, let alone 50. But of course, these facts only make the failure of the current crop all the sadder and more infuriating. James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Mark Wood, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, and even the Secret Santa gift of Ollie Robinson: you could argue it’s the strongest pace attack England have taken to Australia in 30 years, including the one that won in 2010-11. And yet England’s incomprehensibly erratic fielding – not to mention poor bowling strategy and an overthought, overwrought selection policy – have had them firing blanks. One reason why the spirit of the 90s is being evinced in this instance is that the pattern of defeat is so painfully familiar. England have shown spine only when it’s quite literally too late to affect the outcome of the game. Joe Root and Dawid Malan’s century stands, in both games, offered escape from embarrassment, but not from jail, and as for the beautiful but fantastical hope that Jos Buttler might pull off the mother of all miracle draws in Adelaide … well, this is a time of multiple religious celebrations, so it feels wrong to cast shade on anyone’s belief system. Let’s all agree to keep our faith in Father Christmas for now. Which brings us back to England’s record in Australia, and the idea that an Ashes tour is one of the greatest sporting shows on earth. If you exclude the Victorian vanity trips that England dominated before Australia had a serious domestic structure of their own, then since the start of the 20th century England have played 145 Tests in Australia, losing 77 of them, winning 43 and drawing 25. Of the nine Ashes series they’ve won away from home – for comparison, they’ve lost 17 – only one has come since 1990. This edition of the Ashes and England’s performances in it are not helping the creeping fear that the rivalry itself might be gradually evolving into self-parody. England teams heading to the not-so-holy land to hunt for the lost grail do not habitually inspire epic sagas of derring-do. We distract from the one-sidedness of the clash with self-mythologising spin-offs, like Michael Clarke and his broken fuckin’ sledging, or Jonny Bairstow not-quite-head-butting Cameron Bancroft. There are, of course, still three Tests to play, three opportunities for this series to prove all of the above utterly wrong. England will need to find both Christmas magic and New Year fireworks to stop this story feeling very familiar indeed.  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

12/22/2021,"If the pandemic has proved anything, it’s that the essence of what it means to be a good leader is changing. Donald Trump might not like it, but the alpha, chest-bumping style of management seems to be leaving the building. In its place is a softer, more empathetic type of leadership, defined by honesty and clear communication styles. Its appeal has increased over the past two years – think the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern showing compassion and providing clear communication or Gareth Southgate demonstrating humility and emotional intelligence. And not forgetting the myriad managers across the globe who have continually checked in on their staff during the pandemic.  These are all attributes that students and graduates could be fine-tuning right now. Jim Moser, director of professional development at The University of Law explains how. Become a compassionate CEO“Businesses are increasingly adopting softer, empathetic styles of leadership that seek to answer the concerns of employees and the public. Covid has accelerated this. But it’s not just a matter of appearing to be kind; you’ve actually got to care, which can be challenging for some bosses.” Leaders are accountable like never before“Another byproduct of Covid is the great resignation, where people have reflected on their jobs and sought to change them [millions worldwide are quitting; in the UK, a quarter of workers plan to change jobs in the next few months, according to a survey by the recruitment company Randstad UK]. Because of this, bosses can’t force people to go back to the office, because employees will simply leave and go somewhere that offers them the flexible working they’re after. “Today, people have a different relationship with their bosses than 50 years ago. There’s less deference, and while bosses have always kept an eye on staff, the advent of the internet and social media means leaders are under scrutiny from employees, too. “What does this all mean? Well, not only do today’s leaders need to ensure the wellbeing of their staff, but they also need to invest more trust in them. The idea that workers can only be productive when a boss is watching over their shoulders has gone.” Be an advocate for causes you feel strongly about“The more progressive organisations are increasingly giving a forum to workers to advocate issues and topics they feel strongly about – such as LGBTQ+ rights. Think what the important issues likely to affect your sector in years to come might be. Is there anything people in your organisation need training in, such as greater diversity and inclusion? If you take a stance, it could play well for your future career.” Own up to your mistakes“Leaders should lead by example. Be honest about your mistakes. If you’ve messed something up, people will respect you more for saying so, rather than not. As a leader, you must set a culture where people confess to their failures and learn from them.” Throw compliments around like confetti“Today, people expect to receive feedback. So, if somebody has completed some good work, tell them about it. It’s one of the best ways to ensure your team is enthusiastic and productive.” Don’t be mates with your staff“Think about what a friendship [with your staff] would do to your role. Will you treat other staff less favourably because they’re not your friends? Will you be able to judge things correctly if your friend commits an error? Friendships make leaders’ jobs more difficult – you need to be able to differentiate.” Be an inclusive leader“Surround yourself with people from different backgrounds. Recruiting people on the same path is a hopeless hiring strategy, and will stop you from reaping the benefits of having fresh ideas coming from different sources. “Businesses of the future will need a mixture of people: graduates from different disciplines, non-graduates, creative workers, entrepreneurial people and analytic staff. It will be difficult for any business to survive without these people.” Ensure there’s a sense of yin and yang between you and your deputy“Leaders should examine their own insecurities. If you know you’re not particularly creative, you should accept that and consider employing others who can deal with the creative aspects of the business. Look at Richard Branson – he’s an amiable, driven personality, but has always hired more conventional business types because they complemented his other skills. Likewise, you’ll often find advertising businesses with a CEO who’s good with the financial side of things, but surrounds themselves with creatives who really influence what’s going on.” Don’t neglect the other factors needed for success“The leaders that get to the top achieve it because they’ve got dedication, have a strong work ethic and are good at what they do. Don’t forget that luck can also play a role, but it’ll be your ability, hard work and honesty that will enable you to reflect and make good decisions, and ultimately make you a good leader.” Find out how The University of Law could open the door to a whole range of exciting careers",A new career with The University of Law,Leadership 101: nine skills you need to be a successful – and compassionate – boss,https://www.theguardian.com/a-new-career-with-the-university-of-law/2021/dec/22/leadership-101-nine-skills-you-need-to-be-a-successful-and-compassionate-boss
12/22/2021,"For Josh Lewsey, winning at sport is comparatively simple. It’s winning at business that’s more of a challenge. “When you work in a sports environment the currency of performance is pretty straightforward. You compete on tries, goals or such like in order to win or lose.” However, “businesses are more complex, multidimensional environments with many factors and potentially [different] agendas that may have differing opinions of what constitutes performance and success”. Therefore trying to succeed at business can be a bit like “playing a game on a pitch that changes shape”.  Lewsey may be one of the few people truly qualified to make this comparison.His name and face will already be familiar to rugby union fans from his days as a Wasp and a member of England’s winning World Cup team in 2003. Less well-known, but no less impressive, is his success off the field. By 2009, when he quit professional rugby and joined PwC as a management consultant, he’d already graduated from Bristol University, completed a postgraduate diploma in law and been commissioned as a British army officer. Also an INSEAD business school alumnus and possessing an executive MBA from Imperial College London, he’s now located in Hong Kong. After almost five years as a strategy and transactions partner with EY-Parthenon, he’s recently been appointed CEO of Teneo Value+ in Asia-Pacific and also professor of leadership at The University of Law Business School. It might seem incongruous to have had two seemingly contrasting careers but, in fact, Lewsey sees his past as being in the pursuit of a single goal: “I now see there’s been just one spine through my life. From competing against my brothers, to playing sports, being in the military and then business – it’s the idea of ‘leading performance’.” Rather than being completely different worlds, he feels that leadership in sport, the military and business exists on a “fluid spectrum”, and whilst having differing languages and currency of performance, he draws on these experiences and considers the mindset similar. “I’ve been around some amazing and, indeed, some rather ineffective leaders in my life – in some successful environments and some unsuccessful ones. It’s all about learning from those ups and downs, so you can take an organisation, formulate a coherent strategy and then execute effectively.” His current role at Teneo Value+ involves working with private capital investors and company CEOs to create value by identifying opportunities, financially quantifying these and executing against them. While opportunities differ for each client, he finds the problem in optimising value often lies in misalignment or a lack of multidisciplinary skills. “Many business schools develop people for finance, operations or other such technical verticals but when you get to be a CEO, the skills you require all come together. I see many CVs where graduates are super bright, with amazing technical skills in one dimension, but they often lack the ability to apply a holistic lens to problem solving, or aren’t able to see a company from a rounded perspective,” says Lewsey. That’s where his work with The University of Law comes in. He hopes his role will help students understand the need for a cross-disciplinary approach earlier in their careers. “The University of Law is in a unique place because it has corporate governance at the heart of what it does, which pulls together a range of skills – leadership, strategy and financial performance for example – that are only usually brought together in the position of the CEO. So making sure the university builds its criteria and curriculum to develop this is really important, not just in terms of optimising a company’s short-term performance but also in factoring in governance for longer-term value creation.” Lewsey, whose mother was a teacher and whose father came from an agricultural background, feels fortunate that he’s been able to channel his talents into the competitive world of global finance. “A grammar school boy, I had no clue when I left school,” he says. It was his professional rugby career that freed him up to study subjects that interested him. “You only play 80 minutes of rugby a week, so the rest of the time you can play PlayStation, or you can do other things,” he says. “I always enjoyed learning although there wasn’t an end stage in my mind at that time.” As he’d gone to the University of Bristol on a military bursary, in the first few years as a graduate this extra time was focused on his army training and then a two-year military commission. Later, it included establishing a leadership development company and capital markets investing as well as the further education that led him to find a passion in organisational performance. Having discovered his niche, he’s particularly excited to be shaping tomorrow’s business leaders. “In the future, the what and the why may stay the same, but the how is changing: through digitisation, working from home and different ways of working. As this evolves, it’s important that the leaders of tomorrow have rounded skill sets so they can lead across cultures, geographies, languages, jurisdictions – motivating disparate individuals to a common aim.” The leaders of the future will be able to take inspiration from Lewsey’s story – one of hard work and perseverance. His advice for the next generation: “Be long-term, rather than short-term, greedy. There’s no fast-track to being as good as you can be, but you’ll get there eventually if you work hard enough.” Find out how The University of Law could open the door to a whole range of exciting careers",A new career with The University of Law,From the pitch to the boardroom: how rugby star Josh Lewsey is competing in a whole new field ,https://www.theguardian.com/a-new-career-with-the-university-of-law/2021/dec/22/from-the-pitch-to-the-boardroom-how-rugby-star-josh-lewsey-is-competing-in-a-whole-new-field
12/22/2021,"Half a billion free at-home coronavirus tests will be sent to the American public in the fight against Omicron, Joe Biden announced yesterday while pushing back against resistance to vaccine mandates by saying they are intended “not to control your life but to save your life”. The president, whose address was intended to rally the troops for the latest Covid battle, began with his signature empathy card. “I want to start by acknowledging how tired, worried and frustrated I know you are. I know how you’re feeling. For many of you, this will be the first or even the second Christmas where you look – across the table will be an empty kitchen chair there.”  But then came the Churchillian appeal for stiff upper lips: “While Covid has been a tough adversary, we’ve shown that we’re tougher – tougher because we have the power of science and vaccines that prevent illness and save lives, and tougher because of our resolve.” Should Americans celebrate Christmas as normal? Biden said unvaccinated people have good reason to be concerned, but those who have been vaccinated should celebrate Christmas as planned. The case of a young Colorado truck driver sentenced to 110 years in prison over his role in a fatal collision has prompted widespread calls for leniency and fueled criticism of the US justice system. Yesterday, the Colorado district attorney whose office prosecuted the case asked the court to reconsider the sentence of Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, after the backlash over a punishment that has been called unduly harsh. Aguilera-Mederos was convicted in October of vehicular homicide and other charges related to a deadly crash in April 2019. He has said he was descending a steep portion of the highway when the brakes on his semi-trailer failed, leading to a multi-vehicle pileup and four deaths. More than 4.5 million people have signed a petition calling for Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, to grant clemency or commute his sentence. Meanwhile, truckers and civil rights groups have expressed outrage over the sentence. Why did he get such a long sentence? The judge in the case has said he had to give Aguilera-Mederos the lengthy sentence based on minimum sentencing laws for the charges, prompting further criticism of the criminal justice system. The holiday season at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, America’s busiest shipping complex, has always been hectic. But 2021 is a year unlike any other. A pandemic-induced buying boom and supply chain crisis led to an unprecedented backlog of ships lingering offshore and towering stacks of colorful containers clogging the entirety of the dockyard. Inside the port, thousands of workers are laboring around the clock to unload these containers one by one, sending the televisions, bicycles, medical supplies and more that they contain out to trains and waiting truckers, whose rigs stretch into nearby residential neighborhoods. The goods eventually make their way to warehouses and stores and into the arms of eager consumers. “It’s like being on a freeway in traffic,” Danny Miranda, the president of ​​ILWU Local 94, the union that represents dockworkers, said of the port complex. “There’s nowhere to go. Every space is being utilized.” What’s behind the congestion? Climbing consumer sales, worker shortages and the slowdown of major transportation hubs during the pandemic created a crisis in the global supply chain and have led to increasing costs and shortages of goods and containers. Twenty-five years after JonBenét Ramsey was killed, police say DNA has not been ruled out as a means to help solve the case. The six-year-old was found dead in the basement of her family’s Boulder, Colorado, home on 26 December 1996. The case became one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States. An advertising technology billionaire has resigned his membership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and rebuked the faith over social issues and LGBTQ rights in an unusual public move. Jeff T Green has also donated $600,000 to the LGBTQ-rights group Equality Utah. A Madagascan minister was one of two survivors to have swum about 12 hours to shore after their helicopter crashed off the island’s north-east coast, authorities said. A search was continuing for two other passengers after Monday’s crash, the cause of which was not immediately clear. A Harvard University professor charged with hiding his ties to a Chinese-run recruitment program has been found guilty on all counts. Charles Lieber, 62, the former chair of Harvard’s department of chemistry and chemical biology, had pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. In the moments before a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck the northern California coast on Monday, roughly half a million phones buzzed. An early-alert system managed by the US Geological Survey sent warnings out before the ground started to shake, giving residents in the sparsely populated area vital time to take cover. The earthquake brought significant shaking but minimal damage in Humboldt county, and officials said it was an excellent test of the alert system. What Stuart Heritage has learned from baldness is this: choose your role models carefully. For a while his was Stanley Tucci, but in reality, he says, Tucci does the bald a disservice. He is too charming, too handsome, too well-dressed. “We might think that we can harness our inner Tucci, but it’s impossible. He is a movie star, with a movie star’s presence. Instead, I found myself glomming on to Larry David, who has this year become my uncontested bald oracle. Nobody on Earth seems to understand the bald experience like David,” he writes. Costa Rica is the only tropical country that has successfully halted and reversed deforestation, a commitment that dozens of other countries have made but are far from achieving. It is aiming for total decarbonisation by 2050, not just a net zero target. If there had been a popularity contest at Cop26, the Costa Rican president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, would have been a clear winner. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeff Bezos, Boris Johnson and Prince William all wanted to speak with the leader of the tiny Central American country, eager to bask in its green glow. A new kind of chip shortage has hit Japanese supply chains, with McDonald’s forced to ration fries as Covid-19 and floods in Canada squeeze potato imports. McDonald’s Japan said it would only sell small-sized french fries for a week from Friday to avoid shortages. “Due to large-scale flooding near the Port of Vancouver … and the global supply chain crunch caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there are delays in the supply of potatoes,” it said.",News/US news,Biden seeks to rally the troops in Covid battle | First Thing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/22/first-thing-biden-seeks-to-rally-the-troops-in-covid-battle
