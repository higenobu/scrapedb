5/7/2022,"Piers Corbyn has been fined £250 after accusing NHS staff at a London Covid-19 vaccination clinic of murdering people. The brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had arrived with a group of anti-vaxxers at Guy’s hospital in central London on 18 January with a “cease and desist” letter that they claimed was to prevent NHS staff from administering the Covid-19 vaccine. Corbyn told Chelsea Butcher, a nursing sister: “We are not leaving, you are murdering people here,” and another member of the group said, “This is a crime scene,” Westminster magistrates court heard. Iestyn Morgan, prosecuting, said Corbyn, 75, and David Burridge, 44, from Hounslow, west London, refused to leave the hospital’s atrium despite requests from NHS staff and police. At the trial, Corbyn, from Walworth, south-east London, said he had been arrested 15 times since the start of the pandemic, and he was “not there trying to obstruct people doing anything”. The district judge Briony Clarke found the pair guilty of causing a nuisance or disturbance on NHS premises without reasonable excuse. “In my view, the defendants were there in order to try to stop the centre operating, hence the ‘cease and desist’ letter they were producing to the members of NHS staff,” Clarke said. Corbyn was fined £250 and Burridge £200, and they were each ordered to pay a further £234 in costs and other charges.",News/UK news,Piers Corbyn fined over ‘murder’ claim at Covid vaccine clinic,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/06/piers-corbyn-fined-over-claim-at-covid-vaccine-clinic
5/7/2022,"The Conservatives suffered disastrous losses across Wales, with the party’s Welsh leadership blaming the crisis in No 10 for their woes, while there were encouraging gains for Labour, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. One of the most striking results on Friday came in Denbighshire in the north-east where the Tories dropped from first to fourth place. They lost control of their only council, Monmouthshire, in the south-east. Denbighshire is seen as crucial because the Tories routed Labour there during the 2019 general election. Boris Johnson visited the seaside town of Rhyl to try to shore up support but some party members on the ground believe his presence hindered rather than helped. The Tories had been part of an independent-led administration but Labour became the biggest party in the county and may now try to form a new coalition. In Monmouthshire, Labour becomes the largest group for the first time since 1995. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Tories at the Welsh parliament, said the party’s candidates had wanted to talk about how they were tackling the cost-of-living crisis locally, but had to answer questions about Johnson. Labour was celebrating victory in the south Wales valleys seat of Blaenau Gwent, where the party gained control from the independents. It also won overall control in another of its key target seats, Bridgend. The party retained councils such Cardiff, Newport, Torfaen, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly, though the Labour leader in the latter area, Philippa Marsden, lost her seat, her defeat blamed on an unpopular plan for a new waste plant. Speaking before all the results had come in, a Labour source said: “It’s been a good set of results. The Tories’ vote has crumbled … There’s no trust in the prime minister. They are fed up with the Tories concentrating on shoring up the prime minister’s position rather than the cost of living crisis.” The Labour economy minister, Vaughan Gething, said the party would not take any voter for granted ahead of the next general election but told BBC Radio Wales: “It does show we’re not in the position we were in 2019 – that’s real progress for us in Wales and really important if we’re going to have a UK Labour government following the next general election.” Plaid Cymru took majority control of Ynys Môn, the Isle of Anglesey. The party led the council between 2017-22 but were dependent on independent members to push its programme through. The Lib Dems became the largest party in Powys, mid Wales. The Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, Jane Dodds, said results were the start of a “comeback”. The Greens also won seats across the country where they have not been represented before, from Newport in the south to Conwy in the north. All 22 councils in Wales held elections and for the first time 16- and 17-year-olds were able to vote in the elections.",News/Politics,Welsh Tories blame No 10 as they reel from disastrous losses across country,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/welsh-tories-blame-no-10-as-they-reel-from-disastrous-losses-across-country
5/7/2022,"If Keir Starmer is fined for a breach of lockdown rules, the person who would claim credit for bringing him down is the anti-lockdown campaigner Laurence Fox. Fox, the former actor and leader of the niche Reform party, was the first person to widely share a 34-second grainy video showing the maskless Labour leader having a beer with one of his MPs after a day’s campaigning. In the background party activists can be seen eating curry, in what Labour has always insisted was a work environment. The self-proclaimed vaccine sceptic – and ex-husband of Billie Piper – mockingly captioned his upload: “It would seem that the mask has already slipped for Keir Starmer. Don’t share widely. No one is perfect.” The original footage was filmed on 30 April 2021 by a third-year student at the University of Durham. They anonymously told the student newspaper Palatinate they happened to pass the building when they saw “something that I thought was an injustice and decided to film it because it made me angry”. The student said they felt Starmer was practising “double standards” but they were uncomfortable with recent coverage and “didn’t want to help Boris in any way”. At that time, pubs and restaurants were legally allowed to serve groups of six people outdoors but most of the population was still under substantial restrictions on socialising and large indoor gatherings were banned. The student shared the video with friends, which was quickly forwarded to a wider audience, including anti-lockdown activists. Fox uploaded a copy at 8.42am the following morning to glee from his particular corner of anti-Labour, anti-lockdown Twitter. Yet few mainstream outlets considered it a news story at the time, potentially because of Fox’s pariah status and the unclear provenance of the footage. The Sun on Sunday picked up on the clip and published a brief article on page two of its newspaper – the traditional slot for political stories that are not expected to get widely read. Even fellow rightwing newspapers ignored it and the clip languished in relative obscurity for the rest of the year. What changed was the rolling Partygate scandal that pre-occupied Westminster through December and January. Boris Johnson came under fire from his own MPs after it was alleged officials at No 10 had been drinking and socialising throughout the darkest periods of the pandemic era in 2020, as the rest of the country endured severe restrictions. Starmer took a strong stance on Johnson’s rule-breaking, calling for the prime minister to resign when he was put under police investigation. At this point, some of the first outlets to revive interest in the old video were leftwing, anti-Starmer online news outlets, such as Skwawkbox, that had sprung up to support Jeremy Corbyn. As the pressure mounted on Johnson, the Daily Mail put the Durham pictures on the front page of its 15 January print edition under the headline “Starmer the Covid party hypocrite”. But it was only after both the prime minister and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, were last month fined for breaching lockdown rules in Downing Street that rightwing newspapers put their full weight behind the story. Nine months after the video was first reported, the Daily Mail and the Sun began publishing a series of articles, tracking down the driver who delivered the curry to the Labour party office and pushing for Durham constabulary to open an investigation. The police’s recent announcement means the media pressure is now likely to increase further, with the BBC and other broadcast outlets swinging behind a story they could previously dismiss as an ideologically driven attack but that they now see as a more straightforward tale about an ongoing police investigation.",News/Politics,How media took nine months to leap on Starmer beer footage,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/media-keir-starmer-lockdown-beer-footage
5/7/2022,"They’re used to dealing with floods at New Road but on Friday the famous old ground was hit by a hurricane. It went by the name of Ben Stokes, England’s newly coronated Test captain unleashing a record-breaking 88-ball 161 on his return for Durham and coming agonisingly close to striking six sixes in a single over. Only two men in the history of first-class cricket have achieved the feat – Sir Garfield Sobers in 1968 and Ravi Shastri in 1985 – and once Stokes sent the first five deliveries of Josh Baker’s 20th over into the crowd, bringing up a 64-ball century, a hush descended. Could a third member be about to join this elite club? It was not to be, Stokes duffing his contact with the final ball from Worcestershire’s 18-year-old left-arm spinner and seeing a mere four result. Some 34 runs had been raided from the over but you would scarcely have known it, Stokes recoiling in frustration at an opportunity missed. What a ridiculous sport. Nevertheless, it was a memorable moment in an innings that still secured two slices of history. Stokes had eclipsed Paul Collingwood’s 75-ball hundred against Somerset in 2005 – previously the fastest by a Durham player – and after lunch, when Brett D’Oliveira was carved into the stand that bears the leg-spinner’s family name, he had secured the record of 17 sixes in a County Championship innings. And having espoused a team-first philosophy in his first press conference as England captain in the week, one can only assume that Stokes drew more satisfaction from the position of outright dominance that he and David Bedingham, 135 from 175 balls, had secured in this Division Two encounter. Declaring on 580 for six once Stokes and Bedingham had holed out, Durham set about their mission to claim 20 wickets with purpose. By 5.53pm local time, when bad light stopped play with 12 overs of a chilly second day remaining, Worcestershire were 169 for six with Matthew Potts claiming figures of five for 36. On another day Potts might well have been the headliner. The 23-year-old right-armer from Sunderland has added a yard of pace over the winter and, having been one of England’s standby players for the recent Caribbean tour, the form he has already shown this season – 23 wickets at 19 – may see this status upgraded. But as waspish as Potts looked, no one was knocking Stokes off the top of the bill. Like a younger Lord Botham, among those watching on from the hospitality tent, he was impossible to ignore. Even with the ball, while ticking an important box after recent knee problems, he drew gasps, nearly striking in his first over when Ed Barnard squirted one back onto his stumps only for the bails to remain in place. This was the only time that the force was not with Stokes, having earlier sauntered out to the middle in the third over of the day with 360 for four on the board and Bedingham unbeaten on 81. Whether England can lay such a platform this summer remains to be seen but, having stated his desire to return to No 6 in the Test team, this was a smidgeon of early vindication for the self-imposed demotion. Stokes had made a watchful start too, cracking a couple of early fours but sitting 12 not out by the time he had faced 30 deliveries. Thereafter it was utter carnage, the 30-year-old signalling the charge when he launched Barnard towards the neighbouring hotel for the first of a number of blows which threatened its windows. Amid the charge to 147 not out by lunch came a remarkable 10-ball sequence in which Stokes ransacked 53 runs and gave Baker a story to tell the grandchildren one day. By this stage, Stokes had struck 15 sixes and wasted no time drawing level with the previous record holders – Andrew Symonds and Graham Napier – when he drove Ben Gibbon’s first ball after the interval into a sightscreen. Picking out a shot of the day was almost impossible, such was the smorgasbord of unbridled aggression on show. A personal favourite was a charging swivelled pull off Joe Leach that flew flat and square but the 1,000 or so spectators present at New Road will doubtless have their own to tell others about. This was a flat pitch, a tired attack and an international player operating on another level to the mere mortals around him. But England, having turned to Stokes in their hour of need and asked him to captain what is a flatlining Test team, will hope this particular hurricane is just the start of storm season. As the man himself put it at the close: “It was a good day, wasn’t it?”",Sport/Sport,Ben Stokes breaks sixes record with devastating innings for Durham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/06/ben-stokes-breaks-sixes-record-with-devastating-innings-for-durham
5/7/2022,"Boris Johnson’s leadership is facing fresh peril after senior Conservatives blamed him for losing swaths of the party’s southern heartlands to the Liberal Democrats and flagship London boroughs to Labour. In a punishing set of local elections for the Tories, the party lost about 350 council seats in England, ceding control of Westminster and Wandsworth in London to Labour for the first time since the 1970s, and plunged to its worst position in Scotland for a decade. Conservative MPs and council leaders questioned Johnson’s leadership, demanding action to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild trust in the wake of the Partygate scandal after a damaging series of losses across the “blue wall” in Somerset, Kent, Oxfordshire and Surrey. However, the scale of the Tory backlash was tempered by a mixed picture for Labour, which showed progress, but not enough yet to suggest a landslide for Keir Starmer in a general election. A BBC projection for a general election based on Friday’s results put Labour on 291 seats, the Conservatives on 253, the Lib Dems on 31 and others on 75. Labour had a very strong result in London and took some southern councils such as Worthing, Crawley and Southampton, gaining about 50 seats across England. It also looked set to do well in Wales, and took over from the Tories as the party with the second largest vote share in Scotland, where the SNP remained dominant. But in the north of England and the Midlands, Labour struggled to make gains in “red wall” areas it had lost at or since the 2019 election, despite a convincing win on the new Cumberland council. Conservative HQ was also buoyed by the news that Starmer is now being investigated over allegations of Covid rule-breaking at a Durham campaign event, muddying the waters over Johnson’s own fine for a lockdown gathering. Starmer said the results were a “big turning point” for his party. “From the depths of 2019, that general election, winning in the north, Cumberland, Southampton. We’ve changed Labour and now we’re seeing the results of that.” However, it was the Lib Dems who had the most clearly successful election night in England, adding more than 150 seats. They took control of the new unitary authority in Somerset, previously a Tory stronghold, edged out the Conservatives in Portsmouth, and pushed them out of control in West Oxfordshire. The Greens also performed well, winning 54 seats – more than doubling their number of councillors – as voters also turned to independents and residents’ associations. The Lib Dem leader, Ed Davey, called the results “an almighty shockwave that will bring this Conservative government tumbling down”. He described the result in Somerset, where his party took 56 seats compared with 29 for the Tories, as a “political earthquake”, and said rural communities were fed up with being taken for granted. There were also dramatic results in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin looked set to get the largest share of the vote for the first time, as the Democratic Unionist party suffered in the aftermath of the Brexit agreement. As the results got progressively worse for the Tories throughout Friday, Johnson’s MPs considered whether the outcome was dire enough to justify another an attempt to oust him. Conservative critics of the prime minister said they would be ringing round over the weekend to see whether the scale of discontent was enough to defeat Johnson in a confidence vote. They would need 54 letters from Tory MPs to trigger a contest and 179 votes against the prime minister to oust him. Even if they decide to wait to see the conclusion of Partygate investigations before acting, a one-nation Tory MP said there would be a push to get Johnson to consider bringing in more figures from the centrist wing of the party, such as Jeremy Hunt and Greg Clark, in response to the resurgent threat from the Lib Dems. One minister in a blue wall seat said: “The prime minister can certainly see off any threats from the usual suspects, who have never supported him and simply seek to find opportunities to challenge him, damaging the whole party in the process. But the party chairman [and] CCHQ [Conservative campaign headquarters] really do need to get their heads around the battleground for the election being here in the south, not in the north, and it not all being about Labour, who are still not making sufficient inroads to form a majority government.” Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, said that while voters did not blame ministers for the cost of living crisis, the government would be judged on its response. “The danger for the government is it will be perceived to not have done enough to feel the pain and ease people’s pain,” he said. Buckland said opposition attempts to paint the Tories as heartless were gaining some traction but would prove more damaging if their competence was also brought into doubt. “That is why I think the government cannot just look at these results and say, ‘Everything’s fine, we can carry on business as usual’. They are going to have to signal they understand and are going to offer more help.” The Wimbledon MP Stephen Hammond, who saw the Lib Dems take council seats at the Conservatives’ expense in his local borough of Merton, said: “That ought to be a clarion bell ringing in Downing Street to make sure we are concentrating on the cost of living.” Asked about Johnson’s future, he told the BBC: “I think he has to prove his integrity to the country.” Many grassroots Tories laid the blame at Johnson’s door for the loss of their seats. John Mallinson, the Conservative leader of Carlisle city council, told the BBC he had “lost some very good colleagues” in the Cumberland local election, and had found it “difficult to drag the debate back to local issues” while campaigning, because of Partygate and the cost of living crisis. He said: “I think it is not just Partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don’t feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.” Asked if Conservative MPs should remove Johnson, he said: “That would be my preference, yes.” Labour dismissed the suggestion it was not making progress, pointing out that its vote share was up in key battleground seats when measured against its catastrophic performance at the 2019 general election. It said that on this basis it looked on course to win back up to 26 seats that voted leave in the EU referendum, including Carlisle, Great Grimsby and Workington.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson under renewed pressure after damaging local election losses,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/boris-johnson-under-renewed-pressure-after-damaging-local-election-losses
5/7/2022,"There is a temptation to wince just a little each time a news item or a social media line drops containing the words Emma Raducanu. Not because of anything to do with Raducanu herself, who will shortly hit the one-year anniversary of her entry into the full women’s tour, during which she has been not just startlingly successful but gracious in defeat and polished in public, rattling through the chaos, the bruises, the wrong turns of a debut teenage year in professional sport. She looks happy. This is all good, isn’t it? And yet, of course, that’s not the whole story. Raducanu was in the news for two reasons this week. First her exit from the Madrid Open, beaten by Anhelina Kalinina in the third round. And second for her appearance in something called the Forbes 30 Under 30 List, the kind of self-generating media gush that allows people to produce titillating web galleries of glossy, aspirational people, but also gives an idea of brand value, marketing heft, career trajectory. Raducanu is in there, along with Mo Salah – who is 30 next month and already worth $90m – plus an endless scroll of people who look like kind of high-end London estate agents who say things like “amassing over four thousand square feet” but who turn out on closer inspection to be start-up whizzes, influencer types, hit-the-jackpot investors and the like. Forbes is a weird publication, a kind of airport lounge lifestyle jazz mag. But it makes a good list. And as ever, with Raducanu as the headline name, this one drew the usual spume of online snark, rage and counter-rage. This is just the way it seems to work. Raducanu triggers people, and triggers them in curious ways. Throughout the last year she has been trailed by a weirdly personal strain of negativity, by haters where really there is no need for haters. Her losses have been crowed and high-fived over, injuries met with disbelieving sneers. Does this matter? Raducanu is doing very well. She doesn’t need anyone to speak for her. Even writing about this stuff is more fuel to the furnace. But there is a harder point here. We are at the start of period when this process is likely to hit fever pitch. The next few weeks will take her on to Roland Garros and then into the high summer bloom of the grass season, with a Wimbledon fortnight unobscured by the Fifa World Cup, and all set to go doolally in that familiar and admittedly very annoying way over its new star. She will now be thoroughly over-exposed. The matches in SW19 will become lager-hurling outdoor events, the victories a source of bell-ringing BBC joy, defeats a line on the News at Ten (the sobbing face-painted child, the baleful wave to a flushed centre court). Reporters will sniff hungrily for back story bits and boyfriend gold. Chin-stroking opinion articles will be penned (again) on the meaning of Raducanu, her signifiers, her resonance in the cultural farrago of a post-Brexit, post-imperial, post-basically-everything Britain. Boots will sell out of scrunchies. A TV pundit will make an inappropriate remark. Commercial sponsors will goggle and drool. And all the while in the background the wave of online rage will reach an answering peak. Just click on any online Raducanu story. There is a certain voice to this, the voice of angry anonymity. To Dave from Egham Raducanu represents fluff, spin, hype. The US Open win was a lucky run, something that is now being shamelessly monetised, thereby stealing attention, space and legitimacy from real sport, real heroes, real men. Dave from Egham sees a woke hero. Dave from Egham sees only decline, dissipated power, others succeeding unjustly. Where does this come from? The reaction to John McEnroe’s comment about Raducanu needing to toughen up after last year’s Wimbledon exit was a little overblown. But this was then seized on with vampiric glee by Piers Morgan, whose success as a polemicist is based in stapling himself to each passing issue, personage or hot topic and becoming a fanfare for the most perverse and provocative version, thereby stealing a tint little hit of its noise and heat; in a way that is probably quite addictive if you can bear doing that to yourself. In this way a thought some people might have in the dark, the idea that a successful young women must be reined in, exposed, denied the right to be sponsored by Porsche, to rake it in, is made flesh and legitimised. This creates referred pain. There is already a problem with encouraging girls and women to play sport, with treating them with respect when they do. These are issues of health and happiness and wellbeing, the whole point of doing this stuff, the best part of it, and that well of bile is corrosive. Beyond this it is just such a waste, because Raducanu is a genuinely interesting athlete. Her success is an outsider success; home made, self-taught, and a model for anyone who watches or plays or coaches sport. Right now she is the only teenager in the top 15 in the world. She doesn’t have obvious physical advantages. She doesn’t hit exceptionally hard. She will have days where she is simply pulverised by some vast shrieking gym monster with a pterodactyl’s wingspan. She is essentially trying to learn tennis while playing tennis. A few weeks back she lost to Danka Kovinic at the Australian Open while playing with a blister that made it hard to hold her racket. Faced with this Raducanu started improvising, playing sliced backhands, hanging in there, finding new angles. Raducanu is working this out herself. This is her super strength, a very bright mind, an awareness of her capacities, and a basic fearlessness. And two things stand out at this stage. Raducanu may never win another slam, but her achievements are already exceptional; at the same time in the year since New York she has at no stage responded to the pressure being placed on her, showing instead remarkable poise. The self-possession will be tested a little more from here. The summer of Emma is nearly upon us.

5/7/2022,"Five health workers have been charged with a range of criminal offences as part of a major police investigation into the alleged ill treatment of stroke patients in hospital. The charges were announced more than three years after police were contacted by Blackpool teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust in November 2018 about concerns raised over the care provided to a number of patients. Three nurses and two healthcare assistants who worked at Blackpool Victoria hospital have been charged with offences including ill treatment relating to the unlawful sedation of patients, as well as the theft and supply of medication. Lancashire police said the investigation centred on “the care provided to often elderly and vulnerable people” over “a number of years”. The alleged offences were committed on the hospital’s stroke unit. Catherine Hudson, 52, of Coriander Close, Blackpool, was charged with seven counts of a care worker ill-treating or wilfully neglecting an individual, eight offences of conspiring to steal from an employer, one count of theft by employee, and one count of perverting the course of justice. Charlotte Wilmot, 47, of Bowland Crescent, Blackpool, was charged with encouraging/assisting in the commission of an offence believing it will be committed, relating to encouraging a nurse to sedate a patient, one count of conspiring to ill-treat a patient, and four offences of conspiring to steal from an employer. Matthew Pover, 39, of Bearwood Road, Smethwick, West Midlands, was charged with conspiring to steal from employer, theft by employee, supplying a class C drug and offering to supply a class C drug. Victoria Holehouse, 31, of Riverside Drive, Hambleton, was charged with two counts of conspiring to steal from employer, and Marek Grabianowski, 45, of Montpelier Avenue, Bispham, was charged with three counts of conspiring to steal from an employer and one count of perverting the course of justice. The charges relate to the period between August 2014 and November 2018. All five defendants are due to appear at Blackpool magistrates court on May 31. Detective Ch Insp Jill Johnston, leading the investigation, said: “This is a complex investigation into allegations of unlawful sedation and ill treatment of patients on the stroke unit at Blackpool over a number of years. “The safety of patients and the public remains our absolute priority and this inquiry has investigated the care provided to often elderly and vulnerable people. Everyone should be safe in hospital, to receive the care they require and be treated with dignity and respect. “Our investigation remains ongoing and we continue to provide support to the many families affected. I would encourage anyone with information to contact the investigation team in confidence and someone from the team will recontact you.” Police said the investigation was not linked to the charging of a 51-year-old man in December 2021 with a number of sexual assaults at the hospital.

5/7/2022,"The council elections in England reveal that not all politics is local. On the doorstep, voters brought up the cost of living crisis and Boris Johnson being fined for breaking life-saving Covid rules. Mr Johnson knows the Conservatives did badly. But he hopes the party did not do badly enough for his Commons opponents to move against him. The Labour party did well. But perhaps not well enough to convincingly herald an English resurgence. Instead, voters gave their support to smaller parties that offered any sort of alternative. Sir Keir Starmer hailed totemic victories in London – notably the Tory strongholds of Wandsworth and Westminster – as a “turning point” for Labour. In left-behind places such as Carlisle, set in pastoral Cumberland, and Rossendale, Sir Keir won surprising victories. However, large parts of England outside the capital failed to turn for Labour. At the time of writing, the one-point advance in Labour’s vote share in London was accompanied by a three-point fall in the north of England. In 2019, Mr Johnson won parliamentary seats across northern England, attracting Labour’s working-class voters. His political strategy had been to consolidate those gains. In central England, this gameplan appears to be still working. The Tories took all the seats in Bedworth – in 2015 the party had none – to tighten the party’s grip on the Midlands’ Nuneaton and Bedworth council. However, since Britain left the EU, the issue of Brexit has waned. Labour won control of Crawley, Worthing and Southampton, places in the south that voted to leave. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens are attracting younger, more educated voters as well as former Tory supporters disillusioned with Mr Johnson’s chaotic rule. This strategy works particularly well for the Lib Dems and the Greens. Both parties appeal to graduates who recoil from the government’s incompetence. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, emphasises his party’s socially liberal attitudes, whereas the Green party has a radical economic message. The latter is quietly nibbling away at Labour’s vote, enough to deprive Sir Keir’s party of a majority in Hastings. There are just nine parliamentary seats where the Lib Dems are the key challengers to Labour. And these elections confirm that the Lib Dems have become formidable opponents to the Tories. There was an average increase of eight points in the Liberal Democrat vote across places where the party started off in second place to the Conservatives – enough to dethrone the Tories in Somerset. The Lib Dem success in south-west London will unsettle Conservatives, as will the loss of West Oxfordshire council from Tory hands for the first time in 20 years. Durham police’s announcement that it will be investigating whether Sir Keir broke lockdown rules will dampen his party’s spirits, though many lawyers suggest that he is in the clear. Labour needs to rebuild its core vote. There are signs that it is doing so in Scotland, where the party won control of West Dunbartonshire. Scottish Labour is on course to replace the Tories as the main challenger to the SNP. Here, too, Green advances come at the expense of the more centrist SNP. In Wales, the Tories were also losing ground, with Labour capturing Monmouthshire for the first time. Labour has a 35% share of the national vote, the Tories 30%, and the Lib Dems 19%. Sir Keir would fall short of a Commons majority if Labour did as well at the next general election. But these polls are not the same as parliamentary ones. Turnout is low. The swing voters who switched from Labour to the Tories in 2019 are probably missing. The prime minister is out of touch. He is failing to placate disgruntled supporters. As he prepares to outline the government’s main policies for the year ahead, Mr Johnson must be wondering how he can.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on the May elections: Labour did well, but not well enough | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-may-elections-labour-did-well-but-not-well-enough

The invitation to Scholz and the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, follows weeks of intense Ukrainian criticism of Germany over its reluctance to supply weapons or support an EU-wide embargo on Russian energy imports. Germany is especially dependent on Russia for gas and says it would suffer more from an embargo than Russia.

They want to be in the grey area, stay in the shadow, or to be walking in between the drops of rain. But there are no drops any more. It is pouring and everyone is soaking wet.” Speaking to the the British thinktank Chatham House, Zelenskiy offered to hold talks with Russia if it returned to the territory it held inside Ukraine before the 24 February invasion. He said the offer would be withdrawn if Ukrainian military or civilians were attacked during the evacuation of Mariupol. “If Russia kills civilians or soldiers who could be released, we cannot conduct diplomatic negotiations with them,” Zelenskiy said. He repeated Ukrainian claims that the Russians were preparing a victory parade in the long besieged city on 9 May, but added: “Mariupol will never fall, and I’m not talking about heroism, but there is nothing left to fall apart, it is already devastated and has no structure.” Ukrainian officials accused Russia of violating a ceasefire on Friday aimed at evacuating scores of civilians trapped in a bombed-out steelworks in Mariupol. The city has endured the most destructive siege of the 10-week-old war, and the sprawling Soviet-era Azovstal plant is the last part of it still in the hands of Ukrainian fighters. Ukraine’s military said Russia was continuing a blockade of its fighters in the plant. There are thought to be about 200 Ukrainian soldiers still fighting, many of them determined to die rather than surrender. UN-brokered evacuations of some of the hundreds of civilians who had taken shelter in the plant’s network of tunnels and bunkers began last weekend but were halted in recent days by renewed fighting. The head of Ukraine’s presidential staff, Andriy Yermak, said the next stage of the rescue had started on Friday, but Mariupol authorities said Russian forces had fired at a car that was involved, killing one Ukrainian fighter and wounding six. Captain Sviatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, pleaded on Ukrainian TV for the evacuation of civilians and wounded fighters from the steelworks, saying soldiers were “dying in agony due to the lack of proper treatment”. Scholz is due to make a nationwide television address on 8 May, and to speak to fellow G7 leaders by video. He previously angered Ukraine when he said he would not visit while Steinmeier – a longtime advocate of closer relations with Russia – was banned from visiting Kyiv. Zelenskiy spoke to Steinmeier on Thursday to offer him a visit. EU officials are in the process of delaying the date by which all EU states will be required to impose an oil embargo from Russia, owing to objections from Hungary and Slovakia. Zelenskiy said Ukraine could block the Russian advance when it had the necessary equipment and refused to be drawn on the wider military implications if Mariupol finally fell. Ukrainian forces have in effect lost access to the port, and its fall would allow Russia to establish a land corridor to the Crimean peninsula, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops to fight elsewhere in the Donbas, the eastern industrial region that the Kremlin says is now its chief objective. Zelenskiy urged the west to do more to bring those responsible for war crimes to justice more quickly. “Russian leaders believe responsibility can be postponed for decades if it ever comes,” he said. Russia he said believed it had impunity because “they have the power of the nuclear state and the nuclear blackmail”. A senior official from the Russian parliament said on Friday that Russia would remain in southern Ukraine “for ever”. Speaking on a visit to the Moscow-controlled city of Kherson, Andrey Turchak said: “There should be no doubt about this. There will be no return to the past. We will live together, develop this rich region, rich in historical heritage, rich in the people who live here.” Turchak announced the opening of a humanitarian aid centre in Kherson for the delivery of food, medicine and other essentials. It was the first time a senior Russian official had indicated Moscow’s intention to remain present on Ukrainian territory. Western officials are confident that Vladimir Putin will not use his 9 May address – to which no foreign leader has been invited – to announce a general mobilisation since it would be likely to provoke a political backlash.",News/World news,Zelenskiy invites Germany’s Scholz to visit Ukraine on Russia’s Victory Day,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/zelenskiy-invites-germany-scholz-to-visit-ukraine-on-russia-victory-day
5/7/2022,"President Joe Biden’s strong response to the leaked draft supreme court position is welcome (US shaken to its core by supreme court draft that would overturn Roe v Wade, 3 May). The attack on women’s reproductive rights was entirely predictable with the Trumpian legacy of a biased supreme court. Access to local, safe and affordable contraception and abortion services is a key indicator of both women’s reproductive rights and women’s health. Simply put, girls and women die when access to contraception and safe abortion is denied. The global impact of overturning Roe v Wade would be enormous. Poland banned abortion in 2021 and Slovenia reduced access. There would be increased pressure in other countries to do the same. The main immediate concern, though, would be the impact on countries and continents with the highest maternal death rates. In 2017, by World Health Organization regions, the highest maternal death rate was in sub-Saharan Africa (533 per 100,000 births) and the lowest in western Europe (five per 100,000). Maternal death rates today in parts of Africa are the same as in the UK 150 years ago. There are, of course, massive underlying impacts from poverty and malnutrition but once women and girls have access to contraception and safe abortion, numbers of pregnancies fall, maternal death rates fall and overall community health improves, even in the poorest areas. Globally and locally, we must support women’s reproductive rights.Dr Tricia CresswellAlnwick, Northumberland  I never thought the war on women would come to my doorstep until 2003, a year after marrying my husband. I was 33, pregnant and deliriously happy. At our scheduled ultrasound, we learned that our baby had spina bifida and anencephaly – the baby (we later learned was a girl) had neither a skull nor a spine. The chances of her survival were zero, and my doctor scheduled a surgical abortion as soon as he heard the news. The following days were a blur of grief and sadness. I did not know how lucky I was to live in a big city in Canada where abortion is readily available until I joined an online support group for women who, like me, had decided to terminate a wanted pregnancy. The majority of women in this group are from the US and many of them tell of harrowing experiences, of being sworn at, physically attacked or threatened, just to have access to information about what to do after getting news similar to what I had received. The slow realisation that the face of abortion was also me was so shocking that it bolted me into action and changed everything about how I think. Make no mistake, the world is engaged in a war on women; the leaked draft supreme court ruling is just a confirmation of that fact. Let no one stand idly by; we must all raise our voices, rise and vote until the right to control our bodies is a universal, irrefutable truth. I hope the American women enraged by the leaked ruling know that their sisters around the world feel their rage and stand with them with raised fists in full solidarity.Karin BjornsonMontreal, Canada  While Marina Hyde rightly points out that illegal abortions that kill women cannot possibly be a “pro-life” stance (3 May), it’s the much wider problem of unwanted babies that is the issue. Foetuses don’t demand to be born, but born children want to be wanted, hopefully by two parents. If the progenitors cannot feel strong love, society should not force someone to give birth, which just punishes the born child with the blow of unwantedness. So-called pro-lifers don’t actually care about children.Monica ThrelfallLondon  No matter how draconian the denial of abortion access may be, the rich and well connected will always be able to bypass it. It is exclusively the less well off who will be denied their civil rights, as we see with those unable to afford the fare from Northern Ireland.Mary PimmLondon  It is a tragically confused and misguided world where a country’s legislative processes threaten the right of a desperate woman to terminate an unwanted pregnancy, and at the same time ask a condemned man to choose which of two equally horrific methods he would prefer them to kill him with (Death row inmate’s dreadful dilemma: lethal drugs or cyanide used by Nazis, 4 May).Roger MundayHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
