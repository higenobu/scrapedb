4/13/2022,"Both Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak are to be fined for breaking Covid rules, as is the prime ministers’s wife, Carrie Johnson. Here’s how we got here – and where it might go next. The ongoing police investigation into allegations of lockdown-breaching parties in and around Downing Street has already seen 20 fixed penalty notices issued at the start of this month. On Tuesday, the Metropolitan police said it had issued 30 more over the gatherings, with No 10 then saying Johnson and Sunak were among these. Carrie Johnson’s spokesperson also said she had also been informed about a fine. It started in November last year when the Daily Mirror said Johnson made a speech at a leaving event a year earlier, when England was in the middle of a Covid lockdown, and that a Christmas party took place that December in Downing Street. No 10 insisted that rules were followed at all times, but more and more allegations followed. A week after the first allegations, a video was leaked to ITV showing Downing Street staff joking about an apparent party in December 2020. More than 15 alleged events have been reported, spanning a period from mid-May 2020 to April 2021. Among them were a cheese and wine gathering in the No 10 garden on 15 May 2020, of which the Guardian was sent a photograph; a “bring your own booze” party, also in the garden; an alleged party in Johnson’s flat five days later in November 2020 on the day Dominic Cummings left his job; and two “boozy” leaving parties taking place in No 10 simultaneously in April 2021, the night before Prince Philip’s funeral. While the Met has said that in general it will not reveal what parties fines have been issued for, it confirmed that Johnson’s fine was in relation to a surprise birthday party organised for him in No 10 on 19 June 2020. Sunak also attended this event, although he supposedly did so partly by accident, arriving early for a meeting. Carrie Johnson’s fine is also believed to be in connection with the same party, although this has not been confirmed. While Sunak is not believed to have attended any other parties being investigated, it remains possible that both Johnson and Carrie Johnson could be fined over other events. According to Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and just about every other opposition party – yes. The argument is that both of them categorically denied in the Commons that they breached any rules, and thus misled parliament – a breach of the ministerial code seen as a resignation issue. However, there appears little immediate appetite among Tory MPs to replace Johnson, in part because of the Ukraine war, and because the minister seen as his most likely replacement, Sunak, is now badly damaged by both the fine and revelations last week about his family’s tax affairs. That said, things could move fast, and this is unprecedented political territory. Downing Street has promised that Johnson will make a statement only when the entire police operation is over. However, this could take many more weeks, and there is pressure for him to say something immediately, with Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP calling for the Commons, which is currently on Easter recess, to be recalled. The report by Gray, a senior civil servant, was ordered after a series of media claims about parties and had been completed when the police belatedly decided to investigate potential criminal breaches, meaning only a very brief précis was published. Officials say the full report will be released once the police inquiry is over, potentially with a delay of a week or so for the report to be revised in the light of the police findings. It is not believed that a prime minister and/or chancellor has committed criminal offences while in office.",News/Politics,Lockdown party fines: what next for Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/lockdown-party-fines-what-next-for-boris-johnson-and-rishi-sunak
4/13/2022,"Women have fought against prejudice and discrimination on grounds of their sex status for generations. In this country, the equality legislation that exists now is largely a result of that struggle, or has been stimulated by its example. But women’s struggle is not over. They still suffer unfairly on account of their sex status, and the demands that are now being made to soften their struggle by relaxing rights to single-sex spaces are but one example of this injustice. Women are still at risk from male strangers, and they constitute the population group most often murdered or coerced by male partners. It is men, in these situations, who are the problem and who, as a population group, should bear the burden of searching for, and living with, the solutions. And now, to make matters worse, we find commentators like Zoe Williams (Labour needs to own its policy on gender – and unequivocally back trans rights, 6 April) referring to calls from women for the preservation of their rights to single-sex spaces and dismissing their concerns as “hokey, made-up scenario[s]”. Her flippant complacency demonstrates a lack of understanding of the reality of many women’s lives. She should think again.Gillian DalleyLondon  Zoe Williams sums up the real situation regarding trans people so succinctly. Trans rights do not conflict with women’s rights – they are simply human rights. She is correct that it is cruel to discriminate against trans people just because a violent person might pretend to be trans – and it won’t make anyone any safer.Dr Jane HamlinCurry Rivel, Somerset  Thank you to Susanna Rustin for her article (Labour’s contradictory policies on trans and women’s rights must be addressed, 6 April). The argument that women’s oppression is based on their sex, and that rights won should recognise that, is logical. I had no idea that Woman’s Place UK had been called transphobic, and am quite shocked that prominent female Labour politicians have supported this view. The legal case for everyone to be treated fairly is not in question, surely? That the presence of penises should dominate the conversation, is predictable and depressing, however, and reveals the limited understanding on display. The new US supreme court judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, on being asked whether she could define a woman, just said: “No, I can’t.” How wise.Jacqueline DarbyLondon  The Royal College of General Practitioners is one of 20 health organisations that signed a memorandum of understanding opposing conversion therapy, so we were disappointed by the government’s proposal to ban the practice for lesbian, gay and bisexual people in England and Wales – but not for trans people (Report, 7 April). This document initially only covered sexual orientation. When it was updated to include gender identity, we worked with other signatories to ensure that the memorandum was clear that being opposed to conversion therapy did not mean opposing appropriate clinical interventions for trans and gender-questioning people. This demonstrated that it is possible to deliver a ban on conversion therapy that protects all LGBT people. It is critical that the government comes to this same position.Prof Martin MarshallChair, Royal College of General Practitioners  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/13/2022,"Matthew Taylor, who leads the NHS Confederation, rightly points to the consequences of the government’s “living without restrictions” ideology (Covid threat being ignored in England for ideological reasons, say NHS leaders, 11 April). Boris Johnson sympathises with the libertarian ideologues in his party who like to invoke Ayn Rand. Perhaps they should note the warning attributed to her that “we can evade reality, but we cannot evade the consequences of evading reality”. The insulting response from a No 10 spokesperson to Taylor’s accusation that the NHS feels abandoned shows that Johnson hopes to defy reality, as he has throughout the pandemic. To add further insult, the No 10 spokesperson adds that “we are now able to manage [Covid] as we do with other respiratory infections”, despite the NHS’s daily experience blowing a hole in such Bolsonaro-esque bravado.Calum PatonEmeritus professor of public policy, Keele University  Having followed the progress of the pandemic in the UK closely, I am amazed at the relaxed attitude the government has to a death toll that equates to a Lockerbie disaster daily, or the total number of UK deaths in the Falklands conflict. I am appalled that the government’s response is to close their eyes and put their collective fingers in their ears while all the time humming “la-la-la-de-da”. Public interest has waned to an unfortunate level. The press should be making more noise. Perhaps refining the death statistics to show the age distribution of the current deaths would personalise the numbers.

4/13/2022,"Oliver Wainwright’s otherwise excellent overview of the redevelopment of Sheffield’s Park Hill estate concludes by blaming “the council’s neglect of this public asset” (‘It always felt good here’: how Sheffield’s brutalist Park Hill estate survived the haters and their bulldozers, 7 April). This completely overlooks the battle that took place between Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government and local authorities in the 1980s. A range of measures such as block grants and compulsory competitive tendering ensured that power was transferred to the centre. As this process has continued, it has become increasingly difficult for councils to undertake “municipal pride”-type projects, unless central government approves. Unfortunately, when they are not supported, local authorities are then criticised for being inefficient and wasteful.John KirkwoodSheffield  Having studied art and architecture when I was at school in Sheffield in 1952-65, I enjoyed Oliver Wainwright’s article about the city’s Park Hill development – especially as our teacher included the topic in our subject matter.

4/13/2022,"A police officer who suffered novichok poisoning when he searched the home of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal following the Salisbury nerve agent attack has reached a settlement with his former force. Lawyers for Nick Bailey argued that he continued to suffer from the trauma of the poisoning more than four years on and made a personal injury claim against Wiltshire police. Bailey was the first person to go into Skripal’s home in March 2018 after the former spy and his daughter, Yulia, were poisoned and he spent 17 days in hospital. Patrick Maguire, a partner at Horwich Cohen Coghlan solicitors, which represents Bailey, said in a statement on Tuesday: “Life has never been the same since that day in 2018 for Nick and this feels like a huge step forward in terms of getting some level of closure. Although the last four years have been incredibly challenging for our client, we’re all pleased to have reached this settlement in the end. Nick is proud and privileged to have served in the police and this will never change. “On behalf of Nick and the family we’d like to thank the public from around the world who have supported him as well as his friends, former colleagues and most importantly his family.” Maguire said the terms of the settlement would remain confidential but confirmed it brought the litigation to an end. He added: “All the issues connected to this case have had a major impact, not just on our client and his family, but the nation as a whole.” The settlement means Bailey’s legal team will drop calls for potentially sensitive documents such as handwritten notes made during the police response to be disclosed. Sergei and Yulia Skripal survived the attack but a few months later Dawn Sturgess, 44, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, were poisoned in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, after he found a fake perfume bottle containing novichok. Rowley recovered but Sturgess died on 8 July that year. A public inquiry that will investigate the circumstances of Sturgess’s death has been launched but no date has been set for the first substantive hearings. Bailey left Wiltshire police in October 2020 after 18 years, saying he “couldn’t deal with being in a police environment”. Speaking to Wiltshire college for a podcast last year, Bailey told how he felt “overwhelming guilt” after his family were forced to leave their home because he had contaminated it with the nerve agent. He said: “I remember feeling pure panic and fear of the unknown because I had been poisoned by this nerve agent and you just don’t know where that is going to end. “There was a lot of fear and a lot of guilt because later on down the line while I was in hospital my family were basically told they had to leave our house because I had accidentally taken nerve agent back and contaminated the house.”",News/UK news,Novichok poisonings: Nick Bailey reaches settlement with police force,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/salisbury-novichok-poisonings-nick-bailey-reaches-settlement-wiltshire-police

4/13/2022,"Alice Walker’s earliest childhood memories of the Peak District are of picnics, visits to stately homes and walks with her parents. Years later, Britain’s first national park holds new significance: it was her specialist subject as she became the oldest female winner of Mastermind. The title came as a surprise to the career quizzer: “I don’t really think of myself as an older woman,” admitted Walker, now 67. “But I guess I am.” The retired IT consultant, 66 when she took part, was one of six finalists and won by six points in the grand final which aired on BBC Two on Monday – scoring a perfect 14 out of 14 points on her specialist subject. “It’s an area I’m quite familiar with, I like walking with my dog in the local area,” said Walker, who spent weeks immersing herself in maps, guidebooks and historic sites. “I thought it would be a very interesting subject; I thought it was a bit original as well.” Quizzes are also familiar territory for Walker, who grew up spending Saturday lunches with her parents quizzing one another on subject matters such as their local football grounds. As a student, she had a skill for retaining knowledge – a talent she was aware of from a young age. “I used to do quite well in exams at school; I probably didn’t work as hard as some people throughout the year then I did OK on the exams,” she said. “Annoyingly,” she added sheepishly. But with age came expertise: Mastermind is only one of a few TV quizshows she has been on. Besides taking part in Fifteen to One, The Chase and Eggheads, Walker has also played in a Macclesfield quiz league since the 1980s, and in a Stockport quiz league for fewer years. “I think I might be done with TV quizshows now,” she says, laughing, “because I have done a few.” The first-place position on Mastermind, however, is her first. For years she had considered going on the show, and after a friend made it to the semi-final last year, she thought: “Why not, I’ll just bite the bullet.” Did she think for a moment she’d win? “Never,” she said. While speeding through questions, Walker, like all the show contestants, had no idea of the amount of time remaining or her score. But the best moment, she said, was when the host, Clive Myrie, said the number aloud. “I was literally shocked,” she said. “I knew I’d won at that point.” The Mastermind win had been kept under wraps since November until the show aired. While Walker tried to keep it a secret, telling only her partner and daughter, it was very difficult, she said, to keep it quiet. “I had to keep putting the trophy in the cupboard anytime anyone came around,” she confessed. Nancy Wilkinson became the first winner of Mastermind in 1972. Walker took the title of oldest female winner from Isabelle Heward, who won in 2017 with her specialist subject the life and films of Billy Wilder. Last year, 24-year-old Jonathan Gibson was crowned the youngest-ever champion. Running up to the final, Walker’s specialist subjects were photographer Julia Margaret Cameron, and the musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein. While feeling great – and a bit overwhelmed – Walker said she planned to return to the Peak District in a week or so: “As soon as we get some good weather, I’ll be out walking.”",Arts/Television & radio,"‘I might be done with TV quizshows now,’ says oldest female winner of Mastermind",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/i-might-be-done-with-tv-quizshows-now-says-oldest-female-winner-of-mastermind
4/13/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has rejected a request by the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to visit Kyiv along with other European politicians on Wednesday. Steinmeier, a former foreign minister and erstwhile ally of the ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder, is on a state visit in Poland, where he is discussing the implications of the Russian war in Ukraine with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. According a report in the German newspaper Bild, Steinmeier had planned to travel to Kyiv with the presidents of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland on Wednesday. However, his request for a meeting was rejected by Zelenskiy, with Bild citing the reason as the German Social Democrat’s previously close ties to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his history as an advocate of close Russian-German economic ties. “We all here know Steinmeier’s close ties to Russia, which have also been marked by the Steinmeier formula,” an anonymous Ukrainian diplomat told Bild. “He is currently not welcome in Kyiv. We will see whether that will change one day.” The “Steinmeier formula” was a proposal made by the then foreign minister in 2016 with the intention of breaking a deadlock in negotiations between Ukraine and Russia over peace in eastern Ukraine. The proposal, a simplified version of the Minsk agreements, called for elections in the separatist-held territories under Ukrainian legislation, supervised by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The attempt failed after neither Moscow nor Kyiv implemented the Minsk agreement. On Tuesday afternoon, Steinmeier seemed to confirm that his request for a meeting with Zelenskiy in Kyiv had been rejected by Ukraine. The German president said he had wanted to travel to Kyiv “to send out a strong message of European solidarity with Ukraine”. “I was prepared,” Steinmeier said. “But apparently – and I have to acknowledge this – it was not desired in Kyiv.” The embarrassing rejection comes as Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has come under fire for not having travelled to Ukraine himself so far, unlike the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the EU leader, Ursula von der Leyen. Steinmeier has recently conceded the failure of his past strategy of western rapprochement with Moscow. “My sticking to [the Baltic Sea pipeline project] Nord Stream 2, that was definitely a mistake,” he said in Berlin on 4 April. “We held on to bridges that Russia no longer believed in, and of which our partners warned us.” He added: “We failed to build a common European house. I did not believe Vladimir Putin would embrace his country’s complete economic, political and moral ruin for the sake of his imperial madness.”",News/World news,Ukraine snubs German president over past Russia links,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/ukraine-snubs-german-president-over-past-russia-links
4/13/2022,"Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak cannot continue in their jobs, grieving relatives of Covid victims have said, after it emerged they had received fixed-penalty notices for breaching the lockdown restrictions they imposed on the UK during the pandemic. Several people who lost loved ones said they were “disgusted” with the prime minister, after Downing Street said on Tuesday he was among those penalised. “I just can’t see how he can continue to cling on to power,” said Jean Adamson, whose father, Aldrick, died two years ago on Friday. She said that, while Johnson had been attending lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street, her father “died on his own, on a cold Covid ward without anyone there to hold his hand” because she and her family had followed the rules. “If [Johnson] had any decency or any integrity, then he would have gone,” Adamson said. “He would have gone a long time ago. But, clearly, we have a prime minister here who is self-serving, who is interested in himself and saving his own skin.” Describing her father as a man who had worked hard all his life after arriving in the UK from Barbados aged 19 as a Windrush pioneer, Adamson spoke of her distress at the fact he had not received the funeral he would have wanted. She said her father was a “man of the church” who sang in the choir, as well as serenading his grandchildren and great-grandchildren with West Indian songs, adding: “He was very contented, very cheerful and a robust character; a real pleasure to be around.” She accused Johnson of being “devoid of all integrity”. She said: “I am disgusted. It’s a disgrace that we have a prime minister who, clearly, is not fit for office.” Rivka Gottlieb, whose father, Michael, died two days after Aldrick, agreed that “disgusted” was the correct term. She said the continuing revelations about ministers’ lockdown-breaching parties made her feel like the “wounds have been reopened”. She said: “It’s really devastating for families like ours – after what we went through at the time that these parties were taking place. My dad was dying … and we couldn’t be together to grieve afterwards. We couldn’t hug, we couldn’t comfort each other.” She described her father as a “lovely, lovely person” who was generous, kind and loved to joke and chat. News of the penalties, she said, “confirms what we were suspecting at the time – that the people in charge don’t care. They really didn’t care. That was the culture in Downing Street; partying and boozing and self-interest and not taking it seriously.” Lobby Akinnola, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice , the campaign group to which both Adamson and Gottlieb belong, said: “After everything that’s happened, it’s still unbelievably painful to know that the prime minister was partying and breaking his own lockdown rules, while we were unable to be at our loved ones’ sides in their dying moments, or in miserable funerals with only a handful of people – because we were following the rules. “The fact that the prime minister and his chancellor then lied about it and would have continued to do so if the police hadn’t intervened is truly shameless. They broke the law. But, even worse, they took us all for mugs. “When we met the PM in the No 10 garden – the same one where they had these parties – he looked us in the eyes and said he had done everything he could to save our loved ones. We now know that that was a lie. “There is simply no way either the prime minister or the chancellor can continue. Their dishonesty has caused untold hurt to the bereaved. Not only that, but they have lost all credibility with the wider public, which could cost lives if new variants mean restrictions are needed in the future. If they had any decency they would be gone by tonight.”",News/Politics,"Johnson and Sunak must go, say ‘disgusted’ families of Covid victims",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/12/johnson-and-sunak-must-go-disgusted-covid-victims-families
4/13/2022,"Nearly 20 years ago now, two feckless teenage girls ruled the comedy zeitgeist: Matt Lucas’s Vicky Pollard, an obnoxious young mother who once swapped one of her many children for a Westlife CD, and Catherine Tate’s ridiculously defensive working-class schoolgirl Lauren Cooper. Both had playground-friendly catchphrases – “Yeah but no but” and “Am I bovvered?”, respectively – and both starred in extremely popular sketch shows. Sketch shows that don’t seem quite so funny now. That’s if they ever were. Rather than retroactive hand-wringing, the cultural reckoning (content warnings, removal of certain scenes, much social media discourse) currently being experienced by the grotesque strain of 00s comedy that included Little Britain and The Catherine Tate Show stems largely from how uncomfortable it made many feel at the time. These shows existed in an era when comedy was preoccupied with needling the boundaries of acceptability, and their creators understood that sending up the idea of prejudice – making fun of bigoted people, but also playing racism, misogyny, homophobia and classism for laughs – was precisely where transgression became tolerable (for TV executives, at least). Although Tate’s generally very well-observed sketches weren’t as extreme as Little Britain’s blackface-heavy fare, certain streamers still require they be accompanied by disclaimers about racist and homophobic material. Many of those warnings apply to the rants of Tate’s foul-mouthed Nan character, something that makes the existence of The Nan Movie – roundly panned upon its release last month – seem downright bizarre. Whoever thought that sensationally untimely concept was a good idea was clearly kidding themselves. But Hard Cell (Netflix), Tate’s new six-part mockumentary is a clean slate, and far less of a foregone conclusion. Set in a women’s prison, it sees the chameleonic actor play six different characters: Laura, a performatively woke governor fixated on fostering inmates’ creativity (and her own upcoming Ted talk on the subject); Marco, a vain, wise-cracking guard; plus, three prisoners and one of their mothers. Tate is clearly in her element, disappearing wholesale into her creations (her transformation into Marco in particular is spookily convincing). The tone is brash, jolly and occasionally disturbing: Orange Is the New Black meets Summer Heights High. The question is not so much what could go wrong – this kind of unsubtle character comedy will never be foolproof – but whether there is any chance this might, just possibly, go right. Unfortunately, there are problems from the start. The Office’s influence on British comedy may remain inescapable, but Laura’s deputy, Dean, (Christian Brassington) is far too obviously a knock-off Tim: perennially amused by his pompous boss’s stupidity, but also determined to spell out the subtext of every cynical grimace and drolly delivered prank. There is zero nuance here. The main trick he plays on Laura is referring to himself as her “number two”, prompting her to unwittingly repeat a series of double entendres about going to the toilet. It’s a joke that recurs so many times over the first few episodes that it starts to take on an almost surreal, hallucinatory quality. By the 500th occasion, you’re not sure whether to laugh or cry. Repetition is the bedrock of Hard Cell, which is tied to Tate’s catchphrase-heavy heyday. The characters are largely solitary-joke skits in themselves. This is certainly true of Tate’s pathologically violent Scottish prisoner, Big Viv, who is obsessed with doing impressions of the Kardashian clan – all consisting entirely of the phrase “I’m excited”, delivered in exactly the same tone. Sometimes, though, incessant repetition does bear fruit. The show’s main storyline sees the actor Cheryl Fergison – AKA Heather from EastEnders – help the prisoners put on a musical, and every time Laura mistakes her for one of the inmates, it gets a little bit funnier. The faux-enlightened (really, just irresponsible and self-important) governor aside, much of the comedy in Hard Cell feels distinctly – and often unpleasantly – retro. There are plenty of gross-out moments, such as the prison’s sewage system breaks and one agonisingly long masturbation mime. There is an over-reliance on lazy regional stereotypes, too: an Irish inmate, also played by Tate, who is creepily obsessed with her “mammy”, and “subtitled” Welsh prisoner, Sian, who Laura cannot understand – a lame and dispiriting gag that requires Sian to mumble her words and bizarrely mangle her intonation lest viewers decipher a single word she says. Some of the material in Hard Cell will be a matter of taste – and with the gag rate as high as it is, a fair amount does inevitably land. But what is objectively lacking is an actual plot to chivvy the action along (“will the prisoners manage to stage their musical?!” doesn’t really cut it). Or rather, a plot that doesn’t wait until the last five minutes of the entire series to make itself known. The twists and developments in those final moments are genuinely shocking; this could have been a far more compelling show had they happened earlier on. Tate might be a veteran character comedian but Hard Cell is her first attempt at a sitcom – and thanks to a lacklustre narrative and an abundance of one-dimensional characters, it really shows.",Arts/Television & radio,Hard Cell review – Catherine Tate’s first attempt at a sitcom is lacklustre,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/12/hard-cell-review-catherine-tates-first-attempt-at-a-sitcom-is-lacklustre
4/13/2022,"A key Russian railway bridge has been damaged in the border region with Ukraine in a potential act of sabotage as Russia relies on its railroads to shift its attacking forces in preparation for a massive assault on eastern Ukraine. Photographs from the bridge in Russia’s Belgorod region showed that section of rail had been forced upward, possibly due to an explosion. The photographs, as well as news of the incident, were first published on Tuesday by the local Russian governor and local media. “There are no casualties,” governor Vyacheslav Gladkov wrote in an online statement. “Only the railway track is destroyed… I will inform you about the reasons later.” The incident comes as Russia has begun militarising its border regions near Ukraine by raising threat alerts, erecting military checkpoints and mobilising local townspeople in a sign that Russia’s war effort is shifting toward east Ukraine. Ukraine has not confirmed if it stands behind the attack on the railway bridge, which commentators said would make sense as a cross-border raid meant to slow Russia’s shifting of heavy artillery and other military vehicles needed to prepare for an assault in Ukraine’s Donbas region. Russia relies heavily on railroads to move its military equipment. The bridge sits just four miles from the border on a rail-line that goes south into Ukraine and lies on a supply line between Russia and the territory it holds near the city of Izyum near the Donbas. Ukrainian intelligence have warned that Russia may be preparing “false flag” attacks that could justify a new offensive in coming weeks. Vladimir Putin on Tuesday said the war would continue “until its full completion and we achieve our goals,” blaming the west for forcing Russia to attack Ukraine. He also denied evidence that Russian soldiers committed war crimes in the Ukrainian town of Bucha. Ukrainian officials said that Russia may seek to drive public opinion in support of the war by staging attacks that can then be blamed on Ukraine. “Russian intelligence services are planning a series of terrorist attacks with bombing and compromising residential buildings, hospitals and schools in Russian settlements,” said Maj Gen Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, in a statement. He added that Belgorod, along with cities in Crimea, could be among those cities targeted. “Trenches are actively being dug in the Belgorod and Kursk regions, there is panic about about an imaginary attack of Ukrainian volunteer battalions and diversion groups,” he said. Russia previously claimed that Ukraine had targeted a fuel dump in a helicopter raid earlier this month. Ukraine denied responsibility for that attack, with a senior official saying that “whatever happens on Russia’s territory is Russia’s responsibility.” As Russia shifts its military toward the east, there are signs that the military is increasing controls in its border regions. Six Russian regions on the border with Ukraine raised their terrorist threat levels on Monday, citing fears of “provocations.” Photographs showed that new vehicle checkpoints had been erected in the Kursk and Belgorod regions, with police stopping drivers and performing car searches. In Belgorod, a Russian city that sits just 18 miles from the border, the mayor called on Tuesday for locals to join neighbourhood watch groups. “Duties… include patrolling the streets in the evening and at night, as well as helping the police to ensure law and order,” the order said, according to state media. The Belgorod region has also banned the use of firecrackers and fireworks “so as not to frighten people with unnecessary loud sounds,” reports said. Russia’s railroads appear particularly vulnerable during the buildup. So-called “railway rebels” in Belarus performed more than a dozen acts of sabotage during the early weeks of the war, in an effort to disrupt supply trains travelling from Belarus to Russian units stationed in northern Ukraine. The attacks on relay switches and other infrastructure had briefly shut down major routes, including the train line from Minsk to the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv. In January, Belarusian cyber-partisans opposed to Alexander Lukashenko told the Guardian that they had hacked the country’s railway system in an effort to derail the Russian military buildup that preceded its invasion of Ukraine.",News/World news,Key Russian railway bridge destroyed in Belgorod border region with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/key-russian-railway-bridge-destroyed-in-belgorod-border-region-with-ukraine
4/13/2022,"Canada’s finance minister has described the country’s out-of-control housing prices as an “intergenerational injustice”, as political leaders struggle to rein in a spiralling affordability crisis. Chrystia Freeland, who also serves as Canada’s deputy prime minister, said the issue is her top domestic concern. “We had a better shot at buying a home and starting a family than young people today, and we cannot have a Canada where the rising generation is shut out of the dream of home ownership,” she told reporters Monday, calling the current situation a “shock”. Canada has the largest gap between incomes and house prices in the G7, according to the OECD, and two of its large cities, Vancouver and Toronto, often appear in rankings of global real estate bubbles. In February, the country recorded its highest ever average selling price for a house, C$816,720 (US$647,340 or £497,101), with prices up 20% over the last year. The province of Nova Scotia had the largest increase of any region, with house prices leaping 35% since last year. The city of Kingston, Ontario, recorded the highest increase, with prices jumping 44%. Politicians and economists have increasingly grown worried that such increases aren’t sustainable, but experts say there are no quick fixes to the crisis, which has been driven in part by low interest rates, market speculation and a shortage of new housing. The Liberal government budget announced last week implemented a two-year ban on foreign house purchases in an effort to tame runaway prices. It also promised to invest C$10.14bn in housing and said it will accelerate the pace at which new houses are built, with Freeland blaming low housing stock as a prominent driver of price increases. “We cannot have the fastest growing population in the G7 without also having the fastest growing housing stock,” she said. Elected officials have increasingly made housing affordability the central focus of their re-election campaigns. Ontario premier Doug Ford, who faces voters in June, has blamed cities for slow zoning processes, arguing delays drive up costs. “Believe it or not, folks, sometimes when [developers] apply for a permit, it can take four to six years,” he said late last year. “Where in North America does it take four to six years?” Conservative leadership candidate Pierre Poilievre has also made housing affordability a top focus of his campaign. In viral video shot over the weekend in Vancouver the frontrunner blamed “big city gatekeepers”, alleging the system was meant to keep real estate investors wealthy. On Tuesday, Statistics Canada released new data highlighting the “inequalities” in the country’s housing market. Figures collected by the national agency found that “multiple-property owners possess nearly one-third of all residential properties” and that “the top 10% wealthiest owners account for around one-quarter of residential housing value”.",News/World news,"Housing prices are an ‘intergenerational injustice’, says Canada’s deputy PM",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/canada-housing-prices-chrystia-freeland
4/13/2022,"George Boughey will “have a roll of the dice” in the hope of landing a first Group One and Classic success in the 1,000 Guineas next month after Cachet stretched two-and-a-half lengths clear of her rivals in the Group Three Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket on Tuesday. Cachet did not add to her debut win in a Newmarket maiden in May as a two-year-old last season, but ran well in a series of Group races, finishing third in the Group One Fillies’ Mile and fourth in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, and stayed on well in the seven-furlong contest after hitting the front well over two furlongs out. As a daughter of Aclaim, whose offspring have an average winning distance of 6.1 furlongs, Cachet is not certain to get the mile in the Guineas, but Boughey, who is in only his third full season with a licence, is eager to give her the chance. “I kept saying at the back end of last year that she was slightly weak and she did incredibly well over the winter,” Boughey said. “She went to Del Mar and had 10 days on the walker and didn’t miss a day from then until now, which is a huge attribute for her. “We’ve been able to get the work in when we’ve wanted and while she was fit today, she will step forward again. She’s obviously a high-class filly and we’ll come back here for the Guineas and give it a good go. “The mile is the question mark, but she loves the track here which is a huge string to her bow. All systems go for the Guineas with this filly.” Master Of The Seas, beaten a short-head by Poetic Flare in last year’s 2,000 Guineas, returned to action as a four-year-old gelding with a comfortable success in the Earl Of Sefton Stakes. Charlie Appleby’s four-year-old wore a hood in the preliminaries and was far more settled before and during the race than in several of his starts last season. “I would be thinking, miss the Lockinge and work back from the Queen Anne [at Royal Ascot],” Appleby said. “We could find a stepping stone, but if not, I’d be happy to go straight to Ascot.” It is a rarity these days for last season’s champion two-year-old colt return to action in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket – Toormore, in 2014, was the last to do so – but Charlie Appleby feels that Native Trail (3.35), the clear favourite for the 2,000 Guineas on 30 April, will come on for the run ahead and it will be fascinating to see him step back on to the track on Wednesday afternoon. Like Appleby’s Pinatubo, the outstanding juvenile of 2019, Native Trail concluded his two-year-old season with a wide-margin win in the National Stakes before following up in the Dewhurst on Future Champions day. That form gives today’s six opponents at least 17lb to find on Timeform’s ratings and while the last two odds-on shots for the Craven were beaten, it will be a bitterly disappointing opening to the new Flat campaign if Native Trail is a third. Newmarket 1.15 Six of the nine runners are making their racecourse debut so it is very much one to watch with an eye on the future, but Ameynah showed enough on her debut over course and distance last year to suggest she should go close with normal improvement. Among the newcomers, Enshrine probably has the most interesting pedigree: her dam was a half-sister to the top-class US turf performer, Lady Eli. Newmarket 1.50 Pocket The Profit went from strength to strength in nurseries last season and took another big step forward on his return to action at Pontefract, winning by nearly five lengths easing down while still recording an excellent time. The ground was heavy there but he had strong winning form on good-to-soft last season and will be very hard to beat under a 6lb penalty. Newmarket 2.25 The market could have plenty to say about these unraced three-year-olds and it is hardly a contest that demands a bet, but Archie Watson has a 24pc strike-rate and a healthy level-stakes profit with three-year-olds making their racecourse debut so Noble Anthem, a son of Starspangledbanner, could be one to consider.

4/13/2022,"A duck haphazardly flying into the jaws of a sitting bear and a witty depiction of the effects of arts funding cuts are among the winning entries to this year’s young cartoonist of the year competition. The Cartoon Museum and the British Cartoonists’ Association announced the winners on Tuesday after receiving more than 150 entries. The under-18s category winner was 13-year-old Rohan Rooney from Trim in County Meath, Ireland, who produced the image of a duck heading into a gleeful bear’s mouth. Looking over its shoulder, the duck says: “Pear? What do you mean, pear?” The under-30s competition was won by 22-year-old Cara Grainger from Stoke-on-Trent, whose cartoon is a spliced depiction of two people on a sofa. On one half of the image, a fully illustrated man holding a newspaper reads: “It says here that the government has cut funding for arts courses by 50%.” On the other half, a stick figure reacts with a suitably expressionless face – a comment on the repercussions of failure to support artists. The Woodcock prize went to nine-year-old Bianca Hsu from London, who drew a cat leaping across a kitchen to get its paws on a sausage. All three will receive prize money and a certificate, which will be presented to them at the Cartoon Museum in London in May, alongside an exhibition of winners and runners-up. Martin Rowson, the chair of the British Cartoonists’ Association, said: “For the last 21 years I’ve always joked that the real purpose of the annual young cartoonist competition is to remind everyone that ours is a crowded and frequently beleaguered profession and that the last thing we need is competition from the whippersnappers. So this way we can identify the best ones and break their fingers. “And if it’s the kind of gag which causes offence to the winners, that sort of suggests they’ve chosen the wrong path in life. But to be serious for a fleeting second, the wealth of talent which we see coming up each and every year shows cartooning is alive, kicking and screaming, just like it should be.” The competition was originally the Mel Calman young cartoonist competition, in memory of the Times cartoonist and Cartoon Arts Trust founder. In 2001 it morphed into its current form, led by Rowson, who recruited judges from each national newspaper. Now in its 26th year, the competition has produced winners including Nick Edwards (2009), who went on to win an Emmy for his work on Uncle Grandpa in the US, the New Yorker cartoonist Will McPhail, and the political cartoonist Matt Buck. The director of the Cartoon Museum, Joe Sullivan, said the competition was “so important to the museum and to the cartooning community, encouraging young artists to pick up a pencil and draw a cartoon, and displaying the very best on our walls alongside the greats of Hogarth, Gillray, Darly, Low, and the rest”.",Arts/Culture,Doomed duck and arts cuts among themes of young cartoonists of year,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/12/doomed-duck-arts-cuts-themes-young-cartoonists-year
