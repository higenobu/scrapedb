5/1/2022,"In his elaborately discursive way, Lonnie Holley is telling me about the first time he set foot on Orford Ness, a 10-mile-long shingle spit on the Suffolk coast earlier this year. Now a protected nature reserve, it is an austere, windblown landscape of deserted roads and the shells of military buildings, the residue of its former use as a military testing site during the first and second world wars. “Stepping off the boat and walking over the levee to encounter all these strange structures, my brain was taking me all over the place,” he says, his eyes widening at the memory. “I’ve always wandered deep into ruins, but this was something different. I could feel the energy. I could feel it.” What was it he felt, exactly? His brow furrows and he stares intently at me. “All the workers that cried when they were working out there. They wanted to go home so bad, they cried. They didn’t want to be there, but they knew they had a job to do. I could feel that, and it kind of scared me.” Holley, a 72-year-old self-taught American artist and musician, spent several weeks in rural Suffolk in February, having been commissioned by Artangel, an organisation that specialises in often ambitious site-specific artworks, to create a song cycle inspired by the landscape of Orford Ness. On one of his visits he composed and performed a piece called I Built a Trigger, But I Didn’t Pull It. Like all his songs, it was improvised on the spot and possesses a raw, soulful intensity that has much to do with the plaintive grain of his voice and the incantatory nature of his delivery. When I ask him about the title, he says: “The workers who knew how to create the weapons were the experts, they didn’t pull the triggers. It all went from hand to hand, from a lower to a higher command, and then finally the trigger was pulled. That’s how it goes and, right now, we are so far ahead of ourselves with digital triggers that can rain down missiles from far away. We’re so busy playing at future dwellers, we don’t have the time to look back at history in order to learn what it was that has allowed everything to become what it is.” Like his art, Holley’s conversation does not adhere to conventional rules of form and structure, tending instead towards the abstract and tangential. “Lonnie’s concentration is wayward and his thoughts are associative,” says Artangel’s Michael Morris. “He is not disciplined in the way we expect artists to be, but that does not mean his art is undisciplined. In a way, his art is his training, because he is constantly working things through. It’s performative, but there is nothing contrived about it, which is very rare.” Holley has been variously described as an “outsider artist”, a “folk” artist, a shaman and a visionary. His sculptures, fashioned from metal, wire, wood, concrete and all manner of discarded objects, seem to place him in a lineage of compulsive creative otherness that includes fellow Alabamans Bill Traylor and Sister Gertrude Morgan. Musically, he has been compared to late performers like the troubled Daniel Johnston, whose songs often possess a childlike purity of expression, and RL Burnside, a “primitive” blues singer whose wild, wayward life echoed through his raucous music. None of these comparisons quite work, though, not least because, whether composing songs on the spot or making art from what he calls “other folk’s trash, garbage and debris”, Holley seems to exist in a state of constant creative spontaneity. “One of the most extraordinary things about Lonnie is that he is entirely in the present tense all of the time,” says Morris. “It is quite an incredible thing to witness him perform, not least because he cannot do a song twice. It’s one take and that’s it.” Later, when I ask Matt Arnett, Holley’s manager and longtime friend, if a forthcoming London performance by Holley will feature the songs he created out on the shingle at Orford Ness, he replies: “I have no idea what will happen on the night, because every live show that Lonnie does is a unique thing that exists only in that moment. What I can tell you is that it will be a tightrope walk, because it always is.” The performance in question will launch both Artangel’s online film, The Edge of What, in which Holley performs five songs at different locations on Orford Ness, and an exhibition of his recent paintings and sculptures, The Growth of Communication, at the Edel Assanti gallery in London. Both events attest to Lonnie Holley’s unlikely journey from the margins to the mainstream of the art world. On the day I meet with him, he has just finished filming on Orford Ness and is sitting quietly in a vast barn-cum-studio, which has been his base for several weeks. He is surrounded by his work, elaborate assemblages and abstract paintings. Most of them have been transported from Atlanta, Georgia, where he is now based, but some, he tells me, were made from materials he gathered in Suffolk and on a previous sojourn in Margate. Around his feet are scattered several bags and boxes of raw materials – electrical wires, coloured ribbons, driftwood, pieces of plastic and tin, strips of fabric and mesh, and even a small selection of pulled-up plants and roots. “That’s my background material,” he says. Dressed in a striped work shirt, paint-spattered trousers, a long scarf and a brightly coloured woolly hat, Holley resembles a Rastafarian elder, albeit one possessed of an innocent, almost childlike, sense of wonder at the world and his unlikely place in it. Initially, he seems quiet and withdrawn, perhaps exhausted from several hours spent out on the peninsula in near freezing temperatures. Distracted by a photoshoot being set up in the corner, he proposes we sit outside in a car so “we can get some noise-free information for the tape recorder”. I begin by asking him about his first impressions of Orford Ness. “It made me think of the times of kingdoms,” he says. “Especially here in the UK, where you have kept the actual castles as historical evidence of back then. It also made me wonder about our journey to the moon and, from there, to Mars. What will our structures look like that we leave behind, because we have a tendency to leave so much behind, not just on Earth, but in space, too. We discard so much and just walk away from it because we think nature is gonna take care of it, but it ain’t. That’s what a lot of our problems are about.” In song and in conversation, the fate of the planet is one of Holley’s preoccupations, alongside his tumultuous family history, the American civil rights struggle of the 1960s, and, perhaps most surprisingly, his admiration for the Queen. “I wasn’t there for her inauguration/ I wasn’t there for her celebration/ but I’m around when her birthday comes...” he sings on the surreal, but heartfelt Six Space Shuttles and 144,000 Elephants, perhaps the only paean to the British monarchy that is also an ecological sci-fi parable. It imagines the Queen leaving Earth on a spaceship, “the size of the Hindenburg and the Titanic, both put together”, and returning from her trip around the cosmos with the power “to heal the ground... heal the air, and fix the waters, too”. Arnett was a teenager when he first met Holley in the 1980s, through his father, Bill, an avid collector and champion of “outsider” art. “Lonnie was the first person I ever heard talking about acid rain and pollution,” he recalls. “He lived in creeks, ditches and valleys, all the places that were first affected by toxic run-off and climate change. He saw what was coming. Back then, people thought he was just the crazy guy in the corner, but almost everything he was saying has come to pass.” Holley’s life story is, by any standards, remarkable. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1950, the seventh of 27 children, and, in his telling, raised until the age of four by a travelling burlesque dancer, who then reputedly sold him to another family for a pint of whiskey. At some point in his childhood, he was hit by a car, dragged for several blocks and, having been pronounced brain-dead, spent several months in a coma. When he recovered, he was committed to the notorious Alabama Industrial School for Negro Children in Mount Meigs, which Arnett describes as “a hellish place, basically a slave camp for black children”. In his late 20s, Holley began making art in response to a great personal tragedy – the death of two of his sister’s children in a fire. Realising that the family could not afford to pay for their gravestones, he made them from discarded sandstone blocks salvaged from a local foundry. “It was like a spiritual awakening,” he told the New York Times last year. “I had been thrown away as a child, and here I was building something out of unwanted things in memorial of my little nephew and niece. I discovered art as service.” That act of acknowledgment and remembrance seems to have been the beginning of Holley’s compulsive need to create. His yard and the land around his house in Birmingham soon became a sprawling outdoor workshop-cum-studio, with the early sandstone carvings giving way to more elaborate sculptures made from salvaged materials. When he tells me his work is honouring “the ones that went before”, he is not only talking about the courage of the black civil rights leaders he holds in awe, but the resilience and determination of his parents and grandparents, whose physical labour is echoed in his work. “My mama would get up early in the morning and go to the city lot just before the break of day,” he tells me. “That’s when the trucks would come from all over the city, start bringing all of their trash, garbage and debris to dump it for landfill. She’d work there with my Uncle Jesse, just ricking out the copper, brass, aluminium and the tin, whatever they could take their sledgehammer to, and beat down. They’d put it into barrels and haul it to the junk yard. I saw them do it, and I inherited a lot from them. It’s like I’ve been programmed.” It was Bill Arnett who, after visiting Holley’s yard in the mid-1980s, brought him to the attention of the wider American art world. “My dad saw what nobody else saw,” says Matt Arnett. “He didn’t think Lonnie was crazy, he thought he was a genius and he pushed that idea on to me.” In his turn, Matt also saw, or more precisely heard, what no one else had, coaxing Holley into a makeshift recording studio in an old church in Alabama in 2006, having listened to some cassettes in his car that the artist had made of himself singing while he worked. “They were songs that took up one entire side of an old 90- minute cassette, and sometimes two whole sides,” recalls Arnett. “Just raw recordings of Lonnie singing about the news of the day and what was happening in his life. It was very similar to his art in many ways, but it took me a while to make that connection.” The studio was “just a basic set-up, two keyboards and a microphone, and, out of thin air, Lonnie sang Six Space Shuttles and 144,000 Elephants. I remember my friend, Amos, and I just looked at each other, open-mouthed,” Arnett says. “It was one of those ‘Holy fucking shit!’ moments. Just unreal.” Holley subsequently released his debut album, Just Before Music, on the archival Dust-to-Digital label in 2012, aged 62. Three critically acclaimed albums have followed, as well as a collaboration with a younger musician, Matthew E White. Holley’s compositions range from often dissonant and disturbing state-of-the-nation reportage – I Woke Up in a Fucked-Up America – to beautifully tender, meandering ballads such as All Rendered Truth. “We call what Lonnie does improvisation, because we don’t have a better word for it,” says Arnett, “but it’s more complex than that. He has a photographic memory, for a start. He has told me that, when he’s on stage, it’s like a bunch of carousels are spinning around in his head, and he is able to pull images and ideas from all these memories and experiences that are spinning past.” I ask Lance Ledbetter, founder of Dust-to-Digital, if it was difficult to record Holley, given that there are no second takes. “He’s pretty out there in that regard, but when something as magical as that is happening, you don’t want to inhibit the process in any way,” he says. “I’ve actually come to think of it as all one continuous song that just pours out of him. We specialise in finding adventurous music but, for us, hearing Lonnie Holley for the first time was akin to discovering a new planet.” In the barn, Holley guides me through his creations, by turns animated and thoughtful. At least two works seem to reference police shootings of black men: an old-fashioned tailor’s dummy with pistols embedded in its torso and, more intriguingly, a wooden rack for drying clothes, on which he has suspended paper targets taken from military rifle ranges. Each target is held in place by clothes pegs and several are peppered by actual bullet holes. “This is what I call a centre-floor piece,” he says. “You need to be able to move around it to see it. It’s about what’s been going on, how we ain’t nothing but targets. You can become a target just because you’re out there. That’s all it takes. But I made it domestic as an indicator of how our mothers and our grandmothers cared for us children enough to put our clothes on the line. But then they see their children grow up and become targets. What I’m saying is, the whole thing is repeating itself.” Moving around the piece, he recalls a song he wrote for his 2018 album, MITH, that begins “I’m a suspect in America,” and ends, “I’m a dust speck in the universe”. Then he is off again, on another tangential chain of thought. So it is that the cultural and the cosmic, the domestic and the political, all merge, and find unique expression, in Lonnie Holley’s wildly associative, deeply attentive imagination. One suspects that would be the case whether or not anyone was looking or listening.  Lonnie Holley: The Growth of Communication is at Edel Assanti, 13 May-2 July.

5/1/2022,"It’s been two years since Kehlani’s last album, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t, debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200. For an artist who once competed in America’s Got Talent, they have managed to create an identity that feels authentic and, well, cool. On their third project, the Oakland-born singer delivers an onslaught of glistening vocals in 13 tracks that are mostly yearning. The opener, Little Story, is a pared-down, guitar-heavy number in which Kehlani talks about a relationship that feels unresolved. “I want you to love me again,” they sing. Tracks such as Any Given Sunday are narrative-heavy – verses are anecdotes and choruses are questions for old and new lovers. Lyrics such as “Is it really cheating if she ain’t loving me right?” on More Than I Should stand out for their ruthlessness. While Everything glows with simple, celestial harmonies, Wish I Never provides a welcome respite from this slow and sensual body of work. It samples Montell Jordan’s 90s classic This is How We Do It.

5/1/2022,"On the streets of Enniskillen, a handful of twentysomething women, all from a unionist background, discuss this week’s elections. The Northern Ireland protocol does not come up once, but what does surface repeatedly among 18- to 34-year-olds asked open questions about their voting intentions is the frustration with the framing of this election, like many before it, as a vote on the constitutional question of whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK or unify with Ireland. “It’s the scaremongering I don’t like. People telling you you have to vote DUP to keep the other side out,” says one 25-year-old worker who wanted to remain anonymous. “I’m a unionist, but I’m not going to be influenced by that protocol stuff. What’s important for me is the health stuff. You have to stand up for women’s issues, that’s important,” she adds, shorthand for why she is not voting for the DUP. “To be honest I think all the parties have let everyone down. I’ve been waiting for two weeks just to get an appointment with the GP,” she says. She is a “from a unionist background” but voted remain and says she will probably vote for the Ulster Unionist party because of “things like abortion and women’s issues”. She has no interest in the constitutional question and the tribal voting. “Until people stop viewing things as unionist or nationals, Northern Ireland will never change,” she says. The Enniskillen straw poll shows that young people, who have no memory of the Troubles, yearn for a day when polarised nationalist-versus-unionist arguments, which polls show are popular with older voters, are over. “I was brought up a Protestant but I’m not really that influenced by that. Me and my siblings will vote for progression rather than religion,” says her friend. Down the street are young parents Grace Hoy, a primary school teacher who is looking at voting for the Green party, and her physiotherapist husband, Mark, who is looking at an independent “cross community” candidate, Donal O’Cofaigh. “It’s just a bit of a circus this election,” says Grace, 27. “People focus too much on stopping the other side getting in. I’m not voting for people who want to bicker or fight over these silly issues. “The issues for me are healthcare, the lack of childcare, support for young families.” Away from the headline battles between Sinn Féin and the DUP and the turmoil within unionism, the question for post-conflict Northern Ireland is whether constitutional politics will ever be remote enough to be in the rear-view mirror. A LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph in March put the combined support for the Alliance party, the Green party and other non-aligned rivals such as People Before Profit at 24%, with their most recent survey results on Friday showing a slight fall to 21%. It is a sizeable chunk compared with Sinn Féin at 26% and the DUP at 20%, according to the poll commissioned by the Belfast Telegraph, but is it enough? The Alliance party will be the sanctuary for many votes eschewing the constitutional political positioning of the main parties, with some predicting they could add between three and five seats to their existing eight. It will mean a larger presence in Stormont, but with 90 seats to be taken it will still be a minority. “This is not going to be the election where people cross the Rubicon in significant numbers,” says Peter Shirlow, director of the Institute of Irish studies at the University of Liverpool. “People say they’re fed up, say they want it all to stop. They don’t want the election to be about the legacy, they want the end to arguing, they want a different assembly, but the thing about it is, most of the people who feel that way is they don’t vote.” However, he believes the proportional representation system could deliver some results for those in the middle. “What we are seeing is there is a growth for those non-constitutional parties, but where they’re very strong is in second preferences. That could theoretically be a gamechanger,” he says. Launching the Alliance party’s manifesto last week, Naomi Long, its leader, expressed frustration that those who support the non-aligned parties do not have the same voice as the unionists and nationalists because of the consociational system set up for post-conflict powersharing. She said she wanted an end to the system whereby members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) are designated as unionist, nationalist or other. “About 15% of MLAs currently are non-aligned in the assembly, yet we still count for less in votes on key issues. We cannot say that our community are all equal if within the heart of the institutions which govern this place there is inequality and disrespect for people’s rights. “I believe that the days of designations are over. The Good Friday agreement allowed us an opportunity to manage our divisions, but surely as a society that cannot be the ceiling of our ambitions.”",News/UK news,‘It’s a bit of a circus’: the Northern Irish voters tired of polarised politics,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/its-a-bit-of-a-circus-the-northern-irish-voters-tired-of-polarised-politics
5/1/2022,"It would be hard to imagine a more sinister sequence of self-portraits than those lurking at the start of this riveting Walter Sickert survey at Tate Britain. The artist paints himself glowering in a miasma of shadows, one eye homing in on you like a target. He hovers menacingly behind a bust of a bare-knuckle boxer. He is a grizzled Lazarus attacking his first posthumous meal, a man in a bowler hat tipped at an angle to match his barbed and sarcastic glare. Or he is a single arm, barring the way between a nude model and what might be us – or, more frighteningly, the exit. This is how Sickert (1860-1942) wished to be seen and known: as a man who must never be taken for granted, a disrupter, an actor, a menace, a taunt. The self-portrait in the bowler hat, painted when the artist was 46 years old, is facetiously subtitled The Juvenile Lead. But it always feels as if Sickert is mocking the viewer as much as himself. For it is too easy to describe him as a theatrical artist. Sickert started out on the stage, after all, playing minor roles for the actor-manager Sir Henry Irving. His art is undoubtedly garrulous, ostentatious, even sensational. He painted London theatres over and again: tiers of balconies rearing upwards like vertiginous cliffs, workers pressing precariously through the railings in the gods, rows of dark faces barely lit by the limelight far below. The singer Ada Lundberg belts it out to a gawping crowd at Marylebone music hall. In the footlights of the Tivoli, the actor Minnie Cunningham turns into a glowing scarlet ghost. Tate Britain is showing Sickert’s 1906 Gallery of the Old Mogul, in which the black backs of men craning forwards to see block out all but a corner of luminous grey screen: what may be our first painting of a movie. In later life he even painted scenes from productions of Shakespeare. But the question is what Sickert is staging in his own theatre, that dank land of rented rooms, sickly streets and gaslit pubs where men and women are at stalemate. The aesthetic origins are clear enough. Sickert – half Danish, student of Whistler, friend of Degas, admirer of Bonnard – continually aspires to European modernism. The debts are everywhere visible in the show. The most famous painting here, Ennui, pays direct homage to Degas’s drinkers stalled over their absinthe in Paris cafes with more than just its French title. Five feet high, it is an immense snapshot of suicidal boredom. The glassy-eyed man lolls over his half-empty pint at the table; the woman leans on the chest of drawers, staring straight at the imprisoning walls. Next to her is a case of stuffed birds, trapped in a bell jar of their own. “It is all over with them,” wrote Virginia Woolf, imagining that innumerable dull days had crushed them like “an avalanche of rubbish.” But the scene is conspicuously staged (to be reprised four more times), and eagle-eyed visitors will recognise the same models in other paintings. Hubby, as he was called, seems to have been an acquaintance of Sickert who had fallen on hard times; Marie was his cleaning lady. He has these working people pose again and again. Hubby is just edging out of the scene on the way to the pub, just arriving, or terminally slumped. He reappears, with his sleeves menacingly rolled, over a naked woman on a bed in one of the so-called Camden Town nudes. Tate Britain has not shied away from showing a whole gallery of these paintings, which are shot through with suppressed malevolence – a horrible aura of voyeurism, encroachment or outright violence. The relationship between the prone and naked woman and the clothed man, seated or standing, is disturbing enough. But in at least one painting, the notorious L’Affaire de Camden Town, the female body looks beaten like a heap of purpling meat in the gloom, and she is either shielding herself from the man above her, or she is already dead. Sickert so often fudged (or simply fumbled) human anatomy that the question is how hard he worked to achieve this dark ambiguity. The title of this particular work refers to the murder of a woman named Emily Dimmock in Camden Town in 1907. Sickert’s paintings are a queasy conflation of crime scene, studio setup and social history, and he liked to confuse things further with deflecting titles. One picture is called What Shall We Do for the Rent? The last essay in the show’s excellent catalogue presents some forensic evidence about Sickert himself. It turns out that he was one of many people who wrote hoax letters to the police pretending to be Jack the Ripper. The coincidence between this revolting act and his paintings seems (to me at least) to lie in the emotional limitations of Sickert’s art. Whatever is happening to his subjects, it only ever seems at first – and sometimes last – like a pretext for forms, for shapemaking and design, for a startling palette running incandescent to dun, ultimately for the fascination of brushmarks. Mood is more important than meaning, tonal harmonies more than mankind. Of course there are exceptions where everything unites. In 1915, Sickert painted the Brighton Pierrots performing at dusk to an audience of almost empty deckchairs on the front. It is a hectic interplay of lime green, sulphur and pink in which the performers’ faces – typically featureless – are rouged by gaslight and dying sun. The gunfire of the western front could already be heard, at times, along the south coast. The picture has a brilliantly false end-of-the-pier gaiety. This show is superbly curated to give you Sickert whole. It does not ignore the repetitive tedium of his Whistlerian nocturnes or his roseate Venetian facades. It includes paintings by Bonnard and Degas that reveal just how much Sickert borrowed from his peers. And it never ignores his obsession with theatrical lighting. One of the most exaggerated works here is a portrait of a fellow artist sitting by a fire, its flicker turning her into a bug-eyed cartoon. The last gallery astounds, even today, with its photo-based paintings from the late 1920s and 30s. Alexander Gavin Henderson, 2nd Lord Faringdon descends a staircase, all in white, like a bleached Luc Tuymans. Edward G Robinson and Joan Blondell leer out of the limelight of a gangster movie poster in an amazing work of proto pop. Most haunting of all is a portrait of Edward VIII emerging from a limousine in 1936. It shows Sickert as the most incisive – and premonitory – of history painters. The king’s legs are spindly, his sideways gaze shifty and he holds a busby to himself like an impotent shield. He is fading out already, eyes and face growing spectral in Sickert’s pale paint. Two months later, he will abdicate.

5/1/2022,"Spring is here, a fresh coat of paint splashed over the world, the sight of unfurling leaves and bright flowers giving many people an extra bounce in their step. Those longer days can bring a new challenge for anyone with little children, though: how to get them to sleep when the pesky sun is still beaming through the windows? Just in time come two new picture books exploring bedtime. First up, Clare Helen Walsh’s mini science lesson wrapped up in a beautifully cosy tale which finds Miki and her mother flying off into space to find out why it’s still light, even though Miki has brushed her teeth and put on her PJs. While they zip past stars and planets, Sunshine at Bedtime (Storyhouse) scoots through the basics of how the Earth orbits the sun and how that causes seasons. Illustrator Sally Soweol Han characterises the sun with fluttery eyelashes and a huge smile, blushing each page with a soft glow. It’s not light skies keeping the boy awake in Alex English’s Monkey Bedtime (Faber, 5 May), but a host of hairy primates who have escaped from the zoo. At first it’s just one pygmy marmoset tapping at the window, but before long the tiny chap has let in dozens of his pals and chaos erupts in the bathroom: “The tamarin burped out his name in bubbles in the air. The marmoset jumped in the sink, squeezed toothpaste in his hair.” With mum off dealing with the baby (while occasionally shouting to her son to get undressed, wash his face, GET READY!), the situation spirals out of control, depicted by Pauline Gregory’s lively drawings of monkeys wrecking the house (the shocked pet dog watching on is a nice touch). Soon the boy finds himself in tears which, fortunately, sparks a mass tidy-up by the guests who realise they’ve gone too far. An amusingly literal portrayal of the wildness that so often overcomes children at the end of the day, Monkey Bedtime demands to be read aloud. One Tiny Dot (Templar) by Lucy Rowland features a blue ball representing kindness in a story which rolls along with great energy and warmth, the ball growing as it witnesses thoughtfulness. Bursting with people, flowers and a predominantly pink, orange and yellow colour scheme, Gwen Millward’s vibrant illustrations have a slight 70s feel, and her blue dot recalls a famous child of that era, Roger Hargreaves’s Mr Happy (1971). But this is very much a book for our times in both style and message: when the blue dot is stopped in its tracks by a furious girl who is feeling left out, Anger and Kindness respond by hugging it out. “Well… the thing is with Anger (as Kindness well knew), if you look really hard, you’ll see Sadness there too.” One Tiny Dot invites little readers to think deeply about their emotions as a way to better understand themselves and others. Meanwhile, tensions are rising in Flooded (Quarto, 3 May). When their city starts to fill up with water, the animals initially try to get on with their lives – commuting to work, going for dinner – they just slip on their wellies, or the smaller animals pull out surfboards and canoes. But as the situation worsens, opinions start to diverge, until eventually the animals agree they must come together to solve the city’s problem. This impressive debut from new author-illustrator Mariajo Ilustrajo uses a minimal palette of smokey greys and inky blacks, the detailed drawings steadily becoming saturated in aquamarine as the flood waters grow. It’s a timely read and a brilliant reminder that although children’s books – and lives – are enriched by colour, sometimes less can be more.

5/1/2022,"The Home Office has placed immigration officers in child social services and dozens of other local authority departments, in an arrangement that has raised concerns about the ability of the most vulnerable to seek support, the Guardian can reveal. The officers are part of an “enhanced checking service” that includes providing information about people’s right to work and their eligibility for council services. The embedded official can also pass the details of undocumented people to immigration enforcement officers. These immigration officers have been placed in 25 local authorities, according to records obtained under freedom of information (FoI). They work across services dealing with vulnerable people including children, as well as homelessness, social care and mental health provision. Others using the arrangement since 2016 also include Transport for London and HS2. Several of the “customers” for this service are specifically child social care teams, but documents state that officers are expected to work across a range of local authority services. The on-site immigration fficer service was reported by the Observer in early 2019. The revelation that the Home Office was “hiring out” immigration officials to enforce the government’s hostile environment policy was met with outrage from critics, leading many local authorities to eject the officers, and the Home Office to remove information about the service from government websites. However, the service has continued to operate. Records released in response to FoI requests reveal that at the end of 2021, 12 local authorities plus HS2 and TfL still had immigration officers working within them on behalf of the Home Office, including five where officers had been placed specifically in children’s services. The shadow minister for immigration, Stephen Kinnock, said: “Keeping children safe is an absolute priority and there should be no action that puts that at risk. The Home Office must explain what exactly these officers are doing and how they can guarantee that their work does not deny vulnerable children the support or protection they need.” Mary Atkinson, campaigns officer at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: “It’s chilling to hear that government have been entrenching hostility into the services that families rely on for help and protection. Just like the hostile environment in healthcare, we know this practice spreads fear in our communities, and prevents people from seeking support. “It’s time government ended this dangerous and discriminatory approach – every resident should be able to put their trust in local councils at times of need.” Colin Yeo, an immigration law barrister at Garden Court Chambers, said: “Councils are not legally obliged to collaborate with the immigration authorities in this way and it is disappointing to see them voluntarily creating a hostile environment for vulnerable migrants. Enforced removals and voluntary returns are very rare now so all this does is force people underground who need help and support to get on their feet.” A template agreement between the Home Office and local authorities seen by the Guardian reveals the extent to which immigration officials work across council services. The document, marked “official sensitive”, states: “the officer will work the following teams within the customer’s organisation; housing needs; homelessness and immigration team; children’s services leaving care; adult social care; adult mental health services … the officer will conduct real-time immigration status checks to support the customer’s decision-making in relation to the individual’s or family’s eligibility for support or benefits and advise on the implications of those status checks.” The advice provided by the immigration officer includes providing information about people’s right to work and their eligibility for council services. Under the “no recourse to public funds” policy, people without the right to remain in the UK are denied access to a range of public services, such as housing. The officer is also there to advise on “voluntary returns”, whereby people return to their country of citizenship, according to the document. Local authorities that placed immigration officers in children’s services included Enfield, Sutton, Thurrock, Slough and Barnet. At the end of 2021, the 12 local authorities that still had immigration officers working with them on behalf of the Home Office were: Barking & Dagenham, Barnet, Bexley, Enfield, Essex, Greenwich, Hertfordshire, Hillingdon, Slough, Sutton, Thurrock, and Newham. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Local authorities can request dedicated support on immigration related matters, with advice on specific cases where appropriate, but this is voluntary and aims to help vulnerable migrants, particularly single mothers and families with small children, to resolve their status. It is usually used to help those who are destitute access appropriate support. “Individual decisions are made by local authorities rather than immigration staff and to suggest otherwise is wrong.”",News/UK news,"Immigration officers placed in 25 local authorities by Home Office, FoI reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/01/immigration-officers-local-authorities-home-office-foi-embedded
