4/6/2022,"Titus Low, one of Singapore’s most recognizable adult content creators, could potentially face a maximum of 21 months in jail for sharing sexually explicit content of himself online.

Low, a 22-year-old bisexual adult content creator, has been sharing images and videos of his ""private parts"" via his OnlyFans account since April 2021. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, Low claims he has not done anything wrong.

“Maybe if I had hurt someone, then I’d deserve to go to prison. But this feels unjustified,” he added.

The idea to start an OnlyFans account dawned on Low after a shirtless picture of him became a hit on Instagram. He joined OnlyFans a year ago, and by July 2021, he had already amassed over 2,000 fans who pay at least $15 a month to view his adult content.

Using his earnings from the content subscription service, Low reportedly enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle in his $6,600-a-month condo, having bought a Mercedes GT coupe and a labradoodle worth $6,500, among other purchases.

Low believed the OnlyFans setup could save him from any legal issues since the website is only accessible through subscription. However, the Singaporean Penal Code states that it is illegal to “transmit any obscene materials by electronic means, or to take part in or receive profits from any business where such materials are transmitted.”

“Technically speaking, [that means] it is against the law to send a nude photo of yourself, even if it is consensual,"" Mark Teng, an executive director at Singaporean law firm That.Legal, told BBC in January.

Problems began piling up in September 2021 when Singaporean authorities started building a case against Low after receiving a tip from an undisclosed source informing them about the content creator’s online activity.

The authorities reportedly raided his home, took his devices and seized his OnlyFans account in November 2021. They also ordered him to stay off the website, but Low disobeyed them and reset the password of his account using his spare smartphone.

Low was arrested on Dec. 30, 2021, and charged with two counts of transmitting obscene material via electronic means. According to reports, he was also charged under the Criminal Procedure Code after resisting the police order not to log on to his OnlyFans account. The content creator was granted a bail worth 5,000 Singaporean dollars (approximately $3,680) under the condition that he stay away from OnlyFans and avoid communicating with any of the prosecution witnesses.

After receiving two new charges in February, Low currently faces five charges in total.

Low has turned his focus to other online platforms and ventures, such as selling his own NFTs and sex toys modeled after his genitals. He told the Times that he is prepared to move out of Singapore to restart his OnlyFans career and expressed interest in London and Los Angeles.

However, the content creator must remain in Singapore for now and consider the possibility of prison. Enjoy this content? Read more from NextShark!

4/6/2022,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin defended U.S. military efforts related to Ukraine and the strength of the military in general during a fiery exchange with Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Tuesday. At a wide-ranging House Armed Services Committee hearing, Gaetz pressed Austin about a lecture on democratic socialism at the National Defense University that became a target for conservative media, accusing Pentagon officials of misplacing their focus. ""You guys said that Russia would overrun Ukraine in 36 days,"" Gaetz said. ""You said that the Taliban would be kept at bay for months. You totally blew those calls, and maybe we would be better at them if the National Defense University actually worked a little more on strategy and a little less on woke-ism."" Read Next: With Hour-Long Drives and Weeks Until Appointments, Pregnant Military Women Feel Pain of Medical Reforms A fired-up Austin shot back: ""Has it occurred to you Russia has not overrun Ukraine because of what we've done and what our allies have done? Have you ever even thought about that?"" Since the start of the Biden administration, conservatives have been accusing Pentagon leadership of being more focused on so-called ""woke"" ideas such as diversity, equity and inclusion than on combat effectiveness. Similar GOP criticism during last year's House Armed Service Committee hearing with Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley prompted an impassioned response from Milley. This year's hearing took place amid the backdrop of the five-week-old war in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces have so far failed to achieve any major goals in the face of what U.S. officials have described as disastrous logistics and stronger-than-expected Ukrainian resistance. American defense officials have acknowledged that there could have been an intelligence gap that led the U.S. to overestimate Russia and underestimate Ukraine before the invasion. Republicans have also accused the Biden administration of failing to deter the invasion by, among other things, not shipping enough weapons to Ukraine early enough. In other exchanges at Tuesday's hearing, both Austin and Milley said they doubted that anything besides sending U.S. forces directly into Ukraine could have deterred Putin from what Milley described as a ""long-standing"" goal of invading. Milley added that he ""certainly wouldn't have advised"" deploying U.S. troops to Ukraine. But it was the exchange with Gaetz that stoked the ire of the typically mild-mannered Austin. Gaetz's early questioning, in which he did not let Austin rebut his allegations that the National Defense University was teaching socialism, prompted a warning from committee Chairman Adam Smith, D-Wash., that ""we're not going to let the guy say four words and still talk and then cut him off."" But the exchange with Austin devolved into a shouting match shortly after that, when Gaetz contended that the military has fallen behind in the development of hypersonic weapons, which are also being pursued by adversaries such as Russia. ""What do you mean we're behind in hypersonics,"" Austin interjected. After some back-and-forth on hypersonic weapons, Gaetz held that ""it's not just the hypersonics."" ""It's all over the world,"" he continued, citing increased Chinese military flights near Taiwan and North Korean missile tests. Austin defended the U.S. military as the ""most capable, most combat-credible force in the world"" and accused Gaetz of being ""embarrassed"" by his country. ""I'm embarrassed by your leadership,"" Gaetz shot back. ""It seems the Biden administration is trying to destroy our military by force-feeding it woke-ism."" Several Democrats later used part of their time to defend Austin and implicitly criticize Gaetz. Given the opportunity by Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., to further rebut the GOP's use of ""contrived boogeymans,"" Austin maintained that he and the military are focused entirely on defending the country. ""So any notion that they're woke or that our military is woke, I take issue with that,"" Austin said. ""Because it's just not true. It's a false narrative, and they deserve better than that."" When he concluded the hearing, Smith, without mentioning Gaetz by name, apologized for ""one notable exception"" to an otherwise ""very, very good discussion."" ""I looked it up. Sadly, I don't have the power to simply take a member's time away,"" Smith said. -- Rebecca Kheel can be reached at rebecca.kheel@military.com. Follow her on Twitter @reporterkheel.

 Shaquille O'Neal told GQ he revamped his diet after he realized he had gained belly fat. O'Neal said he reduced his daily carb and fat intake and now eats more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. O'Neal said his new diet and training routine has helped him lose weight and stay healthy. In a recent interview with GQ, Shaquille O'Neal said he revamped his diet and started using the elliptical after he realized his belly fat had ballooned over his pants. ""I was waking up and going to work, chilling, eating whatever. I wasn't paying attention. I looked down one day, I was like, 'Damn,' My belly was way over my belt,"" he told the outlet. O'Neal joked that he had, ""Charles Barkley Over The Belt Syndrome"" referencing the physique of his former NBA rival and his current ""Inside the NBA on TNT"" co-host. The 50-year-old Hall of Famer previously told Men's Journal he lost 30 lbs at the start of 2021 after his doctor asked him if he wanted to die during a check-up. ""When they hit you with that three-letter word that starts with D and ends with E, it changes stuff up,"" O'Neal told GQ. O'Neal said he started a strict new diet and fitness routine to help him lose weight and stay healthy after 50. He said he uses the elliptical and cut down on fat and carbs while increasing his daily intake of fruit, vegetables, and lean protein. O'Neal said he includes fruit in the first three meals of his day. For breakfast, he eats fruit, and then three turkey sausages and about four or five egg whites. The retired NBA star said his second meal is just fruit, followed up by more fruit and a shake or smoothie for his third meal. He previously told Men's Health that his smoothie recipe is made up of blueberries, bananas, and peanut butter. His recipe is similar to Tom Brady's favorite smoothie recipe, but Brady uses almond butter instead of peanut butter and includes whey protein and walnuts for a total of 34 grams of protein. The four-time NBA Champion told GQ his fourth meal is just a salad, and his fifth meal is only lean chicken, fish, or steak. O'Neal previously told Men's Health that his go-to fish of choice is salmon, which is now his favorite dinner meal overall. While O'Neal said he cut back on fats, carbs, and included more fruit in his diet to lose weight, experts say about 25-30% of a person's daily diet should be made up of fruit, according to WebMD. Carbs are also great fuel for quick energy for workouts, and healthy fats, like olive oil, are a key part of a heart-healthy diet and have anti-inflammatory benefits and antioxidants.

4/6/2022,"Global reaction Monday to what appears to be deliberate killings of civilians in Ukraine in areas north of Kyiv, the capital, where Russian soldiers have either retreated or been pushed back: ___ ""Hundreds of people killed. Tortured, executed civilians. Bodies on the streets. Boobytrapped area. Even the bodies of the dead are boobytrapped. Widespread aftermath of looting. Concentrated evil has visited our land. The killers, executioners, rapists, marauders who call themselves an army ... The world has already seen many war crimes. At different times. On different continents. But it is time to do everything so that the war crimes of the Russian military become the last manifestation of such evil on earth.” — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a video address. ___ “The bloody massacres committed by the Russians, by the Russian soldiers, deserve to be called by their name. It is genocide and this crime must be tried as the crime of genocide ... When we look at the terrible crimes against women, children and entire families, our scream should be even louder. Bucha, Irpin, Hostomel, Motyzhyn: (these) are the names of the places that each of us will probably remember for the rest of our lives. The Russians committed the crime of genocide.” — Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. ___ “This information should be seriously doubted. From what we have seen, the video material can’t be trusted, as our specialists from the Defense Ministry detected signs of video forgery and various fakes. The facts, the chronology of events also doesn’t speak in favor of the credibility of these claims ... We would require many world leaders not to rush with statements, groundless accusations.” — Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ “You may remember I got criticized for calling Putin a war criminal. Well, the truth of the matter is we saw what happened in Bucha. This warrants him ... he is a war criminal. ... We have to continue to provide Ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight. And we have to gather all the detail, so this can be an actual, have a war crimes trial. This guy is brutal. And what’s happening in Bucha is outrageous.” — U.S. President Joe Biden talking to reporters. ___ “We are all extremely shocked and we have condemned it with the utmost strength. Secondly, it is clear that there is clear evidence of war crimes. It was the Russian army that was in Bucha. We have told Ukrainian authorities that we were at their disposal to help with the investigation they’re carrying out. International justice must prevail. Those who committed these crimes will have to answer for them ... What just happened in Bucha calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures"" — French President Emmanuel Macron on France-Inter. ___ “The reports of Ukrainian civilians who have been killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops is beyond reprehensible. Russia must answer to the world for what they’ve done.” — New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. ___ “I hope that everything possible can be done so that those behind these war crimes don’t go unpunished, and that they can appear before the courts, in this case the International Criminal Court, to answer these alleged cases of crimes against humanity, war crimes and, why not say it, of genocide, too.” — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez at the “Wake Up, Spain” forum. —- “The atrocities committed by the Russian army in Ukraine are horrific, they are disgraceful and they are shameful. The reality is that the images from Bucha and Irpin are the same as other reports from other cities in Ukraine. They underlined the level of threat facing Ukraine and the global rules-based world order. In Kiev, I was clear. These are war crimes that are perpetrated by war criminals, and these coordinated acts of inhumanity cannot remain unanswered and that we will hold all those responsible to account.” European Union Parliament President Roberta Metsola. ___ “Please, I am begging you, do something! ... It’s me talking, a Ukrainian woman, a mother of two kids and one grandchild. For all the wives and mothers, make peace on Earth so no one ever grieves again. No one, neither Ukrainian, nor Russian, no one on the whole Earth. I want to live, everyone just wants to live.” — Tanya Nedashkivs’ka, 57, whose husband was killed by Russian troops on Monday, urging Ukraine and Russia to reach a peace agreement. She said her husband was detained by Russian troops in her neighborhood and that she found her husband's body and two others in a stairwell leading to the basement of a nearby building. ___ “I came closer and saw that his body was burnt. ... They didn’t just shoot him, they also used that weapon (a flame thrower) which sends out fire. They burnt him down.” — Volodymyr Pilhutskyi, describing seeing the body of his neighbor, Pavlo Vlasenko, after Russian soldiers went to Vlasenko's home and took him away. Pavlo Vlasenko, and his wife, Natalya, are now buried in a makeshift grave in Bucha. ___ “This is scary, this is genocide, this is fascism. This is the extermination of people, innocent people, children, women and the elderly.” — Olena Kolesnik, a refugee from Kharkiv, Ukraine. ___ “I was strongly shocked that a brutal act of violence was conducted on civilians in the outskirts of Kyiv. Murdering innocent civilians is a violation of international humanitarian law and it’s absolutely unacceptable.” — Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi at a government briefing. ___ Follow all AP stories on the Russian invasion of Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine.",World/Associated Press,"'Tortured, executed civilians': Reaction to Ukraine war dead",https://news.yahoo.com/tortured-executed-civilians-reaction-ukraine-145143158.html
