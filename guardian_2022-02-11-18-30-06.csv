2/11/2022,"Gordon Brown has urged rich countries to consider “extraordinary measures” similar to those taken during the global financial crisis to increase developing nations’ access to Covid vaccines, calling on governments to fill a $16bn (£11.8bn) funding gap within weeks. The former British prime minister, who hosted the 2009 G20 summit credited with having staved off a second Great Depression and as chancellor helped unveil a landmark debt relief package at the 2005 G8 summit in Gleneagles, said a similar act of international coordination was urgently required on Covid.  “Just as in the way we had to deal with debt relief and then deal with the global financial crisis by taking extraordinary measures to try to overcome these challenges we have to do this even now,” he said. Speaking on the Equals podcast hosted by Oxfam on Friday, Brown said the leaders of wealthy countries had weeks to commit to filling a $16bn funding gap announced by the World Health Organization this week for its plan to accelerate equitable access to Covid vaccines and tests. “Unless the money comes in urgently, we will not be able to fund the next stages of vaccines, treatments, testing, and even the medical oxygen and PPE needed by nurses and doctors [around the world],” he said. Noting that countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo had vaccinated fewer than 1% of their populations, Brown reiterated his calls for a vaccine patent waiver and technology transfer. “What’s happened in Africa is as bad as what happened under colonial rule,” he said. “Africa has been deprived of vaccines but also of the ability to manufacture its own vaccines because it does not have the patents to do so.” He added: “The scale of this inequality is so great that I’m not sure the world will ever forgive us for failing to deliver the equity in vaccine distribution that should be possible.”",News/Global development,Gordon Brown calls for ‘extraordinary measures’ to tackle Covid inequalities,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/11/gordon-brown-calls-for-extraordinary-measures-to-tackle-covid-inequalities
2/11/2022,"Midway through Odell Beckham Jr’s 50-minute virtual news conference on Monday, amid the usual battery of pre-Super Bowl questions, a disembodied voice chimed in that the 29-year-old Los Angeles Rams receiver initially struggled to place. “I ain’t got no questions, man. But I just wanna start by sayin’, dawg, you’re deserving of this moment,” said the voice, ultimately revealed as that of Jarvis Landry – Beckham’s teammate in Cleveland and at LSU. “You put countless hours to get where you are today. I witnessed it all first-hand. You have scars to show for where you are today. This is a dream that you are actually turning into reality.” Beckham, playing against type, absorbed the adulation with a bashful smile.  There are usually hard-and-fast rules against media members, even extraordinarily part-time ‘reporters’ like Landry, cheering on the players they follow. But, really, it’s hard not to break out the pom-poms for Beckham, the (nearly) 6ft blond branded as the embodiment of diva NFL receivers from the moment he was selected 12th in the 2014 draft. Today in sports history November 23rd, 2014. Odell Beckham Jr had is famous catch 👀 pic.twitter.com/0c3ou8IpWT But since his famous touchdown grab in his rookie season – a highlight that not only came on a primetime stage (NBC’s Sunday Night Football) against a big-name opponent (Dallas), but also gave receivers of all levels permission to try one-handed catches in games – Beckham went from nuclear-grade NFL weapon to global rock star, as apt to inspire young Black boys to bleach their locks as drive Lena Dunham’s Met Gala sex fantasies. In other words, Beckham was a perfect fit for New York, a Giant in the mould of Frank Gifford, a bona fide A-lister who hobnobs with the in-crowd when he’s not revolutionising NFL offence. On the list of players with at least 6,800 yards and 50 touchdown catches through their first 80 games there is only one name: Beckham. But then just as quickly as Beckham was toasted as Prince of New York, he was taken down several pegs and dismissed as a bellyacher when his chemistry with an ageing Eli Manning declined with the quarterback’s arm strength and some uninspired play-calling in the wake of head coach Tom Coughlin’s departure. With the Giants continuing to struggle in 2019, Beckham and his $95m contract were shipped to Cleveland, where he was reunited with Landry. Together, they looked poised to reverse the Browns’ fortunes and set offensive records with No1 overall pick Baker Mayfield pulling the trigger. They might well have if Beckham had stayed healthy. In the moments Beckham did run patterns for Mayfield & Co, he looked so out of sync – to the point of leaving seasoned observers wondering whether Beckham was still a good receiver, let alone the league’s finest. That Mayfield seemed to flourish whenever Beckham missed time only fueled the idea that he was cooked. His father was quick to push back on that narrative, however; in November, Odell Beckham Sr posted an 11-minute Instagram supercut of Mayfield either not looking in his son’s direction or missing him entirely. “Generally Behind Da Scene,” Beckham Sr wrote. “BUT NOT TODAY.” The video’s release, three days before the trade deadline, all but sealed Beckham’s fate in Cleveland. But instead of getting something for him in return, the Browns simply cut him, which gives some sense of the depths to which the league’s regard for Beckham had plummeted. After clearing waivers Beckham signed a deal with LA for only the balance of the 2021 season. He had considered other teams – the Patriots, his hometown Saints, Aaron Rodgers’s Packers. But ultimately, it was a pitch from pass rusher Von Miller that won over Beckham. Whereas in Cleveland, he was a lone star (go ahead, @-me Mayfield stans), in LA Beckham is one in a constellation that includes telegenic GM Les Snead and NFL ‘It’ coach Sean McVay. Like LeBron’s Lakers, but with more success this season, they’ve assembled their own win-now super team, mortgaging their future to acquire quarterback Matthew Stafford, running back Sony Michel and cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Beckham had one job: to fill in for the injured Robert Woods. Which is to say, he would play a secondary role to Cooper Kupp – who this season made a compelling case to become the league’s first wide receiver MVP before Rodgers took the title. Despite little time to get up to speed Beckham has proven to be an indispensable part of the Rams’ Super Bowl run, catching more touchdowns in his brief time in LA than in any of his seasons in Cleveland. By all accounts he’s been an ideal Rams teammate as well, news that clashes with calcified notions of Beckham as an insufferable spotlight-chaser. After contributing 11 catches for 113 yards in the NFC title clincher against San Francisco, Beckham spread his arms and ran around the field like a caged bird, free at last. “This was about heart,” he told CBS Sports’ Josina Anderson in the glow of the come-from-behind victory. “This was about putting your foot down and saying, No more. We gotta finish the job, but this is a helluva moment.” Certainly, no one will be overlooking Beckham on Sunday against Cincinnati. Only a curmudgeon – or a Browns fan, perhaps – would be hard pressed not to root on his redemption.

The language in which he performs and his cultural ancestry is Ainu; both have been suppressed through the centuries by the Japanese. Oki’s instrument is Ainu, too: a five-stringed ancient harp, the tonkori, with a bewitchingly woody, stark, hollow sound. After working in New York in the 1980s, Oki returned to his home island of Hokkaido to plait together threads of Ainu music with international influences like throat singing, dub and African drumming.

2/11/2022,"Heathrow airport has said more than 1.3 million passengers cancelled their travel plans over the Christmas and new year period because of Omicron, with hopes for a summer recovery after a weak start to the year. The airport said travel was down 56% in January compared with 2019 levels, a worse start to the year than it had forecast, as the hangover from the Omicron variant affected traveller confidence.  “After a tough Christmas, Omicron has continued to bite, and this has been a weak start to the year,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport. “As short-lived as the additional travel restrictions were, they ruined the travel plans of more than 1.3 million passengers in the last two months.” He added that the removal of government restrictions that mean vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK no longer have to take coronavirus tests, which started from 4am on Friday, offered a “ray of hope” for the recovery of the travel industry. Despite the weaker than expected start, the airport is maintaining its forecast of 45 million passengers this year, just over half of pre-pandemic levels, as it banks on a bumper summer of Britons holidaying abroad. “We are working with airlines and ground handlers to increase resources across the airport ahead of the summer peak,” the airport said. “While bookings for outbound tourism are recovering, inbound tourism and business travel remain weak due to Covid-19 levels in the UK and other countries, international testing requirements and the risk of new border closures in the event of a new variant of concern.” Only 19.4 million passengers passed through the airport in 2021 – less than a quarter of 2019 levels and below even 2020, the year the coronavirus was declared a pandemic. “Today’s removal of restrictions for vaccinated passengers in and out of the UK offers a ray of hope,” Holland-Kaye said. “But the Omicron hangover proves demand remains fragile, and at risk to new variants of concern, and government needs to set out a playbook for managing future variants that allows travel and trade to keep flowing.”",News/UK news,Heathrow hopeful of summer holiday boom after January passenger slump,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/heathrow-hopeful-of-summer-holiday-boom-after-january-passenger-slump-omicron
2/11/2022,"The mayor of London’s statement on the resignation of Cressida Dick made it clear: a toxic culture within the police, including a persistent seam of misogyny, played a big role in the Metropolitan police commissioner’s downfall. It is remarkable that the outrage that consumed the force after the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer Wayne Couzens in March last year, was only one scandal among many to have shaken women’s faith that the service was there to protect them.  While Dick had little control over the events that engulfed her, she led a series of missteps that further eroded confidence in her leadership, particularly among women. In the days that followed Everard’s death the Met was criticised for banning a peaceful vigil in her honour, and when a vigil went ahead without their blessing, the image of a woman being held down by officers was beamed across television screens. “A rotten culture stems from rotten leadership – so it’s good news that she has finally resigned,” said Anna Birley, of Reclaim These Streets who organised the original vigil. Many who worked with Dick praised her work ethic and intelligence, but she never seemed to fully acknowledge the scale of misogyny that critics insisted ran through her force. In June, on the day that one of her officers pleaded guilty to the kidnapping and rape of Everard, Dick badly missed the mark in a speech to the Women’s Institute, causing anger by seeming to minimise the problem, saying the force had the occasional “bad ’un” within its ranks. In December, she had to apologise again when two Met officers were jailed after taking pictures of two sisters, Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, found stabbed to death in June 2020. Their mother, Mina Smallman, who said racism was a factor in the Met’s initial bungling of the search for her daughters, described the officers actions as a betrayal of “catastrophic proportion”. “Those police officers felt so safe, so untouchable, that they felt they would take photographs with our murdered daughters,” she said. And then, as a new year started, Dick’s leadership was struck by another blow. A fiercely critical report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) unveiled shocking details of officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. “You ever slapped your missus? It makes them love you more,” wrote one. “They are biologically programmed to like that shit.” The Met’s response? “We do not believe there is a culture of misogyny in the Met.” The IOPC disagreed, saying: “We believe these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’.” Dick was the first female and first openly homosexual officer to lead the country’s biggest force, but Khan made it clear that he had no confidence she would be the person to “root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exist” in the Met. Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “The problem with Cressida as the first female to rise to the top of the most difficult job in policing, is that in order to do so she had to put loyalty to her officers above all else.” She added that after “mounting evidence of a police service littered with appalling misconduct”, there were too many officers accused of violence and abuse still in their jobs and of whistleblowers victimised instead of listened too. “Cressida Dick’s response to these series of stories has been wholly inadequate.” So, what now? An independent review of culture and standards in the Met by Lady Louise Casey, will focus on the force’s vetting, recruitment and training procedures. At the same time an independent inquiry chaired by Dame Elish Angiolini QC will look at Couzens’ actions during his career, and whether any red flags were missed or allegations made against him mishandled. Whoever takes on this role at a tumultuous time for the Met will know that more apologies are likely to be needed. Ruth Davison, the CEO of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, said on Thursday: “One resignation at the top doesn’t mean the police have solved their misogyny problem.”",News/UK news,Misogyny in Met played key role in downfall of Cressida Dick,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/misogyny-in-met-police-played-key-role-in-downfall-of-cressida-dick
2/11/2022,"There were five Liberal MPs who crossed the floor to protect LGBTQ+ students against discrimination but the one who tipped the balance is now being accused of breaching a commitment not to defeat the government. It was the member for Reid, Fiona Martin, who most shocked her colleagues when she crossed the floor shortly before dawn on Thursday to add protections that would result in the entire religious discrimination bill being shelved.  The rebel group of five MPs was built on the foundation of Bridget Archer and Trent Zimmerman, who had publicly warned they could not back the bill unamended, but Martin was the decisive third vote that guaranteed the amendment’s success. Dave Sharma honoured his commitment that he would not be the casting vote, but if the dam wall broke and the government lost a third MP, he would be the fourth to cross. Katie Allen’s vote was tied to Sharma’s on the understanding the Liberals could use a rebellious streak to try and hold their under threat blue-ribbon seats of Higgins and Wentworth. On Friday the defence minister, Peter Dutton, said that Scott Morrison was “frankly misled” about how unnamed MPs would vote on amendments during the religious discrimination bill debate. The crucial vote on Thursday forced the government to shelve its religious discrimination bill, as conservatives within the Coalition and Christian lobby groups argued the LGBTQ+ student amendment to the Sex Discrimination Act (SDA) would prevent schools setting their own ethos. Martin, a psychologist for 20 years, had expressed her concerns in the Coalition party room. Martin tipped her hand in a vote at 4.24am, joining Zimmerman and Archer in indicating that she wanted to remove a religious exemption to the SDA. Although Allen and Sharma voted with the government in that division, in the next vote at 4.32am they joined Labor, the crossbench, Martin, Zimmerman and Archer to enact a narrower amendment. Morrison allowed the votes to go ahead because he believed despite their concerns about LGBTQ+ students most Liberal moderates would vote down the amendment in return for improvements in the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) review process and the creation of a new select committee on children’s mental health. When Morrison spoke shortly before 2am on Thursday he announced the review would report six months after the religious bill passed, down from 12, and the creation of the new committee to be chaired by Allen and supported by Martin due to their “great clinical experience”. Liberal MP Warren Entsch told Guardian Australia that he had requested the shorter ALRC review timeframe, and a broadening of its terms of reference to include school staff and other forms of discrimination against LGBTQ+ students. “I was able to read the party room and it was clear to me there was no way I was going to change the minds of the large majority who wanted to pass the religious discrimination bill,” Entsch said. Entsch said it was “no accident but a lot of bloody hard work” on his part to force the government to improve the bill by removing the Folau and conscientious objection clauses. On Wednesday evening, Entsch told parliament he would vote for the bill to “bank the successes” of these changes. But for others the momentum was swinging back the other way. A group of four moderate MPs led by Angie Bell had negotiated for the religious exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act to be removed, only to see Morrison water it down to a commitment only to ban expulsion on the grounds of sexuality, omitting protection on the grounds of gender identity. Labor’s decision on Wednesday to release a letter showing on 1 December Morrison had committed to Anthony Albanese to prevent “any form of discrimination against a student on the basis of sexuality or gender identity” further fuelled momentum to cross the floor. Later that evening, Morrison, Josh Frydenberg and senior moderates Simon Birmingham and Tim Wilson met MPs with concerns about the bill including Entsch, Martin and Sharma. Allen was absent. Senior Liberal sources say Martin committed not to cross the floor before the meeting. Entsch told Guardian Australia he was “very disappointed in the actions” of MPs he chose not to name who crossed the floor without telling the government. “With the exception of Katie [Allen], I was in the room when they made their commitments,” Entsch said. “We all came out of that room, with very, very clear positions on what we were going to do. There was no ambiguity whatsoever.” Entsch’s account is disputed. According to one alternative account, Martin didn’t speak at the meeting, which concluded when Morrison believed the bill would have to be pulled because Allen was not yet on board. Leaders of the government allowed the bill and amendments to go to a vote because they believed they later secured Allen’s vote, but Labor and the government were shocked to see Martin cross the floor, triggering Sharma and Allen to follow. Entsch took aim at MPs on all sides – Labor, the crossbench and his own party – for “political opportunism” and voting “on the spur of the moment and not thinking about the consequences”. Entsch praised Zimmerman and Archer, who he said voted with “the most noble of reasons” and whose integrity “remains 100% intact”. Martin responded to Guardian Australia: “I protected the human rights of our most vulnerable in our parliament. I did what was right. I supported the religious discrimination bill, I supported people of faith and I protected the rights of vulnerable young students. To me, that was the right balance.” Sharma said “my conscience is clear”. On Friday Dutton denied that Morrison’s authority had been eroded by the incident, telling ABC radio the prime minister “was frankly misled”. “There are undertakings that were given. The undertaking wasn’t honoured,” Dutton said. He declined to give details of “private conversations” but noted “the government doesn’t go into a vote like that unless there’s been assurances given”. Dutton appeared to confirm that the government was aware that if the dam broke with a third MP joining Zimmerman and Archer to pass the amendment, that others would follow. “I think in certain circumstances if one goes, then you lose five, and [if] you lose a vote by one, you can lose it by five – it’s the same outcome,” he said. Dutton said the government had “very clear statements from a number of people, including beyond the five” and that was the basis for Morrison allowing the bill to a vote. “The prime minister based his judgement, his actions, his decisions on a perfectly reasonable basis following discussions, and it’s difficult when you get to the floor of the parliament and those undertakings aren’t honoured.” Guardian Australia contacted Allen for comment.",News/Australia news,‘I did what was right’: Liberal rebel Fiona Martin on the change that sunk the religious discrimination bill ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/11/i-did-what-was-right-liberal-rebel-fiona-martin-on-the-change-that-sunk-the-religious-discrimination-bill
2/11/2022,"Perth festival is facing calls on its opening night to drop the orchestral production Become Ocean from this year’s program over a sponsorship arrangement with fossil fuel company Woodside Energy. The production, scheduled for Saturday, is a performance of John Luther Adams’ Pulitzer prize-winning work – originally written as a reflection about oceanic changes brought on by global heating – by the Western Australian Youth Orchestra (WAYO) and the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO), in a partnership between the orchestras sponsored by Woodside.  Fossil Free Arts WA have called for the production to be dropped from the festival lineup over concerns that Woodside’s sponsorship amounts to “arts-washing”. Steven Alyian and Madeleine Antoine, both members of Selfless Orchestra and spokespeople for Fossil Free Arts, said they wanted Perth festival to “take a stand” where WAYO and WASO had not. “As Australian artists and musicians, a lot of us want to see the end of greenwashing and the exploitation of artists for corporate interests,” Alyian said. “This is quite a blatant attempt at arts-washing.” Antoine said that as an important training ground for future generations of musicians, WAYO had an obligation to find alternative sponsorship arrangements. Greenpeace chief executive, David Ritter, said the organisation wanted the sponsorship arrangement with Woodside to end as it was “damaging the festival’s reputation by cynically sponsoring, of all things, an event celebrating the ocean”. “Gas is a fossil fuel that is driving dangerous climate change, which is the greatest threat to our oceans – so for Woodside to be sponsoring this event is grotesque corporate hypocrisy,” Ritter said. In a piece for the Guardian in 2018, Adams, the piece’s composer, wrote about the inspiration behind Become Ocean. “As the polar ice melts and sea levels rise, we humans find ourselves facing the prospect that once again we may literally become ocean … There is no time to waste. I want my art to matter in the deepest possible way.” Amber Fresh, a member of Perth band Rabbit Island, is playing the festival’s Aesoteric event on 25 February. She also called for WASO to drop Woodside as sponsor. “If these companies give up fossil fuels, I’ll be happy to take their money. With pleasure,” Fresh said. “I want to be writing love songs, not worrying whether the kids who come after me will have fresh water.” “[Fossil fuel companies] shouldn’t be asked ‘to sponsor’ and they shouldn’t offer. Linking yourself with beautiful things like the arts is a way to pretend what’s happening is not outrageous.” It is understood the sponsorship arrangement with Woodside was arranged by the West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO). Fossil Free Arts WA had attempted to meet with WASO about the arrangement, but said their approach was refused. Woodside is currently working to develop the $16bn Scarborough gas project off WA’s coast that has been described as a “bet against” efforts to control the worst effects of climate change. The burning of fossil fuels such as gas are a key driver of global heating. Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021. WAYO was contacted for comment but did not respond by deadline. WASO said it “will not be providing comment at this time”. Woodside sponsors a large number of arts and sporting organisations, some of which have also faced opposition, such as Surf Life Saving WA’s Nippers program. The company has been a longtime WASO sponsor, with Woodside’s chief executive, Meg O’Neill also serving on the orchestra’s board. Woodside has also been the “principal partner” of the Western Australian Youth Orchestra since 1991, with naming rights to some of its programs. The orchestra has regularly played Woodside events, including the company’s annual general meetings. A spokesperson for Woodside said its 2021 partnership deal had “connected WAYO with the [WASO]” and was “helping develop our local talent, creating pathways for the next generation of gifted musicians”. “Through the partnership, WAYO musicians are provided with unique opportunities to learn from Western Australia’s professional state orchestra,” they said. Perth festival itself receives considerable funding from fossil fuel companies. An ongoing arrangement with US oil giant Chevron is among several that have drawn controversy in recent years. Nathan Bennett, Perth festival executive director, said its corporate sponsors “allow us to bring meaningful cultural experiences to hundreds of thousands of people in Western Australia” and bring in acts that “otherwise would not happen”. “Become Ocean is a major work involving two orchestras at the heart of our musical culture in WA. Perth festival is proud to showcase and support local companies in our 2022 program,” Bennett said. “We receive support from a wide range of partners – including corporate sponsors, government supporters and philanthropists – that represent the scope of the Western Australian business sector.” Lucy Manne, CEO of 350.org, described Woodside’s sponsorship of Become Ocean as “farcical” as it was “very similar to what we have seen with cigarette companies and big tobacco”. “When you have a business model based on causing harm, you spend a lot of time and effort to improve your image,” Manne said. “It’s completely farcical for an arts event about the ocean to be sponsored by Woodside, as it is a company that is damaging marine environments and fuelling dangerous climate change.” According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the burning of fossil fuels by humanity contributes to warming oceans, acidification, oxygen depletion and the frequency of marine heatwaves. Manne said arts organisations should be free to refuse fossil fuel sponsorship and follow the example of organisations like the Australian Open, which appeared to have abandoned a multi-year partnership with Santos last year. Though Perth’s fringe arts festival Fringe World appeared to have divested itself from Woodside last year, it instead transitioned the sponsorship to its parent company, Artrage. Woodside is also a sponsor of Perth theatre companies Barking Gecko and Yirra Yaakin. Arts companies elsewhere have been divesting themselves of fossil fuel sponsorship, including the Royal Shakespeare Company and Edinburgh festival, which ended a 34-year relationship with BP in 2016.",Arts/Culture,Perth festival production of climate change work criticised for ‘farcical’ fossil fuel sponsorship,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/11/perth-festival-production-of-climate-change-work-criticised-for-farcical-fossil-fuel-sponsorship
