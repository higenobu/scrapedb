5/15/2022,"Moscow is preparing to hold a referendum in Mariupol on whether the city will join Russia, Ukrainian officials have claimed, following the announcement of a similar poll in Georgia’s breakaway region of South Ossetia. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the port city’s mayor, who is operating in exile, said sources among those remaining among its ruins believed a vote on its future was in the making, even as residents were going without food and water. The ruins left of Mariupol, a sea resort once home to 400,000 people, are largely occupied by Russia, although as many as 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers are holding out in the sprawling Azovstal steelworks by the port in the face of remorseless shelling. Andryushchenko told the Observer that an announcement of a referendum could come as early as Sunday, although he said there was no evidence yet of polling stations being established. He said on Saturday: “We have some information that the Russian authorities are preparing a referendum and could even call it tomorrow, but we don’t know yet if this is the case. But we see lots of integration of Mariupol into the Russian system, the education system, the banking system.” South Ossetia leader Anatoly Bibilov had announced on Friday he would hold a referendum on joining Russia on 17 July, claiming “we are coming home” and citing his people’s “historic aspiration” to join Russia. Moscow’s initial plan to seize the whole of Ukraine failed after they lost the bloody battle of Kyiv. The Kremlin has since focused on securing a swathe of land around the east and south-east of the country. The development came as Ukrainian officials were able to claim some major military successes, with the mayor of Kharkiv saying that Russian forces had now withdrawn “far out” from Ukraine’s second biggest city. The general staff of Ukraine’s army echoed the comments, reporting the Russians had left their positions around the north-eastern city, which is 31 miles (50km) from the Russian border. The remorseless shelling endured by the civilian population in the region had also paused, according to the regional governor, Oleh Sinegubov, while Ukrainian forces were launching a counteroffensive near the city of Izyum, 78 miles south of Kharkiv. But Putin’s forces have captured territory in the Donbas region, including Rubizhne, a city with a prewar population of around 55,000, and the situation appears increasingly grave for the remaining soldiers trapped in the Azovstal steelworks. Speaking on at a press conference in Kyiv, Natalia Zarytska, the wife of Bogdan Sements, who is among those trapped in the steelworks, called on China to intervene and help liberate the remaining people. She said: “Strong leaders cannot stand aside when there is evil. After all these negotiations, there is one person worldwide who it would be difficult for Vladimir Putin to refuse. We hope that strong and good China can make difficult decisions for the good. “We ask the esteemed premier of China, Xi Jinping, to express love and care for global values and eastern wisdom and to join the process of rescuing the defenders of Mariupol.” Hanna Ivleieva, a military service person and wife of a soldier in Mariupol, said only those who had lost their arms or legs were not fighting among the Ukrainian forces left in the city. She said: “I am a soldier with the Marines. My husband, my commanding officers, and close friends are now in Azovstal. “They were the first to engage in the battle in this war. We are proud of all Azovstal defenders, as they are stronger than the steel used to be produced here. “But we do not want them to be killed there. We need our heroes alive. We ask the President of China as Putin’s economic partner to undertake all the necessary procedures and rescue our guys”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said talks with Moscow on extracting a “large number” of wounded defenders and some medics out of the steelworks in return for the release of Russian prisoners of war were “very complex”, adding that Kyiv was using influential intermediaries. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, told local TV on Saturday that efforts were now focused on evacuating about 60 people. Ibrahim Kalin, a senior foreign policy adviser to Turkey’s president Recep Erdoğan, said on Saturday that the Turkish government had proposed to Moscow a sea evacuation of the wounded soldiers. As the war grinds on, foreign ministers from the world’s seven richest countries, the G7, warned at the end of a three-day meeting in Germany that millions of people will starve to death unless Russia allows the export of Ukrainian grain from blockaded ports. The G7 governments said Putin was pushing 43 million people towards famine by refusing to allow cereals to leave Ukraine via Black Sea ports. “Russia’s unprovoked and pre-meditated war of aggression has exacerbated the global economic outlook with sharply rising food, fuel and energy prices,” they said in a joint statement. “Combined with Russia blocking the exit routes for Ukraine’s grain, the world is now facing a worsening state of food insecurity and malnutrition ... This is at a time when 43 million people were already one-step away from famine.”Canada’s foreign minister, Mélanie Joly, told reporters: “We need to make sure that these cereals are sent to the world. If not, millions of people will be facing famine.” The G7 countries said they would expand sanctions on Russia and that they would not accept the new borders Russia is seeking to draw. They said: “We will never recognise borders Russia has attempted to change by military aggression, and will uphold our engagement in the support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea, and all states. “We reaffirm our determination to further increase economic and political pressure on Russia, continuing to act in unity.” They called on China not to aid Putin and “to desist from engaging in information manipulation, disinformation and other means to legitimise Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. Three weeks before Putin launched his war in Ukraine, the Russian president signed a pact with his Chinese counterpart that said there would be “no limits” to the two countries’ cooperation.",News/World news,"Moscow set to call referendum on Mariupol joining Russia, says Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/moscow-referendum-mariupol-joining-russia-ukraine-war
5/15/2022,"Ireland was the scene of a Boris Johnson masterclass in deception. In the 2019 election, he fooled millions into believing his “oven-ready deal” would “Get Brexit Done!” and we need not worry about the warnings of John Major, Tony Blair and Theresa May of the threat to the Northern Ireland settlement. Johnson’s straight lie that his withdrawal agreement would not put a border in the Irish Sea – “over my dead body,” he cried and yet the border is there and Johnson still lives – fooled the supposedly hard-nosed Democratic Unionist party. Finally, he conned the European Union into believing he was a man of his word when he signed a treaty confirming Northern Ireland’s special status that he had no intention of honouring. At every stage, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, has covered his back. She has disgraced herself, her office, her profession and her country. The attorney general is one of many peculiarly British constitutional checks on arbitrary power Johnson has blown away. On the one hand, the AG is a politician. On the other, he or she must uphold the rule of law and act independently of government. Johnson realised that no one could stop him appointing a sycophant who would do as he pleased. Braverman was just the stooge he needed. “She’s only there because she’s a Brexiter of the true faith,” said one legal figure who, like all my contacts from the intersection between law and government, spoke on condition of anonymity. Johnson “looked for malleable legal figures who would do his bidding and found Suella”, said a second. “I was at a Brexit meeting she hosted and it was staggering to realise she did not understand any of the problems,” a third added. “I suppose that’s why Johnson likes her.” Last week, Braverman justified Johnson’s decision to ignore the majority of voters in Northern Ireland as he tried to regain the trust of the Democratic Unionist party politicians he had so spectacularly cheated by ripping up the international treaty he had so sincerely promised to honour. You did not need to be a lawyer to grasp the speciousness of her special pleading. Braverman claimed that – “painfully” – it was necessary to cancel the deal because the EU had created “a trade barrier in the Irish Sea”. But it was Johnson who became prime minister by rejecting May’s plan to keep the whole of the UK close to the EU customs union and single market. Johnson proposed putting a border in the Irish Sea so the rest of the UK could have a hard Brexit. Johnson took the idea to the EU, won a general election on it, had his civil servants draw up a treaty that delivered it and signed it into international law. Braverman said the EU implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol was “unreasonable and disproportionate”. I defy you to read the protocol and show me where the EU has broken the agreement Johnson wanted. She concluded by displaying a contempt for her audience, and understandably herself, by saying that “trade is being diverted”. Obviously, trade is being diverted. Northern Ireland is in the single market and customs union. Its businesses are doing well out of it. So well, indeed, that businesses in the rest of the UK may want to join them. Hannah Arendt was not only describing dictatorships when she said: “Totalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.” Any hierarchical organisation under authoritarian leadership does the same. To understand how Braverman rose to an office that specifically demands the holder displays independent thought, her fanaticism and mediocrity must be balanced. In 2020, I reported on the false account she gave of her life. She ingratiated herself with the readers of the ConservativeHome website by claiming that, when she started as a barrister in London: “I was the shy Tory in my chambers of ‘right-on’ human rights lawyers. Despite the social stigma, I was inspired by Conservative values of freedom from an interventionist state.” But the chambers that she joined after leaving Cambridge University were anything but “right on”. She worked at 2-3 Gray’s Inn Square, which was filled with regular barristers fighting disputes about the licensing of pubs and betting shops, not human rights law. One of the supposed “right-on” lefties was a former Tory MP. The political advantages of posing as a victim of a snotty liberal elite were obvious. But cynical careerism does not explain every move. Vanity can matter as much. Braverman had an ordinary career at the bar, which she tried to make sound grander than it was by claiming to have contributed to authoritative legal textbooks. On inspection they bore no trace of her name. Her bravado suggests that at some level she may think that a shadowy liberal elite had stymied her rise in the law. Johnson offered her the chance for vengeance when he made her the country’s foremost law officer. Now she could show all those sneering liberals who believed in airy-fairy concepts such as governments honouring their word abroad and telling the truth to their voters at home who was boss. “A self-respecting attorney general would have resigned by now,” a former law officer told me. But Johnson chose well when he appointed Braverman. If he thought she would take a stand on principle, he would never have given her the job. Equally, if he doubted for a moment that she was not committed to attacking the EU, judicial review and the Human Rights Act, she would have remained an obscure backbencher. Her willingness to collude with a breach of international law seems a small matter. Tearing up the agreement with the EU will threaten western unity when we should be standing together against Russia. The EU may respond by starting a trade war, which will thump an economy already suffering from the battering Brexit, inflation and Covid administered. In Northern Ireland, the British government’s decision to take a nakedly sectarian stance in favour of a hardcore Protestant minority may threaten the fragile peace. The collapse of our institutions is still worth noticing, however. For all its contradictions, the office of attorney general once demanded respect. Now it is no better than being consigliere for a small-time crook.  Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The attorney general’s office was worthy of respect.

5/15/2022,"Thousands of people were taking part in protests across the US on Saturday to decry the supreme court’s expected reversal of the landmark 1973 law that made abortion legal in America. Demonstrators were gathering at more than 380 protest events being held from Maine to Hawaii, in cities including Washington DC, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, to demand that the right to an abortion is not stripped away by the court, which is dominated by rightwing justices. Holding signs that include slogans such as “Reproductive justice for all” and “We will not go back”, and chanting “My body, my choice”, the protesters have been spurred by the leak of a supreme court draft opinion on 2 May which showed that five of the rightwing justices on the nine-member court had voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the historic case that provided federal protection for abortion rights and proved a beacon in international efforts to improve the rights of women. In the US capital, protesters were gathering at the Washington Monument before marching to the supreme court, which is now surrounded by a security fence. “If it’s a fight they want, it’s a fight they’ll get,” said Rachel Carmona, executive director of the Women’s March, one of the groups, along with Planned Parenthood, UltraViolet and MoveOn that organized Saturday’s demonstrations, which they have called “Bans Off Our Bodies”. If the court were to end protections for abortion following the challenge brought by Mississippi, at least 26 US states, mostly in the south and midwest, would be certain or likely to outlaw abortion, forcing women to travel hundreds of miles to the nearest clinic, self-manage abortions with medication and heighten the risk of prosecution, abuse and violence for women and doctors. Even though a clear majority of Americans support in principle women’s right to have an abortion, the topic has long been a politically toxic one, with Republicans persistently pushing for the protections to be weakened or scrapped entirely. Oklahoma and Texas, both Republican-led states, have established bans on abortion after six weeks, while lawmakers in Louisiana recently mulled a bill that would charge women with murder should they end their pregnancy. Protest organizers stressed that abortion remains legal until the final supreme court decision. “Planned Parenthood health centers remain open, abortion is currently still legal, and we will continue to fight like hell to protect the right to access safe, legal abortion,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, chief executive of of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. People who have turned up at the protests spoke of their alarm over the prospect of losing a right that women have relied upon for the past 50 years. “How can they take away what I feel is a human right from us?” said Julie Kinsella, a teacher who took part in the New York protest. Kinsella said she felt “anger” and “outrage” when she heard the news of the draft opinion. “It just made me think: what direction is the US moving toward with that decision?” she said. “We have made so much progress up until this point. I would just hate to see us backtrack and fight for what we already have right now.” Teisha Kimmons, who traveled 80 miles to attend the Chicago rally, said she feared for women in states that are ready to ban abortion. She said she might not be alive today if she had not had a legal abortion when she was 15. “I was already starting to self-harm and I would have rather died than have a baby,” said Kimmons, a massage therapist from Rockford, Illinois. The prospect of looming bans on abortion in dozens of US states has provoked international, as well as domestic alarm. On Saturday, Dr Tlaleng Mofokeng, the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to health, told the Guardian that the US should not drop federal protections for abortion. “It sends chills down my spine to think that the court is being brought on to play – as a very powerful player – to decide on an issue of human rights that has jurisprudence, and has a basis in legal findings, that will actually lead to restriction of rights,” said Mofokeng. The primary concern of Clarence Thomas, however, appears to be the leak itself. Thomas, a conservative supreme justice, said the release of the draft opinion to Politico was “tremendously bad”. The judge, whose wife Virginia repeatedly urged Donald Trump’s chief of staff to take steps to overturn the 2020 election won by Joe Biden, told a conference in Dallas: “I wonder how long we’re going to have these institutions at the rate we’re undermining them. And then I wonder when they’re gone or destabilized, what we’re going to have as a country.”",News/US news,‘We will not go back’: Thousands rally for abortion rights across the US ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/14/abortion-rights-protests-us-roe-v-wade
5/15/2022,"A former armed response officer awarded nearly £1m by Police Scotland over victimisation said the past few years had been “torturous” and no amount of compensation could make up for the pain experienced. Rhona Malone began her action against the force after a senior police officer said he did not want to see two female armed officers deployed together when there were sufficient male staff on duty. An employment tribunal heard how Insp Keith Warhurst cited “the obvious differences in physical capacity” and a “balance of testosterone” as reasons for the decision. When Malone challenged Warhurst, he denied being sexist and threatened to suspend her from duty because she was not acting in a “calm/restrained and controlled manner”. The employment tribunal also heard of other instances of sexist and misogynistic behaviour, including Warhurst distributing images of topless women on an internal WhatsApp group, Warhurst describing the pregnant wife of another officer as “a fucking fat bitch”, and a senior officer telling one female firearms officer to “fuck off” when she requested a two-piece uniform instead of a boiler suit, to make it easier to use the toilet. The tribunal found there was an “absolute boys’ club” culture within the armed response unit in Edinburgh where Malone had worked. In its judgment in October last year, the tribunal upheld Malone’s claims of victimisation but dismissed her claim of direct discrimination. Malone said no amount of compensation will “ever make up for the pain or sacrifices” she had made – including incurring costs in the region of six figures – but hoped winning would “benefit many women now and in the future”. However, she criticised both Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Federation, the body that represents rank and file officers, saying that they had “failed” her and “grossly underestimated my determination for acknowledgment and accountability”. Malone said in a statement to PA Media that her “quest for justice” had “come at great personal risk” adding that it was “sadly one that could have so easily been avoided”. She said: “At long last I have closure to what has been an excruciating and torturous few years, but one that I hope will benefit many women now and in the future. “It is important for me to say that had the individuals in positions of trust and authority who victimised and suppressed my pursuit for acknowledgment and accountability been honest, shown moral integrity and empathy for my situation, then perhaps Police Scotland could have taken the opportunity to communicate and evidence a far more progressive and inclusive organisation. “This would have empowered police officers and made Scotland proud.” Malone also said that had she received “care and support from the Scottish Police Federation then perhaps Police Scotland would not have responded with contempt or attempted to suppress and deny me justice”. Her comments came after it was revealed a settlement had been agreed with Police Scotland in which Malone will receive £947,909.07. The settlement also includes a personal apology to Malone from chief constable Iain Livingstone. In a statement issued on Friday, the force apologised for “its poor response when a dedicated and promising officer raised legitimate concerns. The chief constable also emphasised his personal commitment to leading change in policing in Scotland, which drives equality and inclusion to improve the experiences of all women, including our own officers and staff.”",News/UK news,Former Police Scotland officer hopes ‘torturous’ tribunal win will help women,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/former-police-scotland-officer-hopes-torturous-tribunal-win-will-help-women
