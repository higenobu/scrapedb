3/19/2022,"In a career that spanned three continents and in the early 1990s included the editorship of the Daily Mirror, David Banks, who has died aged 74 of pneumonia, showed a flair for dealing with challenges. Though the business is renowned for cynicism, back-stabbing and disloyalty, he navigated his way through newsrooms around the world leaving nothing but friends in his wake. The episode that most severely tested the widespread good relations that “Banksy” enjoyed came when he left the Sun in 1985 as its assistant editor, apparently to spearhead the launch of Rupert Murdoch’s new London evening newspaper. He would be based in a new building in a part of the East End of London that few of us in the conference room for his send-off that evening had heard of, let alone visited. However, it proved to be an elaborate ruse. Within days David flew to New York for a crash course in producing newspapers using computer technology. Six months later, in January 1986, when the Sun, the News of the World, the Times and the Sunday Times decamped overnight to Wapping, David was there, ready to teach hundreds of confused journalists how to master screen-based writing and editing. He had not hinted to even his closest friends that he knew of, and would be a part of, the huge upheaval to come. Born in Warrington, Cheshire, David was the son of Helen (nee Renton) and Arthur Banks, a foreman at British Aluminium. He grew up on a council estate, and on leaving Boteler grammar school (now Sir Thomas Boteler Church of England high school) at the age of 16 he joined the Warrington Guardian. He took work – but not himself – seriously, a self-deprecating sense of humour being one of his greatest strengths. He had an instinctive skill for writing punchy, attention-grabbing headlines and being able to captivate an audience in the pub or the boardroom. His oversized character – at 6ft 5in tall, he was a substantial figure – secured moves from Warrington to the Journal, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then to the Daily Mirror’s Manchester operation. It did not take long for the Mirror’s head office to come calling, and he prospered in London as production editor. His friend and mentor Kelvin MacKenzie possessed an uncanny ability to spot talent. In 1979 he recruited David to join him at the New York Post, where he had been dispatched by Murdoch to introduce the US to Fleet Street-style tabloid journalism. As assistant managing editor, David helped energise a moribund newspaper, and when MacKenzie became editor of the Sun in 1981, David was not far behind, as night editor and later assistant editor. In the Bouverie Street newsroom it was daunting to be confronted by this giant of a man, your copy in his hand, as he needed the answer to a glaringly obvious mistake in the story – “Mate, mate, go back and ask him this” – but he rarely raged or yelled. His frustrations were only born of a determination to make the newspaper the best. He was the first to help reporters, particularly young ones, hone their craft. The Wapping revolution was a gruelling experience for journalists ferried in armoured buses past angry picket lines in and out of the News International compound every day. Whatever he may have felt personally, David was the ideal colleague for the moment, inexplicably breaking into the chorus from Oklahoma! during the darkest moments. As one of the few people to understand the new computer system, he was asked by the Sunday Times to help lay out pages. A headline was suggested but David could not make Trade Talks Falter on Great Wall of China fit the allotted space. Desperate to meet deadline, he summoned up his tabloid creativity, admitting that for one edition the headline memorably read Trade Talks Falter on Big Wall of China – one of the many stories he was happy to tell against himself. He also wrote a Saturday opinion column for the Sun – Banks of England. At the end of 1986 he left News International to join the New York Daily News. As deputy managing editor, in effect the No 3, he cast a huge shadow, literally and figuratively, over the newsroom in its celebrated East 42nd Street building. His task was to reinvigorate the News, his first edition hitting the streets with a front-page story about a gruesome murder, the headline CHOPPED TO PIECES printed at twice the newspaper’s traditional size. Pushing himself around the editorial floor on a roller chair, he urged the bemused staff to think bigger, bolder and brasher. While his Fleet Street stories and northern charisma left an impression still talked about when I became editor-in-chief of the News five years later, it was a brief and difficult marriage. He rejoined the Murdoch organisation in 1987, sent to be deputy editor of the Australian and then editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph-Mirror. He enjoyed six years of hard work in Australia, leavened by long family barbecues, and to many of us it seemed that he had found his natural home. In 1992 he returned to London as editor of the Daily Mirror, a newspaper that in many ways most naturally reflected his politics. David wanted the Mirror to return to its roots as a campaigning tabloid, dealing less with celebrity news, with a mission to help those with no voice. Sadly it proved a poisoned chalice, as cost-cutting was already eating away at national newspapers. Despite his physical presence, David was a sensitive man. He resented being instructed to cull staff and left the editor’s chair in 1994. After some less important roles at the Mirror Group, he reinvented himself as a radio host. From presenting LBC’s breakfast show (1997-99), he went to join his former newspaper colleague Nick Ferrari at Talk Radio (1999-2000), venting his feelings about politicians (for whom he had not a lot of regard), business moguls (even less) and celebrities (don’t ask). In recent years, suffering from ill health, he found that his career had come full circle as he wrote columns for his old Newcastle paper, the Journal (2006-15), and then a local news website, voiceofthenorth.net, from his home in the Northumberland village of Crookham. He was passionate about football, rugby and cricket. A keen guitarist, he loved music, particularly folk music, once playing live with Lindisfarne. In 1975 he married Gemma Newton, the sister of a friend. She survives him along with their son, Tim, daughter, Tash, and grandchildren, Logan, Tyga and Xander.

3/19/2022,"It feels very Disney+ to have Cheaper by the Dozen premiering on the company’s streaming service, Disney+, in 2022. The family film is the remake of a remake – the 2022 version puts a new spin on the 2003 movie of the same name, which updated the 1950 movie based on the the semi-autobiographical novel by siblings Frank Butler Gilbreth Jr and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. It’s also potent nostalgia bait for young millennial parents; the 2003 version, starring Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt as the parents of 12 rowdy children, was a reliable (if tepidly reviewed) family-friendly staple of the 2000s whose brood contained a bevy of millennial-beloved stars – Hilary Duff, Piper Perabo, Tom Welling, Alyson Stoner. The 2022 version, directed by the Black-ish producer Gail Lerner from a script by the show’s creator, Kenya Barris, and writer/producer Jenifer Rice-Genzuk, makes several welcome updates to the formula of large family hijinks, but shares the 2003 film’s flat humor. There are too many moving parts to find a consistent groove; its tone wavers even more haphazardly from kids flick to marriage portrait to slapstick comedy to stark commentary on race, without nailing any particularly well and despite endearing commitment from its performers. The Disney+ version necessarily modernizes what had always been a uniformly white family at the center into a mixed group. In a cheesy but effectively succinct opening montage, Paul (Zach Braff) and Zoey Baker (Gabrielle Union), the interracial married co-runners of an all-day breakfast joint in Los Angeles, explain how their blended family came to be. Paul was married to the spacey, LA yoga girl Kate (Erika Christensen), with whom he had three kids (one, a child of South Asian descent named Haresh, played by Aryan Simhadri, was adopted as a baby). Zoey was married to NFL pro-bowler Dom (Timon Kyle Durrett), with whom she had two kids. Both marriages ended cheerily – “we agreed to close that chapter of our lives,” said twice – and Zoey and Paul fall in love at his diner. Two sets of twins later, the Bakers are up to nine kids. A foster situation – Paul’s sister, it’s mentioned with careful yet breezy sensitivity, goes to rehab, so the Bakers take in her (very lightly) troubled teenage son Seth (Luke Prael) – makes a full dozen. As with the 2003 film, the gist of Disney Plus’s remake is cheerful domestic chaos molded into light didacticism: the importance of the nuclear family (albeit a blended one, in this update) with reminders to not get blinded by financial success or the lure of growth. Paul decides to market his special sauce, and possibly franchise the restaurant, in order to help pay for a bigger home. The Bakers move from Echo Park, a middle-class neighborhood in LA proper, to Calabasas – “Kardashian country”, as one Instagram-savvy child puts it. The new mansion, bougie neighborhood and private school puts a strain on the family in obvious, predictable ways: eldest daughter Deja (Journee Brown, a standout among the ensemble), a basketball star, gets benched in favor of the teammate whose surname is on the gymnasium. The white country club parents do not take to Zoey, mistaking her as the nanny. The latter is one of several moments where the film seems unsure how it wants to handle the elephant in the room of racism. As a joke? (Zoey schooling a haughty, racist country club mom.) As a subtle condition to be addressed obliquely? (Paul telling Zoey, who feels out of place in Calabasas, that there are some places he doesn’t fit in, such as when she took him to a barber’s shop in Inglewood). As a teachable moment? (Dom, a black man skeptical of Paul, launches into a speech about how Paul will never be able to understand how it feels to be profiled by police, let alone prepare his black children for it.) All of the intentions are capital-G Good, all the politics and views firmly progressive, in a Disney sense, while being palatable. There is a utility for this, especially for young viewers, but the moralizing feels more like a brand straining to be correct rather than a family figuring things out. Still, some of the sillier material that’s painfully awkward for an adult viewer – Paul and Dom’s dance battle during Deja’s basketball game, Paul copping what he thinks is hip to impress younger potential investors – will probably play well for children, who enjoy TikTok dances and adults making fools of themselves. Braff and Union have passable chemistry, but Union’s charisma and confidence is magnetic in any context including this one. It’s all breezy – there are no bad actors or malicious intent (other than that one Calabasas woman), so the drama is light and the messes are quickly cleaned up. From an adult perspective, it seems unlikely that 2022’s Cheaper by the Dozen will engender the same loyalty as its predecessor, but who knows? Maybe in 2042, Gen Alpha parents will feel seen by Disney’s newest iteration of the Bakers.

3/19/2022,"The Metropolitan police will appeal against a high court ruling that they breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in their handling of the event. The Met said it had “taken time to consider with great care the decision itself and the wider implications for policing” and planned to appeal against the ruling “to resolve what’s required by law when policing protests and events in the future”, in a statement published on Friday. The ruling last week was hailed as a “victory for women”. The four women who founded Reclaim These Streets had brought a legal challenge against the Met over its warning that they would face fines of £10,000 each and possible prosecution if the socially distanced event they were planning to mourn Everard and protest against violence against women went ahead. Instead, a spontaneous vigil and protest took place. Jessica Leigh, Anna Birley, Henna Shah and Jamie Klingler said that the force had breached their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and that it did not assess the potential risk to public health. Everard, 33, was murdered by a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens. The vigil was to be held near to where she went missing in Clapham, south London, in March last year. The Met’s statement said: “It’s absolutely right that we are held to account for our actions and that there is proper scrutiny of the decisions we make as a police force in upholding legislation and maintaining public order. “We also respect the strong views held by Reclaim These Streets in defence of human rights and public protest, and their pursuit of justice for these views. “As an organisation we work with, support and police hundreds of protests and events across London every day, and take our responsibilities under the Human Rights Act in doing so very seriously.”",News/UK news,Met to appeal against ruling on handling of Sarah Everard vigil,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/met-to-appeal-against-ruling-on-handling-of-sarah-everard-vigil
3/19/2022,"Fifty years ago, at a rowdy meeting at the Hobart town hall, the world’s first “green” party was formed. While the word Green was not officially used, and it would take some time for the United Tasmania Group to be formally registered as a political party, it was the beginning of an organised effort to use the political system to push for a spotlight on environmental issues. The UTG was born of a desire to stop the state’s powerful Hydro Electric Commission from flooding pristine Lake Pedder, in the state’s rugged south-west wilderness. And, for that fight, the UTG deserves formal recognition as the first green political party to contest an election anywhere in the world. Both the Labor and Liberal parties were committed to the Hydro’s policy of damming every wild river in the state to generate cheap electricity. The fight for Lake Pedder had been brewing ever since the Menzies government funded a road cut into the south-west wilderness, putting conservationists on high alert. There was nothing quite like Pedder anywhere – a glacial outwash Lake, with a mile-long beach of pink quartzite sand, and a dozen endemic species. The natural wonder came to be recognised nationally and internationally. Compounding the sense of grief and outrage, the dam made no economic sense: Tassie had enough power and the Hydro was only proposing to use the Lake as dead water storage. At a Hobart exhibition by the passionate nature photographer Olegas Truchanas – simply slides of his pictures of Pedder, set to the music of Sibelius – people walked out in tears. Dr Richard Jones, a former vice-president of the Queensland Country Party, was a botanical scientist who moved to the University of Tasmania in 1970. After visiting Pedder he began working with the Lake Pedder Action Committee. For Jones, Pedder was symptomatic of a wider problem. As he wrote in one 1971 lecture: “Concern for the environment is completely unrepresented in our governments.” One of the original campaigners, geomorphologist Kevin Kiernan, described Jones as one of the most strategic thinkers he had ever met – a real “chess master”. In Sydney, Milo Dunphy had been the first dedicated conservationist to run for parliament in Australia, contesting the New South Wales state election in 1971. Dunphy joined the Lake Pedder campaign and, after twice visiting Tasmania, wrote heartfelt letters to Rupert Murdoch’s The Australian calling for the flooding to be halted. Dunphy, Jones and Kiernan were constantly in touch by letter. In February 1972, Dunphy got word that the sole Centre party member of the Tasmanian parliament, Kevin Lyons, was about to cross the floor, robbing the Bethune Liberal government of its single-seat majority and almost certainly forcing an election. The Colong Committee, which Dunphy was a member of, minuted plans to run “total environment” candidates in Tasmania, and Dunphy announced that the Lake Pedder Action Committee would fly him down to Hobart to help run the campaign. When the election was called, a meeting was scheduled at the Hobart town hall for 23 March, with ads running in the Mercury featuring the stylised triangles – representing the saw-toothed “mega-ripples” of the lake’s edge – that would become the logo of the new UTG. Jones and his mates had word that the Hydro had planned to stack the hall with 200 engineers. And there was plenty of rowdy and fiery debate that evening. But eventually, there was support for the landmark resolution: “In order that there is a maximum usage of a unique political opportunity to save Lake Pedder … there be formed a Single Independent Coalition of primarily conservation-oriented candidates”. The coalition was called the United Tasmania Group, and its first campaign was under way. The UTG may have had no candidates elected in 1972 – in the four seats they contested, they averaged 4.9% of the vote – and they did not direct preferences (Jones believed neither major party deserved them). The Bethune government was punished for instability, and Labor’s “Electric” Eric Reece was returned in a landslide. And there was no reprieve for Lake Pedder and it was flooded. A rearguard action by the Whitlam Labor government, led by environment minister Moss Cass, who hoped to reverse the flooding and restore it, proved too little, too late. But the UTG refused to give up on Pedder, keeping up pressure over the Lake, formally establishing itself as a political party and fleshed out a policy platform which was bursting with new ideas for the future of the state. In 1975 a young doctor from NSW who had moved to Launceston, Bob Brown, inspired and mentored by Jones, ran second to him on the UTG’s Senate ticket. The following year a handful of mostly UTG members gathered for a strategy meeting at Brown’s house in Liffey Falls, resolving to form the Wilderness Society andcampaign for conservation using non-violent direct action. Brown would lead the Wilderness Society to a spectacular win in the Franklin Dam campaign, after the Hawke Labor government delivered on a promise to save the wild river in the lead-up to the 1983 election. Brown sat for the next decade as spiritual leader of a growing number of green-minded independents in Tasmania and around the country. He would go on to co-found the Australian Greens in 1992 and then represent the party in the Senate from 1998 until 2012. The UTG petered out after a disappointing result at the 1977 elections, although it has since been revived. The party may not have led directly to the formation of the Australian Greens – activist movements for the environment, social justice and peace had to coalesce before that would become possible, and that process would take 20 years. But there is no doubt that the seed of a new green political party was sown in the Hobart town hall in March 1972 when a few hundred people resolved overwhelmingly that no existing party would do enough to confront an environmental crisis, looming even then, or just as importantly save Lake Pedder and its pink sandy beach … which remains intact, submerged, 50 years later.",News/Australia news,How the fight to save Tasmania’s Lake Pedder led to the world’s first green party,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/how-the-fight-to-save-tasmanias-lake-pedder-led-to-the-worlds-first-green-party
3/19/2022,"Josh Frydenberg has flagged he is “open” to further market interventions making insurance more affordable, but says more preparatory work will need to be done before the Morrison government would extend its $10bn cyclone reinsurance pool in northern Australia to cover more natural disasters. In an interview with Guardian Australia ahead of the budget on 29 March, the treasurer said he was conscious that a changing climate rendered insurance problematic in some parts of Australia. Frydenberg said the cleanup after catastrophic flooding in New South Wales and Queensland would be a focal point in his pre-election economic statement. Asked whether he would extend the current reinsurance scheme in line with a recent call from the scheme’s principal architect, the veteran Liberal Warren Entsch, Frydenberg said: “There’s more work to be done.” “I’m open to finding ways to make insurance more accessible and affordable,” the treasurer said. “I’m conscious that many people in flood- and fire-prone zones are either underinsured or not insured at all because the cost of insurance can be prohibitively high.” Asked whether he was happy with the reinsurance model, which had been controversial with both the insurance sector and Australia’s consumer regulator before its ultimate adoption by the Coalition, Frydenberg said: “It’s early days but it’s been well received and there was a lot of work done. “But I’m not creating expectations. There are questions about how to make that workable, so we’ll have to get further work done.” Legislation giving effect to the current proposal, which covers cyclones and related flood damage, has already passed the House of Representatives and is expected to clear the Senate during budget week. The scheme is supposed to be operational by July. The current reinsurance pool model for cyclones and related flood damage covers residential, strata and small business property insurance policies in northern Australia. Entsch, the north Queensland MP, told Guardian Australia earlier this month recent disasters, including the recent floods, had made the case to apply the government guarantee more broadly a “no-brainer”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Morrison government is hoping the looming March budget will create a political springboard into the election the prime minister will call shortly after. A raft of polls suggest Labor would win an election held today. The economic statement is expected to contain cash payments providing cost-of-living relief for low and middle income earners, as well as spending on security and defence and on local manufacturing and regional infrastructure, including new hydrogen proposals for the energy transition. With fuel prices soaring, and other consumer prices on the rise, the government faces political pressure to assist households given wages growth is persistently sluggish. The government favours short-term cash payments to help with rising petrol and grocery prices in order to avoid building structural spending into the budget bottom line. Asked whether the Reserve Bank of Australia could lift interest rates while Australia was on an election footing, Frydenberg said that was ultimately a decision for the central bank. But he said the RBA, based on its public commentary, would be monitoring inflation and employment and looking for signs of wages growth before increasing the official cash rate. With the latest labour force statistics confirming Australia’s unemployment rate fell to 4% in February, down from 4.2% in January and its lowest level since 2008, the government will attempt to engage disadvantaged and disengaged young Australians in labour market readiness programs. The budget will contain a $46.8m pre-employment program for people between the ages of 15 and 24. The government says the program will provide community-focused interventions including training and work experience. In another pre-budget announcement, the government has also earmarked about $75m in additional support for travel agents and tour providers, following pandemic-related disruptions. The tourism minister, Dan Tehan, said the targeted program would “support travel agents and tour arrangement service providers to meet ongoing costs of running outlets, continue to process rebookings and provide high-quality customer service to their customers”. Asked whether the government was serious about moving past fiscal support for businesses hard hit by the Covid-19 pandemic even if new variants necessitated a public health response – a position Frydenberg has publicly signalled – he said the days of “large economy-wide-scale support has ended”.",News/Australia news,Josh Frydenberg open to intervening in insurance market as climate change pushes up premiums,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/josh-frydenberg-open-to-intervening-in-insurance-market-as-climate-change-pushes-up-premiums
3/19/2022,"It feels more than uncomfortable to be writing a column about a woman who died suddenly just over a week ago at the age of 52. Uncomfortable because the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching is no longer here to exercise the judgments that inevitably shape how, when and on what terms her story is told. Other players featuring in the reported cameos of Kitching’s last months in public life also feel constrained in how they respond, either out of self-preservation, or because contesting the recollections and confidences of a recently deceased woman feels unseemly. But Kitching’s allies and many friends are mourning with the visceral grief that accompanies a sudden and terrible loss – and they are talking. Anthony Albanese has spent a chunk of this past week trying to nudge Labor past the controversy. But Kitching’s supporters have made it clear to colleagues they don’t appreciate others mandating ground rules for how and when the late senator’s life should be discussed. There has been internal umbrage about policing the terms of the discussion. The tussle over Kitching’s story, and who can assert the right to tell it, speaks to the corrosive impact of power plays, second guessing and mistrust in professional politics. If you’ve imbibed the dominant media narrative of the week, you’ll have read that Kitching was allegedly bullied and ostracised in the months leading up to her death by the “mean girls” of Labor’s Senate leadership team: Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher. On Friday, the three issued a joint statement flatly denying that bullying had occurred. If you are reading some of the coverage on the fly, you might gain an impression that Kitching was helpless in the face of arbitrary bitchy hostility – something of a victim. I wasn’t a media intimate of the late Victorian senator, but this characterisation doesn’t really capture the person. Kitching, in my observation, was formidable. It’s why she was widely respected. Highly intelligent, charming and shrewd, she was a power player in every sense of that word – an experienced factional operator and a consummate networker, entirely fluent in the blood sport of Victorian Labor politics. To imply otherwise is a disservice to truth. It robs Kitching of agency, and reduces a talented and complex woman to the role of untethered ghost in a history war. But people are complicated and contradictory creatures. Like any human, she could also be vulnerable, and Kitching’s friends and allies insist she was isolated and ostracised by some of her Labor colleagues – a trend that intensified in the months before her untimely death. She raised this with a number of people. Some of the underlying friction, I suspect, was caused by basic philosophical differences. Kitching was, by disposition, a cold war Catholic, an anti-communist hawk. Once upon a time, the Labor party used to brim with cold war Catholics, but these days most of them have migrated to the Liberal party. The centre of gravity in modern Labor is post-material progressive, not conservative. Some of Kitching’s political and policy instincts – and she was ambitious and self-confident enough to pursue them whether that was convenient for senior people or not – went against the grain. In the way of politics, some internal battles were overt, some subterranean. Then there was her modus operandi. Kitching maintained a substantial personal network outside her own tribe. She cultivated friendships with political opponents, and pursued relationships with commentators and journalists on her own terms. Kitching roamed regularly and widely outside the chain of command, gathering and sharing information. The substantial footprint of her extensive network can be measured in the tone and scale of eulogising after her death, and in some of the media narratives of this past week. Cultivating personal networks is hardly a crime against the Labor party. It’s smart and entirely proper for politicians to build the coalitions they need to advance the greater good, or to further their own career interests. Everyone in politics does this to a greater or lesser extent. But given Canberra has become more hierarchal, pugilistic and tribal over the 20-plus years I’ve been ringside, Kitching’s independence generated suspicion from some colleagues. There were significant trust issues, and they triggered periodic confrontations that Kitching doubtless found very bruising. We also need to surface another largely undeclared dynamic lurking behind this story. Persisting with hierarchies and tribes, the alleged “mean girls” – Wong, Keneally and Gallagher – are all close to each other, and to Anthony Albanese. Kitching’s most significant and enduring relationship in public life was with the former Labor leader Bill Shorten, a mate who brought her into parliament in 2016. Shorten waited with her husband, Andrew Landeryou, after Kitching died in her car last Friday. The thought of that vigil is gut wrenchingly sad. It’s fair to say Albanese and Shorten are not close, and in the piranha pen of politics, behaviours of principals and surrogates are always parsed to the nth degree. Politics is inherently a high-conflict, low-trust environment, and non-conforming behaviour is routinely interpreted as provocative proxy warring, whether it is or not. Often these interpretations are correct, because politics is studded with corrosively ambitious people playing constant three-dimensional chess. These people also know each other’s habits intimately, because most of them have been jousting and jockeying among themselves since they were adolescents. But sometimes the paranoia that builds up in the Canberra cloisters colours interpretation. In these cases, innocent forays are assigned greater meaning. In any case, Kitching’s death, and the roiling around it, has exposed a rupture that persists in Labor after the trauma of losing the so-called unlosable 2019 election. What the past 10 years tells us is Australia’s major parties lack the collective emotional intelligence, the quality of mercy or, frankly, the rudimentary human resources capability, to deal cathartically and productively with the fallout of leadership transitions, whether they are managed or regicidal. Given these transitions now happen at pace, this presents a significant problem. One last relevant factor is Kitching’s preselection. Anxiety about that was supercharging some of the tensions. At the moment, the national executive is calling the shots with Victorian preselections, because a branch-stacking scandal precipitated a federal intervention in the branch. Because the left faction has the numbers on the national executive, Kitching was rendered vulnerable in the event frenemies in the right suddenly decided she was surplus to requirements and someone else was owed a prize. Kitching’s right faction in Victoria is also in flux because the scandal triggered a realignment in the power blocs. So there was certainly active speculation around about her future. The sum of these parts lead inexorably to this conclusion: Kitching was under significant professional stress at the time of her passing. Now stress tends to go with the territory in politics. People experience it themselves, and they inflict it on others. But Kitching’s personal triggers – feeling isolated in Canberra, and deprived of the comfort of a stable power base in Melbourne – overlapped and intersected. On the flipside of this terribly sad human story are Kitching’s colleagues, another bunch of complicated humans, who reacted to what they regarded as disloyalty and internecine brinkmanship at the expense of the current leadership both in the Senate and the party – with an election in sight that none of these people want to lose. My point here is simple. Conflicts are always plural. There is never just one perspective, and suffice to say, all of that is one a hell of a brew. This is fundamentally a story about politics, and the way politics is practised in contemporary times. The story isn’t pretty because the arena can be hostile to humans. Politics needs a culture correction. The way many politicians conduct themselves – the way power is routinely exercised, through rolling cycles of provocations and punishments, the gaslighting and the reverse gaslighting – would not be tolerated in other professional workplaces. Brutality – both dished out and returned – is normalised as the “rough and tumble” of politics. People don’t ask themselves often enough whether this culture needs to be the default. The Jenkins review, triggered by more sad stories than I have strength to tell you about – some that have been told, and some that will never be told – found that power imbalances and misuse of power were primary drivers of a toxic culture, and the media are certainly not blameless here. For anyone who cares about the health of Australian democracy, that insight about abuses of power in the political ecosystem is the key takeout of the past 12 months, and it should remain front of mind. If we care about our collective future, we might want to experiment with something a bit more nourishing and soulful and sustainable than “whatever it takes”, and “what goes around, comes around”.",News/Australia news,Kimberley Kitching’s death and its aftermath are another glimpse into the routine brutality of Australian politics,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2022/mar/19/kimberley-kitchings-death-and-its-aftermath-are-another-glimpse-into-the-routine-brutality-of-australian-politics
3/19/2022,"For the second time in a month the Andrews government this week unfurled a big social reform to be funded by a levy on business. And for the second time in a month, it provoked outrage from the usual quarters, including the state opposition, the federal government and industry groups. But whereas February’s attempt to introduce a developer levy to pay for social housing was quashed within 10 days, the electoral politics of paid sick leave for casuals will be very different. In announcing the $246m two-year trial of paid sick leave, the premier, Daniel Andrews, said the pandemic had exposed the “completely and utterly toxic” nature of insecure work. Some casuals were forced to choose between going to work while infected with Covid, he said, putting their colleagues at risk; or feeding their families, given they couldn’t afford to call in sick. The trial will mean about 150,000 eligible casual and contract workers will receive up to five days a year of sick or carer’s pay each year at the national minimum wage, or about $772.60 a week. More than 2,000 people have already signed up, with 600 of them approved for the scheme so far. But like clockwork, industry groups released statements criticising the proposal, the federal industrial relations minister, Michaelia Cash, described it as a “tax on jobs and a handbrake on our economy”, and the state opposition indicated it could scrap the trial if elected in November. Much of the criticism centred upon Andrews’ comments made in an interview with Guardian Australia, during which he confirmed that while the government was paying for the trial, any ongoing scheme would be funded by an industry levy. “It’s not a matter of, ‘can business afford to support this?’ It’s a question of, ‘can all of us afford not to do this’,” he said. Andrews was unapologetic about targeting taxes at specific groups in order to fund his reform agenda. This is despite his government, just days before the interview, was forced to dump another levy that would’ve slugged developers to fund new social housing. While Andrews will tell you the backdown had nothing to do with backlash from industry, the proposal had many within Labor’s ranks panicked. It would’ve ultimately meant first-home buyers in outer suburbs (read: Labor voters) would’ve had to pay more for their property. It handed the opposition a golden opportunity to target the government in its heartland over housing affordability. They had already begun calling it a “housing tax”. The sick leave trial, however, has the support of the unions and a huge cohort of Labor voters. “It speaks to the young inner-urban professional, it speaks to the young person that is working in hospitality as they study to get another job, the mum who works casual shifts, or the migrants in the outer suburbs who have only ever known casual employment or temporary contract work,” said Kosmos Samaras, a former Labor campaign strategist turned pollster. “The electoral politics of it is quite profound.” Samaras said research conducted by his firm RedBridge before the pandemic had found casual workers were a growing constituency. In 2019, there were more than 650,000 casual workers in Victoria. In 2021 it dipped to about 600,000. “It’s a real generational divide. For anyone under the age of 50, they at some time in their life have worked in a casual job and even if they have moved on, they are empathetic to those workers,” he said. There is also a generational divide when it comes to support for Andrews. The latest Roy Morgan poll, conducted in November 2021, showed approval of Andrews’ handling of his job is heavily correlated to age. A large majority of young Victorians aged under 35 (72%) approve of his handling of the job, compared with only 28% who disapprove. This approval declines progressively with age: 62.5% of those aged 35-49 and 61% of those aged 50-64 approve of Andrews’ handling of the job, while this drops to only 55% of people aged 65 and older. A Newspoll conducted that same month showed women aged under 34 were most likely to approve of his pandemic performance while men 65 and older were most likely to disapprove. Andrews knows that in order to hold on to as many seats as possible at the next election, he needs to keep young people on side. While the social housing levy is scrapped, his government will need to do more to address housing affordability. Much has also been made of Andrews’ comments that the “great Australian dream” of owning a home is less important to younger generations. He said some young people he knows would prefer to rent in a location that suits their lifestyle rather than buy in an area they can afford, so long as they have secure terms. This may be true for some. But for others, home ownership is not less important, rather, it’s unattainable.",Global,Victorian politics of paid sick leave is very different to developer levies,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/mar/19/victorian-politics-of-paid-sick-leave-is-very-different-to-developer-levies
3/19/2022,"Joanne Moody fell asleep to the sound of steady rain on a tin roof. When she got out of bed, Moody’s legs – “very unexpectedly” – sank knee-deep in water. On that night of 25 February, the nearby creek burst its banks and water rose through her corrugated-iron cabin in the woods of Beerwah, near the Glass House Mountains, in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. The events that followed would result in Moody becoming one of the thousands of Queenslanders displaced by widespread flooding – a disaster that’s thrown them at the mercy of a housing market already in the grips of crisis. It is a crisis that urgently demanded a government response on the magnitude of the one Covid triggered, says the St Vincent de Paul state chief, Kevin Mercer. Mercer says the charity was seeing several hundred people seek assistance every week – a number he said was growing on a daily basis. He says his organisation is working on an estimate that 20,000 homes are affected by flooding, over an area that sprawled from Gympie south to the Gold Coast and into New South Wales. “When you look at it in the context of housing, that’s 20,000 that need housing on top of the 50,000 people we already had on the housing waiting list before the floods.” Mercer says. “So these things are just compounding into a housing crisis that we already had.” Mercer says drastic action is needed to give tens of thousands of Queenslanders hope. But more on hope later. Because last month, as the flood waters swirled around her, Moody was not afforded the luxury of thinking about the long term. She shoved some valuables on high shelves, grabbed her phone and waded – barefoot through waist-deep water in only the T-shirt and shorts in which she had slept. Even her wallet was left behind. When she opened the front door, the water gushed in to even higher levels. Soon, SES volunteers arrived on a boat to rescue Moody and the family who owned the Beerwah property on which she rented. A whirlwind of events followed. The owner of her property paid for an Airbnb, the proprietor of which donated clothing. After two nights, the property owner drove Moody 30 minutes up the Bruce Highway to Nambour. “She left and I was there with a bag of clothes, not quite knowing where to go,” Moody says. “So I rang the homeless line.” They directed her to a flood evacuation centre, where a charity worker drove her 20 minutes back down the Bruce to another centre at a university in Sippy Downs. Another night passed and she was driven south again, almost back to Beerwah, to stay at a Landsborough motel, courtesy of Vinnies. Nothing of much financial value remains at the cabin. Some possessions could be salvaged. Quilts her mother made, her dad’s old watch – mementoes of parents now passed. The Seagull cherry oak guitar she has lugged around with her for years. Cook books, which helped inspire a career change to cheffing after more than a decade working in child protection. A laptop. Other belongings are wrecked. Her car. The washing machine and fridge. The laptop charger. Her record collection, including special-edition Pearl Jam and Jeff Buckley albums. Journals and notes from her 47 years of life. “It was only observational stuff, there wasn’t anything of great, Nobel prize-winning literature,” Moody says. “In a way it was refreshing, to wipe the slate clean.” Moody is similarly philosophical about the institutional response to the flood. She received a text with a general flood warning, but the rain fell inconsistently in the days prior. So when Moody went to bed that night, she was totally unprepared for the life-threatening situation to which she would wake. The speed at which the SES responded was “pretty impressive”. The neighbours, “God love ’em”, provided a hot shower and a cuppa. “In that emergency stage of a flood, people respond to what people need immediately: food, water, clothing,” she says. “Clothes are definitely not a problem in a flood, let me tell ya.” But despite everything she has already been through, the greatest uncertainties for Moody lie ahead. She is in motel room, paid for less than a fortnight. “I’m not too sure what will happen after that,” she says. “I’m looking for properties but nothing has come up yet.” Others displaced by the floods are relying on family or friends for emergency accommodation. The Queensland Reconstruction Authority says it finished this week assessing 16,500 homes and commercial buildings, of which nearly half were flood-affected. The number of people affected, however, is likely to be higher than the number of homes. Ellen Loeffel, 25, and her doberman, Xena, are now living downstairs in a friend’s Queenslander in Brisbane’s inner-northern suburb of Albion. She too speaks about the rapidity with which her life changed. For her it was on the last Sunday of February. “I was keeping an eye on the water in the back yard,” Loeffel says. “I went outside to check – and suddenly the water was in the house.” Loeffel had enough time to carry the TV upstairs and get out with a bag of clothes and her dog. She has been crashing with a friend since. She plans on moving back in, but the owners need to wait for an insurance assessment before renovations can start. While she lost most of her possessions, she’s OK. She owns a place in Ipswich and rents in Brisbane to be closer to her work as a personal trainer. Mercer says the crisis demanded a suite of short-term responses. Holiday rentals should house flood evacuees. Commonwealth rent assistance needed to be indexed to property prices. Welfare support should match the soaring cost of food and fuel. The National Rental Affordability Scheme needed to be retained, not scrapped. But, ultimately, the crisis demanded a long-term commitment to build “serious numbers of social and affordable housing stock”, Mercer says. “We are talking tens of billions of dollars. We really need a broader vision, not just a reactive response, because a lot of people are feeling quite hopeless. They need a vision and they need hope.”",News/Australia news,‘I rang the homeless line’: How Queensland’s floods compounded a housing crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/i-rang-the-homeless-line-how-queenslands-floods-compounded-a-housing-crisis
3/19/2022,"Kevin “Rusty” Adams’ home flooded in 2011, in 2017, and again in 2022. He has lived in Brisbane’s Paddington area his entire life – and no flood is going to drive him from the community or his home in the low-lying area near Rosalie Village. “That’s a daunting thought,” Rusty said, when asked if he’d ever considered leaving. “I’ve got four other brothers who live up the coast and they want me to move up. But this is where I live.” In the aftermath of the floods that hit Queensland and northern NSW this month, some communities are reckoning with a harsh and climate-fuelled reality: that their homes may become uninsurable or even uninhabitable. Some are questioning whether to rebuild. Others have called for property buybacks. There has also been plenty of commentary about the need for “climate resilience”, without much – if any – detail about what that term really means. Rusty said that to understand climate resilience, take a look at his place. About a year ago, as part of a Brisbane city council program to help renovate flood-prone homes, the ground-floor unit was retrofitted to cope with inundation. Skirting boards were replaced with wall tiles up to the highest level defined in the council’s flood mapping. Waterproof kitchen and bathroom cabinets were installed. After the worst flood Rusty could remember came through, he lost some property, but was able to quickly clean up his place and keep living in the unit. “Because of the way they’d tiled the place I was able to put a hose right through my unit,” he said. “Really there was no structural damage to my place at all, because of the work these guys did. “The guy next door in unit two, beside me, he’s only a renter, he’d only been there for three or four weeks and he got done over. The drains just couldn’t handle it, on top of that we had a river coming down [the street].” As the floodwaters came through Brisbane’s older suburbs, the city’s traditional homes – Queenslanders and workers cottages – were in many cases able to allow water to flow underneath the floorboards. But in recent decades, many people have built rooms underneath these old homes, sometimes raising the old part of the house to allow for a more modern open-plan-living style. Planning rules in Brisbane do not require a development application to build within the existing envelope of a home; and the “build-under” has allowed many people to add bedrooms – and value – to their property at relatively low cost. “You can make relatively large increases in size quite quickly by building underneath [the house],” said John Macarthur, a professor of architecture at the University of Queensland. “There are a lot of structural issues behind this, but the principle one is land value – it’s just skyrocketed. “Banks and financial institutions will instruct people to capitalise their property at a certain rate. The more land prices go up, the more expensive the buildings have to be, and that’s expressed in size, numbers of rooms, number of car spaces, a lot of things that don’t fit on the lot the house was built for.” Architect James Davidson, whose practice specialises in climate adaptation and flood resilience, has been working with Brisbane council on a flood resilient homes program for the past few years. He oversaw the renovation of Rusty’s place. The traditional design of the Queenslander is “not really supportive of family living,” Davidson said. “The idea of having a separate living room, a separate kitchen, that’s sort of gone out the window. When it comes to Queenslanders, a lot of clients want to put kitchen and living area on the ground level, next to their backyard,” he said. “The problem we have is that the original Queenslander was built well above a flood line. Building underneath is an affordable approach for a lot of families. “I’m not that critical of people who build in under, because subconsciously … we think the hard infrastructure will save us. It’s a reminder we can’t trust dams, we can’t trust drainage and pipes. “So we need to look at accepting water and living with water and making it simple to recover from events like the one we’ve just had.” So what does “resilience” – this catch-all term tossed about frequently in recent weeks – actually look like? Some talk about raising dams and levees and home buybacks. But in the face of climate change, Davidson said it has to mean more than just physical adaptation. “Resilience is about community, it’s not about the house,” he said. “If the asset is good at protecting itself, then the broader thing [is] about being able to assist your community quicker. It’s not about the house at all, it’s about people. “All councils around the country that are affected by flooding recognise the legacy issue. I don’t blame anybody, nobody predicted we would be facing this level of climate change so quickly – I was personally expecting it to happen another 20 or 30 years. “There’s legacy issues about developing on a floodplain in the first place. But people don’t want to leave, they really don’t. Talks about buybacks are fraught with emotional drama. It’s problematic. We’re displacing community.” Davidson said buybacks would need to happen in the longer term – that properties that were acquired could then be used for water flow or retention to mitigate damage at those that remain. “It needs some thought and an understanding that it’s not just about homes, it’s about livelihoods, economies, culture and education for kids.” In the meantime, homes could be built or renovated like Rusty’s – using materials that won’t be damaged by floodwaters and can be easily cleaned – so floods don’t displace people in the longer term. Davidson said it was easy to criticise people who buy or build in a flood zone “when you’re not the one being affected”. “How do you displace an entire community without losing your sense of belonging?” he said. “It’s a big conversation that has to be had [about buybacks and climate resilience], but it needs to happen with a bit of thought, a bit of sensitivity.”",News/Australia news,‘Build-under’: the impacts of renovating the traditional 'Queenslander',https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/as-floods-worsen-some-say-it-is-time-to-rethink-how-queenslanders-build-for-the-future
3/19/2022,"State elections are not always of great interest to people beyond the borders, but today’s South Australian poll is getting more attention than usual as it comes in the lead-up to the May federal election. The latest poll shows Labor poised to tip out the Marshall government after just one term in power. It shows a swing of about 8%, putting Labor ahead 56 to 44 on a two-party preferred score. That election-winning lead is slightly bigger than the one federal Labor currently enjoys over the Coalition. Premier Steven Marshall’s government is clinging to minority power with just 22 seats of 47 in the House of Assembly after three of his MPs quit to join the crossbench. Labor holds 19 and there are six independents in the mix. Haydon Manning, an adjunct associate professor in politics, policy and global affairs at Flinders University, says there are many unknowns about the SA election outcome, and even more about what it might mean federally. He says it’s unusually hard to predict. That’s partly because of the polling – pollsters adjusted their methods after predicting a federal Labor win in 2019. It’s also because the swings are never uniform across the board. Each electorate – even each booth – can be swayed by hyperlocal issues. “The consensus is clearly that it’s with Labor. But do we believe the margin’s as big as it is?” Manning said. “It’s really hard to read.” Marshall and his Labor opponent, Peter Malinauskas, had a busy final day of campaigning on Friday. Marshall faced questions about his decision to open the then Covid-free state’s borders in November – he opened them in time for Christmas, knowing the pandemic would follow. The state was then hit with a wave of Omicron that saw many having to isolate for the festive season. “There’s no doubt that many businesses, many individuals have made sacrifices … but those sacrifices have kept our state safe and kept our economy strong,” he told the ABC. Malinauskas has attacked the government over ambulance ramping, a highly visible and highly emotive outward sign of trouble inside hospitals, and an issue that is dominating talkback radio. The government has attacked Malinauskas for only releasing Labor’s costings on Thursday, while spruiking its own economic credentials and talking up new investment in space and cutting edge technologies. The pair have bickered about costings of their policies, each accusing the other of lacking credibility. Local issues such as swimming pools, public transport and development decisions can swing different seats, and bigger pledges such as Labor’s bringing back the Adelaide 500 supercar race could be a winner in some seats and a loser in others. Marshall’s signature announcement was a $662 million city entertainment arena, Malinauskas pledged a $593 million hydrogen power plant. Manning says there are different concerns at a state level, but that it is clear any kudos leaders won from keeping Australia relatively safe in the pandemic has dissipated. That applies at both state and federal levels, he says. He quotes Labor veteran Geoff Anderson, who said “voters tend to say thank you for what you’ve done … but ask what are you going to do now?”. He believes Malinauskas’s success in the polls comes from the opposition leader’s focus on what he is going to do, as opposed to Marshall relying on what he has already done. Meanwhile, any predictions for the May election are made more complicated by a broader acceptance of debt and deficit in the wake of government pandemic spending. It’s also not clear how global insecurity will affect incumbency. However the votes fall, there is unlikely to be a result by Saturday night. More than 172,000 South Australians have cast an early vote, and more than 162,000 have cast a postal vote. With a voting population of about 1,267,000, that means about a quarter of the votes won’t be counted until the counting of Saturday’s votes are done. And if it’s a hung parliament and either side has to woo those independents, it might take even longer.",News/Australia news,‘Hard to read’: Labor is clear favourite in South Australia’s election – but local issues muddy the waters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/hard-to-read-labor-is-clear-favourite-in-south-australias-election-but-local-issues-muddy-the-waters
3/19/2022,"It’s hard to imagine many inside the New South Wales government were particularly upset with veteran Nationals backbencher Geoff Provest when he aimed both barrels at the prime minister over his response to the state’s flood disaster this week. Hardly the state government’s most prominent attack dog, Provest did not miss in his assessment of Scott Morrison after his north coast electorate of Tweed was inexplicably excluded from extra disaster funding announced by the prime minister last week. The decision was “deplorable”, Provest said, adding that he was personally “disgusted with the prime minister” and would struggle to vote for him at the upcoming federal election. “There’s a real venom out there directed at the prime minister that he doesn’t understand what’s occurring on the ground,” he told ABC radio. The backstory, if you missed it, was that when Morrison announced extra disaster funding payments for flood-affected individuals last week, it was restricted to areas surrounding Lismore, the Richmond Valley and Clarence Valley. All of them are in the federal seat of Page, held by the Nationals. Coincidentally, the areas excluded - Tweed, Ballina and Byron - all happened to be in the federal seat of Richmond, held by Labor. By Thursday afternoon the feds had backflipped, with minister for emergency management, Bridget McKenzie, announcing that following an assessment by the National Recovery and Resilience Agency the grants would be extended across the north of the state. But the saga fit neatly with the now-familiar impression of the Morrison government as either missing in action during a crisis, or else obsessed with creating political advantage wherever possible. “This is like a remake of the bushfires,” Provest helpfully added. Which, for the NSW government, may be the perfect comparison point – in that it’s a low bar that’s easy to outperform. It’s been clear this week that the state Coalition is keen to distance itself from its federal counterparts, with reports suggesting that senior NSW government MPs were frustrated with Canberra delaying new support packages - something Morrison denied - and that requests for Australian defence force support were ignored. It’s not a new dynamic. In a speech to economics thinktank CEDA last month, Perrottet joked about his frequent run-ins with the federal government, saying he had “got myself in trouble going after the commonwealth government at points in time”. “I’ve promised the prime minister I will deal with him via text message [rather than] through a public forum,” he quipped. More recently, the treasurer, Matt Kean, has taken on that role, criticising the federal government for failing to provide business support during Omicron, clashing with the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and suggesting that he supported a federal Icac. But it’s a particularly useful tactic when NSW’s own flood response has not been without fault, including revelations the State Emergency Service had warned about the impact of budget cuts on its capability in the northern rivers and questions about what exactly it is Resilience NSW does with its $1.4bn budget. Indeed, a year out from the next state election, things are hardly running smoothly in Macquarie Street. The government is grappling with a protracted industrial dispute with the state’s rail union, and knows more is coming down the line as teachers’ and nurses’ unions flex their muscles in a bid to do away with the increasingly controversial 2.5% wage cap on public sector workers. Add to that the ballooning costs on its centrepiece infrastructure commitments, teacher shortages and increasingly regular grants scandals, and it’s little wonder MPs such as Catherine Cusack and Don Harwin are headed for the exit. But unlike Morrison – who seems preternaturally inclined to perceived gaffes during emergencies – Perrottet’s response to the floods has been both pragmatic and (it feels weird to have to write this as a point of contrast to other politicians) human. He spent a significant amount of time in the flood-affected areas immediately following the disaster, while acknowledging the shortcomings of the response and quickly announcing a review into why so many people had been left to fend for themselves. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning And the relief packages announced by his government – such as the rental support announced last week – have won him some unlikely friends during the crisis. “I’m not a natural ally to the ultra-right wing of the Liberal party, but he’s been amazing,” the Ballina Greens MP, Tamara Smith, said this week. “He hasn’t been playing politics, which is refreshing. I think there is a real intention and will to do the right thing.” Which isn’t a blank cheque, of course. Smith also questioned Resilience NSW’s capacity to actually deliver support into the affected communities, and noted that the real “danger zone” would come in a few months’ time when the news cycle had moved on. But as politics in NSW enters an unofficial shutdown while Perrottet takes parental leave and the opposition steps back to give free air to its federal colleagues ahead of a likely election in May, the NSW government can be satisfied that, the more it is held up against the Coalition in Canberra, the better it looks.",News/Australia news,"Against the foil of the Morrison government, Dominic Perrottet’s flood response has been pragmatic",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/against-the-foil-of-the-morrison-government-dominic-perrottets-flood-response-has-been-pragmatic
3/19/2022,"Many Australians have little pause to deeply consider their interactions with police. But for many First Nations families, interactions with police and the judicial system are imbued with violent and often deadly experiences handed down through the generations and correspondingly documented by the white state. A critical final finding of the Colonial Frontier Massacres Digital Map Project – that half the massacres of Aboriginal people on the Australian frontier were carried out by government forces, including police – reinforces how contemporary Indigenous deaths at the hands of state law enforcement agencies are part of a history of violence that began with European invasion in 1788. Memories of terrible massacres perpetrated by police on the colonial and postcolonial frontier remain at the forefront of the sensibilities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Until recently the survivors of some of the most brutal attacks were still alive; the Central Land Council’s remarkable Every Hill Got a Story project documents the disturbing first-hand oral accounts of some, including the 1928 Coniston massacre in the Northern Territory. Is it any wonder, then, given the frontier experience and the ongoing shame of Aboriginal deaths in custody, that so many First Nations people harbour a deep suspicion and fear of police. Non-Indigenous Australians should dwell on this as they contemplate the latest findings of the massacre map. Denial – of the collective conscience, of national misdeeds of the past – is succoured by wilful ignorance. Knowledge and understanding are the fuel of ongoing reckoning. And reckoning is at the heart of the massacre map project. Part of that reckoning is understanding that some police forces have at their genesis a purpose to “disperse” (a genteel white frontier euphemism, along with “tranquilise”) the troublesome “native” or “aborigine”. Take the New South Wales mounted police unit, established in 1825 by the then colonial governor, Thomas Brisbane, after the Bathurst wars with the Wiradjuri to further quell Aboriginal resistance. You will struggle to find mention of that in the proud NSW police writing of its history. But the state mounted police involvement in the notorious Waterloo Creek massacre of 1838 and numerous other orchestrated killings is firmly established history with a disturbing resonance for some Aboriginal people (and their defenders). The Northern Territory police has its own shameful history of acute violence against Aboriginal people that manifests in the profound contempt many NT Indigenous people have for the force. Some individual NT police – beginning with Paul Foelsche – stand out for their barbarity and for the historical stain their actions bequeathed to the NT mounted police (which evolved into the territory’s chief law enforcement agency). Today Foelsche would be called a gun-nut for his obsession with firearms, and a ghoul for his twin fetish for Aboriginal ethnology and penchant for collecting Indigenous human remains. The outback justice historian Tony Roberts wrote of Foelsche, who was in charge of the NT force from 1870 until 1904: “... the man who masterminded more massacres in the territory than anyone else was Inspector Foelsche. A former soldier he was cunning, devious and merciless with Aboriginals … Some considered him an expert on Aboriginals, not knowing that the skulls he studied were not merely collected by him.” Foelsche is celebrated in territory history as a rough, resilient pioneer. So much so that a street was named after him in Darwin. His contemporary William Willshire, a constable posted to Alice Springs in 1882, oversaw 20 years of disproportionate outback reprisal against the local Aboriginal people. He detailed some exploits in several books, not least The Land of the Dawning, which point to the psychopathy that led him to be charged with murder and, perhaps inevitably, pardoned. The settlers all but mutinied in his defence and he was not dismissed from the force. He resigned in 1908 – the first but not last territory police officer to be charged with murdering an Aboriginal person. It seems imponderable that he could write The Land of the Dawning in 1896, while still a serving police officer and while continuing to mete out extreme violence. He writes of encountering a big group of Aboriginal people at Victoria River: “... camped amongst rocks of enormous magnitude and long dry grass ... They scattered in all directions, setting fire to the grass on each side of us, throwing occasional spears, and yelling at us. It’s no use mincing matters – the Martini Henry carbines at this critical moment were talking English in the silent majesty of those great eternal rocks.” Of Indigenous women, Willshire mused: “Men would not remain so many years in a country like this if there were no women, and perhaps the Almighty meant them for use as He has placed them wherever the pioneers go … what I am speaking about is only natural, especially for men who are isolated away in the bush at out-stations where women of all ages and sizes are running at large.” Willshire has a street named in his honour in Alice Springs. Then, of course, there was George Murray – the former Anzac who became an NT constable and orchestrator of the 1928 Coniston massacre where, according to the accounts of some Indigenous witnesses, up to 170 people were killed. Murray, also revered at the time and for decades after as a heroic frontiersman, was cleared in a government inquiry. Bill McKinnon was the NT cop who murdered the Anangu man Yokununna at Uluru in 1934 and in so doing drove his people away from their home around what was for many years renamed Ayers Rock. McKinnon also lied to an official inquiry to cover his tracks, though his evil was exposed decades later, after his death, by the archive he left. This is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the territory police’s history of violence against Indigenous people. In the context of that bloody history, the tortured sensibilities and emotions of so many during and after this year’s trial of police officer Zachary Rolfe are easy to understand. A jury acquitted Rolfe of murder last Friday over the 2019 shooting of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu. The court heard that Walker was shot three times, with Rolfe arguing he had acted to protect his and his partner’s safety. There is no suggestion that the events outlined in the Rolfe trial mirror the course of massacres and murders in the 19th and early 20th century referred to above. But there is no doubt that the anguish of the Warlpiri people of Yuendumu at the verdict has its roots in that traumatic history. Not least because the 1928 massacre of Warlpiri at nearby Coniston in 1928 is still very much alive in familial memory around Yuendemu, where distrust and suspicion of police has a very long tail. Now, with the findings of the massacre map project, there is a national paradigm through which to view such simmering suspicion and distrust. First Nations people have for 200 years seen police across this continent shoot Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people – and face few, if any, consequences. After the Rolfe verdict Scott Morrison said he respected the decision of the “justice system”. But frontier history tells a different story when it comes to the police killing of Aboriginal people – and justice for those victims and their families.

3/19/2022,"It’s not often the prime minister gets taken to the NSW supreme court, especially by a member of his own party. But such is the vehemence of some NSW Liberal party members’ views towards the party’s internal preselection processes, that it has come to this. The challenge is the second legal action launched in recent weeks against the Liberal hierarchy by little-known 43-year-old businessman Matthew Camenzuli. Having already won a previous supreme court challenge last month – allowing the NSW executive to remain in place amid factional infighting – Camenzuli has now set his sights on an even bigger target. If he wins, the political future of two federal ministers plus a long-term federal MP will be in doubt. As it stands, the federal budget is less than a fortnight away, with the federal election campaign likely to start a few days later. Yet the Liberal party in NSW is without candidates in at least four winnable seats. This challenge could see another three thrown into disarray. Camenzuli’s suit names a suite of senior Liberals, including the prime minister, Scott Morrison; the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet; and the former federal president of the party, Chris McDiven, over actions taken in March. As a three-person committee appointed by the federal party, they briefly took control of the NSW branch and administratively affirmed three preselections: federal environment minister Sussan Ley in Farrer; immigration minister Alex Hawke in Mitchell; and Trent Zimmerman in North Sydney. All three had been facing challenges for preselection, with Ley under threat from conservative rightwinger Christian Ellis. All three are now also named in Camenzuli’s court action, as well as the presidents of the state and federal Liberal divisions. With the ministers’ futures supposedly secured, the remaining preselections had been set to proceed via plebiscites in late March. But just as it seemed like the long-running factional war within the NSW Liberals had reached a ceasefire, Camenzuli this week launched another legal foray. He argues that Ley, Hawke and Zimmerman were not preselected according to the Liberal party’s constitution, and the federal executive acted beyond its powers by appointing the three-person committee of Morrison, Perrottet and McDiven. Camenzuli, a member of the NSW state executive, is either standing on principle or he smells a double-cross coming on the remaining preselections. A businessman from Parramatta, Camenzuli is the son of migrants. He founded an IT company in a garage in Greystanes that has grown into a multimillion dollar enterprise that provides software systems for residential property developers to help manage jobs. Critics within the party point out that Camenzuli’s case could indirectly benefit his cousin Charles Camenzuli’s political ambitions. Charles Camenzuli is the likely frontrunner for the seat of Parramatta if the promised plebiscite occurs, but no outcome is certain. Others say the action is proof of Matthew Camenzuli’s own desire to be in the limelight However, Matthew Camenzuli vehemently denies both suggestions. While he himself is not permitted by Liberal party rules to talk publicly, confidantes say his motivation is simple: he’s truly committed to seeing grassroots democracy take hold in the NSW Liberal party. The 43-year-old is one of a relatively small group on the state executive that has been insisting that new democratic processes introduced to the constitution of the NSW Liberal party in 2018 – and being used for the first time in 2022 – be followed. The group has resisted several proposals devised by factional leaders to carve up seats administratively and has used a rule that requires a 90% vote to use special powers to effectively stymie these deals. “The prime minister just doesn’t understand that what’s at stake here is the very heart and soul of the Liberal party, and giving members a say,” said one friend. Friends of Camenzuli say he was motivated to join the party 15 years ago because he believed the Liberals best represented small business, freedom and democracy. He and Charles Camenzuli became active in the Parramatta branch and the conservative right faction. While Charles decided to run as a candidate – he represented the Liberals in Parramatta in 2019 and is one of several people seeking preselection this time around – Matthew has involved himself in behind-the-scenes politics. He became a member of the party’s NSW state council, which represents the branches, and was elected as one of the “urban representatives” on the state executive, which effectively functions like the division’s board. In 2017 Camenzuli and other like-minded conservatives, including former prime minister Tony Abbott, were behind the so called Warringah motion that called for rule changes to give ordinary members a bigger voice in choosing candidates. The right was particularly supportive of the rule changes because they believe that the moderates have too much control over the NSW machine, while they, in fact, have a bigger base among the grassroots. But other factions opposed it, warning plebiscites could lead to outbreaks of branch stacking and destabilise the party. The 2017 Warringah proposal was modified before being adopted in 2018 so that branches got a 75% say and state executive was allocated 25% of the votes. State executive could still take over preselections but the party put in safeguards that required 90% support from state executive before special powers could be used. The 2022 federal election preselections are the first major use of the Warringah rules and the result has not been pretty. What started as an embarrassing impasse has now become a crisis. Although aligned with the right faction, Camenzuli has made it clear he has no time for the factional power brokers within the party and wants to see their power curtailed. “He puts his money where his mouth is,” said one confidante. “He doesn’t care about spending a million on legal fees, if that’s what it takes.” Camenzuli’s case is currently not due to be dealt with until April, which would make it impossible to resolve before the May election. A request for an urgent hearing is being considered. It’s possible that the remaining plebiscites will proceed and the court action will be discontinued. Or it’s possible that this will trigger a wholesale takeover by the federal division when they meet next Friday. Predicting what will happen in the NSW Liberal party has become nigh on impossible, even for those inside the tent.",News/Australia news,Who is Matthew Camenzuli?

3/19/2022,"Des Grace and his 15-year-old daughter, Rahleigha, thought they were hearing the death cries of two of their dogs, Big Boy and Rex. They had been sitting on the kitchen bench of their house in Lismore when the water came up so fast that they decided to get out at 3.30am. One of their dogs, Ripper, followed them, but Big Boy and Rex were too scared to go through the water to the front door. Des and Rahleigha would spend the next eight hours in kayaks tied to the house before climbing up a tree on to the roof. They could hear the two dogs banging their heads against the ceiling before father and daughter were rescued by a police boat. “It was very upsetting,” Des says. “Dad tried to rip the roof sheet off to get them through, but he’s actually just had surgery – like a mastectomy – so he has no muscle in one side,” says his other daughter, Annanekah. The water had come right up to the roof of the house and they thought the dogs had perished. “But they got up into the loft in the roof cavity – obviously there was enough room for them,” Annanekah says. “They were there for two days before we could get someone to rescue them.” Rex and Big Boy, now in foster care until their homeless family can take them back, are among countless animals displaced by the flood. Staffie Big Boy – who had never had separation issues before – now won’t let his foster carer out of his sight. Derek Knox, from the Animal Rescue Cooperative (ARC), says difficult decisions were made during the floods. “When the floods hit, people had to make insane choices of what to save and even which animals they could save,” Knox says. “It is an area with a lot of animals, and people were rescued from roof cavities with animals crying from the roof.” From the beginning, Kate Morris, from the charity Willow Tree Sanctuary, was on the ground. “The moment the roads opened, we were handing out donations to people on the ground and to the choppers and helping with our own search and rescue efforts,” she says. “We heard many harrowing stories of animals in trouble and sent out our volunteers and staff wherever we could,” Morris says. “We helped dogs trapped in houses, rescued cats living in tents with their owners, and helped farm animals that had been swept up in the flood waters. “We had a call from a woman who had seen a horse in Bungawalbin standing in rising flood waters with just its nose above water. We took a call to help two great danes stranded on a roof that couldn’t fit in the rescue boat. We saved 10 cats from a flooded house in Coraki. We took a call from a flooded vet clinic about a cow stuck in River Street, Ballina.” Morris says there is “a sea of displaced animals that have been showing up in the flood-affected areas”. “In the early days of the floods, local vets started reaching out to us as the lost and displaced animals started flowing into their clinics as strays.” Knox says vets have dealt with “pet animals ranging from large pythons to goats, chickens to cats and dogs”. People already traumatised by losing everything are being further traumatised by having to give up pets to go into temporary housing which cannot take animals. The lack of pet-friendly accommodation “really compounds the stress and trauma”, says Sali Bracewell of ARC. Knox says: “There is nowhere safe for animals to stay … They have no place to go.” People are choosing to live in their cars rather than give up the only thing they have left: the animals they love. One couple in touch with Knox are living with four dogs and three kids in a cabin without power or water. For five nights, Chris Trew and his wife slept in cars with two children, three dogs, two cats and a snake. “My wife has got a car and [my] son has bought a car. We sort of shared the dogs. My son would have the two dogs one night and the next night I’d have the two dogs. They are up all night, barking and carrying on.” The snake had lost its enclosure, Trew says. “We had to handle him quite a bit because you have got to try and keep it warm, so you just keep it on your body, he wraps around your neck.” The snake is now at a vet until they can get another enclosure. Others are going back into uninhabitable houses rather than surrendering a pet. Morris talks of the help provided by Willow Tree Sanctuary to a man named Doug. “One of Doug’s beloved dogs died in the floods and his other 14-year-old dog was taken to the local pound, terrified and deeply traumatised,” Morris says. “The pound thought the dog was deaf and blind because it had shut down so much. Doug left the evacuation centre so he could bring his dog home, despite their house still being filthy.” Other animals have not been so lucky. “We have seen a massive spike in the number of animals that have been surrendered over the past two weeks as the enormity of rebuilding lives with pets in tow becomes too overwhelming for some people,” Morris says. “Many more animals, both lost and surrendered pets, are ending up in local pounds and pushing them to capacity. “It is incredibly distressing, and we are doing our very best to get as many out as possible, but this is sadly an ongoing problem writ large by these disastrous floods.” At the frontline and in addition to supplying food, medical and support, Willow Tree Sanctuary and ARC are finding foster carers to look after displaced animals until they can be with their people again. Knox says they are starting to get “a flood of people offering to help and a flood of people saying, ‘I need your help’”. “Over 150 people have offered space in their homes so far and that number increases every day.” Sarah McKenzie, from Northern Rivers Animal Services, has taken nine dogs and four cats from Cabbage Tree Island, an Aboriginal mission that was completely flooded. They have all lost their homes. She says she is aiming to get the animals into “emergency foster care homes that can take care of them, where it’s a bit nicer for them than being at the shelter”. “Given that it’s going to be a protracted thing, we just don’t know how long it’s going to be. They absolutely love their pets on Cabbage Tree Island. They’re really upset to have to leave them here. “There are a lot of generous people in the community that have offered to open up their homes and care for these pets until the owners are able to take them back. So yeah, it’s awful for everyone.”",News/Australia news,"Snakes in cars, dogs on roofs: the battle to save animals stranded in the NSW floods",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/snakes-in-cars-dogs-on-roofs-the-battle-to-save-animals-stranded-in-the-nsw-floods
3/19/2022,"Practically every Australian has a favourite line from The Castle. For some it is the serenity of Bonnie Doon, the daggy dad kitchen conversation (“what do you call that, darl?”) or the jousting sticks for sale on Trading Post (“tell him he’s dreamin’!”). For others, it is the classic exclamation: “This is going straight to the pool room!” That Castle-speak remains pervasive today is just one indicator of the 1997 film’s enduring cultural resonance. The relatively low-budget local production has become one of the most beloved Australian movies of all time. Next month, the film will celebrate its 25th anniversary. “When we first did a sit-down read, it was just a funny, lovely, humble, charming little film,” Tiriel Mora, who played suburban solicitor Dennis Denuto, tells Guardian Australia. “But very much a little film. We shot it in 10-and-a-half days, and that included a half day in Canberra for the high court stuff. We couldn’t possibly know that it would resonate like it did.” But resonate it has, at the time and ever since. “It just grew and grew and grew,” he adds. The Castle tells the story of the Kerrigan family’s battle to save their suburban Melbourne home, their castle, from compulsory acquisition as the airport bordering the property seeks to expand. Father Darryl Kerrigan persuades local solicitor Denuto (more familiar with defending petty criminals – including Kerrigan’s son – than the constitution) to challenge the acquisition. After Denuto loses the case, retired barrister Lawrence Hammill QC (played by Bud Tingwell) offers to appeal pro bono to the high court. Against all odds, they win. For some, the most well-known and consequential of the numerous catchphrases of the film comes from the courtroom scene where Denuto flails haplessly for a legal authority to support his client’s case. “It’s the constitution, it’s Mabo, it’s justice, it’s law, it’s the vibe,” says Denuto. “It is rare that popular culture and the high court intersect,” says George Williams, a law professor at the University of New South Wales. “Never have they done so more spectacularly than with The Castle. The movie places the high court at the centre of a David and Goliath battle that taps into deeply held Australian values around fairness and home.” Williams says that under the real law of section 51(xxxi) of the constitution (which prohibits the federal government compulsorily acquiring land other than “on just terms”), the Kerrigans would have lost. The opposite outcome however, he says, made for a better storyline. One reason for the film’s cult status is that its producers, Working Dog, have left The Castle to a life of its own. They have largely refused to speak publicly about the film; executive producer Michael Hirsh declined an interview request from Guardian Australia. In an interview last year with Radio New Zealand while promoting the TV series Utopia, Hirsh’s Working Dog colleague Rob Sitch said, “I think in some ways the smartest thing we did was stay out of the way. It’s been a gift that keeps on giving for us.” The movie is often repeated on Channel Nine and is available to stream on Stan. “What is so refreshing about The Castle is its profound Australianness,” says William MacNeil, an honorary professor at the University of Queensland and leading expert on law and culture. MacNeil says the film corrected the cultural cringe that had previously seen Australian audiences more familiar with US or British legal dramas. “Indeed, Denuto makes so much of its ‘vibe’ that the Australian constitution – hitherto unknown in terms of its dramatic possibilities – practically becomes a leading character in the film.” In turn, the amorphous “vibe” has permeated the typically rarefied language of the legal world. The concept has found its way into many legal arguments, including in numerous hearings before the high court. Denuto’s famous submission was quoted in a NSW court judgment in 2010, while a Queensland lawyer sued for $250,000 in defamation damages after being described as “Dennis Denuto from Ipswich” (he lost). Such is the movie’s resonance within the law that it was the only film to gain an entry in the Oxford Companion to the High Court of Australia. In a rare break from his silence around the film, the entry was written by Sitch, who directed and co-wrote The Castle. “It is a sweeping saga that takes the harsh Australian outback, the rugged characters of the Anzac legend, the spirit of Banjo Paterson and ignores them in favour of a greyhound-racing tow truck driver who never meant to be a hero,” he jests. In the written entry, Sitch also takes aim at the high court authorities, who refused to permit filming inside the brutalist court building in Canberra. Instead, the courtroom scenes were filmed in Melbourne, before a quick trip to Canberra to film outside the high court. Mora recalls the filming was done on a freezing Canberra Saturday, with local journalists press-ganged into being extras. “That added authenticity,” he chuckles. But The Castle, released five years after the high court’s landmark decision in Mabo, also contained a more serious message. “The film was not just brilliant entertainment,” says Emeritus Professor Tony Blackshield from Macquarie Law School. “Its real social function was to communicate a deeper social understanding of the importance of Mabo.” Blackshield suggests that the scene where Darryl Kerrigan exclaims that his predicament has helped him understand how Indigenous Australians feel about dispossession “is the central point of the film”. (In another scene, Denuto somewhat mischaracterises Mabo in a legal argument: “That’s your classic case of big business trying to take land … and they couldn’t.”) The movie was released at a time of increasingly fractious national discourse, after Mabo and the Native Title Act had recognised that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities had legal rights to land. “The film becomes this wonderful intervention, that flips this idea of home and country and land into a language that becomes identifiable [to mainstream Australian audiences],” says Professor Kieran Tranter, chair of law, technology and future at Queensland University of Technology. At a time when rightwing politicians and newspapers were arguing against native title, The Castle “sold a story to a nervous nation that was quite reassuring”, says Tranter. Mora suggests The Castle’s political message was “pointed and yet subtle” (although he acknowledges, laughing, “that doesn’t make sense”). “The very powerful underlying theme of the film is about justice, and that’s justice for all, not just for some people,” continues the actor. By using an ordinary suburban family as the vehicle, Mora suggests, it made “bigger questions of injustice to first Australians more approachable”. These remain live political issues (including before the high court). “[The Castle] touched on a very significant conversation that we are still having,” Mora adds. Whether it would be considered appropriate today to make a film indirectly addressing Indigenous issues with a largely white cast is questionable. “There are a lot of problems talking about [Indigenous] stories without having [Indigenous] representation,” admits Tranter. Asmi Wood, a Torres Strait Islander and professor at the Australian National University College of Law, says The Castle has withstood the test of time. An expert on Indigenous legal issues, Wood often discusses the film with first-year law students and is full of praise for its subtle political message. “To make people understand that there is another group of people who might feel alienated, for different reasons and different circumstances, but to create that level of empathy, I think the film is absolutely brilliant,” he says. But for all The Castle’s cultural commentary, legal legacy and political purpose, it remains popular because it guarantees a laugh. “I think it was very funny,” says Wood.",Arts/Film,"‘It’s the vibe’: 25 years on, how The Castle became an Australian classic",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/19/its-the-vibe-25-years-on-how-the-castle-became-an-australian-classic
3/19/2022,"Julie-Marie Hay didn’t always struggle on her nurse’s salary – even as a single parent and the primary carer of her three children. “I used to be able to afford what we needed when we needed it, and only struggled on the odd occasion when something big came in. Even a couple of years ago,” Hay says. Hay, 41, is an enrolled nurse and works full-time in Perth. Her fortnightly take-home pay comes in at just under $2,000. She receives small stipends from the family tax benefit and carer’s allowance from Centrelink, and occasional child support payments. And it’s not enough to keep the family’s heads above water. “I’d say I’m shorter each fortnight by about $300 in the last year alone,” Hay says. “I don’t have any debt at all. I don’t have any loans. Even that’s not enough for me to survive. If I had a loan, I would drown.” Hay is far from alone in her fears. With a federal election imminent, the rapidly rising cost of living is shaping up to be a hot-button issue. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Monday that the government was “very aware” of the strain on household budgets. “These cost of living impacts are real, and the Australian government understands that,” Morrison said. The federal government’s current solution to the issue of astronomical rises in the cost of living is to propose tax cuts. But the opposition says it is a matter of raw income. “Families are under massive pressure – everything is going up except people’s wages,” the federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said this week. In a speech to the Australia Institute on Tuesday, Australian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O’Neil said that in 2021, workers earning the average income of $68,000 effectively had a pay cut of $832, as price increases outstripped the minor raises negotiated in enterprise bargaining. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, consumer prices rose 3.5% and wages just 2.3% last year. Hay says she does her best to provide everything her family needs, juggling costs fortnight by fortnight, but it’s what she has to go without that is the most telling. Hay’s children, aged seven, 11 and 16, all have attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). One of them is also autistic. They require regular visits to a paediatrician (around $600 every six months), medication (approximately $220 a month) and GP visits in between for supplementary scripts. They are inflexible about what they will and won’t eat, so budgeting opportunities in the weekly grocery shop are limited. So Hay restricts her own food “so I don’t have the excess costs”. She taught herself to service her own car so she could save on routine maintenance. She had to access her superannuation so she could pay for dental work. She borrowed money from a colleague to pay for Christmas presents. And although she was diagnosed with ADHD too, she hasn’t yet been able to seek treatment for herself. “I couldn’t follow up on it because I couldn’t afford it,” she says. Hay’s small Mazda3, which she needs to drive to work each day, used to cost around $60 to fill. Now it costs more like $80 or $90. And then there’s rent, which has “skyrocketed” in Perth. Hay’s rose $60 per week last April and she is terrified it will rise again next month. “I don’t have any savings, so if they say to me ‘you’re out’, then I’m stuck.” Hay is concerned that even the relatively ambitious pay rises on her industry’s agenda are unlikely to make a dent on her day-to-day life. “We’re asking for 4% in this next raise, and even that scares me because I don’t think that’s going to cover what I require to be able to survive. And if they push my rent up, then it’s not going to cover anything.” “The wage system in this country is broken,” says Tim Kennedy, national secretary for the United Workers Union. “This is not by accident; it is by design.” The economic crisis caused by the pandemic exacerbated already existing inequalities in Australia, Kennedy says. “Unless Australian workers are given the capacity to obtain a fair share in wages, then more people will fall back into unnecessary poverty.” It’s not just wages that aren’t keeping up with the cost of living. If even those on a full-time income are struggling, things are even tougher for people who need to rely on government support payments. Desanka Ogrizovic, 36, supports her 12-year-old daughter and herself on jobseeker payments. Having worked as both a counsellor and in the beauty industry, she has been looking for jobs and trying to build her own business, but has struggled to land work. Ogrizovic is luckier than some: she and her daughter have been able to live rent-free in her grandmother’s apartment since her grandmother moved into aged care. It cuts out one of the biggest cost burdens – at least for now. But it’s not a permanent solution, especially as she knows that there is literally no housing in the cities that is affordable for people on jobseeker payments. “It’s not an easy situation,” Ogrizovic says. “I know married couples that live together also struggle but I feel like it’s harder when you’re just one parent. “Sometimes I’m left with $5 by the end of the fortnight. My daughter knows how hard we budget. I don’t try to bombard her with that stuff but you can see that she can see how little I have.” Jobseeker payments are scheduled to rise on 20 March – by $13.20, taking the base rate to $629.50 per fortnight. The change, a routine indexing increase, was described in a media release from Senator Anne Ruston, the minister for families and social services, as “a boost” that would “help [people] keep up with the changes in the cost of living”. The sting feels particularly sharp, coming two years after the federal government doubled those same payments as the Covid-19 pandemic hit, and then halved them again a year ago. Cassandra Goldie, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services (Acoss) has condemned the decision to cut back the rate to pre-pandemic levels as “shameful”. “It is a scandal and international disgrace that despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Australia is back to having one of the lowest rates of unemployment payment in the OECD,” Goldie says. “We know from personal testimonies and surveys that the majority of people on these very low income support payments will struggle even more to feed their families and keep a roof over their head. “They sink into debt because they can’t pay their energy bills, keep a car on the road or meet unexpected costs for appliances or computers. We are facing a homelessness and housing affordability crisis as more people struggle to pay increasing rents.” Hay says she feels like the struggles of ordinary people aren’t being heard by those in power. “I think the government needs to listen to the people who are actually working on the ground, doing all the essential things that are keeping [the country] going. “I’m on the frontline trying to help keep our city and our country and people safe and alive. And we’re getting no recognition for that. None at all. It’s almost like they’re saying, we’re going to penalise you for doing that, that’s how it feels.”",News/Australia news,How Australia’s skyrocketing cost of living is pushing people into poverty,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/how-australias-skyrocketing-cost-of-living-is-pushing-people-into-poverty
3/19/2022,"In early 1924, when work began on arguably this country’s most defining built structure, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Australia was torn between self-identifying as a loyal outpost of empire and one of the globe’s most innovative new democracies. The bridge, for all its ambition, was always going to signify – in the political, cultural and (white) Australian social sensibility of the day – more than a mere “proud arch” linking the topographically close but practically remote north shore at Milsons Point to Dawes Point in the south. In just 23 years of federation, Australia had become a template for global social progress, with women’s suffrage, workers’ protections, social security and high living standards – albeit at the expense of the dispossessed, near-eradicated First Nations peoples. When it opened nine decades ago on Saturday, the bridge – with its distinctive bow constructed of 40,000 tonnes of steel and six million rivets – stood as a breathtaking sculptural testimony to Australian (and harbour city) exceptionalism. “The bridge was an early and very powerful symbol of the modern Australian project,” says the Sydney-based urban historian Paul Ashton. “It ties in with the idea of ‘Australia unlimited’ – where there were no limits to what a young nation could aim to do if its natural and human resources were harnessed to the full capacity using the latest engineering technology.” Great Britain, apparently, viewed it differently. The “coat hanger” was built under the direction of the visionary Australian public works engineer John Bradfield (responsible for much of Sydney’s urban transport infrastructure), but was designed by the British firm Dorman Long of Middlesborough, and based on that company’s own Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne. Most of the steel for the bridge was smelted in England and then shipped in pre-formed sections to Australia, though some of the steel was sourced from Newcastle. When somewhere between 300,000 and a million people turned out for the opening, they did so under two giant flags – the Union Jack and the Australian ensign – snapping symbiotically atop construction cranes. The neophyte nation was finding its stride alright, but for Great Britain the bridge signified this was all still very much part of the colonial project. “In the orgy of self-congratulation that accompanied the opening ... much was made of this bond [between Australia and empire], with most of the British press hailing the bridge as a triumph of British engineering’,” writes Peter Spearritt in his “biography” of the bridge, The Sydney Harbour Bridge – A Life, released for its 50th anniversary. “That Australians had thought up the idea, raised the loan funds, [£6.25m, finally fully repaid through tolls in 1988] manufactured much of the materials and physically erected the structure was all too readily forgotten, though at that time many Australians still thought of themselves as British, even if they had been born here.” Ashton points out the bridge also embodied a profound symbolism in still extant parochial tensions between Sydney and Melbourne, which, due to the political chicanery surrounding colonial federation negotiations, served as the interim national capital until 1927 when federal parliament opened in Canberra. “Even then I think there was this sense in Sydney of, ‘Well, yes, you’ve got the Yarra and the federal parliament – but just look what we are going to have’,” Ashton says. These intercity tensions highlight another truth about the new nation from early federation. Despite many of its early 20th-century writers and journalists – not least the “bush bards” Henry Lawson and AB “Banjo” Paterson – depicting a mythical Australia of rugged, egalitarian frontiersman, by the time the bridge was under construction Australia was already one of the most urbanised countries in the world. Sydney was its exemplar. As the great steel arches inched towards closure, 134m over the harbour, the new bridge was celebrated as a monolithic testimony to that white urban modernity and growth. Instructively, after the 1930 census when the city’s population reached 1.23 million, Sydney regarded itself as the “second white city of empire” after surpassing Glasgow. As the unjoined spans stretched across the harbour, the emerging bridge was an everyday fascination for Sydney residents. The newspapers were captivated by its engineering intrigues, publishing daily articles during construction. Spearritt writes how “the construction of the arches was so much more spectacular than anything that had gone before that press, amateur and professional photographers competed in an unceasing photographic orgy of attempting to shoot the bridge from a new angle or in a new light”. The bridge, it was reported, “rises and falls and expands and contracts with the effects of the temperature, without, of course, impairing the stability or safety ... With an increase of degrees ... the crown, or centre, of the arch will rise or lift about seven inches, with a proportionate and, of course, lessening rise at the other portions of the arch towards either end of the bridge.” Its capacity for climatically-responsive contraction and expansion was tested on the very day – 19 August 1930 – the arches met. As the evening cooled there was a slight contraction and reopening. The gap was finally, permanently, closed at 10pm. There was every sense that this landmark would stand for an effective eternity – like the Pyramids or the Colosseum or the oldest English bridges. “Those designing and building the bridge have had to have regard for the most minute details, and for the fact that they are responsible for a structure, not of a day, but for all time.” It is a global landmark – an architectural/engineering wonder that crowns the harbour. Every New Year’s Eve it lights up with a firework display that is televised globally – a first talisman of the new year for many in the northern hemisphere. Novelists, poets, journalists, photographers and visual artists – notably Grace Cossington Smith – were similarly inspired and captivated by what they embraced as an iconic testimony to 20th century Australian progress (the use of “iconic” is cautioned against in the Guardian style guide, except in the most exceptional circumstances – of which this is surely one). Perhaps the most extraordinary literary testimony to the bridge was the self-published, decidedly esoteric 534-page Parables of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, written in 1930 by the Rev Frank Cash, rector of Christ church in Lavender Bay. He was fascinated with every element of the demolition works and subsequent construction taking place outside his windows. However, he seemed barely cognisant of the human cost (16 lives were lost in construction) and the countless businesses closed and many poor rendered homeless for the leviathan. This attitude, Ashton says, was pervasive, as “the bridge profoundly demonstrated how naturalised the ideology of progress had become in Australian society”. He says: “A delegation of workers made a case [to government] for the working-class families whose homes were going to be demolished to make way for the ‘coat hanger’ ... their petition said that they knew that they could not stand ‘in the way of progress’ and simply wanted to be re-housed.” But, Spearritt points out, there was no state housing authority to help and politics impeded any effective rehousing assistance – Jack Lang’s Labor government lost power in 1927, and after reelection in 1930 the New South Wales governor sacked his administration soon after the bridge opened in 1932. As Delia Falconer writes in her seminal book, Sydney, great swathes of Millers Point and The Rocks were levelled. “So intent was the city on achieving this feat of engineering that it used a strong arm to evict struggling residents from their many terraces and shops; few received compensation or support, and some heartbreaking letters remain in the archives from people pleading for a few pounds’ assistance.” It should also be acknowledged that the bridge and the harbour city it and its twin, the Opera House, architecturally define are imposed on the lands and waters of the Eora custodians, who, by the time the demolitions began, had been thoroughly dispossessed and decimated by violence and disease. When the First Fleet anchored in the harbour in 1788, the shore was dotted with towers of shell, some 12m high – monumental middens proudly bolstered over countless generations, testimony to 60-plus millennia of Indigenous continental civilisation. The colonists quickly burnt them all for building lime. So, not everyone will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the bridge’s eventful opening – when the antique dealer, former soldier, staunch royalist and member of the proto-fascist New Guard Francis De Groot inveigled his way into the vice regal party on horseback and cut the ribbon with his sabre, ahead of Lang, thereby guaranteeing himself an eccentric posterity. Suburban streets emptied as Sydneysiders poured into the city to traverse the bridge, which would not be open solely to pedestrians again until the 50th anniversary in 1982. In 2000, the bridge was once again closed to traffic as 250,000 people took part in the people’s walk for Aboriginal reconciliation. It was an optimistic moment on a stunning clear morning, in the most photogenic city of a modern nation at the beginning of a new millennium. Twenty-two years later, reconciliation’s progress is slow; the Aboriginal flag has been permanently flown from the bridge’s apex since last month. “Eternity”, the fireworks on the bridge spelled out at midnight on 1 January 2000 – a tribute to another Sydney eccentric, Arthur Stace, taken to chalking the evocative forevermore word on footpaths across the burgeoning city. An eternity for a modern marvel forever reaching across the harbour, perhaps – but always steeped in the bedrock of a land with a timeless human past.",News/Australia news,A bridge to empire – and beyond: Sydney’s ‘coat hanger’ turns 90,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/18/a-bridge-to-empire-and-beyond-sydneys-coat-hanger-turns-90
3/19/2022,"It was a classic Peter Dutton outing. The defence minister used a speech this week to warn that “ominous clouds are forming” in the Indo-Pacific, that China and Russia’s “unholy alliance” should ring alarm bells, and that countries in the region must confront the “mounting threats to regional stability”. Dutton then turned his attention to threats closer to home: specifically Labor, his electoral enemy, based on a simplistic extrapolation of its previous record in defence. “When we came in to government [defence] spending was at 1.56% of GDP – the lowest level since 1938,” he told a United States Studies Centre event in Canberra. “Had spending continued on that trajectory we would have had $55bn less in aggregate spent in defence and on acquisition over the course of the last several years, and we would be facing a budget today with a three in front of it instead of a four. This year we spent $41bn.” It’s a taste of what voters are likely to hear during the election campaign as the Coalition seeks to make national security a central issue, with Scott Morrison repeatedly declaring that we are living in uncertain times and now is not the time to change captains. But experts say there is largely bipartisanship on major defence issues, including on ramping up spending levels, recruiting more ADF personnel and implementing the much-trumpeted Aukus pact with the US and the UK – even as the nuclear-powered submarines plan is yet to be bedded down. In one sense, the Coalition’s attempt to cast backwards is a marker of how the parties are largely united on the major strategic settings that they believe are suited to the current security environment. But Dutton’s defence spending tale describes a parallel universe that doesn’t exist. He’s taken a single-year percentage and added up the total gap in spending in the unlikely scenario that the rate had remained at that historical low for every year between then and now. Dennis Richardson, a longtime public servant who has worked under both sides of politics, started as defence secretary a few months after the Gillard government’s 2012 budget outlined plans to cut about $5.5bn from the defence portfolio, spread over four years, including by deferring some acquisitions and reducing the civilian workforce. That was a time when Labor remained under significant political pressure to deliver promised budget surpluses, and months before Xi Jinping took power in Beijing. (Two years later, Tony Abbott invited China’s president to address the Australian parliament and feted him at a state dinner.) “That sole budget is not the reason why we have a problem now, quite obviously,” Richardson says. He notes that the Gillard government published a new defence white paper in 2013 that “did commit the Labor government to increasing the defence budget to 2% of GDP”. “In other words, the Labor government learned from the criticism it legitimately got following [that] budget.” According to an analysis of official data compiled by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, annual defence spending as a share of the economy hovered between 1.7% and 1.8% of GDP during the life of the Howard government. Under the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments, it hit a peak of 1.96% in 2009-10 and a low of 1.59% in 2012-13. Under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments it has steadily risen to be about 2% now – and will continue to increase. Prof Peter Dean, the director of the University of Western Australia’s defence and security institute, says defence spending “is and will continue to be a big battleground” in the election even though both parties have a commitment to 2% or above. He notes how the same figures can be interpreted multiple ways. “The Coalition is right that defence spending under Labor fell to the lowest point of GDP since 1938 – if you want to compare defence spending to the monetary value of final goods and services in the economy,” Dean says. “If, however, you want to look at government spending on defence as a percentage of the [overall] budget, Labor spent more in their last two years in office than the Coalition has in 2021-2022. Nine years on from 2013, though, both the budget and the economy are much larger, as is overall defence spending.” Increased defence spending is one thing. What it actually delivers is another. Dean says Aukus “will be difficult for no matter who wins government” and “will require closer cooperation with the US in a period of increased risk”. Regardless of who forms government, leaders will face post-election decisions about how the nuclear-propelled submarines are actually built and delivered, which remains subject to a study conducted jointly with the US and the UK. Dean published a paper this week describing the Aukus announcement six months ago as “the moment the Australian government came to terms with the repercussions of a more assertive China, a more multipolar global order and changing US power”. But he argues the broader security cooperation aspects of Aukus “are far more important than Australia’s shift to nuclear-powered submarines”. “The benefits of Aukus in the near term will be found in other areas such as long range missile collaboration and science and technology,” he says. While Labor has attempted to dismiss any suggestion of a divide on Aukus or on the major national security threats, it has also sought to chip away at any perceived Coalition political advantage on the issue. Labor says it is entitled to question the Coalition’s record on major acquisitions, including the new frigates and the handling of the now-dumped French submarine contract. “We are facing times of global instability, particularly growing tensions within our region,” Brendan O’Connor, the shadow defence minister, told the same US Studies Centre event that Dutton addressed this week. “And though we share concerns on these matters, we have an obligation to question the gap between what the government says and what the government delivers.” Chief among Labor’s concerns is the so-called “capability gap” between now and when the first of the new nuclear-propelled submarines are ready in the late 2030s. The government has committed to major work to extend the life of the existing conventionally powered Collins class submarines. Labor says, if elected, it would take advice on what can be done to bridge the gap, including considering fitting tomahawk missiles to the existing submarines and assessing what strike capabilities could be accelerated or strengthened in the near term. It has also committed to ensuring all defence contracts “have measurable and enforceable levels of local content”. On the whole, these may seem to be minor differences and tentative commitments. But it would be wrong to say there is no difference between the major parties on approaches to national security. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has sought to elevate recognition of the climate crisis as a key national security threat. He said he would order the head of national intelligence and the secretary of defence to undertake a climate-driven security risk assessment within four months of coming to government. One option is to set up a new Office of Climate Threat Intelligence. And, in the wake of severe flooding in northern NSW and south-east Queensland, Labor would consider the need for a new national emergency taskforce. Albanese argues a stronger climate policy – including a more ambitious 2030 target – would give Australia more credibility in its relations with Pacific nations. Dean observes: “Morrison has issues inside his own party with this and chose not to make the link to national security while visiting flood areas. Albanese has no such problem with this – meaning Labor is more aligned with the US than the government on this, given the Biden administration’s work on climate and security.” When it comes to the relationship with China, however, both major parties now see the differences as largely structural, and not something that can enjoy a simple “reset” merely by a change in tone. This week Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, met with the new Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, a week after the minister, Marise Payne did so. Wong made largely the same points as Payne (on human rights, detained Australians, and free trade) and affirmed that those positions were bipartisan. Wong also “expressed her serious concerns over reports that Russia has asked China for weapons” and urged Beijing to reject the request. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After being rebuked by current and former national security officials, the Morrison government appears to have stepped back from last month’s heightened rhetoric about Albanese being the Chinese Communist party’s choice in the forthcoming election. That doesn’t mean the Coalition’s warnings against “appeasing” China won’t return as polling day approaches, but it is far from clear whether that line of attack has resonated with voters. “It’s legitimate for there to be differences on national security in a liberal democracy. There always have been,” Richardson told the National Press Club this week. “There were differences over the Vietnam war. There were differences over the Iraq War.” Richardson said he had spoken up because he objected to the government’s attempt “to create the perception of a difference on China where, in fact, there was none” – something he saw as contrary to Australia’s national interests. “Beyond that, however, I hope there is debate, an active debate on matters of national security,” Richardson said. “That’s as it should be in a liberal democracy. That doesn’t weaken us. I suspect [Vladimir] Putin would be in a better position today if there was a bit more debate and questioning within his own system.”",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton casts Coalition as stronger than Labor on defence as election nears – so how different are they?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/19/peter-dutton-casts-coalition-as-stronger-than-labor-on-defence-as-election-nears-so-how-different-are-they
3/19/2022,"The truck convoy that paralyzed much of downtown Ottawa for nearly a month cost the city more than C$36m, officials have said, and the figure is expected to rise in the coming weeks. A memo released by the city on Friday said policing costs accounted for the vast majority of the $36.3m bill. The so-called ‘Freedom Convoy’ arrived in the Canadian capital at the end of January, initially a protest over Covid-19 vaccine mandates, but eventually turning into a broader demonstration against the incumbent government, with calls to overthrow the prime minister. In mid-February, after the federal government invoked emergency legislation, hundreds of police dismantled the barricades and arrested nearly 200 people, including influential figures in the protest and convoy organizers. In a breakdown of the costs associated with the occupation, the city said it paid out $27.7m to police officers for wages, accommodation for police from out of town, vehicle expenses and food. Costs for bringing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to aid in dismantling the protests were not included in the $27m figure. Ottawa is expected to ask the federal government to reimburse the city for “all costs associated with the response”, city manager Steve Kanellakos told councillors Friday. The figure probably does not reflect the broader economic damage to the city. Local businesses in the downtown area were forced to shut down for weeks and city infrastructure will also need repairs. The $36m is more than double what the city earmarked for affordable and supportive housing in the most recent budget. In addition to a stiff economic cost, the convoy has already exacted widespread political damage in the city, deepening rifts and leading to raucous council meetings. Midway through the protests, police chief Peter Sloly resigned amid mounting criticism that he and his team had let the protests get out of hand. “This city is in chaos and it doesn’t need to be,” councillor Anne Meehan said before abruptly resigning from the police services board. All other board members also resigned in the days that followed, except for board chair councillor Diane Deans, who was removed by a council vote.",News/World news,Ottawa truck convoy cost the city more than C$36m – mainly in police expenses,https://www.theguardian.com/discover-cool-canada/2022/mar/18/ottawa-truck-convey-cost-c36m-police
3/19/2022,"Consumers will no longer be able to buy free-range eggs in the UK from Monday, with birds not having been allowed outdoors since November due to fears of avian flu outbreaks. Eggs sold in shops will have to carry a sticker or label saying they are in fact “barn eggs”, the name given to eggs produced by hens permanently housed indoors. The UK was hit by what government officials have said is the “largest ever outbreak of avian flu” this winter, with more than 80 reported outbreaks in England. As a result, birds reared for meat and eggs have been ordered by the UK government to be kept indoors since November to reduce the risk of outbreaks. The length of time they have been kept indoors means their eggs can now no longer be labelled free-range. The rules apply to all birds, whether produced by one hen in a garden or a large-scale poultry business. Farmers had hoped the government would lift the housing order next week, but after new avian flu outbreaks in the past week, officials have decide to keep the order in place. Suffolk-based egg producer Daniel Brown, who keeps more than 40,000 free-range hens, said his birds had coped well indoors so far. “We’ve given them extra things in the shed like hay and grit to give them things to peck at and keep them amused.” Brown said avian flu outbreaks usually drop off as the weather warms, so he hopes the latest housing order will be lifted soon. “A chicken won’t be bothered about not going outside in December and January, but when it’s nice in May they’ll want to be out late into the evening,” he said. The UK has not been alone in being affected by avian flu outbreaks this year, with continental Europe suffering one its worst winters for the disease too. France has been trialling avian influenza vaccines, but the solution has been complicated by the numerous strains of bird flu and the bans some countries have on importing poultry meat from countries that vaccinate birds. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “The 16-week grace period we allowed for free-range eggs has now been exceeded, and eggs must now be marketed as ‘barn eggs’. We have worked closely with the sector and retailers to implement these changes as smoothly as possible.” The British Retail Consortium said that supermarkets would be providing signage to explain the change to consumers, but that “when the current measures are lifted, eggs will go back to being free-range”.The National Farmers’ Union’s chief poultry adviser, Aimee Mahony, said: “Shoppers may notice different labels on egg packs explaining that the eggs have been laid by hens temporarily housed to protect their health and welfare. Once the risk levels have reduced and the housing measures have been lifted by Defra, birds will be able to go outside again.”",News/World news,Free-range eggs unavailable in Britain from Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/free-range-eggs-unavailable-britain-avian-flu
3/19/2022,"The Kindertransport has gone from obscurity in the 1980s to a story of almost mythic quality today. Few politicians and commentators referencing it have much knowledge of its details, strengths and problems. It was, as its foremost historian Jennifer Craig-Norton describes, fundamentally a child separation movement, with all the later problems this created. Those offering their homes were subject to no safeguarding checks, leading to not infrequent cases of sexual and physical abuse and economic exploitation; some of the much larger number of refugee domestics allowed entry were similarly abused. The Jewish refugee children were also at the mercy of Christian proselytisation, both subtle and organised. Those today who raise alarm at the “light touch” checks on people volunteering to host Ukrainian refugees in the UK (Report, 15 March) have thus good historic reason for doing so. The desire to help Ukrainian refugees is indeed part of a neglected history of support in the UK (who, for example, remembers the Serbian child refugees brought in during the first world war?). We need, however, to ensure that those generously offering their homes today are thoroughly assessed so that the abuses of the past are not repeated.Prof Tony KushnerParkes Institute, University of Southampton; author, Remembering Refugees: Then and Now  Subject to safeguards being in place, I welcome the scheme announced for private individuals to house Ukrainian refugees. The government has, however, missed a trick. In 1972, the Heath government established the Uganda Resettlement Board to welcome, rehouse and resettle more than 28,600 people fleeing Idi Amin’s notorious regime. This was a multi-disciplinary board consisting of all the right people, who were able to find a way through the bureaucracy put in their way. It was led by my late father, a civil servant. The astonishing achievement was that it took them only six weeks to establish 16 resettlement camps and band together 63 voluntary organisations to welcome the first refugees, who arrived on 18 September with only what they could carry. This cohort of refugees have made some astonishing contributions to our country and stand as a refugee success story for us. I commend this model to the government. It’s not too late to have a more coherent and joined-up approach.Alan CritchleyColchester  I write as one of a large number of people who have offered a safe haven to Ukrainian refugees to help protect them from the assault on their county by the Putin dictatorship. However, having filled in the form to register my offer of accommodation, I am unclear about what I need to do next, and about who decides if my accommodation is suitable, or even if I am suitable. I do not know if there are any Ukrainian expats on the Isle of Wight to help with any language difficulties or assist those suffering from being exposed to the horrors of war, or worried about leaving loved ones behind to defend their country. We need leadership, which seems sadly lacking now.Bill MooreNewport, Isle of Wight  Helen Pidd’s frank article resonated with me (Thinking about offering a room to a Ukrainian refugee? Let me help, 14 March). Several years ago, an asylum seeker from Afghanistan, came to live with us thanks to Amnesty International. He had been imprisoned and tortured by the Taliban and thrown out for dead. A good Samaritan saved him. After a dangerous journey, he arrived in the UK and came to live with us, traumatised and unable to communicate. A perfect gentleman, he responded to our encouragement and revealed a wonderful sense of humour. It has been a privilege to know him, but a sorrow that someone so cultured and educated has only been able to find work as a lorry driver.Veronica EdwardsMalvern, Worcestershire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/19/2022,"I have read with interest recent correspondence regarding the efficacy of prayer. The presupposition is that if one prays for something, there should be evidence of answered prayer. When a study shows that there is no such evidence (Letters, 16 March), it is fair to say that prayer, so understood, doesn’t work. I wonder if there is a study to measure the effect that prayer has on the person praying? Prayer, for many of us, is not magic, not seeking the intervention of a lofty god whose reluctant arms need to be twisted. It is, rather, a participation in and a growing in compassion. It is we who are changed, through contemplation and stillness, centred on divine love. Painfully slowly (in my case at least), we then become better able to act compassionately and justly. We become the answer to our own prayer. That, truly, has the potential to change everything.Rev Kenneth CrossMinehead, Somerset  When arguing for or against the efficacy of prayer, account has to be taken of the nature of the request involved. If one drives at speed into a brick wall, one cannot expect the prayer to escape unscathed to be effective. So the person praying for peace, while supporting their country’s policy of providing combatants with lethal weapons, which prolong confrontation, should not be surprised when peace does not ensue. However, a prayer to be able to understand better the enemy’s point of view, their hopes and fears, while honestly examining one’s own side’s possible prejudices and misguided policies – such a prayer could be answered and indeed prove effective in stemming the horrors of armed conflict.

3/19/2022,"My husband, David Larder, who has died aged 88, was an educationist, going on from schoolteaching to posts as a college lecturer. After promoting safety education for the Royal for the Prevention of Accidents (Rospa), he worked for a student welfare organisation. Born in Boscombe, Dorset, to Rose Sque, a cleaner, and Walter Larder, a builder’s labourer and farm worker, he was educated at Brockenhurst grammar school in the New Forest and then the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. His youthful acting career was cut short in 1953 by national service with the Devonshire Regiment in Kenya during the uprising of the Land and Freedom Army there. Seeing it as a colonial war, he refused to use the propaganda term Mau Mau and after eight months’ service applied to register – successfully – as a conscientious objector on political grounds. In 1958 he qualified as a teacher at Bretton College of Education in Yorkshire before teaching first at Darton school for boys, Barnsley (1958-60), then drama and English at Woldgate comprehensive school, Pocklington, Yorkshire (1960-65). David then moved on to become a senior lecturer at Madeley College of Education in Stoke-on-Trent, where he set up one of the first degrees in drama, dance and film. In 1970 he took up a post at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University) as a senior lecturer in mass media. In 1975 he gained a degree in education at the University of Birmingham. Two years later David took up the post of director of safety education for Rospa , where he had much to do with the introduction of the Green Cross Man campaign, involving the Darth Vader actor David Prowse, into schools. Leaving Rospa in 1980, he became the manager at Mary Morris Student Housing in Leeds for 17 years, helping to care for thousands of international students from across the world, many of whom stayed in touch with him. He retired in 1997, when we moved to Harrogate. David’s experiences in Kenya informed the rest of his life, and he was involved in peace activism, including as chairman of the North of England committee of the United Nations International Year of Peace in 1986. He was a passionate supporter of the Labour party, which he had joined at the age of 15. In his spare time he was a keen amateur actor and director, and had small roles in shows such as the ITV drama Marcella (2016) and Mister Eleven (2009), as well as Sky One’s Dream Team.

The animated prequel for Toy Story’s Buzz Lightyear features a relationship between two female characters, one voiced by three-time Emmy winner Uzo Aduba. A kiss between the two had originally been removed but following recent uproar related to Disney’s handling of both LGBTQ characters and the recent “don’t say gay” bill, it has reportedly been restored. The move follows a letter released by LGBTQ Pixar employees, which claimed that Disney executives had insisted “overtly gay affection” was removed from all animated features. “We at Pixar have personally witnessed beautiful stories, full of diverse characters, come back from Disney corporate reviews shaved down to crumbs of what they once were,” it read. It was in response to Disney’s mishandling of the recent Florida bill that seeks to ban teaching of sexual identity and gender orientation in early-grade education as well as in “a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students”. After Disney initially remained quiet on the bill, it was then revealed that every politician who sponsored it had received donations from the studio. An internal statement from the CEO, Bob Chapek, said that the studio would “unequivocally stand” with LGBTQ employees but said that a public statement could be “weaponised”. This week then saw Disney staff stage a walkout in protest with Chapek then agreeing to pause all political donations in Florida.

3/19/2022,"P&O Ferries’ sacking of 800 seafarers was a cold-hearted, brutal affair. Staff lost their jobs without warning. The first inkling many had was when they began watching a corporate video message. Some were marched off ships by security guards wearing balaclavas and carrying handcuffs. Unions said P&O had bussed in lower-paid contract staff from abroad to replace them. This is a betrayal of a workforce who kept Britain supplied throughout the pandemic. If there was an unacceptable face of capitalism today, it would be worn by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the emir of Dubai and billionaire head of the state that owns and controls P&O. The ferry operator’s chief executive, Peter Hebblethwaite, its third in three years, said the company had to sack workers and replace them with cheaper crew to remain viable. This does not stack up. P&O’s owner DP World, the state-owned ports operator, was flush with cash and could afford to pay sailors properly. This month DP World announced bumper profits of $896m (£751m) in 2021, up from $846m in 2020. The mass sackings are probably not even lawful. The company did not give ministers the legally mandated 45 days’ notice of its intent. Failure to do so is a criminal offence. What P&O has attempted to do, it seems, is to offer compensation packages that purport to pay their way out of the company’s legal obligations, such as consulting staff. This was probably done to prevent trade unions from seeking an injunction to stop the sackings. Such sops won’t wash with the public, who know that P&O has acted in a cruel, inhumane and unethical manner. The government must not give the green light to such acts. Yet the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has gone no further than rebuking the company. A junior minister suggested P&O should hand back the £10m in furlough cash that it took. Without meaningful sanction, ministers are washing their hands of the episode and letting, in effect, a foreign state sack workers in Britain from secure jobs and replace them with agency staff. If Boris Johnson is prepared to level down employment rights to those suffered by workers in the Gulf, so much for promises that post-Brexit Britain would be “the best place in the world to work”. P&O’s Dubai owners could be forced to do the right thing and rehire the 800 seafarers. Ministers might threaten to end the two freeport contracts it has with DP World unless P&O relents. Mr Johnson was forewarned about the company’s plans a day before they were enacted – just as he left meetings in the United Arab Emirates. It’s not a stretch to think that he was told while there. After all, Sheikh Mohammed is the UAE’s prime minister. Mr Johnson was seeking help to ease rocketing oil prices. It would be a tawdry deal if he traded away workers’ livelihoods for a few barrels of oil. Perhaps Mr Johnson thinks that Britain’s trade unions need to be cowed into submission before inflation kicks in. Maybe he thinks that DP World was right to back a £147m deal to sponsor European golf while there is a £146m deficit in the pension fund for P&O retirees. He may reason that Dubai is impervious to the reputational damage sustained by a campaign associating the emirate with the toxic decisions made by UK-based executives. But the bullying tactics of the 1980s cannot be resurrected today. The world has moved on. When those who own or run companies enrich themselves extravagantly, heedless of the cost to their current and former staff, trust erodes and capitalism itself becomes threatened. Curing this disease calls for the public shaming of P&O and its owners – as well as consequential threats. The sailors should be reinstated.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on P&O’s betrayal of workers: capitalism’s unacceptable face,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/18/the-guardian-view-on-pos-betrayal-of-workers-capitalisms-unacceptable-face
3/19/2022,"When Dubai Ports Ltd first bought up the ports and ships of P&O 16 years ago, the question that preoccupied a country reeling from the 2005 Islamist terrorist attacks was Britain’s physical security. Now, the questions are focused on the economic security of Britain’s workforce. From DP World’s vantage point in the Gulf, the crew of the loss-making ferries of P&O may never have been a pressing concern. The heart of DP World’s global operation is the enormous Jebel Ali port, at the trading crossroads of continents, boasting the largest artificial harbour in the world, incorporating ever more and ever bigger container ships. It is also one of the world’s biggest free trade zones. Such zones are a place where businesses can incorporate with the lightest of tax and regulatory frameworks. DP World is ultimately owned by Dubai’s ruling royal family. The chairman and group chief executive is Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, who has long been near the heart of government; he chairs a government department that includes the Dubai customs workforce, and leads the Jebel Ali free zone authority. Bin Sulayem and DP World originally bought P&O – then a London listed company – in 2006 for £3.3bn. It paid a huge premium, about 70% over the market value, for a group that Margaret Thatcher had once described as “the fabric of the British empire”. However, the ports were always its key target: Bin Sulayem admitted then that he had limited knowledge of the ferry business that came alongside, but denied he had plans to sell them off. They were however sold to a separate state-owned entity, Dubai World, around the time of the financial crisis, before DP World bought them back for $322m (£244m) in 2019. Among its 70 ports worldwide, the closest to home, as far as most sacked P&O workers see it, are the big container operations at London Gateway and Southampton. Both now are the central hubs of the first freeports, Thames and Solent, putting DP World firmly in the slipstream of post-Brexit government economic policy. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has championed the controversial freeports as a key part of levelling up – allegedly providing more jobs for the deprived port regions. Critics have already questioned the freeport model as potential “mini-tax havens” that could fuel a race to the bottom on regulation, and see more profits sent offshore rather than reinvested in the UK. DP World however has been a key proponent: it says it has already “replicated in key international locations” the model of Jebel Ali. “By expanding this successful model we now own, develop and operate industrial parks, inland cargo depots, special economic zones and specialist facilities around the world that help to enable trade.” More politicians may now be questioning an economic model developed in Dubai. Even outside Jebel Ali in Dubai, as in all Gulf states, employment law is hardly weighted to the worker: largely carried out by migrants operating under the kafala system, in which employers have the right to decide if they can ever change job, or leave the country. Those reporting from Britain have also apparently felt the strain: P&O Ferries had three chief executives in little over a year, after first Janette Bell in August 2020 and then David Stretch in November 2021 handed in their notice to Dubai. The latest, Peter Hebblethwaite, handed over the job of firing crew by video to the HR chief, Stephen Nee. DP World said that both “left the business for completely unrelated reasons” to this week’s mass sackings. DP World and P&O Ferries have also been embroiled in controversy over a £146m deficit in the industry-wide seafarers’ pension fund, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund, where P&O is the largest single employer. Parts of the Royal Navy’s pensions are involved, and the taxpayer could be left on the hook if P&O do not pay the money they owe. While that row rumbles on, DP World signed up last November to sponsor the European golf tour for an even bigger sum – footing the lion’s share of the $200m prize money. Meanwhile, the global operation rolls on: it paid out a dividend of $332m in 2020, and saw its revenues jump 27% to a record $10.8bn in 2021, in results announced by Bin Sulayem earlier this month. On Wednesday, as DP World marshalled security teams in British ports to escort crew off ships, he tweeted from a seminar in the UAE, speaking to young Emiratis: “I strongly believe in investing in the next generation.”",News/Business,DP World’s controversial history of P&O ownership,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/dp-world-p-and-o-ownership-dubai
