2/5/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has suggested new laws would hold to account streaming sites airing jokes such as those made by Jimmy Carr about the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller community and the Holocaust. Anti-hate groups including the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial and Hope Not Hate have condemned the comedian’s comments in his Netflix special.  Carr issued a “trigger warning” to the audience at the beginning of his one-hour special, His Dark Material, admitting his performance contained “terrible things”. In a widely shared clip from the show, Carr joked about the horror of “six million Jewish lives being lost” before suggesting the deaths of thousands of Gypsies at the hands of the Nazis had been one of “the positives” of the Holocaust. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Saturday, the culture secretary said the comments were “abhorrent and they just shouldn’t be on television”. She said: “We are looking at legislation via the media bill, which would bring into scope those comments from other video-on-demand streaming outlets like Netflix.” It was put to her that in a tweet in 2017 she had claimed that “leftwing snowflakes are killing comedy”. She said: “Well, that’s not comedy. What Jimmy Carr did last night is not comedy. And you know, I’m no angel on Twitter, nobody is, but I just would like to say that nothing I’ve ever put on Twitter has been harmful or abusive. “But that last night … Jimmy Carr’s comments, no one can call that, you know, snowflake or wokeishness, that’s just … it was just appalling.” She said the comments were “shocking and abhorrent and unacceptable, not just because he was making fun on the basis of people who died in the most appalling circumstances, but on the pain and suffering of many thousands of families”. Dorries told Times Radio: “We don’t have the ability now, legally, to hold Netflix to account for streaming that, but very shortly we will.” The comedian and writer David Baddiel condemned Carr’s comments on Twitter on Saturday and suggested they were “cruel and inhumane and mean-spirited and racist”. Baddiel shared an excerpt from his Trolls: Not The Dolls tour “as part of a bit arguing that it’s not the subject matter of a joke that counts, it’s the specifics of the individual joke”. I said this every night during my Trolls: Not The Dolls tour as part of a bit arguing that it's not the subject matter of a joke that counts, it's the specifics of the individual joke. Clearly, Jimmy Carr's was the former. pic.twitter.com/xI4yWt9U0T “Meanwhile, away from stupid discussions about the limits of comedy, my sympathies are with the Roma and Sinti community who suffered so much during the Holocaust,” Baddiel added. The chief executive of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Olivia Marks-Woldman, said she and the rest of the organisation were “horrified that gales of laughter followed [Carr’s] remarks”. “Hundreds of thousands of Roma and Sinti people suffered prejudice, slave labour, sterilisation and mass murder simply because of their identity – these are not experiences for mockery,” Marks-Woldman added. The Traveller Movement, a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK, said the comments were “truly disturbing” and went “way beyond humour”. In a tweet, the charity announced that it had launched a petition to Netflix calling for “the removal of the segments of His Dark Material which celebrate the Romani genocide”. The Auschwitz Memorial urged Carr on Twitter to “learn about the fate of some 23 thousand Roma & Sinti deported to Auschwitz”, adding: “It’s sad to hear words that can fuel prejudice, hurt people & defile memory of their tragedy.” A representative for Carr has been contacted for comment.",Arts/Culture,New laws would hold Netflix to account after ‘shocking’ Jimmy Carr joke,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/nadine-dorries-proposes-law-to-rein-in-streamers-after-shocking-jimmy-carr-joke
2/5/2022,"It only took two days for Louan Bengmah’s French-language version of the viral Wordle game to run into trouble. His online dictionary threw up “slush”, Québécois slang that was essentially an English word co-opted in North America. French players hoping to join the hundreds of thousands of English speakers cluttering up social media with boastful grids showing how quickly they had guessed a mystery word, were frustrated.  “I got a lot of criticism, and I understand why, because it wasn’t really French,” he said ruefully. He has since combed the wordbank used for his game to weed out similar loan words from other languages. Despite these teething problems, his program has taken off – one of dozens of Wordle copies around the world drawing in non-English-speaking audiences that may soon rival the millions playing the original game. There are few languages in the world, dead or alive, that don’t seem to have at least an amateur Wordle clone. The game’s relative simplicity – just one five-letter word a day, and six chances to guess it – make it relatively easy to create similar programs from scratch, helping drive the global spread of the craze. A “Wordles of the World” page on the website GitHub lists over 350 entries. Some are English-language versions like a Harry Potter-focused “wizarding wordle” and the self-explanatory Sweardle (swear words), but over 100 are in other languages, from Somali to Icelandic, Hindi to Hebrew. A few have become juggernauts in their own right, like the Portuguese version Termo. “I worked on it for a week or so – I did not expect it to go the way it did,” said its creator Fernando Serboncini, 40, who now has 400,000 users but makes no money from the game. Others remain a bit more niche. Old Norse was spoken in the late medieval period in Iceland and Norway, surviving only in written form after the 16th century, but it too has a Wordle, created by Tarrin Jon Wills, a dictionary editor. It has been wildly successful by the standards of a language that only a few thousand people read regularly. Since he put it up two weeks ago, visitor numbers to the dictionary site have doubled and there are a couple of hundred regular players. “Part of it is just a game, but part of it is a way of seeing if we can get people to engage with the dictionary and the project that we’re working on. And that’s worked out quite well,” Wills said. Linguistic differences mean adaptation to other languages can be challenging, and require major changes. In China, words are formed from characters rather than the letters of an alphabet. Li Zhong, a programmer living in the historic city of Hangzhou, wanted to create a version for Chinese players. It took him a few days chatting with his sister to think about how to adapt a game based on guessing letters. Rather than words, his game throws up a kind of Chinese idiom known as chengyu, always composed of four characters, and dotted through daily speech. It now has over 70,000 users, the majority in Singapore. “The success of Wordle shows that not everything has to be an app, and you don’t always need a big company to create a product that really takes off,” he said. The New York Times bought the rights to the original Wordle last month, but declined to comment on whether it would seek to crack down on clones in other languages. Lawyers say it might struggle to push them offline. Depending on local copyright laws, it might at best be able to lean on imitators to change their colour scheme and layout away from Wordle’s green, grey and yellow grid. “Generally speaking, copyright does not protect ideas, only specific expressions of those ideas,” said Kathy Berry, an intellectual property lawyer at Linklaters. That would cover the code and graphics of a game like Wordle, but not the underlying idea. Wordle’s simplicity, which is a large part of its appeal, might also make it harder to chase copycats, because its format echoes ones used by many other games and gameshows in the past. Awais Athar, a computer scientist from Cambridge, created an Urdu language version three weeks ago – Urdle. He decided to make the words shorter and add an extra guess, to reflect a different linguistic structure. “A four-letter Urdu word can have as much phonetic information as a seven-lettered word in English,” he said. “Decreasing the word length made sense from the start to increase playability without making it too challenging.” Like other creators of Wordle in different languages, he combines experience of programming with a love of word games, and was initially drawn in to playing the English-language version before deciding to launch his own three weeks ago. He’s hopeful the New York Times won’t try to crush the global Wordle movement. “I hope they don’t shut adaptations down,” he said. “[It seems from media reports] their acquisition aims to introduce more word games to existing Wordle players, and I am all for it. Word games make people happy and we should spread the joy as much as possible!”",Arts/Games,"Urdu, Chinese, even Old Norse: how Wordle spread across the globe",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/feb/05/urdu-chinese-even-old-norse-how-wordle-spread-across-the-globe
2/5/2022,"For decades, artists have worked across physical and digital canvases, especially in public installations, where a virtual component can lend a futuristic frisson to traditional works. The current brouhaha about NFTs – digital artworks to which proof of ownership can be bought, assigning currently indeterminate rights to the buyer – makes the Serpentine Gallery’s New Fiction exhibition feel especially of the moment, however. The show (admission free) features physical and digital works by Kaws, AKA the Brooklyn-based artist Brian Donnelly, the digital works viewed via a third-party augmented reality app downloaded on to a smartphone.  Visitors must calibrate the app on arrival; point your phone camera at a QR code outside the gallery and the scene fills with towering, brightly painted figures, including an emaciated Cookie Monster-like character who sits, legs a-dangling, from the plinth above the entrance. Inside, you must again calibrate the app, at which point you wander around the rooms, figuratively brushing shoulders with virtual “visitors” who also form part of the installation. It’s an uncanny feeling seeing virtual characters observe physical works of art (typically, these days, it’s us, the corporeal, who perennially gaze upon the digital), and the sense of discombobulation is compounded by the fact that the exhibit features actual brightly painted bronze statues. Donnelly’s work is ideally suited to the moment in its aesthetic and subject matter, too. His cartoonish characters have the feel of post-apocalyptic Disney classics, cuddly but also fraught, with Xs for eyes. On the canvas, these characters seem lost in mazes built from the debris of modern civilization: snapped steel beams, tyre fragments. This feels like Armageddon, but painted in the fashionable neon colours of 90s-era sports Lycra. Donnelly’s juxtaposition of candy curved shapes and colour with scenes of desecration resonates with our current species-wide anxieties: our saturated state of constant entertainment (usually administered via digital channels) at odds with our fears about the state of the physical world, and our complicity in its decline. Fitting, too, that this show should have been made in collaboration with Epic Games, creators of Fortnite, arguably the dominant digital playground for young people. Epic were responsible for last year’s superlative Kid A Mnesia digital exhibition, released for PlayStation, Mac and Window to coincide with the 21st anniversary of the release of Radiohead’s seminal records, which succeeded in providing players with a mesmerising and highly memorable experience by blending the traditional gallery experience with flourishes that would have been impossible outside a virtual context. New Fiction, which has also been rendered in Fortnite to allow players anywhere in the world to “visit”, is a more conservative effort, perhaps due to the fact it also had to work in person. It is, nevertheless, a mostly successful experiment in this rapidly evolving blend of the physical and digital. Some argue that the old distinctions between the real and the virtual are now meaningless (anyone who has experienced an online pile-on and been left feeling as though they had been physically attacked will agree). New Fiction shows that it is possible, in an artistic context, to ignore those old distinctions. Then again, put the phone in your pocket and, in reality, you won’t miss too much.

2/5/2022,"Bristol Old Vic’s outgoing artistic director Tom Morris has defended his decision to publicly highlight the slave trade riches that financed the theatre’s construction and urged the city to face up to slavery’s legacy if it is to battle the scourge of racism today. Morris, who is stepping down in the autumn after 12 years, said it had been vital – in order to engage with the city’s African-Caribbean community –to acknowledge the brutal origins of the vast fortunes that paid for the theatre in the 18th century.  “Our theatre was built in 1766 when really the only source of income in the whole British economy was directly or indirectly related to the transatlantic slave trade – but it was undeniably so in Bristol,” he said. “That represents something important to [African-Caribbean] communities, and it is our duty to be honest about it. As soon as you start to be honest you are in a conversation, not a standoff.” At least 15 of the 50 people who contributed £50 to found the celebrated Georgian theatre were merchants involved in the slave trade, with the others benefiting indirectly. In return, the founders were given specially minted silver tokens granting them seats to see all performances. Morris, who is best known as the co-creator of the National Theatre’s hit show War Horse, revealed that he faced a backlash from some of the theatre’s donors who accused him of “dragging up history” unnecessarily. But he insisted it was the right course of action. “The history of this theatre and this city can’t be buried, if we want to make social change now, partly because its burial is a denial of the very real legacy of damage, which it leaves on our fellow citizens,” said Morris. “But partly because there are lessons about how to make social change happen now.” There are many in the city, he added, still seeking to diminish the horrors of a trade in human beings by suggesting the moral standards of today cannot be applied to a bygone era. “But accounts of the time show that almost everyone [in Bristol] thinks the trade is execrable – meaning extremely morally repugnant. The idea they didn’t know it is wrong is complete fiction. But they couldn’t seize the opportunity to change it because the economic and social cost was – they thought – too high.” Morris also played a key role in encouraging the Bristol Post to offer an apology for a notorious front-page splash in 1996, which featured the mugshots of 16 black men, convicted of drugs offences, under the headline “Faces of Evil”. Morris brokered a meeting between the newspaper’s editor and the race equality campaigner Roger Griffith, which led to the apology in 2018. The theatre’s new season, which will be Morris’s last, includes The Meaning of Zong, a play by the Olivier award-winning Hamilton actor, Giles Terera, about Olaudah Equiano, a former slave, who helped galvanise the abolition movement in Britain. The 12 years of Morris’s tenure have been eventful. He has steered the theatre through austerity arts cuts and the pandemic, which is still affecting the arts sector. The most perilous days, however, came during the early stages of the pandemic, before the government stepped in with a £1.57bn culture recovery fund in July 2020. “We got to the point of if something doesn’t happen in six to eight weeks, we’re going to have to mothball and dismantle the business in a way that would take decades to recover,” he said. “That was our worst-case scenario.” The Old Vic, which is the oldest working theatre in the English-speaking world, found itself exposed because it had come to rely on ticket sales during the austerity era. The theatre was forced to make a third of its workforce redundant. “We’d gone from a situation where 40% of our turnover was commercially earned to the situation, after 10 years of austerity, where 75% of our income was trading income, essentially ticket sales and bar sales,” he said. “When we were suddenly forced to close, we lost 75% of our income. The job retention scheme stopped us from going bust. If the culture recovery fund had been quicker, we wouldn’t have made so many people redundant.” Morris, who is credited with reviving the ailing theatre, is leaving in the autumn because he feels it needs fresh leadership and he wants to pursue other interests, including potentially making films and putting on a classical music prom. Nevertheless, he is excited by his last season, which is seeking to provide an opportunity for people to think about the major themes emerging from the pandemic, including public health and racial justice. “Our main job is to entertain people, otherwise they won’t return – but at the same time it’s part of our civic role to hold the space for the big topics of our times.”",Arts/Stage,‘I was right to speak out about slavery money that built Bristol Old Vic’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/05/i-was-right-to-speak-out-slavery-money-bristol-old-vic-tom-morris

2/5/2022,"Two more Conservative MPs, Nick Gibb and Aaron Bell, on Friday called for Boris Johnson to resign because of “partygate”, bringing the total so far to 15. In order for a no-confidence vote to be triggered, the chair of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, must receive letters from at least 54 MPs – 15% of the Conservative party.  Here is the full list of MPs who have urged the prime minister to stand down, although not all have said that they have formally communicated their demands to Brady. Nick Gibb The former education minister and MP for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton wrote in the Telegraph that his constituents were “furious about the double standards” and said Johnson had been “inaccurate” in statements to the Commons. He said he had submitted a letter of no confidence, adding: “To restore trust, we need to change the prime minister.” Aaron Bell The MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, one of the Conservatives’ 2019 “red wall” intake, announced he had submitted a letter of no confidence, saying: “The breach of trust that events in No 10 Downing Street represent, and the manner in which they have been handled, makes his position untenable.” His statement, on Friday, came days after an emotional moment in the Commons when he asked Johnson if he thought he was a “fool” for following Covid restrictions at his grandmother’s funeral. Roger GaleThe North Thanet MP said he submitted a letter of no confidence more than 18 months ago after the Dominic Cummings Barnard Castle scandal in 2020. He recently described Johnson as a “dead man walking” politically after his apology for attending a lockdown “bring your own booze” party in the garden of No 10. Douglas RossThe Scottish Conservatives’ leader described the prime minister’s position as “untenable” following his admission to attending the BYOB event and that he “could not continue” to lead the British government. The MP for Moray is understood to have submitted a no-confidence letter. Andrew BridgenThe Brexiter and MP for North West Leicestershire accused Johnson of presiding over a “moral vacuum at the heart of our government”. In an article for the Daily Telegraph, he urged him to “go now with some semblance of grace”. “With a heavy heart” he said he had submitted a letter of no confidence. Peter AldousThe Waveney MP tweeted on 1 February that “after a great deal of soul-searching” he had sent a letter of no confidence. He said he had “never taken such action before” but that it was “in the best interests of the country”. Tobias EllwoodThe MP for Bournemouth East and chair of the defence select committee said Johnson had lost his support, calling on him to “call a vote of confidence rather than waiting for the inevitable 54 letters to be eventually submitted”. He said it was “horrible” for MPs to have to defend partygate and confirmed on Wednesday that he had submitted his letter. Anthony MangnallThe Totnes MP, part of the 2019 intake, spoke against Johnson’s “actions and mistruths” as he said he was calling for a no-confidence vote. He tweeted: “Standards in public life matter. At this time I can no longer support the PM.” Gary StreeterCalling for a motion of no confidence in the prime minister, the South West Devon MP said: “I cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice of the vast majority of the British public during lockdown with the attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street.” William WraggThe Hazel Grove MP and chairman of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee said last month that the prime minister’s position had become “untenable”. He has not said publicly whether he has submitted a letter. Caroline NokesDescribing Johnson as “a liability”, the former immigration minister and MP for Romsey and Southampton North said on 12 January that Johnson must either leave now or in the next general election. She has not confirmed whether she has sent a letter. Tim LoughtonThe former children’s minister and MP for East Worthing & Shoreham said in a Facebook post on 15 January that he had “regretfully come to the conclusion that Boris Johnson’s position is now untenable”. It is not known whether he has submitted a letter. David DavisThe former Brexit secretary and MP for Haltemprice and Howden sent shockwaves when he told Johnson during prime minister’s questions on 19 January: “You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.” But he later said he wanted to wait for details of Sue Gray’s report before submitting a letter of no confidence. Asked whether he had made a submission as of 31 January, he told LBC: “No, not yet.” Andrew MitchellAfter Johnson’s House of Commons statement following the publication of the update on the Gray inquiry on 31 January, the former cabinet minister and Sutton Coldfield MP said the prime minister “no longer enjoys my support”. He has not said whether he has contacted Brady. Charles WalkerThe vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee and Broxbourne MP said on 1 February he would “applaud” the prime minister if he decided to stand down but that it was “his decision”.
