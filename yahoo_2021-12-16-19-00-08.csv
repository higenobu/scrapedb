12/16/2021,"Some health officials have expressed reserved optimism that the coronavirus omicron strain could be a significant step in the pandemic's transition to becoming endemic, with one expert calling initial studies ""the ideal situation for a virus."" Dr. Adam Koppel, the managing director of Bain Capital Life Sciences, told the Massachusetts High Technology panel on Tuesday that if the projections are true and omicron becomes the dominant global strain, it will ""enable us to more quickly get to an endemic state as opposed to a pandemic state where we can live more regularly with the virus more similar to the flu than what COVID has looked like,"" the Boston Herald reported. COVID-19 PANDEMIC DEATH TOLL TOPS 800,000 IN U.S. Scientists studying the variant have stressed that there is still much to be learned about the new variant. They say they are troubled by its transmissibility and insist that we still do not have a clear picture as to why it appears less severe than, say, delta. It may be infecting younger, healthier individuals. Researchers from the University of Hong Kong seemed to support earlier studies in South Africa that found the variant highly contagious, but less severe. CHILDREN'S COVID-19 CASES UP 32% FROM TWO WEEKS AGO, PEDIATRICIANS REPORT They found that the variant infects people about 70 times faster than earlier strains but replicated less efficiently—about 10 times lower in lung tissue, Bloomberg reported. The report said that early indicators say most of those infected don’t need oxygen nor do they require ICU care. But the sheer amount of cases could still put serious pressure on hospitals. In South Africa, although case numbers are rising, hospital admissions for adults diagnosed with COVID-19 are 29% lower compared to the wave the country experienced in mid-2020, after adjusting for vaccination status, according to the new analysis. Still, some experts cautioned that it’s too soon to draw conclusions since the variant is quite new and hospitalizations can lag weeks behind infections. CLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS ""By infecting many more people, a very infectious virus may cause more severe disease and death even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic,"" the lead author in the Hong Kong study said, according to Bloomberg. An analysis Tuesday of data from South Africa, where the new variant is driving a surge in infections, suggests the Pfizer vaccine offers less defense against infection from omicron and reduced, but still good, protection from hospitalization.

12/16/2021,"Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) branded Rep. Jim Jordan a “traitor to the Constitution” after the Ohio Republican admitted to sending a text to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Jan. 5 suggesting then-Vice President Mike Pence should stop the certification of the 2020 election. “Look, Jim Jordan is a traitor. He’s a traitor to the Constitution of the United States. He has been a traitor to the Constitution of the United States for quite a while, and now we actually have it in text,” Gallego told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell Wednesday night on “The Last Word.” “Why is anybody surprised?” Gallego asked, and pointed to Jordan’s lies on the House floor on Jan. 6 about voter fraud in states like Arizona. However, Gallego said Jordan was not his biggest concern. “My biggest issue is the fact that there’s a lot of people out there that are not taking this seriously,” Gallego said. “The fact that there is a slow-moving coup that is happening right now all over this country that are led by the Jim Jordans and other people.” Gallego described an insidious process whereby instead of people storming the Capitol to overthrow an election, supporters of former President Donald Trump’s “Big Lie” were trying to win state House and Senate seats and election administration roles so they could “actually overturn the future election.” “The coup is ongoing,” he said. Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) after Jim Jordan revealed he sent that Pence text to Mark Meadows:

The committee said it was sent by an unnamed lawmaker. The text laid out a legal theory that claimed Pence had the authority to halt the certification of the Electoral College count on Jan. 6. Jordan’s office said Joseph Schmitz, a conservative attorney and onetime foreign policy adviser on Trump’s 2016 campaign, wrote the message and sent it to the congressman.

12/16/2021,"Mainland China will supposedly have a difficult time launching a full-scale invasion of Taiwan over problems that mostly have to do with logistics, according to a new report by Taiwan's Defense Ministry.

Why it matters: The threat assessment was sent to legislators, according to Reuters. If correct, Taipei improves its odds of securing its sovereignty against China, whose warplanes have increasingly patrolled the Taiwan Strait in recent months.
 According to the ministry, China’s transport capacity is currently restricted. ""However, the nation's military strongly defends ports and airports, and they will not be easy to occupy in a short time. Landing operations will face extremely high risks,"" the ministry wrote. Those that manage to land would then need to be resupplied not only with weapons but also with food, medicine and other necessities. ""The nation's military has the advantage of the Taiwan Strait being a natural moat and can use joint intercept operations, cutting off the Communist military's supplies, severely reducing the combat effectiveness and endurance of the landing forces,” the ministry declared. The ministry also believes that China must keep some of its own forces close by to deal with foreign forces coming to Taiwan’s aid. Aside from U.S. and Japanese bases near the self-governed island, China should also pay attention to “fractious areas of China's border,” including those with India and the South China Sea. 
 The big picture: In October, Taiwan said China would be capable of a full-scale invasion by 2025. It also said that it will not start a war but will defend itself “full on,” according to CNBC.
 China has ramped up its presence in Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in recent months. The increasing tension has led to speculations of an impending war described by one former Chinese diplomat as “Armageddon.” The U.S. has affirmed its support for Taipei under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. Earlier this month, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs Ely Ratner said there is an “urgent” need to bolster the island’s defenses, according to The Hill. Still, experts believe China has other ways to overcome Taiwan. These include a blockade and targeted missile attacks, Reuters noted.
