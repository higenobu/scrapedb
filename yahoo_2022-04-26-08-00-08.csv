4/26/2022,"During a Monday meeting at Moscow’s Prosecutor General’s Office, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a shocking accusation, announcing the arrest of several accused assassins who were allegedly planning to kill prominent Russian state TV journalist and ardent Putin loyalist Vladimir Solovyov. “This morning, organs of the FSB halted the activities of a terrorist group that was planning an attack and a murder of a prominent Russian TV journalist,” Putin stated, claiming that the plot was orchestrated by “high-ranking diplomatic officials in Europe and the United States” who are striving to divide Russian society and “destroy Russia from within.” Putin alleged that the West’s failure to prevail on the information front of the war in Ukraine has prompted it “to resort to terror, to arrange the killings of our journalists.” He added: “We know the names of the sponsors from Western intelligence agencies, first of all—of course—from the United States’ CIA, which are working with Ukraine’s security services.” Russia’s notorious FSB counterintelligence agency released a video of the arrests, as well as so-called “behind-the-scenes” footage of agents searching and seizing property allegedly found at the suspects’ apartment, which was posted in its entirety by state media outlet RIA Novosti on Telegram. The footage showed an array of items laid out in the apartment, including a photograph of Adolf Hitler, six pristine-looking Ukrainian passports, a blonde wig, and brand new T-shirts emblazoned with swastikas that appeared to bear fresh creases from recent shipping. But the seemingly brand new items weren’t the only curious elements depicted in the FSB video footage. In the original video, three copies of a Sims video game were shown laid out on the bed, as well as a book containing a menacing inscription, stating in part: “Kill to live and live to kill,” signed with the name of “Signature unclear.” Social media users were quick to point that the SIMS game and “Signature unclear” could be signs that the arrest was part of an FSB hoax gone wrong, pointing out the directives for setting up the scene of the crime might have included planting three SIM cards and signing the book with an indiscernible signature—and that these instructions might have been misunderstood or taken too literally by the agents. Perhaps realizing their agents have flubbed, official videos posted by the FSB on its YouTube channel excluded the book and blurred the images of the SIMS video games. Russian FSB has fabricated a ""plot"" to kill Russian TV propagandist Solovyov. Allegedly by Ukrainian SBU and Nazis. One of the ""evidences"" is neonazi inscription on a book. Signed by ""Signature unclear"". Yes, FSB got an order to sign it with a ""signature unclear"" - and did so! pic.twitter.com/P1vnDOXOIB — Sergej Sumlenny (@sumlenny) April 25, 2022 Despite obvious holes in the official narrative of the so-called assassination plot, the Kremlin appears to be sticking with its story. On Monday, director of the Russian Federal Security Service Alexander Bortnikov told Russia’s Rossiya-1 channel that a group of six Russian neo-Nazis were indeed planning to kill state TV host Vladimir Solovyov on the orders of Ukraine’s Security Services. In his interview with the state media outlet RIA Novosti, Solovyov said he didn’t notice being followed and profusely thanked the FSB for saving his life. But the groundwork for Monday’s accusations seems to have been laid out days prior: two days before the arrests, Solovyov claimed that during his morning jog, he was accosted by unknown harassers. “I was jogging down the embankment today, as two fat bastards have driven past me on their bicycles, yelling ‘Glory to Ukraine,’” he said during his show Solovyov Live. “They were too scared to stop and get punched by me right into their greasy faces. We’ll trace and find them, no question, because it’s all on video... We need to catch all the scumbags over here.” Solovyov, a vocal supporter of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, baselessly accused Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky of spearheading the alleged plot to assassinate him, and claimed to have been targeted because he is a Jewish journalist. Rossiya-1 reported that the “Neo-Nazi assassins” admitted to planning the murder of other state media personalities, showing a clip of one unnamed plotter whose face was blurred who said they had also planned to take out state TV host Dmitry Kiselyov, head of RT Margarita Simonyan, her husband Tigran Keosayan, as well as pro-Putin pundits Olga Skabeeva and Evgeny Popov. Inside The Bizarre Conspiracy Theory That Halted Putin’s Bombing Plans During a Monday evening broadcast of state TV show 60 Minutes, Olga Skabeeva concluded: “Ukraine officially became the sponsor of terrorism.” Earlier in April, during his phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, Zelensky had asked for the United States to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism. Today’s allegations seek to bounce that accusation back into Ukraine’s lap. Opening his evening show on Monday, Solovyov seemed positively giddy while discussing the alleged plot to kill him. He chuckled about having to answer calls and give interviews about the arrests, and laughed about how the president of Ukraine must have orchestrated the scheme out of professional jealousy. As it turns out, Solovyov didn’t seem to be taking the alleged attempts on his life half as seriously as he did the seizure of his Italian villas due to Western sanctions.

4/26/2022,"McConnell was reportedly ""exhilarated"" after January 6 because he thought Trump had been discredited. ""He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,"" he said after the attack. McConnell also said that Trump, who he hasn't spoken to since December 2020, is ""despicable."" In the immediate hours after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was reportedly optimistic that the violent riot had finally discredited former President Donald Trump. ""I feel exhilarated by the fact that this fellow finally, totally discredited himself,"" McConnell told New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin in the hours after the attack, adding that Trump was ""was pretty thoroughly discredited by this."" That's according to an excerpt from ""This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America's Future,"" a forthcoming book from Martin and fellow Times reporter Alex Burns, that was reported by the Washington Post on Monday. One year after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, more than 700 people have been charged. The FBI is still seeking information about people involved in the riots. ""He put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger,"" said McConnell, reportedly standing in a doorway of the Capitol after midnight. ""Couldn't have happened at a better time."" McConnell also reportedly asked Martin ""what do you hear about the Twenty-Fifth Amendment?"" hoping to gain insight into whether members of Trump's cabinet were interested in removing the former president. According to the book, McConnell also called Trump a ""despicable person"" in a meeting with staffers late into the evening after the attack. But while McConnell hasn't spoken to Trump since December 2020 — once the Electoral College had affirmed President Joe Biden's election victory — he later backed down from the idea of potentially impeaching Trump, citing a legal argument popular among Republican senators that impeaching a former president was not appropriate. ""I didn't get to be leader by voting with five people in the conference,"" McConnell told a friend, according to the book. ""If President Trump were still in office, I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge,"" McConnell said on the floor the day the Senate acquitted Trump. ""But in this case, that question is moot. Because former President Trump is constitutionally not eligible for conviction."" A spokesman for McConnell declined to comment to the Post.

4/26/2022,"(Reuters) -Russian forces attempted to storm the Ukrainian-held Azovstal steel plant in the besieged southeastern city of Mariupol on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments last week that the complex did not need to be taken. Ukraine's armed forces command wrote on Facebook that Russian forces were firing and performing ""offensive operations"" in the Azovstal area, as well as conducting air strikes on civilian infrastructure. Serhiy Volyna, commander of Ukraine's 36th Marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker that was shown on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was hitting the complex with air and artillery bombardments. ""We are taking casualties, the situation is critical... we have very many wounded men, (some) are dying, it's a difficult (situation) with guns, ammunition, food, medicines... the situation is rapidly worsening,"" Volyna said, speaking from his location at the plant. Konstantin Ivaschenko, the official who has been designated mayor of Mariupol by Russia but not recognised as such by Ukraine, denied that any fighting was taking place in the city in comments reported by Russian news outlet TASS on Sunday. Reuters could not independently verify the Ukrainian or Russian the accounts. The Azovstal steel factory is the main remaining Ukrainian stronghold in Mariupol, a city that has seen sustained bombardment since the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych wrote on Facebook that ""Russian troops are trying to finish off the defenders of Azovstal and more than 1,000 civilians who are hiding at the plant"". Russia has denied targetting civilians in what it calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Later on Sunday, Arestovych said in a video address released by the president's office that Ukraine was offering Russia a ""special"" round of negotiations to be held in Mariupol to discuss the fate of the civilians and Ukrainian troops still trapped in the city. The negotiations would be intended to establish an immediate ceasefire in Mariupol, ""multi-day"" humanitarian corridors, and the freeing or swapping of Ukrainian fighters trapped in the Azovstal plant, Arestovych said. Russian troops surrounded the Azovstal plant in early March and have gradually taken control of most of the city. Last Thursday, Putin declared that Mariupol had been ""liberated"" and publicly told his defence minister to call off the storming of the Azovstal plant so as to save the lives of Russian soldiers. Putin said the plant should be ""blocked off"" instead.

4/26/2022,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Military spending in Europe and Russia surged in the run-up to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine despite the subduing effects of the pandemic on economic growth, data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) showed on Monday. The war in Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation"", has forced a rapid rethink in Europe over defence strategies and led a string of countries to promise large increases in military budgets. It has also paved the way for a potential expansion of NATO military alliance to include Finland and Sweden. The biggest effect of increased military budgets is likely to be visible in the coming years, but spending was already on the rise in 2021 amid heightened tensions in the run up to Russia's invasion. Global military spending topped 2 trillion dollars for the first time ever last year, reaching $2,113 billion, up 0.7% from 2020, as expenditure rose for the seventh straight year, the influential defence think tank said. Russia lifted its military outlay by 2.9% in 2021 to $65.9 billion as it built up its forces along the Ukrainian border, SIPRI said. It was the third consecutive year of growth in Russia's military spending, which reached 4.1% of GDP in 2021. ""High oil and gas revenues helped Russia to boost its military spending in 2021,"" Lucie Beraud-Sudreau, Director of SIPRI's Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme, said in a statement. ""Russian military expenditure had been in decline between 2016 and 2019 as a result of low energy prices combined with sanctions in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014."" Russia remained in fifth spot in terms of global military spending, behind the United States, China, India and the United Kingdom. Ukraine spent $5.9 billion on its military in 2021, less than one tenth of Russia's budget, according to SIPRI. Total military spending in Europe amounted to $418 billion and has been rising sharply since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Military budgets rose 3.0% from 2020 and stood 19% higher than in 2012, SIPRI said. That figure is likely to increase sharply as countries like Germany, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden fulfil promises to boost spending to 2% of gross domestic product over the coming years. Missile defence systems, drones and high-tech fighters are high on the shopping list of countries worried about Russia.
