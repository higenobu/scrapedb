1/18/2022,"France’s education minister is facing calls to resign after it emerged he had announced a strict Covid-testing protocol for schools just before the start of the January school term while he was on holiday in Ibiza. As French teachers and parents struggled to prepare children’s return to school amid France’s fifth wave of Covid, Jean-Michel Blanquer had flown to the Spanish island known for its beautiful beaches and party culture for a four-day holiday over the new year, the investigative website Mediapart reported.  The revelation that Blanquer was on holiday in Ibiza at one of the toughest moments for schools and parents has created a public relations disaster for the government. Blanquer was once seen as a close ally of the president Emmanuel Macron but he has come increasingly under fire this month over the many changes to Covid protocols as schools struggled to put in place last-minute testing rules, manage class-closures and find replacements for absent teachers. Teachers and parents unions have called for a second nationwide strike this Thursday after tens of thousands of teachers took part in a one-day strike last week. The strict testing and isolation rules were unveiled by Blanquer in an interview with Le Parisien newspaper published on 2 January, just hours before classes were to resume after the holiday break. Mediapart revealed that the interview had taken place by video from Blanquer’s holiday in Ibiza, from which he flew back on the afternoon of Sunday 2 January in time for the start of the new term the next day. Le Parisien said its journalists had not known the minister’s location. Blanquer was not breaking any laws – there were no Covid restrictions stopping travel to Spain and ministers had been asked to remain in Europe, two hours from Paris. But it has presented the government with an image problem, as political campaigning is under way for the spring presidential election. “There is a real gap between what Ibiza represents and what school staff were going through at that moment just before the start of the school term,” said Guislaine David of the SNUipp-FSU teachers union. She said it would deepen the “already big divide” between the education ministry and teaching staff. Yannick Jadot, presidential candidate for the Green party EELV said that instead of preparing the new school term alongside teachers and parents, Blanquer had had his “feet in the sand”. Jadot called for his resignation, saying: “This degree of contempt and irresponsibility is unacceptable.” Olivier Faure, the Socialist party leader, said it felt like France had returned to the “bling bling” of holidays during the rightwing presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy years, and “at a moment when we were asking everyone to tighten their belts”. Government ministers said Blanquer had been working constantly over the new year period and in permanent contact with his team. He had flown to Ibiza after taking part in the government’s emergency meeting on Covid on 27 December. Gabriel Attal, the government spokesman, said: “The rule on holidays set by the government is that you must be constantly reachable, working on your brief, and I have no reason to think that was not the case for Jean-Michel Blanquer.”",News/World news,Calls for French minister to resign after announcing Covid protocol from Ibiza,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/calls-french-minister-resign-covid-protocol-ibiza-jean-michel-blanquer-schools
1/18/2022,"In theory, nothing on Earth should be easier to make than an Oscar Isaac superhero vehicle. Because he’s Oscar Isaac, for heaven’s sake. Bung him in a muscle suit, give him a quippy script and let him spend 85% of his screen time twinkling for the internet and, bingo, you have a runaway hit on your hands. But real life is complicated, and even the best intentions can result in unforced errors. I guess what I’m trying to say is this: what the hell is going on with Oscar Isaac’s accent in the Moon Knight trailer?  I mean it. Guys, you had a sitter. Slowly but surely, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has spent an entire year laying a carefully constructed path for its Disney+ shows. WandaVision skilfully wove an existing post-Endgame storyline into the medium of television. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier took time to focus on themes that might have got lost in the wham-bam soup of a movie. Loki introduced the concept of the multiverse. Marvel has been careful to hold our hand every step of the way, and Moon Knight was supposed to be the moment where it let go. A new character, based on a relatively obscure comic book, Moon Knight is a mercenary with dissociative identity disorder. Now, based on that description, and knowing who plays him, imagine what Moon Knight’s voice sounds like. Something low and growly, perhaps. Something aloof and cool. No. Because according to the Moon Knight trailer, Moon Knight actually talks like Alan Bennett. Well, almost like Alan Bennett. He sounds like Alan Bennett being played by Dick Van Dyke towards the latter stages of a 48-hour am-dram Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em recital. It is – and please remember that we live in a universe where Don Cheadle, on three separate occasions, played a cockney who sounded as if he’d been given a fatal dose of dental anaesthetic – the most incongruous British accent in the history of filmed media. Marvel, you should have prepared us for this. You’re so good at weaving characters throughout your properties, why didn’t you do it here? Why wasn’t there a scene in No Way Home where Doctor Strange informed Spider-Man of the existence of this mysterious character? “He becomes a hero in his sleep,” he could say. “Woah, like a werewolf?” Spider-Man could reply. “Sort of, except he sounds a bit like a depressed Teletubby”, Strange could explain. And then we’d all be warmed up for this atrocity. But no. There is not enough space on the internet for me to try and pinpoint exactly what Oscar Isaac’s accent sounds like in the Moon Knight trailer. It sounds like the malnourished cousin of the Churchill nodding dog. It sounds like Alan Partridge impaling his foot on a spike. It sounds like someone cast an evil spell on the 2017 Saturday Night Live Great British Bake Off sketch. It sounds like Jane Horrocks trying to be South African. It sounds like Dominic Raab wetting the bed as a child. It is awful. True, some producers have tried to make Oscar Isaac less sexy in the past. In Drive he was too much of a low-rent baddie to be evil. In X-Men: Apocalypse he was caked in enough prosthetics to render him unidentifiable. And yet all this effort was for nothing. All it takes to make Oscar Isaac unsexy, it turns out, is to give him a voice that sounds like an 18th-century Leicestershire grandmother. Still, I have hope for Moon Knight. Oscar Isaac’s accent has the feel of a classic Marvel bait and switch. Remember, the character he plays has multiple personalities. My guess is that this one – the one that sounds like infant Tom Holland singing Billy Elliott songs on Channel 5 News – is merely the first personality we’ll encounter. By the middle of the opening episode, he’ll be shaken from his dissociative state and we’ll get to hear Oscar Isaac sounding like Oscar Isaac. Maybe I’m wrong, though. Maybe Moon Knight exists purely as a vehicle for Isaac to do all the terrible accents nobody else has ever let him do. Maybe one of his personalities will be Japanese. Maybe one will be Jamaican. Maybe he’ll spend the entire duration of episode three being Michael Jackson. Or maybe we’re really out of luck, and all of his personalities sound like Daphne from Frasier visiting a doctor for constipation. We’ll just have to find out in March.",Arts/Film,Moon Knight: Oscar Isaac’s British accent sounds like Dick Van Dyke doing Alan Bennett,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/18/oscar-isaac-british-accent-moon-knight-marvel
1/18/2022,"Controversial measures including police powers to stop noisy protests could be brought back to the Commons by the government after a series of late-night defeats in the Lords, the justice secretary, Dominic Raab, has said. Peers rejected a raft of measures in the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill that were proposed in response to activist movements such as Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion. The bill will return to the Commons for MPs to decide whether to accept the changes.  Proposed powers that were voted down included allowing police officers to stop and search anyone at a protest “without suspicion” for items used to prevent a person being moved, known as “locking-on”. A move that would allow individuals with a history of causing serious disruption to be banned by the courts from attending certain protests was also dismissed, along with a proposal to make it an offence for a person to disrupt the operation of key national infrastructure, including airports and newspaper printers. In a separate defeat, peers backed restricting the imposition of tougher sentences for blocking a highway to major routes and motorways rather than all roads. Asked if any measures would be reintroduced through the Commons, the justice secretary told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’ll look very carefully at all of that, but, yes, absolutely. “In relation to noise, of course we support the right to peaceful and rambunctious protest, but it cannot be allowed to interfere with the lives of the law-abiding majority.” Rejection of the Conservative government’s plans sets the stage for a protracted “ping-pong” parliamentary tussle, whereby legislation passes between the Lords and the Commons until agreement can be reached. Peers were strongly critical of not only the measures, but also the way they had been introduced at such a late stage of the passage of the bill, after it had already gone through the elected house. Earlier, the Lords also defeated other contentious curbs on demonstrations proposed in the legislation, including powers to impose conditions on protests judged to be too noisy. The Labour frontbencher Richard Rosser said the “sweeping, significant and further controversial powers” had not been considered by the Commons and called it an “outrageous way to legislate”. Lord Rosser said: “We cannot support any of these last-minute, rushed and ill-thought-through broad powers … with the exception of approving the increased sentences for wilfully obstructing motorways and major roads.” The independent crossbencher and prominent QC Alex Carlile, who served previously as independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said: “The dilution of without-suspicion stop and search powers is a menacing and dangerous measure.” Brian Paddick, a Liberal Democrat peer who was a deputy assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police, said: “If the government is determined to bring in these draconian, anti-democratic laws, reminiscent of cold war eastern bloc police states, they should withdraw them now and introduce them as a separate bill to allow the democratically elected house time to properly consider them.” Lord Paddick added: “The anti-protest measures in the original bill were dreadful. These measures and the way they have been introduced are outrageous.” Stressing the need for the protest measures, the Home Office minister Susan Williams argued they were “vitally important in protecting the country from the highly disruptive tactics employed by a small number of people”. Lady Williams said: “The rights to freedom of speech and assembly are a cornerstone of our democracy and this government will not shrink from defending them. “But a responsible government, one that stands up for the rule of law, must also defend the rights and freedom of the law-abiding majority.” Greenpeace UK’s political campaigner, Megan Randles, said that nationwide protests against the bill had played a part in stopping curbs on the right to protest. “It’s so fitting that the many protests staged over the past few days against these outrageous attempts to remove our right to protest played such a key role in defeating the government last night. There couldn’t be a clearer demonstration of why removing these oppressive amendments was so important,” she said.",News/UK news,Curbs on ‘noisy protests’ may return to Commons after Lords defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/curbs-on-noisy-protests-may-return-to-commons-after-lords-defeat
1/18/2022,"Shrewsbury have banned two people from all games for a total of eight years following events surrounding their FA Cup match with Liverpool earlier this month. Video clips emerged after the third-round tie at Anfield on 9 January appearing to show some Shrewsbury supporters singing a song about the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, in which 97 Liverpool supporters died.  The Shrewsbury goalkeeper Harry Burgoyne tweeted his condemnation of the fans after Liverpool’s 4-1 victory and called for them to be identified and banned. The League One club issued a statement a day later saying they were “disgusted and appalled” to see and hear the reports on social media and were liaising with police to identify the offenders. In a new statement on Tuesday, Shrewsbury said: “As part of the ongoing investigation into incidents at the Liverpool Emirates FA Cup tie, Shrewsbury Town has today banned two individuals from attending future games for a total of eight years. “As a club we do not condone and will not tolerate any behaviour that breaches our supporter code of conduct and brings our good name into disrepute.”",Sport/Football,Shrewsbury ban two fans for eight years over Hillsborough chants,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/shrewsbury-ban-two-fans-for-eight-years-over-hillsborough-chants
1/18/2022,"Aclub statement when Reading supporters are desperately seeking greater transparency from the hierarchy would ordinarily be greeted with open arms. Only the seven paragraphs published on Saturday – when some fans were on the motorway back from Middlesbrough – posed more questions than answers. Hours after conceding a 95th-minute goal that condemned Reading to a fourth defeat in five matches, the club confirmed Liam Moore had been stripped of the captaincy and the owner, Dai Yongge, effectively offered the under-pressure manager, Veljko Paunovic, the dreaded vote of confidence. It capped a miserable week for Reading, who suffered a record-breaking 7-0 home defeat by Fulham last Tuesday, three days after being dumped out of the FA Cup by sixth-tier Kidderminster. Save for Andy Carroll’s equaliser at Boro and his spectacular disallowed goals against Fulham – an overhead kick and a preposterous chest-and-volley from outside the box – the only reason Reading fans have felt compelled to get off their seats recently is to vent their anger. The bad news is Carroll’s contract expired on Saturday.  “Mr Dai is fully supportive of the manager and his decisions and understanding of the hard few months we have endured both on and off the pitch,” Reading said in a statement that started by saying Moore had made clear his desire to leave in recent months. In 2018 Moore signed a new five-year contract now worth about £35,000 per week, making him one of the club’s highest earners. “Incredibly shocked by the statement,” he said on Instagram, accompanied by 18 face-palm emojis. There has also been infighting among supporters and the fear is the situation could sour further. One win from their past nine matches, coupled with a six-point deduction for breaching the English Football League’s profit and sustainability rules, has left them three points above the Championship relegation zone. The alarming run gives Derby survival hope despite a 21-point deduction. It is a similar story to Derby in that exorbitant spending has been a key factor in Reading’s demise from play-off finalists five years ago to the prospect of lining up in the third tier for the first time since 2002. Reading’s 2019-20 accounts show a wages-to-turnover ratio of 216%. “If they had got to the Premier League, the promised land, as they say, all of these problems would have gone away,” says one source. “Aston Villa managed to get up just in time. The owner has gambled, ploughing money in, but it has backfired.” Home crowds have plummeted and Star (Supporters’ Trust at Reading) asked to urgently bring forward a biannual meeting with the chief executive, Dayong Pang, and finance director, Bryan Stabler, to address a “perceived lack of direction and connection with the fanbase”. The meeting is scheduled for Friday. “We are concerned and worried,” says the Star board member Roger Titford. “Before the situation becomes irretrievable, we need some kind of oomph and change. The fans have to be able to see key characters around the place and relate to them … We have an absent king.” The Chinese owners since May 2017, brother and sister Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li, speak little English and are based in Hong Kong. They previously tried to buy Hull City and owned KSV Roeselare and, until the club ceased to exist, Beijing Renhe. Pang, appointed in November 2020, said Yongge watches every game but “does not like publicity, and much like a lot of owners in football, is reluctant to communicate with supporters directly”. In a recent meeting the club said “thankfully, the manager is a great communicator”. Yongge’s last direct communication with supporters was in November, in a statement that addressed the six-point deduction. He said his “determination to succeed has not diminished but has amplified”. A recent survey of 257 supporters by the podcast The Tilehurst End found that 83.5% wanted to hear from Yongge. People with knowledge of the workings of the club have been left scratching their head at everything from how Reading have allowed key assets such as Omar Richards to leave on free transfers to starting recent games with a teenage midfielder at right-back and a 20-year-old at left-back because both first-choice full-backs are at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana. An injury crisis has not helped but the striker Lucas João, a £5m signing, returned to the squad last weekend. The academy graduate Richards joined Bayern Munich in the summer. Reading received £8m for Michael Olise after Crystal Palace triggered his buyout clause but players such as Joe Rodon, Jarrod Bowen and Ollie Watkins were each sold to Premier League teams by other Championship clubs for at least double that. This summer 13 players are set to be out of contract, including the top scorer, John Swift. “When Nicky Hammond was the director of football we would buy cheap and sell dear,” says Titford. “Now it is the other way around. We bought Sone Aluko and Sam Baldock for the best part of £10m [from Fulham and Brighton in 2017 and 2018 respectively] and they both left on free transfers.” Recruitment is a significant issue. The four-man football board comprises Paunovic, Pang, Stabler and the academy manager Michael Gilkes but sources say the agent Kia Joorabchian has influence in that area. “All of the club’s recruitment seems to go through one person,” claims one agent. Another tells of how his client was approached for the managerial vacancy, only for Reading to lose interest when it became clear that Joorabchian would be sidelined. Questions have been raised about Joorabchian’s influence in the club more generally as sources claim he acts as an informal adviser to the owner. He was described by Pang at a meeting with Star in October as a “personal acquaintance of Mr Dai” although he does not have an official title at Reading and Stabler said Joorabchian had not been paid any money as an agent. Reading have been contacted for comment. Joorabchian said it was false to suggest he has influence at the club. Last season’s seventh place looks more of an anomaly by the day. This week is pivotal with home games against Luton and Huddersfield on Wednesday and Saturday respectively. The owners have invested substantially in players and staff – Paunovic is their fifth manager in less than four years – and in a £50m training facility because of their craving for success. Now they badly need points.",Sport/Football,‘We are worried’: how Reading hit crisis point on and off the pitch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/jan/18/how-reading-hit-crisis-point-on-and-off-the-pitch-championship
1/18/2022,"A cursory glance at the latest jobs market figures suggests the economy was in good health as the end of 2021 came into sight. In the three months to November employment rose by 60,000 and the unemployment rate decreased by 0.4 percentage points on the quarter to 4.1%.  The redundancy rate dropped to a record low, revealing a smooth transition out of the furlough scheme and a good deal of luck for a chancellor constantly betting that the effects of the pandemic would be short-lived. Put the unemployment and redundancy rate together and there is only a whisker of difference with the pre-pandemic level in February 2020. Wages tell a different story. While total pay including bonuses edged up 0.4 percentage points to 4.2% on the previous month, without bonuses pay remained static. Once inflation was taken into account wages went into reverse in real terms, declining by 0.9%, even when bonuses are included. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said this squeeze on pay was the third in a decade, after real wage falls after the financial crisis between 2011 and 2014 and in the year after the 2016 Brexit vote. Like previous episodes, the current hit to the average worker’s standard of living is unlikely to prove short-lived as energy, food and fuel price rises eat into household finances. It started last summer, said the thinktank’s economists, and “is likely to get deeper in the coming months with inflation forecast to peak at 6% in April, before it starts to ease in the second half of 2022”. Rishi Sunak will comfort himself with data on PAYE earnings from HMRC for December that showed few signs that the Omicron variant had a big impact, despite concerns that its emergence would provoke a fresh wave of life-threatening sickness. To some extent, the gains in the PAYE data merely reflect a transfer of workers from self-employment into permanent jobs. Nevertheless, a rise of 184,000 in December was impressive and takes the number of people added to payrolls since February 2020 to 409,000. It appears that employers listened intently to the message from South Africa that Omicron was not as virulent as Delta and continued to respond to rising demand for their goods and services as if the new arrival didn’t exist. However, the rise in payrolled employees disguises the huge number of people, most of them aged over 50, who have quit the jobs market altogether, taking their skills and experience with them. Many will have long Covid, while others have had enough of working and will from now on depend on their property and pensions to give them an income. There are 260,000 more people out of work because of ill health and early retirement than pre-crisis and older women are the largest group of leavers, according to Tony Wilson, the head of the Institute for Employment Studies He said policymakers should not forget the labour market was growing strongly pre-crisis, “so these falls in participation are even worse than they look”. Had pre-crisis trends continued, there would be 1.1 million more people in the labour force. Kitty Ussher, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “The legacy of the pandemic appears to be this rise in economic inactivity.” How does all this shift the Bank of England’s thinking when it sets interest rates next month? Before Christmas the central bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said the prospect of spiralling wage growth and a booming jobs market played a big part in the decision to increase rates to 0.25%. When so much of everyone’s salary will be diverted to paying higher heating bills over the coming year, the MPC might think it can sit on its hands. If inflation needs to be crushed by a hit to incomes, it could be said static wages and rising inflation do their own dirty work without the central bank needing to heap more pain on households by increasing borrowing costs. This is not the way the MPC will interpret events, which is why most analysts still predict an increase in the base rate to 0.5% in February and a rise above 1% by the end of the year.",News/Business,UK faces a pay squeeze – and higher interest rates look likely,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/uk-pay-squeeze-interest-rates-jobs-market
1/18/2022,"Hundreds of care homes in England are providing substandard care to dementia patients, analysis by the Guardian has found. One in five homes specialising in dementia are rated “inadequate” or “requires improvement” by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), inspection reports show. Some pose such a serious risk to people with dementia – including filthy conditions, poor infection control and untrained staff – that inspectors have ordered them to be placed into special measures.  Altogether, 1,636 care homes are failing patients in findings described by charities and campaigners as “appalling”. They said urgent action was needed to tackle the “unacceptable” state of dementia care across the country. Of 7,589 care homes registered in England with a dementia specialism, 153 are classed as “inadequate” and 1,483 as “requires improvement”, the analysis of official data for December shows. There are 5,413 rated “good” and 307 “outstanding”. A further 232 had no rating. Zoe Campbell, the director of operations at the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “It’s appalling to hear that one in five care homes specialising in dementia are delivering substandard care. Every person with dementia deserves to live in a safe, secure place and to be treated with compassion and respect.” Campbell said the revelations meant staff recruitment and dementia training must be prioritised in the government’s social care proposals. In October, the Guardian revealed how a care home boasting of “exceptional personalised care” for dementia patients had been put into special measures after inspectors found residents with faeces under their fingernails, wearing other residents’ clothes and sleeping in dirty bedrooms. Longfield residential home in Blackburn, Lancashire, said its dementia patients “receive the best personalised care”. But when CQC officials made an unannounced visit they were alarmed to discover “undignified” conditions. Staff said they would never put their own relatives in the home, while a manager admitted it appeared people’s feet “hadn’t been washed for months”. Patients at risk of weight loss were not being weighed as frequently as necessary, putting them in danger of malnutrition, according to a damning 14-page inspection dossier. Since October, the number of care homes with a dementia specialism in England rated “inadequate” by the CQC has increased, from 143 to 153, and care homes classed as “requires improvement” rose from 1,456 to 1,483. Caroline Abrahams, the charity director at Age UK, said: “Hundreds of thousands of older people with advanced dementia live in care homes, and while each and every one of them deserves excellent personalised and compassionate care, we know only some actually get it. “The pandemic has made the situation worse, but the biggest problem of all is the growing staffing crisis in social care. It’s frankly impossible to provide the kind and intensive support that many of these older people need if there aren’t enough staff to go round, or if there’s a lot of churn and consequent reliance on agency workers to plug gaps. “Without one to one help with eating and drinking, for example, there’s a risk of some older people becoming malnourished and dehydrated, jeopardising their underlying health as well as their happiness and wellbeing.” Abrahams said it was an indictment of society “that we are failing so many” dementia patients. “They are fully able to enjoy life, just like you and me, if they receive great care, based on strong relationships and delivered by skilled and confident staff, who are themselves well supported. It’s so sad that as a result of underinvesting in care and failing to nurture the care workforce we are leaving too many of these older people in suboptimal settings, where some just fade away.” At Longfield, inspectors found the laundry room contained a sluice area that was so dirty staff were using a toilet area and a resident’s bedroom as a laundry area instead. A relative of a resident said they discovered their loved one had gone to hospital with faeces under their fingernails, wearing another person’s clothes with holes in and slippers that were too big. Because the care home did not have enough staff to meet people’s needs, it used agency workers who were unreliable and who “didn’t have the appropriate training to look after people”, the CQC found. Longfield said it was under new management and had since made significant improvement. A spokesperson added: “The home implemented a new management system a week prior to inspection and was undergoing significant renovations. The home has been regularly liaising with CQC and Blackburn with Darwen adult social care services.” Judy Downey, the chair of charity the Relatives & Residents Association, said: “No amount of clapping or kind words on the overworked and underpaid workforce is a substitute for training and regular oversight. Unless and until the government commits to mandatory and accredited training and a proper career structure for care workers, nothing will change.” Debbie Ivanova, the CQC’s deputy chief inspector, said the majority of care homes registered to care for people with dementia were providing good, safe care. “However, there are sadly some instances where our inspectors have found care so poor that we needed to take action to protect people. “Earlier this year at Longfield residential home, Blackburn, inspectors found such poor hygiene and infection control standards that we placed the home into special measures. “These examples are shocking but we want to provide reassurance – firstly, that most providers are rated good or outstanding and secondly, that where we have concerns about care we will inspect and will act to protect people if necessary. If anyone has concerns about care, they should contact us.”",News/Society,Hundreds of dementia care homes found to be substandard in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/18/hundreds-dementia-care-homes-substandard-england
1/18/2022,"When climbers die on the mountains leaving young families behind, they are frequently criticised for putting themselves in harm’s way. How could they be so selfish? That question feels judgmental to me, cruel even. But the person asking it in this National Geographic documentary is director Max Lowe, who was 10 in 1999 when his pioneering climber dad Alex Lowe was buried under an avalanche in Tibet. His body was not discovered until nearly 17 years later. His film is an emotional, tender and painful love letter to his father and family. Max’s mum is Jenni, an artist who was left a young widow with three small boys when her husband died. She’s emotionally rock-solid, raising her sons as a tight unit. When she first started dating Lowe, she didn’t expect it to last. “He was a wild thing.” Long pause, then a confession. “That’s what I loved about him.” Lowe was rugged, good-looking, incredibly charismatic. The couple married, moved to Montana, had children. But he struggled to balance family life and climbing. Talking about that final expedition, Jenni says: “You couldn’t question his love for our family, but he chose to be there.” She doesn’t let him off the hook.  Max’s brothers Sam and Isaac were seven and three when their dad died; they don’t have any solid memories of him. The loss shaped them. How can you walk in the footsteps of a man you hero-worship but don’t remember, who wasn’t around to show you how to be a man? Lowe’s best friend and climbing partner Conrad Anker, who was injured in the accident, talks about being wracked with survivor’s guilt. There’s an emotional twist in the story: something that happened in the family after Lowe died. I’m glad I didn’t know before watching. Because, in its own way, this film is as gripping and absorbing as any documentary about the thrills ascending a north face. One of its pleasures is that everyone here is thoroughly decent, with a real story to tell.

1/18/2022,"“Anxiety” has been chosen by children as their word of the year for 2021, according to new research from Oxford University Press – but teachers have plumped for “resilience”. OUP’s academics have analysed the evolution of children’s language, and how they use it to reflect their emotions and experiences, for more than a decade. They draw from the largest children’s English language corpus in the world, the Oxford Children’s Corpus. This year, they chose to focus on wellbeing as their research focus, given the impact of Covid-19 on education, and concerns about children’s mental health.  OUP surveyed more than 8,000 children aged between seven and 14, from 85 UK schools, asking them to select the top words they would use when discussing health and wellbeing. While “anxiety” came in top, chosen by 21% of children, it was followed by “challenging”, chosen by 19%, “isolate” (14%), “wellbeing” (13%) and “resilience” (12%). The teachers were also asked for the word they used most often when talking to their pupils about health and wellbeing. “Resilience” was their top choice, named by 31%, followed by “challenging” (19%) and “wellbeing” (18%). The Children’s Society’s executive director of social impact, Joe Jenkins, said it was “concerning” that anxiety had been chosen as the No 1 word, but not surprising, “when you consider all the restrictions and changes children had to endure”. He pointed to the Society’s Good Childhood Report from last year, which found that while most children showed “great resilience”, 8% of 10-to-17-year-olds reported that they had coped less well with the changes to life. “Having conversations and using the right language is incredibly important when supporting children if they are feeling anxious, isolated or going through tough challenges, and it’s also crucial children are able to express how they are feeling,” he said. OUP’s director of early childhood and home education, Helen Freeman, agreed. “The findings demonstrate the role we all play in making sure children have the words they need to be able to express themselves and that, as adults, we are aware the language we use around children can significantly influence their learning and wellbeing,” she said. The Oxford English Dictionary chose “vax” as its overall word of the year, saying that it had “injected itself into the bloodstream of the English language” during the pandemic.",Arts/Books,UK children pick ‘anxiety’ as their word of 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/18/uk-children-pick-anxiety-as-their-word-of-2021

But this is a fairytale grounded in modern-day reality. Jack lives with his mum in “an ordinary house on an ordinary street” in Scarborough. The cow is a battered old black-and-white bicycle (albeit with tail and ears) that he intends to trade at Cash Converters. He’s conned by the school bully into swapping it for a magic beanbag and the stalk springs up right in his back garden.  Hilda likes the idea of giving her own bike ears and a tail but she says it’s not quite as fun as the super-long cow Daisy, played by socially distanced actors in Coventry Belgrade’s 2020 panto film, which she loved. “Is this one a musical or a panto?” she asks early on. That’s not just because of the frequency of Simon Slater’s songs – which efficiently drive the story and flesh out the characters – but also an initial shortage of truly delirious silliness. Happily, this is remedied by Jack’s trip up the beanstalk with a mysterious new friend, Jill. He meets a flamenco-loving hen (pluckily played by Alicia Mckenzie) who sports a fake moustache and waistcoat with gold lamé trim, which is pleasingly random in the traditional panto style. Designer Helen Coyston has a nice line in trousers: Jill’s are decorated with clouds befitting their journey into the skies, while Jack sports end-of-the-pier stripes. Props are stashed around the set in bean-shaped boxes and the stalk shoots up around a playground-type structure complete with a slide that will entice younger viewers. Hilda likes that Jack is the same age as her, but detects that Jacob Butler, in the five-strong, all-adult cast, is “quite tall for an eight-year-old”. The story is told with chapter titles shouted out by Butler (“Four: Everything Goes Bonkers!”) and the weather has a supporting role that recalls Slater and Lane’s The Snow Queen. There are plenty of nice, off-the-wall touches: Jack’s mum has an irrational fear of hippos, duplicitous bully Danny (well played by Loris Scarpa) is the headteacher’s son – “he pretends to be nice!” mutters Hilda, outraged – and there are fears that the Giant has eaten the Easter Bunny and that Santa might be gobbled up next. The bond between Butler and Jessica Dennis (as Jack’s mum) is tender but never over-sentimental and Hilda loves Sheri Lineham’s performance as Jill. If it’s a little strange to quietly watch the call-and-response of panto at the desktop, just the two of us, the in-the-round theatre’s audience are present in most shots and gamely cheer when required, helping to make this a winter warmer.

1/18/2022,"The funeral of the 23-year-old teacher Ashling Murphy is taking place in Ireland as neighbours spoke of a “blackness” that had descended on the rural townland where she was killed last week. Outside the church in Mount Bolus in County Offaly there was a sense of profound sadness and bewilderment as friends, family and pupils gathered to pay their respects in a community convulsed by her death.  “There are only four houses between us and the Murphys,” said Paul Carroll. “There is a terrible sense of distraughtness everywhere. It’s like a blackness around us.” His son, Ultan, a banjo player, played music with Murphy, a talented fiddle player. “I am completely shocked,” said the 17-year-old. “I couldn’t believe it for two days. You hear about bad things but you never think it’s going to happen here.” Ultan is one of 200 players expected to answer a call on Monday night by Murphy’s sister Amy for local musicians to arrive at the church with their instruments and to play at the cemetery where Murphy will be buried after midday. Thousands are expected to pay their respects, and a large screen has been erected in the local community centre next to the church to accommodate the crowds. All along the approach roads to the village are shrines with candles, flowers and photos of Murphy, who was attacked while jogging along a canal path after school last Wednesday. Irish police are continuing to hunt for the killer. Her parents, Raymond and Kathleen, sister, Amy, brother, Cathal and boyfriend, Ryan, will be among the mourners while many of her many friends from school, college, her local GAA club Kilcormac/Killoughey and musicians from Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann will also be in attendance. The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, and the justice minister, Helen McEntee, will also attend. Teachers and pupils from Coolanarney national school in Blueball, where she went to school, will form a guard of honour. Outside the church, Rosemary Bracken of the local music group Ballyboy Comhaltas said: “It is something that is going to be written into our history, that we never thought would be – the horrendous death of a young person at the deliberate hand of a stranger. “We have dealt with tragedy here before, car accidents, deaths, but we have struggled with this. People just can’t process it.” Among those arriving with musical instruments were children who had been taught by Ashling. “The children, her pupils are very cut up,” said Catherine Buckley, a member the Comhaltas. “How do you explain to them what has happened?” “We line up our children for many things, for music competitions, for fleadhs [festivals], for St Patrick’s Day but we never thought we would be lining up our children for something like this,” said Bracken, who was organising the musicians at the cemetery.

Hundreds already on the streets here. pic.twitter.com/XTv6GCP7n9 Friends and campaigners are hoping that Murphy’s death will lead to a minister appointed specifically for issues relating to domestic, sexual and gender violence. Mary McDermott, the chief executive of Safe Ireland, said she hoped it would be a “catalysing” moment. Louise Lovett, the chair of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, told RTÉ on Tuesday she hoped it would be a “watershed”. She said she sensed that Murphy’s death would be talked about for weeks and months to come and would heighten the pressure on the government to act. Murphy will be laid to rest in Lowertown cemetery, following the funeral mass.",News/World news,Ashling Murphy: crowds gather for funeral of teacher killed in Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/ashling-murphy-crowds-gather-for-funeral-of-teacher-in-ireland
