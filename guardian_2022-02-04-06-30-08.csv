2/4/2022,"Manchester City will have the chance to seal a fourth Continental League Cup triumph against the holders, Chelsea, following this schooling of Tottenham. The star act was Lauren Hemp, who scored the third and whose ability to glide across the turf was matched by a killer end product. Gareth Taylor should enjoy the challenge of plotting to take down Emma Hayes’s team following his side’s sticky start to the campaign. Chelsea may have claimed the trophy for the past two years but the three-times winners are stylish and able to land dizzying punches when required, so the showpiece at Plough Lane may be a spectacle to savour.  City enjoyed an early ascendancy that had those in white chasing the ball. A Georgia Stanway corner that was taken short – and wasted – was followed by Hemp’s mazy run that took her infield from the left and had Becky Spencer grateful to clutch the shot in her gloves. Then Khadija Shaw drove along an inside channel. Her effort did beat Spencer but not the goalkeeper’s left post. While City had control, too many errant passes showed their concentration required tightening. There was a concerning lapse when a defence led by Alex Greenwood – chosen as captain in the absence of the injured Steph Houghton – allowed Jessica Naz to skate through the middle. Ellie Roebuck, making a first home appearance of the season due to injury, advanced and Naz unloaded, but her radar was also awry and City escaped going behind. Jess Park did not make the same mistake. The attacker’s blistering pace helped her zigzag toward the area, and the finish that beat Spencer low into the right corner was just as impressive. So, too, was City’s second strike a little later. Hemp again dazzled, her pace splitting the Spurs rearguard before her layoff was hit instantly by Caroline Weir: Spencer beat it away, the ball was turned back in by Park, and Shaw swept home. Rehanne Skinner’s side were bamboozled. On the flanks, Hemp and Park tore holes in Ashleigh Neville and Kerys Harrop, Shaw was a battering ram at centre-forward, and Keira Walsh and Stanway’s silky scheming provided the creativity. Shaw was also fleet-minded, occasionally dropping into pockets to allow Weir to be a ghost No 9, running in behind. City appeared what they were: a side who last lost in mid-November, Taylor steadying a team that were defeated in four of their opening seven outings. Their visitors had arrived a place higher – fourth – in the WSL but still felt like the marginal underdogs, despite winning here in the league in September. By the break there seemed scant chance of a repeat. The superb Hemp’s chip nearly made it 3-0, before the same player’s cross was met by Shaw, who skidded the ball off the bar. Spurs were yet to truly make an impact on the semi-final. A sighting of Lucy Bronze shaping a low parabola at Spencer was not the best sign this might change. Neither, too, was Ruby Mace’s thudding pass along the right which Park scampered on to and looped in a ball that defeated Spencer, the bar again thwarting City. With the game compressed more or less in Tottenham’s defensive third the tie had become a stroll for City, which was great news for Taylor and the poorest for Skinner. A third for the home team seemed a mere formality whenever they fancied. While there was no dice when Stanway’s fiercely struck corner caused Stokes to slam a header off Spencer’s left post, it would surely not be long. Weir’s slippery movement threatened twice when she took aim. Finally, the clincher arrived via a sweet sequence. Bronze fed Park who ran down the right and lifted in the ball: up rose Hemp in majestic fashion to head past Spencer. After that, the victors peppered Tottenham and retained the ball easily. The message to Chelsea is clear: beware of City.",Sport/Football,Hemp hits heights as Manchester City beat Spurs to reach League Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/manchester-city-tottenham-womens-league-cup-semi-final-match-report
