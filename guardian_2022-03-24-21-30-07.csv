3/24/2022,"P&O Ferries chose to sack 800 workers without consultation because “no union could accept our proposals”, the firm’s boss has admitted. Peter Hebblethwaite told a Commons hearing on Thursday into last week’s firings that the firm was halving its costs under a “new operating model”, where international seafarers would be paid less than minimum wage. The P&O chief executive said: “There is absolutely no doubt we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to … and we will compensate every one in full for that. “It was our assessment that the change was of such magnitude that no union could accept our proposals.” Earlier, legal experts said P&O should have notified their ships’ flag states in Cyprus, Bermuda and the Bahamas between 30 and 45 days in advance – rather than on the day. Hebblethwaite said the average sacked seafarer on the previous Jersey contracts was paid £36,000 per year. The replacement crew will receive an hourly rate starting at £5.15. He insisted he was “saving the business”, adding: “I would make this decision again, I’m afraid.” More details to follow…",News/Business,P&O Ferries boss admits firm chose to sack staff without consultation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/po-ferries-boss-says-800-staff-were-sacked-because-no-union-would-accepts-its-plans
3/24/2022,"Taiwan is considering extending compulsory military service for young citizens to a year, its defence minister has said in an apparent reverse of the island’s years-long transition from conscription towards a fully voluntary military. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has reignited debates in Taiwan over the readiness of its defence force for a potential invasion by China, which claims Taiwan as a province it must at some point “retake”. Taiwan’s government has been growing defence spending and has increased its weapons procurement from the US, but at the same time has been trying to transition its defence force to an entirely voluntary membership and address long-running issues with training and resources. On Wednesday, Taiwan’s defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, said the current system of four months’ mandatory training was “inadequate” in the event of a conflict, and that the department would review and report on a proposal for extension. Chiu said any implementation would be a year later, and the changes would not happen quickly. He also flagged consideration of expanding conscription to women. After Japanese ceded colonial rule over Taiwan and it came under the governance of the Kuomintang, Taiwan enforced compulsory service of two to three years throughout the decades of martial law, which ended in the late 1980s, and beyond to 2006. Over the next three years it was reduced to one year and the voluntary service was expanded. Since 2013, every male over 18 has been required to complete four months of training service in the military, in a supporting role to the mostly voluntary force. The four months, often derided as a “summer camp”, include about five weeks of basic training, and participants can deduct time if they have done training classes with school or college. They become reservists at the end of the four months. Despite major weapons purchases and increases in budgets, issues with Taiwan’s armed forces are well documented, with insufficient recruitment levels concentrated in key frontline sectors and major concerns about the skill levels of reservists. Observers have drawn parallels between the war in Ukraine and Taiwan’s situation, and raised concerns over the close relationship between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Xi and the Chinese Communist party government have refused to condemn Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. While noting there are major differences in the situation, Taiwan’s government has moved to address concerns, including a heavily promoted increase in reservist training from five days every two years to two weeks every four years, according to Taiwan’s public broadcaster. Today I went to support our reservists & see our new military reserve training for myself. Facing a growing authoritarian threat, the people of #Taiwan are committed to defending our nation & way of life. pic.twitter.com/eZgQggukXk Re-extending the mandatory service to one year would be likely to have public support, according to recent polling by the Taiwanese Public Opinion Foundation, which last week found 75.9% of respondents saying that it should be lengthened to one year in order to improve Taiwan’s defences against Chinese aggression. The debate also includes growing calls for improved civilian readiness in the areas of emergency response, hostile first aid, and guerilla warfare. The government has said it will prepare civilian handbooks on evacuation and response drills, and on Wednesday Chiu also announced the annual civilian emergency drills in May – which usually test earthquake responses – would include a simulated missile attack. Taiwan’s presidential office told Reuters the defence ministry was considering everyone’s views, but that nothing was finalised. It added that training content needed to be reformed to better answer the needs of modern warfare.

3/24/2022,"Nato leaders are meeting for an emergency summit in Brussels today to address the war in Ukraine. While there, they must discuss and agree on how to respond in the event of further escalation from Russia. In the best case, clarifying Nato’s response to further escalation will deter Vladimir Putin from taking that step. At the very least, it will prepare the allies for what may follow. Having failed to quickly oust the elected government in Kyiv, Putin now faces a choice between negotiating an end to the war, or escalating further. While talks are ongoing, Putin himself has given no indication that he’ll settle for anything less than Ukraine’s complete subjugation. Two weeks ago, CIA director William Burns told Congress that the Russian leader is “likely to double down”. He will “try to grind down the Ukrainian military with no regard for civilian casualties”. Putin could ramp up the war in many ways – from a deliberate decision to widen the war against Nato, to an attack on allied territory from a stray missile, to using chemical or biological agents or even a nuclear weapon. How should Nato respond to any of these scenarios? A deliberate attack on a member of Nato is unlikely because the allies have made clear they would defend “every inch” of Nato territory. An attack on Nato would mean war – and given the state of its armed forces, it would be a war Russia would be likely to lose. The other forms of escalation would require a more calibrated response. The possibility of a missile hitting Nato territory was underscored when Russia attacked a target just miles from the Polish border. What if the missile had landed in Poland instead? Nato could counter such escalation by taking out the launcher or aircraft that sent the missile. Though risky, such a proportionate response would leave the onus to escalate further on Putin. The use of chemical or biological agents would be a different story. US officials have repeatedly warned that false Russian accusations about Ukrainian chemical weapons and bioweapons labs may constitute a pretext for Moscow to use these weapons and blame Ukraine. How Nato responds should depend on the circumstances. Russia could bomb an industrial chemical or biological research facility and blame the resulting damage on Ukraine. It has already targeted an ammonia storage facility. Other such attacks could cause hundreds or even thousands of casualties, depending on the location, weather, and other conditions. Nato could not let such an escalation go unanswered. At the very least, it should take out the forces responsible for bombing the facilities with surgical strikes. The US, Europe, and other countries would also need to tighten economic sanctions – for example, banning imports of all Russian goods or denying all Russian banks access to the Swift banking system. Moscow, no doubt, would blame any release of chemical or biological agents on Ukraine, and could use those false claims to escalate further. This could include using industrial chemical agents such as chlorine or ammonia to target civilians, as happened repeatedly in Syria, with planes and helicopters dumping barrels full of chemicals on civilians below. Nato would have to respond to such barbarism, for example, by imposing a real no-fly zone to prevent further Russian aerial attacks. Of course, deploying Nato aircraft into a war zone would require attacking Russian aircraft and air defences threatening Nato planes. But that would be an appropriate response to Russia’s deliberate escalation. Though less likely, Russia might decide to use actual chemical weapons (such as mustard gas or sarin nerve agents), biological agents, or even a nuclear weapon. After all, Russian military doctrine foresees the possibility of escalating a conflict to convince the other side to back down. And Putin’s determination to win makes using any of these weapons a conceivable option. Though a Nato response would risk even further escalation, not responding would risk the future credibility of Nato and its capacity to deter. An effective response need not include responding in kind nor require a full-on war against Russia. But if Russia uses chemical or biological agents, let alone a nuclear weapon, Nato should come to the direct defence of Ukraine – deploying its air, ground and naval forces to ensure Russia’s defeat and the full restoration of Ukraine’s independence and sovereignty. No one wants to start world war three. But Putin should know that if he escalates, Nato’s calculation of risks and rewards will change. Letting Moscow know that Nato would come to Ukraine’s direct defence under these circumstances would not only be legal and legitimate, but necessary to demonstrate to Russia and others that escalation does not pay.

3/24/2022,"Stadium Australia has been the site for many of the Socceroos’ most celebrated moments. Be it Josh Kennedy’s towering header to defeat Iraq and secure progression to the 2014 World Cup or Mile Jedinak’s captain’s hat-trick against Honduras in the 2018 World Cup qualification playoffs. Or, of course, John Aloisi’s famous penalty that dispatched Uruguay and ended the nation’s long, 32-year absence from football’s grandest stage. Stadium Australia has so often proved to be Australian football’s field of dreams. In other words, one could not have picked a better venue for a Socceroos fixture which carried all the hallmarks of a cliched Hollywood epic; an outmanned and outgunned host nation with their backs to the wall fighting to defy the odds in a manner nobody expected them to. Arnold had leaned into the narrative by declaring his side needed to “fight” against their foes, and assistant coach Rene Meulensteen, filling in on pre-match media duties as Arnold completed (another) Covid isolation period, joined in on the bromides when he declared that, more than anything, “courage will win us the game”. It was all very stirring. But courage does not win you football games. Goals do. And on Thursday evening, the Socceroos’ hopes were dashed by Kaoru Mitoma’s 89th-minute strike and subsequent winding run and the 94th-minute sealer that popped out of Mat Ryan’s hand and rolled, slowly, into the back of the net. Perhaps it was fitting that effort, as well as Miki Yamane’s cutback to find Mitoma for his first, seemingly took an age to slowly slide across the wet surface at Stadium Australia. Plenty of time to reflect on a result that has now served to deliver a coup de grâce to the Socceroos’ hopes of automatic qualification for the World Cup that, almost as part of a collective coping exercise, had long since been discarded by the majority of the 41,852 fans who had made their way to Homebush. Though controversy will dog the decision to disallow a 25th-minute own goal which would have given Australia the lead for a foul on goalkeeper Shūichi Gonda, it was indicative that the hosts only really looked capable of doing any damage from set pieces. On another night, perhaps one in which Takumi Minamino has his radar on, the Japanese could have had another four or five. Australia started looking devoid of ideas and, by the end of the contest, had exhausted even those. Regardless of what the Socceroos are able to accomplish in Saudi Arabia next week, they will be forced to qualify for a fifth straight World Cup through the gauntlet of the Asian and then the intercontinental playoff. It was a path they also had to tread to qualify for the 2018 tournament in Russia. Unlike that campaign, though, it will not be a two-legged playoff against a North or Central American nation that awaits them but, instead, a one-legged, do-or-die clash against a country from the powerhouse that is South America. Conmebol’s playoffs will also end in the coming days but, as it presently stands, that opponent would be 2018 World Cup opponents Peru. Or perhaps it will currently be sixth-placed Chile or even, just to add to the whole strangely scripted vibe the Socceroos campaign has come to possess, old foes Uruguay. Before then, however, they will need to defeat the third-placed finisher from Asia’s other qualifying group – presently the United Arab Emirates – and that in and of itself will be no sure thing. But whoever they face, they will certainly need to fashion some sort of inspiration. As while Japan can’t be said to have played free-flowing, swashbuckling football, they were still able to win more territory and create more chances than their counterparts. The Socceroos were, it must be acknowledged, heavily undermanned, but that alone cannot explain away Thursday night’s uninspiring performance.",Sport/Football,Socceroos consigned to playoffs as Japan secure World Cup berth with win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/socceroos-fail-to-secure-automatic-world-cup-qualification-with-defeat-to-japan
3/24/2022,"The Sun recorded a loss of £51m last year as the pandemic and a shift of advertising spend online hurt its newspapers, while its parent company sought to end the phone hacking legal cases that have cost it hundreds of millions of pounds over the past 15 years. Rupert Murdoch’s News Group Newspapers, which publishes the Sun and retains liability for the activities of the defunct News of the World, spent £49m on legal fees and damages relating to historical phone-hacking allegations in the year to 27 June 2021. This compares with the £80m NGN spent the previous year. The financial filings show the unnamed highest-paid director of NGN – most likely Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of parent company News UK – received a 50% increase in remuneration last year to £3.6m. On Thursday, NGN is beginning a two-day hearing at the high court in an attempt to bring an end to the ongoing managed hearings where new potential claimants start legal action each year. There have been hundreds of cases lodged over the past 15 years – in December NGN agreed a substantial settlement with the actor Sienna Miller to ensure her hacking claims did not go to trial – with lawyers saying there could still be thousands of potential victims still to come forward. In terms of the Sun’s financial performance, the company said that turnover fell from £324m to £318.6m in the last year. The company said digital advertising and “other customer revenues”, including its betting and gaming operations, were able to “partly offset the losses in print”. “The decrease in turnover was primarily due to adverse print market conditions exacerbated by the pandemic, particularly in Monday to Friday sales, though performance has continued to improve since the first lockdown and throughout the financial year,” the company said, in its filing to Companies House. “There were declines in both newspaper circulation and print advertising revenues owing to an industry-wide acceleration in the shift in spend towards online.” The scale of the challenge facing publishers was made clear earlier this month when Reach, the owner of the Daily Mirror and Daily Express as well as hundreds of regional brands, saw its market value plunge by a quarter as it warned of significant cost increases. Reach said that the existing issue of rising newsprint costs, due to growing distribution costs and supply issues, was now being exacerbated by soaring energy prices. NGN, which employed an average of 543 editorial staff last year, reported a total wage bill of £42.5m. The subsidiaries three directors, including News UK chief operating officer David Dinsmore, were paid a combined £6.7m, up from £4.5m in 2020. Last June, it emerged that Rupert Murdoch had written down the value of the Sun newspapers to zero. And last year, in a piece of Fleet Street symbolism, the Sun lost its title of UK’s bestselling newspaper to the Daily Mail; it had been the nation’s most popular paper since 1978.",News/Media,The Sun records £51m loss as publisher fights costly phone-hacking cases,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/24/the-sun-records-51m-loss-as-publisher-fights-costly-phone-hacking-cases
3/24/2022,"Britain’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic is being put at risk by the escalating price pressures and blow to business confidence caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the latest snapshot of the economy has shown. The flash estimate of activity from S&P Global and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) found the UK’s service sector growing rapidly but optimism about the future at its weakest in almost 18 months. The service and manufacturing sectors expanded in March, according to the survey of purchasing managers, but while the former put in its strongest performance for nine months, factories had their toughest time since the lockdown of early 2021. S&P Global and the Cips said its measure of service sector activity rose from 60.5 to 61.0 in March, while the manufacturing PMI dropped from 58.0 to 55.5. Any reading above 50 suggests the sector is expanding. Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&P Global, said: “The UK PMI surveys indicated a sustained robust pace of expansion in March as the further reopening of the economy from Covid-19 containment measures helped offset headwinds from the Ukraine war, Brexit and rising prices. However, the outlook darkened as concerns over Russia’s invasion exacerbated existing worries over soaring prices, supply chains and slowing economic growth. “Business expectations are now at their lowest for almost one and a half years, pointing to a marked slowing in the pace of economic growth in coming months. “Meanwhile, prices pressures have spiked higher due to increased energy and commodity prices resulting from the invasion. With March seeing by far the largest rise in selling prices for goods and services ever recorded by the survey, consumer price inflation is set to rise further in the months ahead. After official figures this week showed consumer price inflation at its highest level in three decades, the PMI showed the steepest rise in prices charged by businesses since the survey began in November 1999. Escalating inflationary pressures and concerns related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to a slump in business optimism to its lowest since October 2020.",News/Business,UK economic recovery at risk from rising inflation and waning business confidence,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/24/uk-economic-recovery-at-risk-from-rising-inflation-and-waning-business-confidence
3/24/2022,"The first voice you hear on Mikayla Simpson, AKA Koffee’s debut album belongs not to the 22-year-old singer, but to the late Bob Marley. Echoing samples from 1980’s Redemption Song weave around the sparse instrumentation on opener X10. His appearance shouldn’t be taken as some kind of benediction: the Marley estate has never been terribly selective when it comes to promoting the late Tuff Gong’s legacy, slapping his name on everything from skincare products to socks to Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream, and his oeuvre has been sampled and interpolated by everyone from the Beastie Boys to Bad Bunny, but nevertheless, a Jamaican reggae artist opening their album with the sound of Jamaica’s most famous and revered musical figure is quite a ballsy move. Like the lyrical nods to Sister Nancy’s Bam Bam and Althea & Donna’s Uptown Top Ranking on her 2019 EP Rapture, it’s presumably intended to say something about Simpson’s deep connection to reggae’s history. While her teenage friends in Spanish Town tended to like whatever was big at the time, she told Rolling Stone magazine in 2021, she “took to reggae and just made my own path”. Perhaps evoking the biggest crossover reggae star of all says something about the commercial ambitions behind Gifted. Jamaica hasn’t produced a huge mainstream pop star since Sean Paul, whose peak was 20 years ago, but Koffee sounds determined: “Might get caught up in a new wave,” she suggests on the title track, before offering to “chop the track up in a new way if it helps me get a few plays”. Her career has developed a striking momentum. Two years ago, she became the first female artist ever to win the Grammy for best reggae album, despite the fact that Rapture clearly wasn’t an album: whichever way you sliced it, it was a distinct improvement on the previous year, when the Grammys deemed the best reggae album a collaborative work by Sting and Shaggy. She has been the recipient of a succession of high-profile co-signs: from Harry Styles, who asked her to support him on tour; to John Legend, on whose 2020 album Bigger Love she appeared; to Jay-Z, who tapped her to perform the theme song to the acclaimed western The Harder They Fall. Rumours abound that she’s working with Rihanna on the latter’s forthcoming reggae album: certainly, the singer’s beauty brand Fenty gets a namecheck among the torrent of high-end labels mentioned in Gifted’s lyrics. In the past, Koffee has talked about the influence of Protoje on her work. If her brand of Rastafarianism and her politicking is noticeably gentler in its approach than that of her idol – you get a light sprinkling of references to Jah and a few snappy lines about gun violence on Gifted – she’s definitely taken on board the eclecticism of the reggae revival movement’s leading light. Gifted covers a lot of musical ground in less than half an hour, from the sweet, harmony-laden lovers rock of Lonely to Shine’s dabbling in the kind of easygoing acoustic reggae beloved of beach bars the world over, albeit underpinned by an immense electronic bass. The brief Defend veers close to trip-hop, and, with J-Hus collaborator Jae5 among the album’s producers, Koffee has a strong line in tracks influenced by Afrobeats: the title track melds a filtered sample of kids singing with a rhythm that shifts from sounding organic, as if it’s being banged out on congas and the body of an acoustic guitar, to fully electronic. At its least inspired, the desire to appeal to a broad audience causes the album to stumble. Run Away is basically homogeneous AutoTune pop with a Jamaican accent. It may do the trick commercially but it undersells Koffee’s individuality. She’s better suited to the brand of laid-back party music that consumes the album’s final tracks. On Pull Up, Jae5’s production occupies a hugely appealing space somewhere between Afrobeats, dancehall and pop: it comes complete with a 1980s soul sax and a hook that’s impossible to dislodge from your brain. As her voice flips from toasting to smooth singing, the lyrics of West Indies evoke Lionel Richie’s All Night Long, with which it shares a certain dusk-settling, party-slowly-starting atmosphere, albeit via entirely different musical means. Lockdown, meanwhile adopts an intriguingly ambiguous attitude to the end of Covid restrictions, Koffee’s desire for freedom tempered by the fear that a romance that’s bloomed over FaceTime may not work out “when di quarantine ting done and everybody touch road”. “Where will we go?” she asks, a line that seems simultaneously goggle-eyed at the thought of getting out and troubled by the prospect of where the relationship is heading. It’s smart and inventive, its sound commercial without doggedly following current trends: everything you might want in a crossover pop star, which Gifted may well make of Koffee.

3/24/2022,"The ruler of Dubai will have no face-to-face contact with his two children from his marriage to Princess Haya nor any substantive say in their upbringing, after a long-running court battle between the former couple and a series of damning judgments about his “abusive behaviour”. Concluding more than two and a half years of legal proceedings, which began when Haya fled to the UK with the children in April 2019, the president of the family division of the high court in England and Wales said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum had “consistently displayed coercive and controlling behaviour with respect to those members of his family who he regards as behaving contrary to his will”. In a written judgment, Sir Andrew McFarlane ruled that Haya would have sole responsibility for decisions relating to the children’s medical care and schooling. He said the Dubai ruler, who is also prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, a close Gulf ally of Britain, had inflicted “domestic abuse” on an extraordinary scale against his ex-wife, which had emotionally and psychologically harmed their children and would continue to do so if she were required to gain approval for matters involving their wellbeing. At the outset of proceedings, Sheikh Mohammed had sought the return of Jalila, now 14, and Zayed, now 10, to Dubai. But McFarlane said that since October 2019 the Dubai ruler had accepted that the children would remain living with their mother in England and, on 1 December last year had announced that he would no longer pursue direct contact with them. This change of heart followed damning judgments by McFarlane which determined, on the balance of probabilities, that: Sheikh Mohammed orchestrated the abductions and confinement of two of his other children, Princess Latifa and Princess Shamsa – in the latter case from the streets of Cambridge – and subjected Haya to a campaign of “harassment and intimidation”. He hacked the phones of Haya and five of her associates, including two of her lawyers, using NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware while the couple were locked in court proceedings. His agents attempted to buy a £30m estate next door to Haya’s Berkshire home in a “very significant threat to her security”, while publicly denying they were doing so. In the latest judgment, published on Thursday, McFarlane noted Sheikh Mohammed’s failure to attend or play a part in any of the many court hearings, instead relying on his lawyers, and his “absence of any acceptance of responsibility, expression of remorse or understanding of the impact of this behaviour on the mother” and failure to acknowledge Haya’s good parenting. Describing the co-parenting relationship as “entirely bankrupt”, he wrote: “The children are being harmed by the degree to which their mother is compromised emotionally and in terms of the time and focus she has been able to give to them because of the need to engage with all of the issues that have preoccupied her these last three years, and by the impact that the need constantly to engage with the demands of this court process has had on her. “The harm to the children from all of these factors will, I am clear, continue if she is, in the future, required to communicate with his highness to gain his approval for matters, even serious matters, relating to the children’s health, education or psychological wellbeing.” In oral evidence, Haya, who last year was awarded a potentially record-breaking divorce settlement that could exceed £500m to protect her and their children from the sheikh, said: “To look forward to shared parental responsibility with somebody who cannot even see you as a parent, or bear to mention your name on paper, does not feel like that there is anything shared about it.” McFarlane said a series of legal challenges, including appeals, brought by the sheikh’s lawyers, while legitimate, were a manifestation of a desire to “coerce and control” Haya and prevent or curtail the court’s investigations. He added: “His highness’s behaviour towards the mother, in each of its separate manifestations, whether by threats, poems, coordinating press reports, covertly arranging to purchase property immediately overlooking hers, phone hacking or in the conduct of this litigation, has been abusive to a high, indeed exorbitant, degree.” The result of the judgment is that Sheikh Mohammed will be limited to “indirect contact” with his children, for example by phone or via messaging apps. McFarlane said the explicit naming of children in a welfare judgment appeared to be unprecedented but Haya and Jalila favoured publication and it would “remove the potential for conjecture, manipulation and/or falsehood” by the sheikh or those acting for him with respect to the children’s welfare. In a statement issued on Thursday, Haya thanked the court and her legal team. She said: “The last few years have been a frightening journey and yet the sanctuary, protection and extraordinary compassion we have experienced in England have strengthened our belief in the enduring power of both humanity and justice.” A statement issued on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed said: “He loves his children and cherishes their love for him. He has always cared and provided for them, and always will. He maintains his denial of the allegations made in these contentious proceedings.”",News/World news,Dubai ruler to have no direct contact with two children after UK court battle,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/dubai-ruler-no-direct-contact-with-children-after-uk-court-battle
