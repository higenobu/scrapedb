2/23/2022,"An ex-Trump aide called a meeting between the former president and Ginni Thomas as the ""craziest"" meeting he'd ever attended. Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, is a longtime conservative activist. As Trump sought to court the justice, Ginni Thomas saw her opening, per a NYT Magazine report. An aide to former President Donald Trump described a 2019 White House gathering with the then-president and Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as the ""craziest"" meeting he'd ever attended, according to The New York Times Magazine. Ginni Thomas — an attorney and conservative activist — has been in the political trenches with right-leaning leaders for decades. Her influence is so valued among conservative activists — and Justice Thomas — that she even came to the White House for what was supposed to be a private lunch between Trump and her husband, according to the magazine. Leonard Leo, the former executive vice president of the conservative Federalist Society, told the magazine that Trump sought to cultivate a relationship with Justice Thomas once he realized the immense popularity of the jurist among the Republican base, creating an opening for Ginni Thomas with the then-president. The magazine also detailed newly-reported ties between Ginni Thomas and organizers of a January 6, 2021 rally in support of Trump, along with efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, in which Joe Biden oust the former president in a decisive 306-232 Electoral College victory. According to nine former Trump aides and advisors, who spoke to the magazine anonymously, the ensuing meetings with Ginni Thomas created a sense of confusion among the staffers. Several of the staffers were unsure of Ginni Thomas' role and wondered if she was speaking as an activist or as a paid consultant, while also highlighting her insistence on promoting far-right candidates for positions within the Trump administration, per the magazine. ""Here's what the peeps think,"" she stated in the meetings of the GOP base, according to an aide. ""We have to listen to the peeps."" Ginni Thomas' hard-driving style alienated several of the aides so much that they assembled an opposition report on her, with one of the staffers describing her as a ""wrecking ball."" In January 2019, Ginni Thomas met with Trump at the White House alongside select members of her conservative group, Groundswell, where a Trump aide described the nature of the conversation in unflattering terms. ""It was the craziest meeting I've ever been to,"" he told the magazine. ""She started by leading the prayer."" Later, the aide said that conservative attendees spoke disparagingly of ""the transsexual agenda"" and parents ""chopping off their children's breasts."" According to the aide, Trump ""tried to rein it in"" but ""it was hard to hear"" because members of the group were praying out loud during the conversation. Later, some key details of the White House meeting leaked, and Ginni Thomas' advocacy against transgender rights made headlines. In the past, she has used inflammatory language against transgender Americans, saying the country is under threat by the ""fascist left,"" which she said includes ""transsexual fascists."" In the meeting, Ginni Thomas and other attendees also lamented that several conservative candidates to their liking had been stymied from assuming several roles, while advocating for the Trump administration's personnel office to be swept of ""Never Trump"" Republicans.

2/23/2022,"An Asian couple fell victim to a violent robbery in Oakland’s Little Saigon on Feb. 16.

The incident, which was captured by CCTV, occurred outside a business near Ninth Avenue and International Boulevard at around 1:30 p.m.

The video shows two hooded individuals approaching the couple and forcing them to surrender their valuables. A fifth person, who appears to be homeless, witnesses the entire incident from across the street.

One of the assailants is seen targeting the male victim and searching his pockets. He also punches the man’s head during the struggle and eventually takes his wallet.

The other assailant is seen attempting to swipe the female victim’s purse. He manages to snatch it, and the woman yells, “Give me my ID!”

Seconds later, the assailants trip the male victim. They check his back pockets one last time before reportedly fleeing in a getaway car, which can be heard speeding off in the video.

The owner of the business, who provided the surveillance footage, told ABC7 News anchor Dion Lim that stores in the area and around Chinatown have been closing early due to the “fear that someone is out there.” He said his own mother suffered a similar attack some six or seven years ago.

“There's a lot of lost business and lost income because of that fear that someone is out there, about to take advantage of me. It's sad they have to do that, sad we have to do that,” he said.

Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, said attacks on Asian Americans are happening not only in Chinatown, but in all of Oakland. Last August, he urged Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare a state of emergency in the city.

“The problem is, now they're also using guns. It's getting scarier,” Chan told KTVU.

Chan himself fell victim to an attack last April. “Crime's happening all over, and we must work together, and we must also work with the police department and work as a community to stop this kind of crimes [sic] happening,” he added.

The recent Chinatown incident is under investigation. For now, the owner of the business urges people to take extra precautions.

“You have to know what's around you and be more careful,” he said, according to KTVU. “Don't place your things — don't carry valuables, especially a lot of cash and jewelry.”

2/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin and Russia have ended the Pax Americana by calling what turned out to be America's bluff. The proof? Russian tanks are moving deeper into Ukraine. With the end of the Cold War, the United States promised everyone everything, extending its protection as far east as tiny Lithuania. Sure, little buddy, if that bully Russia ever pulls itself off the canvas, we've got your back… But the U.S. reached out too far, promised too much, and now the bluff is called: The embers of imperial ambition can't protect poor, friendly Ukraine. Once considered the Soviet heartland and breadbasket — at least by the Russians — Ukraine has admittedly played coy over the years. At times, it has leaned West; other times, toward Moscow. Recently, it's been looking for a bit more democracy (and certainly the greater wealth) that comes from cozying up to Western Europe and the United States. While Kyiv hadn't formally asked to join NATO — and NATO hasn't offered — friendly allyship, if not formal alliance, and full integration into Europe were certainly on the table. And Ukraine knows the United States and NATO protect their friends — or at least their aura of resolve does. But now that glow has faded, and as Winston Churchill said, the lights are going out. A major land war has once again grabbed Europe by the throat. For more than 70 years, the United States, through the power of its ideals and ideas — and the threat of overwhelming force — has helped keep the world relatively peaceful and the map's borders largely in place. When you speak about relative peace, unfortunately, you have to compare the years since World War II with all of human history before it. People are still murderous, but far less so than they have ever been. Ministers of war have become defense ministers all over the world. Euphemism? To a certain extent, yes, but also a demonstration of a change in attitudes about the normality of war. We believe peace to be the norm, and wars to be a breach of that peace. Our recent ancestors, on the other hand, saw war as an unfortunate norm and peace to be a nice break. This fundamental change came in the wake of the world's bloodiest war so far, World War II, when Germans and Soviets killed each other at a rate that now is simply unimaginable. Not figurative tens of millions: literal tens of millions. Civilian deaths were also in the tens of millions around the world, including the intricately organized slaughter of the Holocaust, which killed two-thirds of the Jews in Europe. All told, 3 percent of the world died in that one war, culminating with the threat of complete oblivion that became real with the clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The victors divided Europe at Yalta and set up an economic blueprint for the world at Bretton Woods with gold and the U.S. dollar as kings. There were new rules for conducting war and peace, largely guaranteed by the United States and its allies, with the Soviet Union setting up a mirror system of its own. The rules were bent over and over again, with horrible proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, across Africa and Latin America. Even genocide — a concept without a word before the war — has continued, in Cambodia, in China, in Myanmar. But the Cold War was labeled such because the world remembered what a hot war was like, and this wasn't it. The United States wanted to impose imperfect democracy and McDonald's across the globe, and became rich doing so. The Soviets wanted to change human nature and create the ""New Soviet Man."" But the USSR eventually became so riddled with corruption that it could no longer stand — and in 1989, the United States was there to collect all the pieces. By the time the Soviet Union formally dissolved in 1991, the U.S. stood alone with its empire of influence that reached from Russia's doorstep all the way into China's home waters. Empire brings incredible rewards, including cheap gas and other imports, rising living standards, and a defense perimeter that stretches literally thousands of miles from the homeland. It also brings hubris and a sense of absolute power. Discord at home, disinterest in the world abroad, and fatigue from unwinnable wars has changed that. Americans seem to feel the empire is already lost, and a need to retrench. The world is tired of the American act. And sometimes all it takes to start a war is a lack of resolve on the part of the defender. America's bluff has been called. Now the only thing that is certain is a world less stable than it has been for nearly 80 years and the inevitable carnage that will follow.

2/23/2022,"The deputy chair of Russia's security council taunted Europe with higher gas prices on Tuesday. He made the comment after Germany put a stop to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Germany halted the pipeline amid Russia's decision to order troops into eastern Ukraine. A top Russian government official on Tuesday taunted Europe with sky-high gas prices after Germany put a stop to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline amid Russia's decision to order troops into eastern Ukraine. ""German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has issued an order to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline,"" Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president and the deputy chair of Russia's security council, said in a tweet. ""Well. Welcome to the brave new world where Europeans are very soon going to pay €2.000 for 1.000 cubic meters of natural gas!"" he added. Germany on Tuesday scrapped plans for Nord Stream 2 — an undersea pipeline that would carry natural gas from Russia to Europe — in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognizing the independence of two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine. In an interview with CNN, Jonathan Finer, a deputy US national security advisor, described Russia's latest moves as ""the beginning of an invasion"" of Ukraine. Nord Stream 2 is highly controversial; the Ukrainian government and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Washington have opposed it. Critics have contended that Nord Stream 2 would give Russia far too much leverage over Europe. The pipeline also bypasses Ukraine, depriving it of billions in gas transit fees. Nord Stream 2 was not yet operational — it was waiting on German certification. For months Germany had tiptoed around committing to halting the pipeline if Russia took action against Ukraine. But President Joe Biden earlier this month said that if Russia invaded Ukraine there would ""no longer be a Nord Stream 2."" The White House applauded Germany's swift reaction to Russia's actions. Biden ""made clear that if Russia invaded Ukraine, we would act with Germany to ensure Nord Stream 2 does not move forward,"" Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said in a tweet on Tuesday. ""We have been in close consultations with Germany overnight and welcome their announcement. We will be following up with our own measures today.""
