4/15/2022,"One of the sweetest deals going for individual savers – a government-backed, inflation-protected bond -- is about to get sweeter. But already, there are signs the party won’t last forever. Next month, the Treasury Department will reset the rate for its I Bonds. Since their rate is tied to the government inflation index which just came in at 8.5%, analysts say I Bonds are likely to rise to about 9.6% for the next six months, up from the current 7.12%. That’s at a time when the interest on many banks’ checking or short-term savings accounts is unlikely to pass 2%. “Given the current environment of rising rates and inflation, investors are looking to I Bonds to earn significantly more returns on their savings over time,” said Mychal Campos, head of investing at digital investment advisor Betterment. “If you purchase an I Bond in April, you're essentially locking in 7.12% annualized return over the next six months and then another 9.6% of annualized returns in the six months after. So that's a very favorable outcome for the growth of your savings,"" he said. But even though savers are protected from downsides in several ways, they face the prospect that inflation may fall as gasoline prices taper off. If that happens, I Bond rates will fall. I Bonds are a variety of government savings bond. Since they are sold direct to the public at treasurydirect.gov, not through brokerages, they generally don’t attract much attention. Plus, individuals are limited to $10,000 in purchases of I Bonds a year. But as inflation has spiked, the investment has taken on a new luster. Starting next month, the deal that’s already good may only get better. Experts say I Bonds are worth a look. “This is a no-brainer for everyone,” said Ken Tumin, senior industry analyst at LendingTree and founder of LendingTree’s rate tracker Deposit Accounts. He believes the rate will hit 9.62% based on Treasury's formula. He is quick, however, to add an exception: Investors who are just starting to build an emergency fund should not sink all their savings into the I Bond because it can’t be redeemed for the first year. After that, there is a withdrawal penalty of three months of interest for the first five years. “That 3-month penalty isn’t much, but not being able to access your money for 12 months could be an issue if all or most of your emergency fund money is in there,” Tumin said. Remember, too, that the I Bond’s rate will continue to fluctuate based on inflation. It has been as low as 0% for six months in 2015 -- it can't dip below 0% so investors can never lose any of their principal -- but it has gone as high as 10.85% for those who bought I bonds in 2000 and held them ever since. They were created in 1998. ►Closer look: High-ethanol E15 gasoline is cheaper, but is it safe for your car? Some economists forecast inflation rates to fall from their current 40-year high, which would cause future I Bond rates to drop. Much of the inflation announced Tuesday is being blamed on record gasoline prices, which rose more than 18% in March. But fuel prices are since starting to ease with President Joe Biden pledging to tap the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to add to the nation’s oil supply. Used car prices are down a bit, too, though they remained 35% higher in March than the year before. Hence, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard predicted: “The descent in inflation is going to be painfully slow.” How to save: Egg prices are up for Easter and Passover because of bird flu and inflation Will inflation slow down?: After a string of 40-year highs,some economists think so.

4/15/2022,"The main headlines impacting markets lately can be put into three broad categories: US inflation, which remains stubbornly high and shows no signs of slowing, geopolitical matters, mainly the war in Ukraine, and also China’s COVID lockdowns. These are pulling in various, sometimes contradictory, directions, and can make for a confusing investment situation. Observing the market conditions for investment giant JPMorgan, global market strategist Marko Kolanovic believes that investors should keep their portfolios heavy on stocks. ""We retain a pro-risk view and continue to recommend OWs [i.e. Buy positions] in equities... Prior to the Ukraine war, growth was expected to accelerate to well above trend as we reopen from the Omicron wave and see an unleashing of pent-up consumer and corporate demand. Although growth prospects have been downgraded over the past month, much of this impulse remains and we still see supports from strong labor markets, light investor positioning, healthy consumer and corporate balance sheets, easing policy in China, and fiscal supports in several countries to offset part of the drag from high energy prices,"" Kolanovic opined. Following this lead, JPMorgan's stock analysts have been picking out equities which they see as potential winners, with potential to gain 40% or more in the coming months. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to pick up the latest scoop on these picks; here are the details. Silvergate Capital (SI) We’ll start with Silvergate, a California-based commercial bank that has a focus on the digital currency sector. Silvergate serves a wide variety of business customers, including institutional investors, fintech software companies, and digital currency exchanges. The company started shifting to its digital focus back in 2013, after 25 years in banking, and as digital currency has grown, so has Silvergate. The bank currently has over 1,300 clients, and has been profitable for the last 20 years. This mid-cap bank will report its 1Q22 earnings next week, but we can get a feel for its situation with a look back at Q4 and 2021. The bank saw 66 cents per share in net income, down from 88 cents in the prior quarter, but up 40% from 4Q20. Silvergate’s asset base was strong, having grown from $5.5 billion at the end of 2020 to $16 billion at the end of 2021, and the bank boasted an 18% sequential gain in average deposits from digital currency customers, to $13.3 billion. Among the bulls is JPMorgan's Steven Alexopoulos who notes that Silvergate is peculiarly well-suited to thrive as market conditions change. “With all eyes on the Fed’s QT and the rate outlook, as the futures market is implying 10 rate hikes through the end of 2023, asset sensitivity is one of the key criteria that are on bank investors’ radar today. For investors looking to increase exposure to asset sensitive banks, we believe they need not look any further than Silvergate, with the company being the most asset sensitive bank in the US. Silvergate is highly levered to rising short-term rates, with its net interest income projected to increase 60% for a 100 bp+ parallel shock in interest rates,” Alexopoulos explained. In light of these comments, Alexopoulos rates SI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $200 price target suggests it has an impressive one-year upside potential of ~59%. (To watch Alexopoulos’ track record, click here) It's clear from the 8 unanimously positive analyst reviews on this stock that Wall Street is in broad agreement with the bulls here – and gives SI a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. SI shares are trading for $126, and their $201.13 average target neatly matches the JPM view. (See SI stock forecast on TipRanks) Sprinklr (CXM) The next JPM pick we're looking at is Sprinklr, an experience management firm, offering business customers a SaaS platform to unify electronic communications – voice calls and messaging, emails, and live chat – through an AI-enabled engine. The firm is a tech unicorn, valued at approximately $2.7 billion before its IPO in June of last year. While the stock is down 22% since the IPO, the company still has a market cap of $3.53 billion. Sprinklr has reported earnings 3 times as a public entity, and a look at the results shows a positive trend line. For fiscal Q422, which ended on January 31, the company had $136 million in total revenue, up 30% year-over-year, and the second consecutive quarter of top-line sequential gains. EPS has also been rising since the IPO. On a non-GAAP basis, it was recorded as a 9-cent loss per share in fiscal 2Q22 – but that moderate to a 5-cent EPS loss in the current quarter. Looking ahead, Sprinklr is guiding toward $140 million to $142 million in total revenue for fiscal 1Q23, for a 3.6% sequential gain at the midpoint. The company expects growth in subscription revenue to drive this result, with subscriptions bringing in $123 million to $125 million. For the full fiscal year 2023, the company expects revenues between $607 million and $615 million; at the midpoint, this will represent a 24% gain over fiscal ’22, which in its own turn saw revenues grow 27% from fiscal ’21. Covering Sprinklr stock for JPMorgan, 5-star analyst Mark Murphy writes: “We remain encouraged by the company’s ongoing product innovations and believe that a healthy pipeline headed into FY23 creates an attractive backdrop for the company and stock, particularly at depressed current valuation levels... We continue to believe Sprinklr is well positioned to capitalize on a higher rate of investments toward customer experience as a source of competitive differentiation and believe that a strong growth runway for the company’s growing, sophisticated platform presents an attractive risk-reward dynamic longer-term.” With these comments as a base, Murphy rates Sprinklr shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy); his $20 price target implies an upside of ~45% for the next 12 months. (To watch Murphy’s track record, click here) After less than a year in the public markets, Sprinklr has already picked up 9 analyst reviews. These break down to 5 Buys and 4 Holds, giving the stock a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. The average price target of $16.86 implies an upside of ~22% from the current trading price of $13.83. (See Sprinklr stock forecast on TipRanks) Cara Therapeutics (CARA) We don’t think about our skin much, but the skin is the body’s largest organ, and an itch can be a symptom of something wrong underneath. Cara Therapeutics is a late-clinical, commercial-stage biopharma company with a single product – difelikefalin, under the trade name KORSUVA – developed as a treatment for pruritis, the fancy name for itchy skin. As an injectable treatment, KORSUVA received FDA approval last year as a treatment for itchy skin related to chronic kidney disease, in adults currently undergoing hemodialysis treatments. The company is conducting its launch of KORSUVA this month in collaboration with Vifor, its commercial partner. The partners have assembled marketing and sales reps, and Cara reports that sufficient stocks of KORSUVA have been manufactured and are warehoused pending distribution orders. In addition to the above approved application, KORSUVA is undergoing Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials as an oral treatment for itching skin caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic liver disease (CLD), atopic dermatitis (AD), and notalgia paresthetica (NP). Phase 3 trials on the CKD and AD indications are set for initiation in 1H22. Cara saw a windfall revenue in 4Q20, due to partnership fees from Vifor. Since then, the company has seen minimal revenues, although it expects that to change as the KORSUVA launch proceeds. Cara had $236.8 million in cash on hand at the end of December, 2021, to fund its operations. JPMorgan's Jessica Fye covers this biopharma as it emerges into the commercial realm, and she is impressed with what she sees. “We see potential for >$700mm 2030 WW sales for Korsuva injection, which we see setting a valuation support for shares. Indeed, at current levels, we see CARA shares reflecting risk-adjusted commercial potential of Korsuva injection in hemodialysis patients alone with limited downside from near-term clinical readouts involving oral Korsuva,"" Fye noted. ""With the stock down [25%] from its November highs but no fundamental change to how we think about Korsuva Injection launch nor the chances of success from upcoming oral readouts and taking into account the relatively strong balance sheet, we see a more favorable risk/reward at current levels,” the analyst added. These comments support Fye’s Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on CARA shares, while her $19 price target suggests a 12-month upside potential of 40%. (To watch Fye’s track record, click here) The rest of the Street supports Fye’s thesis. In fact, the average price target is even more upbeat; at $26, the figure is expected to yield 12-month returns of 91%. The stock boasts a Strong Buy consensus rating, based on a unanimous 4 Buy reviews.

4/15/2022,"A return to go-go inflation is lousy on the wallet but may be good for your tax refund. The U.S. inflation rate hit 8.5% in March over the past 12 months – the largest 12-month increase since December 1981 when ""Falcon Crest"" debuted on Friday nights on CBS right after ""Dallas."" Gas prices alone rose 48% in March, contributing to the unsteady feeling that consumers have about their wealth and the health of the U.S. economy. Oddly enough, the IRS has a form relating to an inflation play for savings that some late filers still have time to consider. We're edging closer to the April 18 deadline for filing federal income tax returns, Michigan returns and city of Detroit and other communities. While many people never heard of this tax tip, taxpayers can file what's called Form 8888 to use at least part of their federal income tax refund to directly buy inflation-indexed savings bonds when they're filing their federal tax returns. True, until inflation started heating up, many people heard more about bitcoin than I Bonds. Now, though, I Bonds are paying the highest inflation-adjusted rates since they were introduced in September 1998, which makes sense since consumer prices haven't skyrocketed this much in roughly 40 years. Savers began to do a serious double take in November when the annualized rate for new inflation-indexed savings bonds hit 7.12% for a six-month period. ►2022 tax guide: Key dates for filing and extensions, claiming credits and planning for refunds I Bond rates are far higher than the rates savers are getting on bank deposits. The average one-year certificate of deposit is yielding 0.22% now, up only slightly compared with a mere 0.18% a year ago, according to Bankrate.com. Savers who shop around can find top-yielding CDs at 1.25% now, according to Bankrate.com, compared with 0.67% a year ago. I Bond rates aren't simple, unfortunately, to understand. That 7.12% annualized I Bond rate applies to the first six months after you bought I Bonds from Nov. 1, 2021, through April 30, 2022. The high rate ultimately kicks in for I Bonds bought before Nov. 1, 2021, too. When the high 7.12% annualized rate would start varies on the month when you bought the bond. Again, it applies to a six-month window. Sales for I Bonds have been hitting records. I Bond purchases reached $1.31 billion in November, $3.04 billion in December, $3.538 billion in January, $1.246 billion in February, and $1.378 billion in March, according to the Government Monthly Statement of Public Debt. By contrast early last year, savers bought but $249 million in I Bonds in January 2021. I Bonds outsold Series EE savings bonds for the past five months by $100 to $1, according to Pederson. (The Series EE rate is but 0.1% for bonds bought from November through April 30; the bonds, though, are guaranteed to double in value if kept for 20 years so longer-term savers would earn a considerably higher rate.) And rates are likely to go higher – creating even more frenzy for the I Bond story. The latest inflation data allows for estimates about where rates for I Bonds will go in the future. The annualized rate, which will be announced on May 1, is likely to be around 9.6% for a six-month period, according to Daniel Pederson, a Monroe, Michigan-based savings bond expert and founder of www.BondHelper.com.  Again, the upcoming I Bond rate would apply for six months for purchases beginning May 1. Don't worry if you bought I Bonds previously, though, as you do get the new higher rate for a six-month period as well. ►2022 taxes: Refunds are higher thanks to Child Tax Credit, third stimulus check ►Tax deadline this year: Not ready for the April 18 tax deadline? Here's how to file an extension. ►Record inflation: After a string of 40-year highs, will inflation slow down? Some economists think so. Believe it or not, taxpayers can allocate tax refund money to I Bonds if they use Form 8888. The instructions note that you are able to use at least part of your refund to buy up to $5,000 in paper or electronic I Bonds. (You cannot use Form 8888 if you're trying to claim refund money via an ""Injured Spouse Allocation."") If you have a $6,000 refund, for example, you'll be able to buy only $5,000 in I Bonds and can directly deposit the rest elsewhere. The same form also allows you to directly deposit a refund or part of it into either two or three accounts at a bank or other financial institution, including a mutual fund or brokerage account. When Pederson electronically filed his tax return in March, he included Form 8888 to use some of his refund money to buy I Bonds. ""I still haven't gotten the paper bonds yet,"" Pederson said. When he gets them, he's going to pay close attention to the issue date to see what rate first kicks in. He maintains that given when he filed his return he should be getting the rate before the new rate hits May 1. Not surprisingly, his tax professional did not see a flood of taxpayers using Form 8888 to buy I Bonds. What issue date would you get? The Internal Revenue Service notes that I Bonds won't be issued until the agency completes processing your tax return. The return process needs to be completed, the IRS said, in case there are changes in the actual refund amount. The instructions for Form 8888 point out that I Bonds wouldn't be issued, for example, if your refund is decreased because of a math error. And I Bonds wouldn't be issued if your federal income tax refund is offset for any reason to cover an unpaid debt owed to state and federal agencies and then the refund ends up being sent to you in the form of a check. The amount you buy in I Bonds via your tax refund must be in multiples of $50 or the request will be rejected. A bond request that's for $438 would be rejected. You'd have to request $400 in I Bonds in this example and take the remaining $38 via direct deposit elsewhere. Dollar limits exist for I Bond purchases each year. The tax refund route enables you to buy up to $5,000 in I Bonds on top of other limits. The annual limit is $10,000 in I Bonds that can be bought each calendar year per person. You buy savings bonds at www.TreasuryDirect.gov and hold them in an online account. You can no longer buy savings bonds in person at banks. Paper I Bonds are only available if you allocate all or part of your income tax refund to I Bonds on Form 8888 when you file your tax return. ►I Bonds: What's not to love? The US savings bond with inflation protection gets ignored ►Profit during inflation?: These five tips could help investors beat rising prices The last thing anyone should do is cash out of I Bonds bought 15 years ago or so to buy these newer bonds. The reason? Some older bonds still are paying far more than the new ones. I Bonds bought before Nov. 1, 2001, for example, are the best of the bunch and have a fixed rate of 3% or higher. The highest fixed rate was 3.6% for I Bonds issued from May 2000 through October 2000. Savers holding older I Bonds with a fixed rate of 3% or higher would see an annualized rate of around 12.6% or more once that estimated May 1 rate kicks in. Savers who bought in future years saw that fixed rate drop a bit to around 2% or higher for I Bonds bought after late 2001 but before Nov. 1, 2002. Any inflation adjustment is added to that fixed rate. As of November 2002, we were looking at a fixed rate of 1% or higher for I Bonds bought before May 1, 2008. I Bonds bought after May 1, 2008, end up with much smaller fixed rates. Depending on when you bought the bond, the smaller fixed rates will vary. The fixed rate on I Bonds consistently has been 0% for bonds bought from May 2020. If inflation cools in the next year or two, the inflation-adjusted rate would be lower but still added onto that 0% fixed rate. One inflation-focused strategy suggests buying I Bonds before April 30 to lock in an exceptionally strong rate over a one-year time frame. The annualized rate of 7.12% for the first six months would start in April and run six months through September for bonds bought before April 30. Then the same bonds would pay an estimated annualized rate of 9.6% from October through March. Following this strategy, Pederson said, the average rate would end up being 8.36% over the 12 months. It's important to know that you cannot cash I Bonds until you've held them for at least 12 months. And you'd lose the most recent three months of interest if you redeem the I Bonds within the first five years. Even if you had to sell the I Bonds a bit more than a year after buying them, Pederson said, you'd be earning close to 5.96% after the penalty if you buy before the rate changes on May 1. (As April 30 is a Saturday, you'd want to buy the I Bonds a few days beforehand to make sure to get that April rate.) Inflation could remain steady in the months ahead, given Russia's war against Ukraine and supply chain disruptions. But inflation could also cool down some, as the Federal Reserve moves to boost rates and Washington makes some moves to bring down the price of gas. What's known now is the rate that's good through April 30 and we have a decent estimate for the six-month range after that. I Bonds make sense for savers who want to snag significantly higher rates than if they parked that money in a one-year certificate of deposit. Contact Susan Tompor via stompor@freepress.com.

4/15/2022,"Ripple secured a big win in its lawsuit against the SEC this week, legal analysts said. A judge ruled that the SEC release documents that may prove it has selectively enforced regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. If the SEC now settles, XRP could be in for a big jump. Ripple, the developer of the XRP blockchain of which XRP is the native token, secured a big win this week in its ongoing lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC initiated legal proceedings against Ripple in December 2021 for the alleged sale of unregistered securities, with the SEC claiming that XRP is a security and not a commodity. The judge presiding over the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple denied an SEC motion for reconsideration of the deliberate process privilege regarding a set of emails and draft versions of a speech made by then SEC Director William Hinman back in June 2018. In other words, the SEC will now have to release these emails and the draft versions of the 2018 speech. Earlier in the month, nonprofit organisation Empowerment Oversight publicised a separate set of internal SEC emails (acquired via a freedom of information act) that contained evidence of improper conduct by SEC officials involved in the Ripple lawsuit and expose a conflict of interest. In the emails released by Empowerment Oversight, former SEC Director William Hinman is warned about a potential conflict of interest with the lawsuit against Ripple, given his previous employer Simpson Thacher is an organisation that has worked to promote ethereum. Empowerment Oversight said the yet-to-be-released emails/draft versions relating to Hinman’s 2018 speech may demonstrate that the SEC was selectively enforcing regulations in the cryptocurrency industry. Moreover, they may prove that Hinman knowingly had a conflict of interest when the lawsuit against Ripple was initiated. One defense lawyer familiar with the case said that judges decision marked a “very big win for Ripple”. The SEC will now have 14 days (from 11 April) to file an objection to the ruling. Prior to the ruling that the SEC would have to turn over these documents, John Deaton, a defense attorney representing 65,000 XRP holders on the side of Ripple in the lawsuit, said that he did not think the SEC would not turn over these documents. “If we get a ruling that they (the emails/draft version of the speech) must be turned over, I believe the case settles w/in 60-90 days from that decision (or possibly sooner),” he said. Even though it looks as though the tide has turned in favour of Ripple in its ongoing lawsuit with the SEC and the SEC may soon opt to settle, XRP is yet to show significant signs of life. Indeed, XRP/USD has been under pressure in recent weeks, falling back 20% from March highs above 0.90 to current levels in the low 0.70s, in tandem with a broader pullback in cryptocurrency markets. But this could be an opportunity for the bulls. Some crypto analysts have argued that XRP could be in store for a massive rally if the SEC does settle its case against Ripple in the coming weeks/months. Bulls would likely look for XRP to break out to fresh year-to-date highs, perhaps above the $1.0 level, which could open the door to a run towards H2 2021 highs in the upper $1.30s/$1.40 area. Further gains would be difficult in the absence of a broader improvement in crypto market sentiment, which doesn’t seem too likely just yet with inflation in the US and other major economies still elevated, suggesting large central bank rate hikes ahead.
