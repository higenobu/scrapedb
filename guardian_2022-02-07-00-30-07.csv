2/7/2022,"British citizens who want to return permanently visa-free to the UK with EU families post-Brexit will not be penalised by Home Office delays as long as they apply for their paperwork within the next two months, the government has said. The confirmation will come as a relief to British citizens suffering anxiety and distress over Home Office delays because of the looming 29 March deadline to apply for the EU settlement scheme (EUSS).  It is too late, however, for a 67-year-old British woman and her 80-year-old French husband who have been waiting 10 months for a Home Office decision. After their case made headlines in the UK, their hopes were raised when they received communication from the Home Office hours later that a decision was close. “To be honest I was shocked. We got a refusal,” said Carmel, who asked that her real name not be used. The couple, who are artists, sold their house near Perpignan last summer and planned to move to Cornwall for what they hoped would be a re-energising post-retirement relocation. They were refused on the grounds that Carmel had not provided a translation of their marriage certificate and tax statement, and had given insufficient proof that she had lived in France for 30 years. “It’s not what we hoped,” she said, adding that when they applied there was no evident requirement to translate documents. “My sister and I scoured the application form for what proof we needed. We provided passports, marriage certificate, joint bank statements and my tax certificates. There was nothing back then asking for translations,” she said. The Home Office said Carmel had the option of making any other application free of charge or appealing within 28 days. But the couple have now decided they don’t want to deal with more Home Office stress. “It’s been a fiasco and we’ve decided not to move back now but to buy a place in Paris,” said Carmel. Ben Bramich is among those relieved to hear they can still apply for settled status even if the permit arrives after the deadline for non-UK spouses of Britons living in Europe before Brexit. He has also been waiting 10 months and he and his wife Valerie are now on their eighth Airbnb in Brussels while they wait for the Home Office permit. Asked whether spouses could apply for EU settled status if they missed the deadline because of Home Office delays, the Home Office issued this statement. “Where an application for an EUSS family permit is made on this basis by 29 March 2022 but is not decided by that date, it will continue to be processed and an EUSS family permit will be issued where the applicant meets the requirements. “Family members of returning British citizens who are granted an EUSS family permit, which they applied for by 29 March 2022, will be considered to have ‘reasonable grounds’ for applying in the UK to the EUSS after that deadline. They should apply to the EUSS as soon as they reasonably can after their return to the UK.” The Bramiches had planned to move back to the UK last summer but had their first application for a family permit refused on the grounds of insufficient paperwork. His wife had to delay a transfer from her work to the UK and the father of two separated from his children after taking a job and a rental house in Cheshire. He also contacted the Brexit-supporting MP Esther McVey but her office said they were unable to get an answer from the Home Office. An assistant in her office told him in an email that she empathised but was powerless. “Esther is in agreement that delays such as this are plainly unacceptable. Unfortunately, unlike other government departments, the Home Office is not open to MPs approaching ministers concerning individual cases,” she said. The parliamentary ombudsman is now looking into a complaint by Bramich on the grounds that the Home Office offers “unclear guidelines” and has no service level agreement on response times, “long delays in processing” and “rejection without giving the chance to applicants to provide missing documentation”. Bramich said he was hopeful they would be approved but could not understand why it was such a nightmare to get the permit in the first place. “We ended up submitting about 200 pages of documents. We just threw the sink at it,” he said. “Is it really so complex to process these applications? My wife and I have been married for 15 years. We actually met when we were in England and both lived in England, but we moved away from England and now we can’t come back. “We are married, we have two kids. It is very straightforward but they make it so difficult,” he said. “Everyone’s really worried and anxious and angry about what is to happen in. If you read some of the forums online, the distress and anxiety is immense.” A Home Office spokesperson said applications for EUSS family permits were “decided as soon as possible, but waiting times can vary depending on the volume of applications received and the complexity of the case being considered. As a result, customers may experience a longer wait than usual for their decision”.",News/Politics,Home Office says delays will not affect UK citizens returning with EU families,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/home-office-says-delays-will-not-affect-uk-citizens-returning-with-eu-families
2/7/2022,"Things rarely associated with fun: 1) free jazz, 2) math rock, 3) Black Country, New Road. On the London band’s second album there is less of the “fire in a pet shop” jazz than on their 2021 debut For the First Time, but there are still whiplash changes of time signature and songs that take forever to get going. Thankfully, music isn’t just about fun: it can be about creating remarkable soundworlds of baroque pop fantasias, and this band are outstanding at those. Like Arcade Fire, BC,NR’s playfulness and humour is unfairly overlooked, smothered by an intensity that seems utterly inimical to fun. Maybe it’s not quite TV Burp, but Isaac Wood’s voice, heavy like a father’s frown, solemnly obsessing over Billie Eilish, Concorde and “the clamp”, is a hoot. Shame that he unexpectedly left the band last week, as he’s often the best thing about it.  He kills on the long-awaited Basketball Shoes, which performs the same task here as it does at their gigs: a slippery, shifting set closer that partly reprises what you’ve just heard, and spurs the band on to a startling, vicious crescendo. To get the full effect, listen to the album from start to finish, over and over again. It’s a blast.",Arts/Music,"Black Country, New Road: Ants from Up There review – a baroque pop masterpiece",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/06/black-country-new-road-ants-from-up-there-review-a-baroque-pop-masterpiece-isaac-wood
2/7/2022,"The key question comes towards the end of this fine investigation into why we are taking more children into care than since records began in the 1990s, exercising draconian powers, including forced adoption, to break up more families than any other western country. “Is the system so corrupted by 30 years of distrust that it is beyond repair?” asks journalist Polly Curtis. The answer has to be yes, if her meticulous investigation, conducted over many months, is any guide. The reasons why are not so complex. If you are a poor white, Asian, black and/or disabled person, your family is much more likely to be split apart by a system that can appear ferociously unfair to a growing group of parents and carers who see social workers and other professionals as nothing more than “baby snatchers”. Hence the mistrust.  Curtis excavates the truth via interviews with social workers, judges, fathers who are invisible in the system, mothers who have doubly lost their children – because they are victims of domestic abuse and deemed unable to protect them and because the abuser may be given parental access by the secretive family courts – and survivors of care (often marked in adult life by homelessness, addiction, prison and other rotten outcomes). The truth comes camouflaged by red tape and a growing professional fear that to risk giving a family the benefit of the doubt is to potentially endure a bloody trial by the tabloid press. The facts are stark. More than 80,000 children are in care at a cost of more than £9bn a year. A third could have stayed with their parents if there had been early intervention, sustained support for the family as a whole and a recognition that however many challenges parents and carers face – including the “toxic trio” of substance abuse, domestic abuse and mental illness – they have a strong desire to do the best they can by their children. Austerity, Curtis says, has stripped away that infrastructure. In affluent Kingston upon Thames in south-west London, 33 out of 10,000 children are in care. In Blackpool, that statistic soars to 210 in 10,000. “We are missing a chance to prevent fires,” says one social worker, “so there are more fires to put out later.” Under the 1989 Children Act, proceedings are undertaken when a child is “suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm”. Since the recognition, in 2015, that coercive control should be an offence punishable by up to five years in prison, calculating harm has an added onus. It has to be “interpreted, understood and disentangled from a social worker’s own expectations of what parenting should look like”. A process, Curtis says, that is riddled with “class bias and prejudice”. Only 20% of a social worker’s time is spent with families: the remainder is absorbed by bureaucracy. Josh MacAlister, whose independent review into children’s social care is published in the spring, describes it as “a doom loop”. “More rules mean less responsibility for individual judgment [and] when people don’t have agency the job becomes less attractive… that leaves bigger gaps, so you need more rules.” The deaths of children haunt this book. In 2020, six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was killed by his father and stepmother and 16-month-old Star Hobson was punched to death by Savannah Brockhill, her mother’s girlfriend. The extended family had asked for help but went unheard. Before that were the horrific killings of Victoria Climbié and Baby P. Every time it’s promised that lessons will be learned, but a child dies still every week in the UK at the hands of someone they love and trust. What this book reminds us is that intervention early enough to salvage a young life is inextricably part of an ethos and training that also understands when a family can be rebuilt again. Of course, there are outstanding social workers, teachers, lawyers and other professionals who can and do work miracles, but it’s a jalopy of a system. Curtis suggests splitting social work into a smaller team of child protection officers who investigate abuse and neglect and a larger fleet of community workers who provide early support to the extended family, offering “kindness, candour and rigour”. A strong society, Curtis points out, builds families instead of tearing them apart. Tragically, for too many children and those who love them, this is a society profoundly scarred by weakness.

2/7/2022,"Chelsea moved to within two points of league leaders Arsenal, having played a game less, with Guro Reiten’s glancing header the difference in a stifling 1-0 win over Manchester City. Emma Hayes’s squad continued to show the strength in its depth, with Jess Carter providing the assist for Reiten’s winning header, after the manager had praised the performance of players who have stepped up when called upon after Wednesday’s 3-1 defeat of Manchester United.  “I’m so proud of these performances,” said Hayes, midweek. “Because I didn’t know how we’d fair with all these back-to-back games … they’ve shown something when the team really needed them to.” Although five points separated the two teams prior to this meeting, with Chelsea also having played a game less, momentum in the title race has very much been with the two Manchester teams in recent weeks. City were on a nine-game unbeaten run in all competitions before the trip south, with the team’s only dropped points coming in a 1-1 draw with league leaders Arsenal. Hayes had arrested Chelsea’s struggles at the end of the year, which saw them knocked out of the Champions League, but a scoreless draw with Brighton put Arsenal in the driving seat. No WSL season has provided quite as many twists, turns and upsets at the top though and, with Arsenal having dropped two points in a 1-1 draw with a swaggering United on Saturday, suddenly the prize on offer on Sunday was all the sweeter. Chelsea welcome the Gunners to Kingsmeadow on Friday night for a likely title decider under the lights, and the chance to avenge the 3-2 defeat they suffered at the Emirates Stadium on the opening day of the season. After an impressive midweek cameo late on against Manchester United, a day after landing back in England from India where she competed for Australia in the Asian Cup, Sam Kerr was returned to the starting XI and summer acquisition Aniek Nouwen continued to partner Millie Bright in defence in the absence of club captain Magda Eriksson due to injury. Similarly, former Arsenal academy graduate Ruby Mace was charged with filling the boots of captain Steph Houghton for City and dealt well with the constant threat of Kerr and Pernille Harder. With a whippy wind behind them, Chelsea weathered a short spell of City possession before taking control and in the 14th minute they had the lead as a swooping cross from full-back Jess Carter was glanced over Greenwood and past goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck into the far corner by Norwegian forward Reiten. City struggled to find the rhythm that has powered the team through their recent run of games. The impressive forward Jess Park, who had been named player of the match in back-to-back games, was kept quiet until the 39th minute when she would pop up with City’s best chance of the half, meeting a free-kick with her left foot and forcing a strong save from Chelsea keeper Ann-Katrin Berger. Having pulled the strings of the Chelsea attack in the absence of Kerr and Fran Kirby, with the latter only deemed fit enough for the bench, Harder showed no signs of relinquishing the reins despite the staggered return of the duo and the home team pressed forward with Harder at the crux of all their positive play. More impressive though, was the back four of Carter, Bright, Nouwen and Andersson, of which only Bright has been a regular starter in recent years. City had scored 37 goals in their nine-game unbeaten stretch with wingers Lauren Hemp and Park particularly potent. However, at Kingsmeadow both struggled to impose themselves on the game and centre-forward Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw and her second half replacement Ellen White, lacked the service they have become accustomed to when flanked by the duo. Despite a late City charge, boosted by the introduction of Julia Blakstad, Vicky Losada and White, Chelsea held strong and extended their unbeaten run against City to 10 games – four wins and six draws.",Sport/Football,Chelsea close gap at top of WSL after Guro Reiten sees off Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/06/chelsea-manchester-city-womens-super-league-match-report
2/7/2022,"Long-awaited government proposals to reform gambling laws are now unlikely to to be published until May, the Guardian understands, in a fresh delay that prompted a Labour MP to urge that turmoil within the Tory party must not disrupt the process. The department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) launched a review of gambling laws in December 2020, amid mounting concern about addiction and children’s exposure through advertising and football sponsorship.  A white paper was originally due to be published before the end of 2021 but was postponed until early 2022, amid a cabinet reshuffle that saw John Whittingdale replaced as gambling minister by Chris Philp. The proposals are now not expected until May, three sources with knowledge of the process told the Guardian, fuelling renewed concern among gambling addiction campaigners demanding urgent reform. Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group of MPs examining gambling-related harm, voiced fears that the uncertainty surrounding the future of Boris Johnson, who is understood to be supportive of gambling reform, could disrupt the review. “Of course time must be taken to gather the evidence to ensure the right reforms are put in place, but the gambling review was announced over two years ago, the Labour MP said. “Every day of delay leads to further gambling related harm while the industry rakes in profits. The government must not let its own internal problems stand in the way of much-needed reforms for this country – it is time for action.” Liz Ritchie co-founded the charity Gambling With Lives with husband Charles after the suicide of their son Jack, who had become addicted to gambling while still at school. “Someone takes their life every day in the UK because of gambling, so we simply cannot wait until May to see this white paper,” she said. “How many more families need to be shattered by highly addictive gambling products and predatory gambling industry practices before the government acts?” Ministers and officials at DCMS have been working closely with the industry regulator, the Gambling Commission, on potential reforms to improve protection of addicts and vulnerable people. But the regulator is under-resourced, according to reports by the Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office, while it is also overseeing the decision on which company will win the next 10-year licence to operate the National Lottery. A decision is expected this month or in early March. Matt Zarb-Cousin, a former Jeremy Corbyn adviser and recovering gambling addict who runs campaign group Clean Up Gambling, said the review was urgently required “before more people are harmed as a result of regulation that is not fit for purpose”. The government’s review of gambling laws has prompted a flurry of lobbying activity. Reform campaigners, helped by funding from former casino and poker industry veteran Derek Webb, highlighted stories of addiction and transgressions by major industry operators. The gambling industry’s links to MPs have come under scrutiny, including lucrative second jobs and hospitality lavished on politicians, some of whom were members of a group that wrote a controversial report criticising the Gambling Commission for trying to reduce gambling addiction. The DCMS declined to comment.",News/Society,UK government ‘puts off review of gambling laws until May’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/uk-government-puts-off-review-of-gambling-laws-until-may
2/7/2022,"The business secretary has been accused of being disrepectful to victims of scammers after he defended Boris Johnson’s claim that crime was falling by 14% – which is only true if fraud is excluded. Speaking to the BBC, Kwasi Kwarteng backed Johnson’s use of the figure, saying the prime minister had been talking about “crime that people experience in their day-to-day lives”, which “in terms of burglary, in terms of physical injury, has gone down”.  Johnson was last week rebuked by the statistics watchdog for making the claim, as he had not made clear that this excludes fraud and computer misuse. Including those, crime has in fact increased by 14% between the year ending September 2019 and the year ending September 2021. In a letter to the Lib Dems, who raised the issue, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, Sir David Norgrove, said the government had presented crime figures in a “misleading way”. Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Morning, Kwarteng said he did not know “what the evidence is” for the prime minister’s claim not being true. “All I know is, certainly on the doorstep, people are saying that there is progress being made,” he said. “I think fraud is really, really important, but people are talking particularly about burglaries, about personal injury, about physical crimes, and I think in that context we’re seeing lower crimes, I think the prime minister was right. “He was referring to personal injury and crime in relation to individuals. The point the prime minister was making is that crime that people experience in their day-to-day lives … in terms of burglary, in terms of physical injury, has gone down and that’s absolutely right.” His comments were rejected by Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, who said suggesting that fraud is a “lesser crime not experienced by people in their day-to-day lives is shamefully out of touch and disrespectful to victims across the country, scammed by dangerous criminals and losing hard-earned life savings”. The senior Labour MP said: “Yet again the Conservatives are downgrading or ignoring criminal fraud – just as Rishi Sunak did when writing off £4.3bn of public money. “Lord Agnew himself said it best – the government has ‘little interest in the consequences of fraud to our society’. “This chaotic and incompetent government is a complete disgrace – they cannot be trusted to take seriously our safety and security.” Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem who raised the issue with the statistics authority, said the failure of Conservative ministers to “stand up to Boris Johnson’s dishonesty and lack of decency is doing huge damage to public trust”. “Instead of apologising for misleading the public over rising crime, Kwasi Kwarteng doubled down on this blatant lie,” he said. “This is an insult to every victim of fraud crime. Instead of fighting their corner, this government is ignoring the plight of all those who have been cruelly robbed in their own homes and on their own devices.” He also called on Johnson to come before parliament as soon as possible to correct the record.",News/Politics,Kwasi Kwarteng branded ‘disrespectful’ to victims of scammers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/kwasi-kwarteng-branded-disrespectful-to-victims-of-scammers
