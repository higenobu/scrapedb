1/7/2022,"Ireland Baldwin is opening up about her anxiety disorder. The 26-year-old model, who is the daughter of former married couple Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, shared a photo on Instagram of her holding a blood pressure monitoring device, which she said helps her manage a phobia that she has struggled with for a long time. Baldwin wrote, “This is not an ad for a blood pressure machine. This is not at ad at all. I am posting this for whoever suffers with anxiety and anxiety disorders like I do. I ordered a blood pressure monitor to accurately read my heart rate and blood pressure because I live in a constant fear that I’m dying from a heart attack… also known as cardiophobia.” She shared that the symptoms of her anxiety, which include “heart palpitations” and “chest pain,” can mimic signs of a heart attack, and have made her call ambulances and go to the hospital, where she was assured by medical professionals there was nothing wrong with her heart. Though Baldwin shared that she has worked with anxiety specialists, nothing brings her more “comfort” than having this device. “I just want anyone who suffers from their own anxieties to know that I am here and you are not alone. It can be so embarrassing and isolating at times,” she continued. “My anxiety has made me miss out on a lot in this life and my true 2022 goal is not let it get in my way. I have anxiety that is caused by food, my digestive system, my heart, big crowds, talking about anxiety, airplanes, you name it. You’re not alone. Hold on to your comfort item right. Don’t let people make you feel guilty for having to take a walk or take some space or stay home because you’re not feeling good. Surround yourself with people who understand or at least try to. And if you’re feeling anxious right now… deep breaths. You’re going to be OK.” People in Baldwin’s comment section applauded her for the vulnerable post — and many opened up about their own phobias, stemming from anxiety. “Yup this is me,” one wrote. “I wore a heart monitor for two weeks, did blood work, had an EKG, and everything came back normal. But in my head it still didn’t bring me comfort, constantly worrying about me, a healthy [30 year old] dying from a heart attack. The palpitations have subsided but [it] doesn’t make it any easier.” Another added, “I suffer from the same exact phobia and have had four ambulance visits to the ER in a six week period of time. Thank you so much for the vulnerability and speaking about this and helping me realize I’m not alone.” Baldwin has spoken out about her mental health struggles before. In 2018, she took to her Instagram Story to talk about overcoming body image problems, writing, “I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance! Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn't worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn't worth it!!""

In the wake of the tragedy at Travis Scott's Astroworld Festival in Houston, Ireland Baldwin reprimanded people for spreading misinformation.   ""Making baseless, misinformed claims and conspiracy theories all over the internet does nothing but [take] away from the facts and actually honoring those who are suffering due to this,"" she wrote in one of a series of social media posts over the weekend. ""I was personally 'triggered' because of recent misinformation that spread from the tragic event that took place on my father's movie set.

 Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) confirmed in a new interview that she told Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during the Jan. 6 riot ""Get away from me, you f---ing did this,"" as the lawmakers were being escorted away from the protesters who had stormed the Capitol building. Cheney confirmed the interaction during an interview with The New York Times's Michael Barbaro for ""The Daily"" podcast that was published on Thursday, the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack. Asked by Barbaro if the confrontation, first reported in the book ""I Alone Can Fix It,"" was true, Cheney said ""yeah,"" before detailing her thoughts during the expletive-ridden interaction. ""I was in the aisle, on the aisle and he [Jordan] came over to me, you know, and basically said, we need to get the ladies away from the aisle. And, you know, I had watched for the months since the election what was going on and the lies that have been told to people,"" Cheney told Barbaro. ""And, you know, it was both that I, you know, certainly didn't need his help, and secondly, I thought clearly that the lie that they had been spreading and telling people had absolutely contributed to what we were living through at that moment,"" she added. She confirms a now infamous moment from Jan 6th. pic.twitter.com/5v0lU5CN7S - Michael Barbaro (@mikiebarb) January 6, 2022 Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker first reported on the interaction in their book. It reportedly came to light during a phone call between Cheney and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ""That f---ing guy Jim Jordan. That son of a bitch,"" Cheney told Milley, according to the book. ""While these maniacs are going through the place, I'm standing in the aisle and he said, 'We need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you.' I smacked his hand away and told him, 'Get away from me. You f---ing did this.' "" The Hill has reached out to Jordan for comment. More than a dozen Democrats are on hand for a moment of silence marking the Jan. 6 anniversary at today's House pro forma session.

The U.S. recognized the solemn anniversary with a number of events on Thursday, including addresses from President Biden and Vice President Harris and a conversation with historians on Capitol Hill ""to establish and preserve the narrative of Jan. 6."" Jordan, a close ally of former President Trump, was one of the nearly 150 GOP lawmakers to object to the counting of Electoral College votes from certain states in an effort to contest the 2020 presidential election. Cheney, on the other hand, has been a vocal critic of Trump and the role he played in inciting the violent mob that overtook the Capitol. She is one of the only two Republicans to sit on the House select committee probing the Jan. 6 attack. She was present on the House floor for a moment of silence on Thursday along with her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, where the Republican side of the chamber stood almost entirely empty.",Politics/The Hill,Cheney confirms she told Jim Jordan on Jan. 6 'Get away from me.

1/7/2022,"The Missouri Senate candidate who waved his gun at protestors wants his guns back after being pardoned. The city of St. Louis, however, said that Mark McCloskey is not entitled to the weapons due to his original guilty plea. An official from the city counselor's office said the guns should have already been destroyed by now due to a court order. The city of St. Louis is declining to return the guns that were taken from Mark and Patricia McCloskey in 2020 after they waved the firearms at Black Lives Matter protestors in their neighborhood. The couple originally pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault in June 2021, but were pardoned by Missouri Gov. Mike Parson in August 2021. Mark McCloskey, a Republican Senate candidate, filed a lawsuit against the state of Missouri and city of St. Louis to restore his ownership of the guns in late 2021. He argued that because of Parson's pardon, he and his wife are entitled to receive the $872.50 they were originally fined along with their weapons. But in a motion filed on Monday, counsel for the city said the governor's pardon ""did not supersede or displace the finding of guilt or order of forfeiture of the weapons, defendants' continued possession of the weapons is not wrongful and Mr. McCloskey is not entitled to their immediate possession."" The counsel said that because of Mark McCloskey's guilty plea, the city of St. Louis has no plans to return the firearms. Mark McCloskey previously said in a court filing that the two guns, a Bryco .380-caliber pistol and a Colt AR-15 rifle, are cumulatively valued at $1,900. Despite being seized in 2020 and a court order to destroy the firearms, the guns are still under the possession of the city's police and sheriff's department. According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Dierker of the City Counselor's Office said in a virtual hearing on Wednesday that Mark McCloskey is a ""beneficiary of bureaucratic, I want to say, ineptitude"" because the weapons have yet to be dismantled. ""But in any event,"" Dierker said, ""it's fortuitous that the weapons still exist."" According to Missouri's court docket, a jury trial over the guns is scheduled for McCloskey's case on February 22, 2022.
