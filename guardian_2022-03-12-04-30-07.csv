3/12/2022,"The Queen will not attend the annual Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on Monday, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. The 95-year-old monarch, who is the head of the Commonwealth, had hoped to join the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the event, after recently recovering from Covid-19. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: “After discussing the arrangements with the royal household, the Queen has asked the Prince of Wales to represent Her Majesty at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey on Monday. “The Queen will continue with other planned engagements, including in-person audiences, in the week ahead.” It is thought the decision was not due to any illness, but related to discussions about the comfort of getting the queen to and from the service. She will instead send a video message to the congregation and be represented at the event by the next in line to the throne, Prince Charles. The celebration is a favourite of the monarch, with music, poetry and speeches performed in an ode to the “family of nations”. The news comes hours after it was announced that the Queen will be moving out of Buckingham Palace and into her residence in Windsor Castle for the foreseeable future. She had been undertaking “light duties”, the Palace said, since a bout of ill-health, though was not currently ill. However, she is known to have suffered from mobility issues. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Prince Harry has confirmed he will not return to the UK for Prince Philip’s memorial service on 29 March. However, the Duke of Sussex did hope to visit his grandmother the Queen soon, the spokesperson said. In February, the Duke launched legal action against the Home Office for denying his family access to police protection when they visit the country.

3/12/2022,"Seventy four people have been charged over Insulate Britain road blockade protests in Kent, the county’s police force has said, in what is believed to be the first criminal proceedings against the activist group. The force said a total of 104 charges had been laid against Insulate Britain members in relation to protests that took place on the M25 and on roads near the port of Dover in September and October last year. All 74 defendants have been summonsed to appear at Crawley magistrates court from April. There were 73 charges of public nuisance, 29 charges of obstruction and two charges of criminal damage to a police car, Kent police said in a statement on Friday. Insulate Britain activists had previously only faced civil action over their protests, with at least 15 jailed after a high court hearings for breaching injunctions obtained by National Highways banning them from blocking parts of the road network. Insulate Britain said members had also been charged after investigations by the Metropolitan police and Hertfordshire constabulary, but the Guardian was unable to confirm details of the charges at the time of writing. The carried out a campaign of disruptive protests between September and October, blocking roads at rush hour, gluing themselves and causing traffic chaos in an effort to pressure the government into a national programme to insulate every home in the country by 2030. Activists said such a programme would be both a concrete first step in tackling the climate crisis and a measure to combat fuel poverty. But their methods proved divisive. Although the group had many supporters, many motorists accused them of targeting the wrong people and even fellow environmental activists warned its campaign could be counterproductive and chose to distance themselves from the group. At one stage police were deployed at every junction of the M25 in an attempt to stop the group, while ministers railed against “eco-warriors” who were “destroying people’s lives” and Boris Johnson called for powers to “insulate them snugly in prison”. The group had said it would continue its campaign until its demands were met or its members jailed, but last month it announced it would instead throw its weight behind a new campaign, Just Stop Oil, targeting Britain’s oil infrastructure. A spokesperson for the group said: “Insulate Britain supporters have received charges from the Met, Herts and Kent police. They along with the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service], will be seen by history as betraying this country, for criminalising those who wanted to protect all people living here in the UK and to start the process of decarbonisation to protect the nations of the global south. “The cost of living catastrophe is causing misery for millions of people in this country. Our proposal is a massive part of the solution. “Insulating Britain is also a huge part of the process of giving the UK energy security, which is obviously an important subject as we see war raging in Europe funded by fossil fuels. Oil and gas funds war and causes insecurity globally. The government must halt all future fossil fuel licences immediately to give humanity a chance of survival. In order to stop fossil fuels we need to Insulate Britain.” ",News/UK news,Kent police charge 74 people over Insulate Britain road protests,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/kent-police-charge-74-people-insulate-britain-road-protests-block-m25-dover
3/12/2022,"Commuters across New South Wales and Queensland are dodging gaping potholes and avoiding cracked roads after flooding damaged the states’ road networks, with mayors arguing they will need to be repaired stronger to withstand future disasters. Many NSW and Queensland councils are scrambling to find funding that could top $1bn in total to repair roads ripped apart by the devastating flood waters. As storms eased and waters receded in NSW this week, the full extent of the damage was revealed, with landslides and cracks on freeways, roads and suburban streets. You'll never complain about a pothole again. These are the roads damaged by #nswfloods in #richmondvalleyhttps://t.co/l618wvCGqM pic.twitter.com/0EqmoqVv7k Councils are responsible for 90% of the NSW road network including road safety and maintenance. Queensland councils are stewards of about 80% of that state’s roads and bridges. The Local Government NSW president, Darriea Turley, said it was “hard to determine” the full cost of repairs that councils faced because damage continued to be tracked. “Road maintenance is already one of the biggest expenses in council budgets without the damage that is expected from the flooding crisis,” Turley said. “Before the flooding crisis, the road maintenance backlog was around $1.7bn … there will be huge financial challenges ahead for councils to rebuild their communities. “It is crucial that councils receive sufficient funding and support from government to fund roads. Roads across NSW cannot just simply be rebuilt, but rather, they need to be rebuilt to withstand future disasters.” On Sydney’s northern beaches, where flood waters shut off the three major routes in and out of the CBD, a “massive cleanup effort” was under way as council crews began to assess and repair damaged infrastructure. A Northern Beaches council spokesperson said there had been hundreds of requests for assistance since flood waters hit on Tuesday, particularly around Manly, Balgowlah, Dee Why and Narrabeen. More than 20 landslips had been reported. Have been on the bus from Wynyard for an hour and only at Mosman. This explains why #sydneytraffic #chaoscontinues pic.twitter.com/0QG6BT1bSi “There are significant potholes, trees and landslips impacting the road network,” the spokesperson said. “The priority has been to reopen roads as soon as possible and while most are now open some will take longer to make safe.” The Northern Beaches mayor, Michael Regan, said it was too early to tell how high the repair cost would be but the council welcomed funding from state and federal governments to assist with the cleanup. “Across our entire region we have seen extensive damage and while we are thankful to have the rain ease, the cleanup and recovery process we are faced with is significant,” he said. The Blue Mountains mayor, Mark Greenhill, said the cost of repairing and future-proofing roads in his shire was expected to be in the vicinity of $50m with landslip repairs in excess of $30m. “The bill for fixing embankments and other assets is likely to reach $39m,” he said. “We could be looking at a figure greater than $100m to repair and future-proof the city … [the] government needs to help.” On the NSW south coast, gaping potholes were littered across the Princes Highway, winding from Shellharbour to south of Batemans Bay.

A full assessment of the extent of the damage was still taking place, with repairs expected to take days in some hard-hit areas that remained cut off. The Shoalhaven mayor, Amanda Findley, said road conditions were expected to further deteriorate with more rain forecast. “We are doing our best to keep up with the need for essential roadworks,” she said. “We are asking motorists to be patient while the extent of damage is being assessed.” Wattamolla Road near Woodhill Mountain, a Berry resident wants people to see the gravity of the road damage so they don’t drive out that way pic.twitter.com/dFsK5slXVl The Murwillumbah district chamber of commerce president, Rebecca Whan, said she was “shocked” by how long it had taken for assistance to arrive when the extreme weather hit. In the first 48 hours of the floods, she said Tweed – despite being 20km from the Gold Coast – was a ghost town, with no road access or phone reception. “We have big landslips all over the shire and enormous damage – some areas are still inaccessible,” she said. “The 2017 flood road damage cost was $27m here in Tweed alone, and this will be much higher this time.” A Tweed council spokesperson said there were four major landslips in the shire that were expected to close roads for “many months” while repairs were undertaken. “The repair list is likely to exceed the 1,600 jobs required after the 2017 flood,” the spokesperson said. The Byron mayor, Michael Lyon, said his shire was facing a damages bill to repair roads and bridges in excess of $100m. “Many of our community have lost everything,” he said. “The initial package isn’t enough … we are facing some major infrastructure issues.” More than 45 NSW councils hardest hit had received an initial $1m under the jointly funded state and federal government Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements. Emergency works needed to be done to repair roads are paid for out of the DRFA fund. But less severe damage, such as potholes, are funded by councils. The state Greens MP David Shoebridge said it was “hard to understand” why Lismore city council had received a blanket $1m payment despite being the epicentre of the flood crisis. It had been estimated infrastructure damage would cost upwards of $400m to repair in the devastated region. “Lismore city council has been smashed by flood. Machinery lost, buildings destroyed, roads ruined,” Shoebridge said. “So far it’s got the same payment from the state government as Bayside council in Sydney.” Turley said she expected the initial payment would be followed by further funding. “It is still uncertain how long it will take for councils to rebuild their communities,” she said. “Right now, our mayors, councillors and council staff are out on the frontlines fighting to save homes and businesses in their communities, including their own. It’s really, really tough out there, and when the water subsides the hard work of cleanup and recovery begins.” Fifteen local government areas in south-east Queensland are also dealing with the impact of catastrophic flooding. “Full assessment of the damage is yet to be completed,” the Local Government Association of Queensland said on Friday. “Councils like North Burnett have over 3,000km of unsealed roads and there is significant damage to many of those.” Queensland’s Department of Transport and Main Roads said: “Damage assessments will continue over coming months and a significant program of reconstruction works will be required. A budget for road repairs will be allocated once the full extent of damage is known.” Brisbane Valley Highway remains closed at Geoff Fisher Bridge, north of Fernvale.The bridge has been underwater for several days, with high water levels from dam releases receding slower than expected. pic.twitter.com/4Ug0UMOUhT Some of our *hundreds* of heroes from the past few weeks...When major flooding hit Gatton Lockyer Bridge a few weekends ago, Les & colleague Paul were quick to arrive at the bridge to remove debris and repair the road pavement that had been ripped away by the deluge. pic.twitter.com/k4oOkGyjAg",News/Australia news,"Roads ripped apart by NSW and Queensland floods must be rebuilt stronger, councils say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/roads-ripped-apart-by-nsw-and-queensland-floods-must-be-rebuilt-stronger-councils-say
3/12/2022,"Outside this anteroom at the University of Queensland is a stock standard laboratory where, like most labs around the world, plastic is ubiquitous. The bench tops are laminated, there are plastic tubs and bottles everywhere and staff walk around in lab coats made from synthetic fibres. There is plastic in the air, on the floor and scientists drink out of it. But in here, through a tightly sealed door, there is virtually none of the stuff. Through another door, in an air-locked corridor, scientists walk in, plastic-free, ready to enter a laboratory space that is unlike any other in the world. Here, the insulating wall panels are made from aluminium. The floor, ceiling and walls are made from steel that is welded to avoid the use of silicone or plastic joins. The air-filters are made from paper. “Affectionately, it’s called the submarine,” says Prof Kevin Thomas, the director of UQ’s Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences. Inside this metal box – just 12 sq metres in size and funded by the foundation of the mining billionaire, Andrew Forrest – scientists hope to answer one of the world’s most pressing environmental questions: is plastic, and the multitude of chemicals that go with it, getting into the tissues in our bodies? And if it is, are humans being harmed? “A normal lab is full of plastics and the chemicals used to make them. They’re abundant,” says Thomas. “But I don’t know if we can say that they’re dangerous yet. But I want to know.” One fundamental problem that scientists studying exposure to plastics face is that even in a laboratory, there is a risk their samples are being contaminated during their experiments. If they find nano-sized plastics and chemicals in a tissue sample, they can’t be confident how it got there. Was the sample exposed during the everyday life of a human, or did the plastic get there during the testing? This lab, says Thomas, aims to almost completely eliminate plastic so that samples can be extracted inside a special steel cabinet, then sealed in glass and moved outside to a piece of kit called a mass spectrometer. “If you put two spoonfuls of sugar in eight olympic swimming pools, this could detect it,” says Thomas, pointing to a mass spectrometer with a sticker on it. “My Name Is NEGU,” the sticker reads. NEGU stands for “Never, Ever Give Up,” a catchphrase of Forrest, its benefactor. Two weeks ago, Forrest also stood in the contamination-controlled lab to inspect the space. His Minderoo Foundation has pumped $3.2m into the equipment, and added another $1.3m to support the scientists that will do the work. Scientists in the lab – part of Minderoo’s Plastics and Human Health centre at UQ – have already started working with blood, urine and brain tissues, fine-tuning their methodology ready for the start of the first tests, likely to be on human urine. Thomas says they are working at sizes below 10 microns (one micron is one-1,000th of a millimetre). “That’s the size range that is feasible to cross biological barriers,” he says. Humans and other living things around the world are exposed to plastic all the time. It is in the water that we drink, the food that we eat and the air that we breathe. It’s likely, Thomas says, that it is in our lungs and stomach even as we do this interview. But is it being absorbed in our body? About four years ago, Thomas started an experiment on human blood, but the amount of plastic in the sample of blood was the same as a blank sample. “We didn’t know if it was coming from the blood or the lab, so we parked that work,” he says. During a workshop last year with the Minderoo Foundation, Thomas says there was much disagreement. Some scientists rejected any suggestion that plastic or the associated chemicals could make their way into human tissues. Some – like Thomas – admitted they didn’t know, while at least one was utterly convinced the chemicals and plastics were already in our tissues. The UQ and Minderoo team started to design the lab two years ago, sourcing as many plastic-alternative materials as possible. A “PVC-free” floor covering turned out not to be PVC-free. But Thomas says tests in the lab’s environment have so far found no evidence of plastics or their associated chemicals – such as phthalates and bisphenols – below 500 nanometres (one sheet of paper is about 100,000 nanometres thick). Prof Sarah Dunlop, who leads the plastics and human health work at the Minderoo Foundation, says: “There is so much public attention on microplastics but I think that is because we can see them. Our exposure to them is staggering. “For nanoplastics – the reason we don’t know much about them is because it is so hard to measure. But is it linked to health impacts? We know they’re out there and we know about the risk. “But this is about establishing whether or not there’s harm and then using that to drive change.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While the “submarine” is cutting the chances of experiments being compromised, the team are also working with other scientists that are collecting samples, including the Sydney Brain Bank, to develop protocols to reduce the chances of plastic contamination during collection. The task is mammoth, but Dunlop says getting an answer to the question of whether plastic is harming humans is like a scientific “holy grail”. “People see plastic as a waste problem but not about the pollution inside our bodies – inside our children’s bodies – or how it might change how our brains develop. But that is what it is to be human.”",News/Environment,Plastic-free ‘submarine’ helps Queensland scientists find if nanoplastics are inside us,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/12/plastic-free-submarine-helps-queensland-scientists-find-if-nanoplastics-are-inside-us
3/12/2022,"A neurologist who resigned from a global sports concussion organisation amid allegations of plagiarism in a medical journal editorial has been accused of copying material in other articles without attribution. Dr Paul McCrory, who in 2016 described concussion among NFL players as “overblown” and has advised the AFL on the issue, stood down as chair of Concussion in Sport Group (CSIG) this week after the British Journal of Sports Medicine retracted the 2005 editorial, citing an “unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright” of the work of Prof Steve Haake. The CSIG receives funding from peak sporting bodies, including the International Olympic Committee and FIFA. McCrory was editor of the British Journal of Sports Medicine at the time his editorial was published. He was quoted on the website Retraction Watch on 4 March as saying he had requested the paper be retracted after realising an unfinished and unreferenced draft had been accidentally uploaded. “Not the final version, and as the draft was incomplete it failed to appropriately cite the original and excellent work of Professor Haake,” McCrory reportedly told Retraction Watch. “This was entirely my error which I did not pick up on at the time and I apologise. “I am in the process of removing any reference to the article on the various online manuscript databases. I am also rechecking the whole series of warmup articles that were uploaded at that time to see whether I have made the same error in other articles in the upload process.” McCrory, an honorary associate with the prestigious Florey Institute for medical research in Melbourne, has reportedly requested a second article be retracted from the same journal. He was quoted on Retraction Watch admitting a similar error had occurred. He said: “The errors were not deliberate or intentional but nevertheless require redress as what has been published is plagiarism. Once again I apologise for my error.” It is alleged about half of the article was copied from an article Haake wrote in 2000 for Physics Today. McCrory has also reportedly sought advice from the journal as to whether a third article should be retracted. He was quoted on Retraction Watch stating: “This [article] has the correct citations including the source material of the authors and the news article where the text came from, however the typesetting had not included the quotation marks in the text and not inserted the references in the text correctly.” He has not responded to requests from Guardian Australia for comment. Data analyst Nick Brown, who is affiliated with Linnaeus University in Sweden and reviews scientific papers for errors, told Guardian Australia that based on analysis he had done he believed it was not the first time McCrory may have plagiarised work. Brown has examined 10 more of McCrory’s published pieces published from 2002 onwards that appear to contain significant amounts of plagiarised work without attribution. These include articles by McCrory on concussion. McCrory did not respond to questions from Guardian Australia about Brown’s analysis. McCrory currently advises the AFL on its concussion policies. The AFL did not respond to Guardian Australia’s request for comment as to whether the plagiarism allegations concerned them or were leading to a review of their affiliation with him. McCrory has previously claimed the issue of concussion within the NRL was “overblown”. While he was with CSIG, the organisation developed the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, which is used to assess athletes with head injuries. Head injuries are of increasing concern in sport, with groundbreaking research into the long-term ramifications of concussion by the Australian Sports Brain Bank in February finding chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the brains of more than half of a cohort of donors, including three under the age of 35. McCrory is lead author of the 2nd to 5th international consensus statements on concussion in sport. In a lecture he delivered in 2016 to the Florey Institute on “Media, Myths and Medicine”, McCrory said “all the carry-on and hoo-ha you get from the United States” about the dangers of concussion were not nearly as serious as some reports had led the public to believe. He said the media was guilty of “over-simplifying” a complex topic. Dr Chris Nowinski is chief executive and founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, which supports athletes affected by concussions and traumatic brain injuries. In an article published on the foundation’s website, Nowinski argues that McCrory misinterpreted and accordingly misrepresented Boston University brain injury research during his 2016 Florey Institute lecture. During the lecture McCrory said Boston University researchers found about 4% of retired athletes get CTE. “The other way of looking at it is that 96% of athletes do not get it,” McCrory said. “Yet if you read the media, particularly from the United States, you get a very different perspective.” But Nowinski argues that misrepresents what the Boston University research found. The research examined prevalence of CTE in deceased professional American football players who died between February 2008 and June 2010, and of 321 known player deaths the brains of 12 underwent postmortem examination. All 12 showed evidence of CTE, suggesting an estimated lifetime prevalence of at least 3.7%, the study found. But the authors of the study also wrote this was a conservative estimate because only a small sample of deceased players brains had been studied. Given all of those that were examined had evidence of CTE, it suggests CTE is a serious public health issue, the authors wrote. Nowinski believes McCrory also misinterpreted the Boston University research in a 2013 publication where he wrote that if the 12 brains studied represented all CTE cases ever in the NFL, “the incidence rate would be less than 0.01%”. McCrory did not respond to questions about Nowinski’s assertions. Nowinski told Guardian Australia: “McCrory is the lead author of one of the most influential consensus guidelines through which global concussion and CTE prevention and policy efforts are built upon, and it is critical that those guidelines reflect the best science. “When any researcher has multiple articles retracted over a week, it raises concerns about all of their publications. I look forward to learning how Florey and other institutions he has worked with plan to address the revelations. “To quote Paul McCrory on plagiarism, ‘the price of trust is eternal vigilance’, and ‘the higher up the greasy pole of academia one climbs, the greater the fall when things go pear shaped’.” A Florey Institute spokesperson said Florey “treats all matters concerning scientific integrity with the utmost seriousness and in compliance with applicable rules and regulations”. A spokesperson for the University of Melbourne, also affiliated with McCrory, said the university was “currently reviewing the circumstances and determining next steps”. “The University of Melbourne upholds the highest levels of research integrity and rigour,” the spokesperson said. Dr Deborah Apthorp, a cognitive neuroscientist, said the allegations of plagiarism were concerning and that scientists need to be accountable because they were often funded to carry out research to benefit the public.

3/12/2022,"Two weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and China is still turning diplomatic cartwheels to prevent the war from damaging its global standing, while still preserving its strategic partnership with Moscow. China offers to mediate! China offers aid! China is “extremely concerned” about the safety of citizens! Xi mentions the word “war”! The plethora of headlines alone is evidence for how Beijing has been subtly shifting its language day-to-day to put some distance between itself and Moscow and its increasingly bloody military tactics. But for the moment, such protestations should be ignored. Beijing’s core message, especially the one tailored for its domestic audience and Moscow itself, is that it is standing by Russia, or perhaps more the point, against the US, which it continues to blame for the war. If there was ever any doubt as to Beijing’s authentic view, Zhao Lijian, the foreign ministry spokesperson and the most prominent voice of China’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy, provided it this week. Zhao attacked the US for secretly operating biological weapons labs in Ukraine. In doing so, he was echoing a conspiracy theory from Russia, for which there has been no evidence offered. Throughout, Beijing has not backed away from its core position, that Moscow has “legitimate security interests” in Ukraine. And like Moscow, state media in Beijing has labelled the US “an empire of lies”. Still, there is little doubt that Beijing is squirming under pressure, not just from the US, but also from Europe, Japan and Australia, to condemn the invasion. As Evan Feigenbaum, a former US government official and now head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington thinktank, observed, Beijing is struggling to settle on a clear message for the simple reason that it is trying to reconcile the irreconcilable. Beijing simultaneously wants to preserve its partnership with Moscow, stand by its longstanding policy of territorial integrity and non-interference in other states, and avoid being collateral damage in the war. “The more China leans to Moscow, the more it paints a target on its back for Washington and Brussels on the sanctions,” Feigenbaum said in the SupChina podcast. “Obviously, facts on the ground in Ukraine flatly contradict anything the Chinese government would like to say about respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Beijing doesn’t welcome the conflict and appears to have been taken aback by Vladimir Putin’s full throttle invasion, even though the Russian leader met with Xi Jinping days before the tanks headed across the border. Xi has been bedding down his own political system in readiness for the once-every-five-years Communist party congress at the end of the year, at which he is expected to seek a norm-busting third term. Xi neither needs nor wants any instability at such a sensitive moment. His many enemies have learned to shut their mouths in recent years lest they feel their leader’s wrath. But if the situation deteriorates in Ukraine and the conflict slides into a full-blown insurgency, Xi’s critics will have a stick to beat him with. After all, Xi and Putin have met nearly 40 times since 2012. For Xi not to have read the room and realised that Putin was readying a full invasion represents a failure on his part, and that of the Chinese system. Why then is Beijing standing by Moscow? It is important to remember that the “no limits” partnership signed in early February between the two leaders in Beijing was the culmination of a relationship two decades in the rebuilding. It is an unsentimental partnership but not a flash in the pan, and one which both countries have judged holds great value on multiple levels. Russia exports arms, energy and farm products, such as wheat, to China. China sends consumer goods in the other direction. Most importantly, both have an overriding interest in hobbling US power around the world, and in the European and Asian spheres in particular. Over time, Chinese support for Russia in Ukraine could be matched by Russian support for China in any crisis with Taiwan. They have already been running a parallel diplomatic strategy for years, according to which China allows Russia to take the lead in the Middle East, while Moscow buttresses Beijing in Asia. But the relationships has its pitfalls. Russia is by far the junior partner to a much larger China, the reverse of when the two countries were revolutionary comrades-in-arms in the 1950s. Beijing, for its own part, is finding itself hitched to a highly aggressive and unstable Russian leader, with little apparent ability to influence his actions. Beijing has also been courting Europe to split it from the US, with some success. Its position on Ukraine has instead sent this initiative into reverse, prompting renewed transatlantic bonding and demands from Brussels and other capitals that China withdraw support from Russia. If the conflict is still raging in six months, Beijing might not settle for a subtle re-positioning. Instead of taking fire for Moscow, it might start thinking of ways to put pressure on it as well.

3/12/2022,"Penny Wong won’t be fronting any of the election night television coverage this time around. Back in 2019, Labor’s Senate leader was on the ABC’s election night panel. As Labor lost the election it thought it would win, Wong had to sit, stoic, controlled, analysing the incoming shellacking for hours. Never again, she says. In a conversation for my podcast this weekend, Wong recalls one of her more terrible nights. She says she knew by 7.30pm Labor was not returning to government, because the scrutineers in Queensland were telegraphing a blow out. “I remember calculating how many hours I’d have to be on television before Bill [Shorten] conceded,” she says. The trauma remains deep etched, for Wong, and for Labor. Wong is on the podcast for a conversation about defence and foreign affairs, given Scott Morrison is fully intent on a khaki election. She raises election night in 2019 when I ask her how she is contemplating conducting foreign affairs differently, given oppositions always plan for a transition. Wong corrects my terminology. “We’re planning,” she says. After 2019, “I don’t contemplate. I plan for what we have to do without engaging in any assumption”. We are starting here this weekend because Wong’s summary neatly encapsulates Labor’s current mindset. Planning. Hoping, but after the 2019 rout, the opposition is too nervous to assume anything. But with the budget now in sight, and the campaign proper then under way shortly after, Labor is executing a gear change. A political party that thinks and moves as a collective, even during periods of maximum derangement, is entering the season of Anthony Albanese. Obviously Albanese has led his party for a full parliamentary term, steering colleagues past the trauma of the defeat, so when I say the season of Albanese, I mean Labor is about to learn whether or not the bloke up front can persuade voters he is the man for the moment. To this end, Albanese is assembling the components of his alternative prime minister story. There were two scene-setting speeches this week – one to a business summit arranged by the Australian Financial Review, and another to a foreign and defence policy related outing at the Lowy Institute. The spine of Albanese’s pitch to voters is “I represent safe change”. In that spirit, the Labor leader had two messages for the business community. The first was he planned to govern in the consensus style of Bob Hawke. The second was Labor had a growth and productivity agenda. Albanese would champion aspiration as well as fairness. At Lowy, Albanese wanted to project that he was a person who would bring a level of institutional seriousness back to the prime ministership. He told the foreign policy boffins he intended to “restore a greater sense of responsibility to the office of the prime minister”. Albanese also picked up some broken pieces from his near past. Asked by Lowy’s executive director, Michael Fullilove, to identify prime ministers he’d admired from a foreign policy perspective, Albanese eventually got to John Curtin (given Curtin, for Labor people, is always the correct answer). Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But first, he nominated Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. Albanese said he’d seen Rudd “up close” during his first G20 meeting in London during the global financial crisis, shuttling between Barack Obama and the Chinese delegation. “I saw Australia punching above our weight,” he said. Albanese said Rudd had yanked Australia out of “the naughty corner” in global forums by ratifying the Kyoto protocol. Lest anyone be accused of having a favourite sibling, Albanese added: “The relationship Julia Gillard forged with president Obama was extraordinary. It led to Julia addressing Washington in a celebrated address, and a great honour for our country, and it led to the increased presence of US Marines in the Northern Territory.” These reflections felt sincere, but they were also very obviously didactic and rehabilitative. Albanese wanted to project a sense of competence from the recent past – a past in which he’d been a significant actor. Rudd/Gillard/Rudd wasn’t all civil war was his point. That government I was part of wasn’t all rank self-indulgence. We did things too. In addition to the speeches, Albanese has done the obligatory Women’s Weekly profile – a rite of passage for any prime ministerial aspirant. This Sunday, a let’s meet the “real Albo” 60 Minutes special will bookend Jenny Morrison, Morrison and his ukulele a couple of weeks back. So you can see where this is all going. But it’s also reasonable to wonder at this juncture why it has taken the Labor campaign so long to colour between the lines. The simple question is this: why is Operation Define Not At All Scary Albo running so late in the political cycle when opinion polls tell us there’s a reasonable chunk of voters who haven’t yet formed a view about the Labor leader? If we cast our memories back to 2007, when Kevin Rudd took on John Howard, and won, Rudd was out telling voters “a number of people have described me as an economic conservative” a full five months before the election.

I bet you do. They are entirely memorable in the sense that peak chutzpah always is. Because Rudd’s serene humblebrag was so ludicrously audacious, the advertisements became a cultural conversation piece, generating a bunch of free media follow-up. Rudd had wanted to lure the Liberals into talking more about him, so that campaign was more than introductory. It was bait, and the bait worked. Now obviously Albanese does talk about his values and background frequently. There have also been a couple of dry run marketing prototypes. In March 2021, there was the “Albo’s story” montage prepared for the ALP national conference. Then in December 2021, for a rally in Sydney’s inner west, there was the “better future” pitch. But neither of those pitches were pushed out forcefully across social media, radio or television to voters who only watch politics out of the corner of their eyes. For weeks, I’ve been wondering when that might change. Given the log cabin narrative is such a basic building block in professional campaigning, the absence has felt deliberate. I’ve wondered whether Albanese has resisted traditional mass market definitional efforts because, fundamentally, he prefers ambiguity. Albanese has prospered this long in politics, in part, because he knows how and when to dance between the raindrops. I haven’t been the only person curious. Some Liberals have also been scratching their heads. Is this a lack of money? Is this some kind of deep, risk aversion? In any case, Morrison, of course, is never one to die wondering. The prime minister has sought to exploit the opening Albanese has left by moving to define the Labor leader himself. If you watch politics closely, you’ll know Morrison’s efforts on this front have intensified significantly over this past month or so. Albanese is weak, and sneaky. The Labor leader is Beijing’s preferred candidate for the election. And so on. From my vantage point, the tone of this desperate barrage landed somewhere between hyperbole and hysteria. But Morrison isn’t talking to me, he’s talking to the disengaged voters that determine the outcome of elections, and some of these people would struggle to identify Albanese in a line-up. People who conduct focus groups for a living, whose judgment I trust, tell me people are deeply angry with Morrison at the moment, but they are not yet volunteering a positive assessment of Albanese in the way voters did, unprompted, about Rudd in 2007. Given Morrison is currently on the rampage, firing indiscriminately, it would make sense for Labor to call time on strategic ambiguity, if this is, in fact, a strategy. Apparently that’s about to happen. People say a campaign defining the Labor leader and the coming contest is hovering in the wings. I suspect it will surface over the coming week or two, on all major mediums. Albanese has copped a fair bit of flak since taking the leadership for playing it safe. But if the polls are right, the leader’s political instincts and judgments have, thus far at least, kept Labor in the contest, at a time when the power of incumbency should wipe any political insurgency off the map. So perhaps he’s right to have left colouring in between the lines this late in the political cycle. Perhaps it’s best to wait until people are fully tuned in. But if Labor loses because voters ultimately don’t feel as if they have a grip on the Morrison alternative – and therefore aren’t confident Albanese means safe change – holding back will have been a big judgment call to get wrong.",News/Australia news,"After the trauma of defeat, it makes sense for Labor to play it safe.

3/12/2022,"The federal government has asked a multinational fertiliser company to stop work on plans to remove Indigenous rock art from a world heritage-nominated area in the Burrup Peninsula after traditional owners raised concerns. Perdaman is planning to build a $4.5bn fertiliser plant in Western Australia’s Burrup Peninsula. The company is already contracted to buy gas used to make the fertiliser from Woodside Energy’s Scarborough gas field. The plant has been strongly supported by both the Western Australian and federal governments, with $255m given to the company to build water and marine infrastructure nearby. Building the plant would, however, require the removal of rock art at three sites. The company has been given approval by the Western Australian government to go ahead with the removal but it is understood it does not yet have the work approvals required to start. The Burrup Peninsula in the Pilbara – known as Murujuga to traditional custodians – is also an outdoor gallery home to over a million examples of Indigenous rock art produced over a period of 50,000 years. The area was nominated for a world heritage listing in 2018. If successful, this would mean the area is protected in the same way as the pyramids of Giza, Stonehenge and the Taj Mahal. While Perdaman has claimed to have the full support of the traditional owners to remove the art, this has been contested. Raelene Cooper, a Mardudhunera woman and former board member of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, said elders and members of the community had been misinformed about the nature of work. “The elders never approved this,” Cooper said. “They had no understanding of it. No one had ever explained to them what was really going on. “I mentioned that they were going to start removing the rock art and said they don’t want that. They said so repeatedly.” Perdaman was contacted for comment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cooper and another custodian, Josie Alec, wrote to Australia’s environment minister, Sussan Ley, asking her to use emergency powers under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to stop the rock art removal. In response, the federal environment department asked Perdaman not to go ahead until a review can be carried out. A spokesperson for Ley said the department would review the application to remove the art “as soon as possible”. “At this time the scheduling of works remains a matter for the proponent who must meet all conditions including those relating to the protection of Indigenous cultural heritage,” the spokesperson said. Cooper said the situation had a renewed urgency after the inquiry into the destruction of sacred sites at Juukan Gorge following international outcry. “It’s quite concerning the government would support us in a way with world heritage nomination with all the rock and history, and then turn around, putting a $4.5bn plant in there and remove that history,” Cooper said. “I find it astonishing.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app As well as physical destruction of the rock art by removal, there are also concerns about the cumulative effect of air pollution from increasing industrial development in the area. The University of Western Australia honorary research fellow John Black said air pollution from gas production and other industrial operations builds up on the rock face, where it makes the surface more acidic, causing the paint to break down. “The main problem with urea is that it provides a nitrogen source for microbes and those microbes produce organic acids,” Black said. “The thing about the Murujuga environment is that it was extraordinarily deficient in nitrogen. The only organisms that use to live [in] them were able to convert nitrogen from the air into biological form. “Now what we’re doing is providing various forms of nitrogen as pollution.”",News/Australia news,Fertiliser company urged to halt plans to remove Burrup Peninsula Indigenous rock art,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/fertiliser-company-urged-to-halt-plans-to-remove-burrup-peninsula-indigenous-rock-art
3/12/2022,"The sudden death of the popular Labor senator Kimberley Kitching in Melbourne on Thursday cast a pall over our nation’s capital and shocked politicians from across the spectrum. Tributes surfaced on social media almost immediately after news of her passing. Liberals feted Kitching as a “patriot” and a “warrior”. Labor colleagues, many still in a fog of incomprehension, struggled to process their feelings and shed tears. Kitching will be remembered as an engaging and warm woman, with many deep friendships, a knowing smile, a quick wit, and a wicked sense of humour. She was also a longtime player in the bitterly contested crucible of Victorian Labor politics. In the characteristic way of politics, and power, where friends can be frenemies and then friends again, some colleagues had complicated histories with her. The Victorian rightwinger was still junior in Canberra’s parliamentary pecking order, having entered the Senate in 2016, but being a keen political player, she enjoyed public prominence. After arriving in Canberra, Kitching forged a reputation for her work in foreign affairs and defence, and on human rights. She was a committed foreign policy hawk – an enthusiastic member of the “Wolverines” – a cross-party group of parliamentarians campaigning for a tough stance against China. Kitching controversially used parliamentary privilege in a Senate hearing only last month to name the alleged “puppeteer” behind a Chinese foreign interference plot foiled by the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation. Mike Burgess, the head of Asio, refused to answer Kitching’s question and told her it was “unfair that you ask me that question in public”. Kitching was close to the Liberal senator James Paterson, a fellow Victorian, and a fellow Wolverine, who chairs the joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security. After news of her death became public, Paterson described Kitching as “a warrior for her cause, a friend of freedom and a true patriot who had an enormous impact in her short time in the Senate”. Accompanying her interest in foreign affairs, intelligence matters and defence, Kitching was also one of the driving forces for Australia to adopt Magnitsky-style laws, allowing targeted sanctions against foreign officials. Her work in spearheading the adoption of these laws – which have been deployed in the current sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine – saw her win a major human rights award last year. One of her closest friends and confidantes was the former Labor leader Bill Shorten. When she entered the Senate, it was to replace another long-term ally, the rightwinger Stephen Conroy. Born in Brisbane, and a friend of Shorten’s wife, Chloe, since childhood, Kitching studied law and was admitted as a solicitor. She later moved to the private sector, working in corporate roles, before serving on Melbourne city council. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Kitching’s time as general manager of the Health Services Union came under scrutiny during the royal commission into trade unions, with the commissioner, Dyson Heydon, ruling in an interim report that she had sat the right-of-entry tests “on behalf of one or more of” seven other union officials, including the secretary Diana Asmar. Kitching denied the claims. Heydon recommended the commonwealth director of public prosecutions consider prosecuting Asmar and five others for making false statements about the tests, and Kitching for aiding and abetting those contraventions. Charges were not pursued. In 2015, the Fair Work Commission also noted that Kitching had given “untruthful and unreliable evidence” – a point that the Senate noted in 2016 upon her entry to parliament, after a motion from the Liberal senator Eric Abetz. Kitching served in numerous Labor branch roles in Melbourne in the 2000s, and vied for the lower house seats of Lalor and Gellibrand, before joining the Senate. Her candidacy was hotly contested and controversial, with some Labor members privately opposing Kitching’s elevation, but she was eventually elected unopposed by members to the casual vacancy. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, reportedly threatened to resign if she was appointed, while Anthony Albanese – then a Labor frontbencher, now party leader – refused to back her at the time. Albanese said the situation made the case “for ensuring that members have votes in Senate preselections”, which he said should be “a part of party reform”.

A grief-stricken Shorten said on Friday his friend had been under considerable stress. “Preselections are never easy,” he told the ABC. “I’m not a coroner, I can’t tell you why this woman at 52 was taken from us, but I have no doubt the stress of politics and the machinations in the back rooms had its toll. “She’s a very strong person. She could give as good as she could get. But you take it all home with you, don’t you? Stress is like invisible coats of paint. It’s got to be having its impact. And she was greatly stressed.” Albanese, asked in an ABC TV interview on Friday about the preselection issue, said “politics is a difficult business”. “There are pressures on people in politics. And that is part of what we do. But I certainly think that this was totally unexpected. No one could have anticipated this,” he said.

3/12/2022,"The first thing that hits you is the smell – the reek of overflowing sewage, rotting animal corpses in the river, decaying vegetable matter, toxic waste, all the things the flood brought up. It gets into your skin that smell. Under a low grey sky in bacterial heat, the town of Coraki is a wasteland, a dystopian nightmare. In the air above us, helicopters drag bales of hay across the brown inland sea that surrounds the town. Piled high outside almost every house, are belongings encased in sludge and mud, the entire lives of the occupants. No one has escaped this disaster. People are still very raw. Coraki is where the Richmond and Wilson rivers meet and the area felt the full brunt of both flooded rivers. On Monday 28 February firefighter Shane Cox was wading around in the water helping people, when he says it “went up another 2 metres”. Dominique Sorrenson had about 4% battery left on her phone when she put a Facebook post up to let people know she was at her house. A power surge had come through her home and cut off her electricity. “I had my elderly father who had health conditions, the next morning a boat rocked up and picked us up because of my Facebook friends,” she says. Coraki was marooned for five days by flood water and residents were forced to fend for themselves without help or supplies. The army broke through on Sunday. People’s legs are cut and bruised from being in contaminated water full of sharp objects. There is a risk of mosquito borne diseases. Electricity has started coming back on in some houses, but the internet is still sporadic. People are living on the streets, under tarpaulins, disoriented, despairing, running on adrenaline. “Everyone,” says volunteer Sharsha Witthahn, “is tired and broken”. The outlying communities are still in the rescue phase. On Thursday private boats were being loaded and launched with provisions and medical supplies for those still out there. For the first time paramedics were on board, after volunteers had become concerned about mental health issues. Volunteer Miriam Meyers says the paramedics were “administering tetanus shots, antibiotics for infections gotten from moving machinery and metal debris, dressing wounds”. “People are presenting with chemical burns because of leaking diesel,” she says. Kate Coxall, a reporter with the Lismore App, a former volunteer firefighter and a trained support facilitator, had thought she might be “overzealous” when she evacuated her daughter and dog from her house at nearby Bungawalbin to her neighbours on Sunday 27 February. “I just felt something was wrong, I moved my landlord’s cows that day from thigh-deep water to the top paddocks,” she says. Returning to her house the next day, she says: “I was absolutely shocked.” She waded through 1.5 metre-deep water to rescue her chickens. On the way back to her neighbour’s house Coxall says she saw a family of five carrying an outboard motor and a boat trying to get to Coraki, nearly 20km away. Some of them were shoeless, one had a big gash on his head. “We begged them, ‘please stay with us, it’s not safe,’ the waters at this point were raging,” she says. “They didn’t listen, and then an hour later we saw an urgent message for emergency services because they had chained themselves in the tinny to a tree.” Coxall spent several hours frantically trying to get help for them before hearing they had been rescued. At her neighbour’s house, the water kept rising. Coxall had left a flashing torch on a fence post, deck lights on and had been waving at passing choppers but they were missed in the cloud cover. They were there for two days with a ladder up against the roof, her neighbour starting to get sepsis in her foot. “There is nothing worse than feeling like you have been left and forgotten and accounted for as collateral damage,” Coxall says. When the ADF chopper finally came she had to leave her dog behind. “She tried to follow us, I will never forget her face.” From the moment she landed in Lismore Coxall was trying to get her dog and other people’s pets rescued. “Gathering GPS coordinates, addresses, numbers of people, numbers of animals and all that sort of thing,” she says. “Organising choppers and going out on boats myself. For us, it is day 14 and we’re still doing rescues.” A few days after her own rescue, her dog was brought out by a private chopper helping in the area. And Coxall, who has lost everything, remains indefatigable in helping the community still out there. “The water is only dropping half a meter each day and … we’ve only lost 5 metres of height,” Coxall says. “If there is more rain they could be out there for another two weeks easily. “Most [locals] have no vehicles left. One of them had a severe back injury, he couldn’t move, he’s there by himself with five dogs. It took us two days to get medication to him. “We’ve got people with cuts, we’re worried about septicaemia and people self-treating with whatever they can get from neighbours. I’m worried about people’s mental and physical health. I’m seriously worried about anyone who may have a time sensitive injury, there are so many brown snakes out there.” Most of the properties are on 100-acre blocks run by tough and stoic people. “They will say other people are worse off than us and they are in a really shit situation,” volunteer Meyers says. “There are people on remote properties who are not on social media, they don’t have the resources to ask for help. If you are not on Instagram no one is going to turn up to help.” Coxall agrees: “Yesterday we suddenly found out that there was a family under tarps with nothing. It is not even as though we have accounted for everybody yet. And that is what is terrifying. We think there are at least 50 people out there.” Some people are choosing not to leave their properties because they have horses and cattle to look after. “They don’t know where they would even go,” Coxall says. “At this point it is about welfare. They are in ankle deep water, none of them are taking care of themselves. They are all troopers, reclusive, they don’t want the fuss. But I can tell you for sure, they are very happy when they see you on the boat.”",News/Australia news,"Where the Richmond and Wilson rivers meet is Coraki, and people there have lost everything",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/where-the-richmond-and-wilson-rivers-meet-is-coraki-and-people-there-have-lost-everything
3/12/2022,"The Morrison government’s plan to restore its power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens has been criticised as “disrespectful and wrong” and a “significant step backwards” in the recognition of Aboriginal societies. Both claims are made in submissions to an appeal by the federal government to overturn the landmark Love and Thoms decision. In February 2020 the high court held in a four-three split that Aboriginal Australians were not aliens for the purpose of the constitution and could not be deported. In November, the federal court ordered the release of Shayne Montgomery, finding it was “not reasonable” to conclude the New Zealand citizen was not Aboriginal because, although he lacked biological descent from an Aboriginal person, he had been culturally adopted as Aboriginal. In its appeal against that decision, the government has sought leave to overturn Love and Thoms, which has resulted in at least 10 people being released from immigration detention since it was handed down. Montgomery’s bid to resist that has been bolstered by interventions by the Victorian government, the Australian Human Rights Commission, National Native Title Council and the Northern Land Council. Montgomery’s lawyers submitted that the commonwealth’s claim there is no clear common reasoning between the four judges in the majority in Love and Thoms “is both disrespectful and wrong”. They contended the point of Love and Thoms “is clear and easy to understand: Aboriginal Australians … have such bonds of attachment to this nation and its territory” that they cannot be subject to the “disabilities of aliens”, such as visa cancellation. They argued the commonwealth was “no more than [a] disappointed litigant”, warning that the “certainty of our legal system would collapse” if the fact the four majority judges expressed their reasoning differently were used to reconsider the precedent. “The appellants … just do not like the result which they obtained from this court.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “That dislike gives them no claim or right to disrupt the legal certainty and authority flowing from the decision of this court.” Montgomery’s lawyers also rejected the commonwealth’s claim that the decision threatens to confer “political sovereignty on Aboriginal societies”, arguing it does not give legislative or constitutional power to Aboriginal societies to determine who is a non-alien. NNTC argued that it should be a matter for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to decide “in any context, who is or who is not an ‘Aboriginal Australian’”. The NNTC described Love and Thoms as a protection against being found to be “aliens” and “like” the second Mabo native title decision “an important step” in the journey to recognise Indigenous connection to Australia and the “enduring authority of tradition law and custom in Aboriginal societies”. “The appellants’ submissions, if accepted, would remove that protection, and – fundamentally – take a significant step backwards in that journey.” The AHRC sought to intervene, warning in its submissions that restoring the power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens would “adversely affect the fundamental rights and interests of individuals” including the “serious interferences with the right to personal liberty”. Overturning the case “may permit a larger group of Indigenous Australians to be permanently removed from Australia”, it said. The AHRC noted the fact that Indigenous births are registered at lower rates than non-Indigenous births, suggesting that people entitled to Australian citizenship who cannot prove they or a parent were born in Australia could be found to be aliens. The Victorian government argued the commonwealth is seeking to “make the same arguments that a majority of the court rejected approximately two years ago”. Although two judges in the majority have retired since the decision, Victoria warned that a change in the composition of the court “is not and never has been reason enough” to overrule previous judgments. The Northern Land Council backed Montgomery’s case that the category of non-citizen non-alien should be extended to those culturally adopted as Indigenous, because descent is determined by cultural not genetic factors in Aboriginal societies. The NNTC also argued that, since not all Aboriginal Australians are native title holders, “some other test or standard” should be used to determine who is a non-citizen non-alien. On Wednesday the high court heard Brendan Thoms’ case about whether his detention was unlawful, which could expose the commonwealth to claims of compensation by non-citizen non-aliens who were detained before the February 2020 high court decision. The Montgomery case is expected to be heard in early April, although Montgomery has sought to have the case permanently stayed.",News/Australia news,‘Disrespectful and wrong’: lawyers slam Coalition’s push to restore power to deport Aboriginal non-citizens,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/disrespectful-and-wrong-lawyers-slam-coalitions-push-to-restore-power-to-deport-aboriginal-non-citizens
3/12/2022,"Small and crudely-formed, the hidden tunnel at Whiskey 108 almost went undetected. Concealed under a pile of grass, it might never have been discovered save for the forensic attention of an Australian SAS boot. But now that simple tunnel – and most critically, if anybody was found inside it – has emerged as a crucial inflection point upon which the defamation trial brought by Ben Roberts-Smith could turn. Roberts-Smith, the recipient of Australia’s highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. For all the complexity of this case, a key question in its outcome will be a very simple one: were there any people inside the tunnel at Whiskey 108? Two irreconcilable versions of events have emerged around that tunnel. Roberts-Smith has repeatedly told the court the tunnel contained a cache of arms, but no people. Four times during his evidence to court, Roberts-Smith has told Justice Anthony Besanko “there were no men in the tunnel”, or “there were no people in the tunnel”. But so far this trial, five SAS soldiers – some still serving – have told the court they saw men pulled from the tunnel. The presence of those men, or otherwise, is key because of what is alleged to have happened next. The newspapers claim the two men pulled from the tunnel were later murdered: one, a disabled man with a prosthetic leg, was allegedly machine-gunned by Roberts-Smith himself, his leg later souvenired by another soldier as a ghoulish trophy of war, a drinking vessel for celebrating soldiers; the other, an elderly man, was allegedly executed by another soldier on Roberts-Smith’s orders, a “blooding” of a new trooper. Roberts-Smith denies this ever happened, says it could never have happened, because there was never anybody in the tunnel. Whiskey 108 was the name given by the SAS to a compound in the village of Kakarak, a known stronghold and arms base for Taliban insurgents on the western side of the Dorafshan River in Afghanistan’s southern Uruzgan province. Australian SAS troops had been “outside the wire” in the province for several days before they received an order, late in the afternoon of 12 April 2009, to move on Whiskey 108. An airstrike was called in, a bomb dropped into the middle of the compound, and they fought their way through the river valley’s “green zone”, killing at least two insurgents en route, to the perimeter of the mud-walled compound. After the fight-through to secure the compound – which passed without significant incident – the patrol commanders gathered in a courtyard, amid the rubble of the bombed-out compound, to plan the next phase of the operation. It was then that one soldier, moving a pile of grass to check what lay beneath, discovered the entrance to a tiny tunnel. Straight away, the Australian soldiers had their guns trained down the hole. It is here that the versions of events described to the court diverge, and part irreconcilably. The testimony from six SAS soldiers has focused on what happened next at Whiskey 108. Five soldiers have said they saw people emerge from the tunnel, one has said he saw two Afghan men in the custody of Australian troops next to the tunnel entrance. The soldiers’ testimonies have not been identical. In some versions of events, Australian troops called themselves for anyone in the tunnel to surrender and come out, in others, the message was relayed through an interpreter, assisted by two Afghan women who had been detained in the compound. One soldier has told the court he put his head and shoulders inside the tunnel and saw two men inside. Another soldier, Person 43, said while he recalled there were two “persons under control” found at Whiskey 108, he had recollections he helped only one come out of the tunnel. He told the court he knelt down beside the tunnel to help drag the unarmed man out. “He started to stand up and I reached down and pulled him out. “He wasn’t resisting,” Person 43 said, “his hands were up in the universal ‘I give up’ position.” Another serving soldier, Person 40, said he watched two men emerge. “They were obviously very frightened. One had a distinctive limp … immediately [upon] coming out of his tunnel he was lifting his trousers, pointing to his prosthetic leg, expecting some sympathy from the troops.” Person 40 said both men, whom he believed were Taliban, were searched, “and from there they were marched off to another area, by Roberts-Smith and Person 35 [another Australian soldier]”. “My understanding is that they would be TQed (tactically questioned), and Ben Roberts-Smith was the lead TQer on the ground.” Person 40 said he expected the men to be taken back to the Australians’ Tarin Kowt base: “That’s the SOP (standard operating procedure).” However, Person 40 told the court no prisoners were taken back to Tarin Kowt from that mission. He never saw the men alive again. One soldier, anonymised as Person 41, gave evidence to the court about an alleged execution at Whiskey 108. He told the court he was investigating a room inside the compound where he had discovered bomb-making materials and opium when he emerged into a courtyard to see Roberts-Smith and another soldier, known as Person 4, standing above a kneeling elderly Afghan male, near the entrance to a tunnel. Person 41 said: “RS [Roberts-Smith] walked down and grabbed the Afghan male by the scruff of his shirt.” He said Roberts-Smith walked the man about two metres until he was in front of Person 4, “then kicked him in the back of the legs behind the knees until he was kneeling down … RS pointed to the Afghan and said to Person 4 ‘shoot him’.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app Person 41 said he did not want to witness what he realised was about to occur, and stepped back into the room where he had previously been. He said he heard a muffled round fired from an M4 rifle – “I’ve fired thousands of those rounds and I know what they sound like”. He waited another “15 or so seconds” before stepping back into the courtyard. He said Roberts-Smith was no longer in the courtyard, but Person 4 was standing above the Afghan male, who was dead from a single bullet wound to the head. He inspected the body. “There was quite a lot of blood flowing from the head wound.” The two Australian soldiers did not speak. “He seemed to be in a bit of shock to me.” Person 4, subpoenaed as a witness by the newspapers, spent nearly a week in the witness box during this trial. While he was asked about other SAS missions he participated in, he was not asked – either by lawyers for the newspapers or for Roberts-Smith – about his actions at Whiskey 108. Person 41 also gave evidence about standing in a cordon outside the Whiskey 108 compound following the Australian fight-through, telling the court, as he stood guard, he saw Roberts-Smith “frog-marching” an Afghan man “by the scruff of his neck” away from the compound entrance. “He [Roberts-Smith] had his machine gun in his right arm … he then proceeded to throw the Afghan male down onto the ground. The Afghan male landed on his back. ‘RS’ then reached down and grabbed him by the shoulder and flipped him onto his stomach. Then I observed him lower his machine gun and shoot approximately three to five rounds into the back of the Afghan male.” “After he’d done that, he looked up and saw me standing there, and looked at me and said ‘are we all cool, we good?’. I just replied, ‘yeah mate, no worries’.” Another soldier was also in the cordon surrounding the compound. Person 14 said the light was fading when he heard heavy footsteps to his right. “As I turned my head to my right, there were three Australian soldiers and a black object, which was similar to a human, that was thrown to the ground.” Person 14 said the person made a thudding, “expulsion of air” noise as they hit the ground. “Then a soldier raised their Minimi F89 Para and fired an extended burst. It was loud, like a ‘BRRRRRT’ for one second.” “That person turned and walked away out of sight back into Whiskey 108.” Person 14 said he turned to his patrol’s second-in-command and said “what the hell what that?” He said he did not recognise the soldier who fired at the time. But Person 14 said the soldier who shot the man was wearing a distinctive new camouflage paint, worn only by one SAS patrol in action that day, the five-man team of which Roberts-Smith was a member. Person 14 later checked the body of the slain man – he had gunshot wounds to the centre of his torso and blood coming from his mouth and nose. Person 14 saw that the man had a prosthetic leg. Later in the day, Person 14 told the court he saw Roberts-Smith carrying the distinctive Minimi weapon at the troops’ lay-up point. “I saw who had the Para Minimi [machine gun],” he said. “It was Ben Roberts-Smith.” Roberts-Smith has been resolute in his evidence. In June last year, under cross-examination, he was repeatedly asked about what happened at Whiskey 108. Four times he told the court “there were no men in the tunnel” or “there were no people in the tunnel”. He said testimony that men were pulled from the tunnel was “completely false”. It is not disputed Roberts-Smith shot and killed the man with the prosthetic leg. Roberts-Smith told the court he killed the man because he was a threat to Australian troops. Roberts-Smith said he saw him, armed and running, and killed him in accordance with troops’ rules of engagement. Roberts-Smith told the court he was standing outside the compound when he saw the man, “not running directly at me, but coming on an arc”. “He had his hand over the top of the weapon, because he was carrying it down next to his body like that … hunched over, as in, running like that with his shoulders down.” Roberts-Smith said the other man killed at Whiskey 108 was also an insurgent, also armed, and killed in combat by another Australian soldier. Roberts-Smith said after he had killed the man with a prosthetic leg he had a weapons stoppage, as he was kneeling to fix it, another SAS soldier shot and killed the second man. “My assumption was it was someone in my team, so either Person 18 or Person 4 was my assumption, but I actually don’t know.” Under cross-examination, he was asked “this is a person who, on your account, saved your life? “Yes,” Roberts-Smith replied, but said, to this day, he does not know which soldier it was. In the witness box, Person 18 denied being involved in a firefight at Whiskey 108. Person 4 was not questioned on his actions at Whiskey 108. Under cross-examination, the SAS witnesses who have been questioned over Whiskey 108 over the past fortnight have been asked whether their memories of the mission are hazy or faulty, whether they have conflated Whiskey 108 with other operations, or whether their stories were confected out of malice to harm Roberts-Smith. They have denied those assertions, and reaffirmed their evidence. This trial has weeks left still to run. The newspapers are only partway through their witnesses. Roberts-Smith may call up to 20 witnesses-in-reply. He may even take the stand again himself in order to rebut some of the allegations against him, though he has already given his version of events at Whiskey 108.

3/12/2022,"Walking through rows of white-netted grapevines, Andrew Barnes pauses to lift the fabric and pick a syrah grape. Originally, his idea had been to simply plant a few vines in his back yard. “I’d always wanted some grapes on a property,” he says. But the project snowballed: He leased one vineyard, then two. “We realised suddenly that we were producing a huge amount of wine – it had gone from being what was having a few grapes on the property to a wine lake,” Barnes laughs, looking around at the hillside of vines. “I’m flippin’ hopeless – it goes out of control.” Barnes, one of the pioneers of the four-day week, has an apparent penchant for projects that metastasise far beyond their original boundaries. As with grapevines, so with the four-day week. What began as an experiment with one of his own businesses in 2018 has expanded into a rapidly multiplying series of international pilots in Ireland, the US, UK, Israel, and Australia-Pacific regions, working with universities around the world to study the results. 4 Day Week Global, the non-profit Barnes co-founded with Charlotte Lockhart, is expecting to run trials with 300-500 companies internationally this year. Today, he is speaking from one of his vineyards on Waiheke Island, a tiny island off the north-eastern coast of New Zealand. On the scale of a globe, it’s a speck of land off the coast of a dot, and it is from here that Barnes hopes to transform the world of work and wrench the world of employment away from the deadlock of 40 hours. “There’s a lot of naysayers,” he says. “But there’s now a lot of evidence to say this works – so what’s to be lost in trying? Because you know, nobody ever advanced humankind by saying it’s not gonna work.” Around the world, the 4-day week movement has been gathering steam. Barnes was at the vanguard back in 2018, after reading an Economist article saying many workers were only productive for 1.5-3 hours a day. It struck him that by clawing back even one extra hour a day, the company would be more productive. Barnes decided to trial reduced hours for all 240 employees at one of his businesses, trusts firm Perpetual Guardian. He instituted an 80-100-100 rule: 80% hours, to accomplish 100% of the work, for 100% pay. The experiment worked. Productivity rose, staff were happier. He made the change permanent. Since then, the idea has only grown in popularity, Microsoft Japan trialled the concept in 2019 and said productivity jumped 40%. Unilever New Zealand announced a year-long trial of the four-day week in 2021; by the end of the year, they had opted to extend it. In Iceland, trials of a 35-hour work week run by Reykjavík city council and the national government included about 1% of Iceland’s working population. In Spain, the government accepted proposals for a pilot where the government would support a national private-sector trial of the four-day week last year. Barnes’ conviction has only solidified over time – if implemented properly, he says, it’s a no-lose proposition. A National Business Review rich-lister with a reported net worth of around $180m, he is adamant that it’s as much a business priority as a social one. “Right at the heart of this is a rational business decision,” he says, “as well as being probably one of the most socially responsible and environmentally responsible things you could do.” Gregarious and expressive, Barnes speaks with the conviction of an evangelist. His own approach and motivations were partly forged as a young investment banker in the UK, working punishing hours in a brutally competitive sector. In the years since, little seems to have changed at those firms – last year, a leaked internal survey from Goldman Sachs reported “inhumane,” abusive conditions and 100-hour weeks. In his memoir, Barnes denounces a culture that treats people like race horses: whipping them to do your bidding, running them down until they flame out. His own great conversion moment came in Sydney, where he had reached the coveted level of executive director at enormous global financial services group Macquarie. He loathed it. Walking along the city shoreline, a line from Nick Hornby’s book Fever Pitch kept running through his head: “You can’t remember whether life’s shit because Arsenal are shit, or the other way around.” “I hated my life. I hated everything,” Barnes says. “The question was, why do I hate Sydney? Do I hate Sydney because Sydney is awful? Or is Sydney awful because my life is awful?” He concluded it was the latter. Barnes left investment banking to take time off, and vowed not to replicate the culture at Macquarie, which he said encouraged overwork. Going forward, he says, “I adopted a philosophy that said: I would think about what Macquarie would do, and then do precisely the opposite.” Now, Barnes is seeking a revolution of the week as it currently stands. He sees it as a tired, unimaginative hangover of early 20th-century assembly lines: “an arbitrary construct based on repetitive manufacturing,” he says, leaning forward at one of the vineyard’s outdoor tables to run off a string of rhetorical questions. “What Henry Ford did in the 1920s – even then, why was it relevant to office work? Why was it relevant for agriculture? Why was it relevant for anything?” Barnes asks. “We decided to have a working week of 40 hours per week – who decided that was it? Why is that the pinnacle of human achievement?” Western societies have made various unsuccessful attempts to dislodge their routines from what historian David Henkin dubs our “recalcitrant calendar unit”. The Soviet Union spent more than a decade experimenting with the nepreryvka, a 5-day week without shared weekends. Post-revolution, the French attempted a 10-day week as part of a broader project to de-Christianise the calendar. Both failed to stick. The 40-hour working week, moored within its seven-day cycle, has proven startlingly stubborn. Any fundamental change to the way we arrange working time can be hard to get one’s head around, says Dr Laura Giurge, an assistant professor at London School of Economics, who studies time, wellbeing and the future of work. “The long-term benefits of just trying it can really outweigh any potential cost. So I think [the barrier] primarily could be psychological. It’s just the inertia: oh, I’m not gonna try because what I have now is doing OK.” For some managers, maintaining the status quo seems easier than having to establish new ways of measuring what a productive worker really is. “We’ve seen leaders staying a little bit in the past,” she says. “Because it’s really hard to measure performance nowadays, they continue to rely on old metrics of performance, such as valuing long work hours or instant responsiveness – as opposed to really focusing on what people actually do, and what’s the quality of the work that they do.” Giurge is a research affiliate of Oxford University’s wellbeing centre, where she works as part of the academic board for 4 Day Week Global, to assess the effects of their trials on productivity and worker wellbeing. She says there’s still more research to be done on increasing productivity in fewer hours. But broadly, the indications are positive. “Being able to disconnect from work and disengage from work and recharge is really beneficial not just for our wellbeing but also for productivity,” Giurge says. “We come back more engaged, we come back with more energy at work, and we’re less likely to make mistakes and we’re more motivated to put effort into the things that we care about.” That’s all very well if you’re drafting wills, or staring at a computer screen all day, or, for that matter, a CEO speaking from one of your sunny vineyards on Waiheke. But what about nurses, cleaners, shopkeepers and waiters – those for whom it’s harder to imagine 100% of work being accomplished in 80% of the hours? One of the criticisms of the four-day week is the extent to which the conversation has been dominated by the white collar sectors, the desk workers, those who tend to have existing layers of wealth and privilege. Barnes argues the potential for reduced hours is not restricted to white-collar workers – it just requires assessing different workplaces at systems level. “In things like retail, hospitality, it’s the two dynamics you’re looking at: do you get better output? But also, does your cost base change as a consequence of not having turnover, sick days, somebody not showing up … You have to look at it in the macro,” he says. Businesses currently lose huge amounts of money to staff turnover and burnout, sick days, disengaged employees, errors, and duplicated work. Studies have found, for example, that the full cost of replacing a nurse was between 30% and 130% of their salary. For other employees, Gallup puts the cost at between 20% and 200%. With the pandemic knocking the traditional workplace off its axis, reduced hours feel increasingly like an idea whose time has come. “Four Day Week has been given rocket fuel because of Covid,” Barnes says. There were two obvious effects: firstly, an enormous number of workers were sent to work from home – and time in the office was suddenly and forcibly disintegrated as a proxy for productivity. The second was that workers, freed from constant supervision, still seemed to do their work. “[It addressed] two of the big issues we always faced,” says Barnes. “How do I measure output? And how do I trust my workforce? Well, you sort of had that answer.” The third effect has been dubbed the great resignation: workers in the US left their jobs at historic rates toward the end of 2021, with a record 4.5 million quitting in November. In the UK, nearly 1.2m jobs were open, with many employers struggling for applicants. The reasons are complex, but the pandemic highlighted modern work’s unsustainable qualities – burnout, stagnating wages, lack of childcare, the need for work-life balance. Some employees are now in a position of market power, and demanding better. But most of the sweeteners that businesses offer employees – gym memberships or foosball or training or free lunches – aren’t highly motivating, Barnes says, because what appeals to one worker leaves another cold. Time, on the other hand, he says is endlessly personal: a person can use it for family, for hobbies, for rest, for side-hustles, for education. “When you give people back time, you individualise the incentive,” he says. “What I’m doing is I’m giving you the time, when you want it, so you can do the things that matter to you. And you can’t put a price on that.” Increasingly, it is the value of these things that Barnes seems fascinated by. In his own life, he has reached what might be considered capitalism’s heights: multimillionaire, serial entrepreneur, owner and director of global companies. But over time, it seems he has become increasingly convinced that those ends might not really what most of us are seeking. His own work, and success, he says, has come at a cost; two marriages, and children living on another continent. He launches into another string of rhetorical questions. “Is that good? Can I get that back? And why – because I decided that working was more important than absolutely everything else. Is it?” he asks. He answers himself: “Not really.” From amid the sunshine, the vines and luxury, he will keep working to extend to others the luxury he now particularly values – time.",Lifestyle/Money,The New Zealander trying to revolutionise the working week: ‘It’s a rational business decision’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/the-new-zealander-trying-to-revolutionise-the-working-week-its-a-rational-business-decision
3/12/2022,"As darkness descended on the northern rivers town of Ballina, a ragtag fleet of taxis, trucks and school buses began pulling up outside the town’s small hospital, ready to take part in an extraordinary mission. The 55-odd patients inside were in danger. Floods were inundating the northern rivers, and authorities believed the Richmond River would burst its banks, swelled by the basin’s unprecedented saturation and a looming high tide. The order was issued at 6pm on 1 March: the entire hospital was to be evacuated to a local high school, Xavier Catholic College in nearby Skennars Head. It meant moving palliative care patients, dementia sufferers, the immobile and stroke victims. Staff were given three hours to prepare. Among the three doctors on shift was Dr Katie Treble. The past 24 hours had sharpened her resolve. Treble, along with her dog, Jeff Bridges, had spent the previous day stuck on the roof of her inundated home in low-lying Mullumbimby. “I thought ‘no one predicted what happened in Mullum yesterday, and I’ve lost all my stuff, my house is under water and my car’s gone, so I’m not going to take any chances’,” she says. “There was no way I was having my patients go through what we went through.” The complexity of dismantling an entire hospital and setting it up again – at a school, of all places – in three hours is mind-boggling. Here, staff had to do it in the middle of a flood disaster, in the dark, knowing they might be overwhelmed by patients in coming days. Treble still isn’t sure who organised the vehicles. But they began to arrive at the hospital in numbers. So did the State Emergency Service, which offered to help however it could. School buses were used for patients who could walk. The hospital’s sickest were transported via ambulance. Taxis, trucks and SES vehicles were used to transport ultrasound gear, trolleys, air mattresses, huge stocks of medicines, bags of fluid, and airway equipment. Some patients were incredibly difficult to move. “A lot of them are confused, don’t understand what is going on, and a lot of them are pretty bed-bound too,” Treble says. Xavier College’s hall was transformed into a general ward using a sea of inflatable mattresses, each with an IV pole and stand. Taped to the end of each bed was a piece of A4 paper, recording a number and name for each patient. Monitors were run from batteries, and staff, lacking a usable IT system, converted all electronic records to paper form. A classroom was set up as the triage area for new patients, where a nurse waited for arrivals, standing in front of a two-by-two-metre screen, designed to give some semblance of privacy. The classroom whiteboards were used to track patients and outstanding jobs and orders. “It had the opportunity to be just a terrible shit-show, and it was the opposite,” Treble says. “It was slick and the communication between the team was good, I think everybody understood what role they had and the attitude of everybody was very much ‘can-do’ and ‘how do I help?’.” Another classroom was used as a resuscitation area. A GP clinic and mental health unit were set up in other parts of the school. Soon, the volunteers began to arrive. Doctors, nurses and hospital staff turned up in uniform, unpaid and unexpected, after hearing of the evacuation. Many, including emergency doctor Shaska Khosa, were arriving from extraordinary situations of their own. A day earlier, Khosa, who lives in Brunswick Heads, had launched a boat from a flooded street with her partner, Tom Lee Lewes, and joined a convoy of police rescue and surf lifesaving vessels to Mullumbimby. “We were just grabbing people from their houses and taking them up to slightly higher ground,” she says. Khosa arrived at the high school at 2am one morning, expecting to stay for six hours to help. She worked a 14-hour shift. There was no phone signal, she says, and some of the usual services a hospital relies on – including pathology – were nonexistent. The flood disaster had cut off access to other regional medical centres, leading to an influx to the high school. Somehow, though, the hospital worked.

The evacuation, like so much of what’s occurred in the northern rivers, was unprecedented. Neither Treble, who worked for Médecins Sans Frontières in Central African Republic, nor Khosa have ever been involved in anything like it. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone having to evacuate a hospital in three hours,” Treble says. “I’ve never heard of it, not in the developed world, anyway. “But we had an amazing team.”",News/Australia news,‘It was weirdly functional’: the inside story of the extraordinary evacuation of Ballina hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/12/it-was-weirdly-functional-the-inside-story-of-the-extraordinary-evacuation-of-ballina-hospital
3/12/2022,"Amy Clucas was 30 years old the first time she ever put on footy boots. The now-nurse grew up in Perth alongside her two sisters in a netball-oriented household, with a Sherrin nowhere in sight – a common tale for girls her age back then. Later in her adult years, she found herself spending a lot of time at Melville Rams Football Club due to her partner playing there, where interest in a women’s team was growing. Then last year, to help with numbers for the first female team that was emerging, she put on her trainers for a run around and “basically just fell in love”. Now, she’s the vice president of the club. Two of her main sources of motivation, she says, are Collingwood’s AFLW star Ash Brazill and former player Sharni Norder who, like her, both come from netball backgrounds. “Those two are definitely my two inspiring women in the AFLW,” she says. Clucas’s story is not wholly uncommon. The AFLW is often praised for inspiring the next generation of girls coming through the Australian rules football ranks, and is credited for the increasing rates of female kids taking up the sport. But it is not just the young ones the league is inspiring. Across Australia, the AFLW has spurred on vast amounts of women aged 20 and above to lace up footy boots for the first time and give what so many of them were denied as youngsters – because of their gender – a crack. Take Kelly Ford, 47, who grew up swimming, playing touch footy and tennis in Lakes Entrance, as Australian rules football was not an option for her. Two years ago, at the age of 45 and after having twins, she thought ‘why not?’ and joined her local footy club, Elsternwick Amateurs to learn the skills from scratch. She says the introduction of the AFLW “most definitely” has increased the participation rates of her club’s division, which feature mostly women in their late 20s to early 30s. “You see these women [AFLW players] and you go ‘Wow, look at these women…they’re doing what we all kind of always wanted to do’,” says Ford. “The girls, the culture down there, it’s just fantastic. And it just sort of gave me a bit of confidence – not that I was going to be any star player, because I wasn’t. But just give me a little bit more confidence in myself”. Then, there’s Kel Rowe, 34, who grew up in Brisbane dabbling in Aussie rules as a kid during high school, but gave it up after graduating because there weren’t any available options for her to continue. Fast forward to 2019, after she moved to Melbourne for work,, and she found herself in the stands for a Western Bulldogs v Geelong Cats AFLW game. “I remember going and sitting and watching this game and being like, ‘man, this is this amazing’. It immediately took me back to when I played footy as a kid, and as a teenager, and I was like, ‘I really want to do this again’.” So, she joined her local club, the Footscray Roosters, where she’s now also on the committee and helps out with social media. In that latter roles, she says that enquires from women aged 20 and above spike every year with the beginning of the AFLW season. At Queensland’s Sherwood Football Club, every year the women’s senior playing list sees a growth of around 20-30%, with players ranging from sixteen-year-olds through to women in their late 40s. Club president Andrew Thomson notes that before the advent of the AFLW, they had a women’s team as early as 1972, and from 2004 to 2014, but getting enough players and support made it difficult to maintain. “The introduction of the AFLW changed this completely,” he says, attributing increased support from local governing bodies, including funding and strategic planning. Women’s football director Lahnie Cooper agrees, saying the AFLW has had a flow-on effect where “local football teams are expanding”. Notably, this includes also putting the idea of playing footy themselves on the radar for a lot of women, who now have somewhere to sign up. “One thing a lot of new participants to the game that have come to us later in life have said is: ‘Now our daughters have been able to play the game and now I can play it as well’,” says Dr Adrian Raftery, general manager of AFL Masters, the division for players 35 years and over. “Age is just a number. We’re all five-year-olds. We’re just different sizes and shapes and maybe have a few more wrinkles.” He says that off the coattails of the AFLW’s inaugural season, AFL Masters developed a women’s division, which had three teams the first year, and has now grown to 12. The AFLW and all its players are making massive inroads when it comes to developing the sport in Australia, from grassroots up. And this includes motivating women in their 20s, 30s, 40s and above to take the sport up socially or competitively at their local clubs. “It’s the people who have never ever picked up a football, have wanted to, but have never had the confidence to do it… those are the ones that to me are the success stories,” says Cooper.",Sport/Sport,‘Age is just a number’: the women inspired by AFLW to take up footy later in life | Marnie Vinall,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/age-is-just-a-number-the-women-inspired-by-aflw-to-take-up-footy-later-in-life
3/12/2022,"Here’s Ky Furneaux, acting as a stunt double for Sharon Stone in Catwoman. Here’s Furneaux, hunting feral goats with a bow and arrow. Here’s Furneaux, at an Adelaide private school, a sea of yellow and white gingham uniforms on manicured green lawns. Here’s Furneaux, practically sitting on her modem as we talk on WhatsApp, the signal from outback South Australia sketchy. Her only other option is to perch on the roof of her ute, she says, through the slightly awkward delay down the line. Because we’re both from Adelaide, we naturally chat about the school we went to – the same one, Pembroke. Until then Furneaux, now 48, had been at a local state school. “My parents were like, ‘we have got to get her into a private school. She’s never going to pass’,” she says. She was 19 and headed towards a career in business management or marketing when she broke her back in a car accident. After being bedridden and told she would have only limited mobility – which fortunately turned out not to be the case – she realised she wanted to travel, to be physically challenged and to be outside. Skip to Vancouver, where she started training with Kirk Jacques, whose website names Scarlett Johansson and Woody Harrelson among his previous clients. Jacques taught Furneaux “film fighting” – modified kickboxing, taekwondo and weaponry. Furneaux says it was more like “relearning, not learning” to fight. Initially she had no plans to pursue a career in the movies, but after “three really long, hard years of working my arse off”, an unexpected opportunity arose. “I just got lucky because Sharon Stone came to town and needed another five foot eight double who knew kickboxing. That was quite a fast track. I felt incredibly out of my depth.” She expected to start out with small bits – “you might just run out of the way of a car or something” – but soon she was in fight sequences with Halle Berry (Catwoman to Stone’s villainous Laurel Hedare). Furneaux spent about 16 years doubling for stars, including Jennifer Garner and Anne Hathaway. She won the Taurus World Stunt Award for her work on the set of Thor, doubling for Jaimie Alexander who played alongside Chris Hemsworth. After 16 years of bumps and bruises – and an incident where she tore her hamstring off the bone – Furneaux was starting to quieten down. But she was still doing bits and pieces of stuntwork in the United States when her sister called her. It was early 2020. “She said: ‘You need to decide today where you’re going to be for the next two years. If Australia is where you want to be you need to be on a flight tomorrow’,” Furneaux says. She chose to sit out the pandemic in Australia, and her partner Calem O’Grady joined her. Before long they were shooting a documentary at her cousin’s farm near Peterborough, about three hours north of Adelaide. That’s where she had first started hunting goats. “I was vegetarian … then I decided if I was going to eat meat, I wanted to do it in the most sustainable way possible, which is hunting your own meat,” she says. “And I really don’t like guns. So I picked up a bow and arrow and it just felt right.” I ask for her favourite goat recipe, and she defers to O’Grady’s talents. The former chef makes a mean goat curry. “He puts the bones in it as well, so you get all the marrow, and it’s really, it’s just delicious,” she says. Asked how her friends and family have reacted to her goat hunting past-time after her Catwoman-hunting past, she says: “I don’t think anyone’s surprised at anything I do any more. “I think I’m just wired a little bit differently. I said ‘yeah, I’m going to get into extreme survival now’.” Extreme survival, Furneaux points out, is not like being a doomsday prepper. It’s being able to survive off the land, to hunt your own food, to understand nature. The line starts to crackle and fade as Furneaux talks about upcoming projects. A book due out (“the first survival guide of its kind written by a female”), another television show. Surviving, extremely. I ask her what she’s afraid of. “Every time before I get up in front of a big crowd, I’m terrified,” she says, acknowledging it’s part of the gig to promote her work and as a motivational speaker.

3/12/2022,"It was an appropriately apocalyptic day for the preview of the 23rd Sydney biennale. The Colombian director José Roca has titled it rīvus, which means “stream”: a deep examination of all things watery, from the drowning of Pacific Islands to the loss of fishing cultures during the slow destruction of climate change. That Wednesday, as massive floods inundated eastern Australia, New South Wales authorities warned people to stay at home unless it was strictly necessary. The show went on. And it was a soggy triumph. Constant rain during the eight-hour, six-venue marathon only added to the urgency of the message. “Rivers, wetlands and other salt and freshwater ecosystems feature in the biennale … as dynamic living systems with varying degrees of political agency,” Roca has previously said. “Indigenous knowledges have long understood non-human entities as living ancestral beings with a right to life that must be protected. But only recently have animals, plants, mountains and bodies of water been granted legal personhood. If we can recognise them as individual beings, what might they say?” There are many beautiful, worrying and enlightening answers to this question in the show’s 330 artworks – by 89 participants – and 400 events involving individual artists and groups from all over the world. Rainwater washed down the high sandstone walls of the Cutaway at Barangaroo; vast installations were carefully protected from it. Sydney-based artist Clare Milledge made a beautiful, large-scale silk tent housing hanging copper cauldrons, coils of shipping and climbing rope, suspended glass paintings and more things germane to her topic. Her installation, titled Imbás: a well at the bottom of the sea, imagined Sinnan, the goddess of the River Shannon in Ireland, who is said to have journeyed to a deep spring seeking wisdom, and from it she released poetry into the world. The British-Finnish artist, composer and performer Hanna Tuulikki spoke about her new video, Seals’kin, which deals with mythical Norse selkies, who can transform from seals to humans, shedding their skin each time. In the myths, she said, humans would sometimes be abducted to the underwater kingdom orseals would become trapped on land after losing their skin. As Tuulikki studied the stories, she came to understand them as “mass bereavement allegories about loss and longing” in coastal communities. She will sing traditional shanties about them while she is here. Indigenous Australian artists also have much to say at the biennale. Trawlwoolway artist Julie Gough put together a video from kayak trips she took on the Macquarie River and adjoining waterways in Tasmania: it lies horizontal on the floor at the Curaway, with her kayak suspended and plastered with stickers of stones stolen and held in museums around the world – out of country. Once she received the biennale’s commission, Gough paddled without knowing her end goal, hoping the river would provide an answer. It was a risk, but at the end of the Mersey River, where it runs into the sea at Devonport, she found Native Rock. “The names gave me the clue,” she says. She researched the place and learned it was the site of a massacre. “The people of that region held a last stand at that rock,” she says. “There is no surviving family or any people from that region.” Barkandji artist Badger Bates is a tireless waterways activist. At the Art Gallery of NSW, his black and white linocuts, based on the geography of tributaries and lakes of the Barka (Darling River) and the teachings of his Granny Moysey, have been blown up to meander around several walls. This serves as a background to an installation of carved canoes – one by Bates – and sculptures that highlight the river fish being killed by local industries that produce chemical waste. At Barangaroo, The Great Animal Orchestra is a powerful audio-visual work of animal voices accompanied by bright electronic signals of their sounds. Here, sound is the focus, accompanied by something mesmerising to watch. “When people hear this kind of theme for life on earth and our relationship to that, they’re going to come away changed,” said Bernie Krause, a US musician and soundscape ecologist who worked with London-based collective United Visual Artists to make the artwork. There is a lot to see at six venues across the city. At the Museum of Contemporary Art, Slovenian artist and architect Marjetica Potrč presents a new work, The House of Agreement Between Humans and the Earth, a structure that examines the relationship between people and the natural world. This and her signature wall drawings tell the stories of two rivers: the Soča in Slovenia and the Galari (Lachlan River) on Wiradjuri country. And Chilean artist Paula de Solminihac has two wall hangings of printed ink and fine paper, across from scrawls of algebraic calculations. Roca, the biennale’s director, had intended to minimise his carbon footprint by moving to Sydney for the duration of the show’s preparation. Two years of travel restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic minimised it even further and prevented his wife, a lawyer, from working. The end result is a diverse collection of artworks and a powerful piece of advocacy for our planet.

3/12/2022,"A mother accused of murdering her five-year-old child was heard screaming: “What have you done with my son?” on the morning his body was discovered by police in a river, a jury has been told. Logan Mwangi, also known as Logan Williamson, was found in the River Ogmore close to his home in the village of Sarn, south Wales, having suffered 56 injuries to his face, head and body, Cardiff crown court has heard. His mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, his stepfather John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old boy, who cannot legally be identified, are on trial for his murder. Paula Heath, a witness, told the jury on Friday that she was staying with her partner nearby when she was woken at about 5am on the day Logan’s body was found – 31 July 2021 – by the sound of a man and woman “bickering”. She said she heard the woman yelling: “What have you done to my son? Where is my son? I want my son.” She claimed a male voice shouted in reply: “I have done nothing with your son.” Heath told the court the woman sounded “hysterical”, adding: “The only way you could describe it was sheer panic. She was shouting: ‘Logan, Logan,’ and: ‘The back door’s open, he’s got no shoes on, he’s got no socks on.’” Later, Heath said, she saw Williamson run towards a police officer in her nightdress and bare feet and shouted: “He’s my son. You’re telling me nothing.” The jury has been told Williamson’s behaviour, including making a 999 call to police to report Logan missing, was part of a plan concocted by the three defendants to cover up their role in his death. Williamson and the youth deny committing murder and perverting the course of justice. Cole denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice. Logan’s mother claims to have put her son to bed the night before his body was found and to have woken to find him missing. Williamson’s close friend Rhiannon Hales told the court Logan was “amazing”. She said: “He had the best little smile. He was always happy and smiling – a typical mummy’s boy. He loved his mum.” Hales told the jury that Williamson and Cole had a stricter parenting style than her but she said there was “nothing to suggest anything other than a strict parent”. She said the boy was “quieter” and “less playful” around Cole, whom he called his dad.

3/12/2022,"Sixteen days after Russia invaded Ukraine, life in the capital is far from ordinary. Kyiv is a city under siege. Half of its inhabitants have left. Russian tanks and armoured vehicles are edging ever closer from the north and west, with some units just nine miles away. There are sandbags and tank traps. And yet there were tentative signs on Friday that those who remained were seeking to return to a kind of normality, even as war raged around them. In a Facebook post, Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said it was time for the country’s economy to restart. Those displaced by Russian bombing should try to find jobs, he boldly suggested. Over in Observatorna Street in central Kyiv, a 15-minute walk from the landmark St Sophia’s Cathedral, a group of Kyiv hipsters were heeding the minister’s call. City hairdressers had staged a muted reopening. There were few customers for now. The street outside was mostly deserted. And you needed an appointment. “We only take people through word of mouth at the moment,” said Yulia Stets, the salon’s lead stylist and director. The business opened in October, soon after the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, began amassing troops on Ukraine’s borders. The salon slotted right into Kyiv’s burgeoning youth scene, so hip that it was widely referred to as the “new Berlin”. Stets said she returned to work two days ago. So far they had cut the hair of seven people. Most of the staff have exited Kyiv but there were so many hairdressers without work that Stets proposed the salon become a cooperative. “We’re not getting paid,” she said. “Our last salary is all we have. People have to find a way to start working again.” Air-raid sirens go off every few hours in Kyiv. The city centre has not been hit for more than a week, when two Russian bombs struck the TV tower, killing several civilians including a journalist. Residents have grown used to the warnings. Most carry on with their daily tasks. The war, however, is never far away. A colleague of Stets went home to Kharkiv, a city which Moscow has remorselessly pounded. The employee sent Stets pictures of three dead men who had been killed when they ventured out for water. Stets and her only remaining hairdresser, Taras Savchenko, have converted one of the salon’s rooms into a storage area. It is now being used as part of Kyiv’s – and Ukraine’s – ubiquitous volunteer effort. Restaurant owners have created a network of more than 100 kitchens. They are working in shifts to deliver food to hospitals, soldiers and to other key workers. Savchenko said he had thought about cutting hair for the first time on Thursday. Previously he had collected generators from farmers and delivered them to the frontline as a volunteer driver. “After the war I want to get military training. I have none at the moment,” he said. And what about Russia? Savchenko said he wanted to kill “orcs” – a Ukrainian term for invading Kremlin soldiers – but wasn’t yet in a position to do so. Before the war he was critical of Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Now he is a fan. “What he’s doing as commander in chief is totally correct.” Non-essential shops, bars and restaurants in Kyiv have shut, along with hotels and entertainment venues. The city’s Soviet-era underground network functions as a bomb shelter. There is a train every 90 minutes. Zhennya was sitting in a stationary train in Olimpiiska station, waiting to travel to his home in Teremky, in south Kyiv. He said he came into town to buy some groceries. Usually an employee in the agri business, he said he was not working. “I have been out every day since the war began to do shopping,” explained Zhennya, who is in his mid 50s. The Park Inn hotel – a looming glass tower – and the city’s Olympic stadium were both devoid of inhabitants. But a coffee stand next to the station had miraculously reopened. Ruslan, a barista, said he went back to work on Wednesday. On Friday he said he had served 50 people – a small sign that life was carrying on. Back at the salon, a doctor working in Kyiv’s hospital number 17 came in to deliver supplies. He also brought bad news: one of his patients included a pregnant woman fleeing from Irpin, north-west of Kyiv. A Russian shell had killed her husband and she had lost her baby, Yevhen said. Two other fashionable Kyivans turned volunteers also dropped by at the salon, to pick up dog food. They were taking it to a new dog shelter. It has so far received 49 dogs – and one wolf – all apparently abandoned by owners who had fled Kyiv for western Ukraine, Poland and other destinations. When the war started, the Ukrainian government told citizens to stay at home and not go to work. But after several days of lockdown, supermarkets, petrol stations and pharmacies were told they could reopen. Many did. Now other businesses are considering starting to operate in this traumatic new normal. In his latest video address on Friday, Zelenskiy said Ukraine and its capital had survived 16 days of Russian attack – longer than Moscow and many of the Ukraine’s western supporters had anticipated. He spoke of a “strategic turning point”. He even mentioned the word “victory”. This may be wishful thinking, but whether accurate or not, the owner of Kyiv’s most famous Crimean Tatar restaurant, Musafir, said he was considering reopening on Saturday. Kemal Seitveliyev had been volunteering along with staff members. He said society needed to start functioning again even in these abnormal conditions. Musafir used to have three branches in Kyiv, but Seitveliyev said they were only using one because, as with the hair salon, his employees had mostly departed. “A few people have called me to ask if we’re open. So there is some interest. But let’s see.” He acknowledged that a reopening may be short-lived, if and when the bombs resume. “If they take Kyiv, well, that’s the end,” he said.",News/World news,‘We’re not getting paid’: the Kyiv businesses trying to reopen,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/11/were-not-getting-paid-the-kyiv-businesses-trying-to-reopen
3/12/2022,"The Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention once proposed that no two nations with McDonald’s franchises would go to war; people in those kinds of economies would rather queue for burgers. The thesis was not only crass, but soon disproven. Yet it nodded to a broader truth: that economic ties were drawing countries closer together, creating a global interdependence which would not quickly be undone. Times have changed. On Tuesday, the American fast-food giant suspended its operations in Russia. It is part of a dramatic exodus by international brands – from Uniqlo, Netflix and Chanel to Apple, PwC and American Express – due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the western sanctions imposed in response and the public outcry. Shell and BP are selling their Russian assets. Britain and the US are banning Russian oil, while the EU is slowly phasing out gas imports, on which it is heavily dependent. On Friday, the US announced that, with allies, it was revoking Russia’s “most favoured nation” status. This huge and abrupt retrenchment is contributing to an existing economic shift of deglobalisation. The arrival of McDonald’s in Moscow in 1990 exemplified the incoming tide of global integration. Economic liberalisation in China, the Soviet Union’s collapse and the advent of new technologies created a world connected as never before – one in which it would soon seem mundane for a Russian oligarch to own an English football club; for a Chinese state firm to invest in a British nuclear plant; for American teens to dance to Korean pop on a Chinese-owned app; for identical products to be sold from Dubai to Durban and Bangkok to Buenos Aires. The economist Douglas Irwin argues that the financial crisis of 2008-09 marked the moment the process slowed, then reversed. The costs of globalisation, from the impact of shocks far away to the stunting of industrialisation in parts of Africa and low wage growth in developed nations, became increasingly evident and fostered populism. Donald Trump’s love of tariffs and trade war with China accelerated the protectionist trend. Beijing excluded US internet giants and increasingly looked towards domestic consumption and self-sufficiency in key technologies. The pandemic dramatically demonstrated the vulnerabilities in long supply chains, and made countries look closer to home. Narendra Modi announced a Self-reliant India scheme; Japan introduced incentives for companies to onshore production. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, declared that “this kind of globalisation was reaching the end of its cycle” anyway. The change should not be overstated. Most of the companies pulling out of Russia have said they are only pausing their business – though Moscow has now threatened to seize the assets of western firms exiting the country. It is doubtful that they would be so quick to quit China, where a much larger market is at stake: thousands, not hundreds, of McDonald’s branches. Concerns about human rights there are regularly brushed aside. Deglobalisation does not mean we will see a new age of autarky – the kind of drastic reversal seen in the 1920s and 30s, when protectionism surged and global trade collapsed. Even the emergence of discrete spheres of activity, cold war-style, would be a very big shift; China has boosted economic ties with Russia, but its trade with the EU and US is far greater. The pandemic demonstrated the need for international cooperation as well as national self-reliance – and if we are to tackle and adapt to global heating, technology transfer will be central. But the high tide of globalisation has passed for now; the question is how far the water will drop.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on deglobalisation: McDonald’s quits Moscow | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/11/the-guardian-view-on-deglobalisation-mcdonalds-quits-moscow
