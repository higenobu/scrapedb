2/6/2022,"Trump-era White House staffers frequently put documents in ""burn bags,"" per The Washington Post. Regular ""burn runs"" would see these bags taken to the Pentagon for incineration, The Post said. It was up to the staffers to decide which documents to preserve and which to destroy, the media outlet reported. It has been widely reported that former President Donald Trump had a penchant for tearing apart presidential documents, but new details have emerged about how his aides disposed of potentially important papers. According to The Washington Post, staffers frequently put documents into ""burn bags"" to be incinerated at the Pentagon. Burn bags resemble paper grocery bags and are widely available throughout the White House complex. Organizations dealing with top-secret information, like the CIA and NSA, often use them because destruction via burn bags is considered superior to shredding. There are two types of ""burn bags,"" one for classified and the other for unclassified material, but both are ultimately destroyed, per The Post. The media outlet reported that, in Trump's White House, there were regular ""burn runs"" in which the classified bags were transported to the Pentagon for incineration. A senior Trump White House official told The Post that he and other staffers regularly put documents into ""burn bags"" to be incinerated, and, he said, it was up to them which would be destroyed. Meanwhile, records personnel would attempt to manage the volume of torn documents being consigned to burn bags. They would tip the contents onto a table to puzzle out which documents needed to be taped back together and preserved, a former official told The Washington Post. Problems with record preservation in the Trump administration are well-documented. Insider reported that the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack received Trump-era White House documents that had been torn up and taped back together by staff assigned to jigsaw them back together. Historians raised concerns during his tenure that his presidential records would be poorly preserved or destroyed entirely â€“ potentially violating the Presidential Records Act. ""The biggest takeaway I have from that behavior is it reflects a conviction that he was above the law,"" said presidential historian Lindsay Chervinsky, told The Washington Post. ""He did not see himself bound by those things.""

2/6/2022,"(Reuters) - Authorities in Iceland have found a small plane at the bottom of a lake two days after the aircraft went missing with three tourists and a pilot on board, police said on Saturday. The three tourists on the Cessna 172N plane - who departed for a sightseeing tour on Thursday - were from Belgium, the Netherlands and the United States, Iceland's Morgunbladid newspaper reported. Iceland's coastguard said in a statement the plane crashed into Lake Thingvallavatn some 40 km (25 miles) east of the capital, Reykjavik, and was located with the help of an unmanned submarine. The plane has not been pulled to the surface and no bodies have yet been recovered. The Dutch Foreign Ministry told Reuters it had been informed by the airline company that a 27-year-old Dutch man living in Belgium was on the plane when it disappeared. Coastguard officials could not immediately confirm the nationalities of the two other missing passengers.

2/6/2022,"In fact, personal finance expert Suze Orman has laid out four specific situations when she believes it makes sense to rent instead of buy. Although Orman doesn't specifically mention it, there's also a risk you could end up walking away with less than you paid for the home if you're in the house for a short time and property values don't rise enough to cover your fees. You're also more likely to end up having to pay capital gains taxes if you own your home for less than two years, and would have to pay these taxes at a much higher rate if you owned the house for under a year -- although Orman doesn't specifically address this issue either.",Business/Motley Fool,Suze Orman Says You Should Rent Instead of Buy in These 4 Situations,https://news.yahoo.com/m/23b8f10c-41c9-3482-9cb3-20831617952d/suze-orman-says-you-should.html
