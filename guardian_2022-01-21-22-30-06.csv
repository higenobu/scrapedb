1/21/2022,"The reigning snowboard cross world champion, Charlotte Bankes, and Sochi 2014 freestyle skiing silver medallist, Gus Kenworthy, are the headline acts in a 21-strong squad of skiers and snowboarders who are aiming to help Team GB achieve their greatest Winter Olympics result next month. Bankes, who has been in sensational form this season, will be competing at her third Games – but her first for Britain. The 26-year-old was born in Hemel Hempstead before moving to the Alps as a four-year-old, was part of France’s team in 2014 and 2018 and is considered Britain’s best chance of a gold medal in Beijing.  Meanwhile Kenworthy, who represented the USA in 2014 and 2018, also has a shot if he can return to the form that made him an eight-time world champion. Several other of the GB Snowsport team, announced on Friday, also have genuine shots of making the podium – including Zoe Atkin, Kirsty Muir and James Woods in the freestyle skiing, and snowboarder Katie Omerod – as Team GB seek to beat their record of five medals at a Winter Olympics. Omerod’s selection is particularly noteworthy given the nightmare she endured in Pyeongchang four years ago where she split her heel in two while training before the Games. Her injury was so serious it took medics an hour to cut her boot off and her recovery involved seven operations and a year of rehab. “The fact that I’m even here now qualifying for another Olympic Games feels really amazing to me, because it has been a really difficult journey,” admitted Omerod. “At one point I just wanted to be able to walk again. But I’ve worked extremely hard over the last four years to be in this position now where I’m confidently going into my second Games.” “I definitely think we have a team capable of getting medals,” she added. “Especially Kirsty, James and Charlotte.” Nine ski and snowboard athletes have been selected for Team GB for the first time, while alpine skier, Dave Ryding, and nordic skiers Andrew Musgrave and Andrew Young are each set to appear in their fourth Olympic Winter Games. “It’s such a huge honour to be named as part of Team GB again, and I can’t wait to get out there and get racing,” said Ryding. “As athletes, we take all our competitions seriously, but there’s something undeniably special about representing the country at an Olympic Games. “This is a really exciting time for British skiing and snowboarding, and like the whole squad I’m looking forward to giving my all in Beijing.” That message was echoed by Team GB’s chef de mission Georgie Harland, who expects that 50 Team GB athletes in total will go to the Winter Olympics “It is great to see representation across more disciplines than we have taken to a Games before and an equally fantastic mix of both youth and experience as we welcome nine Olympic debutants to the team,” she added. “The squad has proved themselves to be extremely competitive on the world stage over the past few seasons and I look forward to seeing them perform on the Olympic stage in just a couple weeks’ time.”",Sport/Sport,Charlotte Bankes leads medal hopes of GB Winter Olympics snowsport squad,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/charlotte-bankes-leads-medal-hopes-of-gb-winter-olympics-snowsport-squad
1/21/2022,"When giant purple billboards advertising Muhammad Malik’s search to find a wife appeared in London and Birmingham in early January, the 29-year-old financial consultant became an overnight celebrity. His quest attracted widespread coverage and messages of support on social media, which Malik said led to 5,000 responses via an accompanying website, findMALIKawife.com.  Then last week, Muslim dating app Muzmatch revealed it was behind the stunt, with Malik’s website rebranded, directing hopeful suitors to their site. The revelation prompted mixed reactions on social media, with one user praising the viral marketing campaign, another criticising it as unethical and a third saying it was leaning into Islamophobic tropes as a result of its slogan “save me from an arranged marriage”. Malik, a startup consultant at Nationwide building society, said Muzmatch’s marketing team pitched the campaign to him last autumn. He has previously appeared in adverts and promotional videos for the app, including one called “Farts Break Hearts” where he discusses his dating red flags, which include “that there’s a double life going on”. He denied that the campaign is disingenuous: “This was an idea that was presented to me and I thought, it’s genuine, I’m 100% looking. But these guys just absolutely took it on steroids. I’ve always been a bit tongue in cheek. A bit quirky. I’ve done a bit of stand-up comedy. So I think it was quite in line with that.” Shahzad Younas, chief executive of Muzmatch, added: “Malik was very keen to stress that there’s nothing wrong with an arranged marriage. For a lot of people it works. The whole premise touches more upon how young Muslims are increasingly becoming empowered through Muzmatch to find their own partner, but still do it in a way that’s respectful of their faith, their traditions, their culture.” The viral campaign comes as Muzmatch, which has 5 million users worldwide, is defending itself from a claim of alleged trademark infringement brought by internet dating giant Match.com in the high court. Muzmatch was accused of “piggybacking on established dating brands” to improve its success. The court heard that Match brought the legal action after four failed attempts to buy Muzmatch. Hussein Kesvani, author of Follow Me, Akhi, which explores how British Muslims interact with the online world, compared Malik to TikTok trainspotter Francis Bourgeois, who was revealed to be a student called Luke Holland, represented by a modelling agency. He was subsequently signed up to feature in an ad campaign for Gucci and the North Face. “The aim is to get people really invested in a character that you’re not quite sure is ‘real’” said Kesvani. “Muzmatch might argue that ‘Malik’ is more a representation of the kind of clientele of the platform. Which, in this case, seems to be middle class, fashionable, metropolitan young Muslims for whom faith is a part of their identity and aesthetic. “To me, this represents what MuzMatch is trying to assert itself as, now that it finds itself being the most successful ‘halal dating’ app … It was always going to lead to some identity crisis as it expanded.” Malik, who lives in London with his parents, said he considered himself “more on the Orthodox, conservative side” of Islam. “When going on dates, it’s always a chaperone date. From a spiritual angle, the purity is intact in terms of there’s no ulterior motives. What you’re focused on marriage.” A member of Muzmatch’s marketing team is helping Malik sift through the thousands of responses. He added that he has personally responded to more than 100 so far. But he said, even if he did not find a wife among them, he was “super content as a singleton”. “I’d be really happy even in a decade if I were to be single, but I would be, maybe, even happier with somebody.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,How a Muslim dating app made UK man’s search for a wife go viral,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/21/how-a-muslim-dating-app-made-uk-mans-search-for-a-wife-go-viral
1/21/2022,"Italian parliamentarians who have Covid-19 may be allowed to cast their ballots for Italy’s new president from a car park. More than 1,000 MPs and regional delegates will begin voting on Monday, and amid a debacle over who the next head of state should be, the coronavirus pandemic is posing logistical challenges.  About 35 of the so-called “grand electors” are in quarantine with Covid-19, and to ensure a fair election and that quorum requirements are met, Roberto Fico, the lower house speaker, has suggested allowing them to vote in the car park of Montecitorio palace, the seat of the chamber of deputies. The proposal will be discussed on Friday and will go ahead if the government grants the voters a permit to leave their homes. It is unclear how the “drive-in” vote will work, but according to reports in the Italian press, electors could either cast their votes from a booth set up in the car park, or from their car. Either way, they will not be there to “watch a film, order something to eat or take a Covid test,” Niccolò Carratelli wrote in La Stampa. “We’ve never seen a drive-in polling station before.” Meanwhile, Guido De Martini, a lawmaker in the far-right League party and rebel against Italy’s vaccine mandate, said he felt like “a panda heading for extinction” as he would not be able to travel to Rome from his home in Sardinia without the “super green pass” needed to prove double vaccination. “I can’t get on a plane or ferry without the super green pass,” De Martini told La Stampa. “I thought about booking a private plane, but it costs too much. My battle is one of principle, of liberty … I am not against vaccines, I am against obligatory vaccines.” He added that if there were a smaller stretch of sea between Sardinia and the mainland, he might have considered swimming. “I love running and cycling, but especially swimming in the sea. But the crossing from Sardinia would be too tough.”",News/World news,Quarantined Italian MPs gear up for drive-in vote for new president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/21/quarantined-italian-mps-gear-up-for-drive-in-vote-for-new-president
1/21/2022,"Generous Guardian and Observer readers have raised more than £1m for four charities that are fighting for climate justice and working with communities severely affected by climate-induced extreme weather events. A late surge in donations, coupled with a four-day extension helped push the 2021 charity appeal to £1,005,000 before it closed on Thursday night. It is the seventh year in a row that the appeal has raised more than £1m for charity.  Just over 9,500 people gave to the appeal. Donations will be shared between four charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation. The theme this year was climate justice, inspired by stories of people and communities uprooted by climate volatility, whether flooding, wildfire, melting ice or drought, from Madagascar to the Arctic Circle. Thousands of donors emailed to tell us why they had given money to the appeal. Many said climate change was the most urgent issue affecting the planet, with many making the point that the people worst affected by climate crisis, in the world’s poorest countries, had done least to cause it. Each of the appeal’s four partner charities work primarily in developing countries in the global south. “We all have responsibility for the future of our Earth and a further responsibility to support those communities most affected by extreme weather events,” one donor wrote this week. Practical Action’s chief executive, Sarah Roberts, said: “On behalf of all of the communities we work with, I’d like to say a huge thank you to Guardian and the Observer readers. Their generosity will help us enable people on the frontline of climate change get the tools and knowledge they need to take back control of their lives.” Eva Rehse, the chief executive of Global Greengrants Fund UK, said: “Thanks to the readers of the Guardian and Observer for your incredible generosity and solidarity. Your donations are acts of climate justice, and give us hope for a better future.” Steve Trent, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Foundation, said: “The overwhelming generosity of the readers of the Guardian and Observer has meant we are going into 2022 ready to continue our fight for climate justice.” Richard Deverell, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said: “We can’t thank the supporters of the Guardian and Observer appeal enough. The incredibly generous sum of money raised will make a big difference to the lives of people we work with in Madagascar. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your generosity for seeking justice for the victims of climate change and helping us find solutions in nature.”",News/Society,Guardian and Observer climate justice charity appeal tops £1m,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/21/guardian-and-observer-climate-justice-charity-appeal
1/21/2022,"Black tights are fashion Marmite. If you love them, you look forward to the first brisk September or October day when it is acceptable to stop pretending that “late summer” exists on these shores and layer a thick pair of tights under your dress. You have strong views on optimum denier count and can debate the relative merits of Falke and Wolford at length. You could happily give a Ted talk on the whether the Edie Sedgwick modern jazz vibe of a matte pair is more chic than the lustre of a velvet or satin finish.The other camp – my camp – would sooner brave horizontal snow and sleet bare-legged than be seen dead in a pair. In fashion, not wearing tights has long been a badge of honour. Around the time that tottering around in high heels all day stopped signalling elegance and began to make you look a bit deranged, going bare-legged took over as the style set’s equivalent of a club tie. Going bare-legged through winter requires a high tolerance for windchill and, depending on your skin colour, a time-consuming fake-tan habit. Still, the bare-legged brigade eschew tights because we think it looks better.  I suppose this is all an elaborate justification for the fact that I stopped wearing tights because no one else on the front row was wearing them and they felt kind of scruffy. Going bare-legged made me feel like a contender. Style is a way of insisting on something, as Susan Sontag said, and black tights felt like giving up, like throwing in the towel.In the noughties, when Prada was all about a knee-length skirt, and through the 2010s, when the midi skirt ruled, going bare-legged didn’t mean being cold. I could wear ankle boots with socks, a long-ish skirt and a coat, and I was technically bare-legged but only a tiny bit of flesh was exposed. But now the mini is back. Not just in the theoretical, fashion-week sense, but in real life. Skirts and dresses are shorter – on magazine covers and in shop windows but also on the street, on the bus, in the park. And going without tights while wearing a skirt that ends above the knee calls for a double dose of bravery, not only in the face of cold but in feeling exposed and naked. Which is why, while hemlines have been creeping upwards, tights have been making a comeback. “’Tis the season to start wearing hosiery again” ran an American Vogue headline in September, a declaration that would surely not have had a green light from editor and bare-leg warrior queen Anna Wintour before this year.The black tights renaissance began with polka-dotted sheers, or tights plastered with graphic logos – fancy, fashion-forward hosiery being a way for opaque-sceptics like me to start wearing tights again without losing face. Amina Muaddi – Rihanna’s favourite shoe designer, and 100% the kind of hardcore fashionista who wouldn’t have been seen dead in tights until recently – has designed a range for Wolford that includes a pair with one black lace leg and one plain sheer leg, and stirrup-footed dance tights in high-shine latex.But the crystal dots and the fishnets are just the gateway drug to the hard stuff that is luring us all back in: the true black opaque tight. Bare-leg bravado has been left behind in the olden days, along with spur-of-the-moment city breaks and mask-incompatible lipgloss. Reader, I’m back in my tights.

1/21/2022,"Debates on the future of the broadcaster that hits its 100th birthday this year always become Hamlet-like: BBC or not BBC? With centenary celebrations muted this week by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, freezing the licence fee for two years and threatening to axe it completely by the next BBC royal charter in 2028, the familiar standoff resumes between those who argue for no state-dominant broadcaster (Conservative politicians and media) and those who advocate no change (broadcasting unions, liberal columnists). Realistically, though, the BBC’s future lies in a third way the Prince of Denmark didn’t have – being very different. Trying to “save the licence fee” or “leave the BBC alone” (though understandable slogans, given its long and vast contribution to national culture and education) is like aiming for immortality; regardless of strategy, time will beat you. Licence fee purchases have fallen by around a million in the last year. With Dorries effectively promising to end prosecution of non-payers, this trend will only accelerate, and digital consumption makes compliance harder to police.  So before a new structure is settled, the BBC must resolve: what is public broadcasting now? How much and by what method can the public reasonably be asked to pay? How does a four-nation British broadcaster survive in a splintering kingdom? (The percentage of licence fee evasion is higher in Scotland and Northern Ireland than England and Wales.) These questions are tough, and many answers are unpleasant. The BBC and its supporters took comfort from the clear retreat between Dorries’s Sunday tweet that “this licence fee announcement will be the last” and her vaguer mutterings in the House of Commons on Monday about consulting on future alternatives, and the present funding being a “dinosaur.” Some hope this softening reflected a rethink after substantial backlash to the threat, but the reason is probably bleaker. Understandably, few people have read section 57, sub-section 5 of the current BBC royal charter but, while it gives the culture secretary the power, from 2022, to fix the licence fee for the next five years (as Dorries has), and to launch a mid-term review (ditto), it also contains a warning. It states that the halfway investigation “must not consider: a) the Mission of the BBC; b) the Public Purposes of the BBC; or c) the licence fee funding model of the BBC for the period of this Charter.” Did Dorries jump the gun? Could BBC lawyers protest that, in declaring there will be no licence fee after 2028, she pre-empted both the mid-term review and the charter renewal process beginning in 2026? This is the end of the good news. By the next charter, Johnson will be spending more time with his families and Dorries writing her Merseyside erotic historical novels. But the BBC crisis will continue for future governments, whether Tory or Labour – and the latter would likely depend for support on seats held by the Scottish National Party, which, true to its name, aims to replace the British Broadcasting Corporation with a national broadcaster as devolved as the country’s politics. Since Dorries’s announcements, the case for leaving the BBC alone has focused, as it tends to, on Sir David Attenborough, Line of Duty and BBC News. Yet each of those totems is wobbly. Although the embodiment of the BBC, Attenborough, in recent years, has moonlighted at Sky and Netflix, drawn by 3D technology and global reach. And if 2027 does prove to be the last year of the licence fee, let’s hope some of it will be spent on another series by the then 101-year-old Sir David, though alternative justifications for the BBC’s existence may well be needed. As for Line of Duty, Jed Mercurio’s police procedural smash is aired by the BBC but made by an independent company, World Productions. Of the top 10 shows most streamed on iPlayer in 2021, only Silent Witness and Doctor Who were actually made by the BBC, and the Time Lord franchise is about to become a co-production with an indie, Bad Wolf. Of the most-watched shows on UK terrestrial TV last year, only Strictly Come Dancing is an in-house BBC show, and others – Euro 2020 football, Johnson’s lockdown addresses – were shared with rival broadcasters. Emblematically, BBC One’s brilliant recent drama Four Lives was made by ITV Studios. And Mercurio has produced ITV’s next big drama, Trigger Point, which starts on Sunday. So branding – the BBC’s historic strength – is blurred. With the network now producing progressively less of its output, its huge workforce of 22,219 is increasingly hard to justify. Not owning intellectual property rights also makes it trickier to swell commercial income through replay sales. Another key part of the BBC’s pitch for massive mandatory cash has always been that it offers unimpeachably trustworthy journalism – a quality much trumpeted amid a British prime minister and recent US president who have spectacularly ramped up political mendacity. Even this virtue, though, is not unequivocal. The original theory of the licence fee was that governments would collect the money then hand it over to be spent by a BBC guaranteed editorial “independence”. In reality, governments of all stripes use the menace of the next settlement to punish perceived editorial insolence or encourage positive coverage. The unusually frequent elections (three since 2015), divisive referendums on national shape and then the pandemic have perilously stress-tested BBC “impartiality”. Its newsrooms’ traditional approach – Chalk says this, but Cheese says that – was unlikely to feel 50-50 to either side of a 52-48 vote (at that point) to leave Europe. Is Boris Johnson honest? Donald Trump fascist? Joe Biden senile? Do lockdowns work? Such stories can’t be covered with 2 mins 45 secs each from left and right. It is true that Tory MPs and media regularly attack the BBC for “bias”, but ITN, Sky and Channel 4 are routinely more critical of Conservative administrations: ITN published the “party invite” email that most destabilised Johnson, Sky’s Beth Rigby interviewed him on Tuesday in a (justifiably) scathing way that would trigger emergency management meetings if Laura Kuenssberg did it. Politicians get angriest with the BBC because it feels like being bitten by a dog they think they own. Part of the solution might be to break that chain. Another weekend phone-blurt from Dorries’s allies declared “the days of state-run TV are over in Britain.” The language was revealingly misleading: the BBC is not supposed to be run by the state but owned by it, as is Channel 4 (which surely seems doomed to privatisation by that comment). As even Dorries probably isn’t suggesting that there will not be another royal charter – with the BBC an entirely private commercial entity – what might a post-2027 BBC look like? One option is the introduction of a “standard BBC” package, either funded by a cheaper voluntary licence fee or from direct taxation, with top-up options – broadly on the Sky/Amazon subscription model – of movies, sport, comedy, whatever. What would be available to each level of viewer, though, is hugely complex. Content that relatively few would pay for – local news, pre-school and school education (a boon to many parents during lockdown), religious worship, Radio 3 speech and music – would have to be balanced with high-rating treats – Call the Midwife, The Repair Shop, In the Night Garden – to encourage purchase. The question of whether EastEnders, Strictly Come Dancing or Countryfile should be cheaply available (to draw subscription traffic) or sold dearly (to maximise income) would take weeks of meetings. Intriguingly, radio, generally seen by BBC director generals as the inferior medium, may prove to be TV’s saviour, at least in the medium term. Screen use – increasingly likely to be done on mobile devices and through catchup rather than live – adapts easily to a Sky/Netflix model. But listening still flourishes on home or car radios and with allegiance to linear channels, and so is much harder to place behind a paywall – an argument for the licence fee (or a radio-specific one) to continue for some time. Whether any new funding model will support Gary Lineker’s £1.36m for introducing football, or the Radio 4 Today programme dispensing £1.3m between its presenters (some also do some other shows) is questionable. Could subscription cover the 113 BBC managers who earned more than £150,000 last year, or support a BBC website that employs more writers than many of the newspapers this multimillion-pound freesheet undermines? Such are the tough discussions to be had en route to the new BBC. It may help that cuts can hold hidden complexities. Reformers often fall into the trap of wanting to keep the BBC Proms while not having so many musicians (five orchestras, a band, a choir) on payroll, but there is symbiosis, and even cost effectiveness, in keeping both. And which politicians would want the legacy of vandalising that cultural heritage? The BBC situation feels existential, but it need not be fatal. The Corporation can emerge strongly creative and freer from government interference.

1/21/2022,"Across just five years of recorded output, south London outsider-composer Klein has journeyed from oblique, downer electronica redolent of Burial to a unique and singular warping of classical tropes. Befitting an artist who has released music on both cutting-edge dance labels and legacy European classical imprints, ahead of a milestone show at London’s Barbican next week Klein is performing at a club space in a Salford industrial estate. The first sounds you hear – under pulverising strobe lights – is the clattering club rhythms of Klein’s work performed by a lone percussionist hitting a large kick drum at the side of the stage. Reflecting Klein’s direction of travel, sounds that were once sampled are now far more likely to be organic; last year’s critically acclaimed album Harmattan had been composed for orchestra before the pandemic intervened.  Suspended from the ceiling, a single microphone swings across the dark stage, and when Klein uses it to capture her trumpet playing, thick swathes of echo and digital treatment render it startling in its grandeur and scale. If her recent wordless and beatless music toys with the conventions of classical music, then that’s the only thing conventional about tonight. In one of the hour set’s initially stranger moments, a performer introduced as Josie – and friend of Klein – is telling a rambling, surreal joke about a snail appearing on Pimp My Ride. It’s bewildering, before the joke’s awkward payoff is suddenly looped and transformed by Klein – one of the set’s serious highlights as the strange joke echoes, now unrecognisable, around the club for minutes. “How about them jokes!” grins the composer, dressed in an oversized T-shirt and thick knotted tie. Though Klein has rejected the tag of sound collagist, she has an evocative way with fragments, deploying them in sudden changes that can make you feel like you’ve fallen down a trap door. Stretches of celestial ambient or found speech collapse unexpectedly into beer-rattling drone. Klein grabs the swinging mic and begins MCing, which itself dissolves into some of Harmattan’s most straightforwardly pretty textures. It’s abstract but compelling; expectations remain a plaything for one of the UK’s most iconoclastic auteurs of sound.

1/21/2022,"Scotland’s first black professor has accused fellow academics of discrimination after an explosive row over Edinburgh’s links with slavery prompted calls for him to quit as chair of two groups reexamining the city’s history. The row began when Sir Geoff Palmer – who is leading two separate reviews into the city and the university’s involvement in the slave trade – denounced Jonathan Hearn and Sir Tom Devine, current and emeritus professors at Edinburgh University, as members of “an academic racist gang” after Hearn published an article in the Spectator suggesting the city council review risked being “historically superficial” and Devine stepped in to defend him.  Palmer criticised Hearn and Divine in a series of tweets, which focused particularly on their views of Sir Henry Dundas, a controversial figure whose monument in the Scottish capital was vandalised in June 2020 during a Black Lives Matter demonstration. Palmer and others believe Dundas, the leading Whig politician of Scotland in the late 18th century, has been unfairly credited with fighting slavery in Scotland when he held back abolition for a generation by delaying tactics in parliament, and a revised plaque explaining this background was erected at the monument last year. But in his recent article, Hearn argued that historians were still debating whether Dundas delayed abolition and that there was “plenty of evidence to suggest that Dundas’s gradualist approach to abolition – however unsatisfactory it may seem to us in the present day – was the only approach which would be politically successful at the time”. After Palmer’s outburst, Devine called for his dismissal from the review groups, accusing him of “appalling slurs of racism against those whose only fault was to have a different view from his own”. Palmertold the Guardian: “I have been making the same arguments for a long time, but I think this timing has to do with this project, the fact that this work is gaining significance but some historians are unhappy that they are not involved. “This is a public debate and if some people are demanding my dismissal without providing any evidence for it then that is discrimination. If they can provide evidence that I am incompetent and biased then I will step down.” Devine is understood to be taking legal advice, but another prominent academic figure in the city, the UK’s first professor of black male studies Tommy J Curry, said the row exemplified a naivety in Scottish culture around discussions about race. Hearn said that while he stood by his Spectator article, he had “no ill will” towards Palmer and would be “happy to engage in civil, face-to-face public discussions about our disagreements … My main concern in this is that inquiries into public history need to be conducted in an open manner, with respect for diverse viewpoints.” As the public consultation on the city review comes to an end this week, the council leader Adam McVey revealed it had generated thousands of “blatantly racist” responses from supporters of rightwing organisations looking to interfere with the process, saying: “The personal targeting of Geoff that I’ve seen is appalling. I’ve seen groups that are nothing to do with Edinburgh throwing abuse and scaremongering about a process they clearly know nothing about.” He added that the review group, led by Palmer, would now digest the thousands of responses to the consultation in a “considered and mature response”, with the aim “to more honestly tell our city’s history”. Curry, also a professor at Edinburgh University, said the response to Palmer revealed “a naivety of Scottish culture that it wants to have the debate but is not used to having arguments about race where black people themselves have the power to name racism in society. “This isn’t a difference of opinion, it’s about whether history should change based on fact. We’ve acknowledged that Dundas didn’t abolish slavery and did participate in the trade.” Reassessments such as this one have been going on for decades, said Curry, “but there is also a well-established pattern of UK scholars with no knowledge of black or brown scholars’ work in a global context, so everything reads as a political threat, with their only lens of understanding being woke culture of BLM”.",News/UK news,Scotland’s first black professor accuses Edinburgh academics of racism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/scotlands-first-black-professor-accuses-edinburgh-academics-of-racism
1/21/2022,"There is a mean-spirited and cynical argument that Michael Lee Aday owed his career to someone else’s talent: the late songwriter Jim Steinman, who wrote everything on Meat Loaf’s 43m-selling breakthrough album Bat Out of Hell, rescued his career when it was in the doldrums by agreeing to make 1993’s Bat Out of Hell II: Back Into Hell and was behind virtually every song for which Meat Loaf will be remembered. Of the 18 tracks on The Very Best of Meat Loaf, only four were not written by Steinman.  It’s certainly true that Meat Loaf found things much tougher without Steinman on board. Steinman had hits with other people – the Sisters of Mercy and Celine Dion among them – but not one of the Steinman-less albums Meat Loaf released in the 80s was a hit in the US. European fans remained a little more loyal and he occasionally scored a UK hit, most notably the distinctly Steinman-esque Modern Girl in 1984. But he spent most of the decade relentlessly touring in order to stave off bankruptcy, and the leap in sales between his 1986 album Blind Before I Stop – which had its greatest success in Switzerland, reaching No 22 – and Bat Out of Hell II, a global number one that sold 14m copies, tells its own story. Later in his career, when he and Steinman were on the outs – their famously fractious relationship at one point saw Meat Loaf attempting to sue the songwriter for $500m – Meat Loaf would simply cobble together albums using songs Steinman had written for other people and projects. He could assemble an all-star supporting cast, as he did on 2010’s Hang Cool Teddy Bear – which featured credits for Jon Bon Jovi, Brian May, Jack Black and Hugh Laurie among others – but the difference between a flop Meat Loaf album and a successful one seemed to be whether or not its cover bore the subtitle “Songs by Jim Steinman”. Nevertheless, their partnership was far from one-way traffic. Steinman’s songs were nothing if not unique: wilfully preposterous exercises in more-is-more campy grandiloquence, influenced in equal part by the teenage melodramas of 60s girl groups, Bruce Springsteen at his most chest-beating and – as Steinman never tired of pointing out – Richard Wagner. They were so over the top that it took a very particular kind of vocalist to perform them: “Obviously playing a role, but obviously genuine,” as Steinman put it – a tough trick to pull off. Certainly Steinman himself couldn’t do it, as evidenced by his only solo album, Bad for Good. Nor could many others: Steinman tried to put together bands to perform his material, but there were few takers for Pandora’s Box or The Dream Engine. Meat Loaf, though, could apparently do it with ease. He had a background in musical theatre and comedy, and a powerhouse voice that worked with histrionic hard rock; before Bat Out of Hell, he had sung lead vocals on a Ted Nugent album. It was a cocktail that gave him the peculiar ability to sing the most absurd Steinman lyrics with absolute commitment and sincerity, while the contrast between his exaggerated stage persona – eyes bulging, red handkerchief clutched in his fist – and the everyman he appeared to be off stage let you know he was in on the joke. That fitted Steinman to a tee. Whatever ridiculous extremes his music went to, there was something realistic and relatable about the emotions at the centre of his songs: millions of people didn’t go out and buy Bat Out of Hell in order to snigger at it; they bought it because the saga of the teenage romancers turned warring couple on Paradise By the Dashboard Light or All Revved Up With No Place to Go’s depiction of adolescent self-aggrandising and yearning for escape rang true. You could believe it even when what you were listening to beggared belief, and that was down to Meat Loaf. With the greatest respect to Bonnie Tyler – whose versions of Total Eclipse of the Heart and Holding Out for a Hero are masterpieces of take-no-prisoners emoting – and indeed Cher, whose bravura performance on Dead Ringer for Love is a thing of wonder, absolutely no one could sell a Steinman song the way Meat Loaf did. The simple truth is that no one was interested in Bat Out of Hell until they saw Meat Loaf performing its songs. Its first success came in Australia and the UK when a live video of the title track was shown on TV. The record label that released it, Epic, hated the album – it had been signed by one of their minor subsidiary labels, Cleveland International – and declined to promote it properly until someone came up with the idea of getting Meat Loaf to perform live at the label’s sales convention; steady touring and an appearance on Saturday Night Live saw to the rest. When Meat Loaf and band actually turned up to play on BBC2’s Old Grey Whistle Test in 1978, their appearance caused a sensation. And why wouldn’t it? Look at the footage of them performing Paradise By the Dashboard Light. His voice is already showing signs of the touring-induced wear that would scupper Bat Out Of Hell’s follow-up, but it hardly matters. Meat Loaf is in all his ruff-shirted, pop-eyed, finger-pointing, handkerchief-flapping majesty, while his duet partner Karla DeVito hams it up for all she’s worth, alternately looking bored rigid, furious or contemptuous. They spend the section of the song where a baseball announcer details the progress of a backseat fumble pretending to get off with each other. While DeVito rages at him about marriage, Meat Loaf stares down the camera with an expression that reads “can you believe this crap?” At another juncture, he creeps up behind her, wielding the microphone stand as if he’s about to smash her over the head with it. The song ends with Meat Loaf doubled over, repeatedly screaming “I can’t take it any more!” while DeVito rests her foot on his back and raises her arms in triumph. It still looks completely deranged 44 years on. Now imagine it appearing alongside the rest of the stuff Whistle Test dished up that year: Dean Friedman, 10CC, Dire Straits, Billy Joel, Jefferson Starship. You might have got the odd new wave band in there but really, what price the Vibrators after something this arresting and berserk? It’s hard to think of anyone else who could have pulled off such a performance, who could have done something so simultaneously absurd and thrilling: proof of Meat Loaf and Steinman’s perfectly matched partnership. It’s difficult to work out what Meat Loaf’s career would have been like had he not met Steinman, but it’s equally difficult to imagine what would have happened to Steinman had he not met Meat Loaf. “We belonged heart and soul to each other – we didn’t know each other, we were each other,” Meat Loaf said after Steinman’s death last year. “I don’t want to die, but I may die this year because of Jim.” He was 20 days out.
