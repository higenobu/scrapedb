3/16/2022,"Fox News said on Tuesday its cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski was killed in the same attack in Ukraine in which a correspondent, Benjamin Hall, was injured. According to the Ukraine news website kp.ua, a Ukrainian journalist, Oleksandra Kuvshinova, was also killed in the attack. The news follows the death in Ukraine on Sunday of Brent Renaud, an American film-maker. Fox News announced the attack and Hall’s injury on Monday, saying the reporter “was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine”. Zakrzewski and Kuvshinova died “as a result of artillery shelling by Russian troops in the north-eastern part of the village of Gorenka”, kp.ua said, without detailing the relationship between the journalists. In a tweet on Tuesday, the Fox News anchor John Roberts said it was “horrible news to report”. “I worked with Pierre many times around the world,” Roberts said. “He was an absolute treasure. Sending our most heartfelt prayers to Pierre’s wife and family.” Fox News’ chief executive, Suzanne Scott, said: “Pierre was killed in Horenka, outside of Kyiv, Ukraine. Pierre was with Benjamin Hall yesterday … when their vehicle was struck by incoming fire. “Pierre was a war zone photographer who covered nearly every international story for Fox News from Iraq to Afghanistan to Syria during his long tenure with us. “His passion and talent as a journalist were unmatched. Based in London, Pierre had been working in Ukraine since February. His talents were fast and there wasn’t a role that he didn’t jump in to help with in the field – from photographer to engineer to editor to producer – and he did it all under immense pressure with tremendous skill.” Zakrzewski, 55, helped Afghans who had worked for Fox News escape the country last summer after the US withdrawal, Scott added. “He played a key role in getting our Afghan freelance associates and their families out. In December, at our annual employee spotlight awards, Pierre was given the Unsung Hero award in recognition of his invaluable work.” I don’t know what to say. Pierre was as good as they come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I’m so sorry this happened to you. pic.twitter.com/IvxlPWGDAl Trey Yingst, a Fox News foreign correspondent, tweeted a picture with Zakrzewski and said: “I don’t know what to say. Pierre was as good as the come. Selfless. Brave. Passionate. I’m so sorry this happened to you.” Another Fox News anchor, Bill Hemmer, paid tribute to his colleague on air, saying Zakrzewski “was an absolute legend at this network. And his loss is devastating.” Hall, who is British-American, remained in hospital on Tuesday. The network said it was still trying to gather details of the attack on its team. “We have a minimal level of details right now,” Scott said in a memo to staff Monday that did not mention Zakrzewski. “Ben is hospitalised and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds. “The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding regions is our top priority and of the utmost importance. This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from the war zone.” On Sunday, Ukrainian authorities said Renaud, an award-winning filmmaker, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, outside Kyiv. An American photographer, Juan Arredondo, was wounded. Jane Ferguson, a reporter for PBS Newshour who was nearby, said: “Outraged Ukrainian police officer: ‘Tell America, tell the world, what they did to a journalist.’” Clifford Levy, a deputy managing editor of the New York Times, said the paper was “deeply saddened” to learn of Renaud’s death but he had not been on Times assignment when killed, despite wearing identification which named the paper. Levy added: “Brave journalists like Brent take tremendous risks to bear witness and to tell the world about the devastation and suffering caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.”",News/Media,Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski killed in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/15/fox-news-cameraman-killed-ukraine-pierre-zakrzewski
3/16/2022,"The Clarence House Chase at Ascot was the race of the season so far and the rematch between Shishkin and Energumene before a packed house at Cheltenham on Wednesday promises to be better yet. Shishkin will be the punters’ favourite after that one-length success at Ascot, while Willie Mullins, who trains both Chacun Pour Soi and Energumene, insists the former is the better horse. He does not seem keen to show his best form abroad, however, while Shishkin is always likely to put in the occasional sloppy jump. Energumene (3.30), though, was almost foot-perfect at Ascot, and travelled supremely well throughout. At around 4-1, he is the value bet to find the length he needs to upset the odds-on favourite. 1.30: Sir Gerhard is very short in the betting given that his hurdling was hardly foot-perfect at Leopardstown last time, but he got the job done readily enough in the end and should find it all a little less frantic over this trip. Stage Star, the Challow Hurdle winner, may be the biggest danger. 2.10: L’Homme Presse and Bravemansgame arrive with near-identical profiles: unbeaten in four races over fences including a Grade One, L’Homme Presse also has course form in the Dipper on New Year’s Day, but Bravemansgame is proven at this trip and that just tips the balance in his favour in what is likely to be a well-run race. 2.50: As competitive as it gets, even at the Festival, but Drop The Anchor hinted at a return to form last time, finished a close seventh in the County last year and has crept in on a 3lb lower mark this time around. 4.10: Tiger Roll was a long way short of his best at Navan last time, but he was last of six, beaten nearly 65 lengths, less than a month before running away with this 12 months ago and this has been his only real target for months. One of the all-time Festival greats can hopefully sign off with his sixth win at the meeting. 4.50: A fierce gallop is guaranteed with at least six regular front-runners in the field, but Before Midnight can sit just behind the pace too, and his win over track and trip on drying ground in October gives him a solid chance at around 14-1. 5.30: By definition, there is always a huge amount of unrevealed potential in the Bumper, which may be one reason why just two favourites have obliged in the last 16 years. American Mike has a near-identical profile to market leader Facile Vega, with two wide-margin wins on the bit, and makes plenty of appeal at around 9-4 to turn him over.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Energumene can avenge Shishkin loss at Cheltenham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/15/talking-horses-energumene-can-avenge-shishkin-loss-at-cheltenham
3/16/2022,"When Catherine Cohen’s The Twist …? She’s Gorgeous played the Edinburgh fringe in 2019, I fell hard for its charisma and swagger, its wickedly funny songs laying bare the troubled soul of an Insta-addled, personality-is-performance millennial. Belatedly, the show now makes it to Netflix, to answer the question: does the comedy of rapturous self-absorption still fly on the other side of a global pandemic? Happily, it does, Cohen easily assimilating Covid into the story of her own, endlessly fascinating self. If watching on TV can’t rival up-close-and-personal contact with the New Yorker’s starburst personality, this is still a cracking watch. Accompanied by Henry Koperski on piano, Cohen greedily hogs the stage and the attention (“Look at me doing comedy in a rhinestone romper!”) with this suite of songs and standup on the workings of her fabulous, fraught life and mind. And your attention is richly rewarded by an act whose every aside, gesture and turn of phrase (“which I absolutely – foot-pop! – j’adore”) intensifies the spectacle of neurotic self-regard. There are occasional sidesteps: a routine about visiting a Chipotle makes the staff’s sexism, rather than Cohen’s solipsism, the butt of the joke. But usually – as with the song about other people’s fitness regimes that’s soon narrating a disastrous one-night stand of her own – the joke switchback-returns to Cohen and the curated car-crash she’s making of her life. But what a rich joke that is, characterised by real complexity – as with a bleak-comic closing number drilling down into the contradictions of her romantic/erotic imagination, or with the song about plus-size clothing, which prompts the for-the-ages line “if I fuck this skinny guy I won’t have a chubby daughter that I have to fight with in the dressing room”. I’ll be intrigued to see – as with her contemporary Bo Burnham – whether this level of recursive self-involvement sustains far into Cohen’s 30s (she’s now 31). Either way, given her flair for tart social observation, her ruthless candour, and a voice that works double-time as a comic and a musical instrument (all those choruses that collapse into nonsense), I’ll absolutely be tuning in to find out.

3/16/2022,"Five mountain bongos have been released into a sanctuary in Kenya, a milestone in the fight for the animals’ survival with fewer than 100 left in the wild Considered critically endangered, the chestnut-coloured mountain bongo is one of the largest forest antelopes and native to the equatorial forests of Mount Kenya, Eburu, Mau and Aberdares. IUCN predicts their numbers will probably continue to decline without direct action. A recent wildlife census in Kenya counted just 96 mountain bongos in the wild. Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy (MKWC) and Kenya Wildlife Service and Kenya Forest Service have been leading a breeding and rewilding programme for the last 20 years. Eighteen mountain bongos (four male and 14 female) were repatriated from 14 zoos across the US to MKWC in Nanyuki, near Mount Kenya. The five animals released on Wednesday into the 314-hectare (776-acre) Mawingu mountain bongo sanctuary are descendants of the US herd. The subspecies once roamed in large numbers but has suffered unprecedented population decline since the 1950s due to poaching, the wildlife trade, predation and disease, in particular, a rinderpest outbreak in the 1980s. Dr Robert Aruho, head of veterinary services at MKWC, said: “The real work now begins. We must ensure that the animals released can thrive and survive in the sanctuary and, eventually, the wild. “This is the culmination of dedicated conservation work that has spanned almost two decades. It marks the single most significant step towards the survival of the mountain bongo in history.” The pristine sanctuary consists of a natural forest that provides an extensive range to continue releasing the mountain bongos in preparation for their survival in the wild. The government’s long-term vision is to achieve a population of 750 in Kenya by 2050. Every year, 10 mountain bongos will be released into the sanctuary in groups of five every six months. It is estimated that by 2025, the sanctuary will have 50 to 70 fully rewilded mountain bongos. Tourism and wildlife minister, Najib Balala, said: “The mountain bongo is one of Kenya’s most iconic animals, is critically endangered and can only be found in Kenya. The opening of the sanctuary is a critical step to help achieve [the rewilding process].” Weaning the animals from human dependence requires technical skills, patience and commitment to allow the animals to adapt independently. It also requires an appropriate habitat, foliage and enough space to exhibit normal wild animal behaviour. According to wildlife experts in Kenya, the long-term success of the release and eventual survival of the animals in the wild largely depends on local communities’ support in surrounding areas, since most of the threats that caused the population decline were human-driven. The conservancy is working with these communities to restore degraded areas within Mount Kenya’s forests through a reforestation programme. Under the partnership, the conservancy has involved 3,000 community members in planting more than 35,000 indigenous tree species, with plans to plant another 5,000 trees this year. Julius Kamau, chief conservator at Kenya Forest Service, said: “Collaboration is key for the successful protection of any endangered species. We will nurture these vital partnerships to achieve our shared goal of rewilding the rare antelopes, animals that hold great national significance in Kenya.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Hope for Kenya’s mountain bongos as five released into sanctuary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/hope-for-kenyas-mountain-bongos-as-five-released-into-sanctuary-aoe
3/16/2022,"Astronomers have recently become fascinated with FRB 121102. That’s the name given to a mysterious burst of radio-wave activity in space. It follows a repeating pattern: silence for 67 days, then several rapid spurts of excitement before another bout of nothingness. One theory is that the radio waves indicate the presence of a dwarf galaxy three billion light years away; another is that they are simply reflecting the recent pattern of play from a more familiar celestial body, Cristiano Ronaldo. The Fiver doesn’t know what to think. That’s OK, we have Tin. Anyway, it’s not up to us to figure out how long the 37-year-old’s bursts of activity can last these days and whether, following Saturday’s otherworldly hat-trick against the Harry Has-Been Team, he should be deployed from the start in Tuesday’s Big Cup showdown with Atlético Madrid. That’s a decision for Ralf Rangnick. The Fiver doesn’t know what to think about Rangnick. That’s OK, we have Tin. What we can say for sure is that the German has already pulled off one brilliant feat at Old Trafford by negotiating a deal whereby if he does a good job as interim manager, he could become the full-time manager – and if he does a bad job as manager, he could become the full-time manager’s boss. That’s some top, top politics! In fairness to Rangnick, he has only lost three of 19 matches in charge and there have been no humiliations quite like the ones endured by his predecessors, such as the 4-1 slippering by Watford or the 6-1 whipping by Spurs. And the first leg of the tie with Atlético yielded one of United’s best results under him, a 1-1 draw that leaves the contest right in the balance. So maybe he really could oversee an unlikely triumph, even if the deal he wangled is one of the reasons why it wouldn’t be right to class him alongside Tony Barton or Roberto Di Matteo. Or maybe, given how well this side tends to cope when the pressure is on, that epochal humiliation is coming real soon. Join Paul Doyle from 8pm GMT for hot Big Cup coverage of Manchester United 1-1 Atlético Madrid (agg 2-2 aet, 4-3 on pens), while Luke McLaughlin will be on hand for Ajax 2-1 Benfica (agg 4-3). “It is important for the competition that the match against Middlesbrough goes ahead, however it is with extreme reluctance that we are asking the FA board to direct that the game be played behind closed doors for matters of sporting integrity” – never underestimate football’s ability to misread a room after Chelsea call for Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final on Teesside to be played without fans. Remarkable. Boro’s response? “Given the reasons for these sanctions, for Chelsea to seek to invoke sporting ‘integrity’ as reason for the game being played behind closed doors is ironic in the extreme.” Here’s David Squires on … another festival of edification for English football. Get your ears around the latest Football Weekly podcast. “Re: Gordon Lee (yesterday’s Fiver letters). It was Duncan McKenzie who teased the Everton boss, not Malcolm Macdonald. Or so Duncan told me when I interviewed him for the NME in the late-70s, after he’d left Goodison for Blackeye Rovers. He was a funny lad, and evidently still amused by Mr Lee’s team talks” – Monty Smith (and others). “Having not seen Mr Roy’s new eyewear, I dutifully clicked on the link to the Watford Observer article (yesterday’s Fiver) where my eye was immediately caught by the avatar of senior sport reporter Ryan Gray sporting an England football top. It immediately occurred to me that Big Website’s roster of top journalism talent should do the same to demonstrate their commitment to and undying love for their chosen sport.

We already have Kieran ‘Bury Beckham’ Trippier. At this rate we’ll soon have a full XI of Bury-born namesakes. Maybe they could put on an exhibition game of some sort to save Gigg Lane” – Tom Dowler. “I’ve been searching for wit among the Bono- and U2-related correspondence (yesterday’s Fiver letters), but I still haven’t found what I’m looking for” – Martin Leaver.

3/16/2022,"The mother of Jake Davison, who shot her and four other people dead in Plymouth, Devon, had reported him to the government’s counter-terrorism Prevent programme months before he applied for a shotgun licence, a coroner has heard. Maxine Davison, 51, contacted the programme in November 2016 with concerns about her son but Davison applied for a shotgun certificate in July 2017 and a certificate was issued to him in January 2018. Davison, 22, who harboured extreme misogynistic views, killed his mother after a row and then shot dead four other people in an attack in August last year. Three-year-old Sophie Martyn; her father, Lee, 43; Stephen Washington, 59; and Kate Shepherd, 66, were attacked in the Keyham area of the city. The apprentice crane operator then turned the pump-action shotgun on himself before armed officers reached him. The killings happened only weeks after Devon and Cornwall police had returned the shotgun and licence to Davison, which had been seized after he assaulted two teenagers in a park. Full details of the Prevent referral were not disclosed during the pre-inquest hearing at Plymouth coroner’s court on Tuesday but will be a key line of inquiry at the full inquest, expected to begin in January 2023. Ian Arrow, the senior coroner for Plymouth and south Devon, said those running the Prevent scheme could be invited to be “interested persons”, meaning they could be legally represented and have the right to ask questions of witnesses. Davison’s contact with mental health services in May 2021 will also be examined, as well as an occupational health assessment he underwent. Jason Beer QC, representing Devon and Cornwall police, said the force was still actively investigating the events of last summer. This included examining Davison’s use of chatrooms on the social media site Reddit. “A review of Jake Davison’s computer and mobile telephone showed he was an active member of Reddit forums,” Beer said. “Some of these were ‘incel’ [involuntary celibate] related.” He said Reddit had almost immediately deleted Davison’s account once the shootings took place. “Reddit declined to assist in any dialogue for the provision of that material,” he said. The barrister said police had commissioned psychological reports into mass killers, incel-motivated killers and steroid abuse. He said a review of the force’s firearms licensing system had taken place, leading to procedures being changed and extra training being given. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has been investigating issues around Davison’s shotgun licence. Two members of staff in the firearms licensing department involved in granting the shotgun certificate have been served with gross misconduct notices, while an officer has been served with a misconduct notice. The IOPC said on Tuesday its investigation into Davison’s possession of a shotgun and shotgun certificate was complete and it had made a series of recommendations to help improve licensing arrangements at a force and national level. It said it would discuss with the coroner when it would release its findings. A further pre-inquest review will take place on 19 December.",News/UK news,Mother of Plymouth shooter reported him to Prevent anti-terror scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/15/mother-of-plymouth-shooter-reported-him-to-prevent-anti-terror-scheme
3/16/2022,"As Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has her British passport returned amid reports the UK government has paid a decades-old £400m debt to Iran in a move that could facilitate her release from Tehran, we take a look at the British-Iranian woman’s continuing nightmare, which has lasted nearly six years. 3 April 2016 Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national aged 37, is arrested by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards at Imam Khomeini airport and then held in solitary confinement. She was visiting Iran on holiday to allow her parents to meet her 22-month-old daughter Gabriella. At the time she was employed by Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity that promotes socio-economic progress. She had previously worked for the BBC as an administrator. The reason for her arrest was not made public but she was later accused of spying – a charge she denied. 9 August 2016 The prime minister, Theresa May, raises concerns about the Zaghari-Ratcliffe in a call with the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani. The intervention came after Nazanin’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, criticised ministers for failing to condemn the arrest of his wife. 9 September 2016 Zaghari-Ratcliffe is jailed for five years following a conviction on charges that remained secret. 21 November 2016 Zaghari-Ratcliffe is said to be at “breaking point” after beginning the first of several of hunger strikes. She ends it five days later amid family fears for her health. Ratcliffe continues to question why the government has not done more to secure her release. April 2017 Zaghari-Ratcliffe loses a final appeal against her sentence. May raises her plight with Iran, according to a Foreign Office statement. August 2017 Ratcliffe warns that his wife is in a “fragile state” and has been diagnosed with advanced depression. “She’s been talking in very dark terms about what she might do,” he says. 17 October 2017 Tehran’s prosecutor general, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, claims Zaghari-Ratcliffe has links with the UK government. He claims she had been training journalists at the BBC and ran an online course that trained participants in encryption. 1 November 2017 The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, makes a blunder that sets Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case back, by giving credence to Iran’s false claims about her. He tells the foreign affairs select committee: “When I look at what Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was doing, she was simply teaching people journalism as I understand it.” Zaghari-Ratcliffe had worked for an online BBC World Service Trust journalist training course, but it was a purely administrative role, booking Iranian and other students on courses. The Foreign Office later insists Johnson’s remarks provided “no justifiable basis” for further legal action against Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but it concedes Johnson “could have been clearer”. 12 December 2017 Johnson says he had frank discussions in Tehran with his Iranian counterpart about Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s case. The talks came after Johnson met Ratcliffe to discuss his wife’s plight. But Ratcliffe’s hopes of securing her release before Christmas are dashed. 14 February 2018 Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s family claim her treatment amounts to torture. They later accuse Iran of holding her because of a financial row. The dispute concerns a longstanding £400m debt Britain owes to Iran, the advance payment for a shipment of tanks that was never fully delivered. 21 May 2018 Zaghari-Ratcliffe is told to expect another conviction after she goes to court to face new charges. 3 August 2018 The new foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, promises to do all he can to secure Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release, after talks with her husband. 23 August 2018 Zaghari-Ratcliffe is temporarily released from prison for the first time since she was arrested, raising hopes that Iran is softening its stance. But after being reunited with her daughter, Zaghari-Ratcliffe is returned to prison after three days. Soon afterwards she collapses in prison. 26 December 2018 Zaghari-Ratcliffe spends her 40th birthday in prison in Iran after Tehran ignores fresh calls for her to be released. 14 January 2019 Zaghari-Ratcliffe goes on a three-day hunger strike to protest against her treatment in prison. 24 April 2019 Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, raises hope of Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release by suggesting she could be freed in exchange for an Iranian woman held in Australia. The minister later retracts his remarks. 28 May 2019 The Guardian reveals that the Ministry of Defence has rejected a plea from the Foreign Office to hand over the £400m owed by the UK government to Iran. Iranian authorities have not made an explicit link between the outstanding payment and the fate of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, but in private Iranians cite the £400m as one reason for the lack of trust between Tehran and London. 15 June 2019 Both Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her husband stage hunger strikes in protest at her continuing detention. At the end of the 15-day protest, Ratcliffe calls on Johnson to take responsibility for the mistakes he made in the handling of the case. He says: “Not just the gaffe – the failure to apologise afterwards clearly made things worse.” 25 September 2019 Johnson, now prime minister, calls for the immediate release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals imprisoned in Iran during a meeting with Rouhani at the UN in New York. 29 December 2019 Zaghari-Ratcliffe goes on hunger strike in solidarity with Kylie Moore-Gilbert, an academic also being held in Iran. 3 January 2020 The US assassination of the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani prompts Zaghari-Ratcliffe to have panic attacks over fears of Iranian reprisals. 23 January 2020 Ratcliffe and Gabriella, now five, meet the prime minister in Downing Street with no sign of a breakthrough. 29 February 2020 Zaghari-Ratcliffe is suspected of contracting coronavirus following an outbreak at Evin prison, where she is being held. The jail refuses to test her. 17 March 2020 Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is temporarily released for a second time but is required to wear an ankle tag and not move more than 300 metres from her parents’ home. The temporary release is later extended, raising hope of a clemency deal. 20 May 2020 Zaghari-Ratcliffe is told she can remain out of prison until a decision is made on whether to grant her clemency. 25 August 2020 Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s lawyers accuse the British government of deliberately delaying steps necessary to secure her release – including payment of the £400m – for fear of offending the Trump administration. 8 September 2020 Iran’s state media says Zaghari-Ratcliffe is due in court to face a new unspecified charge. 26 April 2021 An Iranian court sentences Zaghari-Ratcliffe to a one-year jail term and bans her from leaving the country for a year after. Her lawyer Hojjat Kermani says an appeal is being lodged on the basis that the charges were laid out of time. 23 September 2021 Iran demands that Britain repay its £400m debt and take serious steps to lift sanctions, in a meeting with the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. The meeting takes place on Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s 2,000th day in detention in Iran. She is staying with her mother in Iran, pending an appeal against her additional sentence of one year. 24 October 2021 Ratcliffe begins another hunger strike outside the Foreign Office in an attempt to persuade the UK foreign secretary to do more to bring his wife back from detention. He ends it after 21 days. 10 December 2021 UK government officials have travelled to Tehran to discuss legal ways to pay Britain’s £400m debt to Iran, the Iranian ambassador to London says. 15 February 2021 Truss says she hopes Britain will soon be in a position to pay the £400m to Iran, according to an Iranian account of a phone call between her and her Tehran counterpart. The two countries insist that the debt has always been treated as independent of the fate of Zaghari-Ratcliffe. 15 March 2021 Zaghari-Ratcliffe has had her British passport returned.

3/16/2022,"“Seemingly every day, Russia becomes more and more isolated from the rest of the world,” said Trevor Noah on Monday’s episode of the Daily Show. “They can’t fly anywhere, they can’t order anything off of Amazon, they can’t even use Airbnb, which means now they need to film themselves going to the bathroom. “And every day, the Russian people become more cut off from the truth about the war,” he continued. The Kremlin has shut down independent media, yet one person managed to slip an anti-war message onto state television: during a Monday evening broadcast, Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, burst onto the set of the nightly news, shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” She also held a sign which read: “Don’t believe the propaganda. They’re lying to you here.” It was signed in English, “Russians against the war.” Ovsyannikova’s protest, visible for several seconds before the channel switched to a pre-recorded segment, was “one of the bravest things I’ve ever seen,” said Noah. “Although, knowing Russia’s propaganda machine, it’s probably going to find a way to like twist this whole thing. They’ll be like ‘you saw the sign, there is no war. Everything is normal. All good.’” In another crackdown on free speech, the Kremlin has also taken Facebook, Twitter and Instagram offline. Given 48 hours notice by the government, many Instagram influencers released distraught final videos. “It feels like a big part of my heart and my life is being taken away from me,” said Russian reality TV star Olga Buzova in a tearful video. “If you thought being a Ukrainian refugee was bad,” said Noah, “imagine being forced to pick up your whole life on Instagram and move it over to Cameo. That’s tragic.” “Trump’s buddy Vladimir Putin is doing whatever he can to prevent Russian citizens from knowing the truth about what he’s up to in Ukraine,” said Jimmy Kimmel on Monday evening, from bans of Instagram and Facebook to rumors spread by the Kremlin that the US trained birds to carry Ukrainian biological weapons in to Russia. “Which, listen, the only deadly bird we’ve developed in this country is this one,” he said over a picture of the Twitter logo. “And we’re primarily using it on ourselves.” In other news, “Yesterday, Tom Brady, the greatest quarterback of all time, woke up, noticed daylight saving time, and thought ‘What should I do with this extra hour of sunlight? I know: I’ll play a 23rd season of football.” Forty-one days after he announced his retirement, the seven-time Super Bowl winner announced that he will play another season of football with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “Tom Brady is like your friend who announces she’s quitting Instagram and then posts something three hours later,” Kimmel noted. “I guess he realized that if he retired there wouldn’t be anyone around to make sure Gronk doesn’t eat a gallon of tide pods.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on day 19 of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and “things are going nyet bueno” for Putin; Russia has gained limited territory and suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment. According to one report, Russians were so confident of a swift victory that instead of bringing extra ammunition or rations into Ukraine, they brought dress uniforms for a victory parade. “Kinda jumped the gun guys,” said Colbert. “That’s like scheduling your first Tinder date at the altar.” According to reports, desperate Russians have taken to breaking into supermarkets and shops, and raiding homes in search of food and valuables as their own supply lines have failed. “Reminder: they’re just 90 miles from their home bases,” said Colbert. “That’s like driving from New York to Philly and turning cannibal at Trenton.” “With his invasion going poorly, Putin has only one man to blame: anyone but him,” Colbert added, noting reports that Russian spy chiefs have been placed under house arrest. “That’s right, they’re stuck at home with nothing to do except watch the popular Russian reality show ‘Love is Blindfolded and Thrown into a Van.’” Putin has also reportedly fired generals in response to his invasion losses. “Of course he fired them!” Colbert exclaimed. “They allowed Ukrainians to capture their greatest weapon: truckful of onions.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers tore into Donald Trump for reckless comments about leveraging US nuclear power in Ukraine. “I think it goes without saying that this is a very precarious moment in which reckless military escalation could lead to even more catastrophe,” said Meyers. “We need to help the millions of people who are suffering and support diplomatic paths toward an end to the conflict. “The last thing we need right now is, I don’t know, a former president bragging that is he were still in office he would use nuclear weapons,” such as Trump did on Fox News last Thursday. “Biden, every time he gets up he says ‘they are a nuclear nation,’” Trump said. “He should say we are a nuclear nation, and you know, I rebuilt our whole nuclear arsenal stronger, bigger, better than ever before. It’s better and it’s bigger than Russia.” “Everybody knows that we’re a nuclear nation,” Meyers retorted. “Is that one of those things that he just found out and he thinks he’s the only one who knows?”",Arts/Culture,Trevor Noah on anti-war message on Russian TV: ‘One of the bravest things I’ve ever seen’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/15/trevor-noah-anti-war-message-russian-tv-bravest-thing-ive-ever-seen
