5/10/2022,"Good morning. A pro-Kremlin outlet has called Vladimir Putin a “paranoid dictator” in a rare act of dissent. Patients are increasingly waiting more than 24 hours for a bed in overcrowded Victorian emergency departments. And Guardian Australia has spoken to early voters in two key Sydney seats. With 12 days to go in the federal election campaign, both leaders are shifting into higher gear. After questions about stamina following his Covid recovery, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, yesterday cheerfully told his trailing press pack that he was hitting three states in a day, a marked uptick in the pace of his campaign. Labor and the Coalition had big ticket announcements yesterday, with Albanese pledging more than $346m for a hospital upgrade and to boost teacher workforce numbers, while Scott Morrison talked up $8bn in military spending on helicopters and infrastructure. With two leaders’ debates down and one to go tomorrow, the home stretch is within sight. But early polling centres in two key Sydney seats may reveal the direction this could go. Guardian Australia asked people who they were voting for – and why. Two Russian journalists working for a popular pro-Kremlin website filled it with anti-war articles in a rare act of dissent as the country celebrated the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. The articles on Lenta.ru called Vladimir Putin a “pitiful paranoid dictator” and accused him of waging “the bloodiest war of the 21st century”. “We had to do it today,” said Egor Polyakov, one of the two journalists. “We wanted to remind everyone what our grandfathers really fought for on this beautiful Victory Day – for peace.” During his annual speech in front of 11,000 soldiers in the Kremlin, Putin sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine, tying the fighting to the Soviet victory in the second world war. Peak healthcare bodies in Victoria are calling for real-time data on emergency departments, warning that staff are being forced to work “blind” amid unprecedented pressure. The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine has labelled the situation in hospitals across the country a “national emergency” and its Victorian chair, Dr Mya Cubitt, said hospitals needed a statewide dashboard with real-time data. Peter Dutton’s department says the defence minister is in possession of six reports from the oversight panel regarding the Brereton reforms – but he is yet to disclose any details about what it found. Far from having a leftwing bias, the ABC has been tamed by cuts and incessant attacks, former prime minister Kevin Rudd says. Under the Coalition, the national broadcaster has been domesticated to the point of overcorrecting for perceived partisanship, he says. Ten weeks after Lismore first flooded, fewer than one in six applications for the NSW government’s business grants have been approved. Praise for Josh Frydenberg, the “prince of tennis” and “super scholar” is circulating on the Chinese-language internet platform WeChat targeting the Kooyong community, whose votes will be critical on election day. Reforms to reduce the use of grants for pork barrelling need to be enacted before next March’s state election if the NSW government wants to protect its credibility, crossbenchers and a former supreme court judge have said. A chorus of crossbenchers have demanded that the premier, Dominic Perrottet, introduce legislation based on recommendations handed to the government at the weekend. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, is set to become the Philippines’ next president after taking an unassailable lead in the election, signalling an extraordinary rehabilitation of one of the country’s most notorious political families. Elon Musk has warned that Japan will “cease to exist” unless it addresses its falling birthrate, sparking calls for the country to allow more immigration and improve its work-life balance. Emmanuel Macron has called for a new political organisation to unite democracies on the European continent, as he warned that Ukraine would probably not join the EU for several decades. Mahinda Rajapaksa has resigned as Sri Lanka’s prime minister after months of protest over the country’s deepening economic crisis and calls for leaders from the ruling family dynasty to step down. When evangelical Americans began talking about Donald Trump as God’s chosen president, the religious phrasing around his leadership – miracles, destiny, calling – triggered something in the memories of Lynette Wallworth, the Emmy-winning Australian virtual reality film-maker. As a young woman, she had been drawn into a Pentecostal community and came to hold “extreme beliefs” about God’s will. She became a “prophetess”; fellow members would come to her with questions to hear her “give prophecy” from literal and earnest biblical interpretations. With her latest work, she hopes to stop others from doing what she did. In a landmark exhibition supported by the resources sector, Indigenous artists from the Pilbara don’t hold back about dispossession and exploitation. “This is a protest painting,” says Martumili artist Desmond Taylor. “We’re hoping to get back the land that was taken away from us. This is our story, this is our home, this is our way of finding connection to country.” Over the last two years, most of us have experienced the sting of a party cancellation – from weddings and galas to school formals. There was a period when crowded dancefloors and uncomfortably high heels felt like a thing of the past. Happily, it’s 2022, and we are – hopefully – post-lockdowns and limits on gatherings. To celebrate, well, the return of celebrations, here is some expert advice on the special care everything from tulle, to beading, to lace requires. With house prices and rents continuing to soar across Australia, the major parties are talking up their respective homebuying policies on the campaign trail. But will these policies actually fix Australia’s housing affordability crisis? Laura Murphy-Oates speaks to economics reporter Peter Hannam and Prof Hal Pawson about the housing policies of Labor, the Coalition and the Greens, and what impact they would have on housing affordability.

O’Hea alleged in a TV interview on Sunday that unconfirmed claims that Cambage told Nigerian rivals to “go back to your third-world country” in a practice game that contributed to her messy exit from the national program were true. With every goal scored, trophy lifted and piece of history recorded, Sam Kerr continues to raise herself into a pantheon reserved for a select few in Australian sport. The Matildas captain helped lift Chelsea to a third consecutive Women’s Super League title on Sunday with a stunning brace. The Greens are pushing for zero extinctions by 2030 as they outline their $24bn environmental policy, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. About 2 million of the nation’s 17.2 million enrolled voters have applied to cast their ballot by mail, meaning a significant chunk of votes will not be counted on 21 May, says WAtoday.

5/10/2022,"Patrick Roberts scored on the final day of last season to help send Sheffield Wednesday down to League One, and the winger condemned the Owls to another season in the third tier with an injury-time winner to put Sunderland 90 minutes away from promotion. The match was heading into extra-time after Lee Gregory slid the ball home to cancel out Ross Stewart’s first-leg winner but Roberts pounced in the 10 minutes of time added on to earn victory for Sunderland thanks to fine work by Jack Clarke on the left, who tricked his way inside the box before fizzing it into the path of Roberts. The duo once cost a combined £21m, which proved handy to Alex Neil. A packed Hillsborough roared every touch from a Sheffield Wednesday player in the early stages. The biggest cheer of the opening five minutes was saved for Sunderland’s Alex Pritchard when he leapt over an outstretched leg on the edge of the box, only for the referee and home supporters to show the midfielder what they thought of his artistic attempt to win a free-kick. Needing a goal to level the tie, Wednesday could only bide their time for so long, especially due to the fact Sunderland had one eye on the clock from the first whistle. Goalkeeper Anthony Patterson was harangued whenever it was deemed he had held onto the ball for an extra split-second. Barry Bannan’s intelligence on the ball ensured the surround sound did not stop. Whenever the midfielder collected a pass, the volume was raised in expectation. When he did finally measure a pass perfectly, Josh Windass whipped a shot at goal, only for Danny Batth to be in the way. Bannan raised the noise levels once more just before the half-hour mark when he slid in to catch Pritchard on the top of his boot with his studs, forcing referee, James Linington, to take out his yellow card, much to the disgust of Hillsborough. It took 35 minutes for a shot on target, and it came in an unlikely form. A Wednesday corner was sent back into the box where George Byers choreographed a perfect overhead kick, only to send the ball straight into Patterson’s waiting arms. For a game that lacked quality, there was plenty of intensity and ferocity to make up for it. Sunderland’s first show of intent came from a well-worked corner soon after the break found its way to Clarke‘s feet but he could only drag his shot wide from inside the area, leaving Sunderland to wait even longer for a first attempt on target. Sunderland were better at disrupting Wednesday in the second half, upsetting the home team and fans alike. There was a demand for urgency to avoid the game slowing down but poorly-timed challenges and misplaced passes allowed the visitors to keep the game at more sedate to increase frustration inside Hillsborough. Bailey Peacock-Farrell was finally forced into a save with almost an hour gone. Clarke dribbled across the box searching for an opening to fire at goal and when he could not find one, he laid the ball off to Roberts whose curling shot was easily held. The home fans were becoming increasingly annoyed by Sunderland’s tactics to slow the game down. Pritchard, an unpopular figure in Sheffield, delayed taking a corner to bring to the referee’s attention an item that had been thrown on the pitch, ironically allowing the midfielder to stop play. It took a moment of Championship quality in a game firmly mired in the third tier to finally take the roof off Hillsborough. Bannan’s defence-splitting pass to help set up Lee Gregory’s finish was needed in a match more focused on tackling and time-wasting than skill and ability. After 74 minutes of irritation, Hillsborough could scratch the itch. Bannan slipped a pass inside Lyndon Gooch for Marvin Johnson to run onto and cut back straight into Gregory’s path, gifting him the chance to tap home from a few yards out thanks to his slick movement. All the blue and white frustration was released, replaced with ecstasy and bouncing stands. Sunderland seemed happy to hold on for the extra period, which could be a tiring affair considering the officials added on 10 minutes of injury-time due to constant stoppages in play but their fans were the only ones who made all the noise in the silence when Roberts darted in to become the hero after Clarke’s brilliance.

5/10/2022,"Who could have foreseen, when Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu was born in what is now Skopje, North Macedonia, in August 1910, that she would become one of the icons of the 20th century, recognised across the globe as Mother Teresa, saintly giver of comfort to the destitute? More specifically, who could have predicted that she would embody so much of what was wrong with that century and the next? The three-part documentary Mother Teresa: For the Love of God? (Sky Documentaries) sets out the pros and cons of Teresa mania, finding the good to be fragile and the bad, profound.Briskly we are given the backstory of a family made vulnerable by the death – perhaps by poisoning – of their patriarch, after which they leaned heavily on the church. Having moved to India and become a nun, Anjezë heard the voice of Jesus calling her on a train near Darjeeling in 1946. By 1969, she was revered enough under the name Mother Teresa of Calcutta – as the boss of donation-funded sanctuaries for orphans, people with leprosy and the dying – for a laudatory BBC film to be made about her. The attention boosted Teresa’s effort to expand her organisation, Missionaries of Charity, beyond India, opening orders around the world. For the Love of God? tries to offer an unimpeachably balanced range of contributors. In the absence of the late Christopher Hitchens, the writer best known for cutting down Teresa, Aroup Chatterjee, whose work inspired Hitchens’ film about her, appears, offset by a couple of friendly biographers and with first-hand witnesses to the work of Missionaries of Charity in the middle. The problem, for Teresa’s defenders, at least, is that as soon as you mount a description of her that goes into more detail than “she spent her life caring for the poor”, the illusion melts.An American woman who signed up for the mission, and who felt an electric charge akin to romantic love when Teresa put a hand on her as a welcome blessing, describes how the nuns’ devotion required being cut off from newspapers, radio and contact with friends. A craze for self-flagellation developed among the “sisters”, inspired by Teresa’s dictum that “love, to be real, has to hurt”. Even a man who was a Kolkata orphan stricken with polio in the late 1970s, and who credits the Missionaries of Charity with saving his life, talks of the psychological effects of the sometimes “brutal” atmosphere. Episode one’s killer witness is Dr Jack Preger, whose 40 years as a “street physician” in Kolkata brought him into contact with Teresa’s sanitoriums. “The nuns were not delivering proper care,” he remembers, visibly hurt at the memory. “Needles were used over and over again. They were blunt.” This is the most serious charge levelled at Teresa: that there was insufficient practical assistance, and perhaps even outright neglect, behind the rhetoric about selflessly attending the needy. What is extraordinary about the stronger version of that accusation – that Teresa embodied a pain-cult version of Christianity that does not want to alleviate suffering – is that she basically agreed. Over to one of the friendly biographers, reporting what her idol used to say: “Our calling is not necessarily to cure. It is to pass on the love of God to every human being in whom we see the suffering Christ … suffering shared with Christ’s passion is a wonderful thing.” Archive clips of adulatory TV interviews show how, once the brand was established, complaints about this startling ethos were dismissed as heresy, with the backing of the powerful. For the Love of God? shows how figures such as Teresa are a key component of unjust societies, dabbing balm on the consciences of those who send “thoughts and prayers” to the vulnerable while ensuring they remain so. It is OK for us to concentrate wealth in fewer and fewer hands at the expense of the masses: someone, somewhere will help them. One thinks of David Cameron tweeting photographs of himself visiting food banks he helped to create, having encouraged the “big society” to care so that he didn’t have to.But, by happenstance, the programme is more timely than that. Next week, the series delves into the rise of the American religious right in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan, and how Teresa helped it by campaigning against the “pure murder” of abortion. Such hatred is afoot again in the US. Harsh as For the Love of God? may have ended up being on an individual whose flaws were magnified by a fame she couldn’t control, the portrait showing where dogma and hysteria can lead is painfully pertinent.Anyway, she would not have minded. For the Love of God? ends its opening instalment with a statement from Missionaries of Charity, which continues Teresa’s work: “If she were alive today, she would pray for her accusers and forgive them.”",Arts/Television & radio,Mother Teresa: For the Love of God? review – damning testimony from a killer witness,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/09/mother-teresa-love-of-god-review-damning-testimony-killer-witness-saintly-flagellation
5/10/2022,"Manu Tuilagi’s previous ploys to stay injury-free have included going to see a witch doctor, walking the Peak District, and weight loss – but now the England centre has concluded there is no substitute for sleep. Tuilagi is fit again, in form, and if he was unable to prevent Sale from exiting the Champions Cup at the quarter-final stage for the second consecutive season on Sunday he demonstrated his sharpness with a well-taken try on the stroke of half-time that would have thrilled Eddie Jones. With the Premiership playoffs a distant prospect for Sale, Tuilagi is likely to have just two more domestic matches this season but, provided there are no further injury problems, he is certain to tour Australia with England for a three-match series Jones’s side cannot afford to lose. For Tuilagi, it has yet again been a stop-start season blighted by injury with another Six Nations campaign missed and 10 appearances for the Sharks. He is learning to accept the logic in sitting out the odd match – he was rested for Sale’s victory against Newcastle to ensure he was primed to face Racing 92 – but there is fuel in the tank to face the Wallabies and, all going well, serve as a reminder as to why England’s hopes at the World Cup next year largely hinge on his fitness. During the Six Nations, Tuilagi was due to play against Wales, having recovered from the hamstring injury sustained last autumn against South Africa. He had a setback in training just before that match, however, and having made only two appearances for Sale before being called upon by England the national side faced questions over rushing him back too quickly. Not from Sale it should be said, but Alex Sanderson, the club’s director of rugby, conceded that more dialogue between club and country would benefit all parties, with Sale having already borrowed a GPS unit from England so that the national coaches could monitor his progress. For Tuilagi, the key is recognising the need to recover, and to rest. “I think sleep is a big thing for me,” he said. “I never used to sleep … I used to sleep really late. For an athlete you need, for me, at least seven hours. So that’s what I looked at when the latest hammy happened. If you keep doing the same thing, you are going to get the same result. So you’ve got to change something. “I had a chat with my wife, actually. I was talking to her, saying to her about how I woke up 20 minutes, 30 minutes before we had the walk-throughs and then you get into training … like, I am saying to her sometimes it’s actually hard, you have to take ownership of it and be honest with yourself, because only you know what’s happened. And my wife is saying: ‘You’re an athlete, you’ve got to sleep.’ We had that chat and then you’ve just got to be honest with yourself. And you’ve got to change something if you want a different result.” If Tuilagi made a conscious effort to trim a few pounds at the end of last season, he has lost nothing in terms of power. His mental strength is arguably his greatest asset, however, time and again demonstrating an ability to stay sanguine whenever the latest injury setbacks strike. “I am really thankful for those injuries that I came through,” he said. “And just in life you are definitely going to go through some hard times – I bet you guys have come through some tough times in your life – and that’s a good thing, because you can only learn from that, as a feeling. You can’t learn from someone else’s mistakes, because you don’t feel it. But when you have that, you’ve got to embrace it. It’s not good at the time but you look back and think: ‘Yah, it was good, that.’ “It’s more the mental side of the game that is much more important than the physical side of the game. The game is so physical nowadays, but if your mind is stronger, mentally, nothing can stop you. You have to listen your body but as an athlete sometimes you get too excited and you just want to be out there on the field. And you ignore what your body is telling you. You’ve just got to listen to it. Because if your body says no, you can’t do anything.”",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi believes sleep holds key to staying fit for Sale and England,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/manu-tuilagi-sale-england-summer-tour-australia
5/10/2022,"The year the world breaches for the first time the 1.5C global heating limit set by international governments is fast approaching, a new forecast shows. The probability of one of the next five years surpassing the limit is now 50%, scientists led by the UK Met Office found. As recently as 2015, there was zero chance of this happening in the following five years. But this surged to 20% in 2020 and 40% in 2021. The global average temperature was 1.1C above pre-industrial levels in 2021. It is also close to certain – 93% – that by 2026 one year will be the hottest ever recorded, beating 2016, when a natural El Niño climate event supercharged temperatures. It is also near certain that the average temperature of the next five years will be higher than the past five years, as the climate crisis intensifies. “The 1.5C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,” said Prof Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, which published the new report. “For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise,” said Taalas. “Alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme.” Natural climate cycles can nudge global temperatures up or down. But the Paris Agreement requires nations to hold the underlying rise, driven by human activities, to well below 2C, as well as pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. The world’s scientists warned in 2018 that 1.5C of global heating will bring severe impacts to billions of people. “A single year of exceedance above 1.5C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5C could be exceeded for an extended period,” said Dr Leon Hermanson, at the Met Office. “The possibility of surpassing the 1.5C threshold, even if only for a year, is worrying,” said Dr Andrew King, at the University of Melbourne. “Our greenhouse gas emissions are still at near-record highs and until we get emissions down to net zero we’re going to continue to see global warming. Rapid and drastic emissions reductions are needed urgently.” “To actually exceed the [Paris] target we’d have to be above 1.5C even in a ‘normal’ year” unaffected by natural climate variations, said Prof Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales. “But the report reminds us that we are getting uncomfortably close to this target.” The annual forecast harnesses the best prediction systems from climate centres around the world to produce practical information for decision-makers. It found a higher chance of rain in 2022 compared with the average of the past 30 years in northern Europe, the Sahel, north-east Brazil and Australia, while drier conditions than usual are forecast for south-western Europe and south-western North America. Prof Taalas also warned of especially rapid heating at the north pole: “Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us.” The shrinking of sea ice and its knock-on effects have been linked to extreme weather events in Europe, the North America and Asia, including heatwaves, floods and even snowstorms. The forecast indicates that the rise in Arctic temperatures will be three times greater than the global average over the next five years.",News/Environment,"Climate limit of 1.5C close to being broken, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/09/climate-limit-of-1-5-c-close-to-being-broken-scientists-warn
