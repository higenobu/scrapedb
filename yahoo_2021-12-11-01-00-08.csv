12/11/2021,"U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said this week that mouthwash is one way to protect from COVID-19 but the manufacturer of Listerine and medical experts say studies of the idea haven't yet concluded it's a proven antidote. Johnson in a town hall event on Wednesday said a ""standard gargle"" of mouthwash ""has been proven to kill the coronavirus"" or may reduce viral replication to help protect from a serious surge of COVID-19 cases. ""Why not try all these things?"" he said, including mouthwash in a list of alternatives to COVID-19 vaccines and face masks, like taking supplements of Vitamin D, Vitamin C and Zinc. Subscribe to our On Wisconsin Politics newsletter for the week's political news explained. In a statement to the Journal Sentinel, Johnson said he was not suggesting vitamins or mouthwash was a replacement for COVID-19 vaccines. ""I did not say that taking vitamins, using mouthwash, would be a replacement for the vaccine, should you choose to get one. There are multiple studies that say mouthwash may reduce viral load,"" Johnson said. ""Even Dr. Fauci said, ‘I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.’ I continue to be amazed at the resistance to anything that might reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.” Johnson regularly promotes unproven remedies for COVID-19 and expresses doubt in proven ways to combat the pandemic like vaccines. In this case, Listerine mouthwash's effect on disrupting the virus is being studied but its manufacturer and medical experts said the research has not produced the conclusion Johnson suggested to his constituents on Wednesday. More: 'Fundamentally dangerous': Ron Johnson has long history of promoting views at odds with scientific research ""We are aware of several ongoing, independent clinical trials where LISTERINE® is being assessed in patients with COVID-19. However, the current available data is not sufficient to support a conclusion that the use of LISTERINE® mouthwash is helpful against the COVID-19 virus,"" said a statement from Johnson & Johnson shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""Our understanding of the course of COVID-19 disease transmission continues to evolve. Overall, more research is needed to understand whether use of mouthwashes can impact viral transmission, exposure, viral entry, viral load and ultimately affect meaningful clinical outcomes or have a public health impact."" Johnson & Johnson officials said it would ""consider further investment in lab and clinical studies with trusted collaborators, playing an important role in understanding the interaction between oral care and the COVID-19 virus in the mouth."" Ben Weston, an associate professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Chief Health Policy Adviser for Milwaukee County, said mouthwash kills germs in a person's mouth but ""it does not have the same effect on the rest of your body."" ""The COVID-19 virus enters through the nasal passages and can ravage your lungs, causing difficulty breathing. It can damage your heart causing scarring and decreased cardiac function. It can damage the lining of your blood vessels causing clotting. It can damage your kidneys, leading to long term organ failure. It can damage your reproductive system, leading to poor birth outcomes and erectile dysfunction. The list goes on,"" Weston said. ""We need to focus on prevention that works. The COVID vaccines are safe, they are effective and they are free."" Weston said vaccines make it less likely to get infected in the first place, less likely to transmit the virus to someone else, less likely to experience serious illness after infection, and less likely to get hospitalized or die of the virus. More: Dr. Ben Weston works ER shifts, advises policymakers and educates the public about COVID. It's a heavy load and he thrives on it. Ajay Sethi, associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, said no one is discouraging the use of the remedies Johnson is proposing but the public should know they are not proven to be effective in protecting against COVID-19 infection. ""Things like home remedies, vitamins and supplements, new diets have been advertised to and used by people in our society for decades, centuries even, for all sorts of ailments. No one is discouraging their use, but they do not provide tangible benefit against Covid, and they are not a substitute for vaccination,"" Sethi said. Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington, said Johnson's suggestion to turn to vitamins and mouthwash ""is not appropriate for any virus."" ""Our recommendations are for folks to get vaccinated (3 doses, get a booster as soon as they are eligible), wear a mask (good quality mask and wear it correctly), watch their distance, avoid gathering, and wash hands,"" Mokdad said by email. In his comments on Wednesday, Johnson criticized the National Institutes of Health for focusing on the recommendation to get vaccinated against the virus. Patrick Remington, a former epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's preventive medicine residency program, said the NIH relies on proven treatments. ""Simply put, the NIH and other researchers set a high bar for proving that a treatment is effective. Studies done in the lab or in animals, or clinical anecdotes play an important part in the research process, and lead to hypotheses that are then tested in rigorous, controlled trials,"" Remington said. ""It would boggle my mind if we skipped this critical step, and instead practiced medicine based only on hunches and best guesses. We need to be patient and let the scientific process play out, and make sure that we first do no harm."" Sethi noted 200 million Americans have chosen to take the advice of the CDC, NIH, and numerous medical and scientific experts to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

12/11/2021,"With elite investors like Michael Burry and Jeremy Grantham predicting a reckoning for today’s overheated stock market, it might be time to look at dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are a way to diversify a portfolio that may be chasing growth a little too obsessively. They generate income in good times, bad times and, particularly important today, times of high inflation. They also tend to outdo the S&P 500 over the long run. One prominent portfolio that’s heavy on dividend stocks belongs to The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. With the trust being used to pay for so many initiatives, income needs to keep flowing into it. Dividend stocks help make this happen. Here are three dividend stocks that occupy significant space in the foundation’s holdings. You may even be able to follow in its footsteps with some of your spare change. It’s not the most glamorous of industries, but waste management is an essential one. No matter what happens with the economy, municipalities have little choice but to pay companies to get rid of our mountains of garbage, even if those costs increase. As one of the biggest players in the space, Waste Management remains in an entrenched position. The shares have more than doubled over the past five years and are up about 42% year to date. Management is projecting 15% revenue growth this year. Currently offering a yield of 1.4%, Waste Management’s dividend has increased 18 years in a row. The company has paid out almost $1 billion in dividends over the last year, and its roughly $2.5 billion in free cash flow for 2021 means investors shouldn’t have to worry about receiving their checks. As a company whose fortunes typically follow that of the larger economy — that’ll happen when your equipment is a fixture on building sites the world over — Caterpillar is in an intriguing post-pandemic position. The company’s revenues are feeling the effects of a paralyzed global supply chain, but still-historically low interest rates and President Joe Biden’s recently passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill mean there could be an awful lot of building going on in the U.S. in the near future. Caterpillar’s mining and energy businesses also provide exposure to commodities, which tend to do well during times of high inflation. The company’s stock has ridden higher raw material and petroleum prices to an almost 15% increase this year. After announcing an 8% increase in June, Caterpillar’s quarterly dividend is currently at $1.11 per share and offers a yield of 2.2%. The company has increased its annual dividend 27 years straight. With grocery stores deemed essential businesses, Walmart was able to keep its more than 1,700 stores in the U.S. open throughout the pandemic. Not only has the company increased both profits and market share since COVID coughed its way across the planet, but its reputation as a low-cost haven makes Walmart many consumers’ go-to retailer when prices are rising. Walmart has steadily increased its dividends over the past 45 years. Its annual payout is currently $2.20 per share, translating into a dividend yield of 1.6%. After trending slightly downward over the past month, Walmart currently trades at roughly $136 per share. If that's still too steep, you can get a smaller piece of the company using a popular app that lets you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. At the end of the day, stocks are inherently volatile — even those that provide dividends. And not everyone feels comfortable holding assets that swing wildly every week. If you want to invest in something that has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market, take a look at some unique alternative assets. Traditionally, investing in fine art or commercial real estate or even marine finance have only been options for the ultra rich, like Gates. But with the help of new platforms, these kinds of opportunities are now available to retail investors, too. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
