1/5/2022,"So, Anthony Charles Lynton “call me Tony” Blair must now be called Sir Tony. In addition to being “Right Honourable” he is to be the Queen’s Companion, chivalrous and knightly. He is to wear a royal garter, the highest honour the monarch can bestow, and it is her personal decision. Gasps all round. A petition of protest has received almost 700,000 signatures already. On paper the reason for the garter, not a normal knighthood, is that Blair was once prime minister and all former holders of that office get one, as they once got earldoms. James Callaghan did, as did Margaret Thatcher. The difference is that Blair’s honour has been delayed for 15 years. The palace might argue that there are only three vacancies in the 24-strong companionship and there are four ex-prime ministers waiting, along with other worthy candidates.  That does not explain the delay in Blair’s case. In the light of history, Blair was not a peculiarly bad prime minister. In winning three general elections he might even be rated a success. The two wars into which he led his nation, in Afghanistan and Iraq, were heavily supported by some at the time. But the charge against him, as confirmed by the Chilcot report, is that he woefully misled parliament and the public in stating his case. Hundreds of Britons and tens of thousands of foreigners died – and are still dying – as a result of Britain’s participation in those wars. Plenty of people did not think much of Thatcher, who also went to war, but no howl greeted her garter. The Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has suggested that all ex-prime ministers should be knighted on leaving office, simply for having done “one of the toughest jobs in the world”. Like permanent secretaries, senior judges and (most) Commons Speakers, they deserve a farewell pat on the back, and a knighthood comes cheap. To this extent, Blair would be entitled to his reward. But, in that case, someone should have said so and done it. As it is, the delay over Blair looks like a deliberate judgment somewhere in Buckingham Palace. Were some courtiers muttering, “Must we really, what with Iraq and all that?” Were others saying, “It’s over, just get on with it”? As for numbers, they might hope that with a bit of luck, next-in-line Gordon Brown will refuse, and David Cameron can be dumped in the Lords, where his recent misdeeds will vanish in its mire of sleaze. In other words, the delay in the award to Blair could indeed be a royal comment on his botched job – at which point we should best treat it as matter closed. More evidence, if it were needed, that our entire “honours” system and its associated nomenclature is an outdated mess. Britain has inherited an honours system that, like its Church of England and parliament itself, is shrouded in past fashion and fancy language that it seems incapable of reforming. Honours are divided between people who get them through their job, people who merit them and people who buy them. The cynicism of Boris Johnson’s (and Cameron’s) purchased honours has brought the House of Lords to a new low. I can think of no other democracy where membership of its parliament is so brazenly up for sale. It is not good enough to say it does not matter much. If it is to serve as the nation’s comment on the performance of public figures, a system of honours should convey meaning, not time-serving. In a climate of sleaze and corruption, the case is overwhelming for a commission to clean up and modernise the hierarchy of national awards. Parliament, politics and Downing Street should have nothing to do with it. We can eliminate archaic references to empires, saints, baths, garters and chivalry. We can stick to orders of merit. As for prime ministers, their reward is best kept in heaven, or at least confined to the lucrative lecture circuit and memoir catalogue. It is there that the nation can best express its appreciation of their work. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,'Sir Tony Blair'?

1/5/2022,"Up to 10 rapid antigen tests will be offered free to more than 6 million concession card-holders under a new national cabinet agreement but everyone else who is not a close contact of a case and symptomatic will still have to pay. State and territory leaders met on Wednesday to consider how to overcome the national testing crisis which has seen pathology services overwhelmed, rapid tests in short supply, and price gouging by some retailers.  Dismissing growing calls for universal free access to rapid antigen tests (RATs), the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said national cabinet had agreed to provide the tests to concession card-holders through the national pharmacy network. Supplies will become available within the next two weeks and limited to 10 each over the next three months – with no more than five per month. The 6.6 million people eligible include those with commonwealth seniors cards, healthcare cards, low-income cards, pension cards and DVA gold and white cards. With the peak in Omicron cases still weeks away, national cabinet also signed off on additional measures to ease pressure on state testing sites and pathology services, which have been plagued by delays.The changes include ditching a requirement that someone who tests positive using a RAT confirms the result with a PCR test and exempting truck drivers, those being admitted to hospital, and overseas travellers from most testing requirements. Queensland and Tasmania will continue to require RATs for travel into those states until vaccination rates reach certain thresholds but travellers will no longer be able to access rapid tests at clinics in Victoria and NSW. The federal government will also seek to shield businesses from occupational health and safety obligations that may be requiring businesses to compulsorily test employees. “If you are not a close contact, if you are not symptomatic, you do not need to get a test – that is the advice,” Morrison said. If you do fall into that category testing is free, he confirmed on Wednesday. “We need to ensure that we are focusing those testing resources on the essential tests that are required, not casual tests.” Morrison, whose proposal for cash payments for RATs was overruled by the state and territory leaders in favour of using the pharmacy network, said none of the leaders had argued for universal access to free rapid tests. “To make that very clear, universal free access was not considered the right policy response by all of the states and territories in attendance today,” Morrison said. The cost for the concessional tests will be split between the commonwealth and the states. Morrison said securing supplies had been the responsibility of state governments but the commonwealth had secured an extra 20m rapid antigen tests with 10m of these to be provided to the states to be used as “point of care” tests administered by health professionals. A total of 200m tests are now forecast to arrive in the country over the next two months but the prime minister warned that the pressure on the testing system would continue over the coming weeks. “Not only I, but all the chief ministers and premiers all understand the challenges currently being faced across the country, particularly in relation to the testing queues, we understand is incredibly frustrating and is highly disruptive, particularly the people’s plans at this time of year,” the prime minister said. He said this was the result of the “volume challenges” posed by the Omicron variant and dismissed suggestions the commonwealth should have secure additional RAT supplies earlier. The federal government is also making changes aimed at preventing price gouging and hoarding, using changes to the Biosecurity Act to prevent retailers from putting more than a 20% mark-up on tests. Penalties include jail terms and fines of up to $66,000. When asked how many tests he had personally paid for, Morrison suggested his wife, Jenny, had purchased them when needed for private purposes, but otherwise he had used stock provided by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, provided on Wednesday an update on the current wave, saying that over the past fortnight while case numbers grew, the hospitalisation rate went down as did the proportion of cases in intensive care. Morrison said state and territory governments would develop a system for reporting positive Covid cases using rapid antigen tests, but in the meantime, he encouraged anyone who tested positive using an at-home kit to contact their GP. The decision to restrict the access of free tests comes despite a growing chorus in support of making the rapid antigen tests free, including from health experts, unions, business groups, and the federal opposition. “It’s very clear the simplest way to do it is to make tests free and make them available,” the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said ahead of the meeting. “People are crying out for action, the economic consequences of this government’s failure to put in place a proper system are there for all to see.” The Australian Medical Association called for the government to abandon its market-based approach and provide the RATs publicly. The AMA and the Public Health Association of Australia said freely accessible rapid tests would play an “essential role in a pandemic that is looking increasingly out of control”. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said the government was “running out of time to get widespread use of RATs in the community underway and support people to do the right thing”. The head of the influential Doherty Institute, Sharon Lewin, also recommended making the tests free as the country shifted its approach, telling ABC’s 730 program on Tuesday night tests should be “widely accessible and free”. The National Council of the St Vincent de Paul Society said the tests needed to be made free to everyone but particularly the most vulnerable. “We urge all governments to ensure people with disability or other vulnerabilities, and the people who support them, have free and easy access to these tests,” the national president, Claire Victory, said. The Australian Youth Affairs Coalition also raised concern about the prohibitive cost of tests for young people which was “impacting their ability to remain safe”. Amid the rolling testing crisis, the government has been encouraging Australians to take up booster vaccines to try and limit the spread of infections. A total of 176,223 third doses were administered on Tuesday. More than 64,000 Covid cases were reported nationally on Wednesday – up from 48,000 the previous day. It was the highest daily total during the pandemic in Australia. NSW registered a record high 35,054 cases and eight deaths, while Victoria reported 17,636 cases and 11 deaths. Tasmania had a record 867 infections, with Queensland reaching 6,781, SA with 3,493, the ACT 810 and the Northern Territory 117.",News/Australia news,Coalition won’t budge on free rapid Covid tests for all but concession card-holders are covered,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/coalition-wont-budge-on-free-rapid-covid-tests-for-all-but-concession-card-holders-are-covered
1/5/2022,"Alvin Kamara, the versatile running back for the New Orleans Saints, went a little ballistic in March after he found out that the NFL was about to add a 17th game to the regular season. Kamara tapped out a four-word tweet: Two were curses, and a third was “dumb”. Even though the NFL agreed to pony up a bigger share of its revenue to the players, Kamara and many others were not so keen on a 17-game regular season, because they’d be expected to actually play in them (the players’ union passed the new schedule by just 60 votes). A 16-game schedule was already punishing enough.  As it turned out, Kamara must wait to find out what it is like to play 17 regular-season games, because, owing to the hazards of his occupation, Kamara missed four straight games late in the season with knee and hamstring injuries. But at least Kamara will be one of the lucky ones who gets to play in a meaningful 17th game. If the Saints (8-8) beat Atlanta (7-9) on Sunday, and San Francisco (9-7) lose to the Los Angeles Rams (12-4), New Orleans will earn the final NFC wildcard playoff berth. There are other games worth watching, namely the season-ending matchup between the Los Angeles Chargers (9-7) and Las Vegas Raiders (9-7), with the winner going to the playoffs and the loser done for the year (though there is an unlikely way both could make it, ugh). But only three of 14 playoff spots are still up for grabs, hardly a rousing crescendo. A year ago, going into the final weekend of the 16-game regular season, seven spots were unclaimed. Six of eight division titles have been clinched, the same as at this point last year. This year, 11 of the 16 games on the final weekend of the regular season carry playoff implications – including seedings – the same as last year. Green Bay (13-3) have wrapped up the NFC regular-season title and a first-round bye, though Aaron Rodgers says he will play Sunday despite a nagging toe injury, and Tennessee (11-5) can do the same in the AFC on Sunday by beating the terrible Texans (4-12). Even the slog for the No 1 overall pick in this year’s draft carries little suspense, because Indianapolis (9-7) need to beat awful Jacksonville (2-14) to clinch a wildcard playoff berth – and because the Jaguars already have the guy they want to rebuild around, rookie quarterback Trevor Lawrence. There is no consensus No 1 draft pick this year, let alone a quarterback that scouts see as a surefire star. Many games will serve as essentially open auditions for players to get a few more highlights on tape so their agents can shop them around in the off-season. As a result, the games might not look much different than the fourth preseason contest that the 17th game replaced. So what has the extension accomplished? Well, more all-important incoming cash for the teams, of course, but not any more drama. For this, you can partly blame the NFL’s desire to expand beyond the US. When the NFL announced the expansion of its schedule, commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement, “One of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world.” What he meant, to be specific, is the ability to schedule four games per season outside the US, with each team required to play at least one game on foreign soil every eight years. Not only do the players get to play more games, more than a few will get to travel a bit more. Those trips – and a little more money – may be one of the few benefits to players. Pro football players are paid pretty well, relatively speaking. The minimum NFL salary in 2021 was $610,000 for a player with no experience and $1.05m for players with at least seven years’ experience, many times more than the median US wage of $56,000. But the average NFL career only lasts a little more than three years and players tend to break down, something a longer regular season will probably only exacerbate. The battered Baltimore Ravens (8-8) still have a chance to make the playoffs if they beat Pittsburgh, and the Chargers, Colts and Dolphins lose (or if Miami tie). But only three players who started on offense for the Ravens in their season opener also started last weekend against the Rams. The coronavirus, to which no team seems to be immune, has shredded plans this year. The Philadelphia Eagles, needing a Minnesota loss Sunday to Green Bay to clinch a playoff spot, appeared to benefit from the absence of Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins. And then, boom! Twelve Philadelphia players were placed on the Reserve-Covid 19 list Monday afternoon. Even if the season were virus-free, a 17th game offers another opportunity for top players to shine – or get hurt, diminishing the quality of play in the short and long term. Goodell claimed in March that more players get hurt in preseason games, side-stepping the fact that top players participated very little, if at all, in those fourth preseason games. Besides, whoever ends up winning the Vince Lombardi Trophy won’t be the first NFL champion to have played 17 regular-season games. The 1926 Frankford Yellow Jackets won 14, lost one and tied two. The Yellow Jackets played four Saturday-Sunday home-and-away sets. But there were no playoffs, so they were awarded the title by a consensus of reporters. The designated championship game, played before 7,000 chilly fans at Frankford Stadium in Philadelphia, was a dud: a 0-0 tie with the Pottsville Maroons. A 40-yard field-goal attempt was caught by a gust of wind, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the 10-yard line. So there have been more anticlimactic finishes to the NFL regular season. Just wait for Sunday night. The Raiders and Chargers may play to a tie. The Chargers would get in, but so would the Raiders if the Colts also lose.

1/5/2022,"Having secured their first signing of the January window in agreeing a £12m (and rising) fee for Atlético Madrid and England full-back Kieran Trippier, Newcastle hope to further bolster their hopes of avoiding relegation by bringing an injury-prone Welsh midfielder to Tyneside from Turin. Speculation abounds that Aaron “Rambo” Ramsey could swap the black and white stripes of Juventus for those of the slightly less decorated English club, although reports he has turned down an approach from Burnley because he wants to sit in the physio room of a more high-profile club suggest Newcastle’s owners will have to dig deep in a bid to turn his head. Ramsey has also been linked with a return to Arsenal and could share a taxi from Luton airport to their nearby St Albans training ground with his Juve teammates Dejan Kulusevski and Arthur Melo. Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Arsenal have formally bid the thick end of £45m (plus the £15m-rated Lucas Torreira) for Fiorentina’s 21-year-old Serbian striker Dusan Vlahovic, who already has 16 Serie A goals to his name this season. A player in big demand across Europe, Vlahovic seems happy enough where he is for the time being. “Only God knows what will happen in the next period,” he said recently. “My desire is to take Fiorentina to Europe, because we haven’t been in Europe for a long time. We’ll see.”  Chelsea, West Ham and yes, you’ve guessed it, Newcastle are all interested in liberating French left-back Lucas Digne from his Everton purgatory, but will have to pay up to £30m to get their man. “The most important thing for me is having players on the pitch who want to be there,” said beleaguered Everton boss Rafa Benítez after dropping Digne and playing right-back Séamus Coleman in his position in defeat against Brighton on Sunday, in a state of affairs that suggests the player will be shown the Goodison door this month unless his manager goes first. Manchester United central defender Axel Tuanzebe’s season-long loan to Aston Villa has been brought to a premature end after Villa boss Steven Gerrard refused to give the 24-year-old assurances he’d get game time in the second half of the season. He’ll be off to Napoli. Arsenal midfielder Ainsley Maitland-Niles is another young buck who could be Serie A-bound and may wrap up his loan to Roma on Wednesday. Having been forced to read an entire paragraph without seeing their club being linked with anybody in today’s Mill, Newcastle fans will be pleased to learn that Flamengo striker Gabriel Barbosa wouldn’t be adverse to a move to St James’ Park despite the resident club’s lowly league position, but is also wanted by goal-shy Wolverhampton Wanderers. Depending on your news outlet of choice West Ham definitely do or do not want the 25-year-old Brazilian international, but are reported to have definitely cooled their interest in Adama Traoré. Aymeric Laporte could become the latest player to tread the well worn path between Manchester City and Barcelona, with the Catalan club apparently prepared to send Frenkie de Jong the other way in a swap deal. And finally, rumours abound that the worrying number of preening, self-regarding and under-performing divas who currently occupy the Manchester United dressing-room continue to scoff at the notion that they might be in any way responsible for their poor performances and are already plotting a mutiny against recently-appointed manager Ralf Rangnick, with whom they are reported to be underwhelmed.",Sport/Football,Football transfer rumours: Arsenal make bid for Fiorentina’s Vlahovic?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/05/football-transfer-rumours-arsenal-make-bid-for-fiorentina-dusan-vlahovic
1/5/2022,"In welcoming you to the first Guardian Weekly magazine of 2022, I’d like to start by rewinding a couple of years. Buried in the 10 January 2020 edition was a small but significant story. “Respiratory contagion is not Sars, authorities say” was the headline on a short global report, at the foot of page 7, about a mysterious infection in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.  Two years on, it’s fair to say we now know a little more now than we did then about that mysterious illness. But the broader context of the pandemic can still be tricky to understand. This week, the Guardian’s data and visuals teams have collaborated to produce some beautiful graphics and analysis, revealing the pandemic’s global impact in a new light. Then, our China affairs correspondent, Vincent Ni, explores why, after two years, the search for Covid’s origins remains shrouded in politics and confusion. The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell for sex-trafficking offences concluded one of the most closely followed trials in recent times. Will this draw a line under the case – or will US prosecutors’ attention now turn to other known associates and employees of the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein? South Africa has been in the news lately, for the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant and for the death of Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Both stories have touched on issues of governance in the “rainbow nation” (as Tutu described it after the fall of apartheid), so it is both sad and disturbing to read Jason Burke’s dispatch on how many citizens seem to be losing faith in the power of government altogether. It wouldn’t be a new year’s edition without pause to reflect on personal goals for the coming months. Johann Hari unpacks the fascinating topic of concentration, asking why so many of us have lost our ability to focus, and if it’s too late to do anything about it.

1/5/2022,"The year 2022 – which launches into the Olympic Games in Beijing and ends with the World Cup in Qatar – is set to be a great year for authoritarian regimes looking to cover up their atrocious human rights records. Over the course of a 12-month period, countries such as China, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, all of whom have been criticized for human rights violations, will use prestigious sports events to polish their public image on an international stage. This process is known as sportswashing, a term popularized by Amnesty International in 2018 to describe the use of sports by oppressive governments to legitimize their regimes and distract from their human rights abuses. Traditional examples of sportswashing include the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin under the Nazi regime, which Hitler hosted in an attempt to showcase German and Aryan superiority.  While sportswashing has long been a popular tactic, 2022 is a particularly concerning year because both the Olympic Games and the World Cup – the two most-watched sporting events in the world – are being hosted in countries with markedly oppressive regimes. Beginning on 4 February, China will host the Winter Olympics in Beijing and in towns in the neighboring Hebei province. Among other issues, the country’s government has been criticized for its inhumane internment of Uyghur Muslims in the Xinjiang region, its attempts to seize political control over Hong Kong and neighboring Taiwan, and the disappearance (and questionable reappearance) of tennis star Peng Shuai after accusing a Chinese official of sexual assault. Several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have announced that they will not send any government representatives to the Games due to concerns over China’s human rights record. However, these nations will still send their athletes, rendering the diplomatic boycotts as little more than performative theatre. Other countries such as France (host of the 2024 Summer Games) and Italy will not join the boycott, while Russia’s President Vladimir Putin condemned the boycott as a “mistake”. China has since threatened that the countries who have announced diplomatic boycotts will “pay the price for their mistaken acts.” Following the Olympic Games, attention will shift towards the World Cup in Qatar, which is set to begin in November. The nation has a significant record of human rights violations. For example, a Guardian investigation from February 2021 revealed more than 6,500 migrant workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have died in Qatar since 2010. The shocking death toll, compiled from government sources, is most likely an underestimate and does not include data from other countries that send a significant number of workers to Qatar, including Kenya and the Philippines. Dozens of migrant workers have died during the construction of World Cup stadiums in particular, and more than 100 migrants employed on a construction project related to the event went up to seven months without pay. Most employees were eventually compensated, though some still have several months of missing salaries. Other significant human rights issues in Qatar include restrictions on free expression, forced labor, the criminalization of same-sex relationships, and a lack of accountability for violence against women and minorities. Reforms aimed at protecting migrant workers from exploitative labor were introduced in 2020, though employers maintain disproportionate power and influence. Despite the harrowing reports of death and abuse in the construction of World Cup stadiums, Fifa president Gianni Infantino announced on 30 December that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was a “celebration of football and social inclusion”. “Fifa is the only governing body that looks after and cares about the entire world,” Infantino said in a prepared statement. “We will continue working hard to live up to the mission of not forgetting the ones who need most and who have no voice, while also protecting the healthy growth of everyone else and the global football movement.” While China and Qatar will host the two most significant sports events of 2022, other countries such as Saudi Arabia continue to expand their positions as key destinations for international sports events. The kingdom has spent billions on high-profile sports events aimed at strengthening its reputation and diversifying its economy to eliminate dependence on oil and gas. Most recently, a group led by Saudi’s sovereign wealth fund – an entity headed by Crown Prince Mohamed Bin Salman – purchased Newcastle United. It is arguably one of the kingdom’s most successful sportswashing attempts, as it provides Saudi with an influential position in English football as well as an opportunity to upgrade its public image and distract from its recent abuses, including the infamous assassination of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, its devastating war in Yemen that caused a humanitarian catastrophe, and its crackdown on intellectuals, reformers, and women’s rights activists. Saudi Arabia has proved to be an alluring hub for sports events over the past few years, having signed a 10-year, $650m deal for a Formula One motor racing event, invested millions in a Saudi International golf event, and hosted some of the biggest boxing showdowns in recent memory. The kingdom has also hired the Boston Consulting Group to help lobby its interest in hosting a World Cup event in the not-so-distant future. There are other concerning sportswashing affiliations, including the Ultimate Fighting Championships’ troubling links to Chechnya’s dictator Ramzan Kadyrov, the NBA’s blossoming relationship with Rwandan autocrat Paul Kagame, and the NFL’s newly announced five-year partnership with China (which included a map that pushed the false narrative that Taiwan, an independent country, was a part of China). Each of these examples highlights the growing trend of authoritarian countries using prominent and established sports entities as platforms for propaganda and sportswashing campaigns. This strategy has proven to be remarkably effective in overhauling these states’ public images and legitimizing their regimes. As state-run political projects and soft power propaganda outfits take center stage over the coming year, 2022 is shaping up to be one of the most politically charged sporting years in recent memory.",Sport/Sport,Could 2022 be sportswashing’s biggest year?,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/sportswashing-winter-olympics-world-cup
1/5/2022,"The travel industry is calling on ministers to remove all remaining Covid testing requirements for international travellers, arguing they are damaging the travel sector and will not affect the spread of the Omicron variant. Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and the trade body Airlines UK said in a joint statement that research they commissioned into travel restrictions supported the position that the removal of travel testing requirements would not affect overall cases rates and hospitalisations in the UK.  The two organisations said the research showed that domestic rather than international restrictions would be the only way to reduce Omicron’s spread within the country. Ministers introduced additional testing requirements in late November and early December because of fears about the spread of the newly identified variant. All passengers arriving in the UK have to take a pre-departure Covid test, taken no more than 48 hours before setting off for the UK. In addition, travellers are required to take a PCR test within the first two days after their arrival. MAG, the UK’s largest airport group, which runs Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, has sent ministers its research, before a government re-examination of rules for international travel on Wednesday and amid reports that the pre-departure testing requirements are set to be dropped at the review. MAG’s chief executive, Charlie Cornish, and the Airlines UK chief executive, Tim Alderslade, urged the UK government to immediately remove what they called “emergency restrictions”. They said: “Travel restrictions come at huge cost to the travel industry, and to the UK economy as a whole, placing jobs at risk and holding back the recovery of one of our most important sectors. It is therefore vital they do not remain in place a day longer than is necessary.” MAG said passenger numbers at its airports fell by more than 30% in early December after the introduction of new testing requirements. Tim Hawkins, the chief of staff at MAG, said the group had understood that travel restrictions would be removed “if they stopped playing a useful role in limiting spread of the virus”. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Between October and November, passengers responded to the lifting of travel restrictions very positively and we were seeing a good level of recovery coming through. But the new measures at the end of November and December knocked that back by about a third.”",News/Business,UK travel industry urges ministers to drop international Covid tests,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/05/uk-travel-industry-international-covid-tests
1/5/2022,"Vulnerable Covid patients are set to miss out on the lifesaving treatment sotrovimab, doctors say, because it must be taken within five days of getting sick. Waiting times for PCR tests and results, a lack of rapid antigen tests, and the need for a GP referral could mean treatment comes too late, according to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.  The health minister, Greg Hunt, announced on Monday that the federal government had bought an additional 45,000 units of sotrovimab, bringing the national stockpile to 81,000. The monoclonal antibody treatment is designed to help those who become ill with Covid and have risk factors including lung, heart or kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, being over the age of 65, and undergoing cancer treatment. Clinicians can consider its use for women in their second or third pregnancy trimester. It has a 79% effectiveness rate at reducing serious illness, hospitalisation and death. Mark Morgan, professor of general practice at Bond University and chair of the college’s expert committee on quality care, said GPs were “crying out” for clear clinical pathways to use the treatment. “To be effective, it has to be given in the first five days [after symptoms appear], and there are all sorts of problems with getting tested and finding out if your symptoms are from Covid or not because people can’t access the PCR or rapid antigen tests,” he said. “So there are lots of difficulties finding out if you’ve got Covid, then another layer of difficulty playing catch ups with the health systems as to who would access this medicine and how it would be given. “It has to be injected over half an hour, and [the patient then has to be] watched for an hour. And this is someone who’s infected.” Morgan said he didn’t think many GPs would have the proper setup established to deliver the treatment themselves and would probably then refer the patient to hospital. “The thing I’m most concerned about is the delays in testing capacity, delays in results, lack of knowledge about the treatment options in the community, so that people will miss out on the treatments.” With the focus on vaccinations, he said, treatments for the infected had been overlooked. “They let [Covid] rip before they had their ducks lined up,” he said. It’s also unclear how long the 81,000 treatments would last. In a press release from August 2021, Hunt said: “Medical experts estimate that eight to 15 per cent of adults with COVID-19 will be recommended for treatment with sotrovimab.” With more than 271,000 new cases this week, if 15% were eligible, around half the existing stockpile would be needed. At the lower end of 8%, the treatments would last four weeks if case numbers did not go up at all. However, the range of 8% to 15% was estimated before the Omicron variant arrived and before high vaccination levels were achieved, which could affect the numbers of people eligible. The United States currently has a sotrovimab shortage. Sotrovimab is an “artificial copy of natural immunity, made in a laboratory and injected into a vein,” Morgan said. It would not help someone with full immunity, but those who were not vaccinated or had underlying conditions could be kept out of hospital. Rapid antigen testing, if made widely available, would speed up access to sotrovimab. Morgan said he would like to see a greater focus on available treatments as infections rise. According to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, there is a critical shortage of one form of heparin, a blood-thinning drug that has been shown to block the transmission of Covid when used as a nasal spray. There is also a critical shortage of dexamethasone, a steroid medication which can help critical Covid cases. However, there is often a “reasonable alternative” to such drugs. Morgan expects Covid case numbers to keep rising sharply, and said GPs wanted guidance.
