2/28/2022,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Russian rouble tumbled to a record low against the dollar on Monday, after Western nations announced a harsh set of sanctions over the weekend to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including sanctions on the country's currency reserves. The dollar/rouble rate was up 41.50% at a record 119.00 per dollar, in Asian trading. So far this month, the dollar is up 53.77% versus rouble. Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday, in response to Western reprisals for his war on Ukraine - the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Russia's central bank announced a slew of measures on Sunday to support domestic markets, as it scrambled to manage the fallout of the sanctions that will block some banks from the SWIFT international payments system. The central bank said it would resume buying gold on the domestic market, launch a repurchase auction with no limits and ease restrictions on banks' open foreign currency positions. The currency had found some support last week from the first Russian central bank currency interventions since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Analysts at Rabobank said the sanctions on currency reserves removed what little support the rouble had. ""Even the gold is not liquid if nobody can use FX in exchange for it. There will be a complete collapse in the rouble today..."" they wrote. Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank, said in a note on Sunday, ""a collapse in the rouble appears inevitable on Monday morning"", and there was an increased risk of a Russian debt default as a result of the weekend developments. ""For the rouble whilst you might see it should sell off somewhat, I really doubt you are going to see people put on fresh bets to sell the rouble at these levels – so you might well see it weakening, but I don’t think you will see people transacting all that heavily,"" said Peter Kinsella, London-based global head of FX strategy at UBP. ""There is a general lack of liquidity, and where you do see liquidity it is one sided, skewed to rouble sellers. It will be tricky, I can see rouble weakening quite severely – but just because it is weakening doesn’t mean it will be transacting heavily.""

2/28/2022,"By Jonathan Stempel (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit swelled, boosted by gains in many of its businesses and common stock investments such as Apple Inc, and said annual earnings reached a record high. Berkshire also signaled renewed confidence in its own stock, repurchasing $6.9 billion in the quarter, and boosting total buybacks in 2021 to a record $27 billion. But the pace of buybacks has slowed, with Berkshire, whose share price is just 2% below its record high, repurchasing just $1.2 billion of stock in 2022. In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said buybacks make ""good sense"" when alternatives such as buying whole companies or more stocks appear ""unattractive."" He also expressed confidence in Berkshire's dozens of operating businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer, after having gone six years since a major acquisition and letting Berkshire's cash stake swell to $146.7 billion. ""Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions,"" Buffett wrote. Quarterly operating income rose 45% to $7.29 billion, or approximately $4,931 per Class A share, from $5.02 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $4,251 per Class A share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. ""Overall results looked good,"" said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research with a ""hold"" rating for Berkshire. ""Many industrial and consumer businesses benefited from the tailwind of an economic recovery. She said 2022 could be tougher for top-line and margin growth because of inflationary pressure, including higher fuel and other input costs, and geopolitical pressure."" For all of 2021, operating income rose 25% to $27.46 billion, topping the previous record $24.78 billion set in 2018. Net income more than doubled to $89.8 billion, aided by the stock prices of Berkshire's largest stock investments--Apple, Bank of America Corp and American Express Co--which each rose by more than one-third. Buffett considers net income a misleading performance measure because it includes gains and losses from stock holdings, regardless of what Berkshire buys or sells. CRASHES AFFECT GEICO Quarterly operating results benefited from improvement in property and casualty insurance operations, offset by rising accident claims at the Geico auto insurer as people drive more. James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" said insurers are raising premiums to offset crash losses, and that higher premiums should be a ""pretty strong catalyst"" for improvement at Geico in 2022. Seifert, however, said the deterioration in claims trends in life insurance ""won't turn around in the next couple of quarters. That affects underwriting profitability for reinsurers such as Berkshire."" The BNSF railroad, one of Berkshire's largest units, boosted profit 13%, helped by higher shipping volumes of consumer products, industrial products and coal. Profit also rose 11% at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, as units including PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy reported benefiting from higher margins and increased income tax benefits. Precision Castparts, an aircraft and industrial parts unit that took a $9.8 billion writedown in 2020 as plane production and air travel plummeted, boosted full-year pretax earnings 79% after eliminating more than 13,000 jobs, though revenue fell 8%. A quick recovery for Precision's aerospace business isn't likely, Berkshire said, citing supply chain disruptions and Boeing Co's ""significant inventory levels"" following quality issues with its 737 and 787 planes. Berkshire's share price rose 30% in 2021, topping the 29% gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 including dividends, and ending two years of significant underperformance relative to that index. They are also outperforming in 2022.

2/28/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- First, it was inflation. Then came shaky tech earnings. Now, Russia. Slowly, then all of a sudden, forces are gathering that threaten to wring out the excesses that defined the post-pandemic era in markets. Most Read from Bloomberg EU Discusses Sanctions on Tycoons; Euro Slides: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea West Cuts Some Russian Banks From SWIFT, Sanctions Central Bank Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ Within the span of a month, sentiment toward risky assets -- which bordered on euphoric -- has shifted dramatically. Speculative equities that went straight up for years have fallen back to earth, brought down by the prospect of higher interest rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked fears of a global energy crisis and raised the specter of stagflation. It all adds up to a remarkable coda to a two-year run that saw financial assets of all kinds soar as the Federal Reserve’s pandemic response flooded the system with money. The result: Gambler spirits have cooled, the Nasdaq has been flirting with a bear market, and trillions of dollars are being erased from global stocks. On the way up, Wall Street’s old guard warned time and again that people would come to regret the prices they paid for everything from SPACs to meme stocks and crypto. With U.S. shares now down in five of the past eight weeks, they’re feeling vindicated, as tightening monetary policy and war endanger what has been the most dramatic episode of speculation since the dot-com bubble. Wherever you look, markets appear vulnerable. “Zombie companies, non-earning companies, the ones that were getting rewarded for seemingly no reason -- they are the ones that are suffering the most, and regardless of how much they’re suffering, they’re not going to go back to those levels,” said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. “The sea change is that ‘Oh, we can’t pump liquidity into the system forever,’ and we shouldn’t.” Nobody is saying the broader market is doomed. Dip buyers, emboldened by years of conditioning, came out in force the last two sessions, swooping in after the Nasdaq 100 Index nearly closed in a bear market. Still, it took weeks of damage to the major benchmarks before they surfaced this time, a departure from last year when a single day’s decline was almost always enough to coax out the bulls. For those who rode even relatively safe stocks skyward, there’s a sense the safety net has been pulled. Surging commodities will worsen inflation, leaving central banks handcuffed, sworn to higher rates and in no mood for the spendthrift rescues of yesteryear. The U.S. economy may be growing, but investors have pushed many share prices so far beyond expected earnings that even a 20% plunge would fail to make them obvious bargains. How extreme did pricing get? As recently as November, the Nasdaq 100 index was trading for almost six times the combined sales of its constituents, double the valuation of 18 months earlier and as high as any time in two decades. At 22 times annual earnings, S&P 500 companies were considered expensive at the start of 2020, before the Covid-19 crash hit. Within a year the ratio jumped to 32, nearly twice the historic level. Outside of the major indexes, the picture has frequently been one of full-blown bloat. Among smaller companies tracked in the Russell 2000, 47 surged 10-fold or more from the pandemic bottom through the end of last year. In February 2021, 93% of the index’s members were trading above their 200-day moving averages -- the highest percentage on record. “You had such crowded positions and you could see it in a variety of markets,” said Sameer Samana, Wells Fargo Investment Institute senior global market strategist. “You could see it in equities, with tech and other speculative stocks. You could see it in crypto, you could even see it in smaller cap stocks. We had this rolling bull market in risk assets in the fourth quarter when we realized that omicron wasn’t going to be as big of an issue as we had thought.” Even after rallying to end the week, the S&P 500 is still 8.6% below its all-time high set in January. Richly valued technology shares -- the stock market’s pandemic darlings -- are down more than 14% from their peak. While the revaluation has been swift, speculative areas are not out of the woods -- at least from a valuation perspective. The Nasdaq 100, which bounced in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion, fetches 32 times earnings, down from around 40 at several points last year, but still above its historical average. Lofty valuations of the pandemic era may have seemed justifiable against a backdrop of rock-bottom rates and billions of dollars worth of stimulus from the Fed each month. With the central bank set to lift rates and end its massive bond-buying program in March, risk assets were already under pressure to start the year. Now, as Russia sends troops into Ukraine and the U.S. levies sanctions, volatility is soaring. “With the amount of stimulus and liquidity in the system, valuations and expectations got silly,” said Dan Suzuki, Richard Bernstein Advisors’s deputy chief investment officer. “Now that liquidity is starting to tighten and growth is starting to slow, those trends have reversed.” In isolation, any of the threats facing investors might be navigable. The Fed is tightening, but from very low levels that aren’t likely to impede growth. Russia faces sanctions, but outside of its role as oil supplier it makes up a vanishingly small part of the global economy. And valuations are still high, but no worse than last year when stocks were surging. Put together, however, they are sowing a sense of exhaustion among traders, sapping sentiment as investors struggle to find reasons to be bullish. To be sure, reasons for optimism can still be found in corporate America, where analysts’ earnings estimates for S&P 500 have yet to budge from their solidly upward trajectory. That follows a reporting seasons in which 77% of the index’s members beat forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Since 1990 (when our data on forward earnings estimates begins), corrections that last at least 35 trading days have never been this large without a downward revision in earnings,” Bespoke Investment Group strategists wrote in a report. “That suggests analyst optimism isn’t a contrarian sell indicator at all but good news for stocks relatively speaking.” Still, RBA’s Suzuki sees the possibility of pain ahead for the poster-children of the pandemic rally: technology and growth stocks. Bets against them are accumulating: short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on the Ark Innovation exchange-traded fund (ticker ARKK) are sitting at a record 12.7%, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. “The elevated valuations embedded two unrealistic expectations. First, they assumed that the growth of the past several years was sustainable for the foreseeable future. And second, that all these new and innovative companies could turn out to be winners,” Suzuki said. “We think there’s still a bubble in parts of the equity market, and that bubble still has a lot of air in it.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek A Pandemic Baby Bump Shines a Spotlight on the Nordic Welfare Model Cyberwar: How Nations Attack Without Bullets or Bombs Removing Résumés From Hiring Process Can Improve Diversity Wall Street Is Buying Starter Homes to Quietly Become America’s Landlord Elon Musk’s Boring Company Plots Texas Tunnels ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Days of Easy Speculation Look Numbered in War-Shaken Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/days-easy-speculation-look-numbered-131500801.html
