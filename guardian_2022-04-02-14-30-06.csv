4/2/2022,"There are certain words I cannot bring myself to say out loud. Sometimes this is because of my accent – as an American I’ve never found a satisfactory way to pronounce “Torquay”, and I’ve stopped trying. If I had a story to tell you about something that happened there, I would probably just transplant the whole anecdote to another coastal town. Sometimes it’s just plain distaste – like with goujon – and sometimes it’s harder to explain. For the most part, it’s not a problem until it’s a problem. “We’ve got to do something about the thing,” I say, looking out the kitchen window one Friday afternoon. “The back end is leaning badly.” “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” my wife says. “The structure,” I say. “What structure?” she says. “In the garden,” I say. “The wisteria-supporting structure.” “The pergola?” she says. “It’s become detached at the back,” I say, “I think it might collapse.” “Just say pergola,” she says. “I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” I say. “But something must be done.” On Saturday morning I stand on the bench at the back of the garden to take a closer look. The structure was put up four years ago, by a man who did it quickly, without fuss or assistance of any kind, for a reasonable price. At the time I admired the upright solidity of the thing, but up close I can see that the rear has been bolted to an old wooden batten previously fixed along the top of the high brick wall – support for some unremembered arbour or trellis. That batten had rotted away, pulling off its bolts under the weight of the growing vines, leaving the right rear corner of the structure hanging. “I can do nothing,” I say, back inside. “It’s going to fall down.” “What is?” my wife says. “I don’t have the skills, or the tools,” I say. “Is this about the pergola?” she says. “But I’ll tell you what,” I say. “Whoever does fix it will have to dismantle it and start again.” “Can you just acknowledge that we’re talking about the pergola?” she says. “And that means cutting down the wisteria first,” I say. “Don’t touch that wisteria,” my wife says. “It took five years to flower.” “It’s out of my hands,” I say. But I can’t let go. I spend the afternoon watching YouTube videos of competent men installing similar structures in their own gardens, but they all start from scratch, doing everything right, with amazing cordless tools. At night I dream about it, trying to puzzle out a solution. I hatch a plan involving scaffolding planks and the jack from the car, but every time I run the model in my head it leads to catastrophic injury. After that I lie awake until the sky begins to pale. It reminds me of a long, distressing night I spent in a hotel in, let’s say, Paignton. On Sunday morning I make an announcement. “I think I can fix it,” I say. “Fix what?” my wife says. “First I need to buy some L-shaped braces,” I say. “Oh my God, is this about…” “These super-strong steel braces that I dreamed existed,” I say. “Possibly available from B&Q.” “How are you going to ask for what you want,” my wife says, “if you can’t say pergola?” “The point is, I can fix the braces directly to the wall, and let them take the weight.” “Of the pergola,” she says. “I’ll need to take some measurements,” I say. I drag a folding ladder to the end of the garden and climb up into the framework, wisteria tentacles whipping my face. The right rear corner of the structure is now a foot lower than the left. With both shoulders braced against adjacent roof struts, I climb to the top of the ladder – the paint shelf – and straighten my legs. With me as its support, the whole structure rises; but it’s still a good six inches short of level when I’m at full stretch. The ladder creaks alarmingly, and I have a vision of the kind of death that makes the local paper: Man Killed by Pergola. It sounds like a disease. “We’re back to square one,” I say, stepping into the kitchen. “Or a bit before square one, because I’ve made it slightly worse.” “Just leave it until the wisteria has flowered one more time,” my wife says. “Do nothing for four to six weeks?” I say. “I can handle that.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Tim Dowling: you say ‘pergola’, I’ll say ‘wisteria-clad garden structure’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/02/tim-dowling-you-say-pergola-ill-say-wisteria-clad-garden-structure
4/2/2022,"The Dominican Republic – not to be confused with the much smaller Caribbean island of Dominica – forms the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti. It is the most mountainous of all the Caribbean islands, with the highest peak, Pico Duarte, reaching an altitude of 3,098 metres (almost 10,200ft). Like other islands in the region, the climate is tropical: warm throughout the year. There are two distinct seasons: hot and muggy from May to October, and cooler and more pleasant from December to March; with April and November lying somewhere in between. Rain, too, falls mainly in the spring and summer months, averaging between 640mm and 2260mm (25 to 90 inches) a year, depending on the location. Along the northern coast, which is exposed to the northerly trade winds, winters can also be fairly wet. However, because the rain falls mainly in intense bursts and thunderstorms, the climate is generally very sunny throughout, with between six and eight hours of daily sunshine throughout the year; slightly more in the south of the island. Up in the mountains, however, temperatures can drop to as low as single figures, especially in winter; when wind chill from the trade winds can make it feel even colder. On the coasts, sea temperatures are mostly warm all year round.",News/News,Weatherwatch: the varying climate of the Dominican Republic,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/02/weatherwatch-varying-climate-of-dominican-republic
4/2/2022,"The war in Ukraine has come with an ever-present threat of cyber catastrophe, as experts and US military officials remain on high alert for potential hacks. And while the big one has yet to come, the battle online continues to escalate. UK intelligence officers warned on Thursday that Russia is increasingly seeking out cyber targets as its ground military campaign in Ukraine stalls. Additional reports on Wednesday revealed Russian hackers recently attempted to penetrate the networks of Nato and the militaries of some eastern European countries. These developments showed that “things are heating up” on the cyber front, said Theresa Payton, cybersecurity expert and former White House chief information officer. “We should prepare for the worst and operate at our best,” she said. Still, Payton noted, Russia had been very slow to deploy cyber tactics in the war to date. There could be a number of reasons for this, she said: Putin might not feel the need to use cyber-attacks in his strategy at this juncture in the war, or he might want to avoid additional retaliation promised by the US in the case of a cyberwar. Putin might also be “playing a long game” and having his cyber operatives infiltrate various adversaries and gain footholds, then wait until he decides to launch a cyber-attack. “It is possible that digital attacks are under way and not fully understood in the fog of a ground war,” Payton said. Although Russia has been slow to carry out major attacks, it has been targeting Ukraine in other ways. On 24 February, more than 10,000 modems of the satellite broadband provider Viasat were knocked offline in a hack that US officials have attributed to Russia. Although that attack sabotaged hardware across Ukraine and is continuing, it was more likely Russia would focus its resources on cyber reconnaissance missions than forceful attacks, said Glenn S Gerstell, former general counsel of the National Security Agency and Central Security Service. “We know Russia is quite sophisticated in cyber surveillance and in spying on their adversaries, and we can assume they would want to find out about sanctions and other intel,” he said. The US announced additional sanctions against Russia, including on its technology sector, this week. The White House said on Thursday that the US had evidence that the war against Ukraine had been “a strategic disaster” for Russia and would only worsen as sanctions increased. Gerstell said it was difficult to foresee what kind of offensive Russia would launch because its strategy throughout this conflict had been unpredictable. But Putin’s response might change as the situation on the ground does, he added. “As they begin to lose, Putin may stray from what we think of as rational calculations of risk and reward,” Gerstell said. “If his rule is threatened, all bets are off on what thresholds he may cross in terms of cyber response.” Reuters contributed to this report",News/World news,"Russia’s slow cyberwar in Ukraine begins to escalate, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russia-ukraine-cyberwar
4/2/2022,"‘My grandma would always say the spoon has to stand up straight [in a borsch] – it has to be full of vegetables,” says the Ukrainian cook and food writer Olia Hercules in a video we made together of her plant-based borsch. She adds that, while borsch is a soup, it’s also a hearty meal in itself that gets better with time, so she advises making a big batch and enjoying the leftovers over the following days. What strikes me about borsch is that, beyond the beetroot, the other ingredients are pretty flexible, making it a great fridge-raid recipe to use up all kinds of vegetables. Add potatoes and/or any beans, other root veg such as parsnips, turnip or swede, and greens in the form of beetroot leaves or any cabbage or kale – I use both red and green cabbage in today’s recipe, which is in support of the #CookforUkraine initiative. Like the famous Italian ribollita, this vibrant Ukrainian soup is hugely adaptable and can use up all sorts of seasonal odds and ends. To prevent waste, don’t peel any of the veg, and include the cabbage cores and kale stems, both of which can be grated or cut into fine matchsticks along with the beetroot. Olia’s book Summer Kitchens: Recipes and Reminiscences from Every Corner of Ukraine features a borsch with duck and smoked pears, but my recipe is plant-based; if you want, make a thrifty meat version by using a rich duck or chicken stock made with carcasses saved from the butcher’s bin (they often come with scraps of meat on them, so pick this off and add to the soup, too.

Bring to a boil, simmer for five minutes, then add the greens. Return to the boil and simmer for five minutes more, until the greens and roots are tender.

4/2/2022,"After Shuggie Bain was published, Douglas Stuart prepared to pack in writing and go back to the day job. He’d spent 10 years on his debut novel, then it came out during a pandemic. “It was the first week of lockdown. I thought, ‘God, this is the end of my publishing career.’” Stuart couldn’t complain. It had received fabulous reviews, even if nobody was buying it, and he knew he could walk straight back into a top job in fashion. Then Shuggie got nominated for the Booker prize and America’s National Book Award for Fiction. In fact, between 2020 and 2021, it was shortlisted for well over 20 major awards. Not bad for a book that had been rejected by more than 40 publishers. It went on to win the Booker, which inevitably boosted sales. But here was something different. A novel that had been considered inaccessible and unmarketable was selling by the shelfload in supermarkets. To date, it has sold more than 1.3m copies in the English language alone. This brutal love story about a young gay boy trying to protect his alcoholic mother from herself and the ravages of the world, partially written in the Scottish vernacular, had huge popular appeal. Perhaps even more remarkable, Stuart had not read a book for pleasure until he was 16. We meet at a basement bar in the East Village in Lower Manhattan, where Stuart, 45, has lived for the past 21 years. Life couldn’t be more different from the high-rise blocks and tenements where he grew up in Glasgow. It’s here that he made a success of himself as a fashion designer for Calvin Klein and Banana Republic, here that he earned more money than he ever thought possible, and here that he married the man who has been his partner since he was 20. And yet it is Glasgow that continues to define him, not least in his second novel, Young Mungo, published later this month. Stuart’s accent is still distinctly Scottish, but more refined than I’d expected – certainly more so than his characters, most of whom speak in a raw Glaswegian slang. Has America softened the accent? Possibly a little, he says, but the way he speaks is largely down to his mother. She was a proud woman who insisted that he spoke the Queen’s English. “She thought regional accents would hold back your kids; that if you wanted to do well you had to talk like a BBC newscaster. So as a kid I just sounded a bit weirder than the kids around me.” Did they bully him for the way he spoke? He laughs. They hardly needed that as an excuse, he says. From the age of six, they taunted him. “They thought I was queer because I liked dolls, My Little Pony and singing and dancing, and if you gave me a bit of space I’d twirl. But actually the reason they thought I was gay is because I didn’t play football. Every day somebody would call me a poofy wee bastard. I didn’t quite know what they meant, but I knew I should feel ashamed about it.” By this time, he was already the adult in the house – his sister and brother were 15 and 13 years older, and had left home. He would undress his mother when she was too drunk to do it herself, brush out the knots from her hair, make sure she was eating enough, get in bed to warm her up, try to protect her from abuse and gossip, and give her the love she was so desperately missing in her life. “The parent and child relationship from when I was about six was inverted totally. I had to miss school all the time. I had a really disrupted education.” His father had left when Stuart was four; he saw him only twice after that. He was a serial philanderer, and his mother remained hopelessly in love with him. “One of my formative memories is of him leaving. That’s what escalated her drinking. In a way my father killed my mother. It just took 12 more years for her to die from her alcoholism.” Stuart’s mother did any number of jobs to keep the family going – in a chip shop, petrol station, cleaning houses. Ultimately, it was the combination of addiction and searing unemployment under Margaret Thatcher that left the family dependent on benefits. In the early days, he says, she was such fun. “She wanted nothing more than to have a house full of friends and kids. She was really popular, which makes her disintegration harder to bear.” What did she drink? “Anything. If she had enough money, she drank vodka; if she didn’t, she’d drink fortified lager – Special Brew or Tennent’s. Nasty.” His mother was beautiful, and however low she sank, she always looked immaculate – just like Shuggie’s mother, Agnes Bain. She so wanted the family to be cultured that she created an illusion of bookishness in their home. “We had shelves of books that looked like Henry James or Thomas Hardy. But they were just facades – like a Blockbuster video cover, except they were all burgundy leatherette or embossed plastic.” Would he have been able to write Shuggie Bain if his mother had still been alive? “I don’t think I could have, because Shuggie is about loss and grief, so I wouldn’t have had the impetus. I didn’t just want to conjure up hardship and the pain of loving someone with addiction, but also the wonderful small things: her pride, her resilience, her dignity, her glamour. I wouldn’t have needed to have written it if my mother had still been alive.” It was only after winning the Booker that Stuart started to think of himself as an author. “When I woke up the next day I thought, ‘That’s it.’ Until that point I’d been thinking, ‘I’ve got to go and get a job.’” Writing full-time has certainly paid off – Young Mungo has taken him only two years, and is every bit as good as Shuggie Bain. The novel follows schoolboys Mungo (named after the patron saint of Glasgow) and James as they fall in love in a macho environment where any hint of homosexuality is stamped out. Literally. (Mungo’s older brother Hamish outdoes Trainspotting’s Begbie on brutality.) A parallel story describes Mungo’s traumatic fishing trip with two older men. The astonishing thing is that, as with Shuggie Bain, despite the book being soaked in horror, it’s the tenderness that wins out in the end. Stuart’s language is fantastically cinematic. We don’t read Shuggie Bain and Young Mungo so much as see them. He’ll sicken us with cruelty in one paragraph, move us to tears the next, have us belly-laughing by the end of the page. The books are emotional rollercoasters, just as his childhood was. “Sometimes I’d come home and my mum would be having a party, sometimes her head would be in the oven. Twelve years of living with an alcoholic, there were very few scenarios I didn’t see.” What did you do when her head was in the oven? “I just took it out and hoped she was all right. Suicide was always a huge worry. I often found she could be four different types of drunk in a night: fun, then really dangerous, then sad, then suddenly come to life like a revenant. It’s terrifying for a kid dealing with all those personalities. And sometimes she was fine.” We finish our beers and head off to a nearby restaurant. Even on a cold, wet night, New York seems exotic. As a child, did he ever imagine living here? He smiles. “I was a kid who hadn’t even been to Edinburgh, so that would have been a strange concept for me.” He pauses. “It sounds like a piety, but I think of Glasgow as my home and New York is where I am and where I work.” We get to the restaurant and it’s shut. Stuart looks peeved and slightly embarrassed. He says there’s another good place we can go to. As he talks, I make a note in my recorder that he’s stylishly dressed in an understated way – all black. “Navy blue,” he tells the recorder. “Douglas pays attention to these things.” The second restaurant is also shut. “Fucking hell,” he says. “Now you’ve really stumped me. Let’s just have a bit of a walk.” So we wander around looking for food, trying to convince ourselves we’re not freezing. By the time Stuart was 16, his mother was dead. Soon after, his aunt took him aside. “She asked how I was and I said, ‘I feel sad and lost.’ She said, ‘What you have to understand is, everybody’s got a sad story.’ What she was telling me was you have to pick yourself up and get on, because people are visited by tragedy all the time.” After his mother’s death, Stuart got a job, moved into a bedsit, started reading prodigiously and put himself through college. “I was going there all day and working every night in Texas Homecare, straightening the aisles of paint.” Since his early teens he’d been aware he was gay (“Marti Pellow was my sexual awakening – I had a huge crush on him”). He told his brother and sister, and was shocked to find they were shocked. He’d assumed they knew. After all, the whole community had been telling him he was gay since he was six. I ask if his brother is as hard as Young Mungo’s Hamish. “No, he was nothing like that. I was super-close to my brother. He died in a motorcycle accident when I was 21.” Stuart was the first person in his family to complete school. He had wanted to do a degree in English, but his supportive head teacher suggested he would struggle because he had discovered his love of literature so recently. So he found himself the only boy to complete the degree course at the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels, a town in the borders. Money – or lack of it – meant he was still an outsider. He was the only student who couldn’t afford to live in the halls of residence. But for the first time in his life, he says, he felt relaxed in the company of others. “Going to an all-female textile college did huge things for my self-confidence. I felt safe, I wasn’t compared with other men, my sexuality was never questioned. I was just in this place where we were all laughing, creating textiles. It was a pretty sleepy, snoozy place. We’re knitting, weaving, embroidering, it’s not sexy, it’s not disco lights.” He loved it. The college organised an exchange trip for him to Philadelphia, on which he met his future husband, Michael Cary, now an art curator for the Gagosian in New York. “The minute I met him, I fell in love.” Stuart describes the young Michael as “Kurt Cobain meets Morrissey”. He sounds so proud when he talks about him – almost boastful. “My husband is incredibly handsome, incredibly kind, polite, and has no hidden agenda. I felt very safe around him, very loved.” For four years they conducted a long-distance romance. Stuart returned to Galashiels, completed his degree, then did a master’s at the Royal College of Art in London. We find an open restaurant and take a seat under a Covid canvas with heaters blazing overhead. “It’s like a tanning salon. I can have them turn it down,” he says. At the age of 24, Stuart headed back to America, Michael and the fashion industry – starting as an assistant at Calvin Klein and ending up as vice-president of design at Kate Spade, establishing himself as a knitwear expert in the process. “When you’re younger and you start to climb the ranks, it feels really exciting. You have more money and nice holidays, but I got to a point where it was not scratching my creative itch. In fashion, so much is ephemeral. With these international brands you create stuff after stuff after stuff, but people don’t remember it. None of it felt as if it mattered.” There was still something nagging away at him. He began to realise he had not dealt with his mother’s death. He had simply buried his grief – and his childhood along with it. “That’s what made me sit down at 32 and write a book, because I’ve never spoken about it.” He had not even told his husband what his childhood was really like. “He read the first draft and had no idea most of this stuff happened. Shuggie was a way for him to understand poverty, Thatcherism, addiction, because I had no other way to explain it to him.” The wine waiter arrives. “I’ll take something red but not too jammy or sweet or sickly,” he says. “And is it possible to turn the heaters down a bit?” He points to his head. “I don’t want to upset other people, but this bald guy feels like he’s a crispy ham.” Our neighbours thank him – they’re boiling, too. Stuart is a mix of confident and assertive, apologetic and self-conscious. When we speak it’s a month until Young Mungo is published and he is anxious. “I think there’s an enormous amount of pressure once you win the Booker with your debut: people are going to come to your work with a different critical lens, or begin to rebalance accounts, or see if you’ve really got the stuff. So you worry about that.” But the diffidence soon disappears, eclipsed by his passion for his novel. “It’s about performative masculinity; young boys who are being asked to be violent, to be sexualised, to lower their expectations.” Young Mungo is set in a post-Thatcher wasteland of 1992, where older men are unemployed and emasculated, younger men see no point in trying to get a job so they sell drugs, and Catholic and Protestant kids throw bricks at each other as they vie for sectarian supremacy. At the heart of the book is the relationship between Mungo and James. Stuart captures brilliantly the intensity, fumbling clumsiness and innocence of first love. Is this the relationship Stuart wanted as a teenager? “I would have loved it,” he says. But when he was growing up in 80s and 90s Glasgow, he says, there was no sense that this was a possibility. The threat of physical and sexual abuse is omnipresent in the novel. I ask if he was sexually abused. “No, nothing like that ever happened to me.” As for physical violence, he wasn’t so lucky. When he was 16, he was assaulted by a group of teenagers. “There were about 12 of them. They started calling me ‘You fat poof’ and all this, and beat the shit out of me.” They only stopped when a car pulled up. “It was an old woman, a pensioner who stopped in a wee red car with her husband, and she stopped because they thought I was a dog because I was on the ground. My nose was bust, my eyes black. I was cut and bruised all over.” He had never seen the boys before. They were just bored. Does he think they would have killed him if the car hadn’t stopped? “I don’t think they had the ability to stop. You just keep going cos you’re having fun and before you know it you’ve killed somebody or given them brain damage. I remember so vividly the guys taking turns running and jumping on my head and … bang. They were having a great time. After that I just stayed at home and did my homework. It ended my socialisation as a teenage kid because I was so terrified.” Stuart has always suffered with anxiety and says the money raised from events to publicise Young Mungo is going to a mental health charity. How is his mental health these days? “Nice journalistic segue! I’m naturally anxious, and it’s an anxious time before pubishing a book, but generally I’m the happiest I have been. I feel I’m doing the work I was meant to be doing all my life.” Stuart was initially reluctant to acknowledge the autobiographical nature of his work. He thought it might both undermine the fictional element and diminish his past. But now he embraces it. This is his territory, and he could happily mine it for the rest of his writing life. “These characters are very close to my heart. I’m writing about me. I think my entire life’s work will be about searching these wounds. I am fascinated by belonging and families when they disintegrate, about what it means to be young and queer and working class, what it means when you don’t belong in the only place you know. What I’m always writing about is gentleness in the face of oppression. Really, I’m only writing love stories.” Actually, he says, his next novel is going to be totally different. “There is no brother or sister.” He pauses. “But there is an alcoholic mum.” He splutter-laughs. We head off into the night. He walks me part-way to my hotel. I ask if he felt the need to escape Glasgow when he came here. “No. I loved Glasgow, but I’m not sure Glasgow loved me. New York gave me a sense of distance and clarity, but also made me incredibly homesick. I don’t know how you could leave your Glaswegian upbringing at the door. It’s not a mild place. It is a place with a real stamped definition, so wherever I go I am Glaswegian.” As for New York, he says, it has changed. “When I first came it felt like a place where creatives from all over the world were coming to meet and express themselves and have fun. Now it feels like a rich person’s playground. I’m trying to find somewhere to live in Glasgow so I can spend time between both, because it’s a source of inspiration for me and I want to see my family more.” How did they react when he won the Booker? “I think my sister is proud of the book, though the Booker doesn’t mean anything to her. I called her to say I’d won and she was like, ‘Oh, that’s good. You know I tried to return a top to Primark earlier on, and they wouldn’t take it because I forgot the receipt.’ It keeps you grounded.” But two years on, busy writing the TV adaptation of Shuggie Bain, he knows just how big winning the Booker was. “It’s changed my life. It’s changed what I do for a living. Now I feel invited to be part of a literary conversation.” But what means more is the way it has changed his relationship with his home city. He tells me about the mural on the side of the Barrowland Ballroom of Shuggie dancing, accompanied by a quote from his mother, Agnes: “You’ll not remember the city, you were too wee, but there’s dancing. All kinds of dancing.” Stuart can’t contain his delight. “Considering Glasgow inspired every word in that book, that got me. That was tears, and nobody told me it was happening till the day it happened.” He takes out his phone and shows me a photograph of first minister Nicola Sturgeon putting the finishing touches to it. “When you think Glasgow has got a mural of Billy Connolly and St Mungo, and now they’ve also got one of Shuggie Bain. What could be fucking better?” He looks me in the eye fiercely. Proudly. “What could be better?”  Young Mungo by Douglas Stuart is published on 14 April by Picador at £16.99.

4/2/2022,"British-Argentine relations will be stifled so long as the UK refuses to engage in discussions about the future sovereignty of the Falkland Islands, or if both sides continue to act as if the war happened only yesterday, the Argentine foreign minister has said. Writing in the Guardian on the 40th anniversary of the Argentine invasion of the islands in April 1982, Santiago Cafiero called for an improvement in bilateral relations. In an important statement of the Argentine coalition government’s thinking on the islands, he said the UK’s treatment of Argentina at times resembled that handed out to a country in breach of basic human rights norms rather than a nation that has been a democracy for 40 years. He writes: “We believe that no outcome of any war can resolve a dispute recognised by the international community. This would set a dangerous precedent. The 1982 conflict did not alter the nature of the dispute between both countries, which is still pending negotiation and resolution.” The foreign secretary also points out that before the Argentine dictatorship’s surprise invasion, there had for 16 years been negotiations over the substance of the sovereignty of the islands that took into account the interests of the islands’ inhabitants. Pretending that the dispute does not exist or that it does not create obstacles in our bilateral relationship is “naive”, he says. He insists “the two governments share fundamental values and a vision of a rules-based world order. And yet, in the South Atlantic agenda, we behave as if the conflict had taken place just yesterday.” The Argentine invasion caught Whitehall and British intelligence wholly by surprise, leading to a panicked and finely balanced debate within the cabinet about the feasibility of sending a taskforce to free the islands, which the Argentine junta thought Margaret Thatcher did not have the resources, resolve and diplomatic support to do. Contemporary Argentina is a threat to no one, the foreign minister writes, and points out that the pursuit of the historical sovereignty claim in the national constitution is conditional on it being pursued peacefully. “Despite this, the UK maintains a major military base in the South Atlantic, carries out periodic military exercises in the disputed area and maintains restrictions on the sale of dual-use military materials to Argentina,” he writes. He says that these kind of restrictions are reserved usually for countries responsible for serious human rights violations, and finds it “incomprehensible” that such treatment is given to Argentina. He says his government has presented proposals that would be beneficial, such as the re-establishment of regular flights between the Falklands and Argentina. “More flights mean more trade, more tourism and more dialogue, as we have had in the past,” he says, but so far there has been no clear response from the UK to a request to reopen flights. He also points to the great progress by veterans, islanders and the International Committee of the Red Cross to help painstakingly identify the bodies of most of the unknown Argentine soldiers who fell during the UK forces’ retaking of the islands. “We have also made great progress over the last 40 years in humanitarian matters. We were able to identify the remains of more than 120 Argentine ex-combatants and provide an answer to their families, after so many years of uncertainty.” A third excavation is planned with the help of the Commission of Relatives of the Fallen in the Malvinas and South Atlantic Islands. The Argentine invasion, greeted initially with patriotic fervour and politically beneficial to the dictatorship, led ultimately to the collapse of Gen Galtieri’s regime as the death toll mounted and the lack of training of a working-class conscript army became apparent. In total, 649 Argentinian soldiers, 255 British servicemen and three Falkland Islanders died in the conflict. The Malvinas veterans, initially ignored, now have more status, with 2 April a day of memorial. Ever since the defeat, Argentina has pursued various diplomatic initiatives, including the combative one led by the then president, Néstor Kirchner, from 2003 and then from 2007 by his wife, Cristina. Those 13 years included non co-operation over hydrocarbons and a ban on ships entering Argentine ports flying the Falklands Islands flag. A plebiscite on the islands conducted in 2013 revealed a 99.8% desire to remain British, and has been the cornerstone of the UK’s diplomatic stance ever since. In 2016, Argentina reverted to a more conciliatory approach led by the government of Mauricio Macri, but the centre-right former mayor of Buenos Aires fell from power in 2019 after he failed to deliver economic prosperity.",News/World news,Argentina criticises UK refusal to talk about future of Falklands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/argentina-criticises-uk-refusal-to-talk-about-future-of-falklands

4/2/2022,"The weather in the last 10 days of March was ridiculous, and I use “ridiculous” in the sense of an old Scots word, which means unseasonal. And here, I mean unseasonably warm and dry. I have a few old Scots words in my head now. Trees flounce in strong winds. Days with wind and rain are glousterie. Freezing weather is nose-nippin’. There are far fewer words for good weather. On one of these ridiculous days I went walking up on to the moorland. Somehow, my hopes were high that I’d see an eagle – perhaps as a reward as it was my first real day out after 10 days struck down with Covid, when the closest to nature I got was the blackbird that started singing within 10 minutes of 4.29am each morning. The mountains beyond still had small patches of snow in their shadiest nooks, reflecting the colour of the sky, and the landscape felt big and expansive. I heard the deep call of a raven, and scanned the sky for a while before I saw the tiniest black speck, amazed at how the sound carried in the crisp clear air. Apart from the odd puff of cloud and the occasional contrail, the sky remained stubbornly empty, until I started to look closer. Perhaps it was a day for noticing the smaller things, back after a winter’s absence. Meadow pipits’ twittering filled the air, and in their upward display flight they looked as if they were push-push-pushing against the air just for the joy of how they spread their wings and parachuted down to the ground; I watched as they did it again and again. A bright siskin flew among the junipers and stonechats perched on the top of young Scots pines, the males’ black heads and orange bodies popping against the blue of the sky. On the way home, I rejoiced that the pied wagtails were also back, and I heard my first chiffchaff too. In the field, a peacock butterfly landed in front of me, then a small tortoiseshell – everything affirming that spring was, perhaps, here. And yet, by the month’s end, we were in the Borrowing Days, named for March stealing days from April, and bringing back some wintry weather. Sure enough, on the 30th came St Causlan’s flaw – a shower of snow in March.

4/2/2022,"The National Disability Insurance Agency boss, Martin Hoffman, has apologised after his staff used the social media posts of a woman applying for the scheme to challenge her eligibility. Guardian Australia revealed on Friday that NDIA staff had created an “intelligence report” including examples of the woman’s Facebook and LinkedIn posts dating back as far as 2015. The agency’s fraud investigators collected the posts after the woman, in her 30s and living with hypermobility spectrum disorder and chronic pain, had asked the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to overturn the decision to deny her NDIS access. NDIA staff then sent this report to a doctor the agency had asked to assess the woman and provide an expert opinion on her condition. Under questioning from the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John at Senate estimates on Friday night, Hoffman acknowledged the practice was wrong. He said it had only happened once. “I take responsibility as agency head for what my agency did,” he said. “I’ve ascertained that it was a single case. I’ve communicated [to staff] that is was not useful or valuable information, and that action will not be repeated.” Asked if he had apologised to the woman involved, Hoffman said, “I have not as yet”. Asked if he would like to do so during the hearing, he replied, “I think, yes, senator”. “I’m glad the decision was and access was granted … and I certainly regret that my agency used that information at that time,” he said. The tribunal accepted the evidence of the woman and her treating specialist, finding she was eligible for the scheme. This ended a 21-month battle for NDIS support. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The judgment was also critical of the “intelligence report”, which it called “far from sound, on its face”, and the NDIA’s decision to provide the social media posts to its expert witness. The rheumatologist called by the NDIA had drawn upon the “intelligence report” to find the woman did not experience “significant functional impairment” from her chronic pain, the tribunal said. Last October, Hoffman was asked by the Liberal senator Hollie Hughes about reports she had heard from parents that NDIS planners were using social media in the NDIS planning process. Hughes, whose son has autism, said parents were concerned social media posts of their children’s achievements might be taken out of context in determining their needs. At the time, Hoffman replied that it was “not procedure. It is not policy”. “It does not form evidence that is appropriate or suitable for decision-making under the act,” he said. “I’m certainly not aware of that. There’s no internal process like that at all.” On Friday, Hoffman said he “reaffirmed” his evidence from the October hearing. “Use of social media is not part of any planning or access decision-making processes in the agency,” he said. “So this was one case back in 2020 where it was used and I would agree that it was not appropriate or useful information for the purposes of the AAT.” But he suggested there were other cases where NDIS applicants had “exaggerated their functional incapacity”. “This is not a common thing and I’m not suggesting it is a common thing, but it just goes to the wider context in which our staff and the AAT have to make very difficult and complex judgments and decisions,” he said. It comes as Senate estimates also revealed the agency’s spending on external legal fees has soared to $32m in only the past eight months, up from $22m spent across the whole 2020-21 financial year. Advocates have criticised the agency for taking a “combative” approach in the AAT process, which can often see people with disability pitted against externally engaged lawyers from top firms.",News/Australia news,NDIA boss apologises after staff used social media posts to challenge woman’s eligibility,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/ndia-boss-apologises-after-staff-used-social-media-posts-to-challenge-womans-eligibility
